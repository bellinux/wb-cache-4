5|$|The thicker {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro {{it is called the}} head of the badnjak; the main log is laid on the fire with its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its thicker end <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.|$|E

25|$|The Grenville Column {{originally}} {{erected in}} 1749 near the Grecian Valley, it {{was moved to}} its present location in 1756; Earl Temple probably designed it. It commemorates one of Lord Cobham's nephews, Captain Thomas Grenville RN killed in 1747 while fighting the French off Cape Finisterre aboard HMS Defiance {{under the command of}} Admiral Anson, the monument is based on an Ancient Roman naval monument, a rostral column, one that is carved with the prows of Roman galleys <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the shaft. The order used is Tuscan, and is surmounted by a statue of Calliope holding a scroll inscribed Non nisi grandia canto (Only sing of heroic deeds); there is a lengthy inscription in Latin added {{to the base of the}} column after it was moved.|$|E

25|$|Fender skirts {{are often}} made as {{extensions}} of the body panels of the vehicles and cover the entire wheel wells. Much like smooth wheel covers this modification reduces the drag of the vehicle by preventing any air from becoming trapped in the wheel well and assists in streamlining {{the body of the}} vehicle. Fender skirts are more commonly found on the rear wheel wells of a vehicle because the tires do not turn and the design is much simpler. This is commonly seen in vehicles such as the first generation Honda Insight. Front fender skirts have the same effect on reducing drag as the rear wheel skirts, but must be further offset from the body in order to compensate for the tire <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the body of the vehicle as turns are made.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, when {{describing}} the species, Sampson gave a formal list of four traits that distinguish Achelousaurus from its centrosaurine relatives. First, adult individuals have nasal bones with a boss on top that {{is relatively small}} and thin, and heavily covered with pits; secondly, adult individuals do not have true horns above the eye sockets but relatively large bosses with high ridges; thirdly, not yet fully grown individuals, or subadults, have true horncores (the bony part of the horns) above the eye sockets with the inward facing surface being and fourth, the parietal bones of the neck shield have {{a single pair of}} curved spikes <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the rear margin to behind and to the outside.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and American record {{producer}} Jude Cole. It was recorded and produced by John Alagía at his home studio in Easton, Maryland. In an interview with MTV, Wade explained his experience working with Alagía, and said, [...] "When we walked into John's house, we didn't know what to expect, and we {{get in there and}} the mixing board is in the living room, the B3 [...] is in the kitchen and the piano is over there. And he's so nonchalant about all his stuff — there'd be a triple-platinum Dave Matthews Band plaque <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under the bed." [...] "You and Me" [...] was first released via digital download on January 28, 2005. It was then solicited to mainstream radio on March 15, 2005.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Voices Carry" [...] was {{directed}} by D.J. Webster, and filmed at Dorchester's Strand Theater, Davio's Restaurant, and W. Brookline St in Boston. The clip incorporates dialogue and acting, and resembles a mini-movie. The plot centers on the band's lead singer, Aimee Mann, who appears as a musician with an abusive boyfriend, played by actor Cully Holland. He mistreats her for playing in a rock band, and demands that she change her look to fit in his upper-class lifestyle. The video uses spoken dialogue in between to interrupt the musical parts, including Mann's boyfriend demanding: [...] "Why can't you for once do something for me?". At the end, the couple attend a concert at Carnegie Hall where the boyfriend is angered to notice part of Mann's rattail <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under her cap. At her breaking point, Mann lashes out at him, jumping up from her seat in the audience and yelling the lyrics—"He said, shut up! He said, shut up! Oh God, can't you keep it down?..."—as she removes her cap to reveal her spiky, rat-tailed hair, while the boyfriend now hides his face in embarrassment {{and the rest of}} the audience watches in shock.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Brian {{has been}} out of town {{attending}} a seminar on creating a web series and is unaware of what has transpired. On his way home, Brian stops at the Marriott, meets Ida, and starts having drinks with her. Quickly bonding, they retire to Ida's room for sex, with Ida leaving first, then Brian after telling the barman to bill the drinks to her room. The next morning, Brian shares his newfound love with Peter and Lois before showing them a picture of Ida on his cellphone. Peter and Lois go into hysterics, while Brian, unaware of Ida's operation, believes they are just jealous. After Stewie tells him that Quagmire's father has had a sex change and reveals Ida's name, Brian realizes that he has had sex with Quagmire's transgendered father and vomits for almost 30 uninterrupted seconds before the two of them panic. At the same time, Ida returns to Quagmire's home and apologizes, and Quagmire returns the favor, reconciling their relationship. Ida tells Quagmire that she met someone, and when she says it was Brian, whom Quagmire despises, he becomes furious. Brian is traumatized for no reason after finding out about Ida and, when he hears Quagmire come inside the house, he tries to hide under Peter and Lois' bed, but Quagmire finds him easily, because Brian's feet were <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under the bed, and brutally beats him, thus threatening to blow his head off if he goes near Quagmire's house. Brian gets the final word — [...] "Hey, I fucked your dad." [...] — and angrily slams the door shut.|$|E

2500|$|The Italian torpedoes (Finnish {{designation}} [...] "T/40") {{proved to}} be unreliable in service despite functioning during test range firings. It was later discovered that these torpedoes were unreliable when fired from a submerged sub because the increased water pressure caused the seals of the torpedo detonators to fail. For this reason a report that the Finns received from the besieged Hanko that a Soviet freighter had arrived there with two Finnish torpedoes <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> its hull became more believable.|$|E
2500|$|The Lehner Ranch site is {{a mammoth}} kill site in the San Pedro Valley in Cochise County in [...] {{southeast}} Arizona. In 1952 Haury began investigating an arroyo where a rancher, Edward F. Lehner, had observed bones <b>sticking</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> a deep layer. These bones were identified as mammoth bones. After excavating several projectile points were found in situ with the mammoth bones. Also a hearth was discovered. Lehner Ranch became another one of Haury's seminal works in Southwestern Paleoindian archaeology.|$|E

50|$|One {{important}} {{idea when}} evaluating the friction behavior within a fracture {{is the impact}} of asperities, which are the irregularities that <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the rough surfaces of fractures. Since both faces have bumps and pieces that <b>stick</b> <b>out,</b> not all of the fracture face is actually touching the other face. The cumulative impact of asperities is a reduction of the real area of contact, which is important when establishing frictional forces.|$|R

2500|$|The {{kernel of}} Craig's {{interpretation}} {{lay in the}} staging of the first court scene (1.2).

In the foreground in dark shadow, Hamlet lay as if dreaming. A gauze was hung between Hamlet and the court, so that on Claudius' exit-line the figures remained but the gauze was loosened, so that they appeared to melt away as Hamlet's thoughts turned elsewhere. The scene received an ovation, which was unheard of at the MAT. Despite hostile reviews from the Russian press, the production attracted enthusiastic and unprecedented worldwide attention for the theatre and placed it [...] "on the cultural map for Western Europe." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the MGM film, an {{adolescent}} farm girl named Dorothy (played by Judy Garland), her dog Toto, and their farmhouse are swept away from Kansas by a tornado {{and taken to}} the magical Land of Oz.

When the Wicked Witch of the West comes to claim her dead sister's shoes, Glinda magically transfers them to Dorothy's feet.

Throughout {{the rest of the}} film, the Wicked Witch schemes to obtain the shoes. When she captures Dorothy, she tries to take the slippers, but receives a painful shock. The Wicked Witch then realizes that the slippers will only come off if the wearer is dead, so she decides to kill Dorothy.
