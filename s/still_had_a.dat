5|$|Africa {{separated}} from Antarctica around 160million years ago, {{followed by the}} Indian subcontinent, in the early Cretaceous (about 125 million years ago). About 66 million years ago, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tropical to subtropical climate, complete with marsupial fauna and an extensive temperate rainforest.|$|E
5|$|As {{the quarter}} {{came to an}} end, the Hokies gained two quick first downs and {{advanced}} the ball 26yards, seemingly having regained the momentum lost with the blocked kick. With onequarter remaining in the game, however, Kansas <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> three-point lead, 1714.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the third}} quarter, any hope of victory was {{seemingly}} out of reach for Virginia Tech. Three quick plays after the kickoff resulted in a first down before time ran out, but at {{the end of the}} third quarter, Florida State <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> 273 lead.|$|E
5|$|In a 1988 TV special, series creator Gene Roddenberry said that, as {{with the}} first pilot, this one <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of science-fiction {{elements}} in it, {{but at least it}} ended with Kirk in a bare-knuckle fistfight with Mitchell and that's what sold NBC on Star Trek.|$|E
5|$|Against these setbacks, the CTR <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> record year in 1928, {{with over}} 30 million journeys. But from 1929, the buses {{took to the}} narrow streets in the city centre, as well as routes with low tram traffic such as Chartreux, Maromme and the circular. The tramways {{continued}} as going concerns, and started large programmes of renovation and modernisation in {{the dozen or so}} years before World War II. Between 1928 and 1932, 75 first-generation trams were rebuilt to allow one man operation.|$|E

5|$|As {{the issue}} of his college {{eligibility}} was playing out, Gambino was being courted by several professional football teams. The Chicago Bears of the NFL, which had drafted him during the war, <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> strong interest in him, as did the Baltimore Colts of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Baltimore eventually acquired Gambino, and to do so, they traded their first-round 1948 draft selection to the Cleveland Browns, who held Gambino's AAFC draft rights.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new season on December 31, 2015, Clinkscales and Tony Benett were both reinstated after applying to return to the league. The two players received unanimous support from the NBL Canada Board of Governors. Bennett was only suspended for two games and received a $500 fine, while Clinkscales <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> $5,000 fine. On March 11, 2016, Rainmen player Tyrone Watson was also reinstated to the league after paying his $5,000 fine and receiving a unanimous vote. Joey Haywood would also return in the following season.|$|E
5|$|Despite Nebraska's early-season loss, the Cornhuskers <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{chance to}} win a record-setting third {{consecutive}} national championship. A win against Texas would earn Nebraska a bid to the Sugar Bowl and a game against No. 1 Florida State to decide the national championship. Unfortunately for Nebraska, the underdog Longhorns upset heavily favored Nebraska, 3727. Eight days after losing to Texas, Nebraska was awarded a bid to the Orange Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his success}} on the field, Macartney <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> regular job outside of cricket, as with most cricketers of the era. In 1914, he left his job on the Sydney wharves and joined the staff of New South Wales Railways & Tramways in the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office at Redfern. The {{following}} season, he scored 191 runs at 38.20 including a century in three matches. He did not take a wicket.|$|E
5|$|In March 1979 James Callaghan's Labour {{government}} fell, and {{a general}} election was called for 3 May. This led to a brief delay in {{the start of the}} trial as Thorpe, who <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> following among North Devon Liberals, was adopted as their candidate in the election. Largely isolated from his party's national campaign, he lost the seat to his Conservative opponent by over 8,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|Mayfair is {{the most}} {{expensive}} property on the standard British Monopoly board at £400, and is part of the dark blue set with Park Lane. It commands the highest rents out of all properties; landing on Mayfair with a hotel costs £2,000. The price is a reference to the property values in the area, which have remained consistently high, with real-life rent as much as £36,000 per week. At the time the board was being designed in the 1930s, Mayfair <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> significant upper-class residential population.|$|E
5|$|Paintings {{of early}} modernist {{painters}} such as Damián Domingo often <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> religious association but {{the art of}} Juan Luna and Félix Hidalgo showed a trend towards political statement. The first Philippine national artist Fernando Amorsolo used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated aspects of Philippine culture, while other artists such as Fernando Zóbel used both realistic and abstract techniques.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{won their}} first five games in 2009, but lost their next four. After beating the Atlanta Falcons in overtime, they lost badly to Denver on Thanksgiving. They {{defeated}} Dallas 31–24 in Week 13, then lost 45–38 to Philadelphia the next week. At 8–6, they <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{chance to make}} the playoffs, but losses to Carolina and Minnesota to finish the season left {{them out of the}} playoffs at 8–8.|$|E

5|$|The Luftwaffe was to {{spearhead}} {{the aerial}} {{battle in the}} low countries. Its first task was {{the elimination of the}} Belgian air contingent. Despite an overwhelming numerical superiority of 1,375 aircraft, 957 of which were serviceable, the air campaign in Belgium had limited success overall on the first day. At roughly 04:00, the first air raids were conducted against airfields and communication centres. It <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tremendous impact on the AéMI, which had only 179 aircraft on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|The Navy, however, <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{requirement}} for a ship capable of defeating enemy cruisers {{and the original}} concept was revived as Project 69. The proposed size of the ship continually escalated as the requirement was revised {{to allow it to}} fight larger ships like the German s. The preliminary design was finally approved in January 1939 and two ships were laid down in November 1939, before the detailed design had even been approved.|$|E
5|$|The {{win over}} Virginia Tech gave the Eagles a 2–1 conference record, and they {{appeared}} to be destined for a bid to the ACC Championship Game. But Boston College lost its next two games, both against conference opponents, dropping its record to 2–3. Despite the losses, Boston College <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to win the Atlantic Division—but only if other teams lost as well. This happened on November 6, when fellow Atlantic Division team Maryland lost to Virginia Tech, and the Eagles recovered from their losing streak with an out-of-conference win against Notre Dame.|$|E
