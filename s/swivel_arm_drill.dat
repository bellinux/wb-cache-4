5000|$|A radial <b>arm</b> <b>drill</b> {{press is}} a large geared head drill press in which the head can be moved along an arm that radiates from the machine's column. As it is {{possible}} to swing the arm relative to the machine's base, a radial <b>arm</b> <b>drill</b> press is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece. This saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the drill head than it is to unclamp, move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table. The size of work that can be handled may be considerable, as the arm can swing {{out of the way of}} the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with a radial <b>arm</b> <b>drill</b> press, but more often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture. Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common. Larger size machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the arm. The biggest radial <b>arm</b> <b>drill</b> presses are able to drill holes as large as four inches (101.6 millimeters) diameter in solid steel or cast iron. Radial <b>arm</b> <b>drills</b> are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm. The length of the arm is usually the same as the maximum throat distance. The Radial <b>Arm</b> <b>Drill</b> pictured in this article is a 9-inch column x 3-foot arm. The maximum throat distance of this drill would be approximately 36", giving a swing of 72" [...] (6 feet)..|$|R

40|$|During eye surgery, {{the surgeon}} uses an {{illuminating}} instrument called an opthalmoscope for {{close examination of}} the retina or {{the interior of the}} eye. Ordinarily, electric power for the head-mounted light is supplied through a cord from an overhead <b>swivel</b> <b>arm</b> or a floor pedestal. Within limits of cord length and <b>swivel</b> <b>arm</b> movement, the surgeon has considerable freedom of motion. But when more than one opthalmoscope is involved, tangling and interference of the power cords becomes a problem. St. Luke's Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio asked Lewis Research Center for assistance in finding a solution. Lewis responded with a battery-powered system that totally frees the surgeon of attached cords and swivels. Borrowing from space technology, Lewis used small, lightweight nickel-cadmium batteries that can deliver high intensity light for an hour and can be recharged overnight. The Opthalmoscope Powerpack consists of eight batteries in three containers affixed to a webbed belt, and a novel on-off switch equipped with a springloaded plexiglass "flapper. " The belt pack is worn underneath the surgical gown and the flapper permits the doctor to activate the switch by elbow pressure. Lewis built five units and they have been in service at St. Luke's Hospital for a year. Used for routine examinations as well as for surgery, they have demonstrated excellent reliability...|$|R

5000|$|Foot and <b>arms</b> <b>drill</b> {{commands}} {{are taught}} using a formulaic method {{known as the}} Screed.

The Screed usually begins [...] "Taking you a stage further in your foot/arms drill I will now teach you the â€¦ Irish word of commandâ€¦" [...] and includes instructor demonstrations and time set aside for soldiers in the recruit sections to practice the movement in pairs on the square. Although this system is meant to teach movements correctly and quickly, and set a standard of foot and <b>arms</b> <b>drill</b> throughout the forces, it is not favoured by many drill instructors who see it as too rigid, promoting an atmosphere of mindless obeyance which fails to produce good soldiers who can think for themselves.|$|R
