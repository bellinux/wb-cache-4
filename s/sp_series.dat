40|$|AIM: To {{localize}} nestin positive cells (NPC) in {{pancreatic tissue}} of mice of different ages. METHODS: Paraffin sections of 6 - 8 μm of fixed pancreatic samples were mounted on poly-L-lysine coated slides {{and used for}} Immunolocalization using appropriate primary antibodies (Nestin, Insulin, Glucagon), followed by addition of a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. The antigen-antibody localization was captured using a confocal microscope (Leica <b>SP</b> 5 <b>series).</b> RESULTS: In 3 - 6 d pups, the NPC were localized towards {{the periphery of the}} endocrine portion, as evident from immunolocalization of insulin and glucagon, while NPC were absent in the acinar portion. At 2 wk, NPC were localized in both the exocrine and endocrine portions. Interestingly, in 4 -wk-old mice NPC were seen only in the endocrine portion, towards the periphery, and were colocalized with the glucagon positive cells. In the pancreas of 8 - wk-old mice, the NPC were predominantly localized in the central region of the islet clusters, where immunostaining for insulin was at a maximum. CONCLUSION: We report {{for the first time the}} immunolocalization of NPC in the pancreas of mice of different ages (3 d to 8 wk) with reference to insulin and glucagon positive cells. The heterogeneous localization of the NPC observed may be of functional and developmental significance and suggest(s) that mice pancreatic tissue can be a potential source of progenitor cells. NPC from the pancreas can be isolated, proliferated and programmed to differentiate into insulin secreting cells under the appropriate microenvironment...|$|R

These games are typically visual novels, a genre of adventure games, but some have also been sound novels, which has less attributes of an adventure game than a normal visual novel. The video games produced are ported to the PlayStation 2 or Nintendo DS. Since ASCII Media Works is a continuation of MediaWorks, the company includes the video games previously produced before the merger with ASCII on their official website for their video games. The video games produced are organized into categories for similarly made games. Aside from the main class of visual and sound novels produced, three games were re-released in the Dengeki <b>SP</b> <b>series</b> at reduced prices from their original release; SP stands for [...] "special price". Another class produced exclusively for the Nintendo DS are under the brand imprint series DS Dengeki Bunko, and are games based on light novels published under ASCII Media Works' male light novel imprint Dengeki Bunko.

5000|$|The tools have {{featured}} in the Mamod range of steam toys since the company's inception in 1937. Very early tools featured simple flat bases with Meccano-spaced holes. These early tools also have Meccano-like pulleys fitted with crudely made sand cast iron bodies. They continued after {{the war in the}} pre-war form until 1948 when, along with the SE1, SE2 and MM2 engines the hammer and Power Punch (later [...] "Power Press") were fitted with the new hot stamped brass flywheels. At the same time Malins Engineers moved to Camden Street, Birmingham. With this move the company acquired some power presses and the new brass-wheeled tools (and polisher/grinder) began to get raised bases. The cast iron bodies for all the tools were replaced by Mazak around 1950. The pressing facilities also enabled the MM1 engine to be the first steam toy in the Malins range to be produced with a raised baseplate. Apart from the change from brass to Mazak flywheels in 1953 and the disappearance of oiling points by the 1960s, the tools changed very little over the years. By 1979 the tools had changed to a blue and red colour scheme (replacing the green/red scheme used on all the engines and tools up until then) inline with the new <b>SP</b> <b>series</b> of engines. Due to the financial situation, the tools as separate items disappeared from the range in the mid-1980s along with the SP1, 3 and 5 but were together in the WS1 workshop introduced in 1979. In the early 2000s the individual tools reappeared.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} a new tree-ring width data set of 14 white spruce chronologies for the Seward Peninsula (SP), Alaska, based on living and subfossil wood dating from 1358 to 2001 AD. A composite chronology derived from these data correlates positively and significantly with summer temperatures at Nome from 1910 to 1970, after {{which there is}} some loss of positive temperature response. There is inferred cooling during periods within the Little Ice Age (LIA) from the early to middle 1600 s and late 1700 s to middle 1800 s; and warming from the middle 1600 s to early 1700 s. We also present a larger composite data set covering 978 – 2001 AD, utilizing the SP ring-width data in combination with archaeological wood measurements and other recent collections from northwestern Alaska. The Regional Curve Standardi-zation (RCS) method was employed to maximize po-tential low-frequency information in this data set. The RCS chronology shows intervals of persistent above-average growth {{around the time of}} the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) early in the millennium, which are comparable to growth levels in recent centuries. There is a more sustained cold interval during the LIA inferred from the RCS record as compared to the <b>SP</b> ring-width <b>series.</b> The chronologies correlate significantly with Bering and Chukchi Sea sea surface temperatures and with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. These atmosphere–ocean linkages probably account for the differences between these records and large-scale recon-structions of Arctic and Northern Hemisphere temper-atures based largely on continental interior proxy data. ...|$|R
40|$|The halichondrins, {{isolated}} from the Kaikoura sponge Lissodendoryx <b>sp.,</b> are a <b>series</b> of polyether macrolides displaying potent in vivo antitumour activity. As such, they represent important leads as potential anticancer drugs. This research was focused on methodology that would enhance and complement the progress of halichondrins toward clinical trials. A method was established for transforming 53 -methoxyneoisohomohalichondrin B, an artefact of the methanol extraction method, to the more useful isohomohalichondrin B. A by-product of this acid treatment was identified as the C 38 epimer of isohomohalichondrin B. The equilibrium character of the C 38 epimerisation was studied. The production of halichondrins by aquacultured Lissodendoryx sp. has been confirmed. Haptens presenting the macrocyclic portion of the halichondrins were produced using three different linkers PMPI, PMSI and EMCR. The chemistry required to selectively oxidise the C 26 methylene was established. A polymer drug conjugate incorporating a halichondrin species has been prepared.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{electronic}} and geometrical structure of impurity-vacancy complexes in Si and Ge. Already Watkins suggested that in Si the pairing of Sn with the vacancy produces a complex with the Sn-atom at the bond center and the vacancy split into two half vacancies on the neighboring sites. Within the framework of density-functional theory we use two complementary ab initio methods, the pseudopotential plane wave (PPW) method and the all-electron Kohn-Korringa-Rostoker (KKR) method, to investigate the structure of vacancy complexes with 11 different sp-impurities. For the case of Sn in Si, we confirm the split configuration and obtain good agreement with EPR data of Watkins. In general we find that all impurities of the 5 sp and 6 <b>sp</b> <b>series</b> in Si and Ge prefer the split-vacancy configuration, with an energy gain of 0. 5 to 1 eV compared to the substitutional complex. On the other hand, impurities of the 3 sp and 4 <b>sp</b> <b>series</b> form a (slightly distorted) substitutional complex. Al impurities show an exception from this rule, forming a split complex in Si and a strongly distorted substitutional complex in Ge. We find a strong correlation of these data {{with the size of}} the isolated impurities, being defined via the lattice relaxations of the nearest neighbors. Comment: 8 pages, 4 bw figure...|$|E

40|$|SP (The Swedish National Testing and Research Institute) {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{research}} institutes in Sweden. With a multi-disciplinary approach the aim is to contribute significantly to innovation and growth in industry and to a sustainable development in the society as a whole. SP is a national institute with a comprehensive competence in a number of profile areas such as: Building, Energy, Fire and fire protection, Materials, Transport, Electronics, Measurement techniques. We co-operate with all sectors, universities, institutes, industry, users and organisations of society and politics. This is essential to contribute efficiently to growth in the innovation system. In particular we co- operate with universities for synergy of aspects in performing research. We prioritize international co-operation, e. g. in EU-projects. This is important for exchange of knowledge, influence and creation of confidence and networks facilitating trade and increasing competitiveness. SP is a private company (like Chalmers) with all shares held by the Swedish state. The organisation is flat with a high degree of delegation, which enhances flexibility and multi-disciplinarity. The technical departments have overall responsibility for economy, personnel, equipment, research, marketing etc according to an annual plan and following the common strategies and policies. Many of the R&D activities at SP are co-financed and SP receives grants from around 20 of the Swedish research councils, funds and authorities in competition. This financing has increased considerably during the last decade, while the government grants for development of new knowledge through R&D have decreased slowly. The governmental grants were about 9 % of SP's total turnover in 2002. The staff comprises 550 persons (man years). Of these 97 have a Ph D (72) or a licentiate degree (25). A further 140 persons have a masters degree, and there are also a number with a B Sc. This means that the technical areas/environments at the departments in general have a sustainable research competence and capacity for tutoring of Ph D students. There are 35 Ph D students at SP, generally employees of SP with a project in co-operation with a technical university, for courses and formal exam requirements, and with supervision from SP's researchers. SP has co-operation in around 90 projects with a large number of departments at Swedish universities and university colleges, with a concentration to Chalmers, KTH and LTH. There is also co-operation with 15 of the Swedish research institutes and program boards (as Brandforsk, Elforsk and Värmeforsk). Internationally, SP co- operates with 90 institutes, mostly Nordic and European, and to a large extent in the 5 th Framework program. In this program SP participated in 43 projects and as co-ordinator in 6. All in all SP has a wide co-operation in research and a strong international network. Not least should be mentioned organisations as Eurolab, Euromet, EGOLF (fire), ENBRI, RILEM, IABSE, CIB (building), Eurachem, ENCRESS (software), ADLNB (telecommunication), EMCIT/EMCEL (electronics), CEEES (environment), IEA (energy), ESIS (mechanics) and VAMAS (materials). In 2002 SP researchers published 233 reports, papers etc. A total of 169 of the publications were in external journals, conference proceedings, and theses.
