The flint was sourced from either the South Coast of England or France, and then shipped to the Port of Liverpool or Shardlow on the River Trent. After shipping to the watermills locally to the potteries, or commercial flint grinding mills in either the Churnet Valley or Moddershall Valley by pack horses, it was sorted to remove the flint with reddish-hues, and then heated to [...] to create an easily ground product. A group involving James Brindley later patented a process for reducing the fine <b>siliceous</b> <b>dust</b> by using a water based process, thereby reducing the risk to workers of suffering silicosis.

The catalytic {{effect of a}} negatively charged silica surface site on addition reactions to adsorbed unsaturated organic molecules is investigated computationally. Adsorbates bind relatively strongly to the silanolate group (SiO-) with a pronounced weakening of their multiple bonds, which results in {{a significant reduction in}} the activation barrier of the H atom addition to COads, H 2 C = O-ads, H 2 C = CH 2,ads and HC CHads with respect to the corresponding gas phase barriers. More strikingly, the sizable gas phase barrier (21 kJ/mol) for the O- 3 + CO reaction is almost entirely removed. This strong catalytic effect allows for effective CO 2 formation in dark molecular clouds where other routes are inefficient.

40|$|The {{birthplace of}} stars, planets, and small bodies are {{molecular}} clouds consisting mainly of H and He gas {{as well as}} tiny amounts of solid particles. Dust and gas from such an interstellar cloud collapsed to form a central condensation that became the Sun, {{as well as a}} surrounding disk — the solar nebula. In this protoplanetary disk innumerable submicrometer particles — icy and refractory in nature — agglomerated to larger planetesimals and subsequently into planets. Comets were formed from remnant inner disk material that was not incorporated into planets. Comets assembled beyond the orbit of Jupiter and may therefore provide a record of some pristine material from the parent interstellar cloud. Our knowledge of the composition of comets is predominantly based on evaporation of volatile species and thermal emission from <b>siliceous</b> and carbonaceous <b>dust</b> when bright comets approach the Sun. The investigation of outgassing curves from bright comets has provided a general link with abundances of ices and gas phase molecules detected in dense interstellar clouds. Theoretical models indicate that bulk material in cometary nuclei is stratified in density, porosity, and composition and contains coexisting ice phases, possibly clathrates and trapped gases. It is therefore apparent that the outgassing of species from cometary nuclei will not essentially mimic that expected from pure sublimation of ices of interstellar composition. The current lack of astronomical data related to solar-type star-forming regions, and the statistically small sample of comets studied to date, are the major obstacles to be overcome before a coherent link between interstellar and solar system material can be established. This chapter attempts to compile the current knowledge on the connection between interstellar and cometary material, based on observations of interstel-lar dust and gas, observations of cometary volatiles, simulation experiments, and the analysis of extraterrestrial matter. 1...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the exposure- response relationship between prolonged exposure to low levels of silica, uranium, radon progeny and criteria pollutants and the respiratory health of uranium workers. Method Initially two pilot studies were done on selected groups of high-risk workers to determine the prevalence of alpha- 1 -antitrypsin deficiency and the retained burden of uranium in the lungs of exposed workers. The value of sputum cytology was also evaluated. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 1984 to determine the prevalence of spirometric abnormalities among uranium miners. The data from non-smokers without symptoms was used to develop lung function reference values relevant for the present population. Follow up analytical cross-sectional and case control studies were done in 1996 and 1999 to determine the mean independent effect of uranium on the respiratory health of miners and to detect abnormalities in both smokers and non¬smokers. Data was collected on employment history, smoking habits, pulmonary function and chest radiographs. To determine the independent mean effect of uranium mining on the respiratory health of workers, only data of non-smokers in exposed cohorts were compared with unexposed control cohorts. Results The prevalence of alpha- 1 -antitrypsin appeared to be high in workers with abnormal spirometric indices. The lung burden of retained uranium in workers in the final product recovery area was within normal limits. The sputum cytology was abandoned because it was found worldwide that cytological screening had no impact on population survival rates. Lung function prediction equations derived from multiple linear regressions were calculated for the study population which differed from Schoenberg et al prediction equations. The data from the analytical cross-sectional study in 1996 suggests that the level of exposure in this study group (without the confounding effect of cigarette smoking) is not associated with statistically significant impairment of lung function, increased prevalence of silicosis, tuberculosis and respiratory cancer. Only the FEF 75 was found to be an indicator of early lung abnormality. Data from the 1999 study supports the hypothesis that there is a small but significant exposure-response relationship between prolonged exposure to low levels of silica dust, and lung function abnormalities (in the absence of radiologically diagnosed silicosis). The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and small airways disease (SAD) was small but significantly higher in exposed workers. The risk of developing COPD was 2. 7 times higher for exposed workers. The risk for non-smokers was small but significant. The incidence of tuberculosis and lung cancer was not higher than expected (probably because ex-employees were not fully investigated). Conclusion Calculation of location specific prediction equations, for different ethnic groups is advocated to enable the earliest detection of lung function abnormalities. FEF 75 could be used as an early indicator of lung function impairment (provided strict quality control is maintained). Exposure to a combination of silica dust, radon progeny and smoking was associated with an increased risk of lung function abnormalities, but not with tuberculosis, silicosis and lung cancer. Conclusive assessment must await sufficient latency, and ex-employees must be investigated to establish the true magnitude and distribution of the effects of <b>siliceous</b> and uranium <b>dust</b> on the health of workers (which may continue after exposure cease).

40|$|The heat {{transfer}} process {{that results from}} gaseous diffusion through the nucleus is shown to {{play a significant role}} in modeling comet nuclei. In this paper, a comprehensive comet nucleus model is presented which simulates the eftlux of gas from surface and interior layers, The model includes 3 volatile components; CO, C 02, and H 20, and a <b>siliceous</b> <b>dust</b> component. Mass, momentum, and energy balance equations are solved at the surface and interior layers. Equations of state for ices based on the latest thermodynamic data; the Brown and Ziegler [1979] relationship for the sublimation of C 02 and CO at low pressure and the Lowe [1977] expression for water vapor at low pressure are used with the model. Variability in the matrix parameters of density, porosity, friability, tortuosity, pore radius of the matrix, ancl phase of the interstitial ices, are options explored with the model.

40|$|Previous {{knowledge}} of silicosis in the Swedish granite industry {{suggested that the}} disease was neither common nor severe. In recent years, however, changes in working methods have involved a considerably increased formation of dust, and it was considered likely {{that the risk of}} contracting silicosis was increased. Reports from other countries supported this conjecture. The 34 known cases of silicosis caused by quarrying and working of granite in Sweden were therefore reviewed. The mean duration of exposure to <b>siliceous</b> <b>dust</b> when stage I silicosis was diagnosed was 32 years, and the mean age at diagnosis was 55 years. Despite the relatively long 'prediagnosis ' exposure to dust, the disease showed a pronounced tendency to progression, and six cases were complicated by pulmonary tuberculosis. Eighty per cent of the men were awarded disablement benefit because of their pulmonary lesions, and four men died from silicosis alone or in combination with tuberculosis. In Swedish granite works there is room for considerable improvement in dust suppression. Careful checks of such preventive measures and periodic medical examination of exposed persons are strongly advocated. Technical Backgroun...|$|E

The protective value of a coating system {{is proportional to the}} surface preparation; the objectives of the surface preparation are the surface cleanliness and the surface profile of the substrate. The surface preparation is usually achieved by blast cleaning using different types of abrasive. Due to its high hardness and low cost, silica sand has been used extensively for impact abrasion. It is, however, very brittle with most grain disintegrating on impact, causing excessive levels of <b>siliceous</b> <b>dust</b> which is a major health hazard and causes serious environmental pollution. Consequently, it has been banned as impact abrasive material in most countries around the world. Considerable research has been done in the last twenty years to find an impact abrasive material as hard as silica and that respects. So it was important to search for sand substitution among the local abundant minerals in Egypt. Waste product obtained from ilmenite ore extracted from the mine was found to be the most suitable alternative abrasive. This work shows the abrasive types, the occurrence of the ilmenite ore. The chemical properties, physical properties and microscopic examination of the waste were investigated.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Hard Rock Miners Phthisis in 19 th and Early 20 th Century Britain: From Diagnosis to CompensationByFredric MintzDoctor of Philosophy in HistoryProfessor Thomas Laqueur, ChairThe {{development}} of new technologies and new patterns of working were indispensable to the accelerated economic growth, which characterized most of nineteenth century Britain. For much of that period the demand for raw siliceous containing materials increased sharply. In this process, equipment, which was ever more sophisticated, generated increasingly fine and more harmful <b>siliceous</b> <b>dust,</b> increasing early disability and death in mines and quarries {{as well as in}} numerous other industries. The present study examines the elaboration of silicosis, the disease, and the {{development of}} social policy directed at its prevention and compensation from the 1830 s until 1918. I concentrate mainly on the nineteenth century and the twentieth century until 1907. In 1907, the law recognized that an occupational disease was a notional injury and a few became compensable. Others, including silicosis were certain to follow. Both the etiological elaboration and prevention of silicosis, and, ultimately compensating its sufferers occurred over a very long period. My major subject is the causes of this time lag. While this study emphasizes mining and quarrying, workers in siliceous industries outside of these occupations had the same issues. Others have reviewed the nature of medical practice in the nineteenth century but medical interest or disinterest in occupational disease during that period has only received cursory coverage. Indeed, this is characteristic of the slighting of occupational disease as opposed sanitation by historians during most of the period I have studied. While some investigators have alluded to the early public health emphasis on worker well-being, I also address how occupational health became a secondary consideration for most of the nineteenth century, despite its promise of achieving as much as &# 8213;Chadwickian&# 8214; sanitation, at much less cost. In this, Chadwick and his coterie of second-generation utilitarians with their stress on engineering as opposed to medical investigation were largely responsible. The government created commissions and committees to learn more about occupational health conditions. However, it appears that it offered these, without much intent to follow through, but rather, as a temporarily sop to placate those with a special interest in the subject. This work studies in more depth than others of which I am aware, the 1862 - 64 Commission of the Condition Of All Mines In Great Britain To Which The Provisions Of The Act 23 & 24 Victoria Do Not Apply (coal mines). During those proceedings, I found that the etiology and partial prevention of silicosis were clearly established. This information was relegated to the blue books for reasons that I also investigate. When interest in silicosis revived, there was little or no reference to this work. 2 Students of the subject have noted that in the 1880 s British medicine was anecdotal and derived from experience in private practice. I have attempted to show how this influenced the elaboration of a specific disease, silicosis. In addition, medical teaching, membership in societies and with an interest in some aspect of medicine, (very likely, what submissions were accepted to medical journals as well) were controlled by a metropolitan medical elite with little or no scientific, social or pecuniary interest in the diseases of miners. This view was transmitted to general practitioners as well. Another aspect of the present work, different from most, has involved a careful reading of all the issues of The Lancet and The British Medical Journals from 1864 through 1906. I found relatively few articles relating to silicosis, confirming that the readers` level of interest was not very great. In addition to demonstrating a paucity of articles about miners` lung disease, these journals also reported on the controversial role of tuberculosis in the elaboration of silicosis. Failure to scientifically address this debate significantly delayed compensating for and preventing silicosis. Additionally, I show that the journals revealed a terminological obfuscation that made the understanding of what silicosis was, very difficult. Various authors commented on this confusion but their criticism {{does not appear to have}} resulted in any editorial attempt to rectify the problem (assuming that any editorial intervention existed). The science of statistics was in advance of other medical tools and did provoke some interest in silicosis but the journals and reports of the commissions also show how statistics were manipulated to minimize the incidence of silicosis. Moreover, organizations presumably having a keen interest in the etiology and prevention of silicosis (and its compensation) were often, themselves, a source for the lag. These included unions, mine and quarry owners, both the Liberal and Conservative Parties, the public health establishment and, to a lesser extent, the mining and quarry inspectorate. Most work on this subject studies the post-WWI period. This work shows that these organizations had distinctly different attitudes about compensation legislation than they held the in the twentieth century. In the process of arriving at the correct etiology of silicosis, and, as a result, whether it should be indemnified, all interested parties picked through what was on offer to patch together some commonality of position that had little to do with any adherence to an overall structure, coherency or rational knowledge. Inevitably, their motives were an admixture of highly parochial and shortsighted deliberations and considerations that were more altruistic. Any attempt on the part of various parties to act in unison was a material and a practical matter and had little to do with systematic logic. The authority of the interested organizations related to the power that sustained them and to what was required to disrupt them and bring about fragmentation. In this process, as Bruno Latour has pointed out, the content of what was achieved, always involved fusion with the context. This work concludes that when problems resist timely solutions, the reasons are always multiple and that they shift over time without result until a reconciliation of various social and cultural differences becomes possible. In fact, reconciliation did occur despite the fact that the motivations of the negotiating parties were contradictory...|$|E
