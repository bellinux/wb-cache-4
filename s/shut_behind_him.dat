60|$|When {{the door}} <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> {{she went back}} into the room and wrung her hands.|$|E
60|$|He {{rested his}} cue against the table, {{and put on}} his coat. Jimmy {{followed}} {{him out of the}} door, which he <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... (He goes out. The outer door {{is heard}} <b>shutting</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> [...] Nicholls closes the door, rear, {{and comes back}} and sits in the [...] {{chair in front of}} table. He rests his chin on his hands and [...] stares before him, a look of desperate, frightened {{calculation}} [...] coming into his eyes. Carmody is heard clumping heavily down [...] the stairs. A moment later he enters. His expression is glum and [...] irritated.) ...|$|R
60|$|He {{laid his}} hand upon my {{shoulder}} and blessed me. He went. I heard the door <b>shut</b> to <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> the echoes of his footsteps slowly died away.|$|R
6000|$|It sure is, but I guess I earn every cent of it. (First Man enters through door {{at right}} He moves hurriedly but cautiously. <b>Shuts</b> door <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> but neglects to re-lock it.) ...|$|R
6000|$|The man {{bowed and}} went, and {{presently}} Castell, listening, heard {{a side door}} <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> Then he turned and said to the other two: ...|$|E
60|$|As Bradley {{passed out}} at the gate with an {{undecided}} foot, he heard it <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> and heard the footstep of the man coming after him.|$|E
60|$|Passing {{through the}} entrance, Nigel {{followed}} his guide, and the negro let {{the heavy door}} <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> with a clang that was depressingly suggestive of a prison.|$|E
60|$|Saying this he {{left the}} room hastily, <b>shutting</b> the door <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> with a bang.|$|R
50|$|When {{the story}} of the final dream is told, the five ponder the meaning of their nightmares. The lift door opens, and they find {{themselves}} looking out onto a graveyard. They walk out, becoming decomposing corpses, and disappear one by one. Sebastian stays behind, and explains that they are damned souls compelled to tell {{the story of}} their evil deeds for all eternity. He then turns back into the room (which is now the inside of a tomb with a coffin in the centre) and the door <b>shuts</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|When he had <b>shut</b> {{the door}} <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> Valencia put the letter into the Major's hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{going to}} be a vacancy at Pinkerton's or I'm mistaken. Leave it at that, McMurdo. At nine to-morrow we'll be with you. You once get the door <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> and you can leave the rest with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|I said I {{could not}} hear such words from him, and begged him in tears to go away; he obeyed, and I heard the garden door <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> What {{is to be the}} end of the announcement, and the fate of Caroline? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come to the {{conservatory}} in an hour, and I'll {{show you the}} best part of a 'German,'" [...] he said, with a nod and a smile, as he went away, beginning to whistle like a boy when the door was <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{then she}} rung the bell. Macassar went downstairs perhaps {{somewhat}} slower, with perhaps more of melancholy {{than when he}} entered. The page opened the hall-door with alacrity, and <b>shut</b> it <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> with a slam.|$|R
60|$|The captain, who {{was close}} behind his messenger, entered {{at once and}} <b>shut</b> the door <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Bang!--it was <b>shut</b> to <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> and {{he found}} himself {{standing}} in the darkness of midnight, with the splendid clothes upon his back, and the magic purse with its hundred pieces of gold money in his pocket.|$|R
60|$|The {{boys were}} still a hundred feet or more away from the {{habitation}} when the man reappeared at the doorway. On catching sight of the newcomers he uttered a sudden cry of dismay, and then disappeared like a flash, banging the cabin door <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The poor, whimpering girl-wife {{followed}} her culprit husband {{up the steps}} and into the cold and gloomy hall to which they were admitted, her eyes on the floor, her sleeping child held tightly in her arms. When the gate <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> Curtis signed to the prisoner this advice: ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the last}} moment a large black priest was crammed in, and the door <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> Every {{available}} seat was let down and occupied. The second great post-omnibus rolled away, and then the one for Mola followed, rolling Alvina and Ciccio over {{the next stage of}} their journey.|$|E
60|$|McPhail pushed Barney out, <b>shut</b> {{the door}} <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> {{and stood on}} the steps, looking at the crowd.|$|R
60|$|Closing the window, {{she went}} into the passage and opened the street door; it was hardly {{unlocked}} before Jim had pushed his way in; partly <b>shutting</b> it <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> he took her in his arms and hugged her to his breast. She kissed him passionately.|$|R
60|$|He was gone, and had <b>shut</b> {{the door}} <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> They {{looked at each}} other, and nodded approvingly: Dennis stirred up the fire.|$|R
6000|$|... [The {{secretary}} retires, and {{the servant}} shows {{in a man}} who calls [...] himself GUILLET DE GEVRILLIERE--a tall, thin figure of thirty, [...] with restless eyes. The door being <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> he is left [...] alone with the minister. FOX points to a seat, leans back, and [...] surveys his visitor.] ...|$|E
60|$|He did so and was {{ushered into}} a delicious little boudoir, whose windows, not {{larger than a}} foot square, were filled with pink, blue, and yellow glass. Here, the door being softly <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> Lancey {{found himself in the}} {{presence}} of the red-bearded officer whom he had met on board the Turkish monitor.|$|E
60|$|To her, as {{has been}} said, was given wisdom beyond most women. She {{did not try to}} prevent him as he kissed her good-by. But when the door had <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> a little cry escaped her, and she ran to the window to strain her eyes after him until he had turned the corner below.|$|E
50|$|Anakin {{locates the}} power core, but a panicked Robonino <b>shuts</b> the door <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> Alama and Sing then attack Anakin, and Robonino shocks him into unconsciousness.|$|R
6000|$|Hazard, {{looking in}} again: [...] "Perfect fit, {{just as the}} Jew said, and the very color for Fountain." [...] He vanishes, <b>shutting</b> the door <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
50|$|Klein {{died during}} {{the sinking of the}} RMS Lusitania in 1915, at the age of 48, {{reportedly}} entering the Grand Staircase, and <b>shutting</b> the door <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{you must}} not warm my heart with your kindness,' was the answer. 'No, no, never fear, when I'm not with any one who has seen Ballymakilty, I can speak English so that I could not be known for a Galway man. Not that I'm ashamed of my country,' he added; and the next moment the door <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks." [...] Kramer loped {{across the}} field, toward the black shape that rose up above him, {{extended}} across {{the width of}} the field. The ramp was down {{from the side of the}} cruiser and he caught hold of it. The ramp rose, and a moment later Kramer was inside the hold of the ship. The hatch slid <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|So, {{going to}} the first door, he opened it and ventured slowly into the dimly lighted corridor. When he had {{advanced}} a few steps he heard {{the door of his}} room slam <b>shut</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> He ran back at once, but the door of rock fitted so closely into the wall that he found it impossible to open it again. That did not matter so much, however, for the room was a prison and the only way of escape seemed ahead of him.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} unfortunate events take place from this moment on. Andy {{is about to}} take a shower at the house when he realises that the water is {{switched}} off. He goes outside in his robe to switch it on, when the front door <b>shuts</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> and locks automatically. Andy is stranded outside in the garden, and has to wait in the shrubbery until his parents arrive home from the country club. Before {{he has a chance to}} get inside the house again, a passing police man discovers him hiding in the bushes. The police man doesn't believe Andy's story when he tries to explain his business in the garden, and insists on taking him inside to get a confirmation from his parents.|$|R
6000|$|McFarlane entered {{slowly and}} <b>shut</b> the door <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> His manner was serious, {{and his voice}} gravely gentle as he said: [...] "I hope that {{telegram}} does not call you away?" ...|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{he rushed}} {{out of the}} room, and <b>shut</b> the door <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> with great violence, leaving his {{guardian}} astonished at his sudden and violent change of temper and manner.|$|R
