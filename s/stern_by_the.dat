The column was quickly spotted, and engaged {{for the next two}} hours by Allied artillery and aircraft causing heavy losses. The 1st Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment and the 100th Panzer Regiment, attacking from west of the canal, had more success reaching the beaches between the British landing area of Sword and the Canadian Juno. At 13:30, the men at the bridges heard the sound of bagpipes, played by Bill Millin of the 1st Commando Brigade. As the commandos arrived, they crossed the bridges and joined the rest of 6th Airborne Division defending the eastern perimeter. Some of the tanks accompanying the commandos moved into Bénouville to reinforce its defences, while others crossed the bridges with the commandos. At 15:00, a boat loaded with German infantry approached from Caen. It was engaged with the anti-tank gun manned by number One Platoon, hit in the <b>stern</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> second round fired and then retreated back toward Caen.|$|E

500|$|Titanic was {{subjected}} to extreme opposing forces– the flooded bow pulling her down while {{the air in the}} stern kept her to the surface– which were concentrated at one of the weakest points in the structure, the area of the engine room hatch. Shortly after the lights went out, the ship split apart. The submerged bow may have remained attached to the <b>stern</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> keel for a short time, pulling the stern to a high angle before separating and leaving the stern to float for a few minutes longer. The forward part of the stern would have flooded very rapidly, causing it to tilt and then settle briefly until sinking. The ship disappeared from view at 02:20, 2 hours and 40 minutes after striking the iceberg. Thayer reported that it rotated on the surface, [...] "gradually [...] her deck away from us, as though to hide from our sight the awful spectacle...

500|$|The {{ship was}} badly damaged during an air raid on Kiel on 13 December. One bomb struck the {{forecastle}} {{and started a}} severe fire while four others landed inside the dry dock itself, riddling her with splinters and sinking the ship. Paul Jacobi was not refloated until April and the refit itself was not completed until November. The ship had to be fitted with a new bow section, new radars, and a new goalpost-shaped foremast to allow the radar antenna to rotate a full 360°. After being damaged again by bomb splinters during an air raid on 18 July, she was towed to Swinemünde to be completed. Paul Jacobi was declared operational on 13 November and she escorted the hospital ship [...] from Gotenhafen to Swinemünde. The destroyer's new 3.7cm guns were installed on 20 December. While conducting torpedo training off the Swedish island of Gotland on 14 January 1945, one of her torpedoes circled back around and hit Paul Jacobi, inflicting only minor damage. She was back in action by the 19th, escorting ships in the eastern Baltic Sea.

In December, Richard Beitzen, together with her sisters , Georg Thiele, and Max Schultz, sailed to the area of Iceland to evaluate their seaworthiness in a North Atlantic winter with their new bows. On 23–24 March 1939, the ship was one of the destroyers that escorted Adolf Hitler aboard the pocket battleship [...] to occupy Memel.

60|$|A neat boat, {{manned by}} natives in uniform, and steered by the doctor of the port, put from shore towards {{three of the}} afternoon, and pulled smartly for the schooner.

60|$|We both laughed, {{and were}} still {{laughing}} when a wild scream of rage {{came out of}} the darkness, and the approaching boat shot under our <b>stern.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> light of the lantern it carried we could see the two men in it distinctly. They were foreign-looking fellows with sun-bronzed faces, and with knitted tam-o'-shanters perched seaman fashion on their heads. Bright-colored woolen sashes were around their waists, and long sea-boots covered their legs. I remember yet the cold chill which passed along my backbone as I noted the tiny gold ear-rings in the ears of one. For all the world they were like pirates stepped out of the pages of romance. And, to make the picture complete, their faces were distorted with anger, and each flourished a long knife. They were both shouting, in high-pitched voices, some foreign jargon we could not understand.|$|E

60|$|His {{words were}} smothered by the rushing and gurgling of waters. The vessel made a plunge like a dying whale; and, raising its stern {{high into the}} air, glided {{into the depths of}} the sea, like the {{leviathan}} seeking his secret places. The motionless boat was lifted with the ship, until it stood in an attitude fearfully approaching to the perpendicular. As the wreck descended, the bows of the launch met the element, burying themselves nearly to filling; but, buoyant and light, it rose again, and, struck powerfully on the <b>stern</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> settling mass, the little ark shot ahead, {{as though it had been}} driven by the hand of man. Still, as the water rushed into the vortex, every thing within its influence yielded to the suction; and, at the next instant, the launch was seen darting down the declivity, as if eager to follow the vast machine, of which it had so long formed a dependant, through the same gaping whirlpool, to the bottom. Then it rose, rocking, to the surface; and, for a moment, was tossed and whirled like a bubble circling in the eddies of a pool. After which, the ocean moaned, and slept again; the moon-beams playing across its treacherous bosom, sweetly and calm, as the rays are seen to quiver on a lake that is embedded in sheltering mountains.|$|E
