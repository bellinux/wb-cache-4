50|$|Also in 1968, Chrysler made {{approximately}} fifty fastback Barracudas {{equipped with}} the 426 CID L Hemi for Super Stock drag racing. These cars were assembled by Hurst Performance and featured items such as lightweight Chemcor side glass, fiberglass front fenders, hood scoop, lightweight seats, <b>sound</b> <b>deadener,</b> and other street equipment such as rear seats omitted. An included sticker indicated that the car was not for use on public roads; it could run the quarter-mile in the mid-tens in 1968.|$|E
5000|$|Chassis {{dynamometer}} {{information from}} well documented stock examples reinforces that estimate. Similarly, {{this level of}} acceleration performance is on par {{with that of a}} production line stock, 2013+ V6/ speed manual transmission Accord (278 SAE Net HP), which shares a similar curb weight. It should be noted that a Holman and Moody specially prepared [...] "stripper", which carried no <b>sound</b> <b>deadener,</b> undercoating, or any optional factory equipment, was used as the introductory press car in 1968.|$|E
50|$|It {{included}} low-gloss Icy White Metallic {{body color}} with red accents and door graphics, carbon fiber hood, fenders, door and deck lid; exposed carbon fiber front splitter, rockers and adjustable rear wing; unique lower grille and brake ducts, removal of carpeting, <b>sound</b> <b>deadener</b> and rear seat; Ace suede-covered racing {{steering wheel and}} shifter, SCCA-approved roll cage and window net, racing driver's seat with five-point harness, racing pedals, fire suppression system, fuel cell, video camera system mounted on the roll cage, LS3 6.2L V-8 enhanced with Chevrolet Performance Parts' camshaft, cylinder heads and dry-sump oiling system; production six-speed manual transmission with Corvette ZR1 twin-disc clutch, low-restriction air induction and exhaust systems, 4-wheel disc racing brake system with six-piston front/four-piston rear calipers and drilled and slotted rotors, modified production suspension with Pfadt licensed components, 20-inch racing wheels and tires.|$|E
50|$|To keep weight low, {{fiberglass}} fenders and hood were used. The hood {{featured a}} functional hood scoop and four hood pins for full lift off {{removal of the}} hood. Lightweight acid dipped steel doors with thin side window glass were used. The doors lacked a window mechanism and to slide the windows, a strap {{was attached to the}} bottom of the glass. To keep glass up, the strap latched to the inside of the door. The interior included only two bucket seats from a Dodge van. Center console, heater, <b>sound</b> <b>deadeners,</b> side view mirrors, radio, carpeting, and even arm rests were deleted to save weight.|$|R
5000|$|The 1993 Cobra R was {{the first}} of three Cobra R models produced, and it was an {{extremely}} exclusive vehicle. As the [...] "R" [...] designation in its name stood for [...] "Race", the car did not have a radio, speakers, wiring and antenna, air conditioner, foglights, <b>sound</b> <b>deadener,</b> rear seat, rear safety belts, rear carpeting, and roll-up cargo cover, among other items. There were no power options; the car had power steering, roll-up windows, manual door locks, and manual-adjustable mirrors. Also, manually-adjustable Opal Gray cloth bucket seats from the Mustang LX were lighter than the GT/Cobra sport seats, and a piece of thin gray carpeting secured by Velcro covered the bare hatch and rear seat area. The deletion of all this equipment shed some 450 pounds, but it was somewhat offset by the necessary addition of heavy-duty hardware to enable the car to handle the rigors of competition.|$|E
5000|$|The Mazda Familia Infini was {{produced}} from 1989 to 1990 {{as a special}} Japan only special sport trim line of the four-door Familia. Much of the Infini trim {{is similar to the}} American LX version, equipped with the 1.8 DOHC BP-ZE engine and 5-speed manual. The Infini was upgraded with a viscous limited slip differential, tightened suspension package, and bonnet/headlight style similar to the 323 hatchbacks. In 1994, these were facelifts were adopted on all Familia sedan models. The Infini came only in dark green color with unique Infini trim grille, rear spoiler, [...] "lightweight" [...] carpet, without <b>sound</b> <b>deadener,</b> and with Infini (∞) logos on horn button, front grille, wheel caps, and bootlid. There were also unique factory front clear indicators, a Momo steering wheel, BBS 15" [...] rims, suede interior with GTX style seat trim, leather gearboot & knob, front and rear strut braces, 22 mm sway bars front and rear, rear tie bar, and a 7100 rpm redline tachometer, as well as 250 mm four-wheel disc brakes. Around 1,000 Infinis were produced, and preceded Mazda's ɛ̃fini Japanese dealership network.|$|E
