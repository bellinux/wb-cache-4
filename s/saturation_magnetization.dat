Constant field magnetization reversal measurements {{at room temperature}} show that these samples reverse by slow nucleation followed by relatively rapid domain wall motion. The samples with larger uniaxial anisotropies and smaller <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetizations</b> reverse completely for applied fields less than the coercivity, while those samples {{on the other end}} of the spectrum do not.

30|$|FeOOH–Au hybrid {{nanorods}} {{have been}} synthesized via layer-by-layer assembly, {{which can be}} transformed into α-Fe 2 O 3 –Au and Fe 3 O 4 –Au hybrid nanorods by controllable annealing process. The strong electrostatic attraction between AuCl 4 − and polyelectrolyte-modified FeOOH nanorods plays the most {{important role in the}} uniform deposition of Au nanoparticles. The annealing atmosphere determines the phase transformation from FeOOH–Au to α-Fe 2 O 3 –Au and Fe 3 O 4 –Au. The as-synthesized Fe 3 O 4 –Au hybrid nanorods show the high <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetizations,</b> and α-Fe 2 O 3 –Au hybrid nanorods show the low <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetizations,</b> respectively. The UV–vis analysis indicates that both Fe 3 O 4 –Au and α-Fe 2 O 3 –Au hybrid nanorods show a broad peak located at about 525 nm.

40|$|Hysteresis {{measurements}} {{have been}} carried out on a suite of ocean-floor basalts with ages ranging from Quaternary to Cretaceous. Approximately linear, yet separate, relationships between coercivity (Bc) and the ratio of <b>saturation</b> remanence/saturation <b>magnetization</b> (Mrs/Ms) are observed for massive doleritic basalts with low-Ti magnetite and for pillow basalts with multi-domain titanomagnetites (with x= 0. 6). Even when the MORB has undergone lowtemperature oxidation resulting in titanomaghemite, the parameters are still distinguishable, although offset from the trend for unoxidized multidomain titanomagnetite. The parameters for these iron oxides with different titanium content reveal contrasting trends that {{can be explained by the}} different <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetizations</b> of the mineral types.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} static {{micromagnetics}} is to solve for the {{spatial distribution of}} the magnetization M at equilibrium. In most cases, as the temperature is {{much lower than the}} Curie temperature of the material considered, the modulus |M| of the magnetization is assumed to be everywhere equal to the <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetization</b> Ms. The problem then consists in finding the spatial orientation of the magnetization, which is given by the magnetization direction vector m = M/Ms, also called reduced magnetization.|$|E

Q-carbon is harder than diamond by 10-20% because carbon is metallic in the molten state and gets closely packed, with a bond length smaller than that in diamond.

30|$|The <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetizations</b> and {{blocking}} temperatures {{of the samples}} were measured using a Quantum Design MPMS- 7 {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) magnetometry. Aliquots (100  μL) of the samples were applied to Qtips® cotton swabs (Unilever, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA) and allowed to dry. The samples were then scanned using temperature sweeps up to 340  K by zero-field cooling the sample and measuring the magnetic moment as a function of temperature {{in the presence of a}} 1 -mT magnetic field during heating and subsequent cooling. The values for the blocking temperatures were then extrapolated from the peak location in the resultant zero-field cooled (ZFC) curve. Similarly, the applied magnetic field was swept from − 5 to 5  T at room temperature (293.15  K) to measure the magnetic moment as a function of applied field. The data was fit over a range of points approaching 5  T to determine the <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetizations</b> of the samples. After the SQUID magnetometry measurements were completed, the cotton swab samples were digested in acid and the iron content was quantified using ICP-OES, as described above. The iron concentration was then used to calculate the mass magnetizations of each sample.|$|R

50|$|The ideal FeS lattice, {{such as that}} of troilite, is non-magnetic. Magnetic {{properties}} {{vary with}} Fe content. More Fe-rich, hexagonal pyrrhotites are antiferromagnetic. However, the Fe-deficient, monoclinic Fe7S8 is ferrimagnetic. The ferromagnetism which is widely observed in pyrrhotite is therefore attributed to the presence of relatively large concentrations of iron vacancies (up to 20%) in the crystal structure. Vacancies lower the crystal symmetry. Therefore, monoclinic forms of pyrrhotite are in general more defect-rich than the more symmetrical hexagonal forms, and thus are more magnetic. Upon heating to 320 °C, pyrrhotite loses its magnetism, but also starts decomposing to magnetite. The <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetization</b> of pyrrhotite is 0.12 tesla.|$|E

Such systems exhibit a lower saturation field and a larger δH than superlattices with antiferromagnetic coupling. A similar effect is observed in Co/Cu structures. The existence of these structures means that GMR does not require interlayer coupling, and can originate from a distribution of the magnetic moments that can be controlled by an external field.|$|E
