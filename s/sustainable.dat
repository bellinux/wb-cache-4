5|$|In ecology, {{sustainability}} (from sustain and ability) is {{the property}} of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely. Long-lived and healthy wetlands and forests are examples of <b>sustainable</b> biological systems. In more general terms, sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes. The organizing principle for sustainability is <b>sustainable</b> development, which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture. Sustainability science {{is the study of}} <b>sustainable</b> development and environmental science.|$|E
5|$|Moving towards {{sustainability}} is also {{a social}} challenge that entails international and national law, urban planning and transport, local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism. Ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities and <b>sustainable</b> cities), reappraising economic sectors (permaculture, green building, <b>sustainable</b> agriculture), or work practices (<b>sustainable</b> architecture), using science to develop new technologies (green technologies, renewable energy and <b>sustainable</b> fission and fusion power), or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner, and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources.|$|E
5|$|Other approaches, {{loosely based}} around New Urbanism, are {{successfully}} reducing environmental impacts by altering {{the built environment}} to create and preserve <b>sustainable</b> cities which support <b>sustainable</b> transport. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts {{across a range of}} measures, compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. In <b>sustainable</b> architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a <b>sustainable</b> approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote <b>sustainable</b> land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.|$|E

The Fourth European <b>Sustainable</b> Cities and Towns Conference, held in Aalborg in 2004, adopted the more binding Aalborg Commitments on local <b>sustainable</b> development. The commitments have now been signed by 650 local authorities while over 2,500 have signed the earlier Aalborg Charter.|$|E
5|$|At {{the global}} level the {{environmental}} impact of agribusiness is being addressed through <b>sustainable</b> agriculture and organic farming. At the local level there are various movements working towards local food production, more productive use of urban wastelands and domestic gardens including permaculture, urban horticulture, local food, slow food, <b>sustainable</b> gardening, and organic gardening.|$|E

5|$|The Roundtable on <b>Sustainable</b> Biofuels is an {{international}} initiative which brings together farmers, companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists {{who are interested in}} the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution.

Adopted by the 189 United Nations member states at the time and more than twenty international organizations, these goals were advanced to help achieve the following <b>sustainable</b> development standards by 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} is to support biofuel development, including {{the development of new}} cellulosic technologies, with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is <b>sustainable.</b> Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance <b>sustainable</b> economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.|$|E

25|$|When {{looking at}} the <b>sustainable</b> {{practices}} of the large logging companies in the DRC, they are less than <b>sustainable.</b> According to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), a leader in certification for <b>sustainable</b> forestry practices, GBE will not be pursuing FSC certification for their practice in the DRC. In addition to the country's major logging companies not pursuing <b>sustainable</b> logging practices, it is common place for logging to take place illegally within protected forest areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{programmes}} work {{areas were}} <b>sustainable</b> building, transport, office consumables and waste. The <b>sustainable</b> building work stream built the financial case (The Value Case for <b>sustainable</b> building in New Zealand) for setting best practice performance targets {{for new and}} existing Government buildings. The <b>sustainable</b> building team worked with the industry to develop New Zealand specific performance targets and benchmarks (funded the industry adopt of the Green Star NZ rating scheme) to raise the overall environment and economic performance of Government buildings (all new buildings were to be 5 Star Green Star NZ by 2012).
