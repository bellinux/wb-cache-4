30|$|Quantifying {{wildland}} fire emissions {{is a critical}} step in evaluating <b>smoke</b> impacts. <b>Smoke</b> <b>emissions</b> estimates {{require the use of}} modeling pathways that combine multiple sources of data and the linking of scientific models in a logical, progressive sequence. Fire emissions are typically modeled using information on fire size and location, coupled with fuel loading maps, which are then processed through consumption models capable of producing emissions estimates. In a complex modeling process, numerous options are available, and managers, scientists, and others who model fire emissions need to understand the uncertainties and differences in this process. Intercomparisons, such as the one conducted here, provide insights into the sensitivity of <b>smoke</b> <b>emissions</b> estimates to the variability present at each step in a modeling pathway. Use of accurate fire information and local fuels data is critical to reducing the amount of uncertainty in the overall modeling chain. The first step to providing better estimates of <b>smoke</b> <b>emissions</b> is to provide better estimates of the fuels available to burn. Under-or over-estimating fire size can lead to inaccurate representations of the amount of fuel available to burn, the amount of fuel consumed during a fire, and subsequently unrepresentative estimates of <b>smoke</b> <b>emissions.</b> Additional uncertainty when modeling <b>smoke</b> <b>emissions</b> can be introduced by the available fuel loading maps. For example, we found that all modeled fuel loading maps studied underestimated total woody fuel loading when directly compared with field-sampled fuel loading data. Locally produced fuel loading maps such as the OkWen custom FCCS fuel loading map can reduce some of the uncertainty due to fuel loading inaccuracies; however, our results suggest that fuel loading, and subsequent <b>smoke</b> <b>emissions,</b> are commonly underestimated on wildfire in the Pacific Northwest. Examination of other fires as part of SEMIP (N. Larkin, unpublished data) shows similar results, suggesting that the uncertainties identified here are important areas for future research and development.|$|R
30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{potential differences}} in <b>smoke</b> <b>emissions</b> due to alternative fire information data, fuel inputs, fuel consumption modeling, or alternative <b>smoke</b> <b>emissions</b> computation, we analyzed model output {{at each level}} in the modeling pathway (Figure 1). We compared fire size {{for each of the}} five fire reporting systems, and compared fuel loading among the seven fuel loading maps. Using each of the seven fuel loading maps as inputs, we compared fuel consumption and emissions for the two fuel consumption and emissions models.|$|R
50|$|The team started {{training}} for aerobatics in late 2001. The Squadron Commander of INAS 551, then, was Cdr J.S. Tewatia. The work-up {{at that time}} was, however, informal. The drive gained formal momentum {{in the latter half}} of 2002. The paint scheme of the aircraft was changed to the current one and the aircraft were modified for <b>smoke</b> <b>emission</b> with the inboard stations modified for carriage of kerosene tanks mixed with colour dyes (without a dye, kerosene puts out white smoke). The Team was initially called as Sagar Kiran and it is under this name that the team made its formal inaugural debut display (then with only three aircraft) in Kochi, India on 11 May 2003 for the Golden Jubilee of the Indian Naval Aviation. The founding Leader of the Team was Cdr. Surendra Ahuja.|$|E
5000|$|Early efforts had {{relied on}} {{education}} such as teaching {{people how to}} build cleaner fires - but this had almost no impact. It was soon realized that real improvement would only come about by switching to a cleaner fuel - gas, oil, coke, or anthracite were all considered but ruled out on cost grounds. The alternative was to wash and size the existing soft coal to make it burn hotter and cleaner, and ensure that all coal sold in St. Louis was of this variety. In February 1937 a smoke ordinance was passed creating a [...] "Division of Smoke Regulation in the Department of Public Safety", forcing larger businesses to burn only clean coal and setting standards for <b>smoke</b> <b>emission</b> and inspection. By 1938 emissions from commercial smokestacks had been reduced by two-thirds.|$|E

30|$|As {{our results}} show, {{considerable}} uncertainty can {{be associated with}} modeling <b>smoke</b> <b>emissions.</b> This {{does not mean that we}} should abandon the modeling approach for estimating <b>smoke</b> <b>emissions.</b> Rather, our results show that, with some careful thought, managers can pick an appropriate option at each step in a <b>smoke</b> <b>emissions</b> modeling pathway. For example, the best option for estimating the area burned by the Tripod Fire Complex was the MTBS fire perimeter, which was easily accessible and spatially verified by the MTBS project team. Locally specific fuel loading maps such as the OkWen fuel loading map (custom FCCS fuelbeds) should be used when available, as this fuel loading map best matched the field observed fuel loadings available for this project. If custom, locally produced fuelbeds are not available, the standard FCCS fuelbeds (FCCS 2) available from LANDFIRE (www.landfire.gov) should be used.|$|R
30|$|The {{differences}} in modeled <b>smoke</b> <b>emissions</b> rates illustrate {{the importance of}} the selection of <b>emission</b> factors for <b>smoke</b> <b>emissions</b> modeling. FOFEM produced higher emissions for CO, CH 4, PM 2.5, and PM 10, while Consume produced higher CO 2 emissions. These results are due to different emission factors used in the FOFEM and Consume emissions calculations and the way each model handles the partitioning of fuel consumption into the flaming and smoldering phases. Further understanding of the emissions process, and translation into an empirical description, will help to reduce these differences.|$|R

40|$|Smoke {{emissions}} {{have long}} been quantified after-the-fact by simple multiplication of burned area, biomass density, fraction of above-ground biomass, and burn efficiency. A new algorithm has been suggested, as described in Ichoku & Kaufman (2005), for use in calculating smoke emissions directly from fire radiative power (FRP) measurements such that the latency and uncertainty associated with the previously listed variables are avoided. Application of this new, simpler and more direct algorithm is automatic, based only on a fire's FRP measurement and a predetermined coefficient of <b>smoke</b> <b>emission</b> for a given location. Attaining accurate coefficients of <b>smoke</b> <b>emission</b> is therefore {{critical to the success}} of this algorithm. In the aforementioned paper, an initial effort was made to derive coefficients of <b>smoke</b> <b>emission</b> for different large regions of interest using calculations of <b>smoke</b> <b>emission</b> rates from MODIS FRP and aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements. Further work had resulted in a first draft of a 1 1 resolution map of these coefficients. This poster will present the work done to refine this algorithm toward the first production of global <b>smoke</b> <b>emission</b> coefficients. Main updates in the algorithm include: 1) inclusion of wind vectors to help refine several parameters, 2) defining new methods for calculating the fire-emitted AOD fractions, and 3) calculating <b>smoke</b> <b>emission</b> rates on a per-pixel basis and aggregating to grid cells instead of doing so later on in the process. In addition to a presentation of the methodology used to derive this product, maps displaying preliminary results as well as an outline of the future application of such a product into specific research opportunities will be shown...|$|E

The integrated <b>smoke</b> <b>emission</b> dataset improves the prediction of modeled AODs. We find that the modeled cloud properties and precipitation are extremely sensitive to the smoke loadings. Higher smoke loadings suppress precipitation initially, because of smoke-induced reduction of the collision-coalescence and riming processes, but ultimately cause an invigoration of precipitation.

40|$|Potential {{reduction}} of <b>smoke</b> <b>emission</b> of marine diesel engines is investigated through {{the installation of}} an exhaust bypass system featuring two diesel particulate filters in the Laboratory of Marine Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens. This system differs from the ones already in use in the automotive industry because it charges only during engine transient loading {{in order to avoid}} early filter contamination. The exhaust flow is controlled by the operation of two butterfly valves. When the engine is idle or operating in steady state the first valve is fully open and the exhaust gas flows through the main duct unfiltered. In case of engine transient loading, during which there is high <b>smoke</b> <b>emission,</b> the second valve gradually opens leading part of the exhaust gas into the filters. When it is almost fully open, the first one closes and the exhaust gas is being fully filtered until the engine operates in steadier conditions. Then, the valves are moved to their initial positions. The efficiency of the method, in terms of <b>smoke</b> <b>emission</b> reduction, is assessed by measuring the exhaust gas opacity after the filters. Furthermore, the differential pressure across the filters is measured, as well as the system back pressure, in order to estimate the soot load in the filters {{and its impact on the}} engine operation. The project includes the supervision of the construction and proper installation of the exhaust bypass system in the exhaust processing unit of the laboratory, the acquisition and mounting of all sensors, the installation of the necessary subsystems and the conduction of the experiments. In the context of this project, opacity measurements on a high speed passenger vessel are also carried out in order to evaluate the opacity sensor performance, as well as to observe the <b>smoke</b> <b>emission</b> from an engine operating in real conditions. In addition, a brief description of the radio – frequency soot sensing technology is performed in order to decide whether to use this or the state of the art differential pressure in order to estimate the soot load in the filters. The main objective is to develop a system that will reduce efficiently and in a safe way the <b>smoke</b> <b>emission</b> of diesel engines without interfering in their overall operation. Furthermore, additional issues must be considered so that the system will be suitable for retrofit in marine engines...|$|E
