The testis is composed of anterior (AT) and posterior (PT) lobes, that are partitioned into lobules by connective tissue trabecula, and further divided into zones (germinal, transformation and evacuation), each with various stages of cellular differentiation. The vas deferens is classified into three distinct regions: anterior (AVD), median (MVD), and posterior (PVD), {{on the presence of}} spermatophores and two secretions, termed substance I and II.

The first groups (I) received vehicle alone to serve as control. The second, third and fourth groups (II, II and IV) of animals were administered the leaf extract daily at 50 mg/kg body weight, p. o., 100 mg/kg body weight, p. o., and 200 mg/kg body weight, p. o., respectively, {{for a period of}} 60 days. ResultsSignificant decreases in the weight of testes, epididymis, seminal vesicle and ventral prostate were observed. A dose related reduction in the testicular sperm count, epididymal sperm count and motility, number of fertile male, ratio between delivered and inseminated females and numbers of pups were observed. The testis showed a clear correlation between the dose and severity of lesions of seminiferous epithelium. In general, the seminiferous tubules appear reduced in size with a frequently filled eosinophilic material. Spermatogenesis arrested at the <b>secondary</b> <b>spermatocyte</b> stage.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Interstitial cell tumor of the testis in {{an adult}} male can present with feminization and psychologic changes. The feminization and psychologic changes most likely refEect {{production}} of estrogen by the interstitial cell tumor. Removal of the tumor causes rapid return of the pituitary-testicular axis to normal, loss of feminization, and development of male psychosocial characteristics. Interstitial cell tumors of the testes are rare. ’ They a%ect two distinct age groups, prepubertal males and adults. In the prepubertal male, the tumor is usually associated with precocious pu-berty; in adults, it {{may be associated with}} feminization although the majority of adults have no evident endocrine disturbance. When feminization occurs, it is associated with psychologic change and abnormal hormone pro-duction. Case Report A twenty-six-year-old male was found to have an asymptomatic left testicular mass. He admit-ted to decreased libido and impotence and had undergone a reduction mammoplasty two years previously. Physical examination revealed a well-developed male with normal escutcheon and secondary sex characteristics except for mild unilateral gynecomastia. A 1. 5 by 1. 5 -cm. firm irregular mass occupied the upper pole of the left testis. A well-circumscribed tumor of the upper pole was found at time of orchiectomy. Histologically, the tumor was interpreted as a benign interstitial cell tumor with suppressed spermatogenesis at the <b>secondary</b> <b>spermatocyte</b> level in the remaining seminiferous tubules (Fig. 1). Because of the gynecomastia, follicle stimulat-ing hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone levels were obtained before and after operation. In addition urinary estro-gens, 17 -hydroxycorticosteroids (17 -OH) and 17 -ketosteroids (17 -KS) were measured post-operatively (Table I). Six months after removal of the tumor, the persistent elevation of urinary estrogens to pregnant levels prompted a thorough search for residual tumor but none was found. His hormone levels have returned to normal after two years...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a protocol for the identification of aberrant chromosome behavior during human male meiosis up to metaphase of the <b>secondary</b> <b>spermatocyte.</b> Histological evaluation by the Johnsen score of a testicular biopsy was combined with immunofluorescence of first meiotic prophase spermatocytes, using antibodies against synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SYCP 3) and {{the product of the}} ataxia telangiectasia and rad 3 -related gene (ATR). This combination enables accurate meiotic prophase substaging and the identification of pachytene spermatocytes with asynapsis. Furthermore, we also investigated the competence of late pachytene primary spermatocytes to complete the first meiotic division up to metaphase and of secondary spermatocytes to transform into metaphase by an in vitro challenge with okadaic acid (OA). We tested this protocol on five males with normal Johnsen scores that presented with obstructive azoospermia, five males with low Johnsen scores and non-obstructive azoospermia and six vasectomized control males of proven fertility and normal Johnsen scores. In all azoospermics, the profiling of meiotic prophase stages by immunofluorescence increases the resolving power of the Johnsen score. In both obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermic patients, relatively more leptotene meiotic prophase stages were counted compared to the controls. In non-obstructive azoospermics, a marked heterogeneity in spermatogenesis was found, after combining the results of all three approaches, pointing at functional mosaicism of the germinal epithelium. Asynaptic pachytene spermatocytes were rarely encountered. Also, when first meiotic metaphase could be induced by OA, chiasma counts were normal. In none of the non-obstructive azoospermic males did the pattern of spermatogenesis resemble that of knock-out mouse azoospermics. We conclude that this combined histological and cytological approach enables a detailed phenotypic classification of infertile males, at a level comparable to that applied for male-sterile knock-out mice with a meiotic defect. This may facilitate the identification of candidate genes for human male infertilit...|$|E

40|$|Gametogenesis is {{a highly}} complex process that {{requires}} stringent control of gene expression, in which translational regulation plays an essential role. Deleted in Azoospermia-like (DAZL) belongs to the DAZ family of RNA-binding proteins, which are restricted to germ cells, and regulate mRNA translation. Importantly, loss of function of these proteins results in infertility in {{both males and females}} {{in a wide variety of}} organisms. A model for the mechanism by which DAZL stimulates translation has been proposed based on work in Xenopus laevis (X. laevis) oocytes. In this model, DAZL functions by recruiting the translation initiation factor poly(A) -binding protein (PABP) to the 3 ’ untranslated region (UTR) of messenger RNAs. Simultaneous binding of PABP to Dazl and factors at the 5 ’ end confers a “closed-loop” mRNA conformation, which promotes translation initiation. To examine whether DAZL plays a similar role in mammals, co-expression of Dazl and PABP family members was investigated in fetal and adult mouse gonads. In contrast to X. laevis, mammals encode four cytoplasmic PABPs which share a similar domain organisation: PABP 1, tPABP, ePABP and PABP 4, of which PABP 1 and PABP 4 appear to be expressed in a wide range of tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed that Dazl, Pabp 1 and Pabp 4 are all expressed in primordial germ cells (PGCs) but these show different expression patterns following germ cell sex differentiation. In adult testes Dazl is expressed in spermatogonia and spermatocytes, coinciding with the peak of Pabp 4 expression. In contrast, the peak of Pabp 1 expression occurs later than that of Dazl, with these proteins only being co-expressed in late pachytene and <b>secondary</b> <b>spermatocyte</b> phases. In adult ovaries, Pabp 1, Pabp 4 and Dazl are all expressed in the oocytes of primordial and primary follicles. Since both PABP family members are co-expressed with Dazl, the ability of DAZL to interact with PABP 1 and PABP 4 was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, these studies showed that DAZL discriminates between different PABP family members, only interacting with PABP 1, providing the first report of a PABP-specific protein partner. Several putative DAZL mutations have been identified in patients with impaired fertility. Two of these mutations, I 37 A and R 115 G, are located in the RNA recognition motif (RRM), a domain which is found in many RNA-binding proteins and mediates both RNA and protein interactions. Thus, the role of these mutations in the ability of DAZL to stimulate translation was investigated. To this end, a translational target of human DAZL (hDAZL) was sought. The 3 ’UTR of growth differentiation factor 9 (hGDF 9) mRNA was found to confer regulation by hDAZL and thus the ability of mutant DAZLs to stimulate reporter mRNAs containing this 3 ’UTR was examined. This revealed that both mutations compromised the ability of hDAZL to stimulate hGDF 9 translation, suggesting a causative effect. These results were further confirmed in assays in which hDAZL is artificially tethered to mRNAs. The ability of mutant hDAZLs to stimulate translation in this assay was compromised suggesting that loss of function is, at least in part, due to impaired protein-protein interactions rather than altered RNA-binding. This work provides insights into the molecular mechanism by which DAZL stimulates the translation of specific mRNAs during mammalian gametogenesis and provides evidence that this function may play an important physiological role in human reproduction...|$|E

In the present study, low and high doses of Cadmium or Selenium on alternate days (for 28 days) did not effected weekly body weight of rats significantly while Cd+Se treatment caused significantly reduction in weekly body weight compared to control. Cadmium and Selenium treatments on alternate days, alone and in combination showed no significant effect on testicular weight at both dose levels. Present study found that testicular width and length was not affected by low dose of all treatments, but mean testicular width and length was significantly decreased in high dosed Cadmium and Cd+Se groups. In the present study, epididymis weight was not effected by Cadmium, Selenium and Cd+Se in both low and high dosed groups compared to control whereas epididymal length was not effected by any treatment in low dose group, but at high dose level individual treatment with Cadmium and Selenium caused significant reduction in epididymal length compared to control. In this investigation, at low dose level vas deferens weight and length was not affected by all the three treatments while vas deferens width was decreased by Cadmium treatment and other two treatments showed no effect on width of vas deferens at this dose level. In high dosed group, significant reduction was found in vas deferens weight and length by Cadmium, Selenium and Cd+Se treatments compared to control, while vas deferens width was decreased by Cadmium and Cd+Se treatment compared to control. Histological study of testicular sections showed that Cadmium alone and in combination caused irregular thickening of tunica and widening of interstitium in the present study, Leydig cell nuclear diameter was not effected by Cadmium treatment at low level, but significantly increased by Selenium and Cd+Se treatment compared to control. In high dosed group, micrometric analysis showed significant decrease in leydig cell nuclear diameter in Cadmium and Cd+Se treated group compared to control, while Selenium treatment caused no effect on this dose level on nuclear diameter of leydig cells. Sertoli cell nuclear diameter was significantly decreased by Cadmium treatment at low dose level compared to control, while Selenium and Cd+Se treatment showed no effect on Sertoli cell nuclear diameter at this dose level. In high dosed groups, reduction in Sertoli cell nuclear diameter was significantly caused by Cadmium and Cd+Se treatment compared to control. In the present investigation, nuclear diameter of spermatogonia was not effected by low dosed Cadmium, Selenium and Cd+Se groups, while at high dose, all the treatments caused highly significant decrease in nuclear diameter of spermatogonia. Nuclear diameter of primary spermatocyte was significantly decreased by Cadmium and Cd+Se treatment at both low and high dose level while, Selenium treatment did not influenced nuclear diameter of primary spermatocyte at low and high dosage. <b>Secondary</b> <b>spermatocyte</b> nuclear diameter was significantly reduced in both low and high dose groups with Cadmium, Selenium and Cd+Se treated groups. In present study, Cadmium, Selenium and Cd+Se treatment caused highly significant reduction in nuclear diameter of round spermatid at low dose level, but at high dose level no effect on nuclear diameter of round spermatids was found by Cadmium and Selenium individual treatments, while in Cd+Se treatment significant decrease in nuclear diameter of round spermatid was obvious. Daily sperm production and its efficiency was significantly reduced by the low and high dosed Cadmium and Selenium treated group compared to control. Coadministration of both chemicals at low dose level resulted in highly significant decrease in daily sperm production and its efficiency in rat, but at high dose level surprisingly co-exposure showed no significant effect on daily sperm production and its efficiency compared to control. This study demonstrates that Cadmium treatment at low and high dose resulted in significant decrease in mean serum cholesterol level. Individual treatment of Selenium caused significant elevation in serum cholesterol level in low dosed group while in high dosed treatment, no significant difference was observed compared to control. Cd+Se at both doses caused no significant effect on serum cholesterol level compared to control. Serum testosterone was significantly decreased by alone treatment of Cadmium and Selenium in both dosed group while, Cd+Se at low dose level caused no effect on serum testosterone concentration, while at high dose level Cd+Se treatment resulted in highly significant decrease in serum testosterone levels compared to control. Serum estradiole levels was significantly decreased in both low and high dosed groups by all treatments. In the present study, serum LHRH concentration was highly significantly increased by Cadmium and Cd+Se treatment in both low and high dosed groups compared to control, while Selenium treatment in both doses caused no effect on serum LHRH levels. Cadmium exposure at low dose level did not influenced mean serum level of LH significantly but at high dose mean serum LH level was decreased highly significantly. Selenium treatment in present experiment showed no alteration in mean serum LH level at low dose level but significant reduction in this gonadotropin serum level was noticed in high dose group. Cd+Se treatment at low dose level caused significant elevation in serum LH levels and significant decrease was noticed due to this treatment in high dosed group. In the current research, serum FSH level was not significantly effected by all three treatments in low dosed groups but in high dosed groups, serum FSH level was significantly decreased by Cadmium and Selenium individual treatments and no difference was observed in serum FSH level in Cd+Se treated group compared to control. In this investigation, epididymis caput and corpus tubule diameter was significantly decreased by Cadmium, Selenium and Cd+Se treatments compared to control in both low and high dosed groups. Cadmium, Selenium and Cd+Se treatments in high dosed groups caused significant increase in caput epithelial height compared to control. Epithelial height in corpus was significantly increased by all treatments in both low and high dosed experiments. In cauda epididymis, tubule diameter was decreased by Cadmium and Cd+Se treatment in both low and high dosed groups but individual treatment of Selenium resulted in significant increase in tubule diameter in both high and low dosed experiments. Epithelial height in cauda epididymis was significantly increased by individual treatment of Cadmium and decreased by Selenium while Cd+Se caused no effect compared to control in low dosed group. In high dosed group, Cadmium, Selenium and Cd+Se caused significant increase in cauda epithelial height compared to control. DNA status in epididymal sperm was analysed by single cell gell electrophosis. Comet length, comet height and head diameter was significantly increased by Cadmium, Selenium and Cd+Se treatment compared to control. %DNA in head, tail length, %DNA in tail, tail moment and olive moment were not effected by all the treatments at this dose level. In high dosed experiment, Cadmium treatment resulted in significant reduction in %DNA in head and significant increase in %DNA in tail, tail moment and olive moment. Selenium treatment at this dose level caused highly increased comet length, comet height, head diameter, tail length and decrease in olive moment compared to control. Cd+Se treatment resulted in significant increase in tail moment and reduction in olive moment compared to control. Concluding, at low dose level all treatments effected sperm DNA but the increase in comet length, comet height and head diameter by Selenium treatment was more pronounced. In high dosed group, highest effect of Cadmium treatment on %DNA in head, %DNA in tail, tail moment and olive moment was noticed. Vas deferens diameter and muscular thickness was significantly reduced by Cadmium, Selenium and Cd+Se treatments in both low and high dosed groups, whereas vas deferens epithelial height was increased by individual treatment of Cadmium and Selenium treatments in low dosed group. In high dosed group, epithelial height of vas deferens was increased by Cadmium and Cd+Se treatments compared to control. In the present study in both low and high dosed groups, dose dependent increase in Cadmium deposition was noticed in testes, epididymus and vas deferens of Cadmium and Cd+Se treated groups compared to control. In the present study, Selenium level was significantly increased in testes of Cadmium, Selenium and Cd+Se treated groups in low dose experiment, while high Selenium deposition was observed in testes of Cadmium and Selenium treated groups compared to control in high dose experiment with no effect in Cd+Se treated group in Selenium testicular levels at high dose level. However the highest deposition of Selenium was noticed in Selenium treated group of low dose experiment. In epididymis significantly high deposition of Selenium was noticed in Selenium and Cd+Se treated groups of low dose experiment whereas in high dose experiment significantly higher deposition of Selenium was obvious in epididymis of only Selenium treated group compared to control. Highest deposition was noticed in epididymis of high dosed Selenium group. Significantly high Selenium concentration was found in vas deferens of Selenium treated group at low dose level compared to control while in high dose experiment, significantly high levels of Selenium was deposited in Cadmium, Selenium and Cd+Se treated groups. Concluding, Cadmium act as reproductive toxicants in this study either given alone or in combination for 28 alternate days to adult rat. Cadmium treatments altered the function and structure of testes, epididymes and vas deferens adjusted through changed levels of serum gonadotrophins, estradioled and testosterone, eventually effecting the fertility status in male. This study also disclosed that both chemicals have toxic effects on sperm DNA integrity...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a start {{was made with}} meiotic {{observations}} of mouse translocation types - a Robertsonian translocation and a translocation between a metacentric and an acrocentric chromosome - which also occur in man. It is generally accepted that, when no chromosomal rearrangements are involved, man shows {{a higher level of}} non-disjunction than the mouse. When the meiotic behaviour of translocations in mouse and man would be more similar than that found for the autosomal bivalents (and sex bivalent) of these species Chapter 1 reviews the methodology to establish this difference mouse systems characterized by chromosome aberrations would become more attractive as models for the study of endogeneous and exogeneous factors on the meiotic process and extrapolation from mouse to man would be facilitated. As it appeared in these studies that not only the translocation complex but also the normal bivalents contribute to a significant extent to the non-disjunction rates in the heterozygote for a translocation of the meta/acro type, this material appeared even more favourable as an experimental substitute for man than was initially expected. Meiosis in male mice, heterozygous for the Robertsonian translocation Rb(11. 13) 4 Bnr, has been studied in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism(s) of non-disjunction for the trivalent formed at meiosis I by the Rb chromosome and the two acrocentric homologues 11 and 13 (Chapters 2 and 3). As an exogeneous factor of possible influence, the meiotic effects of two types of radiation, administered at relatively low doses 2 and 3 hours before prometaphase-metaphase II (probably during metaphase-anaphase I), were determined in Rb 4 Bnr/+-males (Chapter 3). The segregational behaviour of the multivalent at anaphase I has been compared in T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,RBnr, structurally homozygous for the metacentric Rb(11. 13) 4 Bnr chromosome whereby arm 13 of one of the two metacentrics is involved in a reciprocal translocation with the acrocentric chromosome 1, and T(I 113) 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr (Chapter 4). The multivalents formed by the latter karyotype at meiosis I are highly comparable to those of the former one; for details see section III below. The results obtained, and presented below, warrant a further investigation of these mouse meiotic systems as models for the situation in man as is for example indicated by the significant increase of normal bivalent non-disjunction found in the T(1; 11. 3 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr and the T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr karyotypes. In the next sections the chapters on which the conclusions are based, have been indicated between parentheses. I Indications for the relation between delay before and around anaphase I and non-disjunction in male Rb 4 Bnr Robertsonian translocation heterozygotes- For Rb 4 Bnr/+ males, inter mouse variation was noted with respect to the duration of the meiotic prophase, i. e. the period "end of the premeiotic S phase-metaphase V'. This was concluded {{on the basis of the}} frequency of late diplotene/metaphase I cells with labelled chromosomes recorded autoradiographically in mice killed various time intervals after the i. p. administered injection with 3 H-thymidine (3). - For Rb 4 Bnr/+ males, compared to their +/+ controls, a greater mean number of late diplotene/metaphase 1 cells was counted in the separate groups along the seminiferous epithelium, whereas the mean distance between the subsequent groups was smaller. As these data are in contradiction with the reduction by 58 % of the epidydimal sperm count for Rb 4 Bnr/+ compared to +/+, the greater number was thought to be an accumulation effect due to delay during diplotene/metaphase I for at least a fraction of the cells. Implicitly a causal relation between delay and cell death before the spermatozoal stage is also suggested (2). - The duration of the period "end meiosis I (metaphase I) - end meiosis II'' was approached autoradiographically for Rb 4 Bnr/+-males with the aid of cells showing a labelled Y chromosome only. The best assessment of the duration of this period was 3 hours or less. Inter mouse variation with respect to the duration of the period "end of the premeiotic S phase-metaphase ill (see above) prevented a more accurate estimate (3). - Irradiation of Rb 4 Bnr/+ males for 14. 5 minutes with a dose of 15. 2 rad fast neutrons (mean energy 1. 7 MeV) significantlydecreased the incidence of ancuploid secondary spermatocytes, scored 2 and 3 hours after application. This was explained by selective cell killing of those cells giving rise to aneuploid daughter cells after anaphase I, rather than by protection against non- disjunction by the irradiation dose, as follows: For Rb 4 Bnr/+ during the final period of the primary spermatocyte stage, cells show a continuous distribution with respect to the extent of delay. Cells with a strong delay will die off before the <b>secondary</b> <b>spermatocyte</b> stage, while the fraction showing only minor delay will survive (in the unirradiated situation) but with an increased risk of producing aneuploid daughter cells. The results suggest that, in terms of cell death, the victims of the 15. 2 rad neutron irradiation predominantly have to be searched in the last category. A causal relation between delay and ensuing non-disjunction at anaphase I, and between delay and the neutron irradiation effect respectively, is thus suggested but the basis for these interactions remains unknown (3). II Irradiation induced damage during meiosis in male Rb 4 Bnr Robertsonian translocation heterozygotes- After irradiation of Rb 4 Bnr/+ male mice for 14. 5 minutes with either a dose of 15. 2 rad neutrons or 60 rad X rays, only neutrons affected, viz. significantly decreased (see above), the incidence of aneuploid secondary spermatocytes estimated 2 and 3 hours after irradiation. The reason for this difference remained unknown and could not be explained on the basis of a difference in the levels of radiation induced damage. The two radiation types induced comparable levels of chromosome damage, i. e. numbers of breaks, fragments and deletions per cell, when compared in either late diplotene/metaphase I or metaphase II cells. For these parameters the neutrons: X ray RBE ratios estimated were 5. 4 for meiosis 1 and 3. 3 for meiosis II cells (3). - After an irradiation-fixation interval of 2 to 3 hours, the chromosome damage (i. e. numbers of breaks, fragments and deletions) induced by either 15. 2 rad neutrons or 60 rad X rays was 5 - 10 times higher when scored in metaphase II than in diakinesis/ metaphase I cells. At the moment of irradiation the two categories of cells were, most probably, at prometaphase/metaphase 1 and late diplotene/early diakinesis, respectively. The difference in chromosome damage was argued to be merely the consequence of differences in chromosomal processes taking place during the irradiation-fixation interval and not a reflection of a difference in radiation sensitivity between the two meiosis I stages (3). III The meiotic behaviour in T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr and T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr male mice, also with reference to the behaviour of the normal bivalentsThe T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr karyotype includes the metacentric Rb(11. 13) 4 Bnr chromosome in homozygous condition whereby the 13 arm of one of the metacentrics is involved in a reciprocal translocation with the acrocentric chromosome 1. The T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr karyotype is double heterozygous for the T(1; 13) 7 OH reciprocal translocation and the metacentric Rb(11. 13) 4 Bnr chromosome. Its multivalent at meiosis I differs from the one in the former karyotype in one respect: The (acrocentric) chromosome 11 is here involved once separately and once as one of the arms of the metacentric, i. e. attached to the 13 arm, whereas in the former karyotype the two chromosomes 11 are involved each in a metacentric. - For the short translocated segment 13 t, in both T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+, Rb 4 Bnr and T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr males, chiasma terminalization with proceeding meiosis I was observed less frequently compared with T 70 W+. It was argumented that this is probably due to spermatocyte I degeneration taking place to a higher extent in the former two karyotypes as in both, in comparison to T 7 OH/+, a greater frequency of meiosis 1 cells with short contracted bivalents was observed. The latter phenomenon was in an earlier study shown to correlate highly with a decreasing sperm count (4). - In T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+, Rb 4 Bnr a chiasmate association of the long interstitial segment 13 i was absent in 12. 5 % (N= 1000) of the meiosis I cells, but only in 2. 7 % (N= 1000) of these cells in T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr males. A cause for this discrepancy could not be given the phenomenon could not be contributed to a precocious "disappearance" of the 13 i chiasma - and seems to be an effect of the metacentric chromosome present in homozygous condition in the former karyotype (4). A significant increase of the 3 : 1 segregation of the multivalent chromosomes after anaphase 1 in comparison to T 7 OH/+ (3. 5 %) was found for T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr (10. 9 %) but most significantly for T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr (22. 6 %). In the latter karyotype this refers only to the four chromosomes involved in that part of the multivalent caused by the T 70 H translocation. In T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr, a preference of the small marker chromosome 1 13 to segregate; with the metacentric Rb 4 Bnr chromosome was indicated and this could be sustained by the high frequency of Ts(1 13 ) 70 H tertiary trisomics among the progeny of males of this karyotype. The results suggest that factors predisposing for 3 : 1 segregation and life expectancy of the tertiary trisomic product produced among the progeny may coincide (4). In T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr males the alternate and adjacent 1 segregation products could be distinguished at meiosis II and almost equal frequencies were found for both. In the offspring however, karyotypes resulting from adjacent 1 were found more frequently but this disagreement is probably due to the limited sample size of the offspring karyotyped (4). In both T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr and T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr male mice, the normal bivalent non-disjunction after anaphase I appeared to be highly elevated in comparison to +/+ and T 70 H/+ For the former karyotype a correlation was observed, moreover, between nondisjunction for the normal bivalents and adjacent 2 segregation of the multivalent chromosomes. This suggests either an interaction between the two phenomena or, alternatively, their coincidence may be an effect of the general (poor) physiological status of the cells. A sharp distinction between these alternatives cannot be made. The indication of spermatocyte I degeneration (see first point of this section) in both karyotypes puts weight on the latter hypothesis, assuming an interaction between the poorer physiological status of the cell and adjacent 2 /normal bivalent non-disjunction. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{chromatoid body}} (CB) {{is a unique}} {{structure}} of male germ cells composed of thin filaments that condense into a perinuclear organelle after meiosis. Due {{to the presence of}} proteins involved in different steps of RNA metabolism and of different classes of RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), the CB has been recently suggested to function as an RNA processing centre. Herein, we show that the RNA binding protein SAM 68 transiently localizes in the CB, in concomitance with the meiotic divisions of mouse spermatocytes. Precise staging of the seminiferous tubules and co-localization studies with MVH and MILI, two well recognized CB markers, documented that SAM 68 transiently associates with the CB in <b>secondary</b> <b>spermatocytes</b> and early round spermatids. Furthermore, although SAM 68 co-immunoprecipitated with MVH in <b>secondary</b> <b>spermatocytes,</b> its ablation did not affect the proper localization of MVH in the CB. On the other hand, ablation of the CB constitutive component MIWI did not impair association of SAM 68 with the CB. Isolation of CBs from Sam 68 wild type and knockout mouse testes and comparison of their protein content by mass spectrometry indicated that Sam 68 ablation did not cause overall alterations in the CB proteome. Lastly, we found that SAM 68 interacts with DROSHA and DICER in <b>secondary</b> <b>spermatocytes</b> and early round spermatids and that a subset of miRNAs were altered in Sam 68 (-/-) germ cells. These results suggest a novel role for SAM 68 in the miRNA pathway during spermatogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Alarge {{body of work}} {{indicates}} that chromosomes {{play a key role}} in the assembly of both acentrosomal and centrosome-containing spindles. In animal systems, the absence of chromosomes either prevents spindle formation or allows the assembly of a metaphase-like spindle that fails to evolve into an ana-telophase spindle. Here, we show that Drosophila <b>secondary</b> <b>spermatocytes</b> can assemble morphologically normal spindles in the absence of chromosomes. The Drosophila mutants fusolo and solofuso are severely defective in chromosome segregation and produce <b>secondary</b> <b>spermatocytes</b> that are devoid of chromosomes. The centrosomes of these anucleated cells form robust asters that give rise to bipolar spindles that undergo the same ana-telophase morphological transformations that characterize normal spindles. The cells containing chromosome-free spindles are also able to assemble regular cytokinetic structures and cleave normally. In addition, chromosome-free spindles normally accumulate the Aurora B kinase at their midzones. This suggests that the association of Aurora B with chromosomes is not a prerequisite for its accumulation at the central spindle, or for its function during cytokinesis...|$|R
