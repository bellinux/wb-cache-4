However, attention has recently shifted on identifying the regulatory molecules that “open ” and “close ” junctions, because this information will be useful in elucidating the mechanism of germ cell movement. For instance, cytokines have been shown to induce Sertoli cell tight junction disassembly by shutting down the production of tight junction proteins.

By electrical hybridization, a novel gene, Cymg 1 (GenBank accession No. AY 600990), {{which has a}} full length of 0. 78 kb, and contains four exons and three introns, was cloned from a mouse testis cDNA library. The gene {{is located in the}} 2 G 3 area of chromosome 2. The full cDNA encompasses the entire open reading frame, encoding 141 amino acid residues. The protein has a cysteine protease inhibitor domain that is related to the family 2 cystatins but lacks critical consensus sites important for cysteine protease inhibition. These characteristics are seen in the CRES subfamily, which are related to the family 2 cystatins and are expressed specifically in the male reproductive tract. CYMG 1 has a 44 % (48 / 108) identity with mouse CRES and 30 % (42 / 140) identity with mouse cystatin C.

Methods : To evaluate protective effect on doxorubicin(Doxo) -induced toxicity and enhancing {{effect on the}} antitumor activity of Doxo, CWG water extract(0. 5 ml) was intraperitoneally injected for 10 days, in combination with intraperitoneal injection of Doxo(4 mg/kg) on days 12, 16, 19, to mice subcutaneously inoculated with B 16 /F 10 melanoma cells. In order to investigate antitumor effect of CWG, CWG water extract(0. 5 ml) was intraperitoneally injected for 10 days to mice subcutaneously inoculated with B 16 /F 10 melanoma cells. Results : The body weights of melanoma-bearing mice increased following B 16 /F 10 cells inoculation. In contrast, such an increase in body weights was significantly attenuated by Doxo administration. Whereas CWG inhibits the decrease in body weights induced by Doxo. The tumor volume and tumor weights of melanomas-bearing mice dramatically increased following B 16 /F 10 cells inoculation, In contrast, such an increase in tumor volume and tumor weights were significantly attenuated by Doxo or CWG administration. But the synergic effect of CWG with Doxo was not observed.

40|$|Changes in the {{characteristics}} of spermatogenic and oogenic cells during gametogenesis may reflect a corresponding alteration in aspects of components such as calcium, which plays prominent roles in regulating {{a broad range of}} physiological events in animal reproduction. Basic information regarding distribution of intracellular calcium in different germ cells may provide better understanding of processes of reproduction in fish. The monthly testicular development in the cultured breeding stock of sterlet, Acipenser ruthenus, using histological and serum sex steroid was studied. Results showed four distinct phases including resting, pre-spawning, spawning and post-spawning. Hormonal profiles of 11 -ketotestosterone (11 -KT) showed peak, which indicated a seasonal pattern of gonadal development. The 11 -KT concentration increased considerably during the spermatogenesis (pre-spawning phase) and remained quite high throughout the pre-spermiation period. In the final phase of testicular development (spawning phase), the 11 -KT markedly dropped. This study provides basic knowledge of the reproductive biology in male sterlet and a complete guide for gonadal development, heretofore lacking in previous studies of sturgeon gonadal development. The intracellular distribution of calcium during different developmental stages of spermatogenesis was studied in sterlet, A. ruthenus, using a combined oxalate-pyroantimonate technique. The distribution of calcium was described in <b>spermatogonium,</b> spermatocyte, spermatid, and spermatozoon stages. Although calcium is appeared in the form of deposits in limited areas of the early stages cells (<b>spermatogonium</b> and spermatocyte), it is present as an unbound form in larger areas of spermatids and spermatozoa especially nucleus, which probably reflects changes in its physiological function and homeostasis of calcium during male gamete production. Similar to sterlet sturgeon, ultrastructural distribution of calcium during different developmental stages of spermatogenesis was described in a model organism, zebrafish (Danio rerio), using a combined oxalate-pyroantimonate technique. The subcellular distribution of intracellular calcium was detected as deposits mainly in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the <b>spermatogonium</b> and spermatocyte. Interestingly, large amount of calcium was transformed from isolated deposits into an unbound pool (electrondense mass) within the nucleus of the spermatid and the spermatozoon. The alteration of intracellular calcium at different stage of D. rerio spermatogenesis can be related to specific function of each germ cell types during male gamete development. Unbound calcium in the nucleus of mature spermatozoon can be used for condensation of chromatin and induction of calcium wave during egg activation and fertilization. Using a combined oxalate-pyroantimonate technique, the subcellular distribution of calcium deposits during stages of oogenesis in zebrafish was described. Calcium deposits were localized at different organells within the egg during oocyte development. At the first stage of oocyte development (primary growth), calcium deposits were localized in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, nucleus, and follicular cells. At the cortical-alveolus stage, calcium particles were transported from follicular cells into the cortical alveoli. In the main stage of oocyte development (vitellogenic stage), some cortical alveoli were compacted and transformed from flocculent electron-lucent to electron-dense objects with the progression of the stage. Calcium deposits were transformed from larger to smaller particles, coinciding with compaction of cortical alveoli. As a conclusion, results of this study provide new and convergent insight into information about the regulation and functional roles of calcium during fish gametogenesis which simply describe facilitate release of calcium from related organelles (nucleus and cortical alveoli) as main internal stores of calcium for calcium transport...|$|E

40|$|Protein 4. 1 G is a {{membrane}} skeletal protein {{found in}} specific subcellular structures in myelinated Schwann cells and seminiferous tubules. Here, {{we show that}} in the mouse sciatic nerve, protein 4. 1 G colocalized at Schmidt-Lanterman incisures (SLI) and the paranodes {{with a member of}} the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, membrane protein palmitoylated 6 (MPP 6). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that MPP 6 was interacting with protein 4. 1 G. In contrast to wild-type nerves, in 4. 1 G knockout mice, MPP 6 was found largely in the cytoplasm near Schwann cell nuclei, indicating an abnormal protein transport. Although the SLI remained in the 4. 1 G knockout sciatic nerves, as confirmed by E-cadherin immunostaining, their shape was altered in aged 4. 1 G knockout nerves compared to their shape in wild-type nerves. In the seminiferous tubules, MPP 6 was localized similarly to protein 4. 1 G along cell membranes of the <b>spermatogonium</b> and early spermatocytes. However, in contrast to myelinated peripheral nerves, the specific localization of MPP 6 in the seminiferous tubules was unaltered in the absence of protein 4. 1 G. These results indicate that 4. 1 G has a specific role in the targeting of MPP 6 to the SLI and the assembly of these subcellular structures...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{information}} {{with respect to}} spindle microtubules in serial sections of 3 cells at metaphase of the first meiotic division has been compiled and illustrated sufficiently to supple-ment the previous accounts with respect to both longitudinal and transverse views. At the equator the microtubules of the spindle are united laterally into bundles, the number of bundles being of the same order as that encountered at a premeiotic mitosis, though there is slight variation from cell to cell. The number of microtubules is greater than that at mitosis in a normal <b>spermatogonium,</b> though the distribution {{in different parts of}} the spindle is qualitatively similar. Stages of anaphase have been illustrated for the first time and shown to involve at least 3 types of physical forces mediating chromosome movements of various kinds. The later stages of cytokinesis have been timed and are illustrated from living cells and from sections. The relation of the spindle to the cord which unites the separating protoplasts towards the end of cytokinesis has been traced in outline. The cord itself is shown to contain micro-tubules in limited number and it is therefore not the whole spindle. The interpretation of these findings is discussed in a preliminary way...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To isolate and {{characterization}} of human spermatogonial {{stem cells from}} stem <b>spermatogonium.</b> Methods The disassociation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) were performed using enzymatic digestion of type I collagenase and trypsin. The SSCs were isolated by using Percoll density gradient centrifugation, followed by differential surface-attachment method. Octamer- 4 (OCT 4) -positive SSC cells were further identified using immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry technques. The purity of the human SSCs was also determined, and a co-culture system for SSCs and Sertoli cells was established. Results The cell viability was 91. 07 % for the suspension of human spermatogonial stem cells dissociated using a two-step enzymatic digestion process. The cells isolated from Percoll density gradient coupled with differential surface-attachement purification were OCT 4 positive, indicating the cells were human spermatogonial stem cells. The purity of isolated human spermatogonial stem cells was 86. 7 % as assessed by flow cytometry. The isolated SSCs were shown to form stable human spermatogonial stem cell colonies on the feeder layer of the Sertoli cells. Conclusions The two-step enzyme digestion (by type I collagenase and trypsin) process is an economical, simple and reproducible technique for isolating human spermatogonial stem cells. With little contamination and less cell damage, this method facilitates isolated human spermatogonial stem cells to form a stable cell colony on the supporting cell layer. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{germinal}} {{and somatic}} {{elements of the}} gonad are initially independent of one another and under separate genetic control mechanisms. They subsequently acquire {{a high degree of}} functional interdependence so that a defect in one cell type may have marked repercussions on the other. The behavior of the germ cell is determined in part by its genotype, and in part by the phenotypic environment in which it finds itself. Two X chromosomes are normally essential for oocyte formation, but an XX oocyte cannot survive in a testis. A Y chromosome seems to be essential in the <b>spermatogonium</b> if normal spermatozoa are to be produced. The somatic cells of the testis can develop normally and function as an endocrine organ {{in the absence of any}} germ cells and also apparently in the absence of a Y chromosome. However, the development of the graafian follicle, the endocrine apparatus of the ovary, is dependent on the presence of normal oocytes. A number of specific genetic loci have recently been discovered which regulate sex determination and differentiation. These include the autosomal dominant Sxr in the mouse, the autosomal recessive Polled in the goat, and the X-linked Tfm and the Y-linked histocompatibility antigen in a wide variety of species. At the moment, all the evidence points to these genes as regulators of somatic rather than germinal sex differentiation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
