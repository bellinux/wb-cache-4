40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the difference of}} behaviour between fully grouted bolts with and without free <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> when loaded in tension. An analytical approach is proposed for fully encapsulated bolts when the free end of the bolt slips. This model {{is based on the}} existing bond-slip relationship of bolt-grout interface with no free <b>end</b> <b>slip.</b> The derived analytical solutions of load-slip relationship, slip distribution, the shear stress and strain distributions presented in this paper are all connected with free <b>end</b> <b>slip.</b> The analytical approach is validated by experimental results. Free <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> has a significant influence on rock bolt behaviour and should not be ignored...|$|R
50|$|Having on both ends, {{an elbow}} {{of the end}} rather than the end itself, cross the knot center, gives a single or double slipped version. This results in a knot where the {{curvature}} carrying the most weight is around twice as thick a core (thus with less curvature, giving possibly a higher break strength), but also a bulkier knot. It is still easier to untie by pulling the opposing bridges {{away from each other}} rather than by pulling the <b>slipped</b> <b>end(s).</b>|$|R
30|$|The <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> is {{observed}} from {{early stage of}} loading and it is zero at initial loading. At the range of 75 % to 80 % of total loading capacity of composite slabs, the first crack appears. In {{the first group of}} shear span, the <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> up to the first crack appearance is gradually decreasing up to certain loading, and in the second group of shear span, the <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> up to the first crack appearance is suddenly dropping down up to certain loading. After that, the rate of <b>end</b> <b>slips</b> increases gradually up to the ultimate failure as shown in Figure 14. As provided in Table 1, the <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> at the ultimate load failure {{is observed}} between 2 to 3.6 mm. Curves depict gradual de-bonding of slab. Figures 15 and 16 show the differential movement of the concrete slab and steel deck for 300 - and 600 -mm shear span. At initial formation of cracks and at same loading point, rate of <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> is almost similar in all shear spans. Load-carrying capacity of composite slab decreased due to the load position moving towards the mid-span. Slip is observed from both sides of profile towards the center of slab.|$|R

50|$|The name of <b>Slip</b> <b>End</b> {{possibly}} has {{a connection}} with brickworks. Slip is an old English word for clay and End is a common part of place names in Bedfordshire and not unknown in other counties. End refers to small settlements outside larger villages. It is, therefore, possible that <b>Slip</b> <b>End</b> was named in the early 19th century {{because of the small}} number of houses built near the new brickworks in an area not previously developed with the older settlements of Woodside and Pepperstock to either side. Nearby Markyate has a Slype Lane which may or not be connected.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research project that investigated excessive strand <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> observed recently in some prestressed piles. From measurements taken in the field, it is apparent that the problem of excessive initial strand slip is independent of pile shape and size. Strand <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> is evident in piles of different manufacturers in different states in the Southeast. Excessive strand <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> was found in both {{the top and bottom of}} the cross section of the piles, although the top portion of the cross section generally exhibited much higher initial slip. Several preventive measures ran be adopted to reduce the excessive strand <b>end</b> <b>slip.</b> These preventive measures include: a) proper concrete mixture proportioning to reduce top bar effect; b) use of higher-strength concrete with the lowest possible slump and setting time; c) assessment of the condition of the strands prior to installation to insure excellent bond characteristics; d) gradual release of prestress, with an optimal release sequence; and e) use of adequate vibration to ensure consolidation. The strand <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> measured at five prestressing plants in the Southeast is considerably higher than the allowable <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> and is expected to affect the pile performance. If the strand slip theory is adopted the strand development length increases substantially die to the excessive strand <b>end</b> <b>slip.</b> A top bar effect factor similar to the one used in reinforced concrete design is recommended. To maintain the excellent quality of precast and prestressed concrete products, manufacturers should adopt a dynamic quality control process that follows the rapid changes in the industry. More tests are necessary to ensure excellent quality such as the Moustafa or an equivalent test, to assess the bond capabilities of the strands, <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> measurements. and direct measurement of the transfer length. Installation of piles should proceed in a manner to alleviate the top bar effects by placing piles alternately in their best and worst directions...|$|R

40|$|Bond-slip {{relationship}} of externally-bonded (EB) fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) joints {{can be determined}} by {{either directly or indirectly}} from a pull-off test. The indirect analytical method is gaining popularity and has been recommended in recent literature because of the more consistent and accurate results it yields. To date, loaded <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> vs applied load curve is used for indirect identification of the bond-slip relationship, ignoring the free <b>end</b> <b>slip.</b> This work shows that ignoring free <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> may result in significant errors in measuring the bond-slip relationship. The analytical method is used in this work to derive closed form solutions for FRP strain, interface slips, and bond strength of EB-FRP joints. The analytical solutions are validated by experimental results. Using the analytical solution, it is clearly shown in the paper that free <b>end</b> <b>slip</b> affects results and should be considered in deriving bond-slip {{relationship of}} EB-FRP joints, especially when bond length is short...|$|R
