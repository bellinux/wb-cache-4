40|$|The {{author of}} this {{document}} has chosen to explore the architectural area of adaptive reuse by converting an abandoned offshore oil drilling rig platform into a yacht club / conference facility. This document gives a general description of the facility's design precedents and major issues which were focused upon for this study, {{as well as a}} decsription of the final design for such facility. The location of the exisitng oil drilling rig is described in terms of location and numerous site conditions which effect the structure's design. This documen provides a basic description of how services and utilities are currently delivered to the remote site and ideas for delivering to the new facility. Designing a structure {{in the middle of the}} ocean requires a very different approach than most architects are accustomed to. This thesis book describes how the author educated himself to better understand the oceanic environment where offshore oil rigs are located.

50|$|By 1906, Sears, Roebuck and Co {{had opened}} their mail order and {{headquarters}} operation in a 3000000 sq ft building in Chicago, {{at the time}} the largest building in the world. The time and motion study, pioneered in manufacturing by F. W. Taylor and later applied to the office environment by Frank and Lillian Gilbreth, led to the idea that managers needed to play an active role in directing the work of subordinates in order to increase the efficiency of the workplace. F.W. Taylor advocated the use of large, open floor plans, and desks that faced supervisors. As a result, in 1915, the Equitable Life Insurance Company in New York City introduced the “Modern Efficiency Desk” with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers. This led to a demand for a large <b>square</b> <b>footages</b> per floor in buildings, and a return to the open spaces that were seen in pre-industrial revolution buildings.|$|R

40|$|In the United States, {{primary care}} {{has emerged as}} an {{increasingly}} effective alternative to costly inpatient emergency care and hospitalization. Thousands of outpatient community-based clinics have {{been built in the}} past decade, in rural, suburban and urban contexts. The majority focus on the provision of preventative and public health care for medically underserved and/or uninsured patient populations. As this facility type has flourished, there remains a paucity of empirical research on the architectural performance of these ambulatory care environments. In response, an empirical investigation was developed. A post-occupancy evaluation was conducted on five community health centers in Cincinnati, Ohio, all of which were located in urban settings. Among the findings, a set of planning and design provisions were articulated on issues centered on site planning, wayfinding, amenities, and the internal deployment of diagnostic and treatment functions, with the principal focus on the design of highly patent-centered care environments. The findings are discussed in relation to this healthcare building type and are likely of significant interest to primary care providers, architects, and allied design professionals, both in the US and internationally. An innovative feature and outcome of this project was the comparison of <b>square</b> <b>footages</b> of the 5 community health centers, divided by the number of annual patient encounters, number of staff, as well as energy consumption.

40|$|The typical {{suburban}} {{home is a}} "decorated box. " It is a prosaic rectangular mass "enhanced" by projected forms. The boxes within a typical suburban residential neighborhood line up along the streetfronts like soldiers standing shoulder to shoulder. These boxes remain in this configuration despite the many unique family types that make up these porchless communities. It is only when these families are economically capable, {{that they are able}} to take an interest in the way they are housed. This interest is typically manifested in the hiring of an architect to design a home that suits their individual family dynamics. It is often the architect that provides the homeowner with knowledge regarding sensibilities such as daylighting, capturing breezes and framing views. The architect empowers the homeowner by providing them with choice. As an experienced designer, the architect is able to provide the homeowner with a system or dialogue to direct the evolution of the design. It is the architect that asks the many questions that drive such things as <b>square</b> <b>footages,</b> materials, siting and adjacencies. This project explores the potential of a system that would bring a high level of design choices to the typical homeowner. This system was derived by reinterpreting the zones within the decorated boxes, both private and public. Reinterpreted as independent pavilions rather than an assortment of individual rooms arranged within a rigid box, an enhanced level of variability can be achieved. The "pavilion village" arrangement offers many opportunities to incorporate the design sensibilities that typical {{suburban home}}s are lacking. Most importantly, the homeowner is able to make choices regarding these sensibilites throughtout the process. This project tests this system with the design of two homes for two unique family types. The resulting designs of these two homes stemmed from the homeowner's decisions within this system. College of Architecture and PlanningTitle on CD-ROM: Variation through standardization. Thesis (B.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this design analysis is -to update the assessment of estimated annual secondary low-level waste (LLW) generation rates resulting from the repackaging of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level waste (HLW) for disposal at the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR). This analysis supports the preparation of documentation necessary for license application (LA) for the MGR. For {{the purposes of this}} analysis, secondary LLW is defined, in brief terms, as LLW generated {{as a direct result of}} processing SNF/HLW through the receiving and repackaging operations. The current Waste Handling Building (WHB) design is based on the predominant movement of fuel assemblies through the wet handling lines within the WHB. Dry handling lines are also included in the current WHB design to accommodate canistered waste (i. e., SNF and/or HLW packages). Major input changes to this analysis in comparison to previous analyses include: (1) changes in the SNF/HLW arrival schedules; (2) changes to the WHB and the Waste Treatment Building (WTB) dimensions; and (3) changes in operational staff sizes within the WHB and WTB. The rates generated in this analysis can be utilized to define necessary waste processes, waste flow rates, and equipment sizes for the processing of secondary LLW for proper disposal. This analysis is based on the present reference design, i. e., Viability Assessment (VA) design, and present projections on spent fuel delivery and processing. LLW generation rates, for both liquids and solids, are a direct function of <b>square</b> <b>footages</b> in radiological areas, and a direct function of spent fuel throughput. Future changes in the approved reference design or spent fuel throughput will directly impact the LLW generation rates defined in this analysis. Small amounts of wastes other than LLW may be generated on a non-routine basis. These wastes may include transuranic (TRU), hazardous, and mixed wastes. Although the {{objective of}} this analysis is to define LLW waste generation rates, this analysis does establish bounding estimates on hazardous and mixed waste generation rates for these two waste forms...|$|R

"This is the question I will try to prove through my thesis exploration, can architecture be created by concepts derived from organizational patterns found in music? Some people would argue yes while others would wholeheartedly so no. But, most individuals would agree that the similarities between architecture and music are numerous enough not to ignore them. My purpose for looking at architecture and music is more based ona personal interest in music. I enjoy music and felt this would be great way to learn about it. Not only does music act as the main catalyst for design, it is also the focus of the programmatic functions found in this thesis project, which is a music center. My interest in music prompted me to create a place where all types of musicians my come to record, all provided at a low cost. The center is composed of three recording studios, three live performance spaces, a music library, a sphere of music, and 32 apartments. The purpose of this center is to provide starving musicians the proper equipment and facilities to communicate to the largest possible audience their unique music. Hopefully the center will allow new musicians the ability to express new and creative ideas with out the pressure of selling out to make money. This center is allowing the artist a chance to keep their music honest, individual expression is expected here. To provide these services to the largest number of people possible Chicago, Illinois was chosen as the project site. The actual site is located at the corner of Halsted and Webster street north of the downtown area.

40|$|Coworking is {{a recent}} {{movement}} in workspaces, having developed as a formal working style around 2006. Coworking describes the act of sharing a physical workplace and office resources with {{other people who are}} not employees of the same company. It is an elective process, considered one of the many elements of the new sharing economy. Because coworkspaces allow members with very different backgrounds to come together and work in close proximity, they represent nodes within a community that can increase the social network ties of members. An increase in social network ties is linked to an increase in an individual's social capital. Having many individuals with robust social capital connections helps to build the overall resilience of a community. For this reason, coworkspaces represent an important opportunity for improving social capital and resilience. Many workplace studies examine the effects of worker satisfaction with setting on work activities, including collaboration and knowledge sharing. Because coworking is a relatively new phenomenon. Understanding the effects of spatial factors of the coworkspace on member satisfaction with the setting, and the collaborative activities that take place there, will lend new insight and allow for improvements on the design of coworkspaces. This thesis examines four coworkspaces in a single community (Ithaca, NY). User experience was measured through a survey measure of satisfaction with spatial factors and collaborative activity. The survey findings were enriched through ethnographic observations and one-on-one user interviews, to develop a better understanding of what elements in coworkspaces may lead to member satisfaction. Spatial factors investigated include openness, proximity to others, flexibility, privacy, distraction, and territoriality. Other factors emerged, during interviews, as meaningful to members, including artwork, presence of plants, daylight, and window views. Despite having different <b>square</b> <b>footages</b> and different design, the four sites have notable similarities. All four are in historic buildings in downtown Ithaca, NY. High windows are present in all four buildings, as are elements of historic architecture. Work zones are also similar; each site has two meeting rooms, a large open work area, and an area for food storage. Sites varied primarily in their aesthetics and decoration, their specific location within Ithaca, their size, and the emphasis of their membership marketing. Openness, variety of settings, and auditory distractions are found to be major spatial factors that contribute to changes in satisfaction with the collaborative environment in coworkspaces. The combination of one main open work area, two private workspaces, and options for workstation location and height contributed to member satisfaction with variety. Additionally, differences in satisfaction were apparent for staff members and based on gender, signifying that role and personal traits affect members' perception of the spaces and their experiences within...|$|R
