40|$|The {{economic}} viability of Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) {{as a means}} of mitigating CO 2 emissions is significantly dependent on the minimisation of costs associated with the compression and transportation of the captured CO 2. This paper describes the development and application of a rigorous thermodynamic model to compute and compare power requirements for various multistage compression strategies for CO 2 streams containing typical impurities originating from various capture technologies associated with industrial and power emission sectors. The compression options examined include conventional multistage integrally geared centrifugal <b>compressors,</b> <b>supersonic</b> shockwave <b>compressors</b> and multistage compression combined with subcritical liquefaction and pumping. The study shows that for all the compression options examined, the compression power reduces with the increase in the purity of the CO 2 stream, while the inter-stage cooling duty is predicted to be significantly higher than the compression power demand. For CO 2 streams carrying less than 5 % impurities, multistage compression combined with liquefaction and subsequent pumping from ca 62 bar pressure can offer higher efficiency than conventional gas-phase compression. In the case of a raw/dehumidified oxy-fuel CO 2 stream of ca 85 % purity, subcritical liquefaction at 62 bar pressure is shown to increase the cooling duty by ca 50 % as compared to pure CO 2...|$|R

40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} test program was {{conducted}} to acquire flow-field data during a <b>supersonic</b> propulsion system <b>compressor</b> stall and inlet unstart sequence. The propulsion system consisted of a mixed-compression, two-dimensional bifurcated inlet coupled to a General Electric J 85 - 13 turbojet engine. The propulsion system was mounted beneath a large flat plate that simulated an underwing propulsion pod installation. Transient flow-field pitot pressure and wing simulator surface static pressure data were acquired during multiple compressor stall and inlet unstart events at a free-stream Mach number of 2. 20. The experimental results obtained in this investigation indicate that a <b>supersonic</b> propulsion system <b>compressor</b> stall-inlet unstart transient event adversely affects the surrounding local flow field. The data show that the stall-unstart event affects the surrounding flow field on a millisecond time scale and causes a three-dimensional expanding wave front called a hammershock to propagate outward from the inlet.

40|$|Application of <b>supersonic</b> axial <b>compressor</b> stages is an {{effective}} way to decrease mass and volume of gas turbines. It is reported that stages with pressure ratio up to 2, 8 and blade velocity 450 m/s can operate quite satisfactory. There is demand for stages with pressure ratio that exceeds 3. 0. The possible efficiency of stages is vital for successful application. As a velocity coefficient at an impeller inlet of stages can be about 1. 5 and more, shock wave losses can limit overall stage efficiency. The simplified model of a stage was used for calculations. Supersonic flow in elementary blade cascade with sharp leading edges of blades produces oblique shock wave with sub – or supersonic flow after it. This depends on an inlet velocity coefficient and an angle between shock wave front and flow direction. The normal shock wave follows if a flow is still supersonic after an oblique shock. The known equations are used to calculate head losses in shock waves. Losses in a subsonic part of a stage are estimated by an arbitrary appointed loss coefficient. The calculations were made for a gas with = 1, 4 in a range of velocity coefficient = 1, 1 – 1, 8. Shock wave angle was varied in a range = 900 – ? 0, where ? 0 is an angle of a sonic wave. There were calculated static pressure ratios, static polytrophic efficiency, loss coefficient, velocity coefficients after shock waves. There are two zones of an operation: – subsonic flow after an oblique shock wave with angles bigger than 720 - 620 (the bigger value corresponds to a smaller velocity coefficient); – supersonic flow after an oblique shock wave with angles smaller than 720 - 620 and a normal shock wave after. An efficiency of a calculated stage model with subsonic flow after an oblique shock wave is not less 0, 88 when velocity coefficient is no more than 1, 6. The corresponding pressure ratio is about 4, 7. The problem is how far is the simplified model from a real 3 -D stage with all her complications. The system of an oblique and following normal shock waves transforms kinetic energy in a pressure rise formally most effective. An optimal angle of an oblique shock wave lies in a range = 550 - 450 (the bigger value corresponds to a smaller velocity coefficient); The efficiency is about 88 % for the velocity coefficient 1, 8 and = 450. There is a fantastic pressure ratio 11 ion this case. In can be concluded that for stages with pressure ratio about 3, 0 shock wave losses do not limit efficiency. The problem returns to trivial problems of preventing excessive separation after shock waves and to effective 3 -D design...|$|R
