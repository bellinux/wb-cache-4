5|$|Using the {{financing}} {{secured from the}} Merchant Adventurers, the Colonists bought provisions and obtained passage on two ships: the Mayflower and the <b>Speedwell.</b> They had intended to leave early in 1620, but they were delayed several months due to difficulties {{in dealing with the}} Merchant Adventurers, including several changes in plans for the voyage and in financing. The congregation and the other colonists finally boarded the <b>Speedwell</b> in July 1620 in the Dutch port of Delfshaven.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 1620 (Old Style date), {{the initial}} group of English Dissenters living in Leiden boarded the <b>Speedwell,</b> which {{was meant to}} {{accompany}} another ship to be hired in England. This initial group included the mostly Brownist congregation. Myles and Rose Standish were aboard, along with the Bradfords, Winslows, Carvers, and others. The small, 60-ton pinnace sailed to Southampton with about 30 passengers, to be provisioned there and join a much larger vessel for the voyage to the New World. Another 90 passengers would board the 180-ton Mayflower. The <b>Speedwell</b> had some significant leaks while in port that caused delays, but both vessels departed Southampton August 5.|$|E

50|$|This ancient {{woodland}} has {{a variety}} of flora such as oxlips and early-purple orchids in the spring and water avens and germander <b>speedwells</b> in the summer. Muntjac and roe deer use the site and birds include goldcrests, great spotted woodpeckers and tawny owls.|$|R
5|$|Bloomberg Businessweek ranked Dayton in 2010 {{as one of}} {{the best}} places in the U.S. for college {{graduates}} looking for a job. Companies such as Reynolds and Reynolds, CareSource, DPL, LexisNexis, Kettering Health Network, Premier Health Partners, and Standard Register have their headquarters in Dayton. It is also the former home of the <b>Speedwell</b> Motor Car Company, MeadWestvaco (formerly known as the Mead Paper Company), and NCR. NCR was headquartered in Dayton for over 125 years and was a major innovator in computer technology.|$|E
5|$|Richard was {{a sickly}} child and his parents' reduced {{circumstances}} meant that his education was somewhat sporadic. In {{his early years}} he wandered through the fields and brick yards where he lived, picking wildflowers. His favourites were Germander <b>Speedwell,</b> Creeping Tormentil and Common Chickweed. At {{the age of twelve}} he was apprenticed to a bat maker (the maker of children's small leather shoes) named James Heap, in Port Street, Manchester. About 18months later he went to work with James Hyde, with whom he stayed for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|The Atkins {{family moved}} {{frequently}} in his youth, eventually settling in Claiborne County, Tennessee. He attended {{high school at}} Powell Valley High in <b>Speedwell,</b> Tennessee. During high school, Atkins played guitar {{in his spare time}} at events and festivals. He went to college at Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville, Tennessee, where he made friends with songwriters and soon began writing himself. In the mid-1990s, Atkins moved to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue a recording career. He signed with Curb Records in 1996, the same week that LeAnn Rimes did.|$|E
25|$|Earlier, on 13 and 14 September, the {{garrison}} destroyed {{a number of}} floating batteries. In December 1784 there was a distribution of £30,000 in bounty money for the batteries and the {{proceeds of the sale}} of ships' stores, including those of San Miguel. A second payment of £16,000 followed in November 1785. A third payment, this of £8,000 pounds, followed in August 1786. June 1788 saw the payment of a fourth tranche, this of £4,000. <b>Speedwells</b> officers and crew shared in all four.|$|R

5|$|On {{the steep}} grassy slopes above the River Avon, Bristol rockcress (Arabis scabra) which {{is unique to}} the Avon Gorge can be seen {{flowering}} in April; orchids and western spiked <b>speedwell</b> (Veronica spicata) are common in June and July. In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi. Bilberry, a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the parasitic plant yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys). Lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley; there is doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. Green-flowered Helleborine (Epipactis phyllanthes) is found {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods.|$|E
5|$|The steep {{walls of}} the gorge support some rare fauna and flora, {{including}} species unique to the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol rock cress, Bristol onion, spiked <b>speedwell,</b> autumn squill and honewort. Because of its steep sides, there are {{many parts of the}} gorge on which trees cannot grow, making way for smaller plants. The gorge is also home to rare invertebrate species. The gorge has a microclimate around 1 degree warmer than the surrounding land. The steep south-west facing sides receive the afternoon sunlight, but are partially sheltered from the prevailing winds. When winds come from the Bristol Channel in the north west they may be funnelled into the gorge, creating harsh and wet conditions.|$|E
5|$|Green-flowered helleborine {{is found}} {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods. lady orchid was {{discovered}} here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley {{on the west side of}} the Gorge; there is some doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. fly orchid and bee orchid are found in the gorge, along with their hybrid. A single plant of lesser meadow-rue is present in the gorge. Bristol rock-cress occurs here, and at nearby Penpole Point; in the gorge, there are about 3,000 plants on the Bristol side, and about 2,000 below Leigh Woods. Hutchinsia is found on both sides of the gorge. Bloody crane's-bill grows on the Bristol side of the gorge, where it is believed to be native. Little robin occurs on both sides of the gorge. Spiked <b>speedwell</b> grows on both sides of the gorge: the first British record of this plant was from the gorge, in 1641.|$|E
40|$|<b>Speedwells</b> (Veronica spp.) are {{notable for}} their graceful and {{bountiful}} flowers, {{as well as}} their reliable nature. These long-blooming, easy-care perennials offer a range of plant types with a distinct verticality prized by gardeners. Throughout spring and summer their spiky flowers rise like sentinels in the sunny garden. Whether at the front, middle, or back of the border, their slender wands enliven the garden with color and the busy-ness of butterflies and bees. Their popularity has only increased in recent years due to the introduction of many hybrid cultivars with new flower colors and improved plant forms. Veronica, known commonly as speedwel...|$|R
5000|$|Susanna {{retained}} {{her figure}} and complexion until her death, supposedly because she never used paint or cosmetics and daily washed {{her face with}} sow's milk and drank it, recommending this treatment to others. Her eyes colour however went from the blue of forget-me-not to the light blue of <b>speedwells.</b> She once said to her daughter, Lady Bettie - What would you give to be as pretty as I am? To which Lady Bettie replied - Not {{half as much as}} you would give to be as young as I am. Cummell in her lifetime recorded that her complexion was like rhododendron and rose flowers dipped in milk. her daughter Helen once commented Who can surpass Mama? She has not aged a day in [...] years. It was believed that Susanna had discovered the secret of eternal youth, showing no signs of her beauty lessening even at the age of sixty.|$|R
60|$|Above his brother's house, whose sloping garden {{ran down}} to the railway line and river, a large room had been built out apart. Pierson stood where the avenue forked, enjoying {{the sound of the}} waltz, and the cool {{whipping}} of the breeze in the sycamores and birches. A man of fifty, with a sense of beauty, born and bred in the country, suffers fearfully from nostalgia during a long unbroken spell of London; so that his afternoon in the old Abbey had been almost holy. He had let his senses sink into the sunlit greenery of the towering woods opposite; he had watched the spiders and the little shining beetles, the flycatchers, and sparrows in the ivy; touched the mosses and the lichens; looked the <b>speedwells</b> in the eye; dreamed of he knew not what. A hawk had been wheeling up there above the woods, and he had been up there with it in the blue. He had taken a real spiritual bath, and washed the dusty fret of London off his soul.|$|R
5|$|U.S. Route 202 {{crosses the}} Passaic River into Harding Township, Morris County, where the route becomes Mt. Kemble Avenue. The NJDOT {{replaced}} this bridge {{with a new}} bridge built in seven days during August 2012. The new bridge was designed by AmerCom Corporation and built by Joseph M. Sanzari, Inc. utilizing Accelerated Bridge Construction techniques. In Harding Township, the road runs north through mostly runs through wooded residential and commercial areas, closely paralleling Interstate 287, which runs {{to the east of}} U.S. Route 202. It heads into more heavily wooded areas, running to the east of Morristown National Historical Park, before continuing northeast into Morris Township. Here, U.S. Route 202 continues through woodland, but residences start to increase along the road and it passes by an industrial facility. It passes by the Spring Brook Country Club before crossing into Morristown. Upon entering Morristown, the route heads toward the downtown area, where it splits into a one-way pair following Market Street northbound and Bank Street southbound. The one-way pair comes to Park Place, a square in the center of Morristown, where U.S. Route 202 meets County Route 510 and Route 124. County Route 510 heads west from the square on Washington Street and east from the square on Morris Street, while Route 124 heads east from the square on South Street. Meanwhile, U.S. Route 202 continues north from Park Place on <b>Speedwell</b> Avenue, a two-lane road that heads past numerous downtown businesses. The route then leaves the downtown area, heading through residential neighborhoods and crossing the Whippany River before leaving Morristown and crossing back into Morris Township, where it briefly passes through an area of businesses. At the intersection with County Route 650 (Hanover Avenue), U.S. Route 202 crosses into Morris Plains, where it continues north through suburban commercial and residential areas. The route passes under New Jersey Transit’s Morristown Line near the Morris Plains Station and intersects the southern terminus of Route 53 (Tabor Road).|$|E
25|$|In October Lieutenant George Brissac recommissioned <b>Speedwell</b> for the Channel. In May 1790 <b>Speedwell</b> {{was again}} recommissioned this time under Lieutenant George Paris Monke. <b>Speedwell</b> {{performed}} various missions for Admiral Lord Howe. Then in 1782, she {{was off the}} Yorkshire coast when she captured a smuggling brig. At 14 guns, the Hell-Afloat was probably as strongly armed as <b>Speedwell,</b> but did not resist capture.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant John Gibson {{commissioned}} <b>Speedwell</b> in July 1780, for the Mediterranean. She {{arrived at}} Gibraltar, which was undergoing the Great Siege, on 20 December, carrying dispatches. While <b>Speedwell</b> {{was on her}} way she encountered a small vessel that launched an attack that <b>Speedwell</b> repulsed, though Gibson sustained some wounds. On 1 January 1781 the British took possession of an abandoned settee on which there were letters, with one mentioning that the vessel that had attacked <b>Speedwell</b> had suffered several men killed and wounded.|$|E
60|$|The first Maryland {{regiment}} {{which was}} on the right wing, was attacked by Colonel Webster, with the British left. It stood the shock bravely, and being seconded by some Virginia troops, and Kirkwood's Delawares, drove Webster across a ravine. The second Maryland regiment was not so successful. Impetuously attacked by Colonel Stewart, with a battalion of the guards and a company of grenadiers, it faltered, gave way and fled, abandoning two field-pieces, which were seized by the enemy. Stewart was pursuing, when the first regiment which had driven Webster across the ravine, came to the rescue with fixed bayonets, while Colonel Washington spurred up with his cavalry. The fight now was fierce and bloody. Stewart was slain; the two field-pieces were retaken, and the enemy in their turn gave way and were pursued with slaughter; a destructive fire of grape-shot from the enemy's artillery checked the pursuit. Two regiments approached on the right and left; Webster recrossed the ravine and fell upon Kirkwood's Delawares. There was intrepid fighting {{in different parts of the}} field; but Greene saw that the day was lost; there was no retrieving the effect produced by the first flight of the North Carolinians. Unwilling to risk the utter destruction of his army, he directed a retreat, which was made in good order, but they had to leave their artillery on the field, most of the horses having been killed. About three miles from the field of action he made a halt to collect stragglers, and then continued on to the place of rendezvous at <b>Speedwell's</b> Iron Works on Troublesome Creek. The British were too much cut up and fatigued to follow up their victory. Two regiments, with Tarleton's cavalry, attempted a pursuit, but were called back.|$|R
25|$|<b>Speedwell</b> was re-rated as a sloop-of-war on 22 March 1782, {{with the}} news {{reaching}} Gibraltar on 22 May. On 16–17 September <b>Speedwell</b> prepared to go to sea.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of 22–23 August 1796, the French {{privateer}} cutter Brave approached <b>Speedwell</b> off St Catherine's Point on the Isle of Wight and attempted to board her. <b>Speedwell</b> captured Brave, which was armed with one 6-pounder guns and two swivel guns, and had a crew of 25 men. Brave was only 12 hours out of Cherbourg and had not yet captured anything. <b>Speedwell</b> carried Brave into Spithead.|$|E
25|$|<b>Speedwell</b> then {{remained}} at Gibraltar. Five men deserted <b>Speedwell</b> on 11 April after helping tow the cutter Tartar {{out of the}} Mole. On 16 June 1781 <b>Speedwell</b> brought 120 prisoners into Gibraltar, {{but it is not}} clear from where. On 5 October some of Speedwells crew intended a mutiny to seize her and desert with her to the Spanish. However, a Spanish boy, a deserter, who was on board informed Gibson, who arrested four ringleaders. The deserters were then placed in irons on the provost ship. About half the crew were amenable to the planned mutiny, which had the mutineers rising, killing the officers, and then sailing <b>Speedwell</b> to Algerciras. There the mutineers intended to sell her, split the proceeds, and proceed individually to England.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{before the}} start of the war with France, Monke sailed <b>Speedwell</b> to Hamburg to {{retrieve}} some British sailors rescued from various vessels that had wrecked on the coast of Jutland. He brought back about 100. Monke was forced to stay on deck day and night, although on the way back to Britain the weather was bad, to forestall any uprising by the rescued sailors. The fear was that the sailors, who were not anxious to be pressed into the Royal Navy, would try to seize <b>Speedwell</b> and run her ashore.|$|E
