40|$|Service tree (Sorbus domestica L.) {{is almost}} unknown in Denmark, {{but may be}} {{interesting}} in a future warmer climate. The paper includes {{an introduction to the}} species' ecology, diseases, cultivation and products. Service tree has a number of good properties, but can be difficult to establish. It is recommended only to plant service tree on a small scale, until effective means against <b>stem</b> <b>cankers</b> have been identified. On the suitability of service tree for silviculture in Denmark: Service tree is drought tolerant and thrives well in a climate that is slightly warmer than at present in Denmark. However, service tree can be somewhat difficult to establish and young trees are prone to <b>stem</b> <b>cankers</b> that may potentially kill the tree. In 2002 we planted some service trees of unknown origin in northern Denmark. They were planted in different types of already established, mixed forest stands. The area had previously been stocked with an apple orchard. The rate of survival was high although none of the trees were sprayed with sulphur or copper. Now, all the service trees suffer more or less from <b>stem</b> <b>cankers</b> and most of them do not thrive well. In 2013 we raised some seedlings of Modra origin (Figure 1). Almost all seeds germinated, and the seedlings grew 34 ‐ 92 cm tall in the first growing season (average height = 57 cm). We consequently consider it easy to produce nursery plants. So far, our experience is insufficient to judge the long‐term prospects for service tree as a forest crop tree in Denmark. However, old and large trees in good growth and without diseases testify that service tree can thrive and remain healthy. In a coming article we will present an overview of some of the trees that we know. In our opinion, the fruits and the spectacularly beautiful autumn foliage are sufficient reasons for planting some service trees in the forest. We recommend small‐scale plantings until effective means against <b>stem</b> <b>cankers</b> have been identified...|$|R
50|$|Symptoms of {{the disease}} include dying {{branches}} and <b>stems.</b> Initially, <b>cankers</b> develop on branches in the lower crown. Spores developing on these dying branches are spread by rainwater to tree <b>stems.</b> <b>Stem</b> <b>cankers</b> develop 1 to 3 years after branches die. Tree tops killed by stem-girdling cankers do not resprout. Diseased trees usually die within several years. Completely free-standing trees seem better able to withstand the fungus than those growing in dense stands or forest. In some areas, 90% of the butternut trees have been killed. The disease {{is reported to have}} eliminated butternut from North and South Carolina. The disease is also reported to be spreading rapidly in Wisconsin. By contrast, black walnut seems to be resistant to the disease.|$|R

In the in vivo assays, metalaxyl, applied as soil drench at 2 g/tree, was the most effective, reducing growth of P. cactorum and P. citrophthora. Fosetyl-Al was less effective against both pathogens, while cymoxanil and dimethomorph did not inhibit growth. When scraped <b>stem</b> <b>cankers</b> were painted with metalaxyl, fosetyl-Al or dimethomorpth at 150 g/l Phytophthora colonization was inhibited, but cymoxanil applied {{in the same way}} was ineffective. In the in vitro tests, metalaxyl and dimethomorph at concentrations as low as 100 mg l- 1 completely inhibited growth of P. cactorum and P. citrophthora.

50|$|Disease {{identification}} is facilitated by observation of fruiting structures. Perithecia are found on cortical tissues and will produce globular to sub-cylindrical asci with two-celled ascospores. Interestingly, {{it has been}} observed that isolates from <b>stem</b> <b>canker</b> in the United States will readily form perithecia when grown in culture, but those from Europe will not. This suggests that there may be several species or biotypes of Phomopsis that cause <b>stem</b> <b>canker</b> worldwide. Pycnidia, the asexual fruiting bodies, can be detected on the stem and leaf lesions throughout the disease cycle. They are embedded in the tissue, dark brown and globular. The conidia come in two types, but the most common is beta conidia that are threadlike, hyaline and can be curled or straight.|$|E
40|$|Infection of canola (Brassica napus) by pycnidiospores of the {{blackleg}} fungus (Leptosphaeria maculans) {{and subsequent}} development of leaf and stem infection {{were influenced by}} temperature, wetness period and inoculum concentration. On cv. Hyola 42, as temperature decreased the latent period for leaf infection increased exponentially. The greatest number of leaf lesions developed on plants exposed to a day/night temperature of 18 / 15 °C with a 96 h wetness period. Incidence of stem infection was greatest at 23 / 20 °C with a 48 – 72 h wetness period, whereas no stem infection occurred 42 days after inoculation when plants were incubated at 8 / 6 °C.

40|$|Botrytis cinerea, {{the causal}} agent of grey mould, is {{considered}} as a major burden on greenhouse tomato production. In heated greenhouses, where leaf pruning is a routine practice and microclimatic conditions are favourable for grey mould development, infections of the pruning wounds result in <b>stem</b> <b>cankers</b> that can rapidly kill the plants. Chemical control is not always sufficiently effective and growers face increasing demands for reducing their dependency on pesticides. Several techniques {{can be used for}} the removal of leaves. They differ mainly on the presence or absence and the size of petiole stubs remaining on the stems after pruning. In this study, leaf pruning techniques were compared in an experimental greenhouse and the results validated in four commercial greenhouses, in a variety of agronomic conditions and in various situations of inoculum pressure. All experiments clearly showed that a careful removal of the leaves without leaving any petiole stubs on the stems can significantly decrease the incidence of <b>stem</b> <b>cankers</b> even under high disease pressure. As up to 10 -fold differences were observed, this suggests the possibility of improving pruning practices in tomato greenhouses by removing leaves systematically close to the stem.
