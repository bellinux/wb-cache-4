The Issei women lived lives of transition which were affected by three common factors: the dominant ideology of late Meiji Japan, which advanced the economic objectives of the Japanese state; the patriarchal traditions of the agricultural village, which arose partly as a form of adjustment to national objectives and the adjustment to changes imposed by modernization; and the constraints which arose within a Canadian or American society dominated by racist ideology. <b>Substantive</b> <b>evidence</b> of the working lives of Issei women is very difficult to find, partly for lack of data and partly because the data that do exist are influenced by their implicit ideological definition of women.|$|E

However, others, including Daphne du Maurier in her biography of Bacon, have argued {{that there is no}} <b>substantive</b> <b>evidence</b> to support claims of involvement with the Rosicrucians. Frances Yates does not make the claim that Bacon was a Rosicrucian, but presents evidence that he was nevertheless involved in some of the more closed intellectual movements of his day. She argues that Bacon's movement for the advancement of learning was closely connected with the German Rosicrucian movement, while Bacon's New Atlantis portrays a land ruled by Rosicrucians. He apparently saw his own movement for the advancement of learning to be in conformity with Rosicrucian ideals.|$|E

25|$|Business records exception: {{business}} records created during the {{ordinary course of business}} are considered reliable and {{can usually be}} brought in under this exception if the proper foundation is laid when the records are introduced into evidence. Depending on which jurisdiction the case is in, either the records custodian or someone with knowledge of the records must lay a foundation for the records, however. The use of police records, especially as <b>substantive</b> <b>evidence</b> against the accused in a criminal trial, is severely restricted under the Business Records exception. Typically, only generalized evidence about police procedure is admissible under this exception, and not facts about a specific case. For example, John is stopped for speeding 70 miles per hour in a 50-mile-per-hour zone. The officer, who determined John's speed with radar, records the speed in an incident report. He also calibrates and runs a diagnostic on his radar every day prior to beginning his shift. He records this in a log. At trial, the report itself would not be admissible as it pertained to the facts of the case. However, the officer's daily log in which he records his calibration and the daily diagnostics of his radar unit would be admissible under the {{business records}} exception.|$|E
25|$|In 1868, Butler was {{selected}} {{to be one of}} the managers of the impeachment of President Johnson before the Senate. Although Thaddeus Stevens was the principal guiding force behind the impeachment effort, he was aging and ill at the time, and Butler stepped in to become the main organizing force in the prosecution. The case was focused primarily on Johnson's removal of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office Act, and was weak because the constitutionality of the law had not been decided. The trial was a somewhat uncomfortable affair, in part because the weather was hot and humid, and the chamber was packed. The prosecution's case was a humdrum recitation of facts already widely known, and it was attacked by the defense's William Evarts, who drowned the proceedings by repeatedly objecting to Butler's questions, often necessitating a vote by the Senate on whether or not to allow the question. Johnson's defense focused on the point that his removal of Stanton fell within the bounds of the Tenure of Office Act. Despite some missteps by the defense, and Butler's vigorous cross-examination of defense witnesses, the impeachment failed by a single vote. In the interval between the trial and the Senate vote, Butler searched without success for <b>substantive</b> <b>evidence</b> that Johnson operatives were working to bribe undecided Senators. After acquittal on the first article voted on, Senate Republicans voted to adjourn for ten days, seeking time to possibly change the outcome on the remaining articles. During this time, Butler established a House committee to investigate the possibility that four of the seven Republican Senators who voted for acquittal had been improperly influenced in their votes. He uncovered some evidence that promises of patronage had been made and that money may have changed hands but was unable to decisively link these actions to any specific Senator.|$|E

40|$|This paper critiques the {{position}} of researchers and theorists who have called for greater recognition of a spiritual dimension in sport, an integration of spiritual dimensions into existing sport-related models, and applications in sport psychology consultancy (Udermann, 2000; Watson & Nesti, 2005). Definitions of spirituality {{and the relationship between}} spirituality and religion are discussed. Comparisons are made between past research using traditional and non traditional methods of enquiry. It is argued that the dominant approaches of most sports psychology consultants (promoting self-regulation and internal control) are diametrically opposed to spiritual practices where faith is placed outside of the self. Given the lack of <b>substantive</b> empirical <b>evidence,</b> it is concluded that calls for greater integration of a spiritual dimension in sport are somewhat premature, and potentially troublesome, although consultants should be sensitive to individuals’ belief systems in order to promote a productive working alliance...|$|R

This study examines the presence of IB during the performance of substantive testing and proposes two distinct interventions. Each intervention is predicted to improve auditor fraud detection. In a scenario involving fraudulent revenue transactions, findings show that a slight modification to the standard audit procedures significantly improves an auditor’s detection of red flags indicative of fraud. A second intervention involving the performance of a strategic reasoning task did not yield significant results. Overall, the results suggest that audit firms should consider making a cost effective adjustment to their standard audit program to improve fraud detection...|$|R
500|$|Much of Brant's {{influence}} {{came from}} her connections to Sir William Johnson and her stepfather Brant Kanagaradunkwa.

500|$|A chapel at Dunnottar {{is said to}} {{have been}} founded by St Ninian in the 5th century, {{although}} it is not clear when the site was first fortified, but in any case the legend is late and highly implausible. Possibly the earliest written reference to the site is found in the Annals of Ulster which record two sieges of [...] "Dún Foither" [...] in 681 and 694. The earlier event has been interpreted as an attack by Brude, the Pictish king of Fortriu, to extend his power over the north-east coast of Scotland. The Scottish Chronicle records that King Domnall II, the first ruler to be called rí Alban (King of Alba), was killed at Dunnottar during an attack by Vikings in 900. King Aethelstan of Wessex led a force into Scotland in 934, and raided as far north as Dunnottar according to the account of Symeon of Durham. W. D. Simpson speculated that a motte might lie under the present caste, but excavations in the 1980s failed to uncover <b>substantive</b> <b>evidence</b> of early medieval fortification. The discovery of a group of Pictish stones at Dunnicaer, a nearby sea stack, has prompted speculation that [...] "Dún Foither" [...] was actually located on the adjacent headland of Bowduns, [...] to the north.|$|E
500|$|Isolated and disowned {{by most of}} his family, Wills had become, in {{the words}} of cricket {{historian}} David Frith, [...] "a complete and dangerous and apparently incurable alcoholic". An oft-repeated story that Wills was housed at Kew Lunatic Asylum {{near the end of his}} life is not supported by <b>substantive</b> <b>evidence.</b> He and Barbor abruptly stopped drinking on 28 April 1880; it is presumed that they ran out of money to buy more alcohol. Two days later, Wills started to show signs of alcohol withdrawal, and Barbor, fearing that a calamity was at hand, admitted him to the Melbourne Hospital on 1 May to be kept under restraint. His physician treated him for delirium tremens, but he absconded soon after, returned home and the next day, in the grip of paranoid delusions, committed suicide by stabbing a pair of scissors into his heart three times. The inquest, on 3 May, presided over by coroner Richard Youl, found that Wills [...] "killed himself when of unsound mind from excessive drinking". Wills was buried the next day in an unmarked grave in Heidelberg Cemetery at a private funeral attended by only six people: his brother Egbert, sister Emily and cousin Harrison; Harrison's sister Adela and her son Amos; and cricketer Verney Cameron. His death certificate declared that his parents were unknown. When asked by a journalist about her late son, Elizabeth Wills is reported to have denied that Tom ever existed.|$|E
50|$|Proposals {{regarding}} its heritage {{prior to}} inscription in the Exeter codex are consequently many and various. The {{inclusion of a}} refrain {{in the text of}} the poem may support an originally non-English origin, as the refrain is not conventional to the Old English elegy or to any other known Old English poetical form. Among proposed explanations for this anomaly, a Scandinavian inspiration for the Anglo-Saxon text offers one possible solution to this problem, and has similarly been considered as an explanation for its difficult language, but this theory, as with most others on the poem's prehistory, can only be regarded as hypothetical given lack of <b>substantive</b> corroborating <b>evidence.</b> The suggestion is that the poem derives from some interpretation of the Wayland story; that the woman is Beadohilde, Wulf is Wayland, and Eadwacer her angry father.

2500|$|The Massiah rule {{is also to}} be {{contrasted with}} the voluntariness {{standard}} of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The voluntariness standard applies to all police interrogations regardless of the custodial status of the suspect and {{regardless of whether the}} suspect has been formally charged. The remedy for a violation of the standard is complete suppression of the statement and any evidence derived from the statement. The statement cannot be used as either <b>substantive</b> <b>evidence</b> of guilt or to impeach the defendant's testimony. The reason for the strictness is the common law's aversion to the use of coerced confessions because of their inherent unreliability. Further the rights to be free from coerced confession cannot be waived nor is it necessary that the victim of coercive police conduct assert his right. In considering the voluntariness standard one must consider the Supreme Court's decision in Colorado v. Connelly. Although federal courts' application of the Connelly rule has been inconsistent and state courts have often failed to appreciate the consequences of the case, Connelly clearly marked a significant change in the application of the voluntariness standard. Before Connelly the test was whether the confession was voluntary considering the totality of the circumstances. [...] "Voluntary" [...] carried its everyday meaning - the confession had to be a product of the exercise of the defendant's free will rather than police coercion. After Connelly the totality of circumstances test is not even triggered unless the defendant can show coercive police conduct. Questions of free will and rational decision making are irrelevant to a due process claim unless police misconduct existed and a causal connection can be shown between the misconduct and the confession.|$|E

[...] He appointed a three-member panel, consisting of Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, MIT President Dr. Samuel W. Stratton, and retired Probate Judge Robert Grant to conduct a complete review {{of the case and}} determine if the trials were fair. The committee reported that no new trial was called for and based on that assessment Governor Fuller refused to delay their executions or grant clemency. On May 10, 1927, while Fuller was considering requests for clemency, a package bomb addressed to him was intercepted in the Boston post office. A few months after the executions, he endorsed proposals to reform the state's judicial procedures to require a more thorough review of capital cases. [...] The episode led to Fuller being characterized in the international press as provincial, and the controversy surrounding the cases and criticism of his handling of it (which was widely seen to exacerbate rather than diminish political tensions) effectively ended his hopes for higher office. [...] New York Times reporter Louis Stark repeated a widely held belief that Fuller's decision to deny clemency was motivated by a desire to succeed Calvin Coolidge in the presidency, but there is no <b>substantive</b> <b>evidence</b> to corroborate this idea, beyond the coincident timing of Coolidge's announced decision not run in 1928 and Fuller's decision.

While research into the relationship between emotions and sport performance is a well established field of study, the emergence of the construct emotional intelligence has opened up a new research focus and addition to the literature. However, despite the increasingly widespread view that emotional intelligence may be linked to sports performance, currently few empirical research studies have been undertaken, and thus there is a paucity of <b>substantive</b> scientific <b>evidence</b> to support this contention.
