40|$|The start-transition (START) in the G 1 phase {{marks the}} point in the cell cycle at which a yeast cell initiates a new round of cell division.

How commitment emerges from the underlying molecular interaction network is poorly understood. Here, we perform a dynamical systems analysis of an established cell cycle model, which has never been analysed from a commitment perspective. We show that the irreversibility of the <b>START</b> <b>transition</b> and subsequent commitment can be consistently explained in terms of the interplay of multiple bistable molecular switches. By applying an existing mathematical model to a novel problem and by expanding the model in a self-consistent manner, we achieve several goals: we bring together a large number of experimental findings into a coherent theoretical framework; we increase the scope and the applicability of the original model; we give a systems level explanation of how the <b>START</b> <b>transition</b> and the cell cycle commitment arise from the dynamical features of the underlying molecular interaction network; and we make clear, experimentally testable predictions...|$|E

Nuclear exit of the G 1 transcriptional repressor Whi 5 is a known marker of Start; APC/C-Cdh 1 is inactivated 12 min after Whi 5 nuclear exit with little measurable cell-to-cell timing variability. Multiple phosphorylation sites on Cdh 1 act in a redundant manner to repress its activity. Reducing the number of phosphorylation sites on Cdh 1 can to some extent be tolerated for cell viability, but it increases variability in timing of APC/C-Cdh 1 inactivation. Mutants with minimal subsets of phosphorylation sites required for viability exhibit striking stochasticity in multiple responses including budding, nuclear division, and APC/C-Cdh 1 activity itself.

Many molecular details of the budding yeast G 1 –S transition (Start) have been elucidated in recent years, {{especially with regard to}} its switch-like behavior due to positive feedback mechanisms. These results led us to reevaluate and ex-pand a previous mathematical model of the yeast cell cycle.

We tested the accuracy of the model by simulat-ing various mutants not described in the literature. We then constructed these novel mutant strains and compared their observed phenotypes to the model’s simulations. The experimen-tal results reported here led to further changes of the model, which will be fully described in a later article.

40|$|Budding yeast cells irreversibly {{commit to}} a new {{division}} cycle at a regulatory transition called Start. This essential decisionmaking step involves the activation of the SBF/MBF transcription factors. SBF/MBF promote expression of the G 1 cyclins encoded by CLN 1 and CLN 2. Cln 1, 2 can activate their own expression by inactivating the Whi 5 repressor of SBF/MBF. The resulting transcriptional positive feedback provides an appealing, but as yet unproven, candidate for generating irreversibility of Start. Here, we investigate {{the logic of the}} Start regulatory module by quantitative single-cell time-lapse microscopy, using strains in which expression of key regulators is efficiently controlled by changes of inducers in a microfluidic chamber. We show that Start activation is ultrasensitive to G 1 cyclin. In the absence of CLN 1, 2 -dependent positive feedback, we observe that Start transit is reversible, due to reactivation of the Whi 5 transcriptional repressor. Introduction of the positive feedback loop makes Whi 5 inactivation and Start activation irreversible, which therefore guarantees unidirectional entry into S phase. A simple mathematical model to describe G 1 cyclin turn on at Start, entirely constrained by empirically measured parameters, shows that the experimentally measured ultrasensitivity and transcriptional positive feedback are necessary and sufficient dynamical characteristics to make the <b>Start</b> <b>transition</b> a bistable and irreversible switch.

40|$|Abstract Cell size {{homeostasis}} is a conserved attribute in many eukaryotic species {{involving a}} tight regulation between {{the processes of}} growth and proliferation. In budding yeast S. cerevisiae, growth to a “critical cell size” must be achieved before a cell can progress past START and commit to cell division. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} progression past START is actively regulated by cell size control genes, many of which have implications in cell cycle control and cancer. Two initial screens identified genes that strongly modulate cell size in yeast. Since a second generation yeast gene knockout collection has been generated, we screened an additional 779 yeast knockouts containing 435 new ORFs (~ 7 % of the yeast genome) to supplement previous cell size screens. Upon completion, 10 new strong size mutants were identified: nine in log-phase cells and one in saturation-phase cells, and 97 % of the yeast genome has now been screened for cell size mutations. The majority of the logarithmic phase size mutants have functions associated with translation further implicating the central role of growth control in the cell division process.

40|$|Maintenance of {{cellular}} size {{is a fundamental}} systems level process that requires balancing of cell growth with proliferation. This is achieved via the cell division cycle, which {{is driven by the}} sequential accumulation and destruction of cyclins. The regulatory network around these cyclins, particularly in G 1, has been interpreted as a size control network in budding yeast, and cell size as being decisive for the <b>START</b> <b>transition.</b> However, it is not clear why disruptions in the G 1 network may lead to altered size rather than loss of size control, or why the S-G 2 -M duration also depends on nutrients. With a mathematical population model comprised of individually growing cells, we show that cyclin translation would suffice to explain the observed growth rate dependence of cell volume at START. Moreover, we assess the impact of the observed bud-localisation of the G 2 cyclin CLB 2 mRNA, and find that localised cyclin translation could provide an efficient mechanism for measuring the biosynthetic capacity in specific compartments: The mother in G 1, and the growing bud in G 2. Hence, iteration of the same principle can ensure that the mother cell is strong enough to grow a bud, and that the bud is strong enough for independent life. Cell sizes emerge in the model, which predicts that a single CDK-cyclin pair per growth phase suffices for size control in budding yeast, despite the necessity of the cell cycle network around the cyclins to integrate other cues. Size control seems to be exerted twice, where the G 2 /M control affects bud size through bud-localized translation of CLB 2 mRNA, explaining the dependence of the S-G 2 -M duration on nutrients. Taken together, our findings suggest that cell size is an emergent rather than a regulatory property of the network linking growth and proliferation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{specification}} {{and maintenance}} of cell fates {{is essential to the}} development of multicellular organisms. However, the precise molecular mechanisms in cell fate selection are, to our knowledge, poorly understood due to the complexity of multiple interconnected pathways. In this study, model-based quantitative analysis is used to explore how to maintain distinguished cell fates between cell-cycle commitment and mating arrest in budding yeast. We develop a full mathematical model of an interlinked regulatory network based on the available experimental data. By theoretically defining the <b>Start</b> <b>transition</b> point, the model is able to reproduce many experimental observations of the dynamical behaviors in wild-type cells as well as in Ste 5 - 8 A and Far 1 -S 87 A mutants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a moderate ratio between Cln 1 / 2 →Far 1 inhibition and Cln 1 / 2 →Ste 5 inhibition is required to ensure a successful switch between different cell fates. We also show that the different ratios of the mutual Cln 1 / 2 and Far 1 inhibition determine the different cell fates. In addition, based on a new, definition of network entropy, we find that the Start point in wild-type cells coincides with the system’s point of maximum entropy. This result indicates that Start is a transition point in the network entropy. Therefore, we theoretically explain the Start point from a network dynamics standpoint. Moreover, we analyze the biological bistablity of our model through bifurcation analysis. We find that the Cln 1 / 2 and Cln 3 production rates and the nonlinearity of SBF regulation on Cln 1 / 2 production are potential determinants for irreversible entry into a new cell fate. Finally, the quantitative computations further reveal that high specificity and fidelity of the cell-cycle and mating pathways can guarantee specific cell-fate selection. These findings show that quantitative analysis and simulations with a mathematical model are useful tools for understanding the molecular mechanisms in cell-fate decisions...|$|E

40|$|In {{real-world}} scenarios, user {{preferences for}} items are constantly drifting {{over time as}} item perception and popularity are changing when new fashions or products emerge. The ability to model the tendency of both user preferences and item attractiveness is thus vital {{to the design of}} recommender systems (RSs). However, conventional methods in RSs are incapable of modeling such a tendency accordingly, leading to an unsatisfactory recommendation performance. This thesis proposes a framework for the temporal dynamics problem in RSs. The temporal properties and dynamic information in user preferences and item attractiveness derived from user feedback over items are modeled, learned and applied to predict user preferences on items over time. The framework provides original solutions to improve the performance of RSs by incorporating and exploiting this significant but traditionally neglected information. Firstly, a novel probabilistic temporal model for RSs is developed to tackle the inherent nonlinear and non-Gaussian dynamic problem with the complex and diverse real-world recommendation scenarios. It tracks simultaneously latent factors that represent user preferences and item attractiveness. A learning and inference algorithm combining a sequential Monte Carlo method and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for this model is developed to tackle the top-k recommendation problem over time. Secondly, a novel probabilistic personalized and item-wise temporal model is proposed to solve the cold <b>start</b> <b>transition</b> (CST) problem by collaborative tendencies without any prior assumptions about the structure of the dynamics. The CST problem is first defined in this thesis, which is a result that users often leave feedback on an item only once and on only one period, preventing from learning any dynamics directly. Finally, a Bayesian Wishart matrix factorization method is proposed to model the temporal dynamics of variances due to sudden changes and other local temporal effects among user preferences and item attractiveness. It combines the collapsed Gibbs sampling method and the elliptical slice sampling method. The presented models and learning algorithms are validated experimentally on several real-world public benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that those models and algorithms significantly outperform a variety of state-of-art methods in RSs...|$|E
40|$|By {{making use}} of various social science {{research}} methods, in particular semi-structured interviews, this thesis reveals the main features of the Serbia’s 15 -year long transition experience, which took place {{against a background of}} frequent constitutional changes over the period 1989 to 2004. Serbia’s transition began in December 1989 with the Markovic programme, while the Republic was a constitutive part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). The study confirms that the SRFY was the first country to <b>start</b> <b>transition</b> from a socialist to a market economy, but that this advanced position was lost {{due to a lack of}} political consensus, and the dissolution of the country in 1991. As part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) which was formed in 1992, Serbia during the 1990 s went through the most devastating period in its modern (economic) history, experiencing the second highest and the second longest hyperinflation ever registered (1992 - 94). The battle against (hyper) inflation and economic recovery took the form of the Avramovic programme of January 1994, but failed to delivery any prolonged stabilisation and growth. Additionally, during the period of FRY, when Slobodan Miloševic was in power, an extensive regime of economic and non-economic sanctions were imposed on Serbia by the international community (1991 - 2000). Moreover, in 1999, the country was faced with the seriousness of the Kosovo conflict and NATO bombing, and the concomitant impact of these events on economic life. As a result of all this, Serbia’s transition process was stillborn throughout much of the 1990 s and public confidence in the state institutions, including the National Bank of Serbia (NBS), was entirely lost. Transition resumed in 2001, following the ‘bulldozer revolution’ of 5 October 200, and has since followed the main postulates of the transition blueprint which was based on the so-called “Washington Consensus”. The exchange-rate based stabilisation programme brought positive results as early as 2002 and 2003, notably in bringing down inflation. The combination of a de facto fixed exchange rate regime (formally announced as a managed float) and gloomy prospects of an ever-raising current account deficit and public debt, however, gave rise to a wide-ranging debate on the role of exchange rate and monetary policy in the overall profess of economic recovery. Our analysis reveals that there is a space, although limited due to the high “euroisation” of the Serbian economy, for a more active monetary policy. This would allow a substantial depreciation of the real dinar exchange rate, of importance given the demands of WTO and EU membership, namely full capital account liberalisation. Since February 2003, Serbia again changed its constitutional robe by becoming a member state of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. Following this constitutional change in June 2003, after a decade-long delay, Serbia's central bank reform was eventually initiated and the new NBS Law was enacted. The evidence contained in this work suggests that the NBS's legal independence perfectly matches the transitional average, but that the actual NBS's independence is a cause for concern. So as to prevent the inclusion of the 'systemic error' into the new Serbian constitution - by which a single person (i. e. the governor) is the sole source of monetary policymaking - the study proposes several principles which may guide the drafting process. Additionally, the thesis points to provisions of the current NBS Law which need to be adapted in line with the EMU acquis. The study concludes by rising the question of how the NBS's credibility can be restored, proposing a new NBS's approach to transparency as a possible solution.

40|$|In {{the lead}} up to major competitions, {{swimming}} coaches and sport scientists spend many hours ensuring their athlete’s training and recovery strategies are appropriate to elicit optimal performance. However, on competition day itself there are additional opportunities in which event performance might be improved by utilising various preconditioning strategies, the most common being the pre-competition warm-up. Both passive and active warm-ups can enhance swimming performance, though the competition warm-up practices of elite swimming coaches are presently unknown or have been poorly documented. In addition, competitive swimmers typically experience a delay between the pool warm-up and race <b>start</b> (<b>transition</b> phase). Transition phases of > 20 min are not uncommon which is problematic given that muscle temperature declines immediately following exercise, with appreciable reductions occurring after ~ 15 - 20 min. Additional warm-up strategies within the transition phase may therefore be required to optimise performance. Recent research has also demonstrated that completion of an exercise bout several hours prior to a competitive event may provide a priming effect to improve performance later that same day. The studies contained within this thesis aimed to investigate how altering the content of these two preconditioning strategies would affect subsequent sprint swimming performance. Study 1 : An initial survey was conducted to determine the current pre-competition warm-up practices and contemporary issues faced by elite swimming coaches (n = 46) during competition. The combination of dryland-based activation exercises followed by pool-based warm-up routines {{appears to be the}} preferred approach taken by elite swimming coaches when preparing their athletes for racing. Elite swimming coaches believe the pool warm-up affords athletes the opportunity to gain a tactile “feel” for the water and surrounding pool environment. Coaches stated that transition phases were unnecessarily lengthened due to extended marshalling periods (> 15 - 20 min), delays in the competition schedule and the lengthy time required to don race swimsuits (~ 10 min). Therefore, a number of experimental studies were undertaken {{to address the issue of}} lengthy transition phases. Study 2 : In the first of these investigations, 16 national junior swimmers completed a standardised pool warm-up followed by a 30 min transition phase and a 100 m freestyle time-trial. Within the transition phase, swimmers wore a conventional tracksuit and remained seated (Control), wore a tracksuit jacket with integrated heating elements (Passive), performed a dryland-based exercise routine (Dryland) or a combination of Passive and Dryland (Combo). Faster overall junior time-trial performances were recorded in Combo (1. 1 % ± 0. 3 %; mean ± 90 % confidence limits, p < 0. 01) and Dryland (0. 7 % ± 0. 3 %, p = 0. 02), with start times (to 15 m) also faster for Combo (0. 4 % ± 0. 1 %, p < 0. 01) compared to Control. Core temperature declined less during the transition phase in Combo (- 0. 1 ± 0. 3 °C, p = 0. 01, effect size, ES, - 1. 18) compared to Control (- 0. 6 ± 0. 2 °C), with a smaller reduction in core temperature related to better time-trial performance (R 2 = 0. 91, p = 0. 04). Elite swimmers are more consistent performers (~ 0. 8 % typical variation in performance between competitions) than their less experienced counterparts (versus ~ 1. 1 %) and may not respond to the same degree to particular interventions. Therefore, the influence of the Combo additional warm-up strategy on elite swimming performance was investigated. Studies 3 and 4 : Elite sprint freestyle (n = 25) and breaststroke (n = 10; heated tracksuit pants were used) performance was examined following completion of the Control and Combo warm-up strategies. Faster start (1. 5 % ± 1. 0 %; mean ± 90 % confidence limits, p = 0. 02) and 100 m freestyle time-trial (0. 8 % ± 0. 4 %, p < 0. 01) performances were yielded with Combo compared to Control. Core temperature again declined less during transition (- 0. 2 °C ± 0. 1 °C versus - 0. 5 °C ± 0. 1 °C, p = 0. 02, ES, 0. 78) within Combo compared to Control in freestyle swimmers. Total local (trapezius) haemoglobin concentration immediately prior to the 100 m freestyle time-trial was greater within Combo compared to Control (81 μM ± 25 μM; mean ± standard deviation, versus 30 μM ± 18 μM, p < 0. 01, ES 1. 45). Pre time-trial skin temperature was also higher in Combo (30. 6 ± 1. 0 °C, p < 0. 01, ES, 1. 10) compared to Control (29. 1 ± 1. 2 °C). Combo did not enhance elite sprint breaststroke performance (p = 0. 55) despite significantly higher Tskin values recorded immediately prior to the 100 m time-trial in Combo (30. 1 ± 0. 9 ºC; mean ± standard deviation, p = 0. 01, ES, 0. 70) compared to Control (29. 1 ± 1. 3 ºC). It was unclear if the decline in core temperature during the transition phase was less in Combo (- 0. 1 ± 0. 2 °C; mean ± 90 % confidence limits, p = 0. 36, ES, 0. 65) in comparison with Control (- 0. 3 ± 0. 2 °C) in elite breaststroke swimmers. Completion of additional warm-up strategies during the transition phase can enhance elite senior sprint freestyle, but not breaststroke performance. Study 5 : Completion of a morning (07 : 30 - 08 : 30) exercise priming bout consisting of swimming exercise (SwimOnly), swimming and dryland-based resistance exercise (SwimDry) or no exercise (NoEx) was investigated to ascertain the effect upon afternoon swimming performance (n = 13). Following a six hour break, afternoon (14 : 30 - 16 : 00) time-trial performance was faster in SwimOnly (1. 6 ± 0. 6 %; mean ± 90 % confidence limits, p < 0. 01) and SwimDry (1. 7 ± 0. 7 %, p < 0. 01). First 50 m stroke rate was higher in SwimOnly (0. 70 ± 0. 21 Hz; mean ± standard deviation, p = 0. 03) and SwimDry (0. 69 ± 0. 18 Hz, p = 0. 05) compared to NoEx (0. 64 ± 0. 16 Hz). Before the afternoon session, core (0. 2 °C ± 0. 1 °C; mean ± 90 % confidence limits, p = 0. 04, ES, 1. 03), body (0. 2 °C ± 0. 1 °C, p = 0. 02, ES, 1. 74) and skin (0. 3 °C ± 0. 3 °C, p = 0. 02, ES, 0. 78) temperatures were higher in SwimDry compared to NoEx. Completion of a morning swimming exercise bout alone or in combination with resistance exercises can enhance afternoon sprint swimming performance. Swimming coaches are concerned that lengthy marshalling periods may compromise the retention of beneficial effects induced by pre-competition warm-ups. Coaches can be advised that a combination of heated jackets and dryland-based activation exercises employed within lengthy transitions can yield benefits to sprint freestyle performance in the range of 0. 8 % (seniors) to 1. 1 % (juniors). Attenuation in the decline of core temperature and augmented total local haemoglobin concentration appear as likely mechanisms. Tracksuit pants integrated with heating elements covering a greater surface area may be required to enhance core temperature maintenance during lengthy transition phases and subsequently, elite sprint breaststroke performance. Preliminary evidence suggests that afternoon sprint swimming performance is enhanced following the completion of a morning exercise bout consisting of swimming exercise alone or in combination with resistance exercises. In summary, utilising additional warm-up strategies during the transition phase between pool warm-up end and race start and completion of a morning exercise bout prior to afternoon racing was shown to significantly enhance sprint swimming performance...|$|E
50|$|Cossey <b>started</b> <b>transitioning</b> after befriending a {{post-operative}} trans woman. By 17, Cossey {{was receiving}} hormone therapy, living full-time in a female gender role and had begun {{a career as}} a showgirl at a London nightclub. Despite initial shock, Cossey's parents were eventually supportive. Following breast augmentation surgery, Cossey worked as a showgirl in Paris and as a topless dancer in Rome to save up for sex reassignment surgery (SRS). After years of hormonal and psychological treatment, and legally changing her name, Cossey had her final surgery on 31 December 1974 at Charing Cross Hospital, London.|$|R
