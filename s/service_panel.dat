25|$|A third wire, {{called the}} bond (or earth) wire, is often {{connected}} between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures {{there is always}} a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current {{for as long as it}} takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main <b>service</b> <b>panel,</b> as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.|$|E

2500|$|... 5 February 2006: Two Short 360-300 freighters, modded for a DOD contract, {{operated}} by Air Cargo Carriers, were flying in formation when they collided near Watertown, Wisconsin, US. N3735W attempted to maneuver below N372AC in a right turn and struck the left/ underside of N372AC. [...] The left wing outer section of N3735W was struck and separated by {{the leading edge}} of N372AC's left wing, and the aircraft crashed, killing all three occupants. The left propeller of N3735W had struck the forward section of the left [...] "stub wing" [...] of N372AC (the structure housing the left main landing gear and hydraulic <b>service</b> <b>panel).</b> [...] N372AC sustained severe damage, including structural, engine, propeller (losing several blades), aerodynamic, and complete hydraulic failure (affecting flaps, landing gear, nose wheel steering, and primary brakes). [...] The crew managed to make an emergency landing at Dodge County Airport in Juneau, WI (KUNU), but overran the runway due to the damage to the aircraft. [...] The left aileron of N3735W was found on the runway that N372AC landed on. [...] Both crewmen survived uninjured, but N372AC was damaged beyond reasonable repair.|$|E
