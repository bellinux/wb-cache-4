50|$|The South African National Defense Force {{are issued}} brown combat boots with pimple print leather and <b>stitched</b> rubber <b>soles.</b> Paratroopers {{wear the same}} boots but tie them up {{in a way to}} {{increase}} ankle support.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Argentine {{soldiers}} wore hobnail boots with leather gaiters {{as well as}} jackboots. The combat boots worn during the Falklands War came with durable <b>stitched</b> rubber <b>soles.</b> These boots continue to be worn today {{in addition to the}} later pattern with [...] "EA" [...] stamped on the leg.|$|R
2500|$|Capone {{was sent}} to Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary in May 1932, aged 33. Upon his arrival at Atlanta, the [...] Capone was officially {{diagnosed}} with syphilis and gonorrhoea. He was also suffering from withdrawal symptoms from cocaine addiction, the use of which had perforated his septum. Capone was competent at his prison job of <b>stitching</b> <b>soles</b> on shoes for eight hours a day, but his letters were barely coherent. He {{was seen as a}} weak personality, and so out of his depth dealing with bullying fellow inmates that his cellmate, seasoned convict Red Rudinsky, feared that Capone would have a breakdown. Rudinsky was formerly a small-time criminal associated with the Capone gang, and found himself becoming a protector for Capone. The conspicuous protection of Rudinsky and other prisoners drew accusations from less friendly inmates, and fueled suspicion that Capone was receiving special treatment. No solid evidence ever emerged, but it formed part of the rationale for moving Capone to the recently opened Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary off the coast of San Francisco. On June 23, 1936, Capone was stabbed and superficially wounded by James C. Lucas.|$|R
50|$|Shoemakers (also {{known as}} cordwainers) may produce {{a range of}} {{footwear}} items, including shoes, boots, sandals, clogs and moccasins. Such items are generally made of leather, wood, rubber, plastic, jute or other plant material, and often consist of multiple parts for better durability of the <b>sole,</b> <b>stitched</b> to a leather upper.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of pumps is simple, using a whole-cut leather {{top with a}} low vamp, lined with either quilted silk or plain leather, trimmed with braid at the opening. The full leather sole is either glued onto the bottom, common on cheaper styles, or sewn, as on more costly bespoke styles still made traditionally, using a shallow slit to lift a flap of leather around the edge to recess and hide the <b>stitching.</b> The <b>sole</b> is, as on ordinary shoes, several layers of leather put together. The bow is made of grosgrain silk or rayon, in a pinched or flat form.|$|R
5000|$|Sometime after Memphis, Charlie for {{the first}} and only time sought work in a boot factory. In Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, he took a job in the Stetson shoe and boot factory. He {{explained}} why he left soon after: [...] "In a factory you do just one or two operations at the most... And that's all you do. You make <b>stitches</b> or <b>soles.</b> You become a part of that machine. And, you have just about as much individuality as IT does." [...] "From then on," [...] he noted, [...] "I never messed with workin' in a factory." ...|$|R
50|$|The shoe was {{designed}} by Air Jordan Senior Footwear Designer, Tate Kuerbis, a person that {{had been part of}} the Jordan footwear design team since 1999 and with Nike since 1995. The inspiration for the design came from a number of things; sleek racing lines of the auto world, carbon fibre-based monocoque of F1 race cars, race car driving shoes (rubber heel wrap) and Fine Italian dress shoes (bold <b>stitching</b> on the <b>soles).</b>|$|R
2500|$|Freed pointe {{shoes are}} made using the {{traditional}} turn shoe method, with a [...] "signature" [...] peach-colored satin. The toe box is constructed by gluing together hand-layered triangles of hessian and paper, using a proprietary, water-based glue. After {{the box is}} formed, pleats are formed in the satin that covers the shoe and secured with metal pincers. The shoe is then <b>stitched</b> and the <b>sole</b> is joined to the upper with wax thread. Next, the pointe shoe is turned right-side-out and the insole is inserted. Finally, the box, which is not yet dried, is hammered into its final shape.|$|R
50|$|The {{manufacture}} of espadrilles is generally {{more complex than}} that of sandals. The jute soles are the most critical part. The jute twines are first machine-braided. These braids are then manually formed {{into the shape of}} the sole and hydraulically pressed with heat to form the final shape and completed with vertical <b>stitching.</b> These basic <b>soles</b> are then vulcanized underneath. EVA foam or wooden heels are glued in place and more jute braids are wrapped around it to complete the soles. Uppers of different styles are then built on the jute soles to complete the espadrille.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} shoemaker would {{measure the}} feet {{and cut out}} upper leathers according to the required size. These parts were fitted and <b>stitched</b> together. The <b>sole</b> was next assembled, consisting {{of a pair of}} inner soles of soft leather, a pair of outer soles of firmer texture, a pair of welts or bands about one inch broad, of flexible leather, and lifts and top-pieces for the heels. The insole was then attached to a last made of wood, which was used to form the shoe. Some lasts were straight, while curved lasts came in pairs: one for left shoes, the other for right shoes. The 'lasting' procedure then secured the leather upper to the sole with tacks. The soles were then hammered into shape; the heel lifts were then attached with wooden pegs and the worn out-sole was nailed down to the lifts. The finishing operation included paring, rasping, scraping, smoothing, blacking, and burnishing the edges of soles and heels, scraping, sand-papering, and burnishing the soles, withdrawing the lasts, and cleaning out any pegs which may have pierced through the inner sole.|$|R
