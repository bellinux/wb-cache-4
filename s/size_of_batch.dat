40|$|AbstractMachine type {{communications}} (MTC), which mainly {{refer to}} the communications between Machines (M 2 M), draw great attention these days. Blending traffic arriving, M 2 M together with the traditional H 2 H (Human to Human), brings new problems and should change the network technologies in several aspects. Based on queuing theory, this paper models blending traffic and evaluates the service performance. The M 2 M and H 2 H present very different characteristics, so we introduce two metrics, the bursty and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>batch,</b> to model different types of services mathematically. Concepts Basic Service and BBU are proposed {{to solve the problem}} of bandwidth allocation under the blending arriving. BBU, basic bandwidth unit, is defined as the demanding bandwidth of basic service, while Basic Service refers to M 2 M shortest data service. Any other services are believed to occupy integral multiple of BBU. We get the numeric solutions of our queuing model. In performance analysis, the features of new M 2 M services are specially addressed. The simulations present the scenarios when MTC come into use, also show that some technologies proved to be effective to H 2 H services, such as bandwidth reservation which should be optimized under the blending arriving...|$|E

40|$|In the {{chemistry}} laboratory, {{the desire to}} use smaller quantities of material to minimize both reagent cost and waste generation has driven chemists to develop new experimental techniques. The current approach to small scale experimentation has mostly been a simple reduction in the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>batch</b> reaction apparatus. Working with these smaller volumes has increased the efficiency of experiments by accelerating the typically time consuming processes of heating, filtration, and drying. Furthermore, when working with hazardous materials, smaller scales minimize the exposure of a chemist to toxic materials and enable easier containment of potentially flammable or explosive systems. The use of microfluidic devices has shown several improvements when compared to traditional batch synthesis. The precise control of reaction conditions enabled within the microreactor format has proved advantageous {{for a wide range}} of single and multiphase reactions. Also, unlike conventional bench-top batch reactions, continuous microreactors are capable of producing both analytical and preparative quantities of material by simply changing the amount of reactor effluent collected. (cont.) The aim of this work was to harness the microsystem advantages of improved safety and process intensification while demonstrating both improved quality and speed of data collection, especially for chemistries that were challenging to explore using standard laboratory techniques. This work required improvements to reactor design, packaging technologies, and experimental techniques in order to use microreactors as a platform for rapidly determining optimum reaction conditions as well as reaction kinetics. Three model reactions were selected to highlight the advantages of microchemical laboratory tools. The synthesis of oligosaccharides served as an example of rapid profiling of the effects of temperature and reaction time. Microreactors improved reaction optimization by reducing waste and dramatically increasing the rate of data collection. High-pressure carbonylation of aryl halides was also explored to characterize the effects of pressure, temperature, and various substrates on product yields. With microreactors, previously inaccessible reaction conditions were explored thus obtaining improved insights into the reaction mechanism. (cont.) Finally, the production of sodium nitrotetrazolate was used to demonstrate the improved flexibility and safety of a modular microchemical system. The kinetics and pH effects for each step of the synthesis of this energetic compound were measured. This system was also optimized so that the microreactors used to characterize the reaction could be run in parallel as a production method. by Edward Robert Murphy. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Due {{to their}} wide area of applications, {{queueing}} models with batch service, where the server can process several customers simultaneously, {{have been studied}} frequently.

40|$|Research on wood drying {{and wood}} {{modification}} is primarily done in laboratories, using clear wood specimens treated under well-defined conditions in laboratory cabinets. Laboratory tests differ from industrial treatment both regarding the <b>size</b> and homogeneity <b>of</b> the material treated, and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>batch</b> and kiln used. Knowledge {{about how the}} <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the material treated and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>batch</b> or kiln influence the results is limited, which {{makes it difficult to}} utilize results from laboratory research in development of industrial processes. A better understanding of the influence <b>of</b> <b>size</b> can also improve the possibilities to design laboratory studies so that the results are easier to implement industrially. The studies presented in this thesis focus on how the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>batches</b> treated and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the individual wood samples treated influence the process and resulting properties of the wood. The aim of the studies, the so called researchquestion {{in the context of a}} PhD-thesis, is to help transfer knowledge gained from testing small wooden samples in laboratories to industrial treatment <b>of</b> full <b>size</b> timber. This thesis describes studies on vacuum drying, high temperature (HT) drying, and thermal modification of wood according to the Thermowood© process. Drying and thermal modification of wood have been studied under industrial andlaboratory conditions. Kiln climates and wood response have been determined during vacuum drying, conventional drying, high temperature drying, and thermal modification. The results show that both the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the material treated and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the kiln or batch strongly influence the processes and the resulting wood properties. The results show that the sample size influences different material properties in different ways. Equilibrium moisture content is reduced less during thermal treatment of small clear wood specimens than during treatment of dimensionaltimber. Mass loss on the other hand is higher in small samples. Reduction in impact bending strength, mass loss, and reduction in EMC after thermal treatment of dimensional timber do not seem to be correlated. Laboratory treatment of small clear wood specimens show considerably stronger influence on the wood properties than treatment of similar samples together with industrial production.

Vetiver grass is highly preferred for oviposition, {{in spite of the}} fact that larval survival is extremely low on this grass. The oviposition behaviour of female Chilo partellus moths was investigated by determining the amount and <b>size</b> <b>of</b> egg <b>batches</b> allocated to maize and Vetiver plants and studying the effect of rearing conditions and oviposition experience on host plant selection. Two-choice preference tests were used to examine the effect of experience of maize (a suitable host plant) and Vetiver plants on the oviposition choice of C. partellus. For both field-collected and laboratory-reared moths, no significant differences were found in the preference distributions between the experienced groups. It is concluded that females do not learn, i. e. that they do not change their preference for Vetiver grass after having experienced oviposition on either maize or this grass, which supports the idea that trap cropping could have potential as a control method for C. partellus. Differences observed between field-collected and laboratory-reared moths in the amount and <b>size</b> <b>of</b> egg <b>batches</b> laid on maize and Vetiver grass indicate that data obtained from experiments with laboratory-reared insects should be treated with caution...|$|R
