Semisynthetic polymers, HPMC K 4 M, HPMC K 100 M and natural polymer, Xanthan gum were used as release retarding agents. Sodium bicarbonate was used as a gas-generating agent. Dicalcium phosphate was used as a channeling agent. The floating matrix tablets of Atenolol were prepared by direct compression method. The concentration of polymers and a gas-generating agent was optimized to get the controlled release of atenolol for 8 h. The prepared tablets were evaluated for physicochemical parameters and found to be within range. A significant difference in drug release at 0. 5, 1, 4 and 8 h (p < 0. 0001) was observed. The floating lag time of all the formulations was within the prescribed limit (< 10 min.) Release pattern of Atenolol was fitted to different models based on coefficient of correlation (R). All the formulations showed good matrix integrity. All the formulations retarded the release of drug for 8 h. Based on the diffusion exponent (n) value, drug release was found to be diffusion controlled. The swelling studies of all the formulations showed that formulations containing Xanthan gum has higher <b>swelling</b> <b>indices</b> than HPMC K 100 M and HPMC K 4 M.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to prolong the gastric {{residence}} time of atenolol by designing its floating tablets and to study the influence of different polymers on its release rate. Nine formulations of atenolol containing varying concentrations of polymers were designed by optimization. The floating matrix tablets of atenolol were prepared by direct compression method. The prepared tablets were evaluated for physicochemical parameters such as hardness, floating properties (floating lag time, floating time and matrix integrity), swelling studies and drug content. The physicochemical parameters of formulated tablets were found to be within normal range. A significant difference in drug release (P < 0. 0001) and floating lag time (P < 0. 005) at 0. 5, one, four and eight hours were observed. The floating lag time of all the formulations was within the prescribed limit (&# 60; 10 minutes). All the formulations showed good matrix integrity and retarded the release of drug for eight hours. The release pattern of atenolol was fitted to different models based on coefficient of correlation (r). All the formulations, except F 2, F 3 and F 6 showed Korsemeyer-Peppas model as the best fit model. Formulation F 2 and F 3 showed first order model while F 6 showed zero order model. Diffusion exponent (n) value was found in the range of 0. 52 - 0. 99 indicating diffusion as a release mechanism. The swelling studies of all the formulations showed that formulations containing Xanthan gum has higher <b>swelling</b> <b>indices</b> than HPMC K 100 M and HPMC K 4 M.

40|$|International audienceOnly few {{data are}} {{available}} concerning {{the effect of the}} four main clay minerals, kaolinite (K), illite (I), montmorillonite (M) and chlorite (C), on the mechanical properties of clayey soils. This paper discusses the effect of different mineral contents on the compression and <b>swelling</b> <b>indexes</b> of clay mixtures in order to provide correlations between the mineralogical content of a clayey soil and its compressive properties. Four pure clay powders were used to prepare 34 clay mixtures (different proportions of K+I, K+I+M, K+I+C). Conventional oedometer tests were conducted on all the prepared samples. Based on the test results, the evolution of the compressive properties with the proportions of pure clays was estimated and relevant correlations are suggested. All the results demonstrate that the compression and <b>swelling</b> <b>indexes</b> are reasonably well correlated to the proportion of clay minerals. The content in montmorillonite influences significantly the compressive properties of clayey soils, and the contents of illite and chlorite are less influential when added to kaolinite based clayey soils. Moreover, 15 samples with different proportions of K+I+M+C were prepared and tested, and the proposed correlations were validated in light of the results obtained on these materials...|$|R

Mechanical and biodegradable behaviour of LDPE became noticeably worse when it was blended with agrofiller, due to poor compatibility between the two phases. The presence of MAPE in the composites and its compatibility with the agrofiller, led to much better dispersion and homogeneity of agrofiller in the matrix and consequently to improved properties.

The nitrogen content was considered as a probably better indicator {{of the level of}} wrinkle-free treatment than the <b>swelling</b> <b>index</b> (water retention) commonly used in the industry. In this work, the relationship between the nitrogen content and <b>swelling</b> <b>index</b> (water retention) were studied. The effects of nitrogen content and <b>swelling</b> <b>index</b> (water retention) on the tear strength and the dynamic water absorbency were investigatedThe results showed that(1) The <b>swelling</b> <b>index</b> (water retention) has a strong linear relationship with the total nitrogen content in the fabric. The higher nitrogen content, the lower the <b>swelling</b> <b>index</b> (water retention). (2) The fabric tear strength is highly correlated with the total nitrogen content or the <b>swelling</b> <b>index</b> (water retention). High nitrogen content or low <b>swelling</b> <b>index</b> (water retention), which may be resulted from the wrinkle-free treatment, causes low tear strength. (3) High nitrogen content or low <b>swelling</b> <b>index</b> (water retention) reduces the water absorption rate of the fabric and increases the contact angle when the water drop is in initial contact of the fabric. In general, the study showed that <b>swelling</b> <b>index</b> (water retention), a simple test commonly used in the industry, is as good a parameter as the nitrogen content, which is difficult to measure, for evaluating the level of wrinkle-free treatment. Wrinkle-free treatment can generally reduce the tear strength and the dynamic water absorption rate.

40|$|MSc (Chemistry), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Alkali {{compounds}} {{were added}} to a South African coal with a high swelling propensity and the behaviour of the blends were investigated. A vitrinite-rich bituminous coal from the Tshikondeni coal mine in the Limpopo province of South Africa was used. To reduce {{the influence of the}} minerals in the coal, the coal was partially demineralized by leaching with HCl and HF. The ash content of the coal sample was successfully reduced from 17. 7 % to 0. 6 %. KOH, KCl, K 2 CO 3 and KCH 3 CO 2 were then added to the demineralized coal in mass percentages of 1 %, 4 %, 5 % and 10 %. The free <b>swelling</b> <b>indices</b> (FSI) of the blends were determined and the samples were subjected to acquisition of TMA and TG-MS data. Addition of these potassium compounds to the demineralized coal reduced the swelling of the vitrinite-rich coal. From the free <b>swelling</b> <b>indices</b> of the various mixtures, it was concluded that the potassium compounds reduce the swelling of the coal in the following order of decreasing impact: KCH 3 CO 2 > KOH > K 2 CO 3 > KCl. From dilatometry experiments done on the blends with the 10 % addition of potassium compounds, it was seen that with the addition of potassium compounds to the demineralized coal, a reduction in dilatation volume was obtained. The influence of the potassium compound in decreasing order: K 2 CO 3 > KOH> KCH 3 CO 2 > KCl. An increase in the softening temperature was observed for the demineralized coal-alkali blends. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed on the demineralized coal-potassium blended samples (< 75 μm). These samples were pyrolyzed under a nitrogen atmosphere to a maximum temperature of 1200 °C using a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The relative reactivity for each of the blends with the different wt% addition was determined. From these results it was seen that KCH 3 CO 2 increased the relative reactivity, whereas the KOH, KCl and K 2 CO 3 showed an inhibiting influence. The attached mass spectrometer provided information on the low molecular mass gaseous products formed in the various temperature ranges as the thermal treatment proceeded. From the mass spectroscopy results, {{it was found that the}} potassium compounds decreased the temperature at which maximum evolution of H 2 takes place. Thermomechanical analyses were performed on the 10 wt% addition of the potassium compounds to the demineralized coal. During TMA analyses, the sample was heated to 1000 °C using a heating rate of 10 °C/min. From the TMA result obtained it was clear that the addition of KCl did not have an influence on the swelling of the demineralized coal. All results are discussed. Master...|$|R

Interactions of clay particles with the medium surface {{in the presence of}} permeating fluid have been recognized as a critical parameter controlling the fate of clay particles. These interactions are strongly functions of the ionic strength of the permeating fluid.

To alleviate these limitations, semi-empirical models are proposed in this thesis to predict the variation of swelling pressure of both compacted and natural expansive soils with respect to soil suction using the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) as a tool. An empirical relationship is also suggested for estimating the <b>swelling</b> <b>index</b> from plasticity index values, alleviating the need for conducting oedometer tests. The predicted swelling pressure and estimated <b>swelling</b> <b>index</b> are then used to estimate the variation of 1 -D heave with respect to suction for expansive soils by modifying Fredlund (1983) equation. The proposed approach is validated on six different compacted expansive soils from US, and on eight field sites from six countries; namely, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Canada, China, US, and the UK. The proposed simple techniques presented in this thesis are friendly for the practitioners for using when estimating the heave in unsaturated expansive soils...|$|E

40|$|Greywater {{produced}} {{daily in}} households is generally discharged to public waterways without prior treatment. As {{the health risks}} posed by the water are considered low, its disposal and possible negative impact on natural water bodies are not regulated. In a typical Malaysian household, used water from the laundry, bathroom and kitchen contribute to the total greywater discharge. The paper describes a laboratory-based examination of peat as a potentially cheap and effective filter media for household greywater. The greywater was prepared with controlled measures of common contaminants to represent the types of household greywater commonly produced. The filtered water quality was monitored over a month to gauge {{the effectiveness of the}} peat kilter media. The peat, upon filtration of the different greywater after 28 days, was subjected to the oedometer test to examine its 1 -dimensional compressibility characteristics in relation with the filtration process. The findings indicated that the peat media could be beneficial in the removal of suspended solids and lowering of BOD (Eiiological Oxygen Demand) and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) of the greywater, though laundry greywater showed some worrying signs of excessive residual chemicals left in the discharge. The compressibility test data showed bahaviour commonly observed in soft materials like peat, with an apparent reduction of settlement post-filtration of the greywater. The reduction of void ratio (e) and water content (w), pre- and post-tests was found to be following a linear pattern, while the bulk density (p) showed less compatibility, especially of the mixed greywater water sample. The compression and <b>swelling</b> <b>indices</b> (C, and CJ were shown to be related with a power law equation. Overall, the compressibility of peat improved post-filtration with lower void ratio and water content. It is postulated that the impurities and chemicals entrapped in the peat media contributed to the enhanced stiffness...|$|R
