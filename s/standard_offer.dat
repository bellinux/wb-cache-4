The feed-in tariff guaranteed a fixed price of $0.42 CDN per kWh {{over a period of}} twenty years. Unlike net metering, all the electricity produced was sold to the OPA at the given rate.|$|E

25|$|Most {{applicants}} who {{are called}} for interview {{will have been}} predicted at least three A-grade A-level qualifications relevant to their chosen undergraduate course, or the equivalent in other qualifications, such as getting at least 7,7,6 for higher-level subjects at IB. The A* A-level grade (introduced in 2010) now plays {{a part in the}} acceptance of applications, with the university's <b>standard</b> <b>offer</b> for most courses being set at A*AA, with A*A*A for sciences courses. Due to a very high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, the interview process is crucial for distinguishing between the most able candidates. The interview is performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors such as potential for original thinking and creativity. For exceptional candidates, a Matriculation Offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above. In 2006, 5,228 students who were rejected went on to get 3 A levels or more at grade A, representing about 63% of all applicants rejected.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} receives applications {{mainly through}} UCAS and the Common Application {{with the latest}} figures showing that there are generally 12 applications per undergraduate place available. Overall, the university {{is one of the}} most competitive universities in the UK, with 2016-17 having an acceptance rate of 8.35% and offer rate of 22.5% for Scottish/EU applicants where places are capped by the Scottish Government. In 2017, the most competitive courses for Scottish/EU applicants were those within the Schools of International Relations, Management, and Economics and Finance with offer rates of 8.0%, 10.9% and 11.5% respectively. The <b>standard</b> <b>offer</b> of a place tends to require five best Highers equivalent to AAAAB, three best A-levels equivalent to AAA or a score of at least 38 points on the International Baccalaureate. Successful entrants have, on average, 525 UCAS points (the equivalent of just above A*A*AA at A Level) ranking it as the 5th highest amongst higher education institutions in the UK for the 2015 admissions cycle with The Telegraph naming it as the hardest university to gain admission into in Scotland.|$|E

50|$|To {{comply with}} PURPA, some states began {{offering}} <b>Standard</b> <b>Offer</b> Contracts to producers. California's Public Utility Commission established {{a number of}} <b>Standard</b> <b>Offer</b> Contracts, including <b>Standard</b> <b>Offer</b> No.4 (SO4), which made use of fixed prices, based on the expected long-run cost of generation. The long-run estimates of electricity costs {{were based on the}} belief (widely held at the time) that oil and gas prices would continue to increase. This led to an escalating schedule of fixed purchase prices, designed to reflect the long-run avoided costs of new electrical generation. By 1992, private power producers had installed approximately 1,700 MW of wind capacity in California, some of which is still in service today. The adoption of PURPA also led to significant renewable energy generation in states such as Florida, and Maine.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the GEA, Ontario had enacted a number of different programs to introduce renewable energy or promote conservation. These included the Energy Conservation Leadership Act, the Energy Efficiency Act and of particular note, November 2006's Renewable Energy <b>Standard</b> <b>Offer</b> Program. The <b>Standard</b> <b>Offer,</b> also known as SOP or RESOP for short, introduced a number of fixed 20-year feed-in tariffs for hydro, wind, solar (PV) and biomass projects. RESOP tariffs were relatively low, 42 cents/kWh for PV and 11 cents/kWh for other forms of energy. At the time, RESOP was named North America's first true feed-in tariff program.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 the Ontario Power Authority {{introduced}} the Renewable Energy <b>Standard</b> <b>Offer</b> Program. This program {{was replaced with}} the 2009 Feed-In Tariff program for renewable energy (FIT). The FIT program is further divided into the MicroFIT program for projects less than 10 kW, designed to encourage individuals and households to generate renewable energy.|$|E

50|$|This notwithstanding, PURPA retains {{negative}} connotations in the U.S. electricity industry. When oil and {{gas prices}} plummeted in the late 1980s, the <b>Standard</b> <b>Offer</b> Contracts that were signed to encourage new renewable energy development seemed high by comparison. As a result, PURPA contracts {{came to be seen}} as an expensive burden on electricity ratepayers.|$|E

50|$|A {{feed-in tariff}} (FIT, FiT, <b>standard</b> <b>offer</b> contract, {{advanced}} renewable tariff, or renewable energy payments) {{is a policy}} mechanism designed to accelerate investment in renewable energy technologies.

Rather than pay an equal amount for energy, however generated, technologies such as wind power and solar PV, for instance, are awarded a lower per-kWh price, while technologies such as tidal power are offered a higher price, reflecting costs that are higher at the moment.|$|E
