The method studies the new <b>stabilized</b> FVM {{with the relationship}} between the <b>stabilized</b> FEM (FEM) and the <b>stabilized</b> FVM under the assumption of the uniqueness condition. The results have three prominent features in this paper. Firstly, the error analysis shows that the <b>stabilized</b> FVM provides an approximate solution with the optimal convergence rate of the same order as the usual <b>stabilized</b> FEM solution solving the stationary Navier-Stokes equations. Secondly, superconvergence results on the solutions of the <b>stabilized</b> FEM and <b>stabilized</b> FVM are derived on the H 1 -norm and the L 2 -norm for the velocity and pressure. Thirdly, residual technique is applied to obtain the L 2 -norm error for the velocity without additional regular assumption on the exact solution...|$|R

It {{is not clear that}} what kinds of factors have influence on Ca(OH) 2 saturation in the <b>stabilized</b> soil. In this research, a set of soil samples with different cationic exchange capacity were selected, <b>stabilized</b> soil specimens are prepared by mixing the soil samples with different proportions of cement and Ca(OH) 2. The influence of soil cationic exchange capacity on the strength of the <b>stabilized</b> soil are investigated by means of measuring the concentrations of main ions in the pore solutions squeezed from the <b>stabilized</b> soil specimens and the strength of the <b>stabilized</b> soil. It is revealed that: cationic exchange of the soil samples depresses the Ca(OH) 2 saturation of the <b>stabilized</b> soil. When the cationic exchange capacity of the soil samples is high enough, the Ca(OH) 2 concentration of the pore solution in the <b>stabilized</b> soil cannot get saturated, under these conditions, further cationic exchange depletes Ca 2 +, OH- which shall be used to generate calcium silicate hydrate, so the amount of calcium silicate hydrate decreases, which results in the poor strength of the <b>stabilized</b> soil...|$|R

40|$|Deep <b>stabilized</b> peat columns {{could be}} {{considered}} as attractive and economical foundation for construction of highway embankments on deep peat ground. However, peat itself is very problematic and failure {{in the formation of}} the columns with adequate strength was often attributed to unsuitable type and insufficient dosage of binder added to the organic soil. Organic matter in peat was known to impede the cementing process in the soil, thus, retarding the early strength gain of <b>stabilized</b> peat. To evaluate the strength characteristics of <b>stabilized</b> peat, laboratory investigation on early strength gain of the <b>stabilized</b> soil was conducted to formulate a suitable and economical mix design that can be effectively used for the soil stabilization. To achieve such purpose, the study examined the effect of binder, sodium chloride as cement accelerator and silica sand as filler on the unconfined compressive strength of <b>stabilized</b> peat after 7 days of curing in water. Binders used to <b>stabilize</b> the peat were Ordinary Portland cement, ground granulated blast furnace slag, sodium bentonite, kaolinite, lime and bentonite. All the <b>stabilized</b> peat specimens were tested using unconfined compression apparatus. The test results revealed that the <b>stabilized</b> peat specimen (80 OPC: 10 GGBS: 10 SB) with addition of 4 sodium chloride by weight of binder and 50 well graded silica sand by volume of wet peat at 300 kg m - 3 binder dosage yielded the highest unconfined compressive strength of 196 kPa. This implied that, the higher the dosage of silica sand in <b>stabilized</b> peat, the more solid particles will be available for the binder to unite and form a load sustainable <b>stabilized</b> peat. It could be summarized that, as the rate of hydration process of <b>stabilized</b> peat was accelerated by inclusion of sodium chloride, the solid particles contributed to the hardening of <b>stabilized</b> peat by providing the cementation bonds to form between contact points of the particles...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhile {{a certain}} {{correlation}} between the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the soil {{and the strength of}} the cement <b>stabilized</b> soil has been reported, the mechanism remains unclear. In this research, a set of soil samples with different CECs were <b>stabilized</b> with different proportions of cement and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2, CH). The influence of soil CEC on the strength of the <b>stabilized</b> soil was investigated by analyzing the CH saturation in the pore solution and measuring the strength of the <b>stabilized</b> soil specimens. It is revealed that cation exchange in the soil can reduce the CH saturation of the <b>stabilized</b> soil. If the CEC of the soil is too high, the CH in the pore solution of the <b>stabilized</b> soil cannot reach the saturation level, and further cation exchange would then consume the Ca 2 + ions which should be originally used to generate calcium silicate hydrate, thus result in the poor strength of the <b>stabilized</b> soil...|$|R

5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} global financial crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at <b>stabilizing</b> foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and <b>stabilizing</b> regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E

5|$|When some {{component}} of a trait is heritable, selection alters the frequencies of the different alleles, or variants of the gene that produces the variants of the trait. Selection {{can be divided into}} three classes, {{on the basis of its}} effect on allele frequencies: directional, <b>stabilizing,</b> and purifying selection. Directional selection occurs when an allele has a greater fitness than others, so that it increases in frequency, gaining an increasing share in the population. This process can continue until the allele is fixed and the entire population shares the fitter phenotype. Far more common is <b>stabilizing</b> selection, which lowers the frequency of alleles that have a deleterious effect on the phenotype – that is, produce organisms of lower fitness. This process can continue until the allele is eliminated from the population. Purifying selection conserves functional genetic features, such as protein-coding genes or regulatory sequences, over time by selective pressure against deleterious variants.|$|E

5|$|Beer is {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grains — most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and <b>stabilizing</b> agent.

In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.|$|E
