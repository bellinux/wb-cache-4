40|$|Measurements and {{predictions}} of railway-induced vibrations {{are becoming a}} necessity in today’s society where land scarcity causes buildings to be put close to railway traffic. The short distances mean {{an increased risk of}} the indoor vibration and noise disturbances experienced by residents. In short, the scope of the project is to investigate the transmission loss and vibration level decrease across various junction geometries. The junctions are modelled in both the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Dynamic Stiffness Method (DSM). Resonances are avoided when possible by using semi-infinite building components. A two-dimensional model that included Timoshenko beams was set up by Wijkmark [1] and solved using the variational formulation of the DSM by Finnveden [2]. The model is efficient and user-friendly but there is no easy way to adjust the junction geometry since the depths of the walls and the floor slabs are the same. From that study, the current topic was formulated. The results presented in this paper indicate that both the Euler-Bernoulli DS model and the three-dimensional FE model have good potential in describing the vibration transmission across the different junction geometries. The two modelling types <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> in the analyses of the bending wave attenuation than in the analyses of the quasilongitudinal wave attenuation. One of the probable causes is that the set length of the Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) is not sufficient at such low frequencies. Larger PMLs require bigger geometries that lead to an increase of the computational time. The other proposed reason is the fact that bending waves are created above the asymmetrical junction when the lower beam is excited by a vertical harmonic force. The flexural displacements are neglected in those cases. The results however, were good enough to be satisfactory. Three junction models were investigated and the attenuation is the highest for both wave types in the case with a beam pair attached to the “middle” of an infinite plate. The attenuation is the second highest across the edge of a semi-infinite plate and the lowest across a junction corner of a semi-infinite plate. As part of the suggested future work, the wave transmission between beam and plate needs to be investigated when Timoshenko beams are included in the DS model. In the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory the cross-section remains perpendicular to the beam axis, which is different to the behaviour of solid elements in FEM...|$|E
40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} variability of the phytoplankton {{community in the}} tropical coastal Imboassica lagoon, an environment naturally isolated from the ocean by a narrow sandbar, was analysed every two weeks for 19 months by sampling three sites. During this study, the lagoon received direct input of marine water three times, resulting in remarkable salinity, nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass variations in both temporal and spatial aspects. The phytoplankton biomass presented relatively low values ranging, on average, from 0. 54 mg. L- 1 in the station closest to the sea (station 1) to 1. 34 mg. L- 1 in the station close to a macrophyte bank (station 3). Diatoms and cryptomonads dominated in stations 1 and 2 (located relatively close to station 1, yet receiving the runoff of domestic sewage), and euglenoids, cryptomonads and dinoflagellates at station 3. Stations 1 and 2 usually presented the same dominant species but station 2 presented a higher phytoplankton biomass. On the other hand, station 3 <b>showed</b> <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> concerning phytoplankton biomass with station 2, however the dominant species were usually different.

The {{aim of this study}} is to define the independent and interactive roles of some cytokines namely, TNF, IL- 6, IL- 1 together with NO and TEARS in the genesis of HCC following the infection with such viruses. Patients and methods: Blood samples were taken from 58 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and were divided into four groups: a) 28 patients with HCV, b) 10 patients with HBV, c) 11 patients with B+C, d) 9 patients without viral infection. In addition, 20 healthy subjects served as control group for each, TNF, IL- 6, and IL- 1 were measured using ELISA technique, in addition to NO and TBARs using chemical methods. Results: Patients with coinfection B-C viral infection showed the highest levels in studied parameters. Patients with HCV and HBV separately <b>showed</b> <b>more</b> or less <b>similar</b> <b>results.</b> However, patients without viral infection showed the least higher levels comparing to the control group. Conclusion: Cytokines in addition to NO and TEARS have a definite role in hepatic carcinogenesis. Coinfection with the two viruses carries a synergistic risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma development. Depending on the results of the studied parameters HCV did not show predominancy on HBV. Further studies are needed to clarify the exact mechanism of carcinogenesis especially in HCV patients...|$|R

This {{is not the same as}} saying that this fraction of an individual phenotype is caused by genetics. In addition, heritability can change without any genetic change occurring, such as when the environment starts contributing to more variation.

Heritability could increase if genetic variation increases, causing individuals to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> phenotypic variation, like showing different levels of intelligence. On the other hand, heritability might also increase if the environmental variation decreases, causing individuals to show less phenotypic variation, like <b>showing</b> <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> levels of intelligence.

Total energy output (milk energy and TDEE) averaged 12. 36 ± 1. 03 MJ/d with DLW compared with 1 1. 74 ± 1. 3 MJ/d with HR monitoring, a 5. 8 % difference (NS).

These is-sues grow more salient as demands on an already fragile preschool "system " intensify: Head Start spending has climbed, rising interest in "school readiness “ prompts concern over preschool distri-bution and quality, and welfare reform will boost enrollment pressure.

Archival videotapes were coded for the face-to-face interaction behaviors of preadolescent best friend and acquaintance dyads and same-sex and opposite-sex dyads. The dyads had been identified by sociograms completed by 56 sixth grade children. The dyads were then videotaped in face-to-face interactions.

40|$|We {{examine how}} three {{fundamentally}} different numerical hydrodynamics codes follow {{the evolution of}} an isothermal galactic disc with an external spiral potential. We compare an adaptive mesh refinement code (RAMSES), a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code (sphNG), and a volume-discretised meshless code (GIZMO). Using standard refinement criteria, we find that RAMSES produces a disc that is less vertically concentrated and does not reach such high densities as the sphNG or GIZMO runs. The gas surface density in the spiral arms increases at a lower rate for the RAMSES simulations {{compared to the other}} codes. There is also a greater degree of substructure in the sphNG and GIZMO runs and secondary spiral arms are more pronounced. By resolving the Jeans' length with a greater number of grid cells we achieve <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> to the Lagrangian codes used in this study.

This suggests differences also arise which are not intrinsic to the particular method but rather due to its implementation.
