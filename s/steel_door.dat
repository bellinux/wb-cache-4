5|$|The {{interior}} of the tower is divided by iron floors and spiral stairways into four stories. The ground floor was originally used for oil store, and it now houses the light equipment, including a generator. Access to the tower was originally through the ramped stone steps on the north, entering the first floor. This entrance was since sealed, and a <b>steel</b> <b>door</b> on the ground level is now used.|$|E
5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a solid <b>steel</b> <b>door.</b> He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as {{called for in the}} script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a <b>steel</b> <b>door</b> in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E

5|$|The {{victims are}} {{informed}} by microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; {{one is in}} the room's safe, and a cryptic clue is provided. Xavier ignores a warning note and uses a key on the door, which fires a bullet through the peephole and Gus' eye, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the room lets them out, with no success: Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory oven to obtain two antidotes inside, but inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes; In the next room, Xavier throws Amanda into a syringe-filled pit intended for himself, and though {{she is able to}} retrieve the key, he is unable to unlock the <b>steel</b> <b>door</b> behind which the antidote sits before the timer expires and he leaves out of frustration. Throughout the game, they discuss connections between them and determine that each has been jailed before; the sole exception is Daniel, who has nonetheless been arrested before.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{strength}} {{is sometimes a}} temporary by-product of regeneration. In the moments following his regeneration into his eighth incarnation, the Doctor possessed enough physical strength to batter a <b>steel</b> <b>door</b> completely off its hinges. Also, shortly after his third regeneration, the Fourth Doctor karate chopped a brick in half in episode one of Robot, {{and was unable to}} repeat the action later in the same serial.|$|E
25|$|After its excavation, the tomb's {{entrance}} {{was fitted}} with a <b>steel</b> <b>door,</b> which however was later removed and replaced by stone blocking. By 1944, this blocking had collapsed and filled the tomb's entrance with debris. In 1993, the tomb was cleared again by Lyla Pinch Brock. In 1996, she undertook conservation work on the stairs and the plastering inside the burial chamber through {{a grant from the}} American Research Centre in Egypt.|$|E
5000|$|From April 1966, {{the trains}} were {{reclassified}} [...] "600 series", and {{roughly half of}} the former driving cars were rebuilt as intermediate cars with the cabs removed. At the same time, the headlamps were changed from the original incandescent light bulbs to sealed beam headlamps, and the original <b>steel</b> <b>doors</b> were replaced with new stainless <b>steel</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{cells were}} {{extremely}} small, with three concrete walls with no windows, {{and a solid}} <b>steel</b> <b>door</b> with a five-inch square window facing the corridor. The cells contained only a wash basin/toilet combination (cold water only), and a radio selector (there were two channels), and a concrete pad covered with a sheet of plywood four inches off the floor on which the inmates slept. Inmates could not control {{the volume of the}} radio nor the temperature of the cell. The lights in the cell remained on 24 hours a day, but were dimmed to 25 watts at night.|$|E
25|$|In January 1997, {{two teams}} of 12 from the ARW {{were sent to}} Mountjoy Prison in central Dublin where three prisoners armed with knives had taken two prison {{officers}} hostage and barricaded themselves inside the Medical Unit where they were threatening to kill the prison officers. The ARW took up positions ready to blow down the <b>steel</b> <b>door</b> to the unit and eliminate {{the threat posed by}} the hostage-takers. The siege ended within a few hours of the ARW being called in, after the hostage takers were made aware of their presence during negotiations and surrendered.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{designs were}} adapted to local {{circumstances}} and available building materials such that, outwardly, two pillboxes {{of the same}} basic design could look quite different. The height of a pillbox could vary significantly according to local needs: some were half buried so that the embrasures might be as low as ground level, others were raised up to give a better view; those built into hillsides might lack embrasures on some walls; the entrance could be moved and its size varied as might be convenient {{and there may be}} additional walls to protect the entrance, a free standing blast wall or a <b>steel</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} days of World War II, local {{residents}} planned to use Derrick Cave as an air-raid shelter if the Japanese began bombing the west coast of the United States. While residents of Central Oregon never needed an air raid shelter during World War II, Derrick Cave was designated as a nuclear fallout shelter in 1963. Supplies of food and water for up to 1,200 people were stored at the site. The supplies were stored in a small branch of the cave behind a locked <b>steel</b> <b>door.</b> However, vandals broke into the supply vault on several occasions and plundered the food cache. The vandals left the civil defense water cans, probably because they had frozen solid. By 1970, all of the supplies had been stolen by vandals or removed by civil defense authorities.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 {{most of the}} slates {{were removed}} to prevent more gables {{collapsing}} from pressure on the walls. Three magnolia trees are growing out of {{the foundations of the}} east wing and cover the exterior, which has lost two gables. The east wing contains a ground floor room with no windows, a concrete ceiling and a <b>steel</b> <b>door</b> which remains unopened since the estate offices closed in 1972. In September 2010, a collapse in the west wing caused further damage to the 1832 stairwell. The rooms above the parlour were destroyed as the roof and wall collapsed and the drawing room's rear wall partially collapsed. English Heritage assessed the damage as urgent and structural work was needed to prevent further collapse. In November 2011 contractors for the HTNW dismantled the north wing porch as the gable was at risk of collapse. Decorative masonry was removed for an exhibition that was held in Nelson in 2012 by the HTNW.|$|E
500|$|The Führerbunker {{was built}} by the Hochtief company {{as part of an}} {{extensive}} program of subterranean construction in Berlin. It was finished by 1944 and was connected to the Vorbunker by a stairway set at right angles (not a spiral staircase). The two bunkers could be closed off from each other by a bulkhead and <b>steel</b> <b>door.</b> A permanent guard detail was posted by the <b>steel</b> <b>door.</b> The Führerbunker was located about [...] beneath the garden of the old Reich Chancellery, [...] north of the new Reich Chancellery building at Voßstraße6. The Führerbunker was located 2.5 meters lower than the Vorbunker and to the west-southwest of it. The accommodations for Hitler were moved to the Führerbunker, and by February 1945 it had been decorated with high-quality furniture taken from the Chancellery, along with several framed oil paintings.|$|E

500|$|After {{the fire}} in 1976, vandals caused {{additional}} damage {{that resulted in the}} windows being bricked up and a <b>steel</b> <b>door</b> installed. Restoration and preservation of the light is done through the volunteer [...] "Faulkner's Light Brigade", which formed in 1991. In 1997, Walter Sedovic was selected by a Lighthouse Restoration Committee to perform the restoration of the lighthouse. Completed in 1999, the restorations included painting the interior and exterior, replacing the door and a new entry deck made of Pau Lope wood.|$|E
500|$|He was {{admitted}} to St. Elizabeths Hospital, and in June the following year Dorothy was declared his legal guardian. He was held {{for a time in}} the hospital's prison ward—Howard's Hall, known as the [...] "hell-hole", a building without windows—in a room with a thick <b>steel</b> <b>door</b> and nine peepholes to allow the psychiatrists to observe him as they tried to agree on a diagnosis. Visitors were admitted for only 15 minutes at a time, while patients wandered around screaming and frothing at the mouth.|$|E
500|$|When Little Ferry, New Jersey {{contractor}} William Fehrs {{was hired}} to construct a film storage facility in 1934, he designed the structure to be fireproof. The building had [...] outer walls and a reinforced concrete roof. Internally, it was divided into forty-two individual vaults, each enclosed behind a <b>steel</b> <b>door</b> and separated with [...] brick interior walls. The local fire department confirmed Fehrs's fireproofing. Despite the potential for fire, the facility was located in a residential neighborhood, and was equipped with neither a fire sprinkler system nor mechanical ventilation.|$|E

500|$|In 1859, a {{rectangular}} [...] by [...] two-story rear addition {{was added to}} the jail. Made of cut granite blocks and topped with a flat roof, the addition added five cells on each level and two hallways with a cast iron staircase on the left hand side. The addition was not in perfect alignment with the original common wall, and protrudes east. Access is gained from the original center hallway and heading outside to the additions' front door, a second access point from within the original building is a <b>steel</b> <b>door</b> on the common wall. The inside of the new cell block has a wood plank corridor and iron railings with tall windows, opposite the cells, that face south.|$|E
500|$|The [...] storage facility, {{operated}} by Iron Mountain Incorporated, consists of street lights amid two-story buildings, all [...] "erected beneath the old limestone caves leased from" [...] the Snyder Estate for 99 years.

500|$|Hitler's {{accommodations}} {{were in this}} newer, lower section, and by February 1945 it {{had been}} decorated with high-quality furniture taken from the Chancellery, along with several framed oil paintings. After descending the stairs into the lower section and passing through the <b>steel</b> <b>door,</b> {{there was a long}} corridor with a series of rooms on each side. On the right side were a series of rooms which included generator/ventilation rooms and the telephone switchboard. On the left side was Eva Braun's bedroom/sitting room (also known as Hitler's private guest room), an ante-chamber (also known as Hitler's sitting room), which led into Hitler's study/office. On the wall hung a large portrait of Frederick the Great, [...] one of Hitler's heroes. A door led into Hitler's modestly furnished bedroom. Next to it was the conference/map room (also known as the briefing/situation room) which had a door that led out into the waiting room/ante-room.|$|E
50|$|Alterations {{had to be}} made in the mid-1960s; {{the stylish}} opening had to be blocked in with steel walls, and <b>steel</b> <b>doors</b> had to be fitted. The {{appearance}} was largely sacrificed; the regulations concerning fire precautions duly satisfied.|$|R
