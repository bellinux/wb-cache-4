5|$|The Phantom <b>Stranger</b> {{asks the}} Justice League Dark, {{specifically}} Zatanna, {{to help him}} enter Hell to save his family. In Trinity of Sin: The Phantom <b>Stranger</b> #10, Zauriel warns Phantom <b>Stranger</b> that he is never allowed to enter Heaven again, having gone {{to try to save}} his family. Zauriel states to Phantom <b>Stranger</b> that if he tries, he will be erased from time and history.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>Stranger</b> {{continues}} {{to explore the}} island, books linking to more Ages are discovered hidden behind complex mechanisms and puzzles. The <b>Stranger</b> must visit each Age, find the red and blue pages hidden there, and return to Myst Island. These pages can then {{be placed in the}} corresponding books. As the <b>Stranger</b> adds more pages to these books, the brothers can be seen and heard more clearly. After collecting four pages, the brothers can talk clearly enough to tell the <b>Stranger</b> where the fifth and final missing page for their book is hidden; if the <b>Stranger</b> can complete either book, that brother will be set free. The clearer dialog also allows the player to more accurately judge each brother's personality. The <b>Stranger</b> is left with a choice to help Sirrus, Achenar, or neither.|$|E
5|$|Sirrus and Achenar beg the <b>Stranger</b> not {{to touch}} the green book that is stored in the same {{location}} as their final pages. They claim {{that it is a}} book like their own that will trap the <b>Stranger.</b> In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the <b>Stranger</b> to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the <b>Stranger</b> to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the <b>Stranger</b> and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book and return to the island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn marks on the shelves where they used to be.|$|E

5|$|As in {{previous}} games, the player assumes {{the role of}} the <b>Stranger,</b> a friend of Atrus. A member of the D'ni race, Atrus can create links to other worlds called Ages by writing descriptive books. In Exile, Atrus has written an Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure. The <b>Stranger</b> pursues the thief in an attempt to reclaim Atrus' book.|$|E
5|$|Atrus {{calls the}} <b>Stranger</b> {{to his home}} in Tomahna to request his friend's assistance. Atrus is the writer of special books, which serve as links to worlds known as Ages. Twenty years earlier, his two sons, Sirrus and Achenar, {{destroyed}} his library on Myst and trapped their parents in order to plunder the wealth of Atrus' Ages. The Stranger's intervention saved Atrus, who had imprisoned his sons via traps intended for thieves. Atrus' wife Catherine hopes that, after twenty years, they have finally repented for their crimes. Atrus is not as sure his sons have reformed, and so wishes the <b>Stranger</b> to act as an impartial judge. After being knocked unconscious by an explosion, the <b>Stranger</b> realizes that Yeesha, Atrus' daughter, has disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Atrus {{writes a}} new Age called Releeshahn for the D'ni {{survivors}} {{to rebuild their}} civilization as he and Catherine settle back on Earth, raising a daughter named Yeesha. As Atrus prepares to take the <b>Stranger</b> to Releeshahn, a mysterious man named Saavedro appears and steals the Releeshahn Descriptive Book. The <b>Stranger</b> follows Saavedro through several Ages (which were used to train Sirrus and Achenar {{in the art of}} writing Ages), before finally recovering the book. Ten years later, Atrus asks for the Stranger's help in determining if his sons have repented after their lengthy imprisonment; the <b>Stranger</b> saves Yeesha from Sirrus' machinations, but Sirrus and a repentant Achenar are killed. D'ni is not fully restored until the creatures the D'ni enslaved, known as the Bahro, are freed.|$|E

5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a <b>stranger</b> who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The <b>stranger</b> tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the <b>stranger</b> fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{compare the}} {{difference}} between giving by Partners and giving by <b>Strangers</b> in experiments with different dimensions of histories of past actions and different lengths of trials. In experiments with twenty trials, our experimental evidence shows that Partners contribute more than <b>Strangers</b> in most rounds when the histories of group contributions are not revealed to <b>Strangers.</b> The difference becomes smaller if this information is made available to <b>Strangers,</b> and eventually disappears if both Partners and <b>Strangers</b> are further informed about the histories of individual contributions. However, in experiments with two sequences of ten trials, Partners still contribute more than <b>Strangers</b> even if the histories of individual contributions are known. These observations suggest that more symmetric and detailed information regarding past actions reduces {{the difference between}} giving by Partners and giving by <b>Strangers,</b> but sufficient repetitions are necessary for this difference to be markedly reduced...|$|R
