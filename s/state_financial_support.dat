2500|$|Collectivization did {{not just}} entail the {{acquisition}} of land from farmers but also the closing of churches, burning of icons, and the arrests of priests. [...] Associating the church with the tsarist regime, the Soviet state continued to undermine the church through expropriations and repression. They cut off <b>state</b> <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> {{to the church and}} secularized church schools. Peasants began to associate Communists with atheists because the attack on the church was so devastating. The Communist assault on religion and the church angered many peasants, giving them more reason to revolt. Riots exploded after the closing of churches as early as 1929.|$|E

On November 18, 2010, the Regents finally gave up on the longstanding legal fiction that UC does not charge tuition by renaming the Educational Fee to [...] "Tuition."

2500|$|SB 10 was controversial. The law was {{challenged}} by planning opponents with a ballot initiative in 1970, which was defeated. Despite the law being {{upheld by the}} voters, the lack of <b>state</b> <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> for the law's planning mandates and entrenched resistance in certain counties undermined {{the effect of the}} law. By the end of 1971, the deadline set by the law, fewer than one-third of Oregon's counties and just over 40% of the state's cities had adopted the comprehensive plans and [...] "border-to-border" [...] zoning ordinances required by law. Unable to cope with non-compliance on such a massive scale, the Governor's office — which was to take over the task of planning and zoning in the event of failure by lower governmental authorities — was forced to grant extensions en masse. Oregon's land-use planning system remained incomplete and in need of more powerful central authority.|$|E

[...] Still, together with James Madison, Jefferson carried on a long and successful campaign against <b>state</b> <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> of churches in Virginia. Also, it is Jefferson who coined the phrase [...] "wall of separation between church and state" [...] in his [...] of Connecticut.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} study of electrochemically active surface states on MOCVD-grown n-type GaN in aqueous electrolytes using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy {{over a wide}} range of potentials and frequencies. In order to alter the surface states, the GaN samples are either etched or oxidized, and the influence of the surface treatment on the defect-mediated charge transfer to the electrolyte is investigated. Etching in HCl removes substoichiometric GaO, and leads to a pronounced density of electrochemically active surface states. Oxidation effectively removes these surface <b>states.</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>support</b> from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG STU 139 = 12 1), TUM. solar in the frame of the Bavarian Collaborative Research Project “Solar technologies go Hybrid” (SolTec) and the Excellence Cluster Nanosystems Initiative Munich is gratefully acknowledged.

40|$|This cross-state {{empirical}} study {{focuses on}} the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and examines {{its impact on the}} academic research and development (R&D) expenditures financed by state governments. Based on a panel of 50 states during 1979 - 2006, the empirical results indicate that EPSCoR, while increasing federal R&D support to EPSCoR <b>states,</b> crowded out <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> for academic research from the governments of EPSCoR states. About one-third of EPSCoR funds went to subsidize state budgets. The crowd-out effect calls for some reconsideration of EPSCoR program design in order to maintain or even increase the <b>state</b> government <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> for academic research activities deemed critical to academic competitiveness and economic prospects. © 2009 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|R
