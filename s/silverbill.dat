50|$|The nest, being {{suspended}} from thorny trees and overhanging water, is protected from many predators, but nest predation by crows is not unusual. Brood {{may also be}} destroyed by lizards such as Calotes versicolor or rodents such as Vandeleuria oleracea which may take over the nest. Nests may sometimes be taken over and used for nesting by munias and Indian <b>silverbills</b> (Euodice malabarica).|$|R
50|$|Lonchura is a genus of the estrildid finch family, and {{includes}} munias (or minias), mannikins, and <b>silverbills.</b> They are resident breeding birds in Africa and in South Asia from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka east to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines. Two {{of the approximately}} thirty-seven species are also native to Australia. The name mannikin is from Middle Dutch mannekijn 'little man' (also {{the source of the}} different bird name manakin).|$|R
5000|$|Euodice is a genus of estrildid songbirds that is {{recognized}} by some authorities while some include {{it within the}} genus Lonchura where it is treated as a subgenus. [...] Its members are from the dry zones of Africa and India and are {{commonly referred to as}} <b>silverbills.</b> The African and Indian species were earlier considered conspecific because they can interbreed. They are phylogenetically distinct and form a clade that is basal to other relatives in Estrildidae.|$|R
50|$|The grey-headed <b>silverbill</b> is gregarious, {{moving in}} small flocks and often mixing with African <b>silverbill.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{most ancient}} {{evolutive}} group comprises African (African <b>silverbill),</b> Asian (Indian <b>silverbill)</b> and Australian (diamond firetail); {{this suggests that}} the whole Estrildids radiation might have originated around India.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] African <b>silverbill</b> [...] (Euodice cantans) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird formerly considered conspecific {{with the}} Asian species Indian <b>silverbill,</b> (Euodice malabarica). This estrildid finch is a common resident breeding bird in dry savanna habitat, south of the Sahara Desert. This species has also been introduced to other countries such as Portugal, Qatar and United States.|$|E
50|$|The grey-headed <b>silverbill</b> wanders widely, {{influenced}} by weather and shifting availability of sources of water.|$|E
50|$|The grey-headed <b>silverbill</b> is {{commonly}} found in dry savanna habitat but never {{too far away from}} water.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} found in the {{duodenum}} and small intestine of both the Indian <b>silverbill</b> (Lonchura malabarica) and the scaly breasted munia (Lonchura punctulata).|$|E
50|$|The call is {{a high-pitched}} chitter and sharp chi-tit like Indian <b>silverbill,</b> and the male’s song is a musical goldfinch-like melody with twitters and trills.|$|E
50|$|The Indian <b>silverbill</b> or {{white-throated munia}} (Euodice malabarica) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird found in the Indian Subcontinent and adjoining regions that was formerly considered to include the closely related African <b>silverbill</b> (Euodice cantans). This estrildid finch is a common resident breeding bird in the drier regions of the Middle East and the Indian Subcontinent. It has also been introduced into {{many other parts of}} the world and has become established in some areas. They forage in small flocks in grassland and scrub habitats.|$|E

50|$|The grey-headed <b>silverbill</b> feeds {{mostly on}} grass seeds. But {{it has been}} {{suggested}} that the species also feed on insects which are more a source of moisture than dry seeds.|$|E
50|$|The African <b>silverbill</b> is {{currently}} trapped for the cage bird trade. However, its numbers and its considerable range mean {{that this is}} unlikely to have any impact on the species' survival.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also home}} to a variety of birds including, Indian roller, black-winged kite, grey hornbill, grey partridge, Eurasian {{collared}} dove, white-throated kingfisher, ashy-crowned sparrow lark, shrike, laughing dove, blue-cheeked bee-eater, Indian <b>silverbill,</b> eagle and babbler.|$|E
50|$|The grey-headed <b>silverbill</b> is {{a stocky}} bird with a grey head studded with white dots. Its body is greyish-brown with partly black wings and tail {{and a white}} rump. The {{juvenile}} can be told by its white rump.|$|E
50|$|The African <b>silverbill</b> is tame and sociable, {{often found}} {{perching}} in trees in dense flocks, touching one another. However, it {{is a particularly}} inactive bird, sitting huddled together {{for a long period}} of time. It stays in flocks all year round and usually breeds in loose colony.|$|E
50|$|The {{similarities}} {{within this}} {{group and the}} existence of subspecies with differing vocalisations and plumage mean that some races may be elevated to species status. African and Indian <b>silverbill</b> are now usually considered distinct species, and the two races of black-throated munia are often also split.|$|E

50|$|The grey-headed <b>silverbill</b> (Odontospiza caniceps), {{also known}} as pearl-headed mannikin, is a species of estrildid finch found in eastern Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, and Tanzania. It has an {{estimated}} global extent of occurrence of 400,000 km². It is now usually placed in the monotypic genus Odontospiza as Odontospiza caniceps. It is sometimes placed in the genus Lonchura.|$|E

50|$|The African <b>silverbill</b> feeds {{mostly on}} grass seeds, picked {{from the ground}} but also taken from the growing plants if available. It will cling to grass stems to take seeds from the inflorescences. It seems that it feeds mainly on {{vegetable}} matter and rearing its young on seed as well. However, it has been recorded to take aphids from water mint (Meinertzhagen 1954).|$|E
50|$|The nest of the African <b>silverbill</b> {{is usually}} {{built in the}} form of a roundish bundle of grasses. It is lined with soft fibres and {{sometimes}} feathers, and may be placed in a thick bush or hedge or amongst the creepers on a house. The male is recorded in the wild as collecting all the nesting material (Meinertzhagen 1954), while the female only shares in construction.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{resident}} bird species {{that can be}} seen here are little green bee-eater, blue-tailed bee-eater, plain prinia, ashy prinia, zitting cisticola, greater coucal, pied cuckoo, common kingfisher, pied kingfisher, white-breasted kingfisher, white-breasted waterhen, ruddy-breasted crake, slaty-breasted rail, tricolored munia, Indian <b>silverbill</b> (white-throated munia), scaly-breasted munia, red munia, paddyfield pipit, yellow bittern, black bittern, purple-rumped sunbird, purple sunbird, clamorous reed-warbler, pied wagtail, Asian palm swift, pond heron, black-shouldered kite, spotted dove and laughing dove.|$|E
50|$|The African <b>silverbill</b> is {{approximately}} 10 cm in length {{with a long}} black pointed tail. The adult has a stubby silver-blue bill, finely vermiculated light-brown upper parts, whitish underparts, black rump and black wings. The sexes are similar, but immatures lack the vermiculations. This species has a tseep call and a trilling song. The contact call of the male is a single tseep while the female is a double noted tsiptsip. Birds in flight keep up a constant tseep tseep tseep.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} earlier {{placed in the}} genus Lonchura but some authors {{suggested}} their placement in the genus Euodice. The placement was much debated but more recent studies {{suggest that it is}} closely related to the African <b>silverbill</b> (now Euodice cantans) and the two form a clade that is well separated from other Lonchura finches. A molecular phylogeny study identifies the separation of the species from the nearest common ancestors of Euodice cantans (of Africa) and Stagonopleura guttata (of Australia) around 11 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|In early literature, African <b>silverbill</b> (Euodice cantans) and Indian <b>silverbill</b> (E. malabarica) {{were treated}} as conspecific. In 1943, Jean Théodore Delacour firmly united both species in his {{revision}} of the Estrildinae. However, in 1964, James M. Harrison first studied the two in a strictly comparative manner and concluded that they were two separate species. He discovered that although the call notes were similar, the songs are distinctly different in form, but sharing a common pattern. They are sympatric {{in the south of}} the Arabian Peninsula and there is no record of natural hybridization. From Harrison's personal observation of birds in captivity, each of the two forms evinced a preference for its own kind. In 1985, Kakizawa and Watada confirmed Harrison's conclusion. They confirmed the genetic difference of the two species by the means of protein electrophoresis. In 1990, Sibley and Monroe accept the two as distinct species. Molecular sequence divergence studies indicate that this species along with the Indian siverbill are basal, having diverged from the common ancestors of other Lonchurae about 11 MYA. This and other evidence including differences in the arrangement of down in chicks and behaviour leads some authors to placing them in the separate genus Euodice.|$|E
50|$|The adult Indian <b>silverbill</b> is 11-11.5 cm {{long and}} has a conical silver-grey bill, buff-brown upperparts, white underparts, buffy flanks and dark wings. The tail is black and the wings are dark {{contrasting}} with a white rump. The sexes are similar, but immatures have buff underparts and a shorter tail. The tail appears pointed as {{the length of the}} feathers reduces from the centre outwards. It feeds mainly on seeds, but also takes insects and has been known to visit nectar bearing flowers, such as those of Erythrina trees.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a member}} of the estrildid finch family. Many {{authorities}} call it a domestic form of the white-rumped munia (known in aviculture as the striated finch), at least probably, though some state that it originated as a hybrid of this species with others in the genus Lonchura. A DNA study found that it was more closely related to the white-rumped munia but not belonged to indian muniya family than either bird is to the finch, the chestnut-breasted munia, or the [...] "Silver Bill" [...] (presumably the <b>silverbill),</b> indicating that it originated from the white-rumped.|$|E
50|$|This munia was {{described}} as Loxia malabarica by Linnaeus who placed it along with the crossbills. Subsequently they {{were included in the}} genera Uroloncha and Aidemosyne and later in the genus Lonchura into which many of the estrildid finches were included by Jean Delacour in his 1943 revision. The species earlier included Lonchura cantans, the African <b>silverbill,</b> which is found in the dry savannah habitats south of the Sahara Desert. In captivity the African birds were found to preferentially pair with mates within their own populations and did not recognize the Indian populations as conspecific. They are however known to produce fertile hybrids.|$|E
