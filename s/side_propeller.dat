40|$|Within the EU {{research}} project VIRTUE, a propeller is investigated in uniform and nonuniform inflow conditions {{by means of}} a RANS equation solver, FINFLO. The analyses are made in wetted and cavitating conditions. The propeller analyzed in this paper is the INSEAN E 779 A propeller. The paper contains calculations at three different grid resolutions in wetted conditions and at the two finest grid resolutions in cavitating conditions in uniform inflow. The mediumsize grid is used for the propeller in nonuniform inflow simulations. The simulations are conducted on a model scale and the results are compared with the measurements and cavitation tests performed by INSEAN. The nonuniform inflow is generated by modeling the geometry of the artificial wake generator used in the cavitation tests in the calculation domain. The experimental results are published in several papers, for example in [1] and [2]. The predicted propeller open water thrust and torque are found to be within 5 % of the measured ones. The pressure peak at the leading edge of a blade is found {{to be sensitive to the}} grid resolution. The predicted cavitation behavior of the propeller blades is in reasonable accordance with the cavitation test observations. In uniform inflow the vaporized region is overpredicted. Contrastingly, the vaporized region is Underpredicted in the nonuniform inflow calculations. Side entrant jets could be identified in the cavity region in the nonuniform inflow simulations. The predicted vaporized regions in several blade positions together with photographs of the cavitating propeller are shown for comparison. The cavitation behavior trends seemed to be similar in the simulations and observations in nonuniform inflow, except that the rollup of detached sheet cavitation into a tip vortex could not be captured in the calculations. The total wake is measured between the propeller plane and the wake generator. The predicted wake is found to be too strong, but the width of the wake is relatively close to the measurements. The propeller loading history is shown over one propeller revolution. It shows qualitatively reasonable trends. The loading histories of the wetted and cavitating propeller are almost the same due to the relative small cavitating region in the investigated conditions. The pressure distributions at several blade positions on the suction <b>side</b> of the <b>propeller</b> are shown in wetted and cavitating conditions for comparison...|$|R
5000|$|Fundamental to {{low-speed}} maneuvering is {{an understanding}} of the configuration and handedness of the propeller(s). An effect known as propeller walk will kick the stern of the vessel to port or starboard depending on the configuration and the type of propeller when large variations on propeller rotation speed or changes of propeller rotation direction take place. (In single-screw vessels where the rotation of the propeller is reversed on an astern bell, a standard was established that the propeller would turn clockwise when viewed from astern. This would mean that the propeller would turn counterclockwise when going astern and the stern would walk to port. This aided in docking operations, where [...] "port side to" [...] was the preferred situation and the vessel would be brought to the dock with a small bow-in angle and backing would flatten the angle, slow or stop the vessel and walk it alongside. An exception to this was the U.S. Sealift class tankers, which used a controllable-pitch propeller, where the pitch and not the direction of rotation was reversed to go astern. These propellers rotated counterclockwise at all times and so the [...] "walk" [...] was [...] "normal".) Other variations include what are known as bucket rudders such as the Kortz Nozzle where instead of a conventional rudder a pair of dish-shaped rudders, one either <b>side</b> of the <b>propeller</b> can be swivelled vertically to direct the propeller thrust through 360 degrees. Thus to put the vessel into astern mode the rudder can be rotated through 180 degrees without altering the speed and direction of the engine. Since with the conventional propeller or rudder configuration the propeller is designed to operate at maximum efficiency when going ahead, it produces far less thrust when going astern. But with the Kortz Nozzle, the ahead and astern thrust is the same. Other advantages of the nozzle are the ship can be steered astern which a conventional rudder cannot, and the ship can be steered fully under control to a standstill switching between ahead and astern mode to give complete control over speed. In addition to being fully conversant with the principles of seamanship and ship-handling, a good pilot will have developed his or her sense of 'situational awareness' to a point well beyond that of a member of a ship's crew; his reactions will appear to be instinctive, positive and at all times safe.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the sensitivity of the index test with focus on the behavior of the guide vane and runner blade angles. This was achieved by comparing the cam curves from an index test with a design of experiment. Index tests are a popular method for determining cam curves for Kaplan turbines. Index tests, as they are performed today, do not take into account a suspected hysteresis phenomenon in the guide vane and runner blade mechanism. If and how this affects the cam curve is today unknown which this project has investigated. An experiment was designed based on the “design of experiment” method. The difference from a traditional index testing is that the measurements were performed in a random order and only two propeller curves were plotted, but with eight replicates. Ten different guide vane angles were used; five for each runner blade angle and a total of 80 measurements were performed over the span of two days. Then, the measurements were compared with the results from an index test performed the day before on the same machine, a full-scale turbine in the Lule Älv-river using the same equipment. When analyzing the distribution of the efficiency, it has a larger spread on the left hand <b>side</b> of the <b>propeller</b> curve compared to the best efficiency point and negligible variation around the best efficiency point. The difference in the cam curves between the two methods was smaller than the estimated measurement error at the best efficiency point. The peak efficiency in the experiment was found for a slightly higher flow rate at one of the runner blade angles but this point was between two settings at the index test. The variations in efficiency are at their largest before the peak and may vary between a high efficiency and significantly lower efficiency at this point. Additional measurements may reduce the risk for choosing a guide vane angle at which such behavior occurs. A constant difference in the readings between the fixed scale and the station sensor were observed for the runner blade mechanism. This difference varied with the runner blade angle and amounted to 0. 26 ° for 1 ° and 0. 70 ° for 4 ° runner blade angle. For the guide vane mechanism no hysteresis could be validated. A difference between the fixed scale and the station sensor which varied depending on the direction was spotted and could be validated with 95 % significance.

40|$|The use of azimuth {{thrusters}} as {{main propulsion}} device and for manoeuvring of ships is increasing {{over the past}} decades. However, the understanding of hydrodynamic loads acting on such devices in oblique inflow conditions is still an interesting area of research as it is generally believed that such loads can be partially responsible {{for the failure of}} parts of power transmission system to the thruster. A deeper understanding of such loads can provide critical mechanical design considerations for the parts involved in transmitting power such as bevel gears, bearing and seals as well the parts of thruster housing. Thus, the aim of this research is to provide an insight into the behavior of hydrodynamic loads of a pulling open type steerable thruster particularly the steering moment, including extreme oblique inflow conditions at various ship speeds and power absorption. A numerical investigation of steering thrusters is performed for various conditions. For this a turbulence model is used and for simulating manoeuvring tests transient conditions are used where as open water tests are simulated using quasi steady conditions. These simulations are based on RANS method for solving the flow with standard k-epsilon model with a high y+ wall treatment around an azimuth thruster system. A commercial code of Star CCM+ is used for performing the simulations. Post processing results give an insight into the critical flow regions and contribution of loads and moments of the system. Validation is done with available model scale data, tested at MARIN institute at Netherlands. The results showed an acceptable agreement to do further analysis of the steering moment behaviour at various steering angles and advance ship speeds. Behaviour of various hydrodynamic loads is discussed in the results section. In general, the various hydrodynamic forces were found to be increasing with increase in steering angles and symmetrical for mirrored conditions. As numerical simulations provide the feasibility of studying loads on individual components, the contribution of individual parts of the thruster for different forces and moments was also analyzed. The side force moment created by the <b>propeller</b> <b>side</b> is balanced mainly by anti moments created by the skeg and the remainder is taken up by the steering motor torque to keep the thruster at a particular steering position under such external hydrodynamic loads. Detailed asymmetrical flow fields are discussed which arise due to oblique angle and spinning of fluid due to propeller rotation. Finally, the pulling thruster under study was compared with a ducted pushing thruster for hydrodynamic loads and the results are discussed in detail. The steering moments in both cases rise very steeply with steering angles and are significant at higher steering angles. Also, in case of a pulling thruster there is a fluctuating steering moment present even in straight inflow conditions unlike the pushing unit, which can be of interest when comparing these two type of configurations.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2011. Major: Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics. Advisor: Krishnan Mahesh. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 141 pages, appendix A. Crashback is an operating condition to quickly stop a propelled vehicle, where the propeller is rotated in the reverse direction to yield negative thrust. The crashback condition {{is dominated by}} the interaction of the free stream flow with the strong reverse flow. This interaction forms a highly unsteady vortex ring, which is a very prominent feature of crashback. Crashback causes highly unsteady loads and flow separation on the blade surface. The unsteady loads can cause propulsor blade damage, and also affect vehicle maneuverability. Crashback is therefore well {{known as one of the}} most challenging propeller states to analyze. This dissertation uses Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) to predict the highly unsteady flow field in crashback. A non-dissipative and robust finite volume method developed by Mahesh et al. (2004) for unstructured grids is applied to flow around marine propulsors. The LES equations are written in a rotating frame of reference. The objectives of this dissertation are: (1) to understand the flow physics of crashback in marine propulsors with and without a duct, (2) to develop a finite volume method for highly skewed meshes which usually occur in complex propulsor geometries, and (3) to develop a sliding interface method for simulations of rotor-stator propulsor on parallel platforms. LES is performed for an open propulsor in crashback and validated against experiments performed by Jessup et al. (2004). The LES results show good agreement with experiments. Effective pressures for thrust and side-force are introduced to more clearly understand the physical sources of thrust and side-force. Both thrust and side-force are seen to be mainly generated from the leading edge of the suction <b>side</b> of the <b>propeller.</b> This implies that thrust and side-force have the same source - the highly unsteady leading edge separation. Conditional averaging is performed to obtain quantitative information about the complex flow physics of high- or low- amplitude events. The events for thrust and side force show the same tendency. The conditional averages show that during high amplitude events, the vortex ring core is closer to the propeller blades, the reverse flow induced by the propeller rotation is lower, the forward flow is higher at the root of the blades, and leading and trailing edge flow separations are larger. The instantaneous flow field shows that during low amplitude events, the vortex ring is more axisymmetric and the stronger reverse flow induced by the vortex ring suppresses the forward flow so that flow separation on the blades is smaller. During high amplitude events, the vortex ring is less coherent and the weaker reverse flow cannot overcome the forward flow. The stronger forward flow makes flow separation on the blades larger. The effect of a duct on crashback is studied with LES. Thrust mostly arises from the blade surface, but most of side-force is generated from the duct surface. Both mean and RMS of pressure are much higher on inner surface of duct, especially near blade tips. This implies that side-force on the ducted propulsor is caused by the blade-duct interaction. Strong tip leakage flow is observed behind the suction side at the tip gap. The physical source of the tip leakage flow is seen to be the large pressure difference between pressure and suction sides. The conditional average for high amplitude event shows consistent results; the tip leakage flow and pressure difference are significantly higher when thrust and side-force are higher. A sliding interface method is developed to allow simulations of rotor-stator propulsor in crashback. The method allows relative rotations between different parts of the computational grid. Search algorithm for sliding elements, data structures for message passing, and accurate interpolation scheme at the sliding interface are developed for arbitrary shaped unstructured grids on parallel computing platforms. Preliminary simulations of open propulsor in crashback show reasonable performance...|$|R
