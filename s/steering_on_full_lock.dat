5000|$|Ironically, it was {{the engines}} that caused the Gamma to have a poor name. They {{overheated}} far too easily, wore its cams, and leaked oil. The wishbone bushes wore out early, and, because the power steering was driven from the left cam-belt, the car was prone to snapping that belt when <b>steering</b> was <b>on</b> <b>full</b> <b>lock</b> [...] - [...] with disastrous results. By the time the FL1 was launched most of these problems had been addressed, but the damage was done, and the car's poor reputation cemented. The whole marque suffered from similar reputation problems; compare with the Lancia Beta.|$|R
5000|$|While {{filming the}} scene where a van drove in circles with {{no one at the}} wheel, one of the actors was run over, but {{immediately}} stood up uninjured. During the flower burning scene, the same actor caught fire and Werner Herzog raced over and beat the fire out. The actor only had minor injuries from the fire. After these two accidents, Herzog promised the actors that if they made it through the rest of filming without any more injuries he would jump into a cactus patch and allow the actors to film him doing so. The film was finished without any further injuries and the director made good his promise and dived into the cacti. Herzog has said, [...] "Getting out was a lot more difficult than jumping in." [...] In the Les Blank documentary Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe, Herzog can be seen limping slightly as he exits an airplane, presumably from the cacti incident. The vehicle-in-circles scene was inspired by an incident that occurred when Herzog worked as a steward at the Munich Oktoberfest as a young man. Part of his duty was ensuring that drunk patrons did not attempt to drive their cars home, so when a drunk man insisted that he was capable of driving, Herzog got into his car with him, placed the <b>steering</b> wheel <b>on</b> <b>full</b> <b>lock,</b> then got out of his car. The man passed out and the car continued to drive in a circle until it ran out of petrol.|$|R

40|$|With recent {{technological}} advances, {{shared memory}} parallel machines {{have become more}} scalable, and offer large main memories and high bus bandwidths. They are emerging as good platforms for data warehousing and data mining. In this paper, we focus on shared memory parallelization of data mining algorithms. We have developed a series of techniques for parallelization of data mining algorithms, including <b>full</b> replication, <b>full</b> <b>locking,</b> fixed <b>locking,</b> optimized <b>full</b> <b>locking,</b> and cache-sensitive locking. Unlike previous work on shared memory parallelization of specific data mining algorithms, all of our techniques apply to {{a large number of}} popular data mining algorithms. In addition, we propose a reduction-object-based interface for specifying a data mining algorithm. We show how our runtime system can apply any of the techniques we have developed starting from a common specification of the algorithm. We have carried out a detailed evaluation of the parallelization techniques and the programming interface. We have experimented with apriori and fp-tree-based association mining, k-means clustering, k-nearest neighbor classifier, and decision tree construction. The main results from our experiments are as follows. 1) Among full replication, optimized <b>full</b> <b>locking,</b> and cachesensitive locking, there is no clear winner. Each of these three techniques can outperform others depending upon machine and dataset parameters. These three techniques perform significantly better than the other two techniques. 2) Good parallel efficiency is achieved {{for each of the four}} algorithms we experimented with, using our techniques and runtime system. 3) The overhead of the interface is within 10 percent in almost all cases. 4) In the case of decision tree construction, combining diffe [...] ...|$|R
