30|$|A machine {{diagnosis}} system entails {{developing a}} system {{that can be used}} to monitor in real-time and detect faults present in different subsystems of a machine. This uses some intelligent rule-based machine fault detection algorithms developed by experts of such machine systems. Given this, the RVS machine diagnosis system involves the utilization of sensors such as thermocouples, strain gauges, accelerometers, oil level sensors and smart bolt wireless sensors to measure in real-time the temperature at which the vibrating motor powering the RVS machine is running. The sensors must measure the real-time stress and deformation that the RVS subsystems such as screen panels, screen deck frame, side plates, <b>side</b> <b>liner</b> plates, back plates, torsion bar, torsion bar brackets and M- 16 bolts e.t.c. of the machine are subjected to. They must ascertain real-time vibrations generated by the vibrating motor. They must monitor the lubricating oil level of the oil compartment of vibrating motor. The oil is responsible for the lubrication of shaft and bearing powering the vibrating motor. The measured values obtained from these sensors are then compared with the rule-based RVS subsystems performance algorithms developed by RVS machine manufacturer. This will alert the users and maintenance managers of this machine when over-heating and knocking of the vibrating motor occurs and when deformation, degradation and wear of the aforementioned subsystems of the RVS machine sets in. It will reveal when the shaft, bearing and half-circular spinning discs (responsible for the machine vibration) inside the vibrating motor deform, break and wear.|$|E

40|$|The {{turbulent}} flame in the lean combustion regime in a gas turbine combustor generates significant thermo-acoustic noise. The thermo-acoustic noise induces liner vibrations {{that may lead}} to fatigue damage of the combustion system. This phenomenon is investigated in the project FLUISTCOM using both an experimental and a numerical approach. The correlation between acoustic pressure oscillations on one <b>side</b> and <b>liner</b> vibrations on the other side is a prime interest. In order to have better insight in the processes present in the combustion chamber, a combustion test rig was designed and manufactured at the University of Twente. One of the most important parts of the test rig is a liner with a flexible section and optical access to measure the vibration pattern and amplitude. This paper describes a flame investigated at 1. 5 bar, 125 kW with premixed natural gas and air.

CFX-Ansys was used for the transient numerical calculations of the transient combustion flow within the combustion chamber. Simultaneously, the pressure results from the near-wall region were collected and sent as initial conditions to a structural code (Ansys).

The paper will present the numerically predicted results on the combustion field, the accompanying oscillating pressure field, and the induced structural vibration of the combustor liner. These results will be compared with the available experimental data. 1...|$|R
40|$|The piston ring–cylinder liner {{contact is}} {{a major source of}} the total {{parasitic}} losses in an internal combustion engine. The lubrication process of this contact highly influences the amount of friction, oil consumption and wear that occurs.

A special piston ring and cylinder liner holder were designed and five sensors were glued on to the back <b>side</b> of the <b>liner</b> specimen. Ultrasonic reflections captured by the sensors, used to obtain the film thickness, and friction were continuously recorded as the piston ring section reciprocated over the liner. Several experiments were performed at different speed and load conditions. Furthermore, a numerical model has been developed to predict film thickness and friction in all lubrication regimes. The experimentally measured film thickness and friction were compared with the output from the numerical model and good correlation was found.

A Mrs. W.H.

She then noted that the officers in charge of the evacuation and several male passengers managed to regain order on the boat deck over these men.|$|R

Wasn't there lying about on that liner's bridge, fitted with all sorts of scientific contrivances, a couple of simple and effective cork-fenders--or on board of that Norwegian either? There must have been, since one ship was just out of a dock or harbour and the other just arriving. That is the time, if ever, when cork-fenders are lying about a ship's decks. And there was plenty of time to use them, and exactly in the conditions in which such fenders are effectively used. The water was as smooth as in any dock; one ship was motionless, the other just moving at what may be called dock-speed when entering, leaving, or shifting berths; and from the moment the collision was seen to be unavoidable till the actual contact a whole minute elapsed. A minute,--an age under the circumstances. And no one thought of the homely expedient of dropping a simple, unpretending rope-fender between the destructive stern and the defenceless side! ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 16 October 2018. This paper {{considers}} the acoustic {{performance of a}} passive damper in which acoustic energy is absorbed by orifices located within a thin plate (i. e. a perforated liner). The perforated liner, which incorporates orifices of length to diameter ratios of 0. 2, is supplied with flow from a passage. This enables the liner {{to be subject to}} a flow that grazes the upstream <b>side</b> of each <b>liner</b> orifice. Flow can also pass through each orifice to create a bias flow. Hence the liner can be subjected to a range of grazing and bias flow combinations. Two types of liners were investigated which incorporated either simple plain or ‘skewed’ orifices. For the mean flow field, data is presented which shows that the mean discharge coefficient of each liner is determined by the grazing to bias flow velocity ratio. In addition, measurements of the unsteady flow field through each liner were also undertaken and mainly presented in terms of the measured admittance. For a given liner geometry, the admittance values were found to be comparable for a given Strouhal number (with the exception of the lowest bias to grazing flow velocity ratio tested) which has also been noted by other authors. The paper shows that {{this is consistent with the}} unsteady orifice flow being associated with variations in both the velocity and the area of the vena contracta downstream of each orifice. These same basic characteristics were observed for both of the liner geometries tested. This provides a relatively simple means of predicting the acoustic liner characteristics over the specified operating range...|$|R
40|$|Gas turbine combustors have at {{industrial}} scale a thermal power released by combustion of 1 to 400 MW. As the flames in these combustors are very turbulent, the combustion generates {{high levels of}} thermo acoustic noise. Of crucial importance for {{the operation of the}} engine is not the noise emitted, but its structural integrity. This may be at hazard when the combustor liner starts to vibrate in a mode linked to the thermo acoustic noise. This is even more likely when the combustion noise changes to an unstable closed loop feed back system. Another dangerous situation may arise when there is a two way interaction between the combustion oscillations and the liner vibration. For these reasons the understanding of transient combustion and its coupling with wall vibration in a typical gas turbine combustion chamber is of prime interest. This phenomenon is investigated in the project FLUISTCOM in both experimental and numerical work. In the project a liner was designed with a thin, flexible section with a significant amplitude response on changes in the pressure field caused by the combustion oscillations. Numerical calculations of eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes were performed, followed by transient numerical calculations of the transient combusting flow within the combustion chamber with the use of CFX-ANSYS. The flame investigated was a 1. 5 bar, 150 kW premixed natural gas flame. Solutions for the pressure field obtained during numerical computations of the combustor flow were collected and implemented in the structural code (Ansys) as surface loads on the <b>liner</b> <b>side.</b> Results show the one way response of the liner structure {{as a result of the}} transient pressure generated by the combustion of the gas flow. The paper will present the predicted results on the combustion field, the accompanying oscillating pressure field, and the induced structural vibration of the combustor liner as predicted by the finite element structural code...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{management}} {{is an essential}} part of combustor design, as operating temperatures within the combustor generally exceed safe working temperatures of the materials employed in its construction. Two principal methods used to manage this heat are impingement and film cooling. Impingement heat transfer refers to jets of impinging fluid delivered by orifices integrated into internal structures in order to remove undesired heat. This mode of heat transfer has a relatively high effectiveness, making it an attractive method of heat management. As such, a considerable number of studies have been done on the subject providing a substantial body of useful knowledge. However, there are innovative cooling configurations being used in gas turbines which generate compressibility and temperature ratio effects on heat transfer which are currently unexplored. Presented here are data showing that these effects have a significant impact on heat transfer and new correlations are presented to account for temperature ratio and Mach number effects for a range of conditions. These findings are significant and can be applied to impinging flows in other areas of a gas turbine engine such as turbine blades and vanes. Film cooling refers to the injection of coolant onto a surface through an array of sharply angled holes. This is done in a manner that allows the coolant to remain close to the surface where it provides an insulating layer between the hot gas freestream and the cooler surface. In order to improve turbine efficiency, research efforts in film cooling are directed at reducing film cooling flow without decreasing turbine inlet temperatures. Both impingement cooling and film cooling are heavily utilized in combustor liners. Frequently, cooling air first impinges against the back <b>side</b> of the <b>liner,</b> then the spent impingement fluid passes through film cooling holes. This arrangement combines the convective heat transfer of the impinging jets convection as the coolant passes through the film cooling holes and the benefits that come from having a thin film of cool air between the combustor wall and the combustion products. In order to improve the understanding of internal cooling in gas turbine engines, the influence of previously unexplored physical parameters such as compressible flow effects and temperature ratio in impingement flows and variable blowing ratio in a film cooling array must be examined. Prior to this work, there existed in the available literature only an extremely limited exploration of compressibility effects in impingement heat transfer and the results of separately examining the effects of Mach number and Reynolds number. The film cooling literature provides no information for a full array of film cooling holes along a contraction at high blowing ratios. Exploring these effects and conditions adds to the body of available data and allows the validation of numerical predictions. This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|R
