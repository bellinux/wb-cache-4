40|$|In {{wastewater}} disposal the unsolved organic and mineral substances that {{are contained in}} the wastewater play a decisive role. In all surveys these solids have not been given sufficient attention, although they significantly influence the operation and service life of drainage systems by forming deposits. In the future, these effects are likely to intensify due to the {{turning away from the}} common practice of draining all stromwater flows that occur on settlement and traffic areas quickly and to the greatest possible extent. The measures taken to decentrally retain or seep stormwater namely have more or less strong influence on the drainage and self-cleaning capacity of a sewer system and thus on the formation of deposits. Furthermore, mineral solids in the wastewater deserve special attention when looking at water pollution caused by organic micro elements as many of these micro pollutants preferably accumulate on solid particles and thus enter bodies of water via discharges from sewer systens. In the face of the importance of mineral solids, special efforts to prevent their entry into drainage systems appear necessary. Based on an analysis of the solids' origin, composition and quantity contained in the wastewater road gullies offer the greatest potential to retain solids. As results of the performed laboratory and in-situ tests as well as a weak point analysis have shown, road gullies that are standardised in DIN 4052 and have been used so far fulfill their function of retaining solids only to a very insufficient level. Here, their productivity is heavily influenced by the practiced cleaning intervals. In order to optimise the retention of solids, the separative road gully (SSA), which is presented in the survey at hand, was developed. It is based on the concept of mechanically separating the solids that are contained in the road gully from the liquid phase. A special system ensures that this is carried out in the most concentrated way and in three steps. In addition, it prevents retained solids from being mobilised irrespenctive of the duration and intensity of precipitation events. The tests and optimisation of the constructive and hydraulic approaches as well as the verification of the functionality and efficiency of the SSA were performed within the scope of laboratory test and in-situ tests over several years. Here, as a comparison conventional road gullies were also taken into account. Improvements in the retention of solids by the SSA arose without utilising its capacities under test conditions. Compared to road gullies that comprise a <b>sediment</b> <b>chamber</b> the performance increased by around 32 % and compared to road gullies with floor outlet even up to 81 %. In this way for the SSA the verification of suitability could be provided as a decentral measure to reduce solid entry into sewer systems. An area-wide conversion of conventional road gullies to the SSA also appears economically interesting in the medium term as the cleaning costs for sewer systems could be significantly reduced...|$|E
40|$|In {{in vitro}} estuarine water and <b>sediment</b> <b>chambers,</b> the {{survival}} of Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli was determined by plate counting and direct counting techniques. V. cholerae strains included environmental, clinical, and serotype O 1 and non-O 1 isolates, whereas E. coli strains included ATCC 25922 and a freshly cultured human isolate. Recovery of V. cholerae varied significantly with incubation temperature. Growth and extended periods of survival occurred in sterile sediments, sterile waters, and nonsterile waters, but not in nonsterile sediments. In contrast to V. cholerae, viable cells of E. coli decreased rapidly in both sterile and nonsterile estuarine waters. Direct counts revealed that E. coli cells were intact in the estuarine water, but attempts to resuscitate them were unsuccessful. The data suggest that V. cholerae survives better in estuarine waters than E. coli. The results may explain the recent observations that V. cholerae levels do not correlate well with fecal coliform concentrations in estuarine waters. Furthermore, the results add increasing {{evidence to support the}} theory that V. cholerae is an autochthonous bacterium in estuaries...|$|R

The inflowing artificial seawater and ouflowing seawater were analyzed for {{dissolved organic carbon}} and nitrogen (DOC and DON), total acid-hydrolyzable amino acids (THAA), dissolved free amino acids (DFAA), urea, NH 4, NO 3, �CO 2, and O 2 during the 33 d of incubation. Sediment profiles of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, sediment acid-hydrolyzable amino acids, DON, DFAA, urea, NH 4 and the turnover rate of urea were measured at four different times during the 33 d of incubation. There was an immediate increase in carbon oxidation and the effluxes of DOC, DON, and NH 4 after the addition of eelgrass leaves to the sediment surface. During the course of incubation, 24. 3 % of the DON efflux was identified as acid-hydrolyzable amino acids, dissolved free amino acids, and urea in the chambers with eelgrass addition, whereas these compounds accounted for 33. 8 % of the DON efflux in the control chambers. There were indications of a stimulated bacterial growth on the eelgrass leaves during the first 7 d after leaf addition that was measured as an increase in acid-hydrolyzable amino acids.

40|$|An active {{debate has}} been {{underway}} on the magnitude and duration of carbon (C) emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs, yet {{little attention has been}} paid to stochastic C emissions from reservoir sediments during extreme climatic events. A rare opportunity for field measurements of CO 2 efflux from a hydroelectric reservoir in Korea during an extreme drought event was used to examine how prolonged droughts can affect microbial organic matter processing and the release of CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O from exposed <b>sediments.</b> <b>Chamber</b> measurements of CO 2 efflux along an exposed sediment transect, combined with high-frequency continuous sensor measurements of the partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO(2)) in the reservoir surface water, exhibited extraordinary pulses of CO 2 from exposed sediments and the turbulent inflowing water in contrast to a small CO 2 sink in the main water body of the reservoir and a low efflux of CO 2 from the flooded sediment. Significant increases in the production of CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O observed in a laboratory incubation of sediments, together with enhanced activities of phenol oxidase and three hydrolases, indicate a temporary activation of microbial organic matter processing in the drying sediment.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{physical}} heterogeneity on the electrokinetic (EK) transport of nitrate, an electron acceptor frequently used for anaerobic biodegradation, was investigated experimentally within saturated granular porous media comprising {{two layers of}} high and low hydraulic conductivity (K) material. Two hypotheses were tested: firstly, that the presence of layered physical heterogeneity will generate non-uniformities in the electric field; and secondly that this would create non-uniform electromigration of ions resulting in an additional nitrate flux into the lower-K layer. Experiments were conducted in bench-top test cells that contained electrode and <b>sediment</b> <b>chambers.</b> An aqueous nitrate solution (0, 0. 1, 1 and 5 g-NO 3 L− 1) was added at the cathode and the experiments run with an idealised mixture of glass beads and kaolinite, and natural sediment and kaolinite. A constant current (1. 6 Am− 2) was applied in all experiments. Results showed elevated voltage differences between layers in heterogeneous experiments compared to equivalent homogenous experiments. Furthermore, nitrate concentrations are elevated in the low-K material in heterogeneous compared with homogeneous systems. Using predicted values this is shown to be a function of a transverse flux associated with the voltage difference between layers. The importance of this phenomena at field scale for delivery of an amendment (i. e., electron acceptor, donor or nutrient) by EK for bioremediation is presented in an electron balance model. Overall, this research establishes and quantifies a previously unreported important phenomenon in the electrokinetic transport literature that enhance the application of this technology for bioremediation of contaminated aquifers...|$|R

However, no study to date has evaluated the importance of the biodiversity of benthic invertebrate bioturbators to the spatial patterns {{of sediment}} CH 4 concentration ([CH 4]). Here we conducted a laboratorial experiment to test the following predictions: (1) Bioturbator species richness will reduce the sediment [CH 4]; (2) individual bioturbator species (i. e. species composition) will have different effects on sediment [CH 4]; (3) and both the effects of bioturbator species richness and composition on sediment [CH 4] will be dependent on sediment depth. METHODS: We manipulated the number and composition of three functional divergent benthic invertebrate bioturbators species that are widespread in South Atlantic coastal lagoons, in laboratorial <b>sediment</b> <b>chambers</b> containing the <b>sediment</b> and water of an urban impacted coastal lagoon RESULTS: Bioturbator species richness had no overall significant effect on sediment [CH 4] when comparisons of sediment [CH 4] were made among species richness levels. However, bioturbator species richness significantly reduced sediment [CH 4] when species richness levels were compared to the control (defaunated treatments), but this effect was significant only at the deepest sediment layer. Furthermore, bioturbator species composition had significant, but distinct effects on the patterns of reduction in sediment [CH 4], depending on the sediment depth and the bioturbator species. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that both the number and composition of bioturbator species are important to determine the effects of benthic bioturbators on spatial patterns of sediment [CH 4], but the strength of these effects depend on species traits that determine interspecific interactions strength across the sediment vertical niche space...|$|R

40|$|Sampling, {{analysis}} and counting of phytoplankton has been undertaken in European lakes {{for more than}} 100 years (Apstein 1892, Lauterborn 1896, Lemmermann 1903, Woloszynska 1912, Nygaard 1949). Since this early period of pioneers, there has been progress in the methods used to sample, fix, store and analyse phytoplankton. The aim of the deliverable D 3. 1 - 4 is to select, harmonize and recommend the most optimal method {{as a basis for}} lake assessment. We do not report and review the huge number of European national methods or other published manuals for phytoplankton sampling and analysis that are available. An agreement on a proper sampling procedure is not trivial for lake phytoplankton. In the early 20 th century, sampling was carried out using plankton nets. An unconcentrated sample without any pre-screening is required for quantitative phytoplankton analysis, for which various water samplers were developed. Sampling of distinct water depths or an integral sample of the euphotic zone affects the choice of the sampler and sampling procedure. The widely accepted method to quantify algal numbers together with species determination was developed by Utermöhl (1958), who proposed the counting technique using <b>sediment</b> <b>chambers</b> and inverse microscopy. This is the basis for the recently agreed CEN standard “Water quality - Guidance standard on the enumeration of phytoplankton using inverted microscopy (Utermöhl technique) ” (CEN 15204, 2006). This CEN standard does not cover the sampling procedure or the calculation of biovolumes for phytoplankton species, although Rott (1981), Hillebrand et al (1999) and Pohlmann & Friedrich (2001) have contributed advice on how to calculate taxa biovolumes effectively. Willén (1976) suggested a simplified counting method, when counting 60 individuals of each species. For the Scandinavian region an agreed phytoplankton sampling and counting manual was compiled, which has been in use for about 20 years (Olrik et al. 1998, Blomqvist & Herlitz 1998). It is very unfortunate that no European guidance on sampling of phytoplankton in lakes was agreed before the phytoplankton assessment methods for the EU-WFD were developed and intercalibrated by Member States. In 2008 an initiative by the European Commission (Mandate M 424) for two draft CEN standards on sampling in freshwaters and on calculation of phytoplankton biovolume was unfortunately delayed by administrative difficulties. Recently a grant agreement was signed between the Commission and DIN (German Institute for Standardization) in January 2012 to develop these standards. We believe this WISER guidance document can usefully contribute to these up-coming standards. ...|$|R
40|$|Baffle {{boxes are}} {{concrete}} or fiberglass structures containing {{a series of}} <b>sediment</b> settling <b>chambers</b> separated by baffles. The primary function of baffle boxes is to remove sediment, suspended particles, and associated pollutants from storm water. Baffle boxes may also contain trash screens or skimmers to capture larger materials, trash, and floatables. Baffle boxes are located either in-line or {{at the end of}} storm pipes. Figure 1 shows a typical baffle box design. The use of baffle boxes for pollutant removal is based on the concept of slowing the flow velocity through the box, thereby allowing solids and associated pollutants to settle {{to the bottom of the}} box. Storm water enters the box and begins to fill the first chamber. As water encounters the baffles, flow velocity decreases, allowing particles with a settling velocity greater than the horizontal flow velocity to settle to the bottom of the box. In addition to decreasing flow velocities, the baffles impede particle movement. As suspended solids strike the baffles they begin to settle. Larger particles usually settle out first and accumulate in the first chambers while smaller particles usually settle out in subsequent chambers. MANHOLES MANHOLE...|$|R

A vuggy structure formed in the sand; these small cavities or vuggs were precursors to the development of gas-driven fractures during depressurization under a constant effective stress boundary condition. We define the critical fines fraction as the clay-to-sand mass ratio when clays fill the pore space in the sand. Fines migration, clogging, vugs, and gas-driven fracture formation developed even when the fines content was significantly lower than the critical fines fraction. These results show the importance of fines in gas production from hydrate-bearing sediments, even when the fines content is relatively low. 1...|$|R

No significant differences in egg viability were detected between treatments, but more species hatched from sediment that remained in cold storage.

Such storage does, however, introduce the possibility of CO 2 leakage and interaction with marine fauna. It is therefore important to obtain knowledge on possible effects of CO 2 that is introduced to the sea floor. Results from experiments on environmental effects of enhanced concentrations of CO 2 at the sediment/water interface are presented. The {{key part of the}} project was the Japanese Benthic Chamber system (BC) developed to perform experiments with CO 2 in sedimentary environments in situ. The BC is equipped with chambers which enclose sections of the sea floor. Two similar experiments were carried out at 400 m depth in Storfjorden, Norway in September, 2005. The pCO 2 exposures in the water above the <b>sediment</b> in the <b>chambers</b> were programmed to maintain levels of approximately 5, 000 µatm (pH= 7. 0) and 20, 000 µatm (pH= 6. 3) respectively in two experimental chambers.

Two types of Calmar benthic chambers were deployed, either directly set into the <b>sediment</b> (standard Calmar <b>chamber)</b> or fitted with a tank to isolate organisms from the <b>sediment</b> (modified Calmar <b>chamber),</b> to assess gas and solute exchanges in relation to bivalve bed metabolism. Fluxes of oxygen, total carbon dioxide, ammonium and methane were measured. At the site with organic-rich sediments, oxygen consumption by clams measured in situ with the standard benthic chamber was variable (1. 3 - 6. 7 mmol m− 2 h− 1) as was total carbon dioxide production (1 - 9. 6 mmol m− 2 h− 1). The observed gas and solute fluxes were attributed primarily to bivalve respiration (vesicomyids or mytilids), but microbial and geochemical processes in the sediment may be also responsible for some of variations in the deepest stations. The respiration rate of isolated vesicomyids (16. 1 -. 25. 7 µmol g− 1 dry weight h− 1) was always {{lower than that of}} mytilids (33 µmol g− 1 dry weight h− 1).

To quantify potential microbial oil degradation rates at the seafloor, and associated changes in sediment microbial community structure and pore fluid composition, we used a benthic lander system to deploy novel <b>sediment</b> flow-through <b>chambers</b> at a natural hydrocarbon seep in the Gulf of Mexico (at a depth of 1226 m in lease block GC 600) roughly 265 km southwest of the 'Deepwater Horizon' wellhead (at 1500 m depth). Sediment amended with 20 % unweathered crude oil had elevated rates of sulfate reduction {{over the course of}} the 5 -month-long experiment as compared to an unamended control, yielding potential rates of sulfate reduction (600 – 800 mmol m– 2 d– 1) among the highest measured in hydrocarbon-influenced seafloor sediment. Oil amendment also stimulated methane production towards the end of the experiment, and led to slightly higher cell densities without significant changes in microbial community structure, based on 16 S rRNA gene sequence libraries and fatty acid profiles. Assuming a link between sulfate reduction and hydrocarbon degradation, these results suggest that electron acceptor availability may become limiting in heavily oiled deep-sea environments, resulting in minimal degradation of deposited oil. This study provides unique data on seafloor sediment responses to oil deposition, and reveals the value of using observatories to fill the gap in understanding deep-sea microbial processes, especially for ephemeral and stochastic events such as oil spills...|$|R

The silicate fluxes ranged from 0. 24 to 1. 01 mmol m(- 2) day(- 1) and the oxygen fluxes from 9. 3 to 22. 6 mmol m(- 2) day(- 1).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2008. This {{dissertation}} explores two recently recognized pathways {{of organic}} matter supply to marine sediments {{and their impact on}} sedimentary biogeochemistry: The entrapment and decomposition of particulate organic matter in permeable sediments and the resulting nutrient dynamics were investigated with a specially designed experimental laboratory microcosm that allows permeable sediment incubation under controlled physical forcing. Microcosm generated enhanced solute transport rates were roughly proportional to sediment column permeability. Comparison with field observations revealed that the enhanced transport rates induced by the experimental conditions were lower than those observed in the field, and this was also reflected in the enhanced buildup of pore water nutrients relative to concentrations in field sediments. Particulate organic matter and nutrient enrichment experiments, conducted with the microcosm, demonstrated the rapid uptake of both particles and solutes by the permeable sediment column under physical forcing, the rapid decomposition of the removed particles, and the lack of regenerated nutrient build-up. Nutrient enrichment experiments with <b>sediment</b> plug <b>chambers</b> demonstrated the rapid uptake and retention of nutrients by surface permeable sediments, as well as the loss of nitrogen though benthic denitrification in sediment grain microzones. The processing of large organic matter packages on the deepsea floor by deep-sea communities was investigated using natural and experimental whale, kelp and wood falls in the California Borderland Basins region, focusing on their quality and its impact on sedimentary organic enrichment and redox shifts. Labile organic material generated by the processing of whale falls and kelp falls generated substantial pore water sulfide levels in impacted sediment, despite a small organic enrichment signal. In contrast, wood derived material input did not result in sulfidic conditions, despite generating very high organic enrichment in impacted sediments, due to its refractory nature. A constructed model incorporating metazoan processing and dispersal of fragmented material revealed that whale fall processing is characterized by higher rates of tissue removal, organic carbon release, and carbon sedimentation rates than wood fall processing. However, organic carbon release rates, when normalized to fall weight, are similar between the two types of falls, due to differences in their carbon content and in absorption rates during metazoan ingestion.

40|$|Sediments in navigation-dominated {{waterways}} {{are frequently}} contaminated {{with a wide}} range of chemicals and are subject to resuspension events. There is little information documenting whether adverse ecological effects result from these resuspension of contaminated sediments. I studied the mobilization of metals (Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni and Cr) during resuspensions of freshwater and marine sediments and whether or not this resulted in toxicity to organisms. Sediment resuspension events were simulated using <b>sediment</b> flux exposure <b>chambers</b> (SeFEC) to resuspend metal-contaminated sediments from Lake DePue (IL) and two Portsmouth (ME) Naval Shipyard sites. Various resuspension events of environmentally relevant suspended particulate matter concentrations (200 - 1, 000 mg/L) were performed. Short-term resuspension events (4 h) resulted in metal- and sediment-specific mobilization. Toxic effects on organisms were limited (Hyalella azteca and Daphnia magna survival, Neanthes arenaceodentata survival, growth and body burden, Pyrocystis lunula bioluminescence) over both the time period of the exposure and during a 4 to 10 -d post-recovery period. I conclude that sediment resuspension events at relevant suspended particulate matter concentrations do not release large amounts of dissolved metals, most likely due to the oxidation of reduced iron, manganese and amorphous sulfide species and subsequent readsorption to iron and manganese oxides and organic matter, therefore limiting organisms’ exposure and effects. The redeposition of suspended sediments and associated metal speciation changes, from sulfides to oxides, has the potential to increase metal bioavailability and toxicity to sensitive benthic organisms. While the release of dissolved metals are low, resuspension events still pose the risk of causing toxic responses due to mobilization of contaminated sediments...|$|R

In situ regulated and unregulated benthic <b>chambers,</b> <b>sediment</b> cores, and laboratory tank incubations were usedto study early diagenesis of FDOM in coastal marine sediments of the Gullmar Fjord, western Sweden. In the regulated in situ chambers, pH and oxygen werekept at relatively stable levels, while in the unregulated in situ chambers, pH and oxygen were left to decrease as a result of biological activity. FDOM porewaterdistributions and correlation between FDOM and parameters indicating mineralization showed that FDOM was formed in the sediment and should flux across thesediment-water interface. A substantial flux of FDOM was also observed during winter and spring conditions and during anoxic conditions fall. However, no fluxwas observed during oxic conditions fall. Modeling indicated that oxygen penetration depth was deeper during winter than during fall, i. e., the oxygen penetrationdepth increased during fall towards winter values. We suggest that as FeOOH was formed when oxygen penetration depths increased, FDOM was sorbed tonewly formed FeOOH, inhibiting FDOM flux over the sediment-water interface. In addition, at onset of anoxic conditions in the sediment surface layer in fallincubations, FDOM flux from sediment to overlying water increased substantially. Increases in anoxic FDOM fluxes were accompanied by increases in Fe andphosphate fluxes. We suggest that reductively dissolved FeOOH released sorbed FDOM. FDOM released from FeOOH by anoxic conditions was not resorbedwhen oxic conditions were resumed. This could be an effect of higher pH in overlying water as compared with porewater, inhibiting FeOOH sorption of FDOM...|$|R

Hydraulics performance is investigated for design discharge with constant flow. The hydraulic performance of closing of one chamber and operation of remaining chamber with design discharge of power plant is also investigated. Based on water flow computation result, sediment computation was carried out for one settling chamber, proposed, alternative and modifications of proposed layouts. Effect of approach geometry on distribution of <b>sediment</b> on four <b>chambers</b> of settling basin and sediment trap performance were studied by sediment flow simulation.

40|$|Taphonomic {{analysis}} of Lower and Middle Oxfordian ammonites from the Cracow Upland, southern Poland (localities at Podłęże, Zalas, Młynka) revealed differences in ammonite preservation. The studied ammonites, usually termed as {{external and internal}} moulds, show a more complex state of preservation. In the Middle Oxfordian glauconitic marls, ammonites are preserved as internal moulds with neomorphic calcite shells showing relics of the original internal structure. In the Middle Oxfordian platy peloidal limestones, ammonites are preserved mostly as external moulds, without septal suture, however under microscope might show relics of internal whorls and septa and/or subtle differences in <b>sediment</b> filling phragmocone <b>chambers.</b> In sponge–microbial bioherms and biostromes, ammonite internal moulds have shells, {{which in contrast to}} ammonites from glauconitic marls are not strictly neomorphic ones, but originated by shell dissolution and subsequent filling of moldic porosity by calcite cement. In sponge–microbial nodular limestones, the ammonites are strongly deformed and the outer wall is usually removed by dissolution under pressure. Other important taphonomic differences include the rate of compaction (highest in platy limestones), sedimentary infillings, microborings, encrustations and preservation of siphuncular tubes. The majority of the ammonites appear to be phragmocones; aptychi in all facies are rare. Siphuncular tubes are fossilized exclusively in oppeliids, only in specimens from glauconitic marls and platy limestones, although their other taphonomic attributes are different. Tubes seem to have fossilized due to microbially mediated phosphatization that could be favoured by a set of parameters which operated rather at the scale of ammonoid carcasses: closed, poorly oxygenated conditions, and reduced pH. Taphonomic processes were controlled by the sedimentary environment (fragmentation, sedimentary filling, phosphatization of siphuncular tubes), as well as by early and late diagenesis (neomorphic transformation, dissolution, cementation, compaction) influenced by lithology...|$|R
40|$|Ucides cordatus is an {{abundant}} mangrove crab in Brazil constructing burrows {{of up to}} 2 m depth. Sediment around burrows may oxidize during low tides. This increase in sediment-air contact area may enhance carbon degradation processes. We hypothesized that 1) the sediment CO 2 efflux rate is greater with burrows than without and 2) the reduction potential in radial profiles in the sediment surrounding the burrows decreases gradually, until approximating non-bioturbated conditions. Sampling was conducted during the North Brazilian wet season at neap tides. CO 2 efflux rates of inhabited burrows and plain sediment were measured with a CO 2 /H 2 O gas analyzer connected to a respiration <b>chamber.</b> <b>Sediment</b> redox potential, pH and temperature were measured in the sediment surrounding the burrows at horizontal distances of 2, 5, 8 and 15 cm at four sediment depths (1, 10, 30 and 50 cm) and rH values were calculated. Sediment cores (50 cm length) were taken to measure the same parameters for plain sediment. CO 2 efflux rates of plain sediment and individual crab burrows with entrance diameters of 7 cm were 0. 7 - 1. 3 µmol m(- 2) s(- 1) and 0. 2 - 0. 4 µmol burrows(- 1) s(- 1), respectively. CO 2 released from a Rhizophora mangle dominated forest {{with an average of}} 1. 7 U. cordatus burrows(- 1) m(- 2) yielded 1. 0 - 1. 7 µmol m(- 2) s(- 1), depending on the month and burrow entrance diameter. Laboratory experiments revealed that 20 - 60 % of the CO 2 released by burrows originated from crab respiration. Temporal changes in the reduction potential in the sediment surrounding the burrows did not influence the CO 2 release from burrows. More oxidized conditions of plain sediment over time may explain the increase in CO 2 release {{until the end of the}} wet season. CO 2 released by U. cordatus and their burrows may be a significant pathway of CO 2 export from mangrove sediments and should be considered in mangrove carbon budget estimates...|$|R
40|$|Particles sinking {{out of the}} {{euphotic}} zone are important vehicles of carbon export from the surface ocean. Most of the particles produce heavier aggregates by coagulating with each other before they sink. We implemented an aggregation model into the biogeochemical model of Regional Oceanic Modelling System (ROMS) to simulate the distribution of particles {{in the water column}} and their downward transport in the Northwest African upwelling region. Accompanying settling <b>chamber,</b> <b>sediment</b> trap and particle camera measurements provide data for model validation. In situ aggregate settling velocities measured by the settling chamber were around 55 m d&# 8722; 1. Aggregate sizes recorded by the particle camera hardly exceeded 1 mm. The model is based on a continuous size spectrum of aggregates, characterised by the prognostic aggregate mass and aggregate number concentration. Phytoplankton and detritus make up the aggregation pool, which has an averaged, prognostic and size dependent sinking. Model experiments were performed with dense and porous approximations of aggregates with varying maximum aggregate size and stickiness {{as well as with the}} inclusion of a disaggregation term. Similar surface productivity in all experiments has been generated in order to find the best combination of parameters that produce measured deep water fluxes. Although the experiments failed to represent surface particle number spectra, in the deep water some of them gave very similar slope and spectrum range as the particle camera observations.

40|$|The fate of {{trace metals}} in {{contaminated}} coastal sediments is poorly understood, yet critical for effective coastal management. The {{aim of this}} thesis is to investigate and quantify the mechanisms leading {{to the release of}} silver, lead and copper across the sediment-water interface. Two contrasting sites were investigated, a heavily contaminated site in Boston Harbor and a less impacted, offshore site in Massachusetts Bay. High-resolution porewater and solid phase samples were collected in each season to determine the diagenetic cycles and chemistry controlling the fate of these metals. The trace metals are scavenged by iron oxyhydroxides and released to the porewaters when these oxides are reduced. At the strongly reducing site in Boston Harbor, there is seasonal transfer of trace metals from oxide phases in winter, to sulfides phase in summer. At the Massachusetts Bay site, {{due to the lack of}} sulfide, the metals are focused into the surface oxide layer, giving a solid phase enrichment. There is a diffusive flux of copper to the water column throughout the year, while silver is released only in winter. Lead is strongly scavenged and is rarely released to the overlying waters. (cont.) Analysis of reduced sulfur compounds in the porewaters has shown that there is also a significant flux of these strong ligands to the overlying waters. Polysulfide species enhance the solubility of copper within the porewaters. Sediment resuspension fluxes were quantified using an erosion <b>chamber.</b> <b>Sediment</b> resuspension leads to enhanced release of dissolved metals and is especially important in redistributing contaminants as the first particles to be eroded are enriched in trace metals. The total release of dissolved metals from the sediments by diffusion and sediment resuspension is estimated to be 60 % and 10 % of the riverine flux for copper and lead respectively. With continued pollution control reducing the discharge of metals from other sources, the benthic release of metals will become increasingly important terms in the metal budget of Boston Harbor. by Linda H.

40|$|Suspension-feeding {{bivalves}} produce biodeposits (faeces and pseudofaeces) {{that have}} much higher sinking velocities than their constituent particles. Consequently they cause sedimentation {{of material that}} might otherwise not be deposited. The benthic remineralisation of biodeposits increases sediment oxygen demand and nutrient regeneration, thus enhancing the benthic-pelagic coupling of nearshore ecosystems. In New Zealand the mussel Perna canaliculus has a high natural abundance and is also intensively cultured. This thesis examines the dispersal and remineralisation characteristics of mussel P. canaliculus biodeposits and the impacts of sedimentation from a mussel farm in the Firth of Thames on sediment biogeochemistry by combining laboratory, field and modelling studies. Dispersal characteristics were examined in the laboratory by measuring sinking velocities and erosion thresholds of biodeposits produced by mussels of a wide size range fed three experimental diets. The results show that biodeposit dispersal {{is a function of}} mussel diet and size and thus could differ significantly between locations and seasons. Estimates of dispersal distances based on these results demonstrated that the initial dispersal of biodeposits produced by cultured mussels is not far. Depending on the hydrodynamic conditions, secondary dispersal via resuspension potentially plays a more important role in the dispersal of biodeposits from mussel farms than initial dispersal and almost certainly serves as the major means of transport of biodeposits from natural mussel beds. Biodeposit mineralisation was studied by incubating coastal sediments with added biodeposits and measuring oxygen and nutrient fluxes as well as sediment characteristics over an 11 d period. Sediment oxygen consumption and ammonium release increased immediately after biodeposit addition and remained elevated compared to control cores without additions for the incubation period. A biodeposit decay rate (0. 16 d- 1) was calculated by fitting a first-order G model to the observed increase in oxygen consumption. This rate is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than published decay rates of coastal sediments without organic enrichment or plant material. Nutrient fluxes during the incubation period illustrated that biodeposit remineralisation alters the stoichiometry of the nutrients released from the sediments which may potentially be more significant than the changes of the individual fluxes. To determine the impact of a mussel farm in the Firth of Thames I measured sediment oxygen and nutrient fluxes by deploying benthic <b>chambers,</b> <b>sediment</b> characteristics by collecting sediment cores and sedimentation rates by deploying sediment traps in four seasons. Oxygen consumption and sediment nutrient release rates were generally higher under the farm compared to a reference site, demonstrating the typical response to increased organic input. Unusually low nitrogen release rates measured in summer may indicate enhanced denitrification under the farm. A simple budget demonstrated the importance of benthic nutrient regeneration in maintaining primary production in this region and that mussel culture can lead to a redistribution of nutrients. This study showed that site-specific hydrodynamic and biogeochemical conditions have {{to be taken into account}} when planning new mussel farms to prevent excessive modifications of nutrient dynamics. Results of the laboratory and field studies conducted in this thesis were used to parameterise, calibrate and validate models of mussel biodeposit dispersal and remineralisation. A particle tracking model showed that the maximum initial dispersal of faecal pellets from the mussel farm is approximately 300 m and that pellets can be transported several times this distance via resuspension. The remineralisation model was able to simulate the increased nitrogen fluxes from the sediments well and highlighted the need for thorough calibration and parameterisation of the model. This thesis contributed to the current understanding of the ecosystem impacts of mussel culture and provided numerical models and model parameters that will assist in the assessment of mussel culture sustainability and the contribution of mussels to the nutrient cycling in nearshore ecosystems...|$|R
