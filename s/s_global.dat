40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays on diversification benefits, return characteristics, {{and the performance of}} U. <b>S.</b> -based <b>global</b> government bond mutual funds. The first essay examines: (i) the performance of U. <b>S.</b> -based <b>global</b> government bond funds, (ii) the benefits of inclusion of U. <b>S.</b> -based <b>global</b> government bond funds in existing portfolios, (iii) the persistence of risk-adjusted performance of global bond funds, (iv) the influence of fund characteristics on performance, and (v) the return seasonality of global bond funds. The second essay studies: (i) the usefulness of style analysis on global bond funds, (ii) the style-adjusted performance of U. <b>S.</b> -based <b>global</b> bond funds, and (iii) the investment behavior of global bond fund managers. This study is important because it is the first to provide a complete study of diversification benefits, return characteristics, and style-adjusted performance measurement and performance evaluation of a large sample of U. <b>S.</b> -based <b>global</b> government bond funds. It is also first in casting U. <b>S.</b> -based <b>global</b> government bond funds investment as an alternative investment to U. S. domestic bond funds. The empirical results of this study will greatly benefit individual investors who consider investing in U. S. bond fund markets or consider U. <b>S.</b> -based <b>global</b> government bond funds as an addition or an alternative to U. S. domestic bond funds. This study also contributes significantly to the scarce literature of style-adjusted performance measurement and evaluations of the global government bond fund industry. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{predecessor}} {{companies of}} <b>S</b> <b>Global</b> have history dating to 1888, when James H. McGraw purchased the American Journal of Railway Appliances. He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing The McGraw Publishing Company in 1899. John A. Hill had also produced several technical and trade publications and in 1902 formed his own business, The Hill Publishing Company. In 1909 both men, having known each other's interests, agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into The McGraw-Hill Book Company. John Hill served as President, with James McGraw as Vice-President. In 1917, the remaining parts of each business were merged into The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company In 1986, McGraw-Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the United States' largest publisher of educational material. The buyout made McGraw-Hill the largest educational publisher in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Under Brownback, in January 2013, the [...] "largest tax cut" [...] in Kansas {{state history}} took effect. He cut {{the income tax}} rate and {{eliminated}} some corporate taxes. He added a penny to the sales tax to offset the loss to state revenues but that was inadequate. Deficits mounted. By April, Brownback wanted to cut taxes even again. He made more cuts to education and some state services to offset lost revenue. The economic growth that he anticipated never materialized. Brownback {{argued that it was}} because of [...] "low wheat and oil prices and a downturn in aircraft sales."

2500|$|In September 2016, Wells Fargo {{was issued}} a {{combined}} total of $185 {{million in fines}} for creating over 1.5 million checking and savings accounts and 500,000 credit cards that its customers never authorized. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued $100 million in fines, {{the largest in the}} agency's five-year history, along with $50 million in fines from the City and County of Los Angeles, and $35 million in fines from the Office of Comptroller of the Currency. The scandal was caused by an incentive-compensation program for employees to create new accounts. It led to the firing of nearly 5,300 employees and $5 million being set aside for customer refunds on fees for accounts the customers never wanted. Carrie Tolstedt, who headed the department, retired in July 2016 and received $124.6 million in stock, options, and restricted Wells Fargo shares as a retirement package. On October 12, 2016, John Stumpf, the then Chairman and CEO, announced that he would be retiring amidst the controversies involving his company. It was announced by Wells Fargo that President and Chief Operating Officer Timothy J. Sloan would succeed, effective immediately. [...] Following the scandal, applications for credit cards and checking accounts at the bank plummeted dramatically. [...] In response to the event, the Better Business Bureau dropped accreditation of the bank, <b>S</b> <b>Global</b> Ratings lowered its outlook for Wells Fargo to negative from stable, and several states and cities across the US ended business relations with the company. [...] An investigation by the Wells Fargo board of directors, the report of which was released in April 2017, primarily blamed Stumpf, whom it said had not responded to evidence of wrongdoing in the consumer services division, and Tolstedt, who was said to have knowingly set impossible sales goals and refused to respond when subordinates disagreed with them. The board chose to use a clawback clause in the retirement contracts of Stumpf and Tolstedt to recover $75 million worth of cash and stock from the former executives.|$|E
