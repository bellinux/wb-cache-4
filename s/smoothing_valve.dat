40|$|A new {{uncommon}} epilithic diatom, Eunotia relicta sp. nov., {{is described}} {{from a small}} oligotrophic, acidic stream in the Chapada Diamantina region, northeast Brazil. Eunotia relicta is a typical eunotioid form with a pronounced arch on the dorsal side of the valve mainly in smaller valves. Contrary to most Eunotia species, Eunotia relicta does not possess rectangular frustules in girdle view. Until now, this characteristic was only observed in a few species such as E. charliereimeri Edlund & Brant, E. sarraceniae E. E. Gaiser & J. R.

Some interesting morphological features of the new species are broad copulae on the dorsal side, an inconspicuous single conical spine on the valve face near the margin at both poles, and the irregularly thickened interstriae. Moreover, each valve has irregular projections at the dorsal valve face margin/mantle juncture and up to three rimoportulae per valve located on the mantle.

Altogether 10 taxa of molluscs and 8 taxa of ostracods were identified in the examined deposits, with total amounts of 768 and 2872 individuals, respectively. The fauna was investigated with palaeoecological purpose and allowed for preliminary reconstruction of sedimentary environment in the lake. The occurrence of Valvata nilotica Jickeli, 1874 and Gomphocythere sp. in {{the lower part of the}} core and a low proportion of carapaces (2. 4 - 28 %) indicated freshwater and higher-energy conditions, respectively. Rapid expansion of Cyprideis torosa (Jones, 1850) at a depth of 18 m could point to very short saline episode in the lake. The increase in salinity and drop of water level were evidenced in the uppermost part of the core (4 - 3. 5 m), when the lake was dominated by Hydrobia ventrosa (Montagu, 1803), Cerastoderma glaucum (Poiret, 1789) and C. torosa.

The published article is copyrighted by the American Society of Parasitologists and can be found at: [URL] myxozoan species were observed in the kidney of topsmelt, Atherinops affinis, during a survey of parasites of estuarine fishes in the Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve, California. Fish collected on 3 dates in 2012 and 2013 were sectioned and examined histologically. Large extrasporogonic stages occurred in the renal interstitium of several fish from the first 2 collections (5 / 8, 11 / 20, respectively) and, in some fish, these replaced over 80 % of the kidney. In addition, presporogonic and polysporogonic stages occurred in the lumen of the renal tubules, collecting ducts, and mesonephric ducts. The latter contained subspherical spores with up to 4 polar capsules, consistent with the genus Chloromyxum. For the third collection (15 May 2013, n = 30), we portioned kidneys for examination by histology, wet mount, and DNA extraction for small subunit ribosomal (SSU rDNA) gene sequencing. Histology showed the large extrasporogonic forms in the kidney interstitium of 3 fish and showed 2 other fish with subspherical myxospores in the lumen of the renal tubules with <b>smooth</b> <b>valves</b> and 2 spherical polar capsules consistent with the genus Sphaerospora. Chloromyxum-type myxospores were observed in the renal tubules of 1 fish by wet mount. Sequencing of the kidney tissue from this fish yielded a partial SSU rDNA sequence of 1, 769 base pairs (bp). Phylogenetic reconstruction suggested this organism to be a novel species of Chloromyxum, most similar to Chloromyxum careni (84 % similarity). In addition, subspherical myxospores with <b>smooth</b> <b>valves</b> and 2 spherical polar capsules consistent with the genus Sphaerospora were observed in wet mounts of 2 fish. Sequencing of the kidney tissue from 1 fish yielded a partial SSU rDNA sequence of 1, 937 bp. Phylogenetic reconstruction suggests this organism to be a novel species of Sphaerospora most closely related to Sphaerospora epinepheli (93 %). We conclude that these organisms represent novel species of the genera Chloromyxum and Sphaerospora based on host, location, and SSU rDNA sequence. We further conclude that the formation of large, histozoic extrasporogonic stages in the renal interstitium represents developmental stages of Chloromyxum species for the following reasons: (1) Large extrasporogonic stages were only observed in fish with Chloromyxum-type spores developing within the renal tubules, (2) a DNA sequence consistent with the Chloromyxum sp. was only detected in fish with the large extrasporogonic stages, and (3) several Sphaerospora species have extrasporogonic forms, but they are considerably smaller and are composed of far fewer cells...|$|R

5000|$|In species {{which have}} a veliger or {{swimming}} larval stage which hatches out of egg capsules (uncommon in bivalves), there are two parts to the prodissoconch. The {{first part of the}} prodissoconch (which is formed when the larva is still within the embryonic egg capsule) is called prodissoconch I, while the part that is formed after the larva has hatched is called prodissoconch II. There is often different sculpture or ornamentation on prodissoconch I compared with prodissoconch II, and this can be distinguished under the microscope. [...] The prodissoconch I valves of the larval bivalve mollusc are thin, smooth and translucent, and generally appear during the first 24 hours of life. <b>Smooth</b> <b>valves</b> continue to grow symmetrically and a gently sloping umbo projects {{from the middle of the}} hinge line. The prodissoconch II valves are secreted onto the prodissoconch I valves by the edge of the mantle and are still smooth but have faint microsculpture. Following metamorphosis the bivalve larvae (known as a veliger) develop a foot and the velum (or cilia) is reabsorbed and lost. After metamorphosis there is a distinct line where the prodissoconch II stage ends and the part of the valves known as the dissoconch begins and the bivalve mollusk begins its adult sessile existence. [...] During metamorphosis, the veliger, depending on species, may secrete an attachment structure called a byssus that anchors it to the substratum. Some species spend considerable time searching for an ideal habitat before metamorphosing, but others may settle on the nearest suitable substrate.|$|R

40|$|In {{traditional}} {{internal combustion}} engines, a camshaft acts on the valve stems {{to open and}} close the valves. Valve timing is fixed relative to piston position. On the other hand, if a valve is flexibly controlled by a variable valve actuation (VVA) system, we can achieve significant improvements in fuel efficiency, engine performance, and emissions. One of the most advanced variable valve actuation systems is the VVA operated by an electromechanical actuator without a camshaft, the so-called bi-positional electromechanical valve drive (EMVD). Existing EMVDs characteristically use a spring to provide the required mechanical power for operating a valve. The use of a spring provides many benefits {{to the design of}} the system, but it also results in difficult design challenges. The large holding force against the spring at the ends of the stroke suggests the use of a normal-force electromagnetic actuator, which, from a servomechanical point of view, is considerably inferior to a shear-force actuator. Furthermore, the large holding force generates a large jerk at {{the beginning and the end}} of a stroke and makes it difficult to achieve soft valve landing. An innovative electromechanical valve drive (EMVD) design is proposed, which incorporates a nonlinear mechanical transformer and a shear-force actuator. This allows not only fast but also <b>smooth</b> <b>valve</b> motion, almost zero seating velocity, zero holding power, and improved control with acceptable electric power. This proposed concept is modeled, analyzed, simulated, designed, and implemented. Experimental results show the beneficial features of the promising proposed concept. by Woo Sok Chang. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|ObjectiveIn {{aortic valve}} {{regurgitation}} and aortic dilatation, {{preservation of the}} aortic valve is possible by means of root remodeling (Yacoub procedure) or valve reimplantation (David procedure). In vivo studies suggest that reimplantation might substantially influence aortic valve-motion characteristics. Evaluation of aortic valve movement in vivo, however, is technically limited and is difficult to standardize. We evaluated the aortic valve-motion pattern echocardiographically in vitro after reimplantation and remodeling. MethodsBy using aortic roots of house pigs (aortoventricular diameter, 22 mm) a Yacoub procedure (22 -mm graft; group Y, n = 5) or a David I procedure (24 -mm graft; group D, n = 5) was performed. Roots after supracommissural replacement (22 -mm graft; group C, n = 5) served as control valves. In an electrohydraulic, computer-controlled pulse duplicator the valves were tested at flows of 2, 4, 7, and 9 L/min. Echocardiographically assessed parameters were rapid valve-opening velocity, slow valve-closing velocity, rapid valve-closing velocity, rapid valve-opening time, rapid valve-closing time, ejection time, maximum valve opening, slow valve-closing displacement, and maximum flow velocity. ResultsMean rapid valve-opening velocity and mean rapid valve-closing velocity at a cardiac output of 2 to 9 L/min were fastest in group D (rapid valve-opening velocity: 69 ± 10 cm/s [group D] vs 39 ± 4 cm/s [group Y] vs 42 ± 4 cm/s [group C], P =. 0041; rapid valve-closing velocity: 22 ± 2 cm/s [group D] vs 16 ± 2 cm/s [group Y] vs 17 ± 1 cm/s [group C], P =. 0272), and slow valve-closing velocity was slowest in group D (0. 2 ± 0. 1 cm/s [group D] vs 1. 0 ± 0. 3 cm/s [group Y] vs 0. 6 ± 0. 1 cm/s [group C], P =. 0063).

40|$|Application of {{solenoid valve}} {{actuators}} in internal combustion engines can facilitate operations such as {{variable valve timing}} for improved efficiency and emission. Unfortunately, <b>smooth</b> solenoid <b>valve</b> landing is hard to achieve due to limited control authority, limited bandwidth, and time varying disturbances. The resultant valve impact causes unacceptable noise and component wear on the engine. To solve this ``soft seating" problem, the controller is further divided into approach and landing sub-controllers. The landing controller causes the valve to follow a smooth trajectory for a low-impact landing in the last portion of the valve flight. Before armature landing starts, the approach controller complements the landing control by setting a consistent initial condition for the landing trajectory. This thesis focuses on developing a cycle-adaptive approach controller that utilizes information from the repetitive operations of the engine valve.

In this dissertation, a new evaporation speed controlling method is demonstrated using a thin liquid-film based microfluidic valve.

The thin liquid film with nonvolatility and immiscibility exhibited excellent microfluidic valve functionality without any stiction problem between valve components, and provided a very effective evaporation protection barrier for the microfluids in the device. Successful evaporation control by the liquid-film-embedded (LiFE) microfluidic valve has been demonstrated. In addition, guided actuation of the microfluidic valve along predefined paths was successfully achieved using newly developed oil-repellent surfaces, which were later used for developing ‘virtual walls’ for confining low surface tension liquids within predefined areas. Moreover, bioinspired slippery surfaces for aiding the microfluidic valve along the ejector surface have also been developed. These slippery surfaces were evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing microfluidic valve driving voltages.

As a part of the “Magdala project” and in the framework of the late Hellenistic-Roman (167 BC- 350 AD) sedimentary history reconstructed by Sarti et al. (in press) for Magdala harbour area (Kinneret Lake, north Israel), quantitative ostracod analyses were performed on 28 samples collected from two key stratigraphic sections excavated in front of the Roman harbour structures (docks and a flight of stairs). Along the sections, detailed described in terms of sedimentological features and anthropogenic artifacts (Lena, 2012; Sarti et al., in press), the abundant and well-preserved ostracod fauna show a very similar faunal composition and distribution. Despite the oligotypic character of the ostracod community, strongly dominated by the opportunistic, true euryhaline species Cyprideis torosa, two different associations were distinguished. Similarly to what observed within the present-day lake basin at ca. 5 m water depth (Mischke et al., 2010), comparable proportion of <b>smooth</b> and noded <b>valves</b> of C. torosa characterize the sandy interval barren in anthropogenic artifacts and interpreted as the natural lacustrine beach at the sections bottom (pre-harbour unit). At the passage to the overlying bay silty sands, containing several late Hellenistic archaeological artifacts, a sharp increase of noded C. torosa (up to 87 % of total fauna) is recorded along with the occurrence of other species preferring fine-grained substrates and high-organic stagnant waters, as Pseudocandona albicans. This diagnostic change in ostracod content is paralleled by a sharp increase in concentration (up to double concentration values) of trace metals Zn, Pb and Cu within the silty sands interval, suggesting the establishment of an anthropogenically forced semi-protected basin with high levels of heavy-metal pollution during the late Hellenistic period (sin-harbour unit). In order to increase the quality of our palaeoenvironmental reconstructions and provide insights into the harbour water chemistry derived by human activities, ostracod geochemistry analyses (ICP-MS, …) are in progress on C. torosa valves recovered from the pre-harbour and sin-harbour units. The integration of palaeontological and geochemical analyses will potentially differentiate unpolluted from polluted conditions, avoiding complications related to grain-size partitioning. This methodological approach may also improve our knowledge about the “factor X” (van Harten, 2000) that contributes to the development of phenotypic nodes on C. torosa within freshwater-oligohaline settings. Comparing element concentrations with the frequency of noded forms and plotting shell chemistry of <b>smooth</b> versus noded <b>valves</b> can provide new information about ostracods, including C. torosa ecophenotypical features, as bioindicators of high pollution levels within ancient lacustrine harbours...|$|R
40|$|The Upper Devonian (Tobigamori) {{and lowest}} Carboniferous (Karaumedate) {{formations}} are well exposed {{near the village}} of Minamiiwairi, especially along the Sarusawa river and on the slope of the southern hill of this river. The Devonian-Carboniferous boundary is observed at five places or more. One of them is shown in the Plate 1 and Fig. 3 of the Japanese text. In this outcrop the sandy rocks often intercalated volcanic materials, conglomerates and slates of the lowest Carboniferous is directly in contact with the black to gray slate of the Upper Devonian. In the crinoid sandstone at about 45 cm above this boundary, Rhipidomella mitchellini var. is contained, being not found in the Upper Devonian of this district. On the other hand, Cyrtospirifcr yabei and Bellerophon are found in the slate at about 10 cm below this boundary. As for as this outcrop is concerned, the relation between two systems is apparently appeared to be conformable. But these two are on the whole in unconformable relation in the Minamiiwairi district. The details of this study will be published in the next paper. In this paper, new genera of brachiopods contained in this boundary section are also described in Japanese, being summarized as follows. Globispirifer nagasakensis (TACHIBANA), n. gen. Globispirifer is abundantly found in the lowest Carboniferous of the Higashiyama district. Shell of small to large size; subcircular in outline; surface <b>smooth</b> in pedicle <b>valve,</b> but broadly plicated in brachial; obscure sulcus and low fold; delthyrium not covered by deltium; pedicle interior with developed dental lamellae; brachial with median ridge. Globispirifer is distinguished from other spiriferids in having the <b>smooth</b> pedicle <b>valve</b> with the obscure sulcus and the broadly plicated brachial valve. But in some specimens, somewhat indistinct median fold and weak lateral plicae near the anterior part are observed in the pedicle valve. Type species: Spirifer (Martiniopsis ?) nagasakensis TACHIBANA. (TACHIBANA, 1956, p. 13 - 14, Pl. 1, Fig. 15 - 20). Nodella pexa TACHIBANA, n. gen. et. sp. This genus is mainly found in the Upper Devonian Tobigamori, but rarely in the lowest Carboniferous Karaumaedate. Shell small to medium size; pedicle valve evenly to moderately convex; brachial valve nearly to gently concave; median sulcus and fold obscure; surface of both valves marked by numerous, often quincuncially arranged spine ridges which become finer on the adult stages; spines innumerable, delicate, long, hair-like; surface also marked by growth lines; interior of brachial valve with bilobed cardinal process divided by median sulcus; teeth, sockets, alveolus and interarea absent; lateral ridges parallel to hinge line; median septum very narrow; adductors obscure; brachial ridges not observed. Nodella resembles Sentosia in external form, but differs in the less prominent concentric markings and in having long hair-like spines. It is diiferent from Hamlingella belonging to Productellidae in its internal characters of the brachial valve and in having often quincuncially arranged short spine ridges. Nodella includes Productella nummularis WINCHELL from the English River Grits of the Mississippian and Waagenoconcha nummularis (WINCHELL) from the Upper Devonian Sulcifer beds of Kazakhstan. Type species: Krotovia nummularis (WINCHELL), (TACHIBANA, 1953, pl. 1, Figs. 1 - 10). Iwaispirifer striatolamellosus TACHIBANA, n. gen. et sp. (Fig. 4. a-c) This species is found in the Upper Devonian Tobigamori, being accompanied with Crytospirifer yabei and Leptophloeum australe. Shell small size; wider than long; cardinal extremities often mucronate; plicae simple; sulcus and fold non-plicated; often sulcus with a median plica; surface lamellose and marked by fine radial striae; dental lamellae short, frequently joined medially by secondary apical callosity; no median septum in pedicle interior; brachial interior with thin median septum. Iwaispinfer resembls Eleutherokomma, but differs from it in lacking the concentric micro-striae and micro-spines. It differs from Mucrospirifer in having radial striae {{on the surface of the}} valve. Type species: Iwaispirifer striatolamellosus TACHIBANA...|$|R
40|$|By use of {{the reverse}} {{transcription}} polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we determined the expression of adrenomedullin (AM) mRNA in the various tissues of the pig. To evaluate {{the significance of the}} expression of AM mRNA, we also determined the effects of AM on the cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and tension development of the porcine smooth muscle strips obtained from the coronary artery, pulmonary vein, trachea, ileum and urinary bladder. AM mRNA was widely expressed in the porcine tissues examined, which included myocardium (left and right ventricle and right atrium), kidney, lung, endothelial cells (aorta and aortic <b>valve),</b> <b>smooth</b> muscles (aorta, main pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, renal artery and vein, coronary artery, ileum, trachea and urinary bladder) and epithelial cells (trachea and urinary bladder). AM induced a decrease in [Ca 2 +]i and tension of the coronary artery, but not the pulmonary vein. AM had no effects on either the [Ca 2 +]i or tension of the trachea and urinary bladder strips or on the tension development of strips of ileum. These results indicated that AM has a role as an autocrine and/or paracrine regulator of the coronary arterial tone. AM probably does not have {{an important role in the}} regulation of the pulmonary venous, tracheal, ileac and urinary bladder smooth muscle tone, even though AM mRNA is expressed in these tissues; the functional significance of AM in these smooth muscles remains to be determined...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether tissue-engineered human allogeneic vein valves have a normal closure time (competency) and tolerate reflux pressure in vitro. MethodsFifteen human allogeneic femoral vein segments containing valves were harvested from cadavers. Valve closure time and resistance to reflux pressure (100  mm Hg) were assessed in an in vitro model to verify competency of the vein valves. The segments were tissue engineered using the technology of decellularization (DC) and recellularization (RC). The decellularized and recellularized vein segments were characterized biochemically, immunohistochemically, and biomechanically. ResultsFour of 15 veins with valves were found to be incompetent immediately after harvest. In total, 2 of 4 segments with incompetent valves and 10 of 11 segments with competent valves were further decellularized using detergents and DNAse. DC resulted in significant decrease in host DNA compared with controls. DC scaffolds, however, retained major extracellular matrix proteins and mechanical integrity. RC resulted in successful repopulation of the lumen and valves of the scaffold with endothelial and <b>smooth</b> muscle cells. <b>Valve</b> mechanical parameters were similar to the native tissue even after DC. Eight of 10 veins with competent valves remained competent even after DC and RC, whereas the two incompetent valves remained incompetent even after DC and RC. The valve closure time to reflux pressure of the tissue-engineered veins was < 0. 5  second. ConclusionsTissue-engineered veins with valves provide a valid template for future preclinical studies and eventual clinical applications. This technique may enable replacement of diseased incompetent or damaged deep veins to treat axial reflux and thus reduce ambulatory venous hypertension. Clinical RelevanceThe use of natural, human scaffolds to produce tissue-engineered venous segments containing functioning valves will revolutionize the surgical correction of deep venous reflux in patients with chronic venous insufficiency and leg ulcer. Reconstructive deep venous surgery in the form of valvuloplasty, transplantation, and neovalve construction has met limitations in the rare availability of valves to be repaired, lack of donor sites, and inadequate conditions to create new valves. This tissue-engineered procedure produces the functioning unit “valve-conduit,” and surgery will be used only to implant it...|$|R
