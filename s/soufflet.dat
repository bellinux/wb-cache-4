These vaults spring from thin continuous moldings before diverging into tiercerons, liernes, and transverse ribs. The north and south aisles feature quadripartite vaults with large pendant keystones. The nave arcade piers all differ from one another, though those on the south side feature tall (c. 5 feet) prismatic bases and continuous moldings.|$|R

6000|$|Sancho {{calls for}} benediction [...] "on {{the man who}} invented sleep." [...] It {{would have been more}} just to have asked this boon in behalf of him who invented eating and turtle-soup. The wearied fall into sleep, as it might be unwittingly; {{sometimes}} against their will, and often against their interests; while many a man is hungry without possessing the means of appeasing his appetite. Still more daily feel hunger without possessing turtle-soup. Certain persons impute this delicious compound to the genius of some London alderman, but we rather think unjustly. Aldermanic genius is easily excited and rendered active, no doubt, by strong appeals on such a theme, but our own experience inclines us to believe that the tropics usually send their inventions to the less fruitful regions of the earth along with their products. We have little doubt, could the fact be now ascertained, that it would be found turtle-soup was originally invented by just some such worthy as Jack Tier, who in filling his coppers to tickle the captain's appetite, had used all the condiments within his reach; ventured on a sort of Regent's punch; and, as the consequence, had brought forth the dish so often eulogized, and so well beloved. It is a little extraordinary that in Paris, the seat of gastronomy, one rarely, if ever, hears of or sees this dish; while in London it is to be met in almost as great abundance as in one of our larger commercial towns. But so it is, and we cannot say we much envy a cuisine its patés, and <b>soufflets,</b> and its à la this and à la thats, but which was never redolent with the odours of turtle-soup.|$|R
