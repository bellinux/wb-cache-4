5|$|In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had {{discovered}} a <b>simple</b> <b>method</b> to implement deduction on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 60s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems. A more fruitful approach to logic {{was developed in the}} 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.|$|E

5|$|In 1673, Jeremiah Horrocks {{published}} a reasonably accurate {{model of the}} Moon's motion in which the Moon was assumed to follow a precessing elliptical orbit. A sufficiently accurate and <b>simple</b> <b>method</b> for predicting the Moon's motion would have solved the navigational problem of determining a ship's longitude; in Newton's time, {{the goal was to}} predict the Moon's position to 2' (two arc-minutes), which would correspond to a 1° error in terrestrial longitude. Horrocks' model predicted the lunar position with errors no more than 10 arc-minutes; for comparison, the diameter of the Moon is roughly 30 arc-minutes.|$|E

5|$|Repeating nines also {{turn up in}} {{yet another}} of Georg Cantor's works. They {{must be taken into}} account to {{construct}} a valid proof, applying his 1891 diagonal argument to decimal expansions, of the uncountability of the unit interval. Such a proof needs to be able to declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal expansions, so one needs to avoid pairs like 0.2 and 0.1999... A <b>simple</b> <b>method</b> represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions; the opposite method rules out repeating nines. A variant that may be closer to Cantor's original argument actually uses base 2, and by turning base-3 expansions into base-2 expansions, one can prove the uncountability of the Cantor set as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolysis}} {{of water}} is a <b>simple</b> <b>method</b> of producing hydrogen. A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80–94%.|$|E

At the same time, he recognized the need for scientific data to back his promotion of the <b>simple</b> <b>methods,</b> and he set up extensive clinical trials, with his visiting nurses collecting data that measured {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>simple</b> <b>methods.</b> Again and again, it was shown that birth rates were reduced by as much as two-thirds or more using these <b>simple</b> <b>methods.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method for}} cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This <b>simple</b> <b>method</b> requires sound planning and servicing {{of the water}} damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters vermin. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>simple</b> <b>method,</b> tested {{during the}} MSRE program, is high {{temperature}} vacuum distillation. The lower boiling point fluorides like uranium tetrafluoride and the LiF and BeF carrier salt {{can be removed}} by distillation. Under vacuum the temperature can be lower than the ambient pressure boiling point. So a temperature of about 1000°C is sufficient to recover most of the FLiBe carrier salt. However, while possible in principle, separation of thorium fluoride from the even higher boiling point lanthanide fluorides would require very high temperatures and new materials.|$|E

25|$|Huma Shah {{points out}} that Turing himself was {{concerned}} with whether a machine could think and was providing a <b>simple</b> <b>method</b> to examine this: through human-machine question-answer sessions. Shah argues there is one imitation game which Turing described could be practicalised in two different ways: a) one-to-one interrogator-machine test, and b) simultaneous comparison of a machine with a human, both questioned in parallel by an interrogator. Since the Turing test is a test of indistinguishability in performance capacity, the verbal version generalises naturally to all of human performance capacity, verbal as well as nonverbal (robotic).|$|E
