5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and <b>skin</b> <b>grafting</b> in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as <b>skin</b> <b>grafting.</b> Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E

In his senior year, Banister suffered a knee injury playing American football, which nearly led to him being cut from the baseball team due to his decreased mobility.

25|$|Amputation of the {{affected}} limb(s) may be necessary. Repeat explorations usually {{need to be done}} to remove additional necrotic tissue. Typically, this leaves a large open wound, which often requires <b>skin</b> <b>grafting,</b> though necrosis of internal (thoracic and abdominal) viscera such as intestinal tissue is also possible. The associated systemic inflammatory response is usually profound, and most people will require monitoring in an intensive care unit. Because of the extreme nature of many of these wounds and the grafting and debridement that accompanies such a treatment, a burn center's wound clinic, which has staff trained in such wounds, may be utilized.|$|E
25|$|<b>Skin</b> <b>grafting</b> is {{patching}} of {{a defect}} with skin that {{is removed from}} another site in the body. The skin graft is sutured {{to the edges of}} the defect, and a bolster dressing is placed atop the graft for seven to ten days, to immobilize the graft as it heals in place. There are two forms of skin grafting: split thickness and full thickness. In a split thickness skin graft, a shaver is used to shave a layer of skin from the abdomen or thigh. The donor site regenerates skin and heals over a period of two weeks. In a full thickness skin graft, a segment of skin is totally removed and the donor site needs to be sutured closed.|$|E

40|$|With few exceptions, {{transplant}} patients {{must take}} immunosuppressants throughout their lives. In this study, we used anti-T-cell receptor (TCR/CD 3) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to induce immunological tolerance to alloantigens after withdrawal from tacrolimus in a fully allogeneic murine <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> model. <b>Skin</b> <b>grafts</b> from AKR donor mice were maintained in C 57 BL/ 6 recipients by administering tacrolimus for one month.

Seven days after mAb administration, the recipient mice were treated with various combinations of the following treatments: low-dose whole body irradiation, AKR bone marrow transfer (BMT), and anti-CD 3 mAb administration. The control recipient mice did not receive treatment with either mAb, nor any other treatment. All the control recipient mice showed rejection of AKR <b>skin</b> <b>grafts</b> 42 days after tacrolimus withdrawal (mean <b>skin</b> <b>graft</b> survival: 77 days).
