The depot was built as the Kingsbridge Car Barn, a {{streetcar}} barn owned by the Third Avenue Railway in the 1897. This barn, located {{on the west side of}} Ninth Avenue, was a one-story brick structure with a basement and steel frame. It was designed in Roman renaissance style with terracotta features. Among its designers included Isaac A. Hopper, who constructed Carnegie Hall. Across from the barn on the east side of Ninth Avenue was the Kingsbridge Power House, which was constructed around the same time and supplied electricity to the Third Avenue system. It was designed and built by Westinghouse Electric Corporation and by Hopper, with similar brick and terracotta features. The facility became the location of the company's central repair shop in 1947, when the 65th Street Shops closed. In 1948, Third Avenue's central repair shop was moved again to a facility in Yonkers, while the Kingsbridge Depot ceased <b>serving</b> <b>trolleys</b> and began <b>serving</b> buses in 1948.
