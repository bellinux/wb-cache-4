30|$|Our main {{conclusion}} {{is that in the}} reported test conditions, traffic with 50 % of cars having <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> results in adequate friction of icy road surfaces. With lower proportions of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres,</b> the friction is substantially lower. If authorities aim to discourage the use of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> by introducing a tax for their use, as in major cities in Norway [6] for example, the proportion of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> could be influenced {{by the size of the}} tax.|$|R
30|$|The main {{benefit of}} <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> over unstudded ones is their {{stronger}} ice grip at temperatures close to 0  °C [13], which helps drivers control their vehicles on slippery road surfaces. Most researchers appear {{to agree that}} <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> provide some safety benefit, although {{the size of this}} effect is frequently assessed as limited [4, 6 – 8, 10 – 12]. Recent studies have also examined whether increased use of electronic stability control can replace <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> [5, 12]. Elvik [5] concluded that when full penetration of electronic stability has been achieved in major cities in Norway, the number of accidents will not increase if the use of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> stays at around 15 %.|$|R

After 1000 runs per lane clear differences emerged, and after 1500 runs the friction {{in the lane}} involving 80 % of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> was 13 % lower compared to the lane with 100 % of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres.</b> The corresponding reduction for other lanes were as follows (proportions of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> in parentheses): 33 % (60 %), 41 % (40 %) and 43 % (20 %). In addition, {{it seems that the}} effects of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> were rather limited at low temperatures (− 5  °C or colder), whereas when the temperature was higher (from − 2  °C to − 3  °C) the grip was much better for the proportion of 80 – 100 % vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> compared to lower proportions. However, Tuononen and Sainio [14] argued that the main results of Vaa and Giaever are not plausible, as the results by ambient temperature were inconsistent.|$|R

50|$|The {{sport is}} divided into classes for full-rubber and studded tyres. The <b>studded</b> <b>tyre</b> {{category}} involves competitors riding on bikes with spikes up to 3 centimetres in length screwed into each treadless tyre, each bike has 90 spikes on the front tyre and 200-500 on the rear (regulations on length and types of permissible studs are controlled by the sanctioning body). The use of these spikes in this discipline necessitate the addition of special protective guards (similar to mudguards) over the wheels which extend almost to the ice surface. The spiked tyres produce {{a tremendous amount of}} traction and this means two-speed gearboxes are also required.|$|E
40|$|In {{the autumn}} of 2008, the Swedish Road Administration was {{commissioned}} by the Swedish Government to calculate the consequences of different reductions of <b>studded</b> <b>tyre</b> use.

Therefore, as {{there was no time}} for new studies. Existing models and data had to be used. Sales of European and Nordic stud-less winter tyres are distributed equally. Usage in traffic was therefore assumed to be equal as well. The estimated increase of accidents due to restrictions in the use of studded tyres is quite large, except in the event of studded tyres being banned in April. If everyone that does not use studded tyres selected the Nordic winter tyre available there would be a lower accident increase if the use of stud-less winter tyres is distributed equally.

40|$|VTI has {{during a}} {{considerable}} time of years monitored the wear from <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> through full-scale tests and control sections. During the winter 2006 - 2007, {{measurements of the}} wear were carried out at several control sections {{in the region of}} Stockholm. The aim of these measurements was to study: - the amount of wear caused by <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> on urban streets in Stockholm, - the amount of wear caused by <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> on express ways outside Stockholm, - the number of private cars using <b>studded</b> <b>tyres,</b> - the relevance of the wear prediction model when used for urban streets. The result of the study shows that the wear of the asphalt wearing courses on the express ways around Stockholm has increased during the last few years even after compensation with respect to the increased amount of traffic. This means that every vehicle equipped with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> wears away more material {{from the surface of the}} asphalt wearing course. One reason for this is that less wearing resistant aggregates have been used in the wearing courses on the express ways around Stockholm the last few years. Together with an increased amount of traffic it results in deeper wearing ruts compared with the winters in the beginning of this century. The rut depth caused by the traffic with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> was 2 - 3 mm in the winter 2006 / 2007...|$|R

40|$|Particles from {{road and}} tire wear have {{in recent years}} {{come to the fore}} as an {{important}} and relatively unexplored contribution to air particulate pollution. Mechanically generated wear particles are relatively coarse (> 0. 5 microns), but in controlled trials in VTI's road simulator it has been found that an ultra-fine fraction (< 100 nm) of particles is formed from tyre and pavement wear. This project was initiated to identify the source of these nanoparticles. The results show that the nanoparticles of the size 30 - 50 nm occur only from tests with studded tyres. One of the two tested Nordic unstudded winter tyres produced an even finer particle fraction (< 10 nm), while the other unstudded winter tyre type did not give rise to nanoparticles. Tests with summer tyres did not result in the formation of nanoparticles. It is clear that the fine particle fraction contains higher relative concentrations of sulphur, which is present at relatively high levels in both bitumen and tyres. It is unclear whether the ultrafine particles formed from <b>studded</b> <b>tyre</b> wear of road pavement in the road simulator also occur in real traffic. If so, this may affect the assessment of health effects from different traffic related particle sources...|$|E

30|$|In addition, two similar {{passenger}} cars (Volkswagen Golf) {{were used for}} friction measurements, one with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> and another with (Nordic) unstudded tyres. Two cars equipped with a different tyre type were selected instead of one for three reasons: (1) to ensure improved reliability of results, (2) the friction with unstudded tyres was of primary interest but the national requirements are based on measurements carried out with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres,</b> and (3) to get more balanced wear of the road surfaces by tyre type.|$|R
40|$|In {{regions where}} studded tyres and {{traction}} material are used during winter, e. g. the Nordic countries, {{northern part of}} USA, Canada, and Japan, mechanically generated particles from traffic are {{the main reason for}} high particle mass concentrations in busy street and road environments. In many Nordic municipalities the European environmental quality standard for inhalable particles (PM(10)) is exceeded due to these particles. In this study, particles from the wear of studded and studless friction tyres on two pavements and traction sanding were generated using a road simulator. The particles were characterized using particle sizers, Particle Induced X-Ray Emission Analysis and electron microscopy. Cell studies were conducted on particles sampled from the tests with studded tyres and compared with street environment, diesel exhaust and subway PM(10), respectively. The results show that in the road simulator, where resuspension is minimized, studded tyres produce tens of times more particles than friction tyres. Chemical analysis of the sampled particles shows that the generated wear particles consist almost entirely of minerals from the pavement stone material, but also that Sulfur is enriched for the submicron particles and that Zink is enriched for friction tyres for all particles sizes. The chemical data can be used for source identification and apportionment in urban aerosol studies. A mode of ultra-fine particles was also present and is hypothesised to originate in the tyres. Further, traction material properties affect PM(10) emission. The inflammatory potential of the particles from wear of pavements seems to depend on type of pavement and can be at least as potent as diesel exhaust particles. The results imply {{that there is a need}} and a good potential to reduce particle emission from pavement wear and winter time road and street operation by adjusting both <b>studded</b> <b>tyre</b> use as well as pavement and traction material properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{high costs}} of {{maintenance}} related to pavement wear have caused many countries to prohibit the use of studded tyres. In Japan and Norway, regulations have also been based upon the health aspects of the road dust. In Japan studded tyres are prohibited and in Norway, restrictions have {{been placed on the}} use of studded tyres in some larger cities. In Sweden, wear particles from pavements, tyres, brakes and winter sanding/salting, have received a lot of attention the last few years. The {{reason for this is that}} measurements have shown that these particles are the main reason that the upcoming environmental quality standard for inhalable particles (PM 10) will not be reached in many cities. The problem mainly occurs during dry episodes in winter and early spring and is mainly a result of <b>studded</b> <b>tyre</b> use and winter maintenance. A lot of new knowledge about wear particles is needed in order to develop cost-effective measures to deal with them. A great advantage is the possibility to study aerosols from each source both separately and in different combinations in a controlled environment. At VTI (Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute) a road simulator (PVM), previously used for pavement and tyre wear studies, is used as a wear particle generator. The PVM can be equipped with different pavements and tyres and even friction materials such as sand can be applied. The PVM can be used at speeds up to 70 km/h and the pavement can be dry or wet. Also the temperature in the hall can be regulated below zero degrees centigrade. In this paper some results from the WearTox project will be presented.

Allowed concentration of PM 10 is regulated by an EU directive which is implemented in an environmental quality standard in Sweden. One way of reducing pavement wear particles is {{to adjust the}} properties of the road pavement. In the present project the effect on particle emission from mixing milled tyre rubber into the pavement bitumen has been investigated. Tests were made by the VTI road simulator using two pavement constructions containing rubber (GAP 11 and GAÖ 11) and one reference pavement (ABS 11). GAP=GAR (Gap Graded Asphalt Rubber), ABS=SMA (Stone Mastic Asphalt) and GAÖ=OGAR (Open Graded Asphalt Rubber). The concentrations and size distributions of the emitted particles were measured. The results show that GAP 11 causes lower PM 10 concentrations (in this laboratory environment 20 – 25 %) than the reference pavement ABS 11, while the GAÖ 11 does not differ from the reference. Size distributions show that PM 10 has a bi-modal distribution with two mass maxima at 4 – 5 and 7 – 8 μm. GAP 11 decreases the mass size distribution mainly in the finer mode, while GAÖ 11 seems to affect mainly the coarser mode. Ultrafine particles are emitted during all tests and have number distribution maxima at around 20 – 30 nm. These particles are formed in the interaction between tyre studs and pavement and/or tyre rubber. Higher speed generates higher concentrations of ultrafine particles. All in all, the results indicate a lowering effect on PM 10 emissions caused by GAP 11, while the GAÖ 11 does not seem to lower the emissions as compared to the reference pavement ABS 11.

After every 10 runs the proportional use of lanes was as designed. For example, after 10 runs the vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> had used the test lanes 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0 times and the vehicles with unstudded tyres had used the respective lanes 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 times.

Based on their results, Tuononen and Sainio suggest that the proportion of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> can be as low as 25 – 50 % with no risk of substantial polishing of the icy road surface. The study has several points to its credit, but it could be asked whether the lanes were used sufficiently compared to the traffic flows on many urban streets or rural roads. Also, the results show that on the acceleration section the friction dropped dramatically if the proportion of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> was 0 – 80 %. Tuononen and Sainio argued that acceleration areas are not as critical for safety as braking sections. However, no particular road section can be assessed as unimportant in terms of road safety, because by contrast with a test track, drivers in real traffic may need to apply emergency braking on any section of road.|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this project}} have been to {{describe}} PM 10 from <b>studded</b> <b>tyre</b> wear and to study their inflammatory effects in human airway cells. The VTI circular road simulator {{has been used to}} generate "clean" wear particles from two different pavements; asphalt concrete (ABT) and stone mastic asphalt (ABS), with granite respectively quartzite as the main stone materials. The advantage of using the road simulator is that the contribution from other sources can be minimised. During the project time, the project was expanded also to study particle generation by non-studded winter tyres (friction tyres) and two kinds of winter sanding agents, namely washed crushed stone and unwashed natural sand in combination with both studded and friction tyres. Most of these parts of the project are presented in VTI report 520. The results show that pavement wear by studded tyres generates about 40 - 50 times as much PM 10 as that by friction tyres, but also that the ABT pavement generates several times more PM 10 than the ABS pavement. The size distribution within PM 10 has a maximum around 3 - 4 ?m and more than 95 % of the mass is larger than 1 ?m. PM 10 is totally dominated by fresh stone material. A fraction of very small particles, with a number concentration peak at around 30 - 40 nm, was also discovered. Their origin is unknown, but since the number distribution shifted depending on which tyre type was used, a possible origin is the tyres. In the cell studies the inflammation potential of the wear particles was compared with PM 10 from Hornsgatan in Stockholm and PM 10 from a Stockholm subway station. Later on in the project, diesel particles were made available for comparison. The cell study results show that PM 10 from the ABT pavement is at least as inflammatory as diesel particles and more inflammatory than PM 10 from the subway. The PM 10 from Hornsgatan generally had the highest potential, but PM 10 from the ABT pavement was often in parity. This {{despite the fact that the}} Hornsgatan PM 10 were the only particle sample where endotoxin could be detected. Endotoxin causes an additive effect in studies of inflammation potential. PM 10 from the ABS pavement generally had a lower potential than PM 10 from the ABT pavement...|$|E
40|$|Resuspended road dust has, {{during the}} last years, {{proved to be a}} contributive cause to high {{concentrations}} of inhalable particles (PM 10) in ambient air. The connection of PM 10 to negative health effects has lead to an environmental quality standard which will be in force from 1 st of January 2005. This calls for local and road authorities to investigate if the standard is reached and if so, what measures have to be taken to reduce concentrations. This study aims at investigating what methods and strategies are in use in Swedish municipalities, their awareness concerning the dust mitigating effectivity of measures taken and to investigate the knowledge on road dust and sweeping in our neighbouring countries. The method was a questionnaire to 103 municipalities and 7 regional road authorities as well as literature and contacts with various road authorities in Norway, Denmark, Finland and California. The results show that dusting from road are considered a large problem among road authorities and that the problems are worst during spring. The main cause to sweeping is comfort and sanitary concerns followed by safety and health concerns. Wet sweeping is the most common method and today no methods are in use especially intended for reducing PM 10 concentrations. Only 10 % of the respondents plan to improve methods or strategies. In Helsinki the road dust problem is mainly blamed on winter sanding and has been addressed since the late 80 s. An ambitious sweeping method consisting of four co-operating units is used. In Oslo, road dust is blamed on studded tyres and the efforts have been focused on reducing <b>studded</b> <b>tyre</b> frequency. Sweeping methods has been evaluated and the results have been implemented in road and street sweeping. Neither in Helsinki nor in Oslo have the sweeping methods and strategies yet proved to reduce PM 10 concentrations. In California the "Rule 1186 ", demanding sweepers to be PM 10 efficient, has resulted in some development, e. g. regenerative air sweepers and vacuum assisted dry sweepers. All in all this report shows that the knowledge about the contribution of road dust to PM,o and assumed possibilities for more efficient sweeping to reach the environmental standard is low among local and road authorities. In combination with the lack of PM 10 data for Swedish municipalities and the near compliance with the environmental quality standard, this is a potentially large problem...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the evaluation and development of models related to the emissions and dispersion of traffic induced road dust. Road traffic is a highly important source of a range of pollutants having adverse health and environmental effects. Development of models describing traffic related emissions and dispersion of pollutants will in the end lead to robust models that well reproduce available air quality measurements. Furthermore, such models will aid the analysis of existing mitigation measures, as well as developing new ones, to reduce the emissions of traffic related pollutants. The first study deals with the modelling of the dispersion and resulting concentration levels of NOx at distances up to 100 m from major roads in rural areas, using four Gaussian open road line source models developed in Norway, Denmark and Finland. These models were applied to datasets from measurement campaigns conducted in rural areas near major roads in the mentioned countries. NOx was considered since it was measured at all sites, its emissions are well known and since it can be treated as a tracer for the short time scales involved. When comparing the models with the measurements we found that the results are sensitive to the parameterisation of traffic produced turbulence (TPT), especially at distances close to the road in combination with low wind speeds. The Danish model OML-Highway performed best at all sites due to its parameterisation of TPT based on turbulent kinetic energy. The second study {{is concerned with}} the development of a more generalised model framework to describe road dust emissions, i. e. emissions of particulate matter (PM) from the road surface due to road surface wear as well as resuspension of deposited material on the road surface and road shoulders. There is a need for a more generalised road dust emission model since the majority of already developed road dust emission models contain empirical constants or functions related to local air quality measurements. As such, the applicability of these models on other road environments is limited and they cannot be used for analysis of mitigation measures related to road dust emissions. The model concept described in this study accounts for the main processes controlling road dust emissions and does not depend on local measurements; it is based on measurements of road, tyre and brake wear to obtain the relevant emission factors. A mass balance concept is used for describing the variation in dust load on the road surface and shoulders. Furthermore, the model separates the direct emissions and resuspension and treats the road surface and shoulder as two individual sources. When applying the model onto two datasets from measurement campaigns conducted at major roads in and outside Oslo, Norway, during the <b>studded</b> <b>tyre</b> season, it performed well during warm periods and less well for temperatures close to or below 0 ºC in combination with precipitation. As such, refinements of the parameterisations of road surface conditions are needed and measurement campaigns with the aim of understanding the effect of road surface conditions on road dust emissions should be conducted. In spite of the current limitations, the model provides a well described conceptual framework and describes processes that no model has ever done before. The model will in the future provide the potential for good air quality planning...|$|E
30|$|Aside {{from the}} overall safety {{effects of these}} tyre types, a more {{specific}} and long discussed issue has been whether <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> prevent wintry roads from becoming over-polished, and whether a certain proportion {{of them would be}} needed for the sake of safety. This cannot of course be answered with a single figure, since the degree of slipperiness varies with the weather conditions and is mitigated by several approaches with concurrent effects, such as winter maintenance and tyre properties. Nevertheless, the question is currently relevant, as the use of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> is discouraged by many cities in the Nordic countries due to their adverse health effects [9].|$|R
30|$|However, {{any single}} study is {{unlikely}} to provide a full picture of the needed proportion of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> for sufficient friction, given that road conditions keep changing {{and there are other}} factors affecting friction as well. For example, winter maintenance aims to keep friction at an acceptable level and there are heavy vehicles in real traffic that may wear snow or ice more quickly than cars but may also polish icy road surfaces. Consequently, the main contribution of these results is to provide one piece of evidence for decision making, if the societal goal is to reduce the adverse effects of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> without hampering road safety.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the grip of winter tyres on ice and snow deteriorates with age {{to such an extent that}} winter tyres above a certain age e. g. 10 years should be {{forbidden}} to use. Little research data do however exist. This investigation has been carried out by VTI in order to get a better background for legal decisions. The results would also be of use for ordinary consumers as a guidance. This investigation that was carried out on wet smooth ice is the third of three part studies. The first was on smooth ice at - 3 °C and the second on rough ice at - 3 °C. They have been reported in VTI meddelande 923 and VTI notat 34 - 2003. The aim of the investigation is to investigate the correlation between ice grip of winter tyres and their age, tread depth and tread rubber hardness and for <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> also <b>stud</b> protrusion and stud force. The investigation comprises 23 studded and 42 non <b>studded</b> winter <b>tyres</b> and four summer tyres mainly of the in Sweden popular brands Gislaved, Michelin and Good Year, primarily of size 195 / 65 R 15. Most of the tyres had been driven in ordinary traffic and were manufactured from 1981 to 2003. A small number of new winter tyres were also tested. As reference some new summer tyres were tested as well. The steering and braking performance of the tyres has been measured in a special climate controlled indoor high speed flat bed test facility developed by the VTI. Very good correlation has earlier been found between results from the facility and lap time results from ice track circuit tests with cars as well as pure braking and cornering tests with cars on ice tracks. No age related deterioration of the ice grip was found for the fully <b>studded</b> winter <b>tyres</b> with <b>stud</b> protrusion 1 mm and higher. The ice grip deteriorated with increasing age for non <b>studded</b> winter <b>tyres</b> and <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> with <b>stud</b> protrusion less than 0, 9 mm. The results also show that on wet smooth ice <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> with <b>stud</b> protrusion 1 mm and higher are much superior to non <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> including the specialised studless winter tyres often called "friction tyres".

40|$|In many countries, where <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> are prohibited, {{the traffic}} {{polishing}} of the coarse aggregate in the wearing courses {{is a problem}} to a rather great extent.

Therefore, there have been few problems with low wet friction levels in Sweden. However, the increased use of wear resistant aggregates and stone mastic asphalt together with lightweight studs has led to a reduced amount of wear.

Hence, the traffic safety of buses during the wintertime has been studied in more detail. The study comprised the following parts: - Gripping power studies on ice in VTI's tyre test facility. - Accident study and a survey of the use of tyre. - Focus group to gain knowledge about dangerous situations. - Driving simulator study to test the importance of the tyres during problematic situations. Tests in VTI's tyre test facility on smooth ice did not show any significant difference between summer tyres and non-studded winter <b>tyres,</b> while <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> exhibit a better ice grip than non-studded tyres. Nor did driving simulator tests when driving on ice covered road under the influence of heavy wind from the side show a difference between summer tyres and non-studded winter tyres. Also in these tests the <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> were superior to the non-studded. If <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> are used only on one axle, the driving simulator study showed that during side wind the ability to steer is important. The accident study showed that the buses that have summer tyres on the steering axle and winter tyres on the drivé axle has the lowest estimated accident risk, although it is not statistically significant. The buses equipped with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> on both axles could not be statistically analysed since only 2 accidents occurred on bare roadways, and none on icy/snowy roadways, {{while at the same time}} the buses in this category drive a lot on icy/snowy roadways. This probably makes these buses the safest on winter roadways. From the focus groups it was clear that the time table has a great influence on the creating of stress and the demands on the drivers to keep the speed even during slippery roadways. Many bus drivers experience large problems with bad snow clearance, or other winter maintenance. At the same time there is a large consciousness among the drivers that it is always their own way of handling the vehicle that is the determining factor for traffic safety. The drivers were expressing a lack of further education and practical exercises with buses on slippery roads...|$|R
30|$|The {{effects of}} tyre type on rut depth {{show that the}} depth {{increased}} much faster on compact snow than on ice during the test. In fact, the snowy surface wore so quickly and inconsistently that {{we were unable to}} accurately measure the increase in ruts. However, on icy surfaces, the more vehicles there were with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres,</b> the deeper the mean depth of ruts {{was at the end of}} the test.|$|R
