5|$|A beefsteak {{is a type}} of banquet {{in which}} sliced beef {{tenderloin}} is served to diners as all-you-can-eat finger food. The dining <b>style</b> originated in 19th-century New York City as a type of working-class celebration but went into a decline in the mid-20th century. Resurrected by caterers in New Jersey, the beefsteak banquet <b>style</b> is now popular in that state's Bergen and Passaic counties, and is enjoying a revival in New York City, where the <b>style</b> originated, due to the reemergence of a biannual beefsteak in Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} rare feature {{found on}} Motul de San José ceramics {{is the so-called}} X-ray <b>style,</b> showing a figure wearing a mask but also portraying his face underneath it. All the other representations using this rare <b>style</b> are depicted on Late Classic sculptures at sites with which {{it is known that}} Motul de San José had contact at this time, including Dos Pilas, Machaquila, Tikal and Yaxchilan. This X-ray <b>style</b> has been found on at least nine painted vessels from Motul de San José and is also used {{on the west side of}} Stela 2.|$|E
5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, the Oriental art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet {{was even more}} important to his <b>style.</b> Chinese and Japanese art became the base for the decorative, slightly naïve <b>style</b> in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s. Jolin's <b>style</b> deviates {{from that of the}} traditional Expressionists, in that he simplifies his motifs in an almost primitive way, painting an imagined reality rather than raw emotions.|$|E
50|$|Drawing <b>styles</b> {{provide the}} option to {{automatically}} create drawings and to modify the layout exactly to user requirements. Drawing <b>styles</b> are used {{in a similar way}} to AutoCAD dimension <b>styles,</b> line <b>styles,</b> etc. The predefined drawing <b>styles</b> are different for each installation and country. Custom drawing <b>styles</b> can also be defined.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} match, AJ <b>Styles</b> faced Shane McMahon. During the match, <b>Styles</b> {{attempted}} a springboard 450° splash on Shane, who countered into a triangle choke on <b>Styles,</b> who then countered into a one-armed <b>Styles</b> Clash on Shane for a near-fall. After the referee was knocked down, <b>Styles</b> attempted a Coast-to-Coast on Shane, who countered by attacking <b>Styles</b> with {{a trash can}}. Shane then performed a Coast-to-Coast into a trash can on <b>Styles</b> for a near-fall. Shane attempted a Leap of Faith through an announce table on <b>Styles,</b> only for <b>Styles</b> {{to move out of}} the way and Shane fell through the announce table. As <b>Styles</b> attempted a Phenomenal Forearm on Shane, Shane countered into a float-over DDT on <b>Styles.</b> Shane attempted a shooting star press on <b>Styles,</b> who avoided the move and performed a Phenomenal Forearm on Shane to win the match.|$|R
50|$|In {{the main}} event, Dean Ambrose defended the WWE World Championship against AJ <b>Styles.</b> During the match, <b>Styles</b> applied the Calf Crusher on Ambrose but Ambrose touched the ropes, forcing <b>Styles</b> {{to break the}} hold. <b>Styles</b> re-applied the Calf Crusher later on, but Ambrose escaped. <b>Styles</b> {{executed}} a Springboard 450 Splash on Ambrose for a near-fall. Ambrose threw <b>Styles</b> over the barricade and leapt onto him off a broadcast table. In the end, <b>Styles</b> countered Dirty Deeds by pushing Ambrose into the referee. Seizing the opportunity, <b>Styles</b> attacked Ambrose with a low blow, followed by a <b>Styles</b> Clash, to win the title.|$|R
5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline <b>style</b> of certain bivalves and gastropods. The <b>style</b> consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the <b>style</b> in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the <b>style</b> is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E
5|$|Another case of synesthesia is {{swimming}}-style synesthesia {{in which}} each swimming <b>style</b> {{is associated with a}} vivid experience of a color. These synesthetes do not need to perform the actual movements of a corresponding swimming <b>style.</b> To activate the concurrent experiences, it is sufficient to activate the concept of a swimming <b>style</b> (e.g., by presenting a photograph of a swimmer or simply talking about swimming).|$|E
5|$|Another <b>style</b> {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. This <b>style</b> was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz dance. R singer Beyoncé uses this <b>style.</b> Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this <b>style.</b> They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a <b>style</b> of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on the balls of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E
50|$|In {{the fifth}} match, AJ <b>Styles</b> faced Chris Jericho. During the match, Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho on <b>Styles</b> but <b>Styles</b> reached the ropes, forcing Jericho {{to break the}} hold. Jericho {{executed}} a Codebreaker on <b>Styles</b> but Styles's arm being under the bottom rope voided the pinfall. <b>Styles</b> executed a <b>Styles</b> Clash on Jericho for a near-fall. <b>Styles</b> forced Jericho {{to submit to the}} Calf Crusher to win the match.|$|R
5|$|The eighth {{match was}} between A.J. <b>Styles</b> and Tetsuya Naito. Although <b>Styles</b> twice {{attempted}} his signature <b>Styles</b> Clash, Naito countered and <b>Styles</b> then focused on attacking Naito's left leg. <b>Styles</b> later applied the Calf Killer, forcing Naito {{to grab the}} rope to break the hold. After another <b>Styles</b> Clash attempt, Naito countered by throwing <b>Styles</b> over the top rope to the floor. When <b>Styles</b> returned to the ring after a 19 count (NJPW employs a 20 count in their matches), Naito attempted a top-rope huracanrana. <b>Styles</b> blocked it, converting it to a <b>Styles</b> Clash from the second rope before pinning Naito for another Bullet Club victory at 14 minutes and 25 seconds.|$|R
50|$|<b>Styling.</b> Elm {{needs to}} know {{precisely}} the width and height of elements, so <b>styling</b> is done through Elm <b>styling</b> functions instead of leaving it to external CSS. It lacks margins and paddings for now.

5|$|Architecture in the <b>style</b> of a tongkonan {{is still}} very common. Various {{administration}} buildings were built in this <b>style</b> in recent years, e.g. the Kecamatan building in Rantepao.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schubert's last sonatas {{have long}} been historically neglected, dismissed as inferior in <b>style</b> to Beethoven's piano sonatas. However, the negative view has changed during the late twentieth century, and today these works are usually praised for their conveying of an idiosyncratic, personal Schubertian <b>style,</b> indeed quite different from Beethoven's, but holding its own virtues. In this mature <b>style,</b> the Classical perception of harmony and tonality, and the treatment of musical structure, are radically altered, generating a new, distinct type of sonata form.|$|E
5|$|Augie March's {{distinctive}} musical <b>style</b> {{is directed}} by songwriter and vocalist Richards. His lyrics often draw critical acclaim for their poetic <b>style.</b> The band's music is generally described as intricate, lush, and dense, acting as a backdrop for Richards' complex and poetic vocals.|$|E

5|$|From around 1840, architects {{started to}} design wooden {{buildings}} {{in a new}} <b>style,</b> the so-called Swiss chalet <b>style.</b> The <b>style</b> and its name originated in Germany, where Swiss popular culture was much admired by the romanticists. Elements such as projecting roofs, verandas and emphasis on gables were inspired from Alpine vernacular buildings. But the <b>style</b> may more correctly be termed historicism in wood, a term introduced by Jens Christian Eldal. A number of residential, institutional, and commercial buildings were built in this <b>style,</b> characterized by ornate, projecting details. Railway stations and churches, designed by trained architects, were distributed all in rural districts and helped to make this <b>style</b> popular and to keep it alive in the vernacular tradition long after it went out of fashion among architects.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} learning <b>styles</b> in language classrooms. The study examined lays out the learning <b>styles</b> of the students. Groups formed by the researchers considering the learning <b>styles</b> of the students show how learning <b>styles</b> affect the performance on group work activities in language learning. By finding out the learning <b>styles</b> {{of the students and}} giving activities according to them, the teacher might improve the efficiency {{of his or her own}} teaching and increase the success rate. By targeting all learning <b>styles</b> and forming groups with students who have different learning <b>styles,</b> the teacher is also able to help the students develop their less dominant <b>styles...</b>|$|R
