The present work {{deals with the}} computational analysis of flow (CFD analysis) and heat transfer with pin fin. In the present work a diamond <b>shaped</b> <b>pin</b> fin are used and is investigated under constant heat flux condition at the place of plane fin or elliptical pin fin. Here compare the results of different parameters i. e. major diagonal and minor diagonal. The diamond <b>shaped</b> <b>pin</b> fin heat sink with three different length and three different widths are accomplished {{to examine the effects}} of the pin fin shape of the heat sink on the thermal performance. Effects of different geometrical configurations parameters of the diamond <b>shaped</b> <b>pin</b> fin heat sink and heat flux on the heat transfer characteristics and pressure drop are considered. This study gives good co relation with width and length of the Diamond <b>shaped</b> <b>pin</b> fin and also with width the thermal performance varies. The investigation is to reduce the thermal resistance also with considerable pressure drop for different profiles.

This research {{presents the results}} of a combined numerical and experimental study of heat transfer and pressure drop behavior in a compact heat exchanger (CHE) designed with drop-shaped pin fins. A numerical study using ANSYS was first conducted to select the optimum pin shape and configuration for the CHE. This was followed by an experimental study to validate the numerical model. The results indicate that the drop <b>shaped</b> <b>pin</b> fins yield a considerable improvement in heat transfer compared to circular pin fins for the same pressure drop characteristics. This improvement is mainly due to the increased wetted surface area of the drop pins, and the delay in the flow separation as it passes the more streamlined drop <b>shaped</b> <b>pin</b> fins. The data and conclusions of this study can be used in heat exchanger design for large heat flux cooling applications as in gas turbine blades, and high-power electronics.

The case of bifurcated type <b>shape</b> memory alloy <b>pins</b> inserted inside the composite strip around the hole to reinforce the laminate, which was subjected to the axial stress was simulated. The models for stress analysis were established by using ANSYS finite element programme. Two types of <b>shape</b> memory alloy <b>pins</b> were proposed to insert along the through thickness direction of the carbon fibre woven fabric composite strip to induce the clamping force. The pre-tensioned load {{was applied to the}} <b>shape</b> memory alloy <b>pins</b> in order to reduce occurrence of delamination in the laminate. Three-dimensional elements and contact elements were used to simulate the contact between the composite laminate and <b>shape</b> memory alloy <b>pin</b> to investigate the stress distribution around the hole in the composite strip. The effect of pre-strain of shape memory alloy on the stresses inside composite was studied. The results show that the stress characteristics of the button-shaped and bifurcated <b>shape</b> memory alloy <b>pin</b> models are similar; however, the stresses for the button-shaped pin model are lower. The tensile and compressive stresses, both in button-shaped and bifurcated pin models, are strongly dependent on the percentage of pre-strain of the shape memory alloy. It is therefore concluded that the <b>shape</b> memory alloy <b>pin</b> method was significantly reduced the stress concentration of the composite strip laminate.

The Reynolds number based on the obstructed section hydraulic diameter (defined as {{the ratio of the}} total wetted surface area to the open duct volume available for flow) was varied from 4800 to 8200. The more streamlined drop-shaped pin fins were better at delaying or suppressing separation of the flow passing through them, which decreased the aerodynamic penalty compared to circular pin fins. The heat transfer enhancement of the drop-shaped pin fins was less than that of the circular pin fins.

Welding was carried out at different plunge depths of 0. 0, 0. 2, 0. 3 and 0. 4 mm together with rotation and transverse speeds of 500 rpm and 40 mm/min, respectively. Material flow, tensile strength and hardness of the weldment were evaluated. The results indicated that joint properties were significantly affected by tool design. It was found that material flow was higher for diamond pin tool compared to that of square pin resulting in considerable increased in tensile strength of the joint. In addition, the highest tensile strength was obtained on the samples welded with square shape pin at 0. 4 mm plunge depth whilst the lowest was by diamond shape at the plunge depth of 0. 0 mm.

40|$|Layer-based rapid {{fabrication}} {{technologies have}} two distinct advantages: (1) build parts without geometry restriction; (2) build sub-systems (static or mobile) {{without the need}} for assembly. Many previous papers have reported various applications that could benefit from the first advantage. Yet, very limited researches have investigated the applications that can benefit from the second advantage. One of the major reasons is the limited accuracy of current layer-based fabrication technologies that can only make mechanism joint with large clearance. This limitation has prohibited the fabrication of sensible joints in mobile sub-systems such as mechanisms, because large clearance at joints is the major source for excessive impact force, resulting in wear and tear of the joints, and consequently the malfunction/degradation of a mechanism's performance. Thus, how to reduce the joint clearance is a major research issue for layer-based rapid fabrication of non-assembly mechanisms. In this paper, different pin joint designs are analysed. It was found that drum <b>shaped</b> <b>pin</b> joint design gives the minimum joint clearance in layer-based fabrication, and at the same time, without weakening the joint strength compared to the traditional cylindrical pin joint design. A number of sample joints and mechanisms have been made by a layer-based fabrication machine Objet Eden 350 V to test the effectiveness of the proposed drum shaped joint design. © 2011 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Significant {{efforts have}} been made in the last decades to {{decrease}} the world’s dependency to fossil fuels. One of the fronts which has shown major improvement is gas turbine efficiency. To this end, components such as recuperators have been developed to recover heat that is usually trapped and wasted in the exhaust gases of combustion processes. Brayton Energy Canada has recently developed a promising compact heat exchanger that could be used as a recuperator in gas turbines. Nevertheless, this novel type of wire mesh heat exchanger still has room for improvement, especially regarding the way that its fin arrays are manufactured due to the fact that the technique presently used is time consuming and consequently costly. The present research aims to manufacture near-net <b>shaped</b> <b>pin</b> fin arrays using cold gas dynamic spray as an additive manufacturing technique by selectively covering the substrate by the means of a mask. Moreover, this research work studies the feasibility of using CGDS as an additive manufacturing technique to produce pin fin arrays, the thermal and hydrodynamic performances of this new type of pin fin created, the effect of geometric parameters such as fin density and height on the performances, the viability of the sprayed pin fins in a real environment by means of finding mechanical properties such as adhesion strength, the possibility of producing a streamwise material anisotropic fin arrays, and finally the different adhesion mechanisms by means of numerical modeling of the relevant impact physics...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{has become}} a growing concern in a world driven by a fossil fuel economy. Recuperated micro-gas-turbine systems offer the possibility of high efficiency power generation for low output power systems. To this end, increasing the performance while decreasing the cost, the weight and the volume of heat exchangers such as recuperators {{has become a}} critical research focus. Recent work done by Brayton Energy Canada (BEC) has renewed interest in Wire Mesh Heat Exchangers (WMHE) by introducing a new production method that uses cells of stacked wire mesh sheets that have a thick external shell deposited by cold spray. Fins are then machined in this external shell, creating a heat exchanger. Net <b>shaped</b> <b>pin</b> fins were successfully deposited using Cold Gas Dynamic Spraying (CGDS or simply cold spray) as an additive manufacturing technique to replace the plate fin arrays currently used. This new development is envisioned to save costs while providing higher heat transfer efficiency than traditional fin arrays. Increasing the performance of such fin arrays would yield higher heat exchanger efficiencies and increase the total efficiency of the gas turbine system. The present thesis provides {{a description of the}} research performed, as well as the results thereof, with regards to the performance of pin fin arrays produced using cold spray. A review of the relevant literature is performed to establish the motivation of this study and to describe the relevant work that has been performed by other authors in this respect.

Furthermore, the proposed approach and the experimental equipment that will be used are described in this work.

40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is an {{emerging}} solid state welding process. It {{has been a}} proven method for welding high strength aluminium alloys which were previously not recommended for conventional fusion welding. Since {{the invention of the}} process by The Welding Institute, United Kingdom, in 1991, {{a number of studies have}} been conducted on the material flow, microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of friction stir welds. However, there is not enough conceptual background available on FSW process for physical understanding of the mechanism of weld formation. In addition to that, FSW welds of high strength precipitation hardenable aluminium alloys suffer from reduced joint efficiency due to overaging in the heat affected zone. In the present investigation, experimental analysis has been carried out to understand the mechanism of weld formation and parameter optimization for aluminium alloys 7020 -T 6 and 6061 -T 6. For this purpose the investigations have been made on both the process aspects and the material aspects. The process aspects are analyzed with the objective of learning the mechanism to produce defect free welds. For this purpose experiments have been carried out to analyze the effect of FSW parameters, material flow and the frictional characteristics between the tool and base metal. Preliminary experiments are conducted on aluminium alloy 7020 -T 6 with different tool geometries to analyze the interaction of the tool with the base metal using a knee-type vertical milling machine. Then, the tool geometry which produced defect-free weld is used for further experimentation. The role of tool pin, shoulder and axial load on the formation of defect free weld is analyzed in an innovative experiment, where the tool and base metal interaction is continuously increased by continuously increasing the interference between the tool and base metal. In another experiment the initial abutting interface position with respect to the tool is continuously varied to study the interaction of the tool with the initial interface and to find the positional information where the initial interface is completely eliminated. Further, the tool metal interface condition is studied using a specially designed tribological experiment which simulates the FSW condition. From the base metal point of view, due to the strain, strain rate and temperature imposed on the base metal during the process, the microstructure is altered. In precipitation hardenable aluminium alloys the strengthening precipitates are dissolved or overaged in the weld region depending on the peak temperature in the region, which reduces the joint efficiency. However, the dissolution and overaging are kinetic process. In order to analyze this time dependant softening behavior of the base metal 7020 -T 6 and 6061 -T 6, isothermal annealing and differential scanning calorimetric studies are performed. In order to obtain FSW welds with maximum joint efficiency, the welding temperature should not exceed the “softening temperature” of the base metal. But, to produce defect free welds favorable material flow in the weld nugget is necessary. The material flow and consolidation depend on the process temperature. Hence, for a given tool to produce defect free weld there is a need for minimum temperature. If the weld formation temperature is less than the base metal softening temperature, the weld can be made with 100 % joint efficiency. In order to optimize the FSW parameter which gives defect free weld with lowest possible temperature, an instrumented programmable FSW machine is designed and developed. The machine is designed in such a way that welding parameters – rotation speed, traverse speed and plunging depth – can be continuously varied from the start to end of the weld between given two values. This reduces the number of experimental trials, material and time. Based on the experimental results the following conclusions are derived. 1. The minimum diameter of the pin required for FSW depends on the base metal and tool material property for a given set of parameters. If the pin diameter is insufficient for a given set of welding parameters, it fails during plunging operation itself. 2. There is a minimum diameter of the shoulder for a given diameter of the pin which produces defect free weld. The ratio of pin to shoulder to produce a defect free weld is not a constant value. It changes with tool geometry and process parameters. 3. Increasing the area of contact between the tool and shoulder for a given set of parameters increases the heat input and results in increased weld nugget grain size. 4. Initial abutting interface of the base metal is eliminated at the leading edge of the tool. However, new surfaces are generated due to interaction with the tool and the newer surfaces are consolidated at the trailing edge of the tool. Importantly, the weld strength is controlled by the defects generated due the improper elimination of newly generated surfaces. 5. Optimal axial load is required to generate the required pressure to consolidate the transferred material at the trailing edge of the tool and should be equal to the flow stress of the material at the processing temperature. The optimal axial load is 8. 1 kN for a tool having 20 mm diameter shoulder with 6 mm diameter frustum <b>shaped</b> <b>pin.</b> 6. Only the material that approaches the tool at the leading edge on the advancing side is stirred and the remaining material is simply extruded around the tool. Further, the initial abutting interface is completely removed only when it is located in the stirring zone, otherwise the initial abutting interface is not eliminated. In the present study the interface is completely stirred when it is located on the advancing side of the tool between 0. 5 mm away from the centerline and edge of the tool. 7. The temperature and pressure at the tool–base metal interface is above the temperature and pressure required for seizure to occur for given tool material (H 13) and base metal (7020 -T 6). Hence, it is clear that during FSW the base metal transfers on to the tool and interaction occurs between transferred layer on tool and base metal. The coefficient of friction between the given tool material and base metal in FSW condition is in the range of 1. 2 – 1. 4. 8. The minimum temperature requirement for FSW of 7020 -T 6 is 400 oC and 6061 -T 6 is 430 oC. However, 7020 -T 6 and 6061 -T 6 softens at lower temperatures than that of the minimum FSW temperature. 7020 -T 6 softens 30 % in 7 min at 250 oC, 4 min at 300 oC, 2 min at 350 oC and 1 min at 400 oC. After softening 30 %, there is 10 % recovery in hardness and the hardness remains constant thereafter. Whereas 6061 -T 6 softens gradually up to 47 % in 7 min at 350 oC and 400 oC, below the temperature of 250 oC for 7020 -T 6 and 350 oC for 6061 -T 6 there is no softening observed in 7 min. 9. The maximum joint efficiency of the 7020 -T 6 weld is 82 % and 6061 -T 6 weld is 60 %. 10. The reduction in joint efficiency is attributed to overaging of the material in the heat affected zone...|$|E
