5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mother is {{characteristic}} of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe sudden {{onset of}} a cue {{triggers}} visual attention, which then enhances visual processing {{in the zone}} near the cue. This enhancement causes a motion illusion in subsequent stimuli presented near the cue. At greater <b>separations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cue, the illusory motion reverses direction, indicating prolonged processing speed. Measurements of the strength and direction of illusory motion at increasing <b>separations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cue reveal an attentional ‘perceptive field’ with an excitatory center at the locus cued and an inhibitory surround subtending the remaining visual field. These findings help explain the traditional attentional ‘benefits’ and ‘costs’ of attention...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{libration}} {{parameters are}} derived for the objects found in 1980 at the triangular libration points of Tethys. The parameters are obtained from an orbit analysis of ground-based and Voyager I data obtained in 1980 for <b>the</b> <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> Saturn along <b>the</b> ring major axis, <b>the</b> projected <b>separations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Tethys L 4 and L 5 points and <b>the</b> <b>separations</b> <b>from</b> Tethys in orbital longitude. The best fitting libration parameters indicate a small (approximately 2 deg) libration amplitude for the L 4 body. Data for the object at the L 5 point may be fit either by orbits with libration amplitudes greater than 50 deg, or with small libration amplitudes, {{which are in}} agreement with recent Voyager II observations...|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century Madagascar had {{the most}} {{developed}} and modern school system in pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period, with French language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers, and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> former colonial power.|$|E
5|$|During {{its first}} decade, {{the newly formed}} Irish Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera {{achieved}} power, he {{took advantage of the}} Statute of Westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted. This completed a process of gradual <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

40|$|Working {{within an}} {{attachment}} perspective, we examined women's success at emotional <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> abusive partners. <b>The</b> attachment patterns of 63 abused women were assessed shortly after having left their abusive relationships. Six months later, their perceptions, feelings, and behaviors regarding the separation were assessed, to determine an {{overall level of}} separation resolution. As expected, attachment patterns associated with a negative self model were overrepresented (88 % of the sample had a predominant pattern of fearful or preoccupied attachment). Further, preoccupation was associated with shorter relationship length, more frequent previous <b>separations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> abusive relationship, continuing emotional involvement with partners after separation, and more frequent sexual contact with partners. These findings suggest that preoccupation may be a risk factor in successful <b>separation</b> resolution <b>from</b> abusive relationships.

5|$|Following Freud's early speculations about infant {{experience}} with the mother, Otto Rank suggested a powerful role in personality development for birth trauma. Rank stressed the traumatic experience of birth as a <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mother, rather than birth as an uncomfortable physical event. Not long after Rank's introduction of this idea, Ian Suttie, a British physician whose early death limited his influence, suggested that the child's basic need is for mother-love, and his greatest anxiety is that such love will be lost.|$|E

Due to the distance of the Bureau of Forestry in Manila from the Forest School in Los Baños (about 64 kilometers), directors of the bureau appointed foresters-in-charge to manage the school, a practice which continued until 1957.|$|E

5|$|The mid-ground shows a crowd scene {{above the}} group of mourners, {{separated}} by two soldiers who stand between the two groupings. The mourners from the foreground {{are reflected in the}} shield carried on the hip of the lance-bearing Roman soldier who leans on the man to his right wearing a red turban. Smith believes this serves to highlight the mourners' emotional and physical <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> assorted figures gathered in the mid-ground. Art historian Adam Labuda sees these two figures, positioned full-length between the chief mourners and mid-ground spectators, as a pictorial device that along with the Magdalene's upward gaze draws viewers' eyes upwards through the panel's dramatic sequence.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Kamo, {{none of the}} {{organizers}} of the robbery were ever brought to trial, and initially it was not clear who was behind the raid, but after the arrest of Kamo, Litvinov and others, the Bolshevik involvement became obvious. The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry; the robbery proved that the Bolshevik Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress. The leader of the Mensheviks, Georgi Plekhanov, called for <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bolsheviks. Plekhanov's colleague, Julius Martov, said the Bolshevik Centre was something between a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang. The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the robbery. The party's investigations into Lenin's conduct were thwarted by the Bolsheviks.|$|E

5|$|On 4 February, {{the team}} beat União de Leiria {{at home by}} 3 goals to 2. Benfica took the lead with a goal from João Tomás. Roger and Van Hooijdonk {{increased}} their lead by two goals, until Nuno Valente settled the final score. With this win, Benfica climbed to second place the league, now only five points behind leader Boavista. On the 16th, Benfica played Estrela da Amadora away from home. The game ended with a 2–1 victory for Benfica. Along with Boavista's loss in Braga, this further reduced Benfica's <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> league leader. Benfica played their last match of February on the 25th against Boavista. Benfica {{had an opportunity to}} take the top place in the league table with a victory in that game, but they were unsuccessful at breaking the 0–0 draw. Van Hooijdonk had the best chance in the 78th minute, but his attempt struck the goalpost.|$|E
5|$|On Elizabeth's {{death in}} 1603 she was succeeded by James I. Strongly {{influenced}} by Scotland's <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church during the Scottish Reformation, James was intensely interested in Protestant theology, focusing {{much of his}} curiosity on the theology of witchcraft. By the early 1590s he had become convinced {{that he was being}} plotted against by Scottish witches. After a visit to Denmark, he had attended the trial in 1590 of the North Berwick witches, who were convicted of using witchcraft to send a storm against the ship that carried James and his wife Anne back to Scotland. In 1597 he wrote a book, Daemonologie, instructing his followers that they must denounce and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft. One year after James acceded to the English throne, a law was enacted imposing the death penalty in cases where it was proven that harm had been caused through the use of magic, or corpses had been exhumed for magical purposes. James was, however, sceptical of the evidence presented in witch trials, even to the extent of personally exposing discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{government}} {{also tried to}} raise revenue through unorthodox means. Early on (in {{the first half of}} 1861), when the support for the <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Union and the military effort was running strong, the donation of coins and gold to the government accounted for about 35% of all sources of government funds. This source, however, dried up over time as individuals and institutions in the South both ran down their personal holdings of bullion and became more unwilling to make donations as war-weariness set in. As a consequence, by the summer of 1862, the share of government revenue coming from these donations fell to less than 1%. Over the course of the entire war this source of revenue contributed only 0.2% of total wartime expenditure.|$|E

5|$|The main {{judicial}} {{officers were}} the Barons of the Exchequer, or barones scaccari, who were originally the same judges {{as those of}} the Court of King's Bench, only becoming independent positions after the Exchequer's <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> curia regis. In {{the early years of the}} Exchequer's existence, the Barons were the chief auditors of the accounts of England, a role passed to dedicated auditors during the reign of Edward II. With the Exchequer's expansion during the Tudor era, the Barons became more important; where previously only the Chief Baron had been appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, with the other Barons mere barristers, it became practice for all Barons of the Exchequer to be Serjeants. This further increased the Exchequer's standing, since for the first time it put the Exchequer at the same level as the Court of Common Pleas and Court of King's Bench, where all judges were already required to be Serjeants.|$|E
5|$|Within its genus, the Iago sparrow {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the African 'rufous sparrows', a group which also includes species such as the great sparrow (Passer motitensis). These birds were usually treated as distinct species until Reginald Ernest Moreau, writing in the 1962 Check-list of the Birds of the World, lumped the Iago sparrow and the mainland rufous sparrows as the single species Passer motitensis. This taxonomy was followed frequently until J. Denis Summers-Smith, a world authority on sparrows, argued in the 1980s that the Iago sparrow's many differences in morphology and behaviour, and <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other rufous sparrows by about , are sufficient grounds for species status. Studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA have since suggested it may be a close relative of the house sparrow and the Spanish sparrow and not the rufous sparrows.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, it {{was decided}} to make Type-0 a PSP exclusive, {{cancelling}} the mobile version of the game as the developers did not want to wait for mobile technology to reach a level which could handle their full vision for the game. Full development began that year by the same team who developed Crisis Core, but was again slowed as most of them were completing work on The 3rd Birthday. Because of these conflicting projects, Type-0 came close to being cancelled outright. Between 2009 and 2011, the title was changed to distance it from Final Fantasy XIII, since after the platform change the two games had little in common other than their shared mythos. One of the titles considered and rejected was Final Fantasy Live, referring to the game's multiplayer element. The new title, Final Fantasy Type-0, was intended to indicate the game's <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main series. It was also the beginning of an alternative numbering system parallel to the main series. The game made its first official public appearance under the new title at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo, along with a new trailer that was released to the public on January 27, 2011.|$|E
