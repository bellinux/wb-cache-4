5|$|Metroid: Zero Mission {{takes place}} on Planet Zebes, a large, {{open-ended}} world with areas connected by doors and elevators. The player controls Samus Aran as she travels through the planet's caverns and environments, hunting Space Pirates. Along the way, the player collects power-ups that enhance Samus's armor and weaponry, as well as grant her special abilities. These abilities allow Samus to access areas that were previously inaccessible, so that the game can be played linearly or non-linearly. For example, the player may come across underground caverns that bypass certain sections, a method termed sequence breaking. To save their progress, players can enter either Save Rooms or Samus's ship on Crateria. As a remake of Metroid, Metroid: Zero Missions layout bears a resemblance to the original, and various powerups and items make reappearances from previous games in the series, with <b>similar</b> <b>uses,</b> effects, and appearances. However, the game adds new items, areas, and mini-bosses, {{as well as a}} completely new area named Chozodia.|$|E

25|$|Amukeke (sun-dried {{slices of}} root) and inginyo (sun-dried crushed root) are a staple food {{for people in}} northeastern Uganda. Amukeke is mainly served for breakfast, eaten with peanut sauce. Inginyo is mixed with cassava flour and {{tamarind}} to make atapa. People eat atapa with smoked fish cooked in peanut sauce or with dried cowpea leaves cooked in peanut sauce. Emukaru (earth-baked root) is eaten as a snack anytime and is mostly served with tea or with peanut sauce. <b>Similar</b> <b>uses</b> are also found in South Sudan.|$|E

25|$|The Dead Sea scrolls {{are first}} century or older {{writings}} {{that show the}} language and customs of some Jews of Jesus' time. Scholars such as Henry Chadwick see the <b>similar</b> <b>uses</b> of languages and viewpoints recorded in the New Testament and the Dead Sea scrolls as valuable in showing that the New Testament portrays the first century period that it reports {{and is not a}} product of a later period. However, the relationship between the Dead Sea scrolls and the historicity of Jesus {{has been the subject of}} highly controversial theories, and although new theories continue to appear, there is no overall scholarly agreement about their impact on the historicity of Jesus, despite the usefulness of the scrolls in shedding light on first-century Jewish traditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Similar</b> <b>uses</b> of {{the city}} are found in movies, where {{it is used to}} {{indicate}} a place a person or good cannot be traced – in a Dutch Donald Duck comic subseries situated in Timbuktu, Donald Duck uses the city as a safe haven, and in the 1970 Disney animated feature The Aristocats, Edgar, the villain of the story, threatens the cats with being sent to Timbuktu only for their friends to rescue them and send Edgar there instead. It is mistakenly noted to be in French Equatorial Africa, instead of French West Africa. Timbuktu provided the main setting for the 1959 film Timbuktu, which was set in the city in 1940 although it was filmed in Kanab, Utah, and for Timbuktu in 2014.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{icon of the}} Virgin Mary, {{of about}} 600 from Saint Catherine's Monastery, has an often overlooked hand, suggesting to Robin Cormack that the emphasis of the subject is on the Incarnation rather than a simple Virgin and Child. Another {{of the very few}} major Eastern works showing the Virgin from before the Byzantine iconoclasm, an apse mosaic (lost in 1922) from Nicaea, also shows the hand above a standing Virgin. Few <b>similar</b> <b>uses</b> of the hand are seen in later Virgins, though the iconographically adventurous Byzantine Chludov Psalter (9th century) has a small miniature showing the hand and dove above a Virgin & Child. The hand occasionally appears in Western Annunciations, even as late as Simone Martini in the 14th century, by which time the dove, sometimes accompanied by a small image of God the Father, has become more common.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, Apple {{filed suit}} against Amazon.com alleging {{trademark}} infringement, unfair competition, and dilution under the Lanham Act and related California state law over Amazon's use of the [...] "App Store" [...] phrase relating to Amazon's [...] "Amazon Appstore Developer Portal" [...] and Amazon's alleged other <b>similar</b> <b>uses</b> of the phrase. In its complaint, Apple did not refer to [...] "apps" [...] as a common name, but described its applications store as a place consumers license [...] "software programs or products"; Amazon countered in its answer that [...] "app store" [...] is a common phrase meaning a [...] "place to buy apps". Reuters reported that Microsoft was opposing Apple's attempted registration of the phrase as a trademark and {{that part of the}} matter was before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB). Apple motioned the court for a preliminary injunction to bar Amazon from using the [...] "App Store" [...] name but, in July 2011, U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton, presiding over Apple's case against Amazon, denied Apple's motion. In July 2012, the case was still in the discovery stage of litigation.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} of Oracle of Seasons and Ages {{is similar}} to that of , copying basic controls, graphics, and sounds from the Game Boy title. Like most The Legend of Zelda titles, exploration and combat take place from an overhead perspective. Link uses a sword for his primary attack, complemented by secondary weapons and items. Basic items, such as bombs and a boomerang, are common to both games. Some new items are exclusive to one game, usually with a counterpart in the other, with <b>similar</b> <b>uses</b> (e.g. the slingshot in Seasons and the seed shooter in Ages both shoot seeds, while the magnetic gloves in Seasons and the switch hook in Ages are used to access otherwise unreachable areas via special targets). [...] Unlike most Zelda titles, a sword and shield is not always equipped when the player possesses them; they can be assigned like any other item into either of two available slots. Most of each of the games is spent finding the eight Essences (Essences of Nature in Seasons and Essences of Time in Ages), each hidden in a dungeon—a large, usually underground, area containing enemies and puzzles. Each dungeon culminates with a boss that guards the Essence.|$|E

[...] Presently it is mainly used for specialized laboratory operations, e.g., the extraction of minerals from various ores. [...] Sodium peroxide may go by the commercial names of Solozone and Flocool. In chemistry preparations, sodium peroxide is used as an oxidizing agent. It is also used as an oxygen source by reacting it with carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and sodium carbonate; it is thus particularly useful in scuba gear, submarines, etc. Lithium peroxide has <b>similar</b> <b>uses.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Whereas {{the orders}} were {{essentially}} structural in Greek architecture, which made little {{use of the}} arch until its late period, in Roman architecture where the arch was often dominant, the orders became increasingly decorative elements except in porticos and <b>similar</b> <b>uses.</b> [...] Columns shrank into half-columns emerging from walls or turned into pilasters. [...] This treatment continued after the conscious and [...] "correct" [...] use of the orders, initially following exclusively Roman models, returned in the Italian Renaissance.

2500|$|Other terms {{often used}} for printed {{engravings}} are copper engraving, copper-plate engraving or line engraving. Steel engraving is the same technique, on steel or steel-faced plates, and was mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and reproductive prints, letterheads and <b>similar</b> <b>uses</b> from about 1790 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less popular, except for banknotes {{and other forms of}} security printing. Especially in the past, [...] "engraving" [...] was often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching or mezzotint. [...] "Hand engraving" [...] is a term sometimes used for engraving objects other than printing plates, to inscribe or decorate jewellery, firearms, trophies, knives and other fine metal goods. Traditional engravings in printmaking are also [...] "hand engraved", using just the same techniques to make the lines in the plate.|$|E
2500|$|Globalization and {{the rise}} of Internet {{technology}} has also facilitated sex trafficking. Online classified sites and social networks such as Craigslist have been under intense scrutiny for being used by johns and traffickers in facilitating sex trafficking and sex work in general. Traffickers use explicit sites and underground sites (e.g. Craigslist, Backpage, MySpace) to market, recruit, sell, and exploit females. Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites are suspected for <b>similar</b> <b>uses.</b> For example, Randal G. Jennings was convicted of sex trafficking five underage girls by forcing them to advertise on Craigslist and driving them to meet the customers. [...] According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, online classified ads reduce the risks of finding prospective customers. Studies have identified the Internet as the single biggest facilitator of commercial sex trade, although it is difficult to ascertain which women advertised are sex trafficking victims. Traffickers and pimps use the Internet to recruit minors, since Internet and social networking sites usage have significantly increased especially among children.|$|E
