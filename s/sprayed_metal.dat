The present report gives the results of reflectivity and bond strength measurements on some 300 specimens of mild steel blasted under a number of different conditions by three suppliers. Reflectivity measurements again showed 'that specimens prepared by any one supplier could be placed in a series of increasing reflectivity, although some difficulties were still encountered in relating the result of different suppliers. These difficulties were most marked with specimens blasted with worn grit.
