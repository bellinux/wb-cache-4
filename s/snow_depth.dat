5|$|Because of its remote {{location}} and relative inaccessibility, climate records are poor. The nearest weather station, Potato Hill, {{has only been}} measuring precipitation since 1982 and temperatures since 1989. Temperature and precipitation records from Glenwood and Trout Lake, both considerably lower in elevation and farther from the mountain, are more complete and go back further, 1948 at Glenwood and 1924 at Trout Lake. Snowfall records from the three snow stations on Adams cover {{a number of years}} but are discontinuous and are limited to the northwest side. The Potato Hill station was monitored monthly from 1950-1976 and was replaced in 1982 with the automated precipitation sensor. It was upgraded in 1983 to report snow water equivalent and it was upgraded again in 2006 to report <b>snow</b> <b>depth.</b> The Council Pass station was monitored monthly from 1956-1978 and the Divide Meadow station was monitored monthly from 1962-1978. Divide Meadow was the most representative of the <b>snow</b> <b>depth</b> {{on the west side of}} Adams because it was the highest station on the flanks of the mountain.|$|E
5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced {{up the side}} of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting of air {{up the side of}} a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that <b>snow</b> <b>depth</b> and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E
5|$|Satellite {{observations}} {{record a}} decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellites when satellite observations began. In some areas, including China, snow cover has increased. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover has been observed from 1978 to 2006. These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less aea coverage. However, in some areas {{there may be an}} increase in <b>snow</b> <b>depth</b> because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40°. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.|$|E

5|$|Its {{population}} in Canada is limited due to both <b>snow</b> <b>depth</b> {{and the presence}} of the Canadian lynx. The bobcat does not tolerate deep snow, and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas; it lacks the large, padded feet of the Canadian lynx and cannot support its weight on snow as efficiently. The bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement of the Canadian lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in Nova Scotia, while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the Canadian lynx's range to the advantage of the bobcat. In northern and central Mexico, the cat is found in dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country.|$|E
5|$|When hunting large prey, {{the coyote}} often works in pairs or small groups. Success in killing large {{ungulates}} depends on {{factors such as}} <b>snow</b> <b>depth</b> and crust density. Younger animals usually avoid participating in such hunts, with the breeding pair typically {{doing most of the}} work. Unlike the wolf, which attacks large prey from the rear, the coyote approaches from the front, lacerating its prey's head and throat. Like other canids, the coyote caches excess food. Coyotes catch mouse-sized rodents by pouncing, whereas ground squirrels are chased. Although coyotes can live in large groups, small prey is typically caught singly. Coyotes have been observed to kill porcupines in pairs, using their paws to flip the rodents on their backs, then attacking the soft underbelly. Only old and experienced coyotes can successfully prey on porcupines, with many predation attempts by young coyotes resulting in them being injured by their prey's quills. Coyotes sometimes urinate on their food, possibly to claim ownership over it.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used methods to map and measure snow extent, <b>snow</b> <b>depth</b> and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, {{which has led to}} other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, {{it is important to have}} continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.|$|E
50|$|Snow {{cover in}} several regions (Svaneti and {{northern}} Abkhazia) may reach 5 m. The Mt. Achishkho region, {{which is the}} snowiest place in the Caucasus, often records <b>snow</b> <b>depths</b> of 7 m.|$|R

25|$|Lake {{freeze-up}} {{depends on}} the heat storage in the lake and therefore on its depth, the rate and temperature of any inflow, and water-air energy fluxes. Information on lake depth is often unavailable, although some indication of the depth of shallow lakes in the Arctic {{can be obtained from}} airborne radar imagery during late winter (Sellman et al. 1975) and spaceborne optical imagery during summer (Duguay and Lafleur 1997). The timing of breakup is modified by <b>snow</b> <b>depth</b> on the ice as well as by ice thickness and freshwater inflow.|$|E

40|$|Numerical models {{face the}} {{challenge}} of representing the present-day spatiotemporal distribution of snow on sea ice realistically. We present modeled Arctic-wide <b>snow</b> <b>depths</b> on sea ice (hs_mod) obtained with the MITgcm configured with a single snow layer that accumulates proportionally to the thickness of sea ice. When compared to <b>snow</b> <b>depths</b> derived from radar measurements (NASA Operation IceBridge, 2009 – 2013), the model <b>snow</b> <b>depths</b> are overestimated on first-year ice (2. 5 ± 8. 1 cm) and multiyear ice (0. 8 ± 8. 3 cm). The large variance between model and observations lies mainly in the limitations of the model snow scheme and the large uncertainties in the radar measurements. In a temporal analysis, during the peak of snowfall accumulation (April), hs_mod show a decline between 2000 and 2013 associated to long-term reduction of summer sea ice extent, surface melting and sublimation. With the aim of gaining knowledge on how to improve hs_mod, we investigate the contribution of the explicitly modeled snow processes to the resulting hs_mod. Our analysis reveals that this simple snow scheme offers a practical solution to general circulation models due to its ability to replicate robustly the distribution of the large-scale Arctic <b>snow</b> <b>depths.</b> However, benefit can be gained from the integration of explicit wind redistribution processes to potentially improve the model performance and to better understand the interaction between sources and sinks of contemporary Arctic snow. 現在の海氷上における積雪の時空間分布を現実的に表現するという課題に数値モデルの研究は直面している。我々は、海氷厚に比例して堆積する単一の積雪層で構成されたMITgcmを入れた北極域海氷上の広域積雪モデル(hs_mod) を提示した。レーダー観測（NASA Operation IceBridge、 2009 - 2013 ）に基づく積雪深と比較すると、一年氷（ 2. 5 ± 8. 1 cm）と多年氷（ 0. 8 ± 8. 3 cm）ではモデル積雪深が過大評価される。モデルと観測の大きな違いは、主にモデル化した積雪スキームの限界と、レーダー観測の大きな不確実性にある。積算降雪量ピーク(4 月) の間、hs_modは、長期的な夏の海氷、表面融解および昇華蒸発の減少に関連して、 2000 年から 2013 年の期間中、減少を示した。hs_modを改善する方法に関する知識を得る目的で、明示的にモデル化された積雪プロセスのhs_mod出力への寄与を調べた。我々の研究によって、広域な北極域の積雪深分布を確実に復元する能力があるため、この単純な積雪スキームが、全球気候モデルに実用的な解を算出できることが明らかとなった。しかしながら、明示的な風による再配分プロセスを導入することで、さらにモデル性能を潜在的に改善し、同時期の北極域積雪における発生源と消耗源との相互作用をよりよく理解することができる...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} snow as a {{resource}} has considerably increased in Swiss mountain regions, in particular {{in the context of}} winter tourism. In the perspective of a warming climate, it is thus important to quantify the potential changes in snow amount and duration that could have large repercussions on the economy of ski resorts. Because of the fine spatial variability of snow, the use of a Surface Energy Balance Model (SEBM) is adequate to simulate local snow cover evolution. A perturbation method has been developed to generate plausible future meteorological input data required for SEBM simulations in order to assess the changes in snow cover patterns. Current and future <b>snow</b> <b>depths</b> have also been simulated within the ski areas themselves. The results show a large decrease of the <b>snow</b> <b>depths</b> and duration, even at high elevation in a warmer climate and emphasize the sensitivity of snow to topographical characteristics of the resorts. The most vulnerable areas would be the Western regions of Switzerland or the Eastern Prealps whereas the Central Alps or Valais would be less affected. The study highlights the fact that not only the altitude of a domain but also its exposure, localization inland and slope gradients need {{to be taken into account}} when evaluating current and future <b>snow</b> <b>depths.</b> This method enables a precise assessment of the snow pattern over a small area...|$|R
25|$|Storm {{spotting}} {{developed in}} the United States during the early 1940s. A joint project {{between the military and}} the weather bureau saw the deployment of trained military and aviation lightning spotters in areas where ammunitions for the war were manufactured. During 1942, a serious tornado struck a key operations center in Oklahoma and another tornado on May 15, 1943 destroyed parts of the Fort Riley military base located in Kansas. After these two events and a string of other tornado outbreaks, spotter networks became commonplace, and it is estimated that there were over 200 networks by 1945. Their mandate had also changed to include reporting all types of active or severe weather; this included giving <b>snow</b> <b>depth</b> and other reports during the winter as well as fire reports in the summer, along with the more typical severe weather reports associated with thunderstorms. However, spotting was still mainly carried out by trained individuals in either the military, aviation, or law enforcement fields of service. It was not until 1947 that volunteer spotting, as it exists today, was born.|$|E
