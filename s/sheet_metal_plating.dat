40|$|Abstract: The {{economy of}} the process for the {{manufacture}} of parts from <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>plates</b> depends on successful solution {{of the process of}} cutting various parts from <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>plates.</b> Essentially, the problem is to arrange contours within a defined space so that they take up minimal surface. When taken in this way, the considered problem assumes a more general nature; it refers to the utilization of a flat surface, and it can represent a general principle of arranging 2 D contours on a certain surface. The paper presents a conceptual solution and a prototypal intelligent nesting system for optimal cutting. The problem of nesting can generally be divided into two intellectual phases: recognition and classification of shapes, and arrangement of recognized shapes on a given surface. In solving these problems, methods of artificial intelligence are applied. In the paper, trained neural network is used for recognition of shapes; on the basis of raster record of a part's drawing, it recognizes the part's shape and which class it belongs to. By means of the expert system, based on rules defined on the basis of acquisition of knowledge from manufacturing sections, {{as well as on the}} basis of certain mathematical algorithms, parts are arranged on the arrangement surface. Both systems can also work independently, having been built on the modular principle. The system uses various product models as elements of integration for the entire system...|$|R

Joint material, bolt preload level, and the amplitude level of the cyclic bending moment are studied for their effect on the fatigue life of the clamped <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>plate.</b> Bolt tightening to a precise preload level is accomplished by using an ultrasonic instrument that has been mechanically pre-calibrated to convert the time delay of longitudinal ultrasonic wave reflection to a bolt elongation and corresponding preload value. Fatigue data is generated using an MTS fatigue testing system. Experimental and FEA results are fitted into a multi-axial model for predicting the fatigue behavior of the bolted joint. Discussion and data analysis are provided...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Fraunhofer IPT {{recently}} {{developed a new}} hybrid laser-assisted shearing process which enables conventional punching machines to produce punched sheared edges with continuous flush-cut surfaces in stainless steel plates (1. 4301), spring steel plates (1. 4310) and titanium alloy plates (3. 7165). The new combination of localised laser-induced softening of the plate material in the shearing zone and the shearing process significantly reduces both process forces and process-related noise emissions. A modular system-upgrade for existing punching machines allows laser-assisted shearing to be implemented {{without the need for}} expensive new machine designs. The principle of the laser-assisted shearing process is based on briefly and selectively heating the material in the shearing zone via local absorption of laser radiation {{on the underside of the}} <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> before the punching tool comes into contact on the upper side of the <b>metal</b> <b>plate.</b> Laser-induced heating softens the material in the shearing zone within the material within a few tenths of a second.

Many comparisons between experiments and FE computations of bird impacts onto aluminium riveted panels have shown that macroscopic plastic strains were not sufficiently developed (and localised) in the riveted shell FE in the impact area. Consequently, FE models never succeed in initialising and propagating the rupture in the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>plates</b> and along rivet rows as shown by experiments, without calibrating the input data (especially the damage and failure properties of the riveted shell FE). To model the assembly correctly, it appears necessary to investigate on FE techniques such as Hybrid-Trefftz finite element method (H-T FEM). Indeed, perforated FE plates developed for elastic problems, based on a Hybrid-Trefftz formulation, {{have been found in}} the open literature.
