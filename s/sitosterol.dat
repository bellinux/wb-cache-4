40|$|Abstract Seeds of Raphanus sativus L. {{subjected}} to accelerated ageing were investigated for {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) release and for content of vitamin E (tocopherol, TOC, and tocotrienol, TOC- 3), fatty acids and phytosterols in seed coats, cotyledons and embryonic axes during germination. In unaged seeds, ROS release occurred mainly in seed coats of non-imbibed seeds and in seedlings (48 h of imbibition). TOC and TOC- 3 were mainly represented by the c-isoform, abundant in embryonic axes. Fatty acids were mainly found in cotyledons. In seed coat and embryonic axis, phytosterols consisted mainly of <b>sitosterols.</b> The effects of ageing were mainly visible in embryonic axes at 48 h of imbibition. Deterioration {{was associated with a}} decrease in fresh weight increase percentage, germination percentage, a-TOC and total fatty acid content.

This review describes the botanical characterization and distribution, as well as critically assesses the phytochemical properties and biological activities of E. creticum, a species that has been used in traditional medicine for many decades.

E. creticum has been found to contain several chemical constituents, mostly sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, aldehydes, coumarins, <b>sitosterols</b> and sugars. Eryngo with its bioactive compounds possesses a wild range of biological activities.

40|$|Note: One foldout was bound, {{could not}} be scanned. Since the {{disposal}} of by-product bark in logging operations is often a serious problem in the wood pulp industry, advantageous methods of bark utilization are of definite interest. A partial {{solution to this problem}} has been obtained in the production of marketable products by mechanical processing of bark but more recently the possibility of extracting economically valuable products with solvents has received some attention. In investigations along these lines interest has been centered in the ether and alcohol soluble fractions, perhaps because these solvents extract material of greater potential economic value such as fats, waxes, resins or <b>sitosterols.</b> Another reason for the slight amount of interest in the aqueous extract might possibly be that most of the substances extracted by water, such as tannins and polysaccharides, are amorphous mixtures, whereas ether and alcohol extract compounds whose lower molecular weight improves the chance of sharp separation and definite identification. Since the percentage amount of any chemical individual in extracts of bark is generally small, investigators in this field have had considerable difficulty in identifying the constituents. This disadvantage was overcome in the present investigation by using an unusually large amount of starting material.

50|$|Sitosterolemia is {{inherited}} as a rare {{autosomal recessive}} condition. It {{has been shown}} to result from mutations in either of two adjacent and oppositely oriented genes (ABCG5 and ABCG8) located in chromosome 2 in band 2p21 and encode for ABC transporter proteins named sterolin-1 and sterolin-2, respectively. Thus, the active pumping back into the intestine of passively absorbed plant sterols is disrupted, and hepatic secretion of the resultant accumulation of these sterols is decreased. The ability of the liver to preferentially excrete plant sterols into the bile is apparently impaired. While bile acid synthesis remains the same as in healthy people, the total excretion of sterols in the bile is reportedly less than 50% in subjects with sitosterolemia compared to control subjects. The mechanism for decreased hepatic secretion is unknown. Patients have markedly reduced whole-body cholesterol biosynthesis associated with suppressed hepatic, ileal, and mononuclear leukocyte hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), the rate-controlling enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Whether or not the down-regulation is due to accumulated <b>sitosterol</b> is still debatable, but most recent data indicate that secondary effects of unknown regulators other than <b>sitosterol</b> can lead to reduced HMG-CoA reductase activity in the disease. This is coupled with significantly increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression.|$|E
