The {{transportation}} vehicle growth {{quicker than}} the road infrastructure growth results in traffic flow distraction; therefore traffic jam occurs particularly {{when there is}} no effective regulation. The regulation using traffic sign is the most effective one when the traffic volume in a relatively dense intersection. This final project aimed to conduct the analysis on the performance of <b>Signed</b> <b>Intersection</b> Behind UNS, to make improvement, and to estimate the Cost Budget Plan and time schedule. The method of research employed were field survey to get primary data, while the secondary data was collected from several institutions. The data included traffic volume, geometry and unit price, that were then processed using Highway Capacity Manual Project (MKJI) 1997 and Microsoft Excel 2007. Several indicators of analysis result in <b>signed</b> <b>intersection</b> behind UNS were degree of saturation, length of queue, postponement. From the result of analysis, the <b>signed</b> <b>intersection</b> Jl. Solo - Wonogiri had degree of saturation value on Thursday was 0. 826 for Jl. Solo – Wonogiri (North), 0. 746 for Jl. Solo – Wonogiri (South), 2. 461 for Jl. Ciu, and 3, 508 for Jl. Perumahan vicinities. Meanwhile, on intersection Jl. Gatot Subroto – Jl. Kh Samanhudi, the degree of saturation was 1. 165 for Jl. Veteran Timur, 2. 247 for Jl. Veteran Barat, and 1. 265 for Jl. Kh Samanhudi vicinities. The improvement made included to change the cycle time for both of <b>intersection,</b> “no parking” <b>sign</b> and to renovate the mark. The cost needed for such the improvement was IDR 45, 858, 687. Keywords: <b>Signed</b> <b>Intersection</b> Performance, MKJI 1997, RAB...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTravel {{efficiency}} and traffic safety of unsignalized intersections {{are two main}} objectives considered in traffic management and control. Stop sign and yield sign {{are the most common}} traffic signs to display the right of the way for all direction vehicle flows of unsignalized intersections. While in most cities in China, signalized control are always adopted for all intersections without considering level of traffic flow volume. This paper analyzes the difference between the stop <b>sign</b> <b>intersection</b> and yield <b>sign</b> <b>intersection</b> from the aspects of delay analysis. Firstly, intersections are designed in VISSIM software and traffic flow performance is validated via VISSIM. Then average vehicular delay under different traffic volumes is analysed under stop sign and yield sign respectively. Taking the lowest delay as the optimal objective, the critical traffic volume is proposed to set stop sign or yield sign. The results can be used in practice to guide the installation of traffic signs...|$|R
40|$|STOP {{signs are}} often {{physically}} blocked by obstacles at the corner, forming a safety threat. To enhance the safety at an un-signalized intersection like a STOP <b>sign</b> <b>intersection,</b> a {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) based drivers smart advisory system (DSAS) was developed, which provides drivers with an earlier warning message when they are approaching an un-signalized intersection. In this research, a pilot field test was conducted with the DSAS alarm on an approach towards a STOP <b>sign</b> <b>intersection</b> in a residential area in Houston, Texas. The designed test route covers all turning movements, including left turn, through movement, and right turn. GPS units recorded test drivers' driving behaviors. A self-developed MATLAB program and statistically significant difference t-test were applied to analyze the impacts of the DSAS messages on drivers' driving performance, in terms of approaching speed profile, acceleration/deceleration rates, braking distance, and possible extra vehicle emissions induced {{by the introduction of}} the DSAS message. Drivers' preference on the DSAS was investigated by a designed survey questionnaire among test drivers. Results showed that the DSAS alarm was able to induce drivers to drive significantly slower to approach a STOP <b>sign</b> <b>intersection,</b> perform smaller fluctuation in acceleration/deceleration rates, and be more aware of a coming STOP sign indicated by decelerating earlier. All test drivers preferred to follow the DSAS alarm on roads for a safety concern. Further, the DSAS alarm caused the reduction in emission rates through movement. For a general observation, more road tests with more participants and different test routes were recommended...|$|R
