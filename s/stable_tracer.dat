FDG-PET uses a radiolabeled glucose analogue with the positron-emitting radioactive isotope fluorine- 18 substituted for a normal hydroxyl group in the glucose molecule. A substrate for hexokinase-associated phosphorylation, the phosphorylated FDG molecule is trapped within the cell and provides a mechanism for relatively <b>stable</b> <b>tracer</b> accumulation [15]. Notably, an experimental advantage of studying lung regeneration is that the low baseline consumption of glucose provided a useful contrast between control and regenerating lungs.|$|E
40|$|Diffusion {{is often}} {{neglected}} in water resource hydrogeology or solute transport, {{but may be}} the dominant process that affects hydrogeochemistry and tracers. Tracers give misleading results if diffusion into aquitards, matrix pores of fractured rocks, blind fractures or other low conductivity zones is ignored. Traditional methods of measuring diffusion coefficients in small slices from heterogeneous rock are unsuitable for scaling up. This study introduces an alternative radioactive <b>stable</b> <b>tracer</b> method for characterising diffusion based on larger lab-scale drill-core tracer tests and field-scale borehole tracer tests. Radiohalides 131 I (half-life 8 days) or 82 Br (half-life 1. 5 days) were compared to their stable equivalent (I or Br) diffusing radially into 45 - 50 cm lengths of 60 mm diameter drill cores. Due to radioactive decay, Ficks laws indicate that short-lived radiotracers trend towards steady-state diffusive flux into stagnant zones as sinks, where stable tracers trend towards zero flux. With repeated tracer injections, minimum diffusive loss is therefore quantified as the difference between normalised radiotracer loss (1 At/A 0) and <b>stable</b> <b>tracer</b> loss (1 Ct/C 0). The range of possible diffusive losses [(0. 5 + Ct/C 0  At/A 0) ± (0. 5 - 0. 5 Ct/C 0) ] converges with repeated injections. Equivalent effective diffusion coefficients, D* and De, were derived by modifying existing numerical models. The radioactive <b>stable</b> <b>tracer</b> method and numerical model were also used for a single borehole within a fractured sandstone aquifer using 82 Br Br tracers. The normally confounding field factors such as dilution, advection, exchange, adsorption and precipitation processes identically affect the isotopes, whereas diffusive losses alter radioactive stable isotope ratios. Diffusive loss was constrained to 13 ± 6 % per day after only three injections, without requiring fracture parameters or porosity. A case study of diffusive effects on groundwater age tracers 3 H and 14 C was explored using the above and results from a novel zone-of-interest groundwater sampler (ZoIGS). Diffusive losses are normally a sink that leads to overestimation of mean groundwater age. However, results indicated that here diffusion simultaneously caused both underestimation of 3 H age and overestimation of 14 C age. Quantifying diffusion with this method in heterogeneous or fractured aquifers improves the interpretation of age tracer transport and hence assessments of water resources...|$|E
5000|$|Isotopic tracers {{are usually}} {{subdivided}} into two categories: <b>stable</b> isotope <b>tracers</b> and radiogenic isotope <b>tracers.</b> <b>Stable</b> isotope <b>tracers</b> involve only non-radiogenic isotopes and usually are mass-dependent.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to "weightless" radioactive <b>tracers,</b> <b>stable</b> isotope <b>tracers</b> have nonnegligible mass and are naturally {{present in the}} system, and the measured variable is a ratio of two isotopic species. These features do not allow <b>stable</b> isotopic <b>tracer</b> data analysis using straightforward analogy with radioactive tracer approaches, even though this practice is common. In this study, we present kinetic variables, models, and measurements for the analysis and interpretation of <b>stable</b> isotope <b>tracer</b> data. Assumptions and mathematical techniques for modeling the data when perturbation is both nonnegligible and negligible are discussed. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} rich information content of the dynamic portion of a <b>stable</b> isotope <b>tracer</b> curve and on the role of compartmental and noncompartmental modeling approaches for its interpretation. A presumed and commonly used analogy between the radioactive specific activity and stable isotopic enrichment is shown to be incorrect. We show that the proper analogue of specific activity is the tracer-to-tracee molar ratio. This variable is not a directly measurable one, but a formula is derived that allows its computation from the data. A method for reconstructing the time course in blood of the concentration component due to endogenous synthesis is presented. This allows measurement of the extent of the perturbation in the case where a nonweightless tracer is used. Special attention is given to data analysis originating from a multiple tracer experiment, a configuration necessary for studying more complex systems, e. g., the kinetics of interacting substrates...|$|R

Before iodination a minor tetramer fraction may be demonstrable in iron-saturated Lf only. Iodination-induced polymerization of iron-poor as well as iron-saturated Lf occurs independently of {{the presence or absence}} of 10 mM-EDTA and the 125 I-/Lf molar ratio used for iodination. 125 I-Lf polymers are mainly covalently linked, as suggested by the lack of substantial dissociation in SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Damage to the 125 I-Lf monomer may be another consequence of oxidative iodination. This is demonstrated in SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis where 50 % of the radioactivity of apparently normal monomer (Mr 75, 000) is displaced to a lower-Mr region (30, 000 - 67, 000) after reduction with dithiothreitol.

The results showed obvious spatial variations of both water isotope values along the river flow direction, and significant seasonal variation occurred within the river water isotopes. This indicated that different proportions of rain and melt water entering river water should lead to spatial variation, and for mid-stream and downstream regions, the transformation relationship between surface water and groundwater should consider less input of melt water.

To evaluate sucrose as a tracer for leakage testing for various filling materials involved in endodontic treatment. Materials and methodsThe stability of sucrose and glucose was examined by immersing 11 common filling materials (1. 5  ×  3  mm blocks, cured for 1 week at 37 °C in 100 % relative humidity; n =  10 for each) in a 10 mM solution of either sucrose or glucose. The concentration of the solution was measured after 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of immersion and compared. Then, the two tracers were used to test the sealing ability of zinc oxide–eugenol cement (IRM) and amalgam root-end fillings. Each material (n =  40 for each) was equally divided into two subgroups, these were evaluated with either glucose or sucrose as the tracer substance, and the amount of leakage was determined after 24  h, and 1 week, 2 weeks, 3  weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks. ResultsSucrose was stable with all materials at all time points. The concentration of glucose had significantly diminished after 1 week of immersion with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) or Sealapex (P    0. 05).

Substantial variation in quantitative methods to measure brain amyloid burden exists in the field. The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of methodological variations to the quantification of amyloid burden using data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer’s Network (DIAN), an autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease population. Cross-sectional and longitudinal [11 C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET imaging data from the DIAN study were analyzed. Four candidate reference regions were investigated for estimation of brain amyloid burden. A regional spread function based technique was also investigated for the correction of partial volume effects. Cerebellar cortex, brain-stem, and white matter regions all had <b>stable</b> <b>tracer</b> retention during the course of disease. Partial volume correction consistently improves sensitivity to group differences and longitudinal changes over time. White matter referencing improved statistical power in the detecting longitudinal changes in relative tracer retention; however, the reason for this improvement is unclear and requires further investigation. Full dynamic acquisition and kinetic modeling improved statistical power although it may add cost and time. Several technical variations to amyloid burden quantification were examined in this study. Partial volume correction emerged as the strategy that most consistently improved statistical power for the detection of both longitudinal changes and across-group differences. For the autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease population with PiB imaging, utilizing brainstem as a reference region with partial volume correction may be optimal for current interventional trials.

However, the impact of path physiological elevations in leptin on homocysteine metabolism is not fully illustrated. The objective {{of the study was}} to investigate the impact of elevated leptin on homocysteine metabolism and methyl group kinetics in vivo. Effects of long-term leptin administration on homocysteine transmethylation and transsulfuration metabolic fluxes were investigated in mouse models using <b>stable</b> isotopic <b>tracers</b> and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Homocysteine remethylation and transsulfuration metabolic fluxes were investigated using <b>stable</b> isotopic <b>tracers</b> and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The methylation status was determined. Our preliminary in vivo study indicated that long-term leptin administration altered homocysteine metabolism in a tissue specific manner. 本研究室近期在體外研究發現胰島素對於細胞內同半胱胺酸代謝影響顯著。另外也發現當細胞暴露在高糖情況時其同半胱氨酸轉硫反應會受到抑制而其再甲基化代謝路徑會促進而提腺甘甲硫氨酸合成。除血糖及胰島素異常，人類的第二型糖尿病常伴隨高瘦體素血症。瘦體素是一種脂肪細胞生成的細胞激素。有研究顯示瘦體素在代謝症候群的發展過程中可能扮演獨立的角色，然而瘦體素如何影響同半胱胺酸代謝以及甲基動態平衡目前尚未闡明。本研究以動物模式長期介入生理劑量的瘦體素探討其對於同半胱胺酸代謝影響，並以同位素及氣相層析質譜儀分析體內實驗中瘦體素如何影響同半胱胺酸轉硫及轉甲基代謝分流，並對於體內長期暴露在瘦體素狀況時甲基族動態平衡做全面性探討。同半胱胺酸代謝異常是心血管疾病獨立危險因子之一。細胞內的同半胱胺酸可透過再甲基化作用合成甲硫胺酸或是經轉硫作用降解。本研究對於釐清糖尿病或代謝症候群或其他高瘦體素血症狀況對於體內同半胱胺酸轉甲基與轉硫代謝機轉之影響有所貢獻。目錄	iii Introduction	 1 Materials and Methods	 4 RESULTS	 11 Discussion	 16 Conclusion	 18 References	 4...|$|R
40|$|Dietary sugar consumption, in {{particular}} sugar-sweetened beverages and the monosaccharide fructose, {{has been linked}} to the incidence and severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Intervention studies in both animals and humans have shown large doses of fructose to be particularly lipogenic. While fructose does stimulate de novo lipogenesis (DNL), <b>stable</b> isotope <b>tracer</b> studies in humans demonstrate quantitatively that the lipogenic effect of fructose is not mediated exclusively by its provision of excess substrates for DNL. The deleterious metabolic effects of high fructose loads appear to be a consequence of altered transcriptional regulatory networks impacting intracellular macronutrient metabolism and altering signaling and inflammatory processes. Uric acid generated by fructose metabolism may also contribute to or exacerbate these effects. Here we review data from human and animal intervention and <b>stable</b> isotope <b>tracer</b> studies relevant to the role of dietary sugars on NAFLD development and progression, in the context of typical sugar consumption patterns and dietary recommendations worldwide. We conclude that the use of hypercaloric, supra-physiological doses in intervention trials has been a major confounding factor and whether or not dietary sugars, including fructose, at typically consumed population levels, effect hepatic lipogenesis and NAFLD pathogenesis in humans independently of excess energy remains unresolved...|$|R
40|$|The {{age of a}} water mass {{is often}} {{estimated}} experimentally using the radio-age computed from the distribution of a radioactive tracer (radiocarbon, helium-tritium). Deleersnijder et al. [J. Mar. Syst. 28 (2001) 229. ] {{have shown that the}} radio-age underestimates the age of the water and is larger than the age of the radioactive tracer used for its evaluation. This result is generalized here to radio-ages computed from the ratio of two radioactive tracers. The differences between the different ages are also studied analytically and numerically as functions of the decay rate of the radioactive tracers. For small decay rates, the difference between the age of the water mass and the radio-age is shown to be proportional to the decay rate. It depends also on the level of mixing in the system; even radioactive tracers with small decay rates can provide poor estimates of the age of the water mass in a strongly diffusive flow. For small half lives, both the radio-age and the age of radioactive tracers decrease as the inverse of the square root of the decay rate. The same analysis applies to some extent to the estimates of the age of a water mass from <b>stable</b> <b>tracers</b> with known time dependent sources (e. g. chloroflurocarbons) ...|$|R
