40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the paper}} is to study the {{relationship}} of individuals’ <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> consumption to personal income and relative sport price in Hungary in the period 1992 - 2006. It is shown, that the trend of the real <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> consumption in conjunction with real income decreased till 2000 {{and it has been}} increasing since then. Income and price elasticity figures for both periods show, that <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> consumption is price elastic, and <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> are luxury goods for Hungarian households. Thus, without increased income – i. e. the average standard of living – a more sport conscious Hungarian population can hardly be imagined even if <b>sport</b> <b>goods</b> remained relatively cheap.

25|$|In {{his youth}} he often played with Ken Rosewall {{and they became}} known as the Sydney 'twins', {{although}} they had very different physiques, personalities and playing styles. Their first match was in their early teens and was played as an opener of an exhibition match between Australia and America. Rosewall won 6–0, 6–0. Hoad built up great physical strength, especially in his hands and arms, by training at a police boys' club, where he made a name as a boxer. Hoad was about 12 when he was introduced to Adrian Quist, a former Australian tennis champion and then general manager of the Dunlop <b>sports</b> <b>goods</b> company. Quist played a couple of sets with Hoad and was impressed by his natural ability. When Hoad was 14 he left school and joined the Dunlop payroll, following the pattern of that 'shamateur' era when most of Australia's brightest tennis prospects were employed by sporting goods companies.|$|E
25|$|A {{club for}} cricket was opened in 1877 at Longwood Estate, a place {{named after the}} house Napoleon Bonaparte stayed at while exiled to Saint Helena. Located on the {{outskirts}} of Boston, cricketers and baseball players put Longwood on the sports map. Specifically, Harry Wright, first player-manager of the Boston Red Stockings, played cricket for the United States, as did his brother George Wright. George Wright combined with tennis pro Charlie Chambers in league games throughout New England and played at Longwood against Lord Harris' XI in 1891. George Wright was the co-proprietor of Wright and Ditman, purveyor of fine <b>sports</b> <b>goods.</b> Wright brought the first tennis gear to Boston on his return from a baseball-cricket tour of England in 1874. Wright also taught tennis to Harvard students and toured with them in California in 1890. It was George Wright who deserves the credit for Longwood's broad-based sporting tradition, having excelled in baseball and cricket as a paid professional and at tennis as an imaginative promoter of the game. A lawn tennis court was laid in 1878, two years after the organization of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Lord's Cricket Ground in London. On January 5, 1888, Longwood member and US cricket team captain C.L. Bixby led the team to a win over the West Indies cricket team at the Bourda ground in Georgetown, Guyana. Richard D. Sears, who won seven United States Championships, would soon become a club member as well.|$|E
