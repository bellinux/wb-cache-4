25|$|Sarah Dozier, Johnston's niece, filed {{a motion}} asking a federal judge for {{sanctions}} against the city of Atlanta because <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> had withheld documents in a wrongful death lawsuit.

According to Dozier's motion, Lawyers for Johnston's family had asked the Atlanta Police Department for documents about the quotas before the trial began; the police chief had denied the existence of the quota system and the department indicated that there were no such documents. Dozier's motion claims that her lawyers obtained the documents another way and that APD officers had verified their authenticity during pretrial testimony. Alex White, the man the officers had used as their informant, also filed a lawsuit against Atlanta and police, claiming officers had held him against his will to pressure him to lie for the cover-up. In August 2010, Johnston's family was awarded $4.9 million in a settlement.|$|E
