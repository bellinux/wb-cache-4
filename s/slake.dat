500|$|To <b>slake</b> the thirst of its ever-growing population, {{which had}} reached almost 100,000 by 1915, Yonkers tapped the Saw Mill. Water from an {{impoundment}} two miles (3.2km) {{north of downtown}} was held in two reservoirs and two water towers. It was purified by slow filtration through sand and then chlorinated.

[...] Development of the Cowpen Quay and Waterloo areas began in about 1810 and 1815 respectively, and between the 1850s and 1890s major house building took place in these areas. [...] Blyth railway station, first built in 1847, was relocated in 1867 and rebuilt in 1896, {{to cope with the}} increase in goods and passenger traffic. [...] The 1890s saw the filling in of [...] "the Slake" [...] (also known as [...] "the Flanker" [...] or [...] "the Gut"). [...] The <b>Slake</b> was a tidal inlet which stretched south from the river, across the site of today's bus station, along the route of Beaconsfield Street, and on past Crofton Mill Pit. [...] Before it was filled in, it almost entirely separated Blyth from Cowpen—Waterloo Bridge providing the only main link. [...] Once it was removed, the two areas could combine and allow the town to begin to take its present form. [...] The town continued to expand in the 20th century; much large-scale house building took place in the 1920s and 1930s, and from the 1950s to the 1970s.|$|E

There were no more assaults on the Portuguese siege camp. [...] The truce was observed from Sunday, October 13 onwards.|$|E

They are impermeable to root and water, and {{considered one of the}} major soil limitations for agriculture development. This study was undertaken to chemically characterize these layers in a representative profiles collected from both Al-Qasseem and Al-Ahsa regions using chemical extraction methods. Results indicate that HCl was the most effective solution in <b>slaking</b> the clods of the indurated layers of Al-Qasseem region. No <b>slaking</b> in water or NaOH was observed in the indurated layers except few samples. Sodium citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite (CBD) extract indicated low to moderate <b>slaking</b> of the dried clods, while other extracts resulted in no <b>slaking,</b> slight <b>slaking</b> or low to moderate <b>slaking</b> of the indurated layers. Results of dissolution indicated that, calcium carbonate was the main cementing material with or without varying proportions of amorphous silica, free iron oxides, and amorphous alumina. Results of <b>slaking</b> of Al-Ahsa soils resulted in moderate <b>slaking</b> or complete <b>slaking</b> with HCl of the indurated layers.

The main cementing material is calcium carbonate with relatively higher proportion of amorphous alumina, silica and free iron oxides. Traceable amounts of Mn were detected in CBD extractions.

40|$|Although the <b>slaking</b> of lime is a {{reaction}} of great antiquity, {{there have been}} few fundamental studies of its kinetics and mechanism. In this paper, the kinetics of the reaction are reported for lime samples in two different arrangements: rotating discs and powders. In the former case, the rate was measured by solution analysis; in the latter, by calorimetry. The rate of <b>slaking</b> of a rotating lime disc was approximately constant with time but depended on the disc rotation speed. In the presence of Ca 2 + or OH− ions, the <b>slaking</b> rate was reduced. These results were accounted for by assuming that the slow step {{in the early stages of}} the <b>slaking</b> reaction was the diffusion of calcium hydroxide away from the reacting surface. Reasonable agreement between the measured <b>slaking</b> rates and those calculated on the assumption of slow calcium hydroxide diffusion was obtained. When powder samples were used, the rates of <b>slaking</b> could be fitted to the equation for a shrinking sphere model. It was shown that the effect of increasing the calcium oxide particle size or increasing either the time or temperature of preparation from calcium carbonate was to decrease the rate. Electron micrographs of the powdered lime before <b>slaking</b> were used to interpret these results. The effect of Ca 2 + or OH− ions on the <b>slaking</b> rate of powder lime samples closely paralleled those of the rotating disc sample suggesting the reaction mechanisms are similar...|$|R
40|$|The <b>slaking</b> {{characteristic}} of the clayey soil when soaked {{is a very important}} physical property of soil structure, and is also the fundamental property to make use of in the improvement of clayey soils. In this report, the behavior of clayey soil on reclamatcd land in the water area was studied in various drying stages and also on the repeated action of drying and wetting. Namely, the clayey soil (muddy soil) sampled from the sea bottom destined for reclamation was prepared by kneading and moulding with water content of about the liquid limit, and was preliminarily dried to a given pF of the soil moisture, and observations were made on their <b>slaking</b> properties when soaked in the 20 ℃ distilled water. The <b>slaking</b> percentages after leaving the soil for 24 houres on the 5 mm sieve in the water　were calculated And then, the <b>slaking</b> percentages after receiving repeated actions of drying and wetting or the effect of salt concentration in the sample were also tested under the same experimental conditions. The experimental results are as follows : 1. The <b>slaking</b> percentages of clayey soil of the sea bottom differs considerably depending on whether the drying stages is below or above pF 4 of the soil moisture. When below pF 4 of the soil moisture, the drying brings decrease in the amount of <b>slaking</b> soil. And when drying becomes over pF 4 of the soil moisture, rewetting brings in very loose soil structure and the great amount of <b>slaking</b> soil. 2. After receiving repeated actions of drying and wetting, the <b>slaking</b> behavior of the sample seemed to receive the influences of the soil bonding materials. The <b>slaking</b> percentages of the air dried sample which had 36 % in the first rewetting cycle increased to about 40 % when soaked after the 3 rd to 4 th repeated cycle. While the oven dried sample with only 0. 4 % <b>slaking</b> at first gets finally about 33 % <b>slaking</b> after receiving 6 th cycle of the repeated actions of drying and wetting. 3. Of the sample which receive the repeated actions of air drying and wetting, when the salt from the sample soil prevented to dissolve to the surrounded water in the rewetting stage, the <b>slaking</b> percentage in the second cycle became 25 %. This was a rather higher percentage than in the other cases...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAiming at {{alternative}} {{small hive beetle}} control, <b>slaked</b> lime, powdered limestone and {{diatomaceous earth}} (Fossil Shield® FS 95, FS 90. 0 and FS 90. 0 s) were evaluated for their effects on pupation and adult emergence in the laboratory. Limestone, FS 90. 0 and FS 95 showed no significant effect. <b>Slaked</b> lime in autoclaved soil prevented pupation, but was lethal only in high dosages of 10 and 15 g per 100 g soil. In non-autoclaved soil, low <b>slaked</b> lime dosages of 0. 5 and 5 g resulted each in > 90 % mortality, possibly due to enhanced pathogen activity.
