5|$|A National Park Service {{spokesperson}} {{reported that}} <b>surveys</b> <b>revealed</b> cracks {{near the top}} of the Washington Monument, the world's tallest stone structure, which remained closed for repairs until May 2014. The earthquake severely damaged three of the four pinnacles (corner spires) on the central tower of the Washington National Cathedral, cracked some of its flying buttresses, and caused additional damage. As the cathedral's insurance policy did not cover earthquake damage, cathedral officials stated that they would need to raise millions of dollars to fully evaluate the damage and to stabilize and repair its limestone exterior.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 {{the sails}} were {{replaced}} and the mill re-thatched and restored by local craftsmen {{at a cost}} of a £100,000; the mill was re-opened later that year. The work was funded by the Grantscape Community Heritage Fund. Although the sails do not rotate with the wind, they are moved 90 degrees four times per year for maintenance. Before the restoration work was undertaken <b>surveys</b> <b>revealed</b> that the mill was used as a roost for long-eared and lesser horseshoe bats. It was ensured that the bats would still have access after the restoration.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, imaging of {{the system}} with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for <b>Surveys</b> <b>revealed</b> the {{presence}} of a secondary dust disk inclined at an angle of about 5° to the main disk and extending at least 130 AU from the star. The secondary disk is asymmetrical: the southwest extension is more curved and less inclined than the northeast. The imaging was not good enough to distinguish between the main and secondary disks within 80 AU of Beta Pictoris, however the northeast extension of the dust disk is predicted to intersect with the main disk at about 30 AU from the star. The secondary disk may be produced by a massive planet in an inclined orbit removing matter from the primary disk and causing it to move in an orbit aligned with the planet.|$|E

5|$|With its {{location}} {{close to the}} storm's center, Dauphin Island saw the greatest damage in Alabama. Access to the island was shut down during and immediately after the hurricane, slowing the progression of damage assessments. Additionally, the storm cut power and phone services. Post-storm <b>surveys</b> <b>revealed</b> discernible patterns in structural damage on the island; these included a nearly complete lack of destruction on the heavily wooded eastern end, and damage concentrated closer to the western side and along areas exposed to strong easterly winds. First-hand accounts relayed that in the most severe cases, entire elevated homes were torn from their pilings and swept into the Gulf of Mexico. The number of homes demolished in that manner was informally placed at 50, though such total building collapses were typically confined to poorly secured buildings. In total, the hurricane destroyed 190 residences on Dauphin Island, accounting for nearly 25% of all homes, and a further 235 sustained substantial damage. An unofficial and early estimate of losses on the island was $30 million.|$|E
5|$|Stations in Paradip and Bhubaneswar each {{recorded}} sustained {{winds of}} 150km/h (90mph) before their instruments failed. Winds of 175km/h (110mph) were measured in Puri as the cyclone {{passed to the}} north. The strong winds damaged electric lines and uprooted trees over 50years old in Puri and Kendrapada. Downed power lines across the state cut off communications between Odisha {{and the rest of}} the world for over 24hours and caused widespread power outages. According to the Southern Electricity Supply Corporation, damage to the power grid caused by the cyclone totaled ₹330million (US$4.4million). Stalling over land, the Odisha cyclone dropped torrential rainfall, with 24-hour rainfall rates at times exceeding 20cm (7.9in); Paradip documented 53cm (20.9in) over one 24-hour period. Over the course of the storm's passage, total rainfall amounts over 60cm (23.6in) occurred over a large swath of Odisha. The highest recorded rainfall total was documented in Oupada, which measured 95.5cm (37.60in) of rain over a three-day period. Flooding caused by the storm was estimated to have killed approximately 2,000people. The heavy rains flattened thatched huts and damaged roads and other infrastructure. Within the seven worst affected districts, over 70%of homes were destroyed; most of these were thatched homes, though 10–15%of non-thatch roofed homes were also destroyed. Approximately 11,000schools were either significantly damaged or destroyed. All major district roads in the area were either washed out or blocked by felled trees. In Bhubaneswar, 60%of trees were flattened by the winds and rain; aerial <b>surveys</b> <b>revealed</b> that the entire city was submerged by floodwaters. Adjacent areas were nearly stripped of all tree cover. Until 8November, the city remained without power. The inundation induced by the far-reaching storm surge and heavy rain kept Konark submerged in knee-deep water for six days after landfall. Over the course of four days, the excessive rainfall caused the flooding of the Baitarani, Brahmani, Budhabalanga, Kharasua, and Salandi rivers, resulting in 20,005flood embankment breaches and the damaging of 6headworks. Thousands of people suffered chemical burns after the flooding mixed industrial chemicals into bathing ponds. Oswal Chemicals and Fertilisers, which maintained the world's largest diammonium phosphate plant, reported severe damage to the facility. In the five Odishan districts most affected, all electric water pumps were disabled, though hand pumps remained operable.|$|E

25|$|The <b>surveys</b> <b>revealed</b> that atheistic Satanists {{appeared}} to be in the majority, although the numbers of theistic Satanists {{appeared to}} grow over time. Beliefs in the afterlife varied, although the most popular afterlife views were reincarnation and the idea that consciousness survives bodily death. The surveys also demonstrated that most recorded Satanists practiced magic, although there were differing opinions as to whether magical acts operated according to etheric laws or whether the effect of magic was purely psychological. A number described performing cursing, in most cases as a form of vigilante justice.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Antarctic Division {{conducted}} {{an expedition to}} Heard Island during the austral summer of 2003-04. A small team of scientists spent two months on the island, conducting studies on avian and terrestrial biology and glaciology. Glaciologists conducted further research on the Brown Glacier, {{in an effort to}} determine whether glacial retreat is rapid or punctuated. Using a portable echo sounder, the team took measurements of the volume of the glacier. Monitoring of climatic conditions continued, with an emphasis on the impact of Foehn winds on glacier mass balance. Based on the findings of that expedition, the rate of loss of glacier ice on Heard Island appears to be accelerating. Between 2000 and 2003, repeat GPS surface <b>surveys</b> <b>revealed</b> that the rate of loss of ice in both the ablation zone and the accumulation zone of Brown Glacier was more than double average rate measured from 1947 to 2003. The increase in the rate of ice loss suggests that the glaciers of Heard Island are reacting to ongoing climate change, rather than approaching dynamic equilibrium. The retreat of Heard Island's glaciers is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.|$|E

[...] The tornado then crossed the Ohio River and moved across a rural peninsula of Vanderburgh County, Indiana. Few structures were impacted in this rural area, though a two-story house built in 1875 sustained major roof damage, and tree branches were embedded into {{the walls of the}} house. One farm equipment shed was demolished, and another sustained major damage. A 10,000-pound truck was flipped over, and heavy farm equipment was moved several feet. Aerial <b>surveys</b> <b>revealed</b> distinct spiral-shaped scour marks in farm fields in this area.
