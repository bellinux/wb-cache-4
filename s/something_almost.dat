Stevie learned to calculate fuel mileage, a hugely important function in the sport, and would monitor the race listening to radio communications between the crew chief and Waltrip.|$|E

The Stages Mark Wright called it [...] "a curious oddity" [...] and called comparisons to Curb [...] "inevitable". Ian Johns of The Times [...] "obsessed" [...] over the similarities to Curb, though singled out Crilly and Gardner for their performances, and described Dee's characterisation of Rick as [...] "turning childish pettiness into <b>something</b> <b>almost</b> endearing".|$|E
500|$|The {{wiring to}} the {{subscriber}} in telephone networks is generally done in twisted pair cable. [...] Its impedance at audio frequencies, and {{especially at the}} more restricted telephone band frequencies, is far from constant. [...] It is possible to manufacture this kind of cable to have a 600 Ω characteristic impedance but it will only be this value at one specific frequency. [...] This might be quoted as a nominal 600 Ω impedance at 800Hz or 1kHz. [...] Below this frequency the characteristic impedance rapidly rises and {{becomes more and more}} dominated by the ohmic resistance of the cable as the frequency falls. [...] At the bottom of the audio band the impedance can be several tens of kilohms. [...] On the other hand, at high frequency in the MHz region, the characteristic impedance flattens out to <b>something</b> <b>almost</b> constant. [...] The reason for this response is explained at primary line constants.|$|E

500|$|Edward James Olmos portrays Gaff. Olmos {{used his}} diverse ethnic background, and {{personal}} research, {{to help create}} the fictional [...] "Cityspeak" [...] language his character uses in the film. His initial address to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in Hungarian and means, [...] "Horse dick ! No way. You are the Blade ... Blade Runner." [...] M. Emmet Walsh plays Captain Bryant, a hard-drinking, sleazy, and underhanded police veteran typical of the film noir genre. Joe Turkel portrays Dr. Eldon Tyrell, a corporate mogul who built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid slaves. William Sanderson was cast as J. F. Sebastian, a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity. J.F. sympathizes with the replicants, whom he sees as companions, and shares their shorter lifespan due to his rapid aging disease; Joe Pantoliano was considered for the role. James Hong portrays Hannibal Chew, an elderly geneticist specializing in synthetic eyes, and Hy Pyke portrays the sleazy bar owner Taffey Lewis with ease and in a single take, <b>something</b> <b>almost</b> unheard-of with Scott whose drive for perfection resulted at times in double-digit takes.|$|E
500|$|Jay Park's {{music is}} {{generally}} contemporary R and hip hop, {{but he also}} incorporates pop, dance, soul, electronic and acoustic into his songs. Prior to debuting with 2PM, Park was coached vocally by former SOLID member and renowned R artist Kim Jo-han, also known to be the vocal coach of many idols in the industry. Kim {{went on to say}} that [...] " [...] has an appealing and unique voice" [...] and [...] "definitely stood out amongst the rest". Park began to write rap lyrics since eighth grade. Since becoming a solo artist, he has complete creative control over his music : he writes and composes his own songs, produces his albums, chooses the people he wants to work with, and participates in the mastering and mixing of his songs, <b>something</b> <b>almost</b> unheard-of for a singer in the Korean music industry. More than making hit songs, Park says he wants people to hear to his style of music, to make them listen to [...] "Jay Park-sounding" [...] music. Being fluent in both English and Korean, Park writes songs in these two languages. He admits that he is more at ease when writing songs in English than in Korean, as he started learning Korean in his late teens. Having grown up listening to music of American artists, he admits his music sounds more [...] "American" [...] than K-Pop, saying it is the style of music he wants to make, while still being recognized as K-Pop. His musical process starts by listening to a lot of beats sent by various producers, while thinking of what kind of song he wants to write, and eventually short-listing a selection of potential beats to work with. Then, Park works on the melody of the song, along with ideas and lyrics. He writes the hook of the song first, and finally the verses. Park is inspired by everything when writing songs : [...] "just listening to good songs, seeing a good live performance, having good conversations with people. Just everyday life". Some songs Park wrote are influenced by songs from other artists, for example, his song [...] "Turn Off Your Phone" [...] (Korean: Revised Romanization: Jeonhwagireur Kkeonwa) from his album New Breed was inspired by Leessang's hit single [...] "Turn Off the TV ..." [...] (Korean: Revised Romanization: TV Reurkkeotne) from their 7th album Asura Balbalta.|$|E
