5|$|The flower as a {{whole is}} usually {{radially}} <b>symmetrical</b> (actinomorphic), but may be bilaterally <b>symmetrical</b> (zygomorphic) in some species. Flower colors range from white through yellow and red to magenta.|$|E
5|$|Athetosis – Athetosis is {{generally}} characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements and a difficulty maintaining a <b>symmetrical</b> posture (e.g. cerebral palsy, choreoathetosis).|$|E
5|$|Crawling with an {{alternating}} gait, hawksbill tracks left in {{the sand}} are asymmetrical. In contrast, the green sea turtle and the leatherback turtle have a more <b>symmetrical</b> gait.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>symmetrical</b> character, {{the middle}} is drawn first, then the sides.|$|E
5|$|Little Mount Adams is a <b>symmetrical</b> {{cinder cone}} {{on top of}} the Ridge of Wonders on Adams' {{southeast}} flank.|$|E
5|$|Tal himself lost {{a famous}} game as White from a <b>symmetrical</b> {{position}} in Tal–Beliavsky, USSR Championship 1974.|$|E
5|$|The Buckleyi Group {{contains}} all cultivars {{with at least}} some features clearly showing inheritance from S. russelliana: stem segments with rounded, more <b>symmetrical</b> teeth; more or less <b>symmetrical</b> (regular) flowers which hang down, below the horizontal; and pollen which is pink. They generally flower later than members of the Truncata Group {{and are more likely}} to be called Christmas cactus.|$|E
5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. This is probably because the designs shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being <b>symmetrical,</b> they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{primitive}} snakes such as boas, pythons {{and certain}} advanced snakes such as vipers have small scales arranged irregularly {{on the head}}. Other more advanced snakes have special large <b>symmetrical</b> scales on the head called shields or plates.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} before the reforms {{introduced}} by Deng Xiaoping {{the old city}} of Lhasa was left largely intact, while bleakly functional compounds containing <b>symmetrical</b> dormitory-type buildings for both living and working were built apart from the city along the main roads.|$|E
5|$|In the illustration, the <b>symmetrical</b> cusped and {{scrolling}} seatrails {{that flow}} into stubby cabriole legs of these comfortable low armchairs (chauffeuses) have their direct origins in Chinese lacquer tables (not chairs).|$|E
5|$|Initial asymmetries {{have also}} been {{confirmed}} in TypeIa supernovae through observation. This result may mean that the initial luminosity {{of this type of}} supernova depends on the viewing angle. However, the expansion becomes more <b>symmetrical</b> with the passage of time. Early asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarization of the emitted light.|$|E
5|$|Palladio deeply {{considered}} the dual purpose of his villas as both farmhouses and palatial weekend retreats for wealthy merchant owners. These <b>symmetrical</b> temple-like houses often have equally <b>symmetrical,</b> but low, wings sweeping {{away from them}} to accommodate horses, farm animals, and agricultural stores. The wings, sometimes detached and connected to the villa by colonnades, were designed not only to be functional but also to complement and accentuate the villa. They were, however, in no way intended {{to be part of}} the main house, and it is in the design and use of these wings that Palladio's followers in the 18th century adapted to become an integral part of the building.|$|E
5|$|Stereotyped and {{repetitive}} motor {{behaviors are}} a core {{part of the}} diagnosis of AS and other ASDs. They include hand movements such as flapping or twisting, and complex whole-body movements. These are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than tics, which are usually faster, less rhythmical and less often <b>symmetrical.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Grade I mansion's {{principal}} facade {{has been}} substantially remodelled. The house {{is made of}} red brick with ashlar quoining and the principal facade, terminated by <b>symmetrical</b> matching bays, has tall paned windows. The house and detached tower are among the earliest uses of brick as the principal building material for an English house.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian bow is {{a fairly}} long, {{approximately}} <b>symmetrical,</b> composite reflex bow with bone stiffeners. Its shape is known from two graves in which {{the position of the}} bone plates could be reconstructed. Modern Hungarians have attempted to reconstruct the composite bows of their ancestors and have revived mounted archery as a competitive sport.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey {{house has}} a <b>symmetrical</b> facade with {{projecting}} wings {{either side of the}} central doorway with a Tuscan portico. The interior of the stone house is decorated with extensive plaster mouldings to ceilings and fireplaces. The grounds and gardens were laid out by Humphry Repton, but have since been reduced in size.|$|E
5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially <b>symmetrical,</b> is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds {{new light on the}} sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E
5|$|A worm whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} {{in a straight line}} forever. This is a trivial case, so it is usually stipulated that the worm must turn when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image <b>symmetrical</b> duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E
5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} react with N,N-disubstituted amides to give {{aldehydes}} and ketones, and <b>symmetrical</b> ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide. They thermally decompose {{to eliminate a}} β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases. In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCO2H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH). Finally, they {{may be used to}} synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.|$|E
5|$|As urban populations grew, major neo-Gothic {{churches were}} built to {{accommodate}} them. After {{the passing of}} the Catholic Relief Act, James Gillespie Graham designed St Andrew's Roman Catholic Chapel in Glasgow (1814–17). There was also growth in the Episcopal Church, which benefited from the mainly Anglican migrant English workers. In Edinburgh these were modelled on the English Perpendicular, as at St Paul's York Place (1816–18), the towered St John's Chapel (1816–18) and St David's (Ramshorn) (1824–26). In Glasgow, the Ramshorn Kirk's has a T-plan and <b>symmetrical</b> front with tall tower.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata at a decisive {{turning point in}} his career. Moving from posts {{in the service of}} churches and courts to the town of Leipzig on the first Sunday after Trinity, 30 May 1723, he began the project of composing a new cantata for every occasion of the liturgical year. He began his first annual cycle of cantatas ambitiously with , in an unusual layout of 14 movements in two <b>symmetrical</b> parts, to be performed before and after the sermon. , performed a week later, has the same structure.|$|E
5|$|Both Avram Iancu and Unrii Squares feature {{ensembles}} of eclectic and baroque–rococo architecture, {{including the}} Palace of Justice, the Theatre, the Iuliu Maniu <b>symmetrical</b> street, and the New York Palace, among others. In the 19th century many houses {{were built in}} the Neo-classical, Romantic and Eclectic styles. Also dating to that period are the two-towered Neo-classical Calvinist church (1829–50), its new college building of 1801, and the City Hall (1843–46) in the marketplace, by Antal Kagerbauer.|$|E
5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally <b>symmetrical</b> but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating {{to the other side of}} the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds are {{significant}} pollinators of cacti. Species showing the typical hummingbird-pollination syndrome have flowers with colors towards the red {{end of the}} spectrum, anthers and stamens that protrude from the flower, and a shape that is not radially <b>symmetrical,</b> with a lower lip that bends downwards; they produce large amounts of nectar with a relatively low sugar content. Schlumbergera species, such as S. truncata, have flowers that correspond closely to this syndrome. Other hummingbird-pollinated genera include Cleistocactus and Disocactus.|$|E
5|$|In 16th century England, Henry VIII began {{building}} Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses {{to counter the}} threat of invasion from France and Spain. They were built by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly <b>symmetrical,</b> with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the walls, and the fort was essentially a firing platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Young's {{interference}} experiment {{played a}} major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light. If white light is used in Young's experiment, the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits, surrounded by a <b>symmetrical</b> pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity. In addition to continuous electromagnetic radiation, Young's experiment has been performed with individual photons, with electrons, and with buckyball molecules large enough to be seen under an electron microscope.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, two Port Orford cedar {{trees were}} {{planted on the}} east side of City Hall. One tree was planted on the north side and the second tree on the south side of the {{building}} to reinforce the <b>symmetrical</b> aspects of the building. The south tree was replaced in 1999 due to poor health. In 1910, the city added passenger elevators to the open stairwells.|$|E
5|$|In biology, Holliday {{junctions}} {{are a key}} intermediate in {{many types}} of genetic recombination, {{as well as in}} double-strand break repair. These junctions usually have a <b>symmetrical</b> sequence and are thus mobile, meaning that the four individual arms may slide through the junction in a specific pattern that largely preserves base pairing. Additionally, four-arm junctions similar to Holliday junctions appear in some functional RNA molecules.|$|E
5|$|In early 2011, Qualcomm {{announced}} a new processor architecture called Krait, which used the ARM v7 instruction set, but was based on Qualcomm's own processor design. The processors were called S4 and had a feature named Asynchronous <b>Symmetrical</b> Multi-Processing (aSMP), meaning each processor core adjusted its clock speed and voltage based on the device's activity in order to optimize battery usage. Prior models were renamed to S1, S2 and S3 to distinguish each generation.|$|E
5|$|In {{junctions}} with <b>symmetrical</b> sequences, the branchpoint is {{mobile and}} can migrate {{in a random}} walk process. The rate of branch migration varies dramatically with ion concentration, with single-step times increasing from 0.3−0.4 ms with no ions to 270−300 ms with 10 mM Mg2+. The change in rate is correlated {{with the formation of}} the stacked versus the unstacked structures.|$|E
5|$|Irish or English Irish – In England, the Irish is {{standardized}} by the NFRS as an {{equilateral triangle}} of white {{with a side}} that begins at the chest, or between the front legs, and where the point ends mid length. In the United States and elsewhere, clubs like the AFRMA distinguish this marking as the English Irish and allow for another standardized Irish in which the rat may have white of an even or <b>symmetrical</b> nature anywhere along its underside.|$|E
5|$|Its {{dimensions}} are highly <b>symmetrical</b> and proportionate, probably {{influenced by the}} geometric ideals, ratios and rules of design of the ancient Greeks. The balance of measurements, especially between the width and height of the cross, seem derived from the sides and diagonals of squares, and dynamic rectangles. Cimabue was not rigid in his placement, however, and to accommodate the sway of Christ's body, altered the positioning {{of some of the}} boards on the lower half.|$|E
5|$|Like many Elizabethan mansions, Barrington {{is built}} in an 'E' shape with large {{projecting}} wings with square projections that contain staircases. The {{house is not}} truly <b>symmetrical</b> as the hall has two lights and the buttery one. The south front has seven gables supported by octagonal buttresses and decorated with twisted finials with ogee scale-work caps and English Crockets.|$|E
5|$|Literary Hall is {{a two-story}} red brick structure, {{rectangular}} in plan, {{and topped with}} a gable roof. The first floor of Literary Hall consists of four rooms, and the second story is a single large ballroom. Fused with <b>symmetrical</b> elements evoking Federal and Greek Revival architectural styles are exterior decorative moldings and brick corbeling in the Victorian style.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{also argue}} that Black has certain countervailing advantages. The {{consensus}} that White should try to win can be a psychological burden for the white player, who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win. Some <b>symmetrical</b> openings (i.e. those where both players make the same moves) can lead to situations where moving first is a disadvantage, either for psychological or objective reasons.|$|E
