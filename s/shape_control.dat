The exact elimination of the residual vibration via input shaping technique depends on the amplitudes and instants of impulse application.

In this paper, a closed-loop input <b>shaping</b> <b>control</b> scheme is developed for uncertain flexible structures. The algorithm is based on input <b>shaping</b> <b>control</b> and adaptive sliding mode control. The proposed scheme does not need a priori knowledge of upper bounds on the norm of the uncertainties, but estimates them by using the adaptation technique. This scheme guarantees closed-loop system stability, and yields good performance and robustness in the presence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances as well. Furthermore, it is shown that increasing the robustness to parameter uncertainties does not lengthen the duration of the impulse sequence.

40|$|Input <b>shaping</b> <b>control</b> {{techniques}} {{have proven to}} be very effective in improving performance and lowering actuation re-quirements for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. However, deployments tend to be very sensitive to variation of the system natural frequencies and damping ratios. This limits the appli-cation of input shaping schemes in the nonlinear systems (e. g., robotic manipulators) or systems with uncertain parameters. The main focus {{of this paper is to}} address the parametric uncertainty in the system and the design of an input <b>shaping</b> <b>control</b> based upon the estimated parameters. The variations induced by sys-tem non-linearity are tackled by the method of the linearization. The uncertainty is characterized by treating the linearized system mass matrix as a random matrix. This provides the probability density function of the eigenvalues of the underdamped system that are then used to design the input <b>shaping</b> <b>control</b> for the uncertain system. We believe that such a characterization (and desensitization to production variability) is especially important for successful deployment of newer generations of 3 D printed robotic systems. This is verified via a Monte Carlo simulation — the statistics of the percent residual vibration verifies the superi-ority of the input <b>shaping</b> <b>control</b> scheme based on the estimated parameter values (compared to the one based on the nominal parameters). ∗Address all correspondence to this author...|$|R

50|$|The loss of vinculin impacts {{a variety}} of cell functions; it {{disrupts}} {{the formation of the}} complex, and prevents cell adhesion and spreading. The absence of the protein demonstrates a decrease in spreading of cells, accompanied by reduced stress fiber formation, formation of fewer focal adhesions, and inhibition of lamellipodia extension. It was discovered that cells that are deficient in vinculin have growth cones that advance more slowly, as well as filopodia and lamellipoida that were less stable than the wild-type. Based on research, it has been postulated that the lack of vinculin may decrease cell adhesion by inhibiting focal adhesion assembly and preventing actin polymerization. On the other hand, overexpression of vinculin may restore adhesion and spreading by promoting recruitment of cytoskeletal proteins to the focal adhesion complex at the site of integrin binding. Vinculin's ability to interact with integrins to the cytoskeleton at the focal adhesion appears to be critical for control of cytoskeletal mechanics, cell spreading, and lamellipodia formation. Thus, vinculin appears to {{play a key role in}} <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> based on its ability to modulate focal adhesion structure and function.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Ligand exchange=== As-synthesized UCNPs {{are usually}} capped with organic ligands that aid {{in size and}} <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> during preparation. These ligands make their surface {{hydrophobic}} and hence are not dispersible in aqueous solution, preventing their biological applications. One simple method to increase solubility in aqueous solvents is direct ligand exchange. This requires a more favored ligand to replace the initial ones. The hydrophobic native ligand capping the NP during synthesis (usually a long chain molecule like oleic acid) is directly substituted with a more polar hydrophilic one, which are usually multi chelating (e.g. poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG)-phosphate, poly(acrylic acid)) and hence provides better stabilisation/ binding resulting in their exchange. A shortcoming of this method is the slow kinetics associated with the exchange. Generally the new ligand is also functionalized with a group like thiol that allows for facile binding to the NP surface. The protocol for direct exchange is simple, generally involving mixing {{for an extended period}} of time, but the work-up can be tedious, conditions must be optimized for each system, and aggregation may occur However the two-step process of ligand exchange involves the removal of original ligands followed by coating hydrophilic ones, which is a better method. The ligand removal step here was reported through various ways. A simple way was wash the particles with ethanol under ultrasonic treatment. Reagents like NOBF4 or acids are used to strip the native ligands off of the NP surface to attach favorable ones later on. This method shows less tendency for NP aggregation than the direct exchange, and can be generalized to other types of nanoparticles.|$|E

5000|$|The {{recognition}} of Levallois {{as a distinct}} core reduction strategy dates to the late 19th Century. The term was used to describe specific flakes with certain surface attributes that were recovered during that period in northern France. These early descriptions were purely typological {{and based on the}} morphology of the flake products themselves. However, there was never a great deal of consensus among scholars, which typological attributes could be used to identify Levallois products. Gradually, more and more emphasis was put on the idea that Levallois flakes were the products of a particular method or process of production. Indeed, F. Bordes emphasised that Levallois was essentially a method and not a particular product. However, the shape and character of a Levallois blank is also thought to be [...] "predetermined" [...] by the elaborate Levallois core preparation process [...] While a <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> system undoubtedly exists for the Levallois cores, there remain a number of significant problems. Indeed, how applied force will propagate through a specific core is determined by a number of variables and not only by the will or the desire of the Middle Palaeolithic flintknapper. Fracture mechanic variables include size, shape and internal structure of a particular flint nodule, but also the mass and resilience of the hammer stone and finally the angle and force of the blow and the shape of the core's striking platform. Given the imprecision of hand-eye co-ordination , a rather high probability for only partial core reduction success is very real. Not only are there a number of significant problems with defining Levallois on the basis of predetermined blanks, but there is also considerable disagreement over what set of attributes should be used to characterise a Levallois product. Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that very different core reduction strategies can produce seemingly diagnostic Levallois blanks.|$|E
