Though there are aluminium alloys with somewhat-higher tensile strengths than the commonly used kinds of steel, simply replacing a <b>steel</b> <b>part</b> with an aluminium alloy might lead to problems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The {{main idea}} of this paper {{consists}} in creation of the optimal depth of shell which provides optimal stress distribution in quenched <b>steel</b> <b>parts.</b> For small <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> optimal quenched layer can be provided by using of low and limited hardenability steels (LH). For big <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> optimal quenched layer can be provided by use of low alloy steels. Since the LH steel core does not harden significantly, the ductility of the core is also maintained. The same is true when using low alloy steels for manufacturing big <b>steel</b> <b>parts.</b> The grain sizes of LH steels are above ASTM 8. It is shown that {{the high level of}} compressive surface residual stresses and steel superstrengthening phenomenon can eliminate the need for secondary shot peening or surface induction operations. Also carburized alloy steels can be successfully replaced by LH steels to increase service life and decrease cost of materials.

Carbon steels are not very hardenable meaning they can not be hardened throughout thick sections. Alloy steels have a better hardenability, so they can through-hardened and do not require case hardening. This property of carbon steel can be beneficial, because it gives the surface good wear characteristics but leaves the core tough.|$|E

50|$|The dam {{operated}} {{for several}} decades, until the mines closed. After that time, the dam {{was no longer}} maintained. On Easter morning of 1941, the spillway behind the dam broke, causing a flood. There was little damage to the <b>steel</b> <b>part</b> of the dam, but with the mining operations stopped, the dam owners had the spillway valves opened. However, there were still incidents of overtopping, and the Copper Range Company (successor to Atlantic Mine Company {{and owner of the}} dam) had large holes cut in it in 1979 so that it would not retain water. This lowered the level of the reservoir, revealing the earlier timber dam.|$|E
50|$|Metal hydroxides/oxides do {{not provide}} a solid surface for the paint to adhere to, and paint will come off in large flakes. Using a primer will provide extra {{insurance}} against such a scenario. An additional reason for using a primer on metal could be the poor condition of the surface. A <b>steel</b> <b>part</b> can be rusty, for example. Of course, the best solution is to thoroughly clean the metal (blasting), but when {{this is not a}} viable option, special kinds of primers can be used that chemically convert rust to the solid metal salts. And even though such surface is still lacking in comparison to the shiny clean metal, it is yet much better than weak, porous rust.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHot-stamped high {{strength}} <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> {{are widely used}} to achieve lightweight of automobile. However, mechanical properties of formed {{high strength}} <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> are difficult to control and predict. In order to realize field nondestructive testing of hot forming high strength <b>steel</b> <b>parts,</b> magnetic Barkhausen noise which is sensitive to microstructure of ferromagnet was used. In the paper, magnetic Barkhausen noise signals of hot-stamped high strength steel strips with different hardness were measured and analyzed. A substantial correlation was found between magnetic Barkhausen noise and hardness (in range 220 ∼ 450 HV). Then, frequency domain analysis based on autoregressive modeling was done to find out signal components which are dependent and independent to hardness of the hot-stamped high strength steel. Independent signals can be eliminated based on the frequency analysis. Accordingly, the measurement accuracy can be improved for application in industrial field...|$|R

50|$|However, these testing {{standards}} neither provide information of testing periods for the coatings to be evaluated, nor {{the appearance of}} corrosion products in form of salts. Requirements are agreed between customer and manufacturer. In the automotive industry requirements are specified under material specifications. Different coatings have different behavior in salt spray test and consequently, test duration will differ from one type of coating to another. For example, a typical electroplated zinc and yellow passivated <b>steel</b> <b>part</b> lasts 96 hours in salt spray test without white rust. Electroplated zinc-nickel steel parts can last more than 720 hours in NSS test without red rust (or 48 hours in CASS test without red rust) Requirements are established in test duration (hours) and coatings shall comply with minimum testing periods.|$|E
50|$|Ceramics {{can be used}} {{in place}} of steel for ball bearings. Their higher {{hardness}} means they are much less susceptible to wear and typically last for triple the lifetime of a <b>steel</b> <b>part.</b> They also deform less under load, meaning they have less contact with the bearing retainer walls and can roll faster. In very high speed applications, heat from friction during rolling can cause problems for metal bearings, which are reduced by the use of ceramics. Ceramics are also more chemically resistant and {{can be used in}} wet environments where steel bearings would rust. In some cases, their electricity-insulating properties may also be valuable in bearings. Two drawbacks to ceramic bearings are a significantly higher cost and susceptibility to damage under shock loads.|$|E

50|$|Aside from {{short-lived}} wooden bridges {{before the}} 19th century, which were often {{damaged or destroyed}} by floods and frost, the first bridge in Bratislava was a pontoon bridge, which was built in 1825, standing somewhere around Koronázási domb tér or Krönungshügel platz (today's Ľudovít Štúr square). It lasted until 1891, when a new steel bridge called Franz Josephs Brücke (Franz Joseph Bridge), was opened, {{which was part of}} the railroad track Bratislava-Szombathely. It was built by Gábor Baross' order. During the first Czechoslovak republic (1918 - 1938) it was called Štefánikov most (Štefánik Bridge). During World War II the <b>steel</b> <b>part</b> of the bridge was destroyed, but the stone pillars survived. After the liberation of Bratislava by Soviet troops in 1945, the Red Army and German prisoners-of-war rebuilt the bridge.|$|E
50|$|A sub-surface {{compressive}} {{residual stress}} profile is measured using {{techniques such as}} x-ray diffraction and hardness profile testing. The X-axis is depth in mm or inches and the Y-axis is residual stress in ksi or MPa. The maximum residual stress profile can {{be affected by the}} factors of shot peening, including: part geometry, part material, shot material, shot quality, shot intensity, and shot coverage. For example, shot peening a hardened <b>steel</b> <b>part</b> with a process and then using the same process for another unhardened part could result in overpeening; causing a sharp decrease in surface residual stresses, but not affecting sub-surface stresses. This is critical because maximum stresses are typically at the surface of the material. Mitigation of these lower surface stresses can be accomplished by a multi-stage post process with varied shot diameters and other surface treatments that remove the low residual stress layer.|$|E
