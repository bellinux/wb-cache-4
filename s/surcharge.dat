5|$|January 2016 - Five year {{extension}} to the General Excise Tax <b>surcharge</b> adopted to add $1.2billion in funding.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the <b>surcharge</b> {{increase}}s, the toll in 2012 will be $2.25, or 16 cents per mile. The toll increase proposal drew 221 public comments and opponents outnumbered supporters by about 3 to 1. However, as the cost estimate grew from $5.25 billion to $6.8 billion, no final decisions have been reached to address the projected shortfall.|$|E
5|$|For {{a second}} DUI {{conviction}} in a 10-year period, irrespective of BAC, {{there is a}} fine of $500–$1,000, 2–90 days imprisonment, a 2-year license suspension, an automobile insurance <b>surcharge</b> of $1,000 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration. A person who has 3 or more DUI convictions and a gap of less than 10 years since the last conviction incurs a fine of $1,000, 6 months imprisonment, a 10-year license suspension, an automobile insurance <b>surcharge</b> of $1,500 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration. Jail sentences issued in New Jersey for DUI are often served through work release programs (e.g. weekends in jail).|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{depository}} institutions' decisions {{whether or}} not to impose <b>surcharges</b> (direct usage fees) on nondepositors who use their ATMs. In addition to documenting patterns of <b>surcharging,</b> we examine motives for <b>surcharging,</b> including both direct generation of fee revenue and the potential to attract deposit customers who wish to avoid incurring <b>surcharges</b> at an institution's ATMs. Consistent with expectations, we find that the probability of <b>surcharging</b> increases with both the institution's share of market ATMs and the time since <b>surcharging</b> was first allowed in the state, and decreases with increasing local ATM density. Further, we find evidence consistent with the use of <b>surcharges</b> to attract deposit customers who are new to the local banking market, but we find no evidence that larger banks use <b>surcharges</b> as a means to attract existing customers away from smaller local competitors. © 2003 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R
5|$|On March6, 2012, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} {{announced that it}} was going forward with an all-electronic tolling plan. Such a plan will take at least five years to implement to allow time for equipment to be installed and the reconfiguration of ramps. It will save the turnpike commission $65 million a year on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. The plans call for a 76% <b>surcharge</b> for motorists who do not have E-ZPass that are billed by mail. This <b>surcharge</b> could raise the toll for someone without E-ZPass to $53.10 to travel the entire turnpike. In October 2016, the turnpike began accepting credit cards as payment at all cash toll booths. In April 2018, the turnpike commission will implement all-electronic tolling at the Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas.|$|E
5|$|The turnpike {{commission}} {{announced plans}} to consider eliminating manned toll booths in favor of all-electronic tolls. With this system, tolls will be paid with E-ZPass or credit cards. Drivers unable to pay by either method will be billed by mail (using license plate recognition), and a <b>surcharge</b> will be imposed. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes license plate recognition. McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates have been hired to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic tolls. On March 6, 2012, the turnpike commission {{announced that it was}} implementing an all-electronic tolling plan. The turnpike commission will save $65million annually on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. Plans call for a 76-percent <b>surcharge</b> on motorists without E-ZPass who are billed by mail; this <b>surcharge</b> could raise the toll for a motorist without E-ZPass to well over $50 to travel the entire turnpike. On January 3, 2016, all-electronic tolling was introduced in the westbound direction at the Delaware River Bridge mainline toll plaza, while the eastern terminus of the ticket system was moved from the Delaware River Bridge to Neshaminy Falls.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} ATM <b>surcharges</b> on deployment and welfare, in a model where banks compete for ATM and banking services.

40|$|Since the {{imposition}} of <b>surcharges</b> {{for the use of}} automatic teller machines became widespread in 1996, the number of ATMs has increased significantly. That increase has benefited consumers greatly by making bank transactions more easily accessible. Critics of <b>surcharges</b> claim that banks are not passing cost savings generated by large ATM networks on to consumers. Such claims are false; operating ATMs is expensive and forces banks to use their own resources to meet consumer demand for ATMs. And <b>surcharges</b> are not anti-competitive; the banking industry remains competitive. <b>Surcharges</b> have created a new area of competition among banks as they try to meet consumer needs for fast and easy access to banks. Consumers who do not want to pay <b>surcharges</b> have plenty of options for accessing their bank accounts without paying a fee. A ban on ATM <b>surcharges,</b> as proposed by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N. Y.), would serve only to deny an important timesaving option to consumers who {{are willing to pay for}} the convenience of ATMs...|$|R

5|$|A slip ramp {{was also}} planned in 2000 {{to connect to}} Lafayette Street in Norristown {{as part of a}} {{revitalization}} plan for the community. The project would involve extending Lafayette Street to the new ramp. This proposed slip ramp is projected to cost $160 million. Montgomery County officials have proposed a <b>surcharge</b> for the new exit in {{to help pay for the}} project. Work on engineering and environmental approval for the interchange occurred in 2008, and acquisition of land began in 2011. On January 7, 2015, the turnpike commission committed $45 million to building this interchange. Construction on the interchange at Lafayette Street may begin as soon as 2018.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 NSB Gardermoen {{stated that}} they {{expected}} to charge commuter and intercity trains 100 million Norwegian krone per year {{to use the new}} line. County politicians in Akershus stated that it was not reasonable for commuters to {{have to pay for the}} new railway. Early estimates showed that this would almost double to price from Oslo to Eidsvoll, and that passengers would have different prices, depending on which route they followed. Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk, which was responsible for buses in Akershus, {{stated that they}} had no way to influence NSB's prices, but that they would consider starting a coach service along the route, which would not charge the <b>surcharge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rieber has {{suggested}} a {{package for the}} politicians, where he would create a company that would borrow money to build both the Ulriken Tunnel, a shortening of the line from Hønefoss to Sandvika (the Ringerike Line) and electrify the railway. Since NSB based their fares on the route length traveled, financing would be covered by a <b>surcharge</b> equal to the distance saved; ticket price would remain the same and within twenty years the debt would be covered. The government opposed the suggestion—Trygve Bratteli commenting {{that even though the}} financing was private, it would still have to use the same funding as government debt, and would jeopardize other projects, like the Nordland Line.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{a unique}} {{database}} {{to test the}} effect of ATM <b>surcharges</b> on larger versus smaller banks. Only nonbank ("foreign") users of ATMs pay ATM <b>surcharges.</b> Customers thus face incentives to switch accounts from smaller banks to larger banks {{in order to avoid}} high ATM <b>surcharges.</b> We find that, after we control for other bank factors, higher ATM <b>surcharges</b> result in a greater market share of deposits of larger banks and a lower market share for smaller banks, results that are consistent with customer switching. However, smaller banks can positively affect their market share by establishing larger ATM networks. ...|$|R
5|$|Seven of {{the lines}} are {{operated}} by the Norwegian State Railways, owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, while the Gjøvik Line is operated by the NSB-owned NSB Gjøvikbanen. The operating deficit is covered by the state for NSB's lines, while NSB Gjøvikbanen's routes are financed by a public service obligation. The trains have two sections, manned and unmanned. Validated ticket-holders can travel in the unmanned section, which have orange doors. Manned sections, with gray doors, have a conductor and allow passengers to purchase tickets. Tickets are available at ticket machines at stations; if bought inboard, there is a 20 Norwegian krone (NOK) <b>surcharge.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Drip pricing of {{unavoidable}} {{additional charges}} on air fares is outlawed in the European Economic Area. Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 requires that [...] "The final {{price to be}} paid shall at all times be indicated and shall include the applicable air fare or air rate as well as all applicable taxes, and charges, <b>surcharges</b> and fees which are unavoidable and foreseeable at the time of publication". In the early 2010s, many budget airlines sought to circumvent this requirement by adding <b>surcharges</b> for the most common means of payment. For example, Ryanair <b>surcharged</b> £6 per passenger per flight segment to process a single debit card payment whose cost was only a few pence. Article 19 of Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights has limited such payment <b>surcharges</b> to [...] "the cost borne by the trader" [...] since 13 June 2014, but because of the prevalence of these <b>surcharges,</b> the United Kingdom enacted the legislation earlier than required with effect from 6 April 2013 under the Consumer Rights (Payment <b>Surcharges)</b> Regulations 2012.|$|R

5|$|Although the {{original}} financing {{plan called for}} a 50-cent toll increase on the Dulles Toll Road to finance the Silver Line (25 cents at the main plaza and 25 cents at the ramp plazas), the increase in projected costs resulted in the MWAA Board approving {{an increase in the}} surcharges. Effective January 1, 2010, the fare <b>surcharge</b> was increased to 50 cents at both the main plaza and ramp plazas, with additional 25-cent increases in main-plaza tolls set for 2011 and 2012. These toll surcharges are designed to support MWAA's 52.6% share of the projected $5.25 billion combined cost of Phase I and Phase II. MWAA has justified these toll increases as necessary to meet an estimated $220 million in annual debt-service costs projected by 2020. These toll revenue requirements were {{based on the assumption that}} the federal government, although it contributed $900 million to Phase I, would not contribute funds for Phase II.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 the Bergen businessperson Fritz Rieber {{launched}} {{an idea for}} the shortening of Bergensbanen; the Ulriken Tunnel through the Bergen mountains, electrification from Voss to Bergen, {{and the construction of}} the Ringerike Line. Private financing would be provided through a dedicated limited company taking a <b>surcharge</b> on tickets, equal to the reduction in fare induced by the shorter line; within twenty years the debt would be covered. Passed by parliament in 1955, a year later they had changed their minds and only the investments around Bergen were supported; removing the support for Ringerike. Prime Minister Trygve Bratteli commented that private debt financing would have to compete with the debt taken up by the government on other railway projects, since politicians had to see the national economy as a whole, and that private financing would not allow more lines to be built. The cost was estimated at NOK 100 million.|$|E

Study 2 replicates this effect with partitioned versus consolidated prices. Study 3 reveals that consumers take longer to make purchasing decisions when buying from low-reputation sellers and that response times mediate the moderating role of reputation. Furthermore, the effect of <b>surcharges</b> levied by low-reputation sellers is attenuated for consumers with low (vs. high) need for cognition (study 4).
