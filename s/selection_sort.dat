For <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> these are the k smallest elements, while in insertion sort they are whatever the first k elements were in the unsorted array.

25|$|Two of the {{simplest}} sorts are insertion sort and <b>selection</b> <b>sort,</b> {{both of which are}} efficient on small data, due to low overhead, but not efficient on large data. Insertion sort is generally faster than <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> in practice, due to fewer comparisons and good performance on almost-sorted data, and thus is preferred in practice, but <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> uses fewer writes, and thus is used when write performance is a limiting factor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selection</b> <b>sort</b> is an in-place {{comparison}} sort.

40|$|We provide {{complete}} average-case {{as well as}} probabilistic {{analysis of}} the cost of bucket <b>selection</b> and <b>sorting</b> algorithms. Two variations of bucketing (and flavors there in) are considered: distributive bucketing (large number of buckets) and radix bucketing (recursive with a small number of buckets, suitable for digital computation). For Distributive Selection a compound Poisson limit is established. For all other flavors of bucket <b>selection</b> and <b>sorting,</b> central limit theorems underlying the cost are derived by asymptotic techniques involving perturbation of Rice's integral and contour integration (saddle point methods). In the case of radix bucketing, periodic luctuations appear in the moments of both the <b>selection</b> and <b>sorting</b> algorithms...|$|R
25|$|Bubble sort also interacts poorly {{with modern}} CPU hardware. It {{produces}} {{at least twice}} as many writes as insertion sort, twice as many cache misses, and asymptotically more branch mispredictions. Experiments by Astrachan sorting strings in Java show bubble sort to be roughly one-fifth as fast as an insertion sort and 70% as fast as a <b>selection</b> <b>sort.</b>|$|E
25|$|Heapsort is a {{much more}} {{efficient}} version of <b>selection</b> <b>sort.</b> It also works by determining the largest (or smallest) element of the list, placing that at the end (or beginning) of the list, then continuing {{with the rest of the}} list, but accomplishes this task efficiently by using a data structure called a heap, a special type of binary tree. Once the data list has been made into a heap, the root node is guaranteed to be the largest (or smallest) element. When it is removed and placed at the end of the list, the heap is rearranged so the largest element remaining moves to the root. Using the heap, finding the next largest element takes O(log n) time, instead of O(n) for a linear scan as in simple <b>selection</b> <b>sort.</b> This allows Heapsort to run in O(n log n) time, and this is also the worst case complexity.|$|E
500|$|A {{priority}} queue is a data structure for maintaining {{a collection of}} items with numerical priorities, having operations for finding and removing the item with the minimum priority value. Comparison-based {{priority queue}}s such as the binary heap take logarithmic time per update, but other structures such as the van Emde Boas tree or bucket queue may be faster for inputs whose priorities are small integers. These data structures {{can be used in}} the <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> algorithm, which sorts a collection of elements by repeatedly finding and removing the smallest element from the collection, and returning the elements in the order they were found. A priority queue can be used to maintain the collection of elements in this algorithm, and the time for this algorithm on a collection of [...] elements can be bounded by the time to initialize the priority queue and then to perform [...] find and remove operations. For instance, using a binary heap as a priority queue in <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> leads to the heap sort algorithm, a comparison sorting algorithm that takes [...] time. Instead, using <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> with a bucket queue gives a form of pigeonhole sort, and using van Emde Boas trees or other integer priority queues leads to other fast integer sorting algorithms.|$|E

2500|$|While {{insertion}} sort typically makes fewer comparisons than <b>selection</b> <b>sort,</b> it requires more writes because the inner loop can require shifting {{large sections of}} the sorted portion of the array. In general, {{insertion sort}} will write to the array O(n2) times, whereas <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> will write only O (...) times.

2500|$|Assuming the k+1st element's rank is random, {{insertion}} sort will on average require shifting {{half of the}} previous k elements, while <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> always requires scanning all unplaced elements.

50|$|A median-selection {{algorithm}} {{can be used}} {{to yield}} a general <b>selection</b> algorithm or <b>sorting</b> algorithm, by applying it as the pivot strategy in Quickselect or Quicksort; if the median-selection algorithm is asymptotically optimal (linear-time), the resulting <b>selection</b> or <b>sorting</b> algorithm is as well. In fact, an exact median is not necessary - an approximate median is sufficient. In the median of medians selection algorithm, the pivot strategy computes an approximate median and uses this as pivot, recursing on a smaller set to compute this pivot. In practice the overhead of pivot computation is significant, so these algorithms are generally not used, but this technique is of theoretical interest in relating <b>selection</b> and <b>sorting</b> algorithms.|$|R

50|$|Tournament {{replacement}} <b>selection</b> <b>sorts</b> {{are used}} to gather the initial runs for external sorting algorithms. Conceptually, an external file is read and its elements are pushed into the priority queue until the queue is full. Then the minimum element is pulled from the queue and written {{as part of the}} first run. The next input element is read and pushed into the queue, and the min is selected again and added to the run. There's a small trick that if the new element being pushed into the queue is less than the last element added to the run, then the element's sort value is increased so it {{will be part of the}} next run. On average, a run will be 100% longer than the capacity of the priority queue.|$|R

40|$|We apply a semi-parametric latent {{variable}} model to estimate <b>selection</b> and <b>sorting</b> {{effects on the}} evolution of private returns to schooling for college graduates during China’s reform between 1988 and 2002. We find that there were substantial sorting gains under the traditional system, but they have decreased drastically and are negligible in the most recent data. We take this as evidence of growing influence of private financial constraints on decisions to attend college as tuition costs have risen and the relative importance of government subsidies has declined. The main policy implication of our results is that labor and education reform without concomitant capital market reform and government support for the financially disadvantaged exacerbates increases in inequality inherent in elimination of the traditional "wage-grid.

40|$|RNA viruses, retroviruses and pararetroviruses, {{are known}} for their rapid evolution, because of high {{mutation}} rates and short generation times. Replication errors (mutations and imperfect recombinations) generate a great variability. However, selection pressures shape viral populations diversity, by acting at different steps of virus infectious cycle : strategies of genome expression, interactions with host(s) and vector(s) are the targets of selection. Such a <b>selection</b> <b>sorts</b> out genotypes according to their fitness. The second most important parameter acting on viral population diversity, genetic drift, occurs when population effective size is low, which seems to be frequent during host or tissue infection initiation. By contrast to selection, drift is a random, fitness‐independent process, which may lead to the fixation of deleterious mutations. Despite their exceptionally high mutation rates, RNA viruses seem to follow classical population genetics principles, as showed during the last two decades. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Sorting {{algorithms}} are {{an intrinsic}} part of functional programming folklore as they exemplify algorithm design using folds and unfolds. This {{has given rise}} to an informal notion of duality among sorting algorithms: insertion sorts are dual to <b>selection</b> <b>sorts.</b> Using bialgebras and distributive laws, we formalise this notion within a categorical setting. We use types as a guiding force in exposing the recursive structure of bubble, insertion, selection, quick, tree, and heap sorts. Moreover, we show how to distill the computational essence of these algorithms down to one-step operations that are expressed as natural transformations. From this vantage point, the duality is clear, and one side of the algorithmic coin will neatly lead us to the other `for free'. As an optimisation, the approach is also extended to paramorphisms and apomorphisms, which allow for more efficient implementations of these algorithms than the corresponding folds and unfolds...|$|R
40|$|Ecuador {{experienced}} an unprecedented wave of international migration {{since the late}} 1990 s, triggered by a severe economic and financial crisis. This paper gathers individual-level data from Ecuador and the two main destinations of Ecuadorian migrants: the US and Spain. First, we provide a careful description of the main characteristics of migration flows, {{both in terms of}} their scale and skill composition. Second, we estimate Mincer regressions for Ecuadorians in the three countries, and attempt to reconcile the features of migration flows with our predictions for earnings by destination. We find that earnings differences can account for the higher share of college graduates among migrants to the US, but fail to explain the larger scale of the flows to Spain. We argue that the puzzle is explained by taking into account that (i) the options to migrate legally to either destination were slim, and (ii) the cost of illegally migrating to Spain was lower than to the US.
