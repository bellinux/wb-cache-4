5|$|At the September 2008 {{topping off}} ceremony, Donald Trump marketed his hotel by expressing {{doubts about the}} Chicago Spire ever being {{completed}} due to the financial crisis of 2007–2009. However, Donald Jr. <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> fortunate to complete the project, while the Spire and Waterview Tower were among developments hit by the economic slowdown that followed the financial crisis.

5|$|Co-writer Glen Morgan felt {{doing an}} episode on vampires was a mistake, and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> also criticized for having Mulder fall for Kristen. Co-writer James Wong was also disappointed, {{saying that the}} script was {{a lot better than}} the show and that the episode was {{weakened}} when Fox censors had problems with the episode. Actor David Duchovny thought the episode had style, but suffered some lapses in logic, including the scene where Kristen shaves Mulder before the two kiss.|$|E

The French police agreed with Cox, {{due to the lack}} of ransom demands or signs of fraud. Whether dead or alive, there were still no clues as to the whereabouts of the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury.|$|E
5|$|Kelbajar {{is located}} between Armenia {{and the western}} {{boundary}} of former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. Situated between a steep mountain range, its wartime population of approximately 45,000–60,000 was primarily made up of ethnic Azeris and Kurds. Throughout the war, the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh had been voicing their discontent over seventy years of Azeri rule and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> defending themselves from Azerbaijan's aggression. Their capture of the towns of Khojaly and Shusha stemmed from security concerns in silencing artillery bombardments positioned in those towns. They stated that Karabakh had historically been an Armenian region and that their claims for territory did not extend beyond its boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} idea of making a game based around trials, which they found to be innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Thomas Bowskill at Nintendo Life said that the game had changed his idea of what can make for a great game, and called it a masterpiece. Carrie Gouskos at GameSpot said that the game revitalized the {{adventure}} game genre. Michael Cole at Nintendo World Report said that the game's design and interface would make it a good choice for non-gamers as well. Bowskill called the investigation sections tedious and boring at times, but <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> outweighed by the feeling of accomplishment from solving the cases. Craig Harris at IGN felt that the main issues with the game were its linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because of how the player can stop a witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt that the game was very linear, and that it was unclear how to proceed at certain points. He said that, because of how story-driven it is, the game has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.|$|E

5|$|For his part, Minh resented that he {{had been}} deposed by a younger officer whom he viewed as an unscrupulous upstart. Minh was also upset with the {{detention}} of his fellow generals and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter group was set free when Minh made this a condition for his serving as the figurehead chief of state. Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged neutralist plot {{for as long as he}} could, and then tried to revive it by claiming that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and to enforce neutralism. Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not aware of any such threat.|$|E
5|$|In Kansas City, Kansas, two {{religious}} missionaries visit {{two women}} at two different {{homes in the}} same neighborhood who look exactly alike. The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two FBI agents who look and sound remarkably similar to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton (Kathy Griffin). Betty claims to have never seen the other woman before. The other woman then passes her by in a car and the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after the gruesome mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> possessed. Meanwhile, the other woman, Lulu Pfeiffer (also Kathy Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get it because she has had 17 jobs in 17 states {{in the past three years}} and moves around too much. She becomes aggravated and suddenly, all the copies become black. The other woman, Betty, goes to another job with the same name and same resume.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner had a rocky {{relationship}} with the United States. Several items from a US air force plane, such as drugs and GPS devices, were seized by Argentine officials, which caused a diplomatic crisis. US State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> standard tools used in counter-terrorism tactics which were being taught to the Argentine police during the joint operation, and asked {{for the return of}} the seized materials. Kirchner blamed the whole country for the 2014 default, ruled by US judge Thomas P. Griesa. She said in a cadena nacional ("national network") address that the US may be trying to oust her from power, or even assassinate her. She said this a few days after accusing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant of similar assassination plans against her. The idea was rejected by opposition leader Elisa Carrió as a mere conspiracy theory.|$|E

5|$|Noé {{first tried}} to get the film funded in the early 2000s. Several {{producers}} responded positively to the script, and it was briefly under development for Tom Tykwer's German company X-Filme Creative Pool. It was considered too expensive and the producers dropped out. Prospects changed when Irréversible (2002) became a commercial success. Noé had written and directed Irréversible for StudioCanal, and it was sold internationally by their subsidiary, Wild Bunch. When the producers at Wild Bunch asked Noé {{what he wanted to do}} next, he answered Enter the Void. The project was once again considered too expensive in relation to its commercial potential, but when Wild Bunch discovered that Noé had started to develop the film for Pathé instead of them, they <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> willing to fund it. Since development went slowly at Pathé, Noé chose to not renew his contract with the studio and accepted Wild Bunch's offer.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1999, Kouao took Climbié {{to a local}} GP surgery. The {{practice}} nurse {{there did}} not carry out a physical examination as she was not reported to have any current health problems. By the middle of June 1999, Victoria was spending the majority of her days at the Brent home of Priscilla Cameron, an unregistered childminder, who Kouao met at {{her job at the}} hospital. There is no evidence that Climbié was treated badly during her time with Cameron. On several occasions, Cameron observed small cuts to Climbié's fingers. When questioned by Cameron, Kouao <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> caused by razor blades that Climbié played with. Kouao and Victoria met Ackah on the street on or around 14 June 1999. In what may have been early signs of deliberate physical harm, Ackah noted a scar on Climbié's cheek, which Kouao said was caused by a fall on an escalator. On 17 June 1999, in response to what she had seen three days earlier, Ackah visited Kouao and Climbié's home, and thought that the accommodation was unsuitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} rejected most of {{the negative}} criticism. The DfES said that the database would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. Laming had said that information for every child needs to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied any possibility of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that the database would be secure, that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies share information. Hughes said that the database would be secure and that 'we are confident we are doing all we could to ensure security'. The government <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> confident that the database complied with the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the number of children who slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E
