50|$|Using {{this new}} form of fondant artistry should be used on a heavy cake consistency. It can, however, be used on the {{traditional}} cake mix purchased in a store. Fondant is heavier than traditional <b>knife</b> <b>spread</b> frosting. Pre-made fondant that {{is available in the}} cake decorating section in stores has little flavoring. A homemade fondant can be made quickly for very little cost, and tends to have a better flavor than the pre-made store bought version.|$|R
500|$|After the Sandbar Fight and {{subsequent}} battles in which Bowie used his knife to defend himself, the Bowie knife became very popular. Many craftsmen and manufacturers {{made their own}} versions, and major cities of the Old Southwest had [...] "Bowie knife schools" [...] that taught [...] "the art of cut, thrust, and parry." [...] His fame, {{and that of his}} <b>knife,</b> <b>spread</b> to England, and by the early 1830s many British manufacturers were producing Bowie knives for shipment to the United States.

2500|$|Nuhammad and Khalid {{asked their}} friend Ayash Musa Zayn from their town to {{participate}} in the attack. The three originally planned to attack an Israeli train and gathered information about timetables, journey routes, entrances and exits, gateways and numbers of passengers passing through different stations. Muhammad and Khalid bought 30cm knives and rat poison to be <b>spread</b> on the <b>knives</b> and maximize the damage caused. They also bought suits, watches, bags, shoes and glasses. The entire cost of their equipment was around 4000 NIS. They were equipped with what appeared to be improvised [...] "carlo" [...] submachine guns to carry out the attack. They went to shooting practice to make sure that their weapons worked and hid them with Ayash along with the ammunition and the rest of their equipment. The two prevented Ayash from participating in the attack because he was in a financial debt, which according to Islamic law precludes the possibility of an individual becoming a Shahid (martyr).|$|R
50|$|Korrek and his warriors {{began to}} cross into other dimensions, {{due to a}} {{disturbance}} in various dimensions caused {{by a series of}} activities within the Man-Thing's Citrusville swamp and exacerbated by the demonic Thog. Korrek emerged in a jar of peanut butter, partially consumed by Andy Kale, <b>spread</b> with a <b>knife</b> that became his sword. Korrek encountered Jennifer Kale and the Man-Thing, and was transported to Earth when the dimensional imbalance grew stronger. He joined with the Man-Thing, as well as Howard the Duck who was also brought to Earth due to the imbalance. The odd trio was assaulted by a warrior force sent by the Congress of Realities until Dakimh the Enchanter banished the Congress. Dakimh transported the trio to his castle where they were joined by Jennifer Kale. The group traveled to Therea to prevent Thog and the Congress from overtaking that realm, and the Man-Thing was able to temporarily destroy Thog.|$|R

5000|$|Bowie {{was seriously}} {{wounded in the}} {{confrontation}} (according to one account, two bullet wounds, seven stab wounds, and other injuries due to Crain's thrown pistol, or alternatively, three bullet and four stab wounds), and required months to recover. He prominently wore a large sheath knife thereafter. Thanks to the national attention drawn by the Sandbar Fight, Bowie and his knife became well-known throughout the country as icons of a rugged frontier lifestyle. Many craftsmen and manufacturers made their own versions of the so-called Bowie knife, beginning with James Black, a blacksmith from Arkansas who designed the original for Bowie in 1830. His fame, {{and that of his}} <b>knife,</b> <b>spread</b> to England, and by the early 1830s many British knife manufacturers were also producing Bowie knives and exporting them to the United States for sale. By 1835 (while Bowie was still alive), [...] "Bowie knives" [...] were advertised (without further explanation). By 1838, a newspaper writer from New Orleans assumed that everyone had seen one. Bowie knives remained popular weapons until at least the 1870s, when large-caliber reliable pistols became widely available. The design of the knife evolved into a wide range of blades during the nineteenth century. By the middle of the twentieth century, it was associated with a more specific design: a large sheath knife with a [...] "concave clip point, sharp false edge cut from both sides, and a cross-guard to protect the user's hands".|$|R
6000|$|We {{passed the}} mortal {{remains of a}} gorilla lashed to a pole; the most {{interesting}} parts had been sold to Mr. R. B. N. Walker, and {{were on their way}} to England. I was shown for the first time the Ndámbo, or Ndambié (Bowdich, [...] "Olamboo"), which gives the india rubber of commerce; it is not a fat-leaved fig-tree (Ficus elastica of Asia) nor aeuphorbia (Siphonia elastica), as in South America, but a large climbing ficus, a cable thick as a man's leg crossing the path, and [...] "swarming up" [...] to the top of the tallest boles; the yellow fruit is tart and pleasant to the taste. In 1817 the style of collecting the gum (olamboo) was to <b>spread</b> with a <b>knife</b> the glutinous milk as it oozed from the tree over the shaved breast and arms like a plaister; it was then taken off, rolled up in balls to play with or stretched over drums, no other use being known. The Rev. Mr. Wilson declares (chap. ii.) that he [...] "first discovered the gum elastic, which has been procured, as yet, only at Corisco, Gabun, and Kama." [...] In 1854, Mr. Thompson (p. 112) found it in the Mendi country, near Sherbro; he describes it as a vine with dense bark, which yields the gum when hacked, and which becomes soft and porous when old. The juice is milk-white, thick, and glutinous, soon stiffening, darkening, and hardening without aid of art. I should like to see the raw material tried for making waterproofs in the tropics, where the best vulcanized articles never last. The Ndámbo tree has been traced a hundred miles inland from the Liberian Coast; that of the Gallinas and Sherbro is the best; at St. Paul's River it is not bad; but on the Junk River it is sticky and little prized. The difficulty everywhere is to make the negro collect it, and, when he does, to sell it un-adulterated: in East Africa he uses the small branches of the ficus for flogging canes, but will not take the trouble even to hack the [...] "Mpira" [...] tree.|$|R
