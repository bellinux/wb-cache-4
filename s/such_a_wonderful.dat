500|$|Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Gillian Reynolds {{listed the}} Doctor Who Prom {{as one of}} several {{successful}} elements in the 2008 Proms season. [...] Jenny Abramsky, the BBC's former Director of Audio and Music, praised Proms director Roger Wright [...] "for creating <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> and exciting event that clearly grabbed children's imagination." [...] Anna Picard, music correspondent for The Independent, included the Doctor Who Prom as a highlight in her year-end review of classical music in 2008. However, by April 2009 a journalist for The Sunday Times said that [...] "there have been complaints that the Proms need no more gimmicks – such as David Tennant hosting a Doctor Who prom for children last year" [...] (although Tennant did not host the Prom).|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, Dennings {{told reporters}} that the film was about to head into reshoots. In August, Taylor said he shot extra scenes with Hiddleston {{and was about to}} shoot more with Hopkins. Taylor {{explained}} that it was all a part of the [...] "Marvel process" [...] saying, [...] "We're doing full scenes, scenes that were not in the movie before. We're adding scenes, creating scenes, writing scenes for the first time. The one [...] was a fun connective scene... We realised how well Loki was working in the movie, and we wanted to do more with him. So {{it was that kind of}} thing, it was like, 'Oh, we could do this, we could jam this in here' because he's <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> guy to watch do his stuff." [...] Also in August, IMAX Corporation and Marvel Entertainment announced that the film would be digitally re-mastered into the IMAX 3D format and released into IMAX 3D theatres internationally beginning October 30, 2013.|$|E
500|$|Defence {{spending}} {{had been}} heavily cut in Chamberlain's early budgets. By 1935, {{faced with a}} resurgent Germany under Hitler's leadership, he was convinced {{of the need for}} rearmament, and was the driving force behind Defence White Papers advocating rearmament in 1936 and 1937. Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the Royal Air Force, realising that Britain's traditional bulwark, the English Channel was no defence against air power. Rearmament was an unpopular policy in Britain, and Labour attacked Chamberlain as a warmonger. Labour leader and Leader of the Opposition Clement Attlee spoke against the 1936 Budget as tremendously overspending on defence: [...] "Everything was devoted to piling up the instruments of death." [...] Churchill also criticised the National Government's defence plans, though he called for an even faster buildup. Despite the sniping from both sides, Chamberlain was very concerned about the expense of rearmament, [...] "What a frightful bill we do owe to Master Hitler, damn him! If it only wasn't for Germany, we should be having <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> time just now." ...|$|E

500|$|Breckin was {{directed}} by Olly Blackburn in the thriller film Donkey Punch; she portrayed the character Lisa and starred alongside Jaime Winstone, Nichola Burley, Tom Burke and Julian Morris. She commented to the Yorkshire Evening Post about her experience acting in the film: [...] "Filming it was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> experience. I learned an incredible amount and the team became very close. We are all incredibly proud of the film." [...] Breckin told the Irish Independent the intent was to portray realistic scenes in the film: [...] "We wanted it as realistic as possible in terms of young people having fun. Sex isn't glamorous[...]" [...] She commented to Sky News: [...] "It's about us, it's about young people. Hopefully people can identify with that. It had {{to be that the}} audience can relate to my character, that they can see how she gets herself in certain situations and how easily that can happen." [...] Donkey Punch is Breckin's first feature film. LoveFilm observed that Donkey Punch is [...] "acted with conviction by a cast of newcomers".|$|E
500|$|Early press {{coverage}} was [...] "mixed", generally {{a combination of}} [...] "embarrassment and puzzlement". The historical novelist and poet Maurice Hewlett published {{a series of articles}} in the literary journal John O' London's Weekly, in which he concluded: [...] "And knowing children, and knowing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has legs, I decide that the Miss Carpenters have pulled one of them." [...] The Sydney newspaper Truth on 5 January 1921 expressed a similar view; [...] "For the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not a knowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children." [...] Some public figures were more sympathetic. Margaret McMillan, the educational and social reformer, wrote: [...] "How wonderful that to these dear children <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> gift has been vouchsafed." [...] The novelist Henry De Vere Stacpoole decided to take the fairy photographs and the girls at face value. In a letter to Gardner he wrote: [...] "Look at Alice's [...] face. Look at Iris's [...] face. There is an extraordinary thing called Truth which has 10million faces and forms– it is God's currency and the cleverest coiner or forger can't imitate it." ...|$|E

Following the announcement, DePonte admitted that he was surprised by the nomination and had not felt similar emotions since learning of his invitation to join the orchestra 26 years earlier: [...] "I am completely overwhelmed. I had no idea the recording had been submitted." [...] DePriest said: [...] "The credit goes to Mary Tooze for making the recording possible, to Niel for his fine playing and to Tomas for writing <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> piece. I am thrilled for everyone concerned." [...] Svoboda said of the nomination: [...] "The prestige goes to the orchestra. This is a great moment for our symphony." [...] The Oregon Symphony's director of public relations commented: [...] "The running joke is that forever more, the name of this organization is 'The Grammy-nominated Oregon Symphony Orchestra.'

500|$|The {{character}} of Massive Dynamic founder William Bell was originally {{meant to be}} revealed earlier in the first season, but the writers changed their minds as the show progressed. In early April 2009, Entertainment Weekly announced that Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy had been cast as Bell. He and Fringe co-creator J.J. Abrams already had a relationship after working together on the 2009 film Star Trek; Abrams stated {{in an interview that}} he called Nimoy and begged him to join Fringe, explaining the show and the character. Nimoy sounded interested but wanted to become more familiar with the show, so Abrams and the other producers sent him as much information as they could about Fringe, until Nimoy agreed. This exchange of phone calls, in which Nimoy responded with interest when pitched the idea, was also how Abrams was able to cast him in his Star Trek reboot. Nimoy later explained [...] "When they contacted me about working on Fringe -- the same people, the same attitude, the same creativity, the same creative team – it was very enticing". According to Abrams, [...] "The idea that he will play the mysterious, much-referenced William Bell is a thrill. I know I sound like a goofy fan boy, but I can’t help it: Leonard is an icon of the genre and <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> actor. To have him come on board Fringe is a mind-blowing honor".|$|E
500|$|On 28 October 2009 it was {{announced}} that Windsor had quit the show and would leave in 2010 after 15 years. She said: [...] "EastEnders has been wonderful to me and it's no secret that it changed my life all of those years ago. I'll be so sad to leave Peggy behind; she's <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> character to play. I have had the pleasure of working with a marvellous cast and crew and have made many lasting good friends. To have had the honour of showing the Queen around the set is something that will stay with me forever." [...] Executive producer Diederick Santer said: [...] "Barbara has contributed so much to EastEnders over the last 15 years, plus countless episodes, and countless amazing storylines. Peggy Mitchell is a truly iconic character, and along with Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp, Barbara has made the Mitchells the premier family of British soap." [...] Windsor filmed her final scene on 16 July 2010. Peggy's final episode, which aired on 10 September 2010, was preceded by a number of television trailers in August and a new section on the EastEnders website dedicated to the character. The episode ended with a special reworking of the piano version of the EastEnders theme tune known as [...] "Julia's Theme", called [...] "Peggy's Theme". Tribute was then paid to her in a clip programme, Peggy Mitchell: Queen of the Vic. [...] Peggy's final episode attracted 10.1 million viewers, and was the second most-watched programme in the week of 6–12 September.|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Human Nature" [...] was written and {{composed}} for Michael Jackson by Steve Porcaro of Toto. Porcaro recorded a rough demo of the song on a cassette. He had written the song after his first-grade daughter came home crying because a boy pushed her off the slide. He blurted out three reasons for the incident to comfort her: one, the boy liked her, two, people can be strange and three, it's human nature. Fellow Toto band member David Paich gave the demo tape, along {{with two of his}} own songs, to producer Quincy Jones, hoping they would be used by Jackson. Jones did not think Paich's songs were right for Jackson's current work, but enjoyed the rough demo of [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{at the end of the}} cassette. Jones explained, [...] "All of a sudden, at the end, there was all this silence, there was: 'why, why, dah dah da-dum dah dah, why, why'. Just a dummy lyric and a very skeletal thing—I get goosebumps talking about it. I said, 'This is where we wanna go, because it's got <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> flavor'". However, Jones was dissatisfied with the original lyrics and so John Bettis, who had written lyrics for hits by the Carpenters and the Pointer Sisters, among others, was asked to add lyrics to the song. He completed the song in two days. The producer asked if the song could be included on Jackson's album, to which Porcaro and Bettis agreed. [...] "Human Nature" [...] was the last song selected for Thriller, ousting [...] "Carousel" [...] from the final track listing.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{literary}} movement, McOndo then included like ideologies {{of literature and}} technique with which to communicate {{the experience of being}} Latin American in McOndo. Yet, the McOndos are quasi-apolitical, unlike the mid–20th-century Magical Realist novelists, for whom political discourse was the raison d’être of being a public intellectual. Nevertheless, the 21st-century modernity of McOndo orients it away from utopian [...] Left-wing ideology (national identity, imperialism, colonialism, et cetera) to the politics of the 20th century, which include [...] "a global, mixed, diverse, urban, twenty-first-century-Latin America, bursting on TV; and apparent in music, art, fashion, film, and journalism; hectic and unmanageable." [...] In the 21st century, contemporary Latin America is an historico–cultural hybrid of the 19th and the 21st centuries (cf. the dictator novel and the banana republic). In the event, the writers of the McOndo (1996) short-story anthology took discrete literary paths; Alberto Fuguet noted that [...] "divergence, for certain, was expected, for McOndo was not a deal, nor a treaty, nor a sect." [...] Later, some McOndos reneged their literary militancy against Magical Realism; Edmundo Paz Soldán observed that [...] "today, it is very clear, for many of us, that it is naïve to renounce <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> tradition of political engagement {{on the part of the}} Latin American writer".|$|E
