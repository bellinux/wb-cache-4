40|$|The method {{involves}} {{grouping of}} the <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> spectral values in scale factor bands, before coding via an intensity-stereo method, {{so that one}} channel carries the intensity-stereo coded <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> spectral values and the other channel carries <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> spectral values equal to zero. The intensity-stereo coded <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> coded values are decoded for each scale factor band and a prediction method is used to provide the coded <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> spectral values for the other channel. ADVANTAGE - Reduced bit rate for increased data transmission rate without impaired quality...|$|R

40|$|WO 200143503 A UPAB: 20011108 NOVELTY - The <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> signal {{processing}} device uses {{analysis of the}} <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> signal for determining the bit quantity required by a coder for coding the <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> signal, both <b>stereo</b> channels (L,R) modified when the bit quantity is above a given value, so that {{the energy of the}} sum signal for both modified channels (L',R') has a predetermined ratio relative to the sum signal for the initial channels. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM for a <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> {{signal processing}} method is also included. USE - The processing device is used for coding <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> signals.

40|$|The coding {{method has}} the <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> {{spectral}} values grouped into scale factor bands (28), with formation of sections each containing {{at least one}} scale factor band. The audio spectral values are coded within each section using a coding table selected {{from a number of}} coding tables. Each coding table is identified by a coding table number transmitted alongside the coded <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> spectral values. An additional coding table number is transmitted for an intensity stereo coding method, or an adaptive Huffman coding method for the <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> spectral values.
