Elberta {{students}} continue to Foley High School (9-12) in Foley, {{with the exception}} of those who go on to attend the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program in Fairhope, Alabama. In addition, there is one private school in Elberta; Saint Benedict's Catholic School. The school was founded in 1921 and serves the six surrounding parishes of: St. Bartholomew, Elberta, St. Margaret of Scotland, Foley, St. Joseph, Lillian, Our Lady of the Gulf, Gulf Shores and St. Thomas by the <b>Sea,</b> <b>Orange</b> Beach.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} and activity of deoxyribonucleases in the cortex and endosome sections from a sponge, the <b>sea</b> <b>orange</b> Tethya aurantium, were investigated. The maximal enzyme activity in sponge homogenate was detected at pH 4. 27, pH 7. 0 and pH 8. 5 – 8. 75. Among different specimens, several distinct patterns of neutral DNase isozymes {{were observed in}} the cortex section. In each investigated specimen the highest neutral DNase activity belonged to high molecular weight proteins (up to 75 kDa). The acid DNases showed {{a low level of}} enzyme activity. In the endosome section the acid DNase activity was up to ten times higher than in the cortex and the presence of DNase II-like protein was detected. Neutral DNase, which expressed the highest enzyme activity in all the investigated specimens, has a molecular weight of 20 kDa and belongs to the DNase I-like family. The results indicate that the activity of neutral and acid DNases is related to sponge sections and their biological functions. The cortex, as the sponge section that communicates with the environment, expresses high interindividual variability and heterogeneity of neutral DNases, while the endosome section, where the intracellular digestion is localized, is a site of high acid DNase activity...|$|E

5000|$|Cucumaria miniata is {{commonly}} known as the <b>orange</b> <b>sea</b> cucumber or red sea cucumber due to its striking color.

50|$|Davidaster rubiginosus or the <b>orange</b> <b>sea</b> lily is {{a species}} of crinoid in the family Comasteridae.

50|$|Ptilosarcus gurneyi, the <b>orange</b> <b>sea</b> pen or fleshy sea pen, is {{a species}} of sea pen in the family Pennatulidae.

It has received its common name because of its resemblance to a quill in a bottle of ink.|$|R
50|$|In a {{study in}} Jamaica, it was found that, unlike many {{tropical}} crinoids, the <b>orange</b> <b>sea</b> lily has a regular annual breeding cycle involving the release into the sea of gametes in the late autumn and winter. After fertilisation the eggs hatch into barrel-shaped vitellaria larva with several rings of cilia. These do not feed {{and after a few}} days settle on the seabed and undergo metamorphosis into juvenile sea lilies.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} and documented that Pisaster ochraceus has very striking colors, but the reasons behind the coloration are still unknown. Three coloration categories were determined and used for a feeding trial study to investigate the effects of diet on coloration in Pisaster ochraceus. This study involved 30 hand collected individuals from the Pisaster ochraceus population at Strawberry Hill that were studied over a six week period. Individuals were selected based on coloration, 10 orange, 10 maroon, and 10 purple and were roughly the same size. The individuals were {{brought back to the}} Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC) and held in six outdoor tanks pumped constantly with sea water from the HMSC sea water system sourced in Yaquina Bay. Each tank received hand collected and cleaned prey often enough to simulate “unlimited prey”. Each coloration group was divided in half and fed different prey: five <b>orange</b> <b>sea</b> stars received Mytilus californianus and five <b>orange</b> <b>sea</b> stars were fed Pollicipes polymerus, and the same methods were applied to each of the two maroon tanks and two purple tanks. The results of this study provide more clues and direction for further investigation into the details of coloration of Pisaster ochraceus...|$|R
50|$|Using their root-like peduncles {{to anchor}} {{themselves}} in sandy or muddy substrate, the exposed portion of sea pens may rise up to 2 m in some species, {{such as the}} tall sea pen (Funiculina quadrangularis). Sea pens are sometimes brightly coloured; the <b>orange</b> <b>sea</b> pen (Ptilosarcus gurneyi) is a notable example. Rarely found above depths of 10 m, sea pens prefer deeper waters where turbulence {{is less likely to}} uproot them. Some species may inhabit depths of 2000 m or more.|$|R
25|$|Serving aboard Salisbury as ship's surgeon {{during this}} period was Lieutenant James Lind, who carried out several {{experiments}} during her sixth patrol in the approaches to demonstrate the effectiveness of citrus fruit as a cure for scurvy. Lind’s experiment began on 20 May 1747, when he selected a dozen men with scurvy and tested possible remedies comprising cider, elixir of vitriol, vinegar, <b>sea</b> water, <b>oranges</b> and lemons, and a purgative mixture. By the time Salisbury returned to Plymouth {{at the end of}} May, the two assigned to citrus fruit had recovered. Lind published his Treatise on the subject in 1753. Though not considered the first ever clinical trial ever conducted, Lind's experiments aboard Salisbury was the first clinical trial to include control groups. Despite Lind's findings, citrus foods were not adopted as a staple in Royal navy shipboard provisions until 1795.|$|R
50|$|Beginning on December 24, 1861, {{and lasting}} for 45 days, the largest flood in California's {{recorded}} history occurred, reaching full flood stage {{in different areas}} between January 9-12, 1862. The entire Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys were inundated for an extent of 300 mi, averaging 20 mi in breadth. State government was forced to relocate from the capital in Sacramento for 18 months in San Francisco. The rain created an inland <b>sea</b> in <b>Orange</b> County, lasting about three weeks with water standing 4 ft deep up to 4 mi from the river.The Los Angeles basin was flooded from the San Gabriel Mountains to the Palos Verdes Peninsula, at variable depths, excluding the higher lands which became islands until the waters receded. The Los Angeles basin lost 200,000 cattle by way of drowning, as well as homes, ranches, farm crops & vineyards being swept-away.|$|R

50|$|The <b>orange</b> <b>sea</b> pen {{feeds on}} {{plankton}} which it catches with the tentacles on its feathery plumes. It orients itself {{at right angles}} to the current and can relocate to a new location if it wishes. Breeding takes place when eggs and sperm are produced by the autozooids and expelled through the mouth into the water column. The planula larvae drift as part of the plankton before settling on the seabed and undergoing metamorphosis. The newly formed juveniles are the founding primary polyps of new colonies.|$|R
50|$|Certain starfish prey on the <b>orange</b> <b>sea</b> pen. It can {{distinguish}} between the threats posed by the specialist predator leather star (Dermasterias imbricata), the generalist predator sunflower seastar (Pycnopodia helianthoides) and the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus), which does not feed on sea pens. It reacts by emitting {{a flash of light}} and diving into the sand when contact is made by the leather star, sometimes behaves similarly when approached by the sunflower seastar and does not react defensively when touched by the ochre sea star.|$|R
5000|$|The {{attack was}} over in two minutes and left the hilltop a <b>sea</b> of <b>orange</b> flame. Survivors plunged fifty feet down the slope to escape the burning napalm. Maj.

Acting quickly, he assembled about thirty men and led them back up the hill before approaching North Koreans reached the top. There, two bursts of automatic fire mortally wounded him as he and Maj. A. I. Gordon-Ingram, B Company commander, fired a 2-inch mortar. According to his Victoria Cross citation, Muir's last words as he was carried from the hilltop were [...] "The Gooks will never drive the Argylls off this hill".|$|R
