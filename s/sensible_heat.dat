The mechanisms considered include changed orography, sea surface temperature anomalies, tropical heating, regional heating in the Pacific area, land-sea contrast, and <b>sensible</b> <b>heating</b> in the Antarctic area. It is concluded that asymmetric heating due to land-sea contrast was the most important boundary forcing associated with maintenance of the block. A 'no Australia' experiment confirms this result and suggests that local land-sea contrast kept the block stationary. High-latitude <b>sensible</b> <b>heating</b> associated with cold air outbreaks from Antarctica was also important in maintaining the block...|$|R
40|$|Nomograms of mean column heating due {{to surface}} <b>sensible</b> and latent <b>heat</b> fluxes were developed. Mean <b>sensible</b> <b>heating</b> {{of the cloud}} free region {{is related to the}} cloud free path (CFP, the {{distance}} from the shore to the first cloud formation) and the difference between land air and sea surface temperatures, theta sub 1 and theta sub 0, respectively. Mean latent heating is related to the CFP and the difference between land air and sea surface humidities q sub 1 and q sub 0 respectively. Results are also applicable to any path within the cloud free region. Corresponding heat fluxes may be obtained by multiplying the mean heating by the mean wind speed in the boundary layer. The <b>sensible</b> <b>heating</b> estimated by the present method is found to be in good agreement with that computed from the bulk transfer formula. The sensitivity of the solutions to the variations in the initial coastal soundings and large scale subsidence is also investigated. The results are not sensitive to divergence but are affected by the initial lapse rate of potential temperature; the greater the stability, the smaller the heating, other things being equal. Unless one knows the lapse rate at the shore, this requires another independent measurement. For this purpose the downwind slope of the square of the boundary layer height is used, the mean value of which is also directly proportional to the mean <b>sensible</b> <b>heating.</b> The height of the boundary layer should be measurable by future spaceborn lidar systems...|$|R

40|$|Cold fronts in both hemispheres {{commonly}} develop {{over the}} ocean before making landfall on the upstream coastlines of the continents. As the fronts undergo landfall they interact with sharp gradients in heating at the coastline, diurnal cycles of heating inland of the coastline, and on some continents orography. The effects of land surfaces, sea surfaces, coastlines and orography on the dynamics of cold fronts are examined in an idealised two-dimensional confluent deformation model of frontogenesis. When the deformation field is stationary, increasing the surface roughness weakens the fronts, while increasing the cross-front ageostrophic wind and frontal updrafts. The frontogenetic effect of deformation balances the frontolytic effect of turbulent mixing, resulting in near steady-state fronts. In steady state the surface fronts are located near {{the point at which}} the point the cro::;s-front flow vani::;hes. This equilibrium point moves towards the warm air as the surface roughness is increased because the cross-front ageostrophic wind also increases with increasing surface roughness. Surface <b>sensible</b> <b>heating</b> weakens and slows the front::; during the day, whereas surface sensible cooling strengthens and accelerates them at night. Adding a coastline to the model results in very strong gravity-current like fronts in the afternoon with a relative flow of cool air towards their leading edge. Above the boundary layer the synoptic fronts remain unaffected by the coastline. As the turbulent mixing weakens in the late afternoon, the coastal fronts surge inland, advancing faster than the windspeed in the boundary layer. When the deformation field is allowed to translate, the fronts advance across the ocean towards land. If the fronts reached the coastline between mid-morning and late afternoon, the daytime heating over the land oppose::; the on::;hore advection of cold air, retarding the fronts at the coastline. If the fronts reached the coastline in the evening or early morning, they advance onshore relatively unimpeded. Adding a bell-shaped mountain results in weakening on the upwind slope and a strengthening on the lee slope, with both insulated and free-slip surfaces. The effect of turbulent mixing is to give the fronts a much more constant speed as they cross the mountain. A transition from subcritical flow to supercritical flow is found when increasing the mountain height or decreasing the mountain width. Nocturnal cooling has a similar response of weakening on the upwind slope and strengthening on the lee slope. Surface <b>sensible</b> <b>heating</b> weakens the front on both sides of the mountain as increased turbulent mixing overwhelms the effect of the mountain circulation. Increased upstream strengthening and slowing occurs when a coastline is added on the upstream slope of the mountain in the absence of <b>sensible</b> <b>heating.</b> In the combination of <b>sensible</b> <b>heating,</b> orography and a coastline similar results are found to a combination of numerical experiments with a coastline, sellsible heating and no orography and numerical experiments with no coastline, <b>sensible</b> <b>heating</b> and orography...|$|R
40|$|Energy balance {{models have}} proven useful in {{understanding}} mechanisms and feedbacks {{in the climate}} system. An original global energy balance model is presented here. The model is solved numerically for equilibrium climate states defined by zonal average temperature {{as a function of}} latitude for both a surface and an atmospheric layer. The effects of radiative, latent, and <b>sensible</b> <b>heating</b> are parameterized. The model includes a variable lapse rate and parameterizations of the major dynamical mechanisms responsible for meridional heat transport: the Hadley cell, midlatitude baroclinic eddies, and ocean circulation. The model reproduces both the mean variation of temperature with latitude and the global average heat budget within the uncertainty of observations. The utility of the model is demonstrated through examination of various climate feedbacks. One impor-tant feedback is the effect of the lapse rate on climate. When the planet warms {{as a result of an}} increase in the solar constant, the lapse rate acts as a negative feedback, effectively enhancing the longwave emission efficiency of the atmosphere. The lapse rate is also responsible for an increase in global average temperature when the meridional heat transport effectiveness is increased. The water vapor feedback enhances tem-perature changes, while the latent and <b>sensible</b> <b>heating</b> feedback reduces surface temperature changes. 1...|$|R
500|$|There {{are several}} {{difficulties}} with satellite-based absolute SST measurements. First, in infrared remote sensing methodology the radiation emanates {{from the top}} [...] "skin" [...] of the ocean, approximately the top 0.01 mm or less, which may not represent the bulk temperature of the upper meter of ocean due primarily to effects of solar surface heating during the daytime, reflected radiation, as well as <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> loss and surface evaporation. All these factors make it somewhat difficult to compare satellite data to measurements from buoys or shipboard methods, complicating ground truth efforts. [...] Secondly, the satellite cannot look through clouds, creating a cool bias in satellite-derived SSTs within cloudy areas. [...] However, passive microwave techniques can accurately measure SST and penetrate cloud cover. [...] Within atmospheric sounder channels on weather satellites, which peak just above the ocean's surface, knowledge of the sea surface temperature is important to their calibration.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone's {{primary energy}} source is heat from the evaporation {{of water from the}} ocean surface, which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when the warm moist air rises and cools to saturation. The energetics of the system may be idealized as an atmospheric Carnot heat engine. First, inflowing air near the surface acquires heat primarily via evaporation of water (i.e. latent heat) at the temperature of the warm ocean surface (during evaporation, the ocean cools and the air warms). Second, the warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat content (latent heat is simply converted to <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> during condensation). Third, air outflows and loses heat via infrared radiation to space at the temperature of the cold tropopause. Finally, air subsides and warms at {{the outer edge of the}} storm while conserving total heat content. [...] The first and third legs are nearly isothermal, while the second and fourth legs are nearly isentropic. This in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the secondary circulation. [...] The Carnot perspective provides an upper bound on the maximum wind speed that a storm can attain.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, many energy {{units for}} {{measurement}} of heat have been used. The standards-based {{unit in the}} International System of Units (SI) is the joule (J). Heat is measured by {{its effect on the}} states of interacting bodies, for example, by the amount of ice melted or a change in temperature. [...] The quantification of heat via the temperature change of a body is called calorimetry, and is widely used in practice. [...] In calorimetry, <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> is defined with respect to a specific chosen state variable of the system, such as pressure or volume. <b>Sensible</b> <b>heat</b> causes a change of the temperature of the system while leaving the chosen state variable unchanged. Heat transfer that occurs at a constant system temperature but changes the state variable is called latent heat with respect to the variable. For infinitesimal changes, the total incremental heat transfer is then the sum of the latent and <b>sensible</b> <b>heat.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Long-term {{trends in}} annual {{evaporation}} and watershed Bowen ratio were studied on 51 eastern United States watersheds which had experienced an estimated 0 – 58 % urban/residential development between 1920 and 1990. Annual watershed evaporation was estimated as {{the difference between}} annual streamflow and average watershed precipitation, corrected for watershed elevation effects and gage catch error. Annual watershed Bowen ratios were estimated using spatially and temporally averaged net radiation values and annual evaporation. Significant (a 5 0. 1) positive trends in annual watershed Bowen ratio and negative trends in evaporation were found for 12 and 10 watersheds, respectively, of 28 watersheds with. 2 % urban/residential development and only 2 and 3 watersheds, respectively, of 23 watersheds with, 2 % development. Trend results lead to estimates of the overall change in water and energy balances which were separately related to the percentage change in urban/residential area for all 51 watersheds. These regional relationships, linking watershed hydrology, energy exchange, and land use changes, showed significant decreases in watershed evaporation and significant increases in <b>sensible</b> <b>heating</b> of the atmosphere with increased urban/residential development on watersheds in the eastern United States.

2500|$|A {{complementary}} observable {{aspect of}} the first law is about heat transfer. Adynamic transfer of energy as heat can be measured empirically by changes in the surroundings {{of the system of}} interest by calorimetry. This again requires the existence of adiabatic enclosure of the entire process, system and surroundings, though the separating wall between the surroundings and the system is thermally conductive or radiatively permeable, not adiabatic. A calorimeter can rely on measurement of <b>sensible</b> <b>heat,</b> which requires the existence of thermometers and measurement of temperature change in bodies of known <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> capacity under specified conditions; or it can rely on the measurement of latent heat, through measurement of masses of material that change phase, at temperatures fixed by the occurrence of phase changes under specified conditions in bodies of known latent heat of phase change. The calorimeter can be calibrated by adiabatically doing externally determined work on it. The most accurate method is by passing an electric current from outside through a resistance inside the calorimeter. The calibration allows comparison of calorimetric measurement of quantity of heat transferred with quantity of energy transferred as work.

2500|$|The basic {{mechanism}} can {{be qualified}} {{in a number}} of ways, none of which affect the fundamental process. The atmosphere near the surface is largely opaque to thermal radiation (with important exceptions for [...] "window" [...] bands), and most heat loss from the surface is by <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> and latent heat transport.

The simple picture also assumes a steady state, but in the real world, there are variations due to the diurnal cycle as well as the seasonal cycle and weather disturbances.
