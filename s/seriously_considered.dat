5|$|Advocates for {{the diet}} {{recommend}} {{that it be}} <b>seriously</b> <b>considered</b> after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%. The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include Dravet syndrome, infantile spasms, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis complex.|$|E

5|$|Even at the 1.5m wavelength, antennas of {{practical}} size had relatively low gain and very poor resolution; the transmitter antenna created a fan-shaped signal over 90 degrees wide. This was not useful for homing on a target, so some system of direction indication was required. The team <b>seriously</b> <b>considered</b> phase comparison as a solution, {{but could not}} find a suitable phase shifting circuit.|$|E

5|$|ETNC's {{early success}} also {{attracted}} the attention of other communities in North Texas, and in 1904 Denison attempted to entice Mayo to relocate the college there for a considerable amount of financial aid. Whether or not Mayo <b>seriously</b> <b>considered</b> the offer is unknown, but he was able to use it as leverage to persuade Commerce to give the college $30,000 {{over the next three years}} for the promise that it would remain, money that was mostly used to renovate and expand ETNC's physical plant.|$|E
5|$|Ford <b>seriously</b> <b>considered</b> {{leaving the}} Senate and running for {{governor}} again in 1983 and 1991, but decided against it both times. In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his seniority in the Senate and desire to become Democratic Senate whip as factors in his decision not to run for governor.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, Whitehead {{resigned}} {{his senior}} lectureship in mathematics at Trinity {{and moved to}} London without first lining up another job. After being unemployed for a year, Whitehead accepted a position as lecturer in applied mathematics and mechanics at University College London, but was passed over a year later for the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, a position {{for which he had}} hoped to be <b>seriously</b> <b>considered.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jagger {{left school}} in 1961 after passing seven O-levels and three A-levels. With Richards, {{he moved into}} a flat in Edith Grove, Chelsea, London, with guitarist Brian Jones. While Richards and Jones planned {{to start their own}} rhythm and blues group, Blues Incorporated, Jagger {{continued}} to study business on a government grant as an undergraduate student at the London School of Economics, and had <b>seriously</b> <b>considered</b> becoming either a journalist or a politician, comparing the latter to a pop star.|$|E
5|$|Operation Tannenbaum, a {{military}} offensive intended to occupy all of Switzerland, most likely in co-operation with Italy (which itself desired the Italian-speaking areas of Switzerland), {{was in the}} planning stages during 1940-1941. Its implementation was <b>seriously</b> <b>considered</b> by the German military after the armistice with France, but it was definitively shelved after the start of Operation Barbarossa had directed the attention of the Wehrmacht elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Senator Bricker {{introduced}} another proposal {{later in}} the 83rd Congress and proposed similar constitutional amendments in the 84th and 85th Congresses. While hearings were held in the 84th and 85th Congresses, the full Senate took no action {{and the idea of}} amending the Constitution was never again <b>seriously</b> <b>considered.</b> In part, this was because the Supreme Court issued rulings that undercut arguments for it, notably in Reid v. Covert.|$|E
5|$|Several {{rumors and}} misconceptions {{have grown up}} around the film, one being that Ronald Reagan was {{originally}} chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the studio {{early on in the}} film's development, but by that time the studio already knew that he was going into the Army, and he was never <b>seriously</b> <b>considered.</b> George Raft claimed that he had turned down the lead role. Studio records make clear that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.|$|E
5|$|The first area {{of major}} dispute was the manner {{by which the}} lower house would be apportioned. A {{minority}} {{wanted it to be}} apportioned so that all states would have equal weight, though this was never <b>seriously</b> <b>considered.</b> Most wanted it apportioned in accordance with some mixture of property and population. Though there was discussion on how to calculate property for this purpose, the issue of property was later dropped because of its difficulty, and an assumption that property would closely correlate to population.|$|E

5|$|After these slights, {{speculation}} {{was raised}} that Mathias {{would leave the}} Republican Party, especially as the 1980 elections were approaching. Several prominent conservatives in the state, such as U.S. Representatives Marjorie Holt and Robert Bauman, were considering challenging Mathias for his seat. In contrast, the Democratic {{side of the aisle}} had fewer challengers, suggesting Mathias would win renomination more easily if he were to switch parties. However, Mathias chose to remain as a Republican, and teamed up with eight other Republican senators to express their dissatisfaction with the hard-line wing of the party. Mathias later stated that he had never <b>seriously</b> <b>considered</b> switching parties.|$|E
5|$|Although faster-than-light travel {{has been}} <b>seriously</b> <b>considered</b> by {{physicists}} such as Miguel Alcubierre, Tough speculates that the {{enormous amount of}} energy required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications. 2013 research at NASA's Johnson Space Center, however, shows that faster-than-light travel with the Alcubierre drive requires dramatically less energy than previously thought, needing only about 1 metric ton of exotic mass-energy to move a spacecraft at 10 times the speed of light, in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter-mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster-than-light spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Both methods offered {{advantages}} and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy <b>seriously</b> <b>considered</b> stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 {{because of the}} wear on the barrels. The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range. Heavier shells {{have the advantage of}} being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.|$|E

5|$|Goebbels {{was educated}} at a Christian Gymnasium, where he {{completed}} his Abitur (university entrance examination) in 1917. He {{was the top}} student of his class and was given the traditional honor {{to speak at the}} awards ceremony. His parents initially hoped that he would become a Catholic priest, and Goebbels <b>seriously</b> <b>considered</b> it. He studied literature and history at the universities of Bonn, Würzburg, Freiburg, and Munich, aided by a scholarship from the Albertus Magnus Society. By this time Goebbels had begun to distance himself from the church.|$|E
5|$|In November 2016, Kevin Smith {{said that}} he was open to having the Superman Lives script be adapted as an {{animated}} film, with Nicholas Cage voicing Superman and Michael Rooker voicing Lex Luthor. In October 2017, Batman vs. Two-Face writer Michael Jelenic stated that he originally pitched an animated film based on Smith's Superman Lives script, saying that Warner Bros <b>seriously</b> <b>considered</b> it for a long time. According to Jelenic, Cage would have loved to voice Superman in the film, but the idea never materialized and Jelenic's pitch was eventually abandoned.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the British {{discovery}} of the iconic Charnia in 1957 that the pre-Cambrian was <b>seriously</b> <b>considered</b> as containing life. This frond-shaped fossil was found in England's Charnwood Forest, and due to the detailed geological mapping of the British Geological Survey there was no doubt these fossils sat in Precambrian rocks. Palaeontologist Martin Glaessner finally, in 1959, made the connection between this and the earlier finds and with a combination of improved dating of existing specimens and an injection of vigour into the search many more instances were recognised.|$|E
