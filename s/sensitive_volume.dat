An electron in the semiconductor is fixed in its valence band in the crystal until a gamma ray interaction provides the electron enough energy to move to the conduction band. [...] Electrons in the conduction band can respond to the electric field in the detector, and therefore move to the positive contact that is creating the electrical field. The gap created by the moving electron is called a [...] "hole," [...] and is filled by an adjacent electron. This shuffling of holes effectively moves a positive charge to the negative contact. The arrival of the electron at the positive contact and the hole at the negative contact produces the electrical signal that is sent to the preamplifier, the MCA, and on through the system for analysis. The movement of electrons and holes in a solid-state detector is very similar to the movement of ions within the <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> of gas-filled detectors such as ionization chambers.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} demonstration of two types of devices, namely silicon microdosimeters and quantum dots {{in the field of}} classical and quantum electronics respectively. The microdosimeters, which demonstrate well-defined <b>sensitive</b> <b>volumes,</b> have significant potential for applications in regional microdosimetry. And, the highly tunable gate-defined quantum dots, which allow the observation of the single-electron regime, provide significant promise for quantum computation in coupled quantum dots. The design, fabrication and demonstration of novel cylindrical silicon-on-insulator (SOI) single-diode microdosimeters and arrayed microdosimeters is presented. The single diode structure was modelled usingTechnology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) to optimise the design parameters. Experimental characterisation using ion-beam-induced charge collection (IBICC) technique shows that the devices achieve well-defined cylindrical <b>sensitive</b> <b>volumes</b> with excellent charge collection characteristics. Results also show that arrays of these <b>sensitive</b> <b>volumes</b> can be successfully read out in a parallel mode. Next, a few-electron double quantum dot was fabricated using metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible technology and low-temperature transport measurements were performed to study the energy spectrum of the device. The double dot structure is electrically tunable, enabling the interdot coupling to be adjusted over a wide range, as observed in the charge stability diagram. Resonant single-electron tunnelling through ground and excited states of the double dot was clearly observed in bias spectroscopy measurements. Low-temperature electronic transport measurements of a silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum dot, with independent gate control of electron densities in the leads and the quantum dot island is also reported. This architecture allows the dot energy levels to be probed without affecting the electron density in the leads, and vice versa. Appropriate gate biasing enables the dot occupancy to be reduced to the single-electron level, as evidenced by magnetospectroscopy measurements of the ground state of the first two charge transitions. Independent gate control of the electron reservoirs also enables discrimination between excited states of the dot and density of states modulations in the leads...|$|R

40|$|The dose {{imparted}} {{by a small}} non-equilibrium {{photon radiation}} field to the <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> of a detector located within a water phantom depends on {{the density of the}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume.</b> Here this effect is explained using cavity theory, and analysed using Monte Carlo data calculated for schematically modelled diamond and Pinpoint-type detectors. The combined impact of the density and atomic composition of the <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> on its response is represented as a ratio, Fw,det, of doses absorbed by equal volumes of unit density water and detector material co-located within a unit density water phantom. The impact of density alone is characterized through a similar ratio, Pρ -, of doses absorbed by equal volumes of unit and modified density water. The cavity theory is developed by splitting the dose absorbed by the <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> into two components, imparted by electrons liberated in photon interactions occurring inside and outside the volume. Using this theory a simple model is obtained that links Pρ - to the degree of electronic equilibrium, see, at the centre of a field via a parameter Icav determined by the density and geometry of the <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume.</b> Following the scheme of Bouchard et al (2009 Med. Phys. 36 4654 - 63) Fw,det can be written as the product of Pρ -, the water-to-detector stopping power ratio [L[overline](Δ) /ρ](w) (det), and an additional factor Pfl -. In small fields [L[overline](Δ) /ρ](w) (det) changes little with field-size; and for the schematic diamond and Pinpoint detectors Pfl - takes values close to one. Consequently most of the field-size variation in Fw,det originates from the Pρ - factor. Relative changes in see and in the phantom scatter factor sp are similar in small fields. For the diamond detector, the variation of Pρ - with see (and thus field-size) is described well by the simple cavity model using an Icav parameter in line with independent Monte Carlo estimates. The model also captures the overall field-size dependence of Pρ - for the schematic Pinpoint detector, again using an Icav value consistent with independent estimates...|$|E

This work exploits this feature of polymer gel dosimetry to propose an experimental technique for relative output factor (OF) measurements of small radiosurgical beams. Two gel vials were irradiated with a 5 and 30 mm diameter 6 MV radiosurgery beam and MR scanned with the same slice thickness and three different in plane resolutions. Using this experimental data set, 5 mm OF measurements with the PinPoint ion chamber are simulated by integrating results over a <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> {{equal to that of}} the chamber. Results are found in agreement within experimental uncertainties with actual PinPoint measurements verifying the validity of the proposed experimental procedure. The polymer gel data set is subsequently utilized for OF measurements of the 5 mm beam with varying <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> to discuss the magnitude of detector volume averaging effects.
