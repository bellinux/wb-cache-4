2500|$|It fired a 6mm (0.236-in. caliber) cartridge, {{which used}} an early {{smokeless}} powder, was <b>semi-rimless,</b> and fired a 135-grain (later 112-grain) jacketed bullet.

2500|$|By 1894, the U.S. Navy {{desired to}} adopt a modern small-bore, {{smokeless}} powder rifle in keeping with other first-line naval powers. [...] Naval authorities decided that the new cartridge should be adaptable to both rifles and machine guns. [...] As the military forces began adopting smaller and smaller caliber rifles with higher velocity cartridges, U.S. naval authorities decided to leapfrog developments by adopting a <b>semi-rimless</b> cartridge in 6-mm caliber, with a case capable of holding a heavy charge of smokeless powder. [...] On August 1, 1894 a naval test board was convened at the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island to test submitted magazine rifles in the new 6mm Navy government chambering. [...] Per {{the terms of the}} Notice to Inventors, the new government-designed 6mm U.S.N a.k.a. Ball Cartridge, 6mm was the only cartridge permitted for rifles tested before the Naval Small Arms Board. [...] Both the ammunition and rifle barrels were supplied by the government; the barrels, made of 4.5 per cent nickel steel, used Metford-pattern rifling with a rifling twist of one turn in 6.5inches, and were supplied unchambered with the receiver thread uncut. [...] The rifle action was required to withstand the firing of five overpressure (proof) cartridges with a chamber pressure of 60,000 psi.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{factor in}} {{the demise of the}} 6mm Lee was its bullet; the 6mm Lee was adopted prior to the {{invention}} of the spitzer-shape bullet. As a result, the light, roundnosed 6mm bullet lost much of its effectiveness at 600–700 yards, while the [...] roundnosed bullet of the [...]30 Army service cartridge was still considered effective at ranges of 1,000 yards or more, an important consideration in the days when rifle and indirect machine gun fire at distant targets such as massed enemy infantry was considered necessary. [...] While by no means a universal opinion, the lack of shocking power of the 6mm Lee reported by some Marine units in combat may also have weighed against the idea of delaying a change to the [...]30 Army for all services. A further complication was that issues of barrel wear from the Riflelite smokeless powder and corrosive primer used in the 6mm cartridge continued to plague Navy ordnance authorities. Finally, due in part to its long, thick-gauged <b>semi-rimless</b> rim case and beveled rim, the 6mm Lee {{was one of the most}} expensive service cartridges to produce in terms of cost per round, yet it was already becoming obsolescent in comparison to ammunition that used more efficient powders and true rimless cases. [...] Rapid developments in military small arms ammunition would soon demonstrate the advantages of a magazine-fed rifle and machine gun cartridge with a rimless case and spitzer bullet, features not found in either the [...]30 Army or the 6mm Lee.|$|E

5000|$|Also in the 1920s, a {{new style}} {{appeared}} in which an [...] "arch" [...] connected the bridge to the temples, to provide extra stability for the lenses; the mounting technique {{was referred to as}} [...] "Shurset" [...] ("sure set"). Although the design would be considered a variant of [...] "semi-rimless" [...] glasses {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century, the style was considered rimless upon its inception because no part of the lens was secured inside of a frame; modern <b>semi-rimless</b> eyewear features lenses partially secured inside of a half-frame, with the lower portion of the lens held in place by nylon wire. Though traditionally called [...] "Rimways," [...] this variation was also referred to as Cortland style. A variation utilizing only two screws and which only secured the lenses to the bridge was called the Numont or the Two Screw Cortland; the removal of the temporal screws was considered to be a cosmetic improvement.|$|E
