2500|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle {{is an important}} process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N2 from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by phytoplankton as N2 so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by cyanobacteria. Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle, the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years. Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter. [...] Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the euphotic zone by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, or <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the euphotic zone. Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the euphotic zone. Ammonification or Mineralization is performed by bacteria to convert organic nitrogen to ammonia. Nitrification can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrate can {{be returned to the}} euphotic zone by vertical mixing and upwelling where it can be taken up by phytoplankton to continue the cycle. N2 can be returned to the atmosphere through denitrification.|$|E
40|$|Aquatic sediments are the {{ultimate}} <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> dispersed in freshwater and soil. They are therefore {{a useful tool for}} investigating polluted ecosystems. Lagoon environments are very difficult to study due to their unstable morphology. Under these circumstances, even an excellent environmental investigation of a restricted lagoon area would still be inadequate to appreciate the characteristics of the entire system. The Venice lagoon is a very complex ecosystem whose morphology is complicated further by extensive anthropic intervention. A good environmental representation of the area was obtained with a preliminary radiochemical survey of airborne radionuclides, a unique tool in evaluating the homogeneity of the entire sedimentary system. It must be stressed, however, that the significance of the data depends substantially on the use of qualified procedures. Based on this, a detailed study was carried out on selected homogeneous areas, reconstructing the inventories and fluxes of pollutants in the sediments. In this work the radiochemical approach to the environmental study of the Venice lagoon is examine...|$|R
40|$|The {{changes in}} the biofilm {{community}} due to organic matter enrichment, eutrophication and metal contamination derived from fish farming were studied. The biofilm biomass, polysaccharide content, trophic niche and element accumulation were quantified along an environmental gradient <b>of</b> fish farm <b>wastes</b> in two seasons. Biofilm structure and trophic diversity was influenced by seasonality {{as well as by}} the fish farm waste load. Fish farming enhanced the accumulation of organic carbon, nutrients, selenium and metals by the biofilm community. The accumulation pattern of these elements was similar regardless of the structure and trophic niche of the community. This suggests that the biofilm communities can be considered a reliable tool for assessing dissolved aquaculture wastes. Due to the ubiquity of biofilms and its wide range of consumers, its role as a <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> dissolved <b>wastes</b> may have important implications for the transfer <b>of</b> aquaculture <b>wastes</b> to higher trophic levels in coastal systems. This work was funded by the project AGL 2004 - 08350 -C 02 - 01 /ACU from the Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología, a predoctoral grant to C.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} the dispersion of pollutants released from a marine fish farm in the Ligurian Sea (Western Mediterranean), the Lagrangian particle model LAMP 3 D has been nested into the numerical hydrodynamical model POM. Estimates of the regional dispersion patterns of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon were calculated using a three-dimensional mesoscale grid and compared to in situ experimental data. In the numerical simulations, the dispersion <b>of</b> different aquaculture <b>wastes</b> (dissolved nutrients, faecal matter and feed wastes) was evaluated by changing the rates of particles settling and their condition of release (continuous or periodical). Results of the simulations clearly showed that dissolved particles tend to spread rapidly and undergo rapid dilution depending on dominant wind and surface currents direction. In contrast, settling particles remain mainly confined in the fish farm area and readily <b>sink.</b> Predicted concentrations <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> were low in both the water column and sediment compartments and never exceed the threshold of environmental crises.

40|$|Accumulation of {{phosphorus}} in soil is a {{major factor}} limiting the operational life (period of time where the soil can serve as an effective phosphorus <b>sink)</b> <b>of</b> land application <b>waste</b> disposal systems. Better evaluation of phosphorus operational life requires improved understanding of how manure application to soil can affect its phosphorus sorption characteristics. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of feedlot runoff effluent application on phosphorus sorption capacities, equilibrium phosphorus concentrations, and phosphorus buffering capacities of six Iowa soils. Soil samples were collected from vegetative treatment areas that had received feedlot runoff application for the previous five years and from a paired grassed area that did not. Subsamples of each soil were incubated with a series of 12 phosphorus solutions ranging in concentration from 0 to 200 mg P/L to determine the sorption characteristics and results fitted to the Langmuir model to determine the phosphorus equilibrium concentration, phosphorus buffering capacity, and maximum phosphorus sorption capacity. Results indicated that vegetative treatment areas generally had elevated phosphorus equilibrium concentrations, indicating an elevated risk of loss of dissolved phosphorus. In most cases, the ability of the soil to sorb phosphorus was significantly increased, as was the remaining phosphorus sorption capacity of the soil. These results indicate that vegetative treatment area life could be greatly extended due to soil property modifications that occur as a result of system operation...|$|R

40|$|Waste {{minimization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important interventions that can help sustain industrial production without compounding onslaughts due to pollution on environmental <b>sinks.</b> The importance <b>of</b> this intervention cannot be overemphaiszed. This has been proved by several instances across different sectors clearly highlighting economic benefits of resource conservation and avoidance <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b> Several rules and regulations have tended to curb firms from generating excessively large quantities <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> especially in conjunction with the diversity and intensity of impacts they generate.
