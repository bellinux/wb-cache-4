2500|$|Gravers come in {{a variety}} of shapes and sizes that yield {{different}} line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines incised into them, used to do fill work on larger areas or to create uniform shade lines that are fast to execute. Ring gravers are made with particular shapes that are used by jewelry engravers in order to cut inscriptions inside rings. Flat gravers are used for fill work on letters, as well as [...] "wriggle" [...] cuts on most musical instrument engraving work, remove background, or create bright cuts. Knife gravers are for line engraving and very deep cuts. Round gravers, and flat gravers with a radius, are commonly used on silver to create bright cuts (also called bright-cut engraving), as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and <b>steel.</b> <b>Square</b> or V-point gravers are typically square or elongated diamond-shaped and used for cutting straight lines. V-point can be anywhere from 60 to 130 degrees, depending on purpose and effect. These gravers have very small cutting points. Other tools such as mezzotint rockers, roulets and burnishers are used for texturing effects. Burnishing tools can also be used for certain stone setting techniques.|$|E

Carpenters use various {{tools to}} lay out {{structures}} that are square (that is, built at accurately measured right angles), {{many of which are}} made of steel, but the name <b>steel</b> <b>square</b> refers to a specific long-armed square that has additional uses for measurement, especially of various angles.

50|$|The 3100 ft {{of track}} {{is made of}} six layers of {{laminated}} wood, with a <b>steel</b> <b>square</b> tube acting as the topmost layer of track. The <b>steel</b> <b>square</b> tube is known as Topper Track and is found on many roller coasters that Rocky Mountain Construction has renovated, as well as Outlaw Run. This track style is designed to reduce the maintenance typically required for a wooden roller coaster {{and to provide a}} smoother ride experience. Rocky Mountain Construction spent four years developing technology to allow them to twist beams of wood, that make up the lower layers of the track. This track configuration allows for more dynamic roller coaster elements to be performed on a wooden roller coaster.|$|E
50|$|The {{side cut}} {{is located at}} the {{intersection}} of the side cut of jack rafters row and the pitch column on the <b>Steel</b> <b>square.</b> There is a row for the difference in length of jacks, 16 and 24 inch centers on the blade. The tangents are directly proportional for both centers.The tangent is in a base 12. The tangent x 12 = side cut of jack rafters. This corresponds to the side cut on the <b>Steel</b> <b>square.</b> The complementary angles of the arc tan are used on most angle measuring devises in construction. The tangent of hip, valley, and jack rafters are less than 1.00 in all pitches above 0°. An eighteen pitch has a side cut angle of 29.07° and a two pitch has a side cut angle of 44.56° for jack rafters. This is a variation of 15.5° between pitches.|$|E

50|$|A painted stick from 2300 BCE {{found in}} China {{is the oldest}} known gnomon. Anaximander (610-546 BC) is {{credited}} with introducing this Babylonian instrument to the Greeks. Oenopides used the phrase drawn gnomon-wise to describe a line drawn perpendicular to another. Later, the term was used for an L-shaped instrument like a <b>steel</b> <b>square</b> used to draw right angles. This shape may explain its use to describe a shape formed by cutting a smaller square from a larger one. Euclid extended the term to the plane figure formed by removing a similar parallelogram from a corner of a larger parallelogram. Indeed, the gnomon is the increment between two successive figurate numbers, including square and triangular numbers.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{chemistry}} of the build-up of soil resulting from milk handling operations. This study was developed to find {{the nature of the}} presoil and its contribution to the fate of the microflora. The microenvironment in soil on milk handling equipment is dependent upon available water as influenced by humidity in the atmosphere. The effect of RH (80, 86, 93, and 100 %) was, therefore, studied using milk products as the soiling. Varying combinations of whole, raw milk and other milk constituents were layered on 1 cm 2 stainless steel surfaces and studied with exposure to controlled humidities. Varying humidity levels were found to have a selective effect on the microflora of the raw milk film. The lower RH (80 %) showed an inhibition of the gram-negative bacteria, while the higher RH (100 %) enhanced the growth of gram-negative bacteria. Stacking and clamping of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>squares,</b> to simulate harborages, produced a microflora similar to that found with a single layer of raw milk using 100 % RH. By reducing the surface area of the film exposed to the atmosphere, more water was made available to the bacterial cells of the milk-soil film. A similar retardation in loss of moisture was obtained through presoiling. Presoiling, to simulate incomplete cleaning plus a layer of raw milk, followed by incubation at 25 C, resulted in a visible yellow film similar to a type of “milkstone” encountered under field conditions. Key constituents were presoiled on stainless <b>steel</b> <b>squares</b> followed by a subsequent film of raw milk. Phospholipids were found to be necessary in the production of the yellow film. Another necessity for the production of the yellow film was growth of bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas. Evaluation of the yellow film produced in the laboratory found its production to be dependent on the following factors: 1) inadequate cleaning to yield a presoil of phospholipids, 2) growth of Pseudomonas sp., 3) high population density, and 4) available water.

40|$|Effects of {{loading path}} on the {{ultimate}} {{strength and the}} moment-curvature relation of composite cross sections subjected to axial load and biaxial bending were investigated analyzing four kinds of cross section : steel wide-width H-shape, <b>steel</b> <b>square</b> tube, concrete-filled <b>steel</b> <b>square</b> tube and SRC containing steel wide-width H-shape. Three types of loading path were considered : i) monotonically increasing bending moment Mx with constant My, ⅱ) proportional loading with a constant ratio of bending moments, My/Mx, and ⅲ) proportional deformation with a constant ratio of biaxial curvatures, Φy/Φx. It {{was found that the}} same point on the ultimate strength interaction was reached regardless of the loading paths, the maximum values of bending moments may be different from those at the ultimate strength point on the interaction, {{in the case of the}} cross section of which flexural strengths about two principal axes were largely different, and the strength deterioration after the maximum strength attained appears most severely in the case of loading type with constant My...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} cold-formed high strength stainless <b>steel</b> <b>square</b> and rectangular hollow sections in compression {{has been presented}} in this paper. A non-linear finite element model that includes geometric and material non-linearities was developed and verified against experimental results. The model was then used for an extensive parametric study to investigate the interaction effects of constituent plate elements on Class 3 slenderness limit and section capacities of cold-formed high strength stainless <b>steel</b> <b>square</b> and rectangular hollow sections in compression. It is shown that the interaction effects of constituent plate elements on cross-section response are quite obvious particularly for slender sections. The design provisions on Class 3 slenderness limit in the EC 3 Code and proposed by Gardner and Theofanous are suitable for square hollow sections, but not for rectangular hollow sections since they do not take into consideration of interaction effects of constituent plate element. Therefore, a new Class 3 slenderness limit is proposed in this study, which carefully considers the interaction effects of the constituent plate elements...|$|E
