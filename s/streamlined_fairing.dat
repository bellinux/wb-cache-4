25|$|High-altitude {{interceptor}} fighter prototype. Armed {{with three}} 20mm cannon and two 12.7mm (0.5in) machine guns. The machine gun bulges {{were replaced by}} a <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing.</b>|$|E
25|$|A spinner is an {{aircraft}} component, a <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing</b> fitted over a propeller hub {{or at the}} centre of a turbofan engine. Spinners both make the aircraft overall more streamlined, reducing aerodynamic drag and also smooth the airflow so that it enters the air intakes more efficiently. Spinners also fulfill an aesthetic role on some aircraft designs.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} was made to introduce a series of other minor improvements to produce the Whitley Mk V. These included the modification of the tail fins and rudders, the fitting of leading edge de-icers, further fuel capacity increases, a smaller D/F loop in a <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing</b> being adopted, and the extension of the rear fuselage by 15in (381mm) to improve the rear-gunner's field of fire. The Whitley Mk V was by far the most numerous version of the aircraft, with 1,466 built until production ended in June 1943.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 the {{bodywork}} was {{revised to}} include a horizontally-split headlamp, a more <b>streamlined</b> upper <b>fairing,</b> and a reduced tail 'hump'. The frame was also painted black instead of the silver of all previous models. The fuel-injection system was changed from a bypass-regulated-rail to a returnless-rail system.|$|R
50|$|The Deltacraft MD-40 was {{designed}} {{to comply with the}} Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight category, including the category's maximum gross weight of 450 kg. The aircraft has a maximum gross weight of 340 kg. It features a cable-braced hang glider-style high-wing, weight-shift controls, a single seat open cockpit with a <b>streamlined</b> cockpit <b>fairing,</b> retractable tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration.|$|R
50|$|Depth charges {{could also}} be dropped from an attacking {{aircraft}} against submarines. At the start of World War II, Britain's aerial anti-submarine weapon was the 100 lb anti-submarine bomb. This weapon was too light and ultimately, a failure. Indeed, on 5 September 1939, a Royal Air Force Avro Anson of No. 233 Squadron was destroyed when its own anti-submarine bomb skipped off {{the surface of the}} water and detonated under the aircraft. To remedy the failure of this weapon, the Royal Navy's 450 lb Mark VII depth charge was modified for aerial use by the addition of a <b>streamlined</b> nose <b>fairing</b> and stabilising fins on the tail.|$|R
25|$|All {{previous}} night fighter {{versions of the}} Ju 88 used a modified A-series fuselage. The G-series fuselage was purpose-built for {{the special needs of}} a night fighter, with the A-series' Bola ventral under-nose defensive gun position omitted for lower aerodynamic drag and less weight, and adding the enlarged squared-off vertical fin/rudder tail unit of the Ju 188. G-1 aircraft possessed more powerful armament and like the earlier R-1, used a pair of 1,700PS BMW 801 radial engines, the G-1 using the later BMW 801G-2 version. Electronic equipment consisted of the then-standard FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 90MHz VHF radar using eight-dipole Hirschgeweih antennas, which could include fitment of the borderline-SHF-band FuG 350 Naxos radar detector with its receiving antenna housed in a teardrop-shaped <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing</b> above the canopy, or FuG 227 Flensburg radar detector homing devices that had their own trio of twin-dipole antennae: one on each wing leading edge and one under the tail. One Ju 88G-1 of 7. Staffel/NJG 2 was flown by mistake to RAF Woodbridge in July 1944, giving the Royal Air Force its first chance to check out the VHF-band Lichtenstein SN-2 radar and Flensburg radar detector gear.|$|E
500|$|The forward {{portion of}} the {{fuselage}} was redesigned with an airliner-style stepped windscreen and the fuselage was lengthened by almost [...] which allowed the bomb bays and their doors to be lengthened. The radar and its operator were moved into the forward pressurized compartment and the radar itself was located in the [...] "chin" [...] position in a new <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing.</b> The wings were enlarged {{to a total of}} [...] and the rubber deicing boots were replaced by more efficient and aerodynamic bleed air deicers. The engine nacelles were redesigned with smaller cross-sections with less drag. Originally, Shvetsov ASh-2TK or Dobrynin VD-3TK engines were considered, but neither engine was ready so the Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN was used. Fully feathering propellers were also used. All of these changes increased the lift/drag ratio to 18 from the 17.0 of the Tu-4.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{original}} primary training versions (designated У – [...] "U") featured wings of constant chord, subsequent variants designed for soaring flight (designated П – [...] "P") had longer-span wings with tapering outer panels and a streamlined nose fairing. The ultimate {{development in the}} line were gliders intended for towed flight (designated Б – [...] "B"), which shared the longer wings and <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing</b> of the P-types, but added a canopy to enclose the cockpit.|$|E
50|$|Efforts to {{increase}} the DA40's cruising speed centered on the propeller and wheel spats. The wheel <b>fairing</b> <b>streamlining</b> was improved, a three-blade scimitar-type constant speed propeller was incorporated and the Powerflow exhaust system from the XL was retained. The canopy contour was also revised, with the sides being more vertical before curving into the roof, which provides more shoulder and head room.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} square tubing, with its wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its [...] span wing {{is supported by a}} single tube-type kingpost and uses an [...] "A" [...] frame control bar. The occupants are housed in <b>streamlined</b> fibreglass cockpit <b>fairing.</b> Engines available include the twin cylinder, two-stroke, liquid-cooled [...] Rotax 582 and the four cylinder four-stroke [...] Rotax 912UL and [...] 912ULS. Engine mounts for BMW and Subaru engines are also available. Available wings to be mated to the carriage are the Aeros Profi, Aeros Stranger, Aeros Stream and Aeros Still. The wing-mounting pylon is foldable, allowing the wing to be installed by one person. Floats and ski landing gear are optional.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{housed the}} main armament and the Alfa Romeo RA.1000 R.C.41-I Monsone engine which drove a Piaggio P1001 three-blade, variable-pitch, constant speed propeller. Situated behind {{the engine and}} under the 12.7 mm (.5 in) ammunition boxes there was a 270 L (71.3 US gal) self-sealing fuel tank. Another 80 L (21.1 US gal) fuel tank was placed behind the pilot, with two additional tanks, each with a capacity of 40 L (10.5 US gal), being housed in the wing roots; the total fuel capacity was 430 L (113.6 US gal) [...] The main coolant radiator was housed in a rectangular fairing under the fuselage beneath the cockpit, and the oil cooler was placed under the nose within a streamlined, rectangular housing. From the cockpit aft, the fuselage was formed into a round monocoque structure; the aft fuselage tapered into the tail and contained the radio, oxygen and flight control mechanisms. The canopy was hinged on the starboard base and opened sideways. Behind the canopy the pilot's headrest was fixed to a triangular turn-over pylon which was covered by a <b>streamlined,</b> tapered <b>fairing.</b> This fairing was shaped into an inverted 'T' which enabled the pilot to have a reasonable field of view to the rear. The unpressurised cockpit had an armor plate fitted behind the armored seat for protection. While early C.202s had a very short [...] "stub" [...] radio mast projecting from the fairing, most used a tall, slim mast.|$|R
2500|$|The {{carburettor}} {{air intake}} on early to mid-production Spitfire IXs {{was a different}} shape from those of single-stage engined aircraft; they were shorter and had a wider air inlet. From 1943, an [...] "Aero-Vee" [...] tropical filter in a long, <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing</b> was introduced for the carburettor air intake. This was fitted as standard to all Mk VIIs, VIIIs, PR Mk Xs and Mk XVIs, on mid to late production Mk IXs, and to most PR Mk XIs.|$|E
2500|$|Designed by John Monnett, who {{coined the}} term [...] "Air Recreation Vehicle" [...] to {{describe}} it, it is a single-seat motorglider with a low, cantilever wing and a V-tail. Construction is of metal throughout, and {{it is intended to}} be easy and inexpensive to build and fly. [...] Like many sailplanes, the main undercarriage is a single monowheel, which in this case was mounted in a <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing</b> beneath the fuselage and is not retractable, with a steerable tailwheel behind it. Builders are also given the option of constructing their example with fixed tricycle undercarriage. Power is provided by a small two-cylinder, horizontally opposed, air-cooled engine.|$|E
2500|$|Like a fixed wing aircraft, the A-4 was {{controlled}} with ailerons and elevators {{connected to a}} control column and the rudder to pedals. To the pilot's right there was a lever which enabled the rotor {{to be connected to}} the engine via reducing gears for jump starts and to ease heavy landings. The drive shaft followed the single forward rotor pylon strut, enclosed within a <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing.</b> [...] The A-4's fixed undercarriage had wheels on pairs of hinged V struts from the lower fuselage longerons with vertical legs, fitted with faired rubber shock absorbers, to the forward wing spar immediately below the wing strut. The tailskid also included a shock absorber.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to develop a Human Resource e-Leave Management System for the {{university}} that will be more efficient and synchronized than the current manual system. In order to have an efficient and effective management of leave transactions, the web-based system was designed and implemented with modules on leave applications, leave balances monitoring, records management, administration, and install the business intelligence technique to aid in the decision making activities of the HRDM Officer and the Management. It offers <b>streamlined</b> operations, <b>fair</b> application of leave policies, introduction of more statistical reports and a more productive workforce. The development methods used were Process Modeling and UML diagrams. The tools and languages used in developing the system were Ajax, Adobe Flash and Flash Player, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML 5 and CSS 3 for the client-side coding and PHP for the server-side coding. MySQL was used for the database and XAMPP as the web server. The development environment was Eclipse Web Tools Platform, and the development framework was CodeIgniter. Structured questionnaires were used to conduct the Preliminary Survey, System Usability and Web Usability Evaluation. The main findings of this study revealed that the system is fully compliant with the standard System Usability Guidelines. Likewise, the Web Usability showed that the employees strongly agreed on the implementation of the system in order to have a quick response and access to information. The results of the Web Accessibility test also showed that the completed system is error-free and passed the standard guidelines for Web Accessibility...|$|R
40|$|Assessment in {{the arts}} can be challenging. The {{problems}} associated with assessing student performances are that judgements are complex {{and even more so}} when they involve multiple markers (Campbell, 2005). It can be difficult to ensure assessment is fair, valid and reliable and that students are provided with clear feedback that is meaningful to them. This paper describes the development and trialling of an innovative, technology supported tool, designed to improve the confidence, efficiency and effectiveness of student performance-based assessment in arts education. This project {{is a work in progress}} and early trials of the Internet based digital computer technology tool suggest that it reduces tutor anxiety, increases markers’ confidence, improves the management of assessment and record keeping, facilitates easy and quick moderation, and provides explicit feedback to students to enhance ongoing learning. The perception by stakeholders is that this assessment is far more accessible and easy to use than previous methods. The project was implemented in a Bachelor of Education course, with 170 third year pre-service teacher students. Group performances were assessed by three tutors simultaneously during the live performance and for one week afterwards by viewing online video recordings of each performance. The tutors were able to discuss the assessment online via a confidential ‘tutor box’ attached to the marking key and only visible to tutors. The assessment was presented to the students as a one page electronic marking key with the video of their performance embedded into this page. This was saved as a pdf document and emailed to students. The students’ responses have been overwhelmingly positive. They reported that ease of access to this electronic assessment meant that they engaged with their feedback multiple times. The tutors reported that the process was far more <b>streamlined</b> and <b>fair...</b>|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on a one-tenth scale model of a conventional tractor trailer livestock hauler to determine the air flow through the trailer and the drag of the vehicle. These {{tests were conducted}} with the trailer empty and with a full load of simulated cattle. Additionally, the drag was determined for six configurations, of which details for three are documented herein. These are: (1) conventional livestock trailer empty, (2) conventional trailer with smooth sides (i. e., without ventilation openings), and (3) a stream line tractor with modified livestock trailer (cab <b>streamlining</b> and gap <b>fairing).</b> The internal flow of the streamlined modification with simulated cattle was determined with two different ducting systems: a ram air inlet over the cab and NACA submerged inlets between the cab and trailer. The air flow within the conventional trailer was random and variable. The streamline vehicle with ram air inlet provided a nearly uniform air flow which could be controlled. The streamline vehicle with NACA submerged inlets provided better flow conditions than the conventional livestock trailer but not as uniform or controllable as the ram inlet configuration...|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{centre section}} contained the [...] "engine room" [...] with its two 450hp (336kW) Napier Lions in tandem. [...] One was ahead of the wing leading edge and the other at the wing centreline, with an enclosed, illuminated space between them where the engineer could stand upright and monitor and manage them. [...] The engines were mounted on the upper fuselage longerons, leaving a crawl space beneath. [...] The Lions were oriented with their gearboxes away from the engineer's room and the power from each {{was taken to the}} airscrews by two drive shafts at right angles to the fuselage. [...] The two from the front engine drove a pair of two-bladed tractor propellers ahead of the leading edge via a pair of gearboxes half way between the wings, just beyond the first interplane struts. Their mountings extended rearwards to carry a similarly driven pair of four-bladed pusher propellers driven by the rear engine. [...] Port and starboard airscrews rotated in opposite directions and the fore and aft pairs did likewise, so that either engine could be shut down without any power asymmetry. [...] The centre section, engine drive shafts and propeller mountings were built as a unit independent of the wings, the drives having their own struts and bracing. [...] The space between each fore and aft pair of propellers was occupied by a cylindrical petrol tank, and thin radiators extended between these tanks and the fuselage. [...] Radiators and driveshafts were enclosed by a <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing</b> on either side.|$|E

5000|$|First {{conceived}} {{in the latter}} half of 1939, the D-series of Bf 110s was targeted to have improvements meant to increase its range. The initial D-series version, the Bf 110D-0 was designed to add a large, streamlined 1,050 litre (277 U.S. gallon) ventral fuel tank built under the fuselage, which required a substantially sized, conformal <b>streamlined</b> ventral fuselage <b>fairing</b> extending from halfway back under the nose to the rear of the cockpit glazing, inspiring the nickname Dackelbauch (dachshund's belly). The D-1 was also set up to accept a pair of fin-equipped 900 litre (238 U.S. gallon) drop tanks, one under each wing, increasing the total fuel capacity to 4,120 litres (1,088 U.S. gallons). The substantial added drag of the early [...] "dachshund's belly" [...] ventral fuselage tank in test flights mandated its omission from production D-1s although they were still prepared to mount an improved, better streamlined, version. D-1s so equipped were known as D-1/R1 whereas the D-1/R2 was equipped with two 900 l drop tanks and a droppable 85 l oil tank. Later D-2 and D-3 versions retained the twin underwing 900 litre drop tank capability, using multipurpose ordnance racks capable of holding either drop tanks or carrying bombs.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{features a}} carriage {{built on a}} welded stainless steel frame, with a fiberglass composite <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing,</b> dual-controls, a two-seats-in-tandem, open cockpit, tricycle landing gear with wheel pants and a single engine in pusher configuration. The rotor is of aluminum alloy and includes a pneumatic pre-rotator.|$|E
50|$|Its {{retractable}} undercarriage was conventional {{and had a}} track of 3.0 m. The mainwheels, which were fitted with hydraulic brakes and mounted on single shock absorber legs, were electrically retracted rearwards into the engine nacelles. The tailwheel was steerable and was enclosed in a <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The machine set {{a number}} of race records, {{including}} the first lap over 100 mph at a major event, when Georg Meier won the Belgian motorcycle Grand Prix in 1939, and Ernst Jakob Henne's capture of the motorcycle land-speed record in 1936 on a model with a <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{large portion}} of {{responsibility}} for the encountered temperature issue was judged to have been a product of greater than expected drag resulting from the underwing radiators, which exhausted across the upper wing surface and were relatively inefficient; this arrangement was replaced with a single radiator unit housed under the fuselage in a <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing.</b> Other aerodynamic improvements were made around this time, such as the minor enlargement of the fin and rudder, for greater lateral stability.|$|E

It was designed to carry four passengers over long distances. Wood was used both in the structure and skin of the whole aircraft, which had low, cantilever wings and a flat sided fuselage containing the passenger cabin, located over the wing and lit by three square windows. The pilot's open cockpit was further aft, {{on top of the}} fuselage in a <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing.</b> The fin had a straight, swept leading edge and a squared-off top, with a deep, almost rectangular rudder moving in a cut-out between the elevators; the latter were mounted, with the tailplane, on top of the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The {{horizontal}} tail {{was mounted}} {{on top of}} the fuselage, braced from the lower fuselage longerons on each side with a pair of parallel struts. Its plan was similar to the wing and the elevators were split, with a cut-out for the deep, broad rudder. The tailplane angle of incidence could be trimmed in flight. The low area fin was broad but unusually low; its angle of incidence could only be adjusted on the ground. The H.28 had conventional, fixed, tailskid landing gear. Its mainwheels, half enclosed by individual semi-circular fairings, were on a single axle and rubber cord shock absorbers enclosed within a <b>streamlined</b> <b>fairing</b> mounted on the lower fuselage longerons by N-form struts and reinforced by the wing bracing struts.
