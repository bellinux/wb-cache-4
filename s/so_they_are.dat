5|$|According to Keller's conjecture, any tiling of {{the plane}} by {{congruent}} squares must include two squares that meet edge-to-edge. None of the squares in the Pythagorean tiling meet edge-to-edge, but this fact does not violate Keller's conjecture because the tiles have different sizes, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not all congruent to each other.|$|E
5|$|Although Shetlands {{are small}} and slow-growing {{compared}} to commercial breeds, they are hardy, thrifty, easy lambers, adaptable and long-lived. The Shetland breed has survived for centuries in difficult conditions and on a poor diet, but they thrive in better conditions. Shetlands retain many of their primitive survival instincts, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> easier to care for than many modern breeds.|$|E
5|$|Deformed matrices, {{consisting}} of randomly oriented nanochannels in a spongelike keratin matrix, create the diffuse non-iridescent blue colour of Ara ararauna, the blue-and-yellow macaw. Since the reflections {{are not all}} arranged in the same direction, the colours, while still magnificent, do not vary much with angle, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not iridescent.|$|E

5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} {{tests and}} adenosine deaminase testing may allow rapid diagnosis of TB. These tests, however, are not routinely recommended, as they rarely alter {{how a person}} is treated. Blood tests to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Reads do {{not require}} an erase of the flash memory, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not {{generally}} associated with write amplification. In the limited chance of a read disturb error, the data in that block is read and rewritten, but this would not have any material impact on the write amplification of the drive.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{allowed the}} {{creation}} of Accountable Care Organizations(ACOs), which are groups of doctors, hospitals and other providers that commit to give coordinated, high qualitycareto Medicare patients. ACOs were allowed to continue using a fee for service billing approach. They receive bonus payments from the government for minimizing costs while achieving quality benchmarks that emphasize prevention and mitigation of chronic disease.If they fail to do <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> subject to penalties.|$|E

5|$|Athletes will {{sometimes}} become citizens {{of a different}} nation <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> able {{to compete in the}} Olympics. This is often because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States. It could also be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete's home country. Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.|$|E
5|$|Each pupil is {{assigned}} to one of the six houses upon joining the school, and a pupil's house can be indicated to others by optional colour-related clothing. If someone joins as the second in their direct family to do <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> put in the same house as their relative. There are inter-house competitions throughout the year (including rugby, hockey, reading, and chess) and then {{at the end of the}} year the points awarded in each event throughout the year are added up, and the house with most points is awarded the Cock House Cup, which is the traditional name given in British public schools for the in-school competition cup.|$|E
5|$|Harrya chromapes, {{commonly}} known as the yellowfoot bolete or the chrome-footed bolete, is species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is found in eastern North America, Costa Rica, and eastern Asia, where it grows on the ground, in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous and coniferous trees. Fruit bodies have smooth, rose-pink caps that are initially convex before flattening out. The pores on the cap undersurface are white, aging to a pale pink as the spores mature. The thick stipe has fine pink or reddish dots (scabers), and is white to pinkish but with a bright yellow base. The mushrooms are edible but are popular with insects, and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often infested with maggots.|$|E

5|$|In the novel, Calafia is a pagan who is {{convinced}} to raise {{an army of}} women warriors and sail away from California with a large flock of trained griffins {{so that she can}} join a Muslim battle against Christians who are defending Constantinople. In the siege, the griffins harm enemy and friendly forces, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> withdrawn. Calafia and her ally Radiaro fight in single combat against the Christian leaders, a king and his son the knight Esplandián. Calafia is bested and taken prisoner, and she converts to Christianity. She marries a cousin of Esplandián and returns with her army to California for further adventures.|$|E
5|$|Liquids can {{interact}} with two main types of solid surfaces. Traditionally, solid surfaces have been divided into high-energy solids and low-energy types. The relative {{energy of a}} solid {{has to do with}} the bulk nature of the solid itself. Solids such as metals, glasses, and ceramics are known as 'hard solids' because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively large amount of energy is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high surface energy), <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E

5|$|Once fusion begins, the {{temperature}} of the white dwarf increases. A main sequence star supported by thermal pressure can expand and cool which automatically regulates the increase in thermal energy. However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> vulnerable to runaway fusion reactions. The flare accelerates dramatically, in part due to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and interactions with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable debate whether this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic deflagration.|$|E
5|$|Other {{drugs such}} as {{amantadine}} and anticholinergics may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not first choice treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD {{is accompanied by a}} diverse range of symptoms. A number of drugs have been used to treat some of these problems. Examples are the use of quetiapine for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia, and modafinil for daytime sleepiness.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E

5|$|The Swiss {{climate is}} {{generally}} temperate, but can vary greatly between the localities, from glacial {{conditions on the}} mountaintops to the often pleasant near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. There are some valley areas {{in the southern part}} of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> ideal for pastures and grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion, during these periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks.|$|E
5|$|The game follows Cocoro Fuyukawa and Satoru Yukidoh, who {{frequently}} experience {{a phenomenon that}} makes their minds switch place with each other, putting them in the other person's body. Cocoro is stuck in a blizzard in an emergency cabin on a mountain together with three other people, while Satoru is in an institute {{for the treatment of}} mentally ill criminals, having lost his memory. The player takes the role of Cocoro, and reads the story while occasionally making choices that affect the course of the story, attempting to keep her alive for seven days; after doing <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> able to play through the seven days from Satoru's perspective as well.|$|E
5|$|A spine is a sharp, {{needle-like}} structure used {{to inflict}} pain on predators. An {{example of this}} seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the tip, and are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the body, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E
