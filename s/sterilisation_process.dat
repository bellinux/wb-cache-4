In 1953, the company operated seven days a week, twenty {{four hours a day}} on a shift system. A continuous <b>sterilisation</b> <b>process</b> was introduced instead of batch processing. New dog food brands Pal and Lassie were introduced during the 1950s. Due to making more than the Chappie product, the company name changed to Petfoods Ltd in 1956. In 1972, this became Pedigree Petfoods Ltd. A new factory on Shrewsbury Avenue in Woodston, Peterborough opened in October 1974 which originally produced semi-moist products such as Bounce. In March 1975 it became the Pedigree Petfoods division of Mars Ltd. During the 1970s, around 2,500 workers were at Melton and 200 at Peterborough and produced around 400,000 tonnes of animal food a year and virtually doubled production. The raw materials came from the Oakleigh Manufacturing company in Ascot. Around 3 million cans were used per day at the Melton plant; cans were delivered every 30 minutes, to limit storage space, from the Metal Box company (which became Novar plc). At this time, Whiskas was the company's biggest product by sales closely followed by Pedigree Chum, although more in volume was sold of Pedigree Chum. Whiskas sold four times as much as Kitekat, although only half as much was spent on advertising Kitekat as Whiskas.|$|E

To ensure stability of manufactured foods, generally worst case scenarios are applied often leading to unwanted over processing of foods. This means bigger requirements {{of energy and}} larger emissions of CO 2 into the atmosphere. A heat-resistant spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus sporothermodurans, was tested {{for its ability to}} produce consistently highly heat-resistant spore crops to be used to more precisely determine the minimal thermal process that is compatible with microbial stability, thus avoiding the indicated overprocessing. Isothermal survival curves of B. sporothermodurans IC 4 spores were determined in distilled water at temperatures up to 125 °C using the capillary tube technique and a thermoresistometer Mastia. B. sporothermodurans consistently produced crops of heat-resistant spores with kmax values at 121 °C up to 0. 46 min− 1. After consecutive sporulation cycles, the measured heat resistance of B. sporothermodurans was not reduced. Survival curves showed shoulders that were characterized by means of existing models (Geeraerd, Weibull) that were compared with the classical, log-linear one. Shoulders are a common phenomenon in heat-resistant spore-forming bacteria and {{may be related to the}} need of more stringent processing conditions.

Besides the contact time of the test specimens with gaseous H 2 O 2 varied between 0. 2 and 0. 5 s, the present H 2 O 2 concentration in a range from 0 to 8 % v/v (volume percent) had a strong influence on the microbicidal effectiveness, whereas the change of the vaporiser temperature, gas flow and humidity were almost negligible.

Thermally sensitive foils with thickness of few tens of µm may require efficient and environmentally friendly <b>sterilisation</b> <b>processes</b> which work with web speeds up to several meters per second. UV-emitting plasmas at atmospheric pressure generated in dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) show low working temperature of the plasma gas and can therefore be used for treatment of polymeric materials.

The lower gap provides direct plasma exposure to the packaging foil and may be flowed by reactive or oxidative plasma gases. The efficient excimer UV source is emitting narrow-band UV light near to the packaging which results in high angles of incidence of the light.

40|$|Abstract: Reliability and {{durability}} assurance poses {{a serious challenge}} for surgical instruments manufacturers. Hard working conditions, such as intermittent contact with body fluids and hard bone tissues, as well as necessity to undergo frequent <b>sterilisation</b> <b>processes,</b> induce constant research into solutions capable of ensuring high wear resistance while maintaining satisfactory imperviousness to corrosion. Plasma nitriding is marked as the modern corrosion resistance improving method suitable for surgical instruments steels. The paper pre-sents findings from the heat treated and plasma nitrided AISI 440 B (PN EN or DIN X 90 CrMoV 18) steel corrosion resistance studies. Three conventionally heat treated (quenched with tempering in 250, 390 or 605 °C) and three additionally plasma nitrided in N 2 :H 2 reaction gas mixture (50 : 50, 35 : 65 and 20 : 80 ratio, respectively) specimens groups were examined.

Results showed that, in comparison to conventional heat treatment, plasma nitriding of 440 B stainless steel does not significantly affect its corrosive characteristics as far as the uniform nitride layer over the entire detail surface is obtained.

However, surface wear of the polyethylene leading to osteolysis {{is still considered}} the longer-term risk factor. Experimental wear simulation is an established method for evaluating the wear performance of total joint replacements. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of simulation input conditions, specifically input kinematic magnitudes, waveforms and directions of motion and position of the femoral centre of rotation, on the wear performance of a fixed-bearing total knee replacement through a combined experimental and computational approach. Studies were completed using conventional and moderately cross-linked polyethylene to determine whether the influence of these simulation input conditions varied with material. The position of the femoral centre of rotation and the input kinematics were shown to have a significant influence on the wear rates. Similar trends were shown for both the conventional and moderately cross-linked polyethylene materials, although lower wear rates were found for the moderately cross-linked polyethylene due to the higher level of cross-linking. The most important factor influencing the wear was the position of the relative contact point at the femoral component and tibial insert interface. This was dependent on the combination of input displacement magnitudes, waveforms, direction of motion and femoral centre of rotation. This study provides further evidence that in order to study variables such as design and material in total knee replacement, it is important to carefully control knee simulation conditions.

Design/methodology/approach: A surface roughness diversification of the samples made of Ti alloys was obtained with the aid of mechanical working – grinding and with the use of mechanical polishing. A corrosion resistance test was performed based on an anodic polarization curves recording. An Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) method was used as well for assessment of the effects which occur {{on the surface of the}} examined alloys. Findings: The potentiodynamic studies showed favourable influence of steam <b>sterilisation</b> <b>process</b> (in an autoclave) on corrosion resistance of Ti alloys, regardless of the applied mechanical treatment. Exposition of the samples in Ringer’ solution caused further increase of corrosion resistance only for Ti- 6 Al- 7 Nb alloy. Analysis of impedance spectra showed presence of the capacitive passive layer for all tested variants. Research limitations/implications: Obtained results of potentiodynamic studies showed how a physicochemical condition of the samples surface, exposed to the solution simulating osseous system environment, was changing. In order to determine properties fully and surface structures of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and Ti- 6 Al- 7 Nb alloys after the sterilisation and the 60 -day exposure to Ringer’ solution, impedance characteristics, obtained by means of EIS were determined. Differences of parameters describing electrical properties of the layers formed after the exposure to Ringer’ solution, are probably caused by a change of their chemical composition.

Local processing company Tropico Fruits produces an extensive range of fruit based products and list an Australian Kensington Pride mango puree among their flagship products. In light of the recent health issues arising from composite products using imported ingredients, the ability to test a processed product and identify the country of origin of it constituents is of great value to commercial enterprises that promote their products as locally sourced. Processed mango products are great candidates for assessing the feasibility of applying DNA-based identification methodologies for a number of reasons. DNA profiles have been determined for over 300 mango accession sourced from around the globe, including all the major domestic and overseas commercial varieties. Within all the commercial varieties, unique combinations of DNA markers exist such that a specific DNA profile {{can be traced back to}} the source variety. This means that even in composite purees, the major constituent varieties would be detected. To this end, four commercially produced mango purees were provided by Tropico Fruits and samples were subjected to a number of DNA extraction methodologies.

40|$|Aseptic-Ultra-High-Temperature (UHT) {{products}} are manufactured {{to be free}} of microorganisms capable of growing in the food at normal non-refrigerated conditions at which the food is likely to be held during manufacture, distribution and storage. Two important phases within the process are widely recognised as critical in controlling microbial contamination: the sterilisation steps and the following aseptic steps. Of the microbial hazards, the pathogen spore formers Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus cereus are deemed the most pertinent to be controlled. In addition, due to a relatively high thermal resistance, Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores are considered a concern for spoilage of low acid aseptic-UHT products. A probabilistic exposure assessment model has been developed in order to assess the aseptic-UHT product failure rate associated with these three bacteria. It was a Modular Process Risk Model, based on nine modules. They described: i) the microbial contamination introduced by the raw materials, either from the product (i. e. milk, cocoa and dextrose powders and water) or the packaging (i. e. bottle and sealing component), ii) the <b>sterilisation</b> <b>processes,</b> of either the product or the packaging material, iii) the possible recontamination during subsequent processing of both product and packaging. The Sterility Failure Rate (SFR) was defined as the sum of bottles contaminated for each batch, divided {{by the total number of}} bottles produced per process line run (10 (6) batches simulated per process line). The SFR associated with the three bacteria was estimated at the last step of the process (i. e. after Module 9) but also after each module, allowing for the identification of modules, and responsible contamination pathways, with higher or lower intermediate SFR. The model contained 42 controlled settings associated with factory environment, process line or product formulation, and more than 55 probabilistic inputs corresponding to inputs with variability conditional to a mean uncertainty. It was developed in @Risk and run through Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, the highest SFR was associated with G. stearothermophilus (380000 bottles contaminated in 10 (11) bottles produced) and the lowest to C. botulinum (3 bottles contaminated in 10 (11) bottles produced). Unsurprisingly, SFR due to G. stearothermophilus was due to its ability to survive the UHT treatment. More interestingly, it was identified that SFR due to B. cereus (17000 bottles contaminated in 10 (11) bottles produced) was due to an airborne recontamination of the aseptic tank (49 %) and a post-sterilisation packaging contamination (33 %). A deeper analysis (sensitivity and scenario analyses) was done to investigate how the SFR due to B. cereus could be reduced by changing the process settings related to potential air recontamination source...|$|R

Response Surface Methodology (RSM) approach was applied, based on the interrelation between process temperature (X₁; 100 to 120 °C), time (X₂; 20 to 80 min), and CPO quality parameters (Y₁, Free Fatty Acid (FFA); Y₂, Peroxide Value (PV); Y₃, Deterioration of Bleachability Index (DOBI); and Y₄, carotene content). FFA was recorded increases as theFFB ripen. Though there was no apparent PV difference noticed at underripe, ripe and overripe FFB, substantial increment was recorded on loose fruits. No specific patterns observed for both DOBl and carotene content. Sixteen polynomial models were developed with models' significance at p< 0. 05 and R² approximating 1. There was a strong effect of temperature on FFA, as X₁, were found highly significant at all degree of ripeness. Process time was found more pronounced influencing the PV from underripe and ripe FFB and the role was dominated by temperature as the maturity increases. Stronger effect of time recorded on DOBI, with p< 0. 0001 (underripe, ripe and overripe FFB) and p= 0. 0077 (loose fruits). For carotene content, both temperature and time were mutually responsible on carotene destruction at any degree of ripeness. Optimum sterilisation conditions were determined and verified. Both underripe and ripe FFB show potential for extracting Premium Quality CPO at 100 °c and 20 min while overripe FFB is suitable for extraction of Special Quality CPO at 111. 3 °C and 36. 52 min. Palm oil producers should consider for segregating the FFB according to ripeness, instead of simply mixing up the received crop for processing. The extraction of high quality CPO from different degree of FFB ripeness is feasible {{as long as the}} right combination of <b>sterilisation</b> <b>process</b> heating parameters employed...|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} of the mechanical properties was employed as the principal yardstick to quantify the physical attributes of oil palm fruitlet components before and after being subjected to thermal treatment process. Two industrial-scale thermal treatment methods were considered; horizontal sterilisation (being the most common) and vertical sterilisation (recently implemented). The exocarp and mesocarp layers of thermally-treated fruitlets, as attested by texture profile analysis, compression test, and tensile test, have a significantly low value of fracturability, hardness, firmness, and strength as opposed to untreated fruitlets. Micrographs of the mesocarp slices have provided plausible explanation for the observed decline in the mechanical properties of the sterilised fruitlets. The oil which was initially contained within the fruitlets tends to leach out during the <b>sterilisation</b> <b>process</b> due to the resulting structural disintegration within the layers of the fruitlets. On another related enquiry, the required cracking force to break palm nuts in order to extract the kernel {{was found to be}} influenced by the moisture content...|$|E
40|$|Sterilisation {{processes}} are compulsory in medicine, pharmacy, and food industries to prevent infections of consumers and microbiological contaminations of products. Monitoring the sterilisation by conventional microbiological methods is time- and lab-consuming. To overcome this problem, {{in this work}} a novel biosensor has been proposed. The sensor enables a fast method to evaluate sterilisation processes. By means of thin-film technology the sensor's transducer structures in form of IDEs (interdigitated electrodes) have been fabricated on a silicon substrate. Physical characterisation of the developed sensor was done by AFM, SEM, and profilometry. Impedance analyses were conducted for the electrical characterisation. As microbiological layer spores of B. atrophaeus have been immobilised on the sensing structure; spores of this type are a well-known sterilisation test organism. Impedance measurements at a fixed frequency over time were performed to monitor the immobilisation process. A <b>sterilisation</b> <b>process</b> according to aseptic filling machines was applied to demonstrate the sensor functionality. After both, immobilisation and sterilisation, a change in impedance could successfully be detected...|$|E
40|$|Prions {{are highly}} {{resistant}} to common proteases and conventional <b>sterilisation</b> <b>processes.</b> Consequently, prion infectivity is destroyed by {{methods such as}} incineration, alkaline and thermal hydrolysis. These harsh, destructive and potentially hazardous methods are unsuitable for processing specified risk materials (SRM) and animal by-products, and in the decontamination of medical and laboratory devices, and prion contaminated environments. Thus an environmentally friendly, enzymatic degradation and decontamination process is a highly desirable alternative. The structural similarity of prion and feather keratin suggests that feather degrading microorganisms {{have the potential to}} degrade prions. The objective of this research was to isolate and characterise microbial keratinase and to investigate its ability to degrade ME 7 scrapie prion. Thirty two microbial strains were isolated on feather meal agar from primary effluent and farmyard wastes. One of the isolates, a Grams positive bacterium, demonstrated ignificant keratinolytic activity (11. 00 ± 0. 71 U/ml), and was investigated further. The isolate was identified by 16 S rDNA and designated as Bacillus licheniformis N 22, and was deposited in National Collection of Industrial Food and Marine Bacteria (NCIMB). The growth conditions for optimum keratinase synthesis in a minimal growth medium (MGM) were found to be pH 8. 5, 50 °C, 1. 1 % (w/v) feather meal substrate and at incubation time of 32 h. The molecular weight of purified keratinase was � 28 KDa as measured by SDS-PAGE and confirmed by MALDITOF-MS. Optimum keratinase activity was obtained at pH 8. 5 and 50 °C. This keratinase fully degraded recalcitrant melanised feather in 48 h, and also digested ME 7 scrapie prion at 65 °C in 2 h to levels of PrPSc undetectable by western blot analysis. In a remarkable synergistic enzymatic preparation composed of keratinase and biosurfactant derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCIMB 8626, ME 7 scrapie prion was degraded to undetectable levels at 65 °C in 10 min. Interestingly biosurfactant alone showed no detectable activity on ME 7 scrapie prion. Time-course degradation analysis showed progressive attenuation of PrPSc signal at 50 °C over time. Test of residual infectivity by standard cell culture assay showed that this enzymatic method completely destroyed standard sheep scrapie prion (SSBP/ 1) at 65 °C in 1 h. The mean survival time of mice challenged with enzyme- digested inocula significantly increased from 278 ± 9 days to 334 ± 42 days compared to those inoculated intraperitoneally with neat ME 7 scrapie (p = 0. 008 at 95 % confidence interval). Furthermore, 47 % of all the mice in enzyme-digested group lacked detectable levels of PrPSc. These results suggest a substantial reduction in the infectious titre or complete destruction of ME 7 prion infectivity by the enzymatic preparation. Therefore, this mild enzymatic treatment method has potential applications for prion decontamination. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{describes}} a novel multiple sensor-type {{system for the}} real-time analysis of aseptic sterilisation processes employing gaseous hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) as a sterilant. The inactivation kinetics of Bacillus atrophaeus by gaseous H 2 O 2 have been investigated {{by means of a}} methodical calibration experiment, taking into account the process variables H 2 O 2 concentration, humidity and gas temperature. It has been found that the microbicidal effectiveness at H 2 O 2 concentrations above 2 % v/v is largely determined by the concentration itself, while at lower H 2 O 2 concentrations, the gas temperature and humidity play a leading role. Furthermore, the responses of different types of gas sensors towards the influencing factors of the <b>sterilisation</b> <b>process</b> have been analysed within the same experiment. Based on a correlation established between the inactivation kinetics and the sensor responses, a calorimetric H 2 O 2 sensor and a metal-oxide semiconductor (MOX) sensor have been identified as possible candidates for monitoring the microbicidal effectiveness of aseptic sterilisation processes employing gaseous H 2 O 2. Therefore, two linear models that describe the relationship between sensor response and microbicidal effectiveness have been proposed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{intended}} to verify, through microbiological techniques and TEM investigations, {{the killing of}} bacterial spores after treatment in steam autoclave, and to propose strictly morphological considerations about the target of this <b>sterilisation</b> <b>process.</b> Autoclave {{is the most common}} device for sterilising instruments in order to prevent cross infections in dental offices. The autoclave efficiency has been improved in the last years and part of this improvement is related to both a better and more correct use of the autoclave system and to the technological innovations introduced in the last generation of devices. However, associations as ADA or CDC suggest to regularly verify the process of 'autoclaving' through biological indicators (BI). The most commonly used BI are made of spores strips or suspensions of Bacillus Subtilis (pb 168) and Bacillus Stearothermophilus (ATCC 10149). They visually prove, changing colours on enzymatic base, the death of micro-organism and if the physical parameters, necessary for sterilisation, have been achieved. These two strains of endospore-forming bacteria were processed and prepared following two different techniques: Karnovsky fixed and epon embedded [...] phosphotungstic acid fixed for direct observation. The kind and the extent of analysed modifications are extremely various: from deep lacerations, which changed the spore structure, to little clefts which let the cytoplasm go out...|$|E
