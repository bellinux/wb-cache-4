40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of term length on the {{behavior}} of legislators using field experiments in the Arkansas, Illinois and Texas Senates. After reapportionment, state senators are randomly assigned to serve either two-year or four-year terms, providing a rare opportunity to study legislative behavior experimentally. The evidence shows that in those states where candidates are allowed to spend and raise continuously throughout their <b>terms,</b> senators serving <b>shorter</b> <b>terms</b> raise and spend more money than senators serving longer terms, but only when the election is imminent. In some cases, senators serving <b>shorter</b> <b>terms</b> abstain more often, while in others they introduce fewer bills. <b>Shorter</b> <b>terms</b> do not result in increased responsiveness according to the rank-based measures analyzed. The results offer a different perspective on the classic view that <b>shorter</b> <b>terms</b> are unambiguously beneficial for constituents...|$|R

5|$|Cretton was {{inspired}} to write <b>Short</b> <b>Term</b> 12 based on his own experience of working in a group facility for teenagers.

While Larson and John Gallagher, Jr. won their roles after auditioning through Skype, most of the children featured in the film were cast through open casting calls. Filming took place over 20 days in Los Angeles, California in September 2012.|$|E

40|$|Debt {{maturity}} influences debt overhang, {{the reduced}} incentive for highly levered borrowers to make real investments because some value accrues to debt. Reducing maturity can {{increase or decrease}} overhang even when <b>shorter</b> <b>term</b> debt’s value depends less on firm value. Future overhang is more volatile for <b>shorter</b> <b>term</b> debt, making future investment incentives volatile and influencing immediate investment incentives. With immediate investment, <b>shorter</b> <b>term</b> debt typically imposes lower overhang; longer term debt can impose less if asset volatility is higher in bad times. For future investments, reduced correlation between assets-in-place and investment opportunities increases the <b>shorter</b> <b>term</b> debt overhang. THIS PAPER STUDIES THE effects of debt maturity on the current and future real investment decisions of an equity owner (or a manager who is compensated by equity). Our analysis is based on debt overhang first analyzed by Myers (1977), who points out that outstanding debt may distort the firm’s investment incentives downward.

5|$|In adults <b>short</b> <b>term</b> use {{of nasal}} decongestants {{may have a}} small benefit. Antihistamines may improve {{symptoms}} in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E
