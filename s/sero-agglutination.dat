The authors find that in most cases the milk reactions correspond to the <b>sero-agglutination</b> results, and that it is the agglutination of the stained antigen which is the principal sign of a positive reaction rather than ring formation, which is very irregular. Haematoxylin antigen is generally more reliable than Bendtsen antigen, but, with either, the results should be read after 1 - 2 hours' incubation at 37 °C. The authors conclude that the stained antigen test can be used for the detection of infection in herds of goats, but that it is not yet possible to say whether it is also valuable for detecting individual infection...|$|E
40|$|Background & Objectives: The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the possible effects of hydroalcoholic extract of Citrullus Colocynthis on the humoral and cellular immune responses in Wistar rats after challenge with REV- 1 vaccine. Materials & Methods: The studied population included 20 male rats that were randomly divided into two equal groups and were immunized with Rev 1 vaccine (0. 1 ml Rev 1 + 0. 9 ml PBS (. Treatment group received hydroalcoholic extract of the C. colocynthis (50 mg/kg) orally every day from the beginning of the study and it continued for two weeks. Blood sampling was performed five days after the last injection. Moreover, 48 hours before blood sampling, Rev 1 vaccine (0. 1 ml Rev 1 + 0. 9 ml PBS (was injected into the left foot of rats. The levels of anti-Rev 1 antibody and the specific cellular immune responses were measured by <b>sero-agglutination</b> test, footpad thickness, and griess colorimetric method, respectively. Lymphocyte proliferation, nitric oxide production, respiratory burst, and phagocytosis in splenocytes were determined by MTT test, Griess test, NBT assay, and slide test, respectively. Results: The levels of anti-Rev 1 antibody, phagocytosis and Lymphocyte proliferation index in splenocytes were increased in treatment group compared to control group. Nevertheless, the levels of the cellular immunity (food pad thickness), NBT, and Nitric oxide in treatment group showed a significant decrease compared to control group (p< 0 / 05). Conclusion: The hydroalcoholic extract of C. colocynthis may be used as a natural source for modulating the immune syste...|$|E
40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{conducted}} in a camel brucellosis-free herd to evaluate antibody response to the Brucella melitensis Rev. 1 vaccine in camels and assess shedding of the vaccine strain in milk. Twenty eight camels were divided into four groups according to their age and vaccination route. Groups A (n= 3) and B (n= 3) consisted of non-pregnant lactating female camels, vaccinated through subcutaneous and conjunctival routes, respectively. Groups C (n= 10) consisted of 8 - 11 months old calves vaccinated through conjunctival route. The rest of the herd (n= 12) composed of female and young camels were not vaccinated and were considered as the control group. Each animal from groups A, B and C was given the recommended dose of 2 x 109 colony forming units of Rev. 1 vaccine irrespective of age or route of vaccination. Blood samples were collected from all the animals {{at the time of}} vaccination and at weekly, bi-weekly and monthly interval until 32 weeks post vaccination and from controls at weeks 8 and 24. The serological tests used were modified Rose Bengal Test, <b>sero-agglutination</b> test, and an indirect Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Milk samples were collected from all vaccinated female camels and tested for the presence of Rev. 1 vaccine strain. Most vaccinated animals started to show an antibody response at week 2 and remained positive until week 16. By week 20 post-vaccination all animals in the three groups were tested negative for Brucella antibodies. Bacteriological analysis of milk samples did not allow any isolation of Brucella melitensis. All samples were found Brucella negative in PCR analysis. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the Rev. 1 vaccine induces seroconversion in camels. Rev. 1 vaccine strain is not excreted in the milk of camels. These findings are promising as to the safe use of the Rev. 1 vaccine in camels...|$|E
40|$|Os A. A. observaram um caso de infecção renal gonocócica, que relatam com as necessarias minucias, tanto sob o ponto de vista clinico-cirurgico como bacteriologico. 2 - Revendo a {{bibliografia}} sobre o assunto, verificaram que as infecções renais gonocócias são raras, e rarissimas as que apresentam provas de identificação bacteriologica completa do gonocóco, como se fez no presente caso que deve figurar em 15 º lugar, desde a descoberta do germen por Neisser, ha 59 anos. 3 - As provas bacteriologicas consistiram no exame bacterioscopico do sedimento urinario e pús renal, caracteres das colonias e culturas, seguidas de exames de esfregaços, provas de fermentação de glicose e maltose; sôro aglutinação e gono fixação. Todas as provas foram positivas para o gonocóco. 4 - O rim não deve ser favoravel á proliferação do gonocóco, ou pela natureza do seu epitelio ou pela secreção de substancias que impeçam o seu desenvolvimento ou outra causa qualquer. Dada a frequencia das infecções gonocócicas no parelho urinario inferior, seria de esperar que, em grande numero de casos, fosse atingido o superior. 5 - Como causas predisponentes a esse ataque secundario que se processa por vias sanguinea, linfatica ou contiguidade, cita Uhle as seguintes: 1 º - perturbações congenitas, lesões obstrutoras, principalmente do ureter. 2 º - calculos, tumores, etc. 3 º - traumatismos seguidos de rutura e hemorragia e 4 º - antecedentes patologícos não demonstrados. O nosso caso cabe no 2 º paragrafo. O rim apresentava um tumor maligno e tinha inumeros calculos. 6 - Depois que o rim foi retirado pela intervenção cirurgica, que correu sem acidentes, o doente entrou logo a melhorar, tendo alta curado, do Hospital. Nada tem havido, até a presente data, que faça suspeitar, no desenvolvimento de qualquer metastase do tumor. Aliás, a operação foi indicada em virtude do estado infeccioso, sendo posterior á mesma a descoberta do carcinoma. 7 - Interessante referir tambem que, muito embora o rim estivesse atacado pelo gonocóco, o aparelho urinario inferior nada acusou nesse sentido, nem antes da operação, nem depois do doente ter tido alta. 8 - Casos como o presente, se bem que raros, pois que assim se têm mostrado nos centros onde a pesquiza é sistematica, devem aparecer outras vezes, sendo, portanto, sempre aconselhavel o exame bacteriologico dos casos de infecções renais supuradas. 1 - The AA. {{observed a}} case of gonococcal infection of kidney which they report with the necessary details, both from the clinico-surgical and bacteriological standpoints. 2 - In perusing the bibliography on the matter, they verified that gonococcal infections of kidney are rare, and very rare those which present proofs of thorough bacteriological identification of the gonococcus, such as was furnished in the present case, which should occupy the 15 th place since {{the discovery of the}} germ by Neisser, 59 years ago. 3 - In the bacterioscopical examination of the urinary sediment and of the pus from the kidney the bacteriological proofs are constituted by the characteristic features of the colonies and cultures, followed by examinations of the smears, by fermentation tests for glucose and maltose, by <b>sero-agglutination</b> and gono-fixation. All tests were positive for gonococcus. 4 - The kidney does not favour the proliferation of the gonococcus, either thanks to the nature of its epithelium, or thanks to the secretion of substances which prevent the development of the gonococcus, or thanks to any other cause. Taking into consideration the frequency of gonococcal infections of the lower urinary apparatus, it was to be expected that also the upper one should be attained in a great deal of cases. 5 - As to the causes which predispose to such a secondary attack proceeding by the way of blood, of lymphatic current or by contiguity, uhle quotes the following: 1 º - Congenital disorders, obstruction changes, mainly of the ureter; 2 º - Calculi, tumors, etc.; 3 º - Traumatisms followed by rupture and hemorrhage; and 4 º - Previous pathological conditions not yet demonstrated. our case fits into the 2 º paragraph. The kidney presented a malignant tumor and contained numberless calculi. 6 - After the removal of the kidney by surgical intervention, which passed of without accidents, the patient soon began to improve being discharged on cure from the Hospital. Up to the present date, nothing occurred which might arouse the suspicion upon the development of any metastasis of the tumor. By the way, the operation had been indicated by virtue of the infectious condition, prior to the detection of the carcinoma. 7 - Another interesting fact to be recorded is also that the lower urinary apparatus, in spite of the kidney being attacked by gonococcus, showed nothing in this respect, either before the operation, or after the patient's dismissal. 8 - As may be seen from the works of the centres where investigations are systematically performed, cases such as the present one although rare have to appear again at times, and therefore the bacteriological examination of cases of suppurating renal infections is always to be recommended...|$|E
40|$|Passando em revista as experiencias de infecção que effectuamos e que acabamos de relatar, vemos que, as culturas isoladas de casos de Leishmaniose visceral {{americana}} quer do homem quer do cão, são capazes de infectar hamsters, rhesus e cães de maneira identica ao que acontece com as outras formas de Kala-Azar. Notamos ainda que a evolução da doença e as lesões observadas nos animaes assim infectados, se assemelham ao que tem sido observado nessa enfermidade aproximando-a de maneira singular do Kala-Azar mediterraneo. É sobretudo no cão que a semelhança se torna mais patente. A infecção da pelle e as lesões por ella provocadas que observamos, não differem em nada das que tem sido descriptas na infecção natural do cão e já assignaladas tambem na infecção experimental desse animal, embora de maneira menos completa do que fazemos agora aqui. As lesões oculares com formação de placas de keratite, a infeccção massiça do intestino nos casos fataes de infecção e até mesmo as lesões do figado descriptas por Adler como peculiares á infecção experimental, (infiltração em torno da veia central do lobulo) constituem outros tantos caracteres que mostram a completa analogia entre as infecções do cão que obtivemos e as já observadas no Kala-Azar mediterraneo. Além disso, a presença de Leishmanias na pelle, as vezes em grande numero e a constancia dessa localisação parasitaria, vem mostrar que o cão apresenta as condições necessarias para desempenhar o papel de depositario de virus tal como acontece no Kala-Azar mediterraneo, tanto mais que é elle encontrado naturalmente infectado, nas regiões em que grassa a doença. Mas não é só a infecção do cão que mostra essa semelhança; nos outros animaes tambem se verifica o mesmo facto e até pequenos signaes, taes como a tumefacção das patas assignalada nos hamsters infectados com Leishmania infantum, foram tambem observados aqui. Por outro lado, a reacção de sôro-agglutinação, conforme mostramos em trabalho anterior, não permite a separação das especies do genero Leishmania, pois todas ellas, quando recentemente isoladas, possuem identica constituição antigenica, que se modifica depois, pela conservação longo tempo em cultura. É esse facto, que deu logar ás conclusões contradictorias a que chegaram os autores que se ocuparam do assumpto bem como os primeiros resultados que obtivemos. Deante de todos esses factos, nos julgamos autorizados a concluir como já fizemos anteriormente, que o agente da Leishmaniose visceral americana é identico á Leishmania infantum. Ao terminar, queremos deixar consignados nossos agradecimentos ao Dr. E. chagas, por ter posto a nossa disposição as culturas de Leishmania por elle isoladas, tornando possivel deste modo, a execução do presente trabalho. With cultures {{isolated from}} cases of american visceral leishmaniasis we succeeded in obtaining experimental infections in hamsters (Cricetus cricetus), rhesus monkeys (Macaca mullata) and dogs. Hamsters were infected with strains obtained from man and dogs, the intraperitoneal way having been always employed. When cultures recently isolated are used, infection is obtained practically in 100 % {{of the animals}} inoculated. The first negative results obtained by us {{may be explained by}} the use of cultures isolated some time before (about 7 months 0 and which had lost already their virulence. In some cases external lesions are observed represented by alterations of the skin and swelling of the paws. The skin lesions are observed on the ventral surface and consist in depilation, erythema and exudation. The skin thus affected shows to be extremely friable, rupturing at the movements of the animal when hold. On post-mortem examination, besides the lesions pointed out, the animals present enlargement of the spleen. The parasites are very numerous in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, etc. The changed skin shows considerable hypertrophy of the epithelium with degeneration of the cells of the superficial layers, intensive infiltration of the derm by mononucleate cells full of parasites, and strong hyperemia. In rhesus monkey, we obtained until now, only one case of infection. The inoculation was made by the intraperitoneal way with cultures in Noeller's medium, isolated from a human case of visceral leishmaniasis, found in Chaco Argentino. About 8 months after the inoculation, the monkey was found in agony and was sacrified; the post-mortem examination showed that it was intensely infected. For infecting dogs, we employed young animals, 1 to 2 months old. The cultures were recently isolated (1 to 3 months) from man or dog. For the inoculation we used thick suspensions of flagellates from plate cultures by Mayer and Ray's method. The inoculations were carried out through the intraperitoneal way and renewed 3 to 4 times with intervals from 4 to 8 days. We observed an incubation period of 3 to 4 months when we used cultures obtained from dogs, and a period of 5 to 7 months, when employed human strains. Formerly, in order to verify the infection it, was used the liver puncture; later on we also examined the bone marrow removed by trepanation. We wish to emphasize the advantages derived from the examination of the bone marrow, as there the parasites are much more numerous than in the liver, thus making the examination easier. The infection shows itself in the animal by fever, anemia and emaciation at times attaining cachexia. Apart from this, skin lesions are observed represented by depilation, seborrhea, and even ulceration. In the dog A. we observed keratitis on both eyes, and in the dog C, diminution of vision nearly attaining complete blindness. What called our particular attention, was the infection of the skin. In this, parasites are always found in any region o fthe body, although presenting some elective sites such as the paws where the parasites first appear and where they generally are more numerous. At the beginning of the skin infection we see in the derm macrophages, containing parasites, generally 3 to 4, and arranged along the vascular tracts. With the exception of these macrophages, the skin looks nomral. The number of parasited macrophages increases gradually and then appear the changes of the skin here described. The main change observed is represented by infiltration of the derm by mononucleate cells. Such infiltration is mainly located around the pilo-sebaceous folliches. In other cases, the infiltation is located in the chorion. Finally, in certain cases of intense infiltration, it extends uniformly over the whole derm. The infiltration is sometimes constituted chiefly by parasited macrophages and this occurs mainly when the infiltration is not very intensive. When the infiltration becomes more intensive, the number of not parasited macrophages increases, and in cases of ulceration the parasited macrophages become very rare or entirely disappear. The four dogs experimentally infected which died either from the infection or from an intercurrent disease were all examined post-mortem. On the post-mortem examination, the macroscopical changes observed in a constant manner are not important and only consist in an enlargement of the spleen. In the dogA, we found keratitis already observed in the same living animal, and the intestine intensely congested with sanguinolent contents and the axillary and inguinal lymphatic glands enlarged and congested. Smears from the organs showed very numerous parasites, chiefly in the spleen, liver, bone marrow and lymphatic glands. In liver sections we observed the infiltration mainly located around or near by the intralobar vein a feature which already has been pointed out by Adler in the experimental infection of dog. Parasites were also found in Kupffer's cells, and a few parasited macrophages were observed in the porta-spaces {{as well as in the}} tissue of the lobule. The intestine of the same animal was intensely parasited, the Leishmaniae being located mainly in the mucous membrane, in infiltration cells located amongst Lieberkuehn's glands and some parasited macrophages could also be observed in the sub-mucosa. Mice as well as the rodents Dasyprocta agouti and Proechymis oris when inoculated, did not become infeced. From the exposed we may conclude that the experimental infections obtained, present a complete analogy with those described in the Mediterrean Kala-azar. On the other hand, the <b>sero-agglutination</b> test, as shown by us in a previous paper, allows no distinction of the species of Leishmania, as all the strains when recently isolated, have the same antigenic constitution which later on undergoes modifications when the Leishmaniae are preserved in culture for a long time. Thus, we feel authorized to conclude that the agent of the visceral american leishmaniasis is identical with L. infantum...|$|E
