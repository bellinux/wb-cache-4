5|$|Singers {{and players}} admired Britten's conducting, and David Webster rated it highly enough {{to offer him}} the musical {{directorship}} of the Covent Garden Opera in 1952. Britten declined; he was not confident of his ability as a conductor and was reluctant to <b>spend</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> performing rather than composing. As a conductor, Britten's repertory included Purcell, Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Schubert, and occasional less characteristic choices including Schumann's Scenes from Goethe's Faust; Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius and Introduction and Allegro; Holst's Egdon Heath and short pieces by Percy Grainger.|$|E
5|$|Youth <b>spend</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant {{from what the}} youth may already know. The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This {{is followed by a}} period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E

25|$|Soloveitchik's four step {{scholarly}} {{approach to}} learning has influenced many of his students. The approach {{can be traced back}} to the approach of the Gaon of Vilna. The first step is concentrating on the text. This follows the Vilna Gaon's approach of carefully amending the texts of both exoteric (the Talmud) and esoteric works (for instance, the Torat Kohanim, Tosefta, Avot de-Rabbi Natan, etc.). The second step is knowing the physical reality of the objects described. Third is the conceptual analysis proffered by Rishonim. At this point he introduces an important distinction between Rishonim, which are primary sources, and must be mastered, even if one has to struggle to understand them; and Achronim, which are secondary sources, which can be exploited (if you find good material, use it, but if you don't understand it, don't <b>spend</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> on it). The fourth and final step is sevarah, creating the intellectual framework underpinning the Torah.|$|E

2500|$|Gibson {{returned}} to baseball in 1981 after accepting a coaching job with Joe Torre, {{who was then}} manager of the New York Mets. Torre termed Gibson's position [...] "attitude coach", the first such title in Major League history. After Torre and his coaching staff were let go {{at the end of}} the 1981 season, Torre moved on to manage the Atlanta Braves in 1982, hiring Gibson as a pitching coach. The Braves proceeded to challenge for the National League pennant for the first time since 1969, ultimately losing to the Cardinals in the 1982 National League Championship Series. Gibson remained with Torre on the Braves' coaching staff until the end of the 1984 season.
