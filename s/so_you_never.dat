500|$|King told D. X. Ferris that [...] "whenever 'Raining Blood' {{comes in}} the set, it just electrifies the whole crowd. People just shit {{when you hit the}} first few notes. Like 'Jesus Christ it's a guitar, settle down.'" [...] In the past, Slayer used fake blood to cover their bodies when {{performing}} the song live. However, when asked about using fake blood in future performances, King remarked [...] "It's time to move on, but never say never. I know Japan never saw it, South America and Australia never saw it. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know." ...|$|E
500|$|King {{later said}} that while the idea of playing Reign in Blood in its {{entirety}} was suggested before by their booking agency, it was met with little support. The band ultimately decided they needed to add more excitement to their live shows, and to avoid repetition incorporated the ideas of raining blood. When asked about using fake blood in future performances, King remarked: [...] "It's time to move on, but never say never. I know Japan never saw it, South America and Australia never saw it. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know." [...] In 2008 the band performed Reign in Blood in its entirety once again, this time in Paris, France, during the third European Unholy Alliance Tour.|$|E
500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> really know exactly what he looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite what it looks like or what it can do...The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic in shape, and the critic Tim Dirks mentions its 'open, dripping vaginal mouth.|$|E

2500|$|Fraser McAlpine {{from the}} BBC's Chartblog rated the song three stars out of five, {{stating that the}} song was [...] "the sort of thing we've all heard {{hundreds}} of times" [...] yet praised Ewen's vocal abilities: [...] "Still, Jade Ewen has a formidable set of pipes and copes admirably with the mad range the song requires, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} with Raissman, Russo {{did not rule}} out a reunion with Francesa. Russo said, [...] "You never want to say never. You know how the radio business is. <b>So,</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> say never, but I haven’t thought about it in my crystal ball, let's put it that way... But I’ll tell you right now, if Mike and I did shows together we would have no trouble picking right up where we left off." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for the ESPN documentary series SportsCentury in 2002, Clemente's widow Vera mentioned that Clemente had told her several times {{that he thought he}} was going to die young. Indeed, while being asked by broadcaster and future fellow Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn in July 1971 during the All-Star Game activities about when he would get his 3,000 career hit, Clemente's response was [...] "Well, uh, you never know. I, I, uh, if I'm alive, like I said before, you never know because God tells you how long you're going to be here. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know what can happen tomorrow." [...] Clemente's older stepbrother, Luis, died on December 31, 1954 and his stepsister a few years later.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with CNN, band member Don Henley declared, [...] "This {{is probably the}} last Eagles album that we'll ever make." [...] When questioned {{about the possibility of}} a follow-up album in November 2010, band member Timothy B. Schmit said, [...] "My first reaction would be: no way. But I said that before the last one, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> really know. Bands are a fragile entity and you never know what's going to happen. It took a long time to do that last album, over a span of years, really, and it took a lot out of us. We took a year off at one point. I'm not sure if we're able to do that again. I wouldn't close the door on it, but I don't know." [...] In a 2010 {{interview with}} undercover.fm, Joe Walsh said that the band might be able to make one more album before the band [...] "wraps it up".|$|E
2500|$|Asked in November 2010 {{whether the}} Eagles were {{planning}} {{a follow-up to}} Long Road Out of Eden, Schmit replied, [...] "My first reaction would be: no way.

[...] Frey later stated in a 2012 interview that the band has had discussions about releasing an EP of potentially 4–6 songs that may contain both original and cover material.|$|E
2500|$|That same month, Ciara {{said that}} there was no release date for the album. She instead said [...] "I think I'm almost done. I think there was a date December 4 that was {{supposedly}} put in the universe, but the date was never ever confirmed, not from my mouth, but they can definitely look out for this album this winter. I'll be telling you soon. Stay tuned. You know what? I'm giving you guys my video [...] on my birthday, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know what could happen around Christmas-time. I love giving gifts." [...] After the premiere of the [...] "Got Me Good" [...] video, the album was slated to drop in early 2013. On April 15, 2013, Ciara revealed the official tracklist for the album and confirmed that it is now titled Ciara. Additionally, she stated that it would be released on June 4, 2013. The album was then postponed to July 9, 2013. The aforementioned singles were swept aside from the album and subsequently under the title Ciara, the album is now led by the single [...] "Body Party". The album artwork features a mirror-flipped image of Ciara.|$|E
