5|$|In 1792 {{over the}} 25 {{days of the}} first {{landfall}} in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, Delahaye established a European vegetable garden. Its purpose was {{as a source of}} food and propagation material for the indigenous people, and also as a supply of provisions for future visiting European vessels. This was the first European garden on mainland Tasmania, planted just north of where the ships were anchored and, until recently, was last sighted by Lady Jane Franklin in the 1840s. Offshore, on Bruny Island, a small orchard had been planted a few months previously by Englishman William Bligh's expedition, presumably planted by Bligh's gardener David Nelson. Delahaye's journal reports that he planted celery, chervil, chicory, cabbages, grey romaine lettuce, different kinds of turnip, white onion, radishes, sorrel, peas, black <b>salsify</b> and potatoes; he also had large quantities sewn in the woods, thrown at random where they might grow. Returning on 21 January 1793 the garden had not been productive, the seed having been planted in dry and sandy soil. This time Delahaye tried explaining to the Aboriginal people, referred to today as the Lyluequonny, that the tubers, when cooked in fire embers, made fine eating. Calling in on the Adventure Bay side of Bruny Island Delahaye examined and tended the two pomegranate, one quince and three fig trees planted by Bligh’s expedition in 1792.|$|E
25|$|Around the Mediterranean, {{such as in}} Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Turkey, the midveins of the rosette {{leaves of}} S. hispanicus, known in Spain as cardillo, are used as a popular wild food. It is {{generally}} gathered in April and May. These midveins are preboiled and lightly fried with garlic in olive oil. These serve as garnish for cocido. Fried cardillo is further combined with garlic, cured ham and hard-boiled or scrambled eggs. Midveins are also used raw in salads. The roots are cooked and eaten, and compare in taste to <b>salsify.</b> Roasted roots {{have been used as}} a coffee substitute. Florets have been used as imitation saffron.|$|E
2500|$|Other fruits are {{elongated}} and flattened out naturally, and so become thin, like wings or helicopter blades, e.g., elm, maple, and tuliptree. This is {{an evolutionary}} mechanism to increase dispersal distance {{away from the}} parent, via wind. Other wind-dispersed fruit have tiny [...] "parachutes", e.g., dandelion, milkweed, <b>salsify.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>salsifies</b> {{are mostly}} natives of Europe and Asia, but several {{species have been}} {{introduced}} into North America and Australia and have spread widely there. There is one species considered native to North America, Tragopogon mirus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Salsifies</b> are forbs {{growing as}} {{biennial}} or perennial plants. They {{have a strong}} taproot and milky sap. They generally have few branches, and those there are tend to be upright. Their leaves are somewhat grass-like. Flower colour varies within the genus, with some yellow species, and some bronze or purple. Seeds are borne in a globe {{like that of a}} dandelion but larger, and are dispersed by the wind.|$|R
5000|$|Agricultural {{production}} {{of a variety of}} food items expanded: olive oil, wine, cider, woad (Fr. [...] "pastel", a source of blue dye), and saffron. The South grew artichokes, melons, romaine lettuce, eggplant, <b>salsifys,</b> celery, fennel, parsley, and alfalfa. After 1500 New World crops appeared such as beans, corn (maize), squash, tomatoes, potatoes, and bell peppers. Production techniques remained attached to medieval traditions and produced low yields. With the rapidly expanding population, additional land suitable for farming became scarce. The situation was made worse by repeated disastrous harvests in the 1550s.|$|R
50|$|Western <b>salsify</b> {{is quite}} similar to the {{generally}} commoner meadow <b>salsify,</b> T. pratensis, but the bracts which show behind the flower head, a distinctive feature of salsifies, are longer and more noticeable. Although not particularly closely related to meadow <b>salsify</b> or the common <b>salsify</b> or oyster plant (T. porrifolius), the western <b>salsify</b> hybridises readily with both, and in North America its hybrids {{have given rise to}} the new alloploid hybrid species T. mirus and T. miscellus.|$|E
50|$|Tragopogon dubius (yellow <b>salsify,</b> western <b>salsify,</b> western goat's-beard, wild oysterplant, yellow goat's beard, goat's beard, goatsbeard, common <b>salsify,</b> <b>salsify)</b> is {{a species}} of <b>salsify</b> native to {{southern}} and central Europe and western Asia and found as far north and west as northern France. Although {{it has been reported}} from Kashmir and India, recent evidence suggests that specimens from these areas may be a different species. Western <b>salsify</b> has been introduced into North America where it has become widespread, being reported from all the continental United States except for a few in the far south-east, and all provinces of Canada except Newfoundland and the northern territories.|$|E
50|$|Because western <b>salsify</b> is a {{widespread}} plant, it has {{a large number of}} alternative common names. They include western goat's beard, wild oysterplant, yellow <b>salsify,</b> yellow goat's beard, meadow goat's beard, goat's beard, goatsbeard, common <b>salsify,</b> or <b>salsify.</b> Some of these are also, or more commonly, used for other species, and are better avoided. A synonym, Tragopogon major, may also be encountered.|$|E
2500|$|David Wilson, {{editor and}} co-creator of the website Wilson & Alroys' Record Reviews, stated that [...] "By 2009, reggaeton had largely run its course, and Vico C wisely retrenched toward the minimalist Latin-ized hip hop of the Xplosión era (title track, with melodramatic but {{effective}} synth strings). There's nothing shockingly innovative like his first successes, {{but by now}} he's experienced enough {{to work with a}} limited palette while still giving each track an individual affect ('Prueba De Farmacia', which somehow manages not to be sappy; the <b>salsified</b> 'Aqui La Que Fallo Fue Usted'). Another of Vico C's strengths is his ability to vary vocal tone and timbre to suit a song: playfully prickly on 'Payasito'; tender on 'Moriré'; commanding on the upbraiding 'Polvora'. He still has an unfortunate tendency to moralize ('El Corazón Se Pone Bruto'; 'Angelina'), but his skills are equally undimmed by time, and though no one tune is a socks-rocker, it all adds up to a satisfying whole." [...] Wilson gave the album 3 stars out of 5.|$|R
50|$|Scorzonera hispanica, black <b>salsify</b> or Spanish <b>salsify,</b> {{also known}} as black oyster plant, serpent root, viper's herb, viper's grass or simply scorzonera, is a {{perennial}} member of the genus Scorzonera in the sunflower family (Asteraceae), cultivated as a root vegetable {{in the same way}} as purple <b>salsify</b> (Tragopogon porrifolius), also in the sunflower family.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vegetable}} called <b>salsify</b> {{is usually}} {{the root of the}} purple <b>salsify,</b> Tragopogon porrifolius; the root is described as having the taste of oysters (hence the alternative common name [...] "oyster plant" [...] for some species in this genus), but more insipid with a touch of sweetness. The young shoots of purple <b>salsify</b> can also be eaten, as well as young leaves http://www.northernbushcraft.com/plants/salsify/notes.htm. Other species are also used in the same way, including the black or Spanish <b>salsify,</b> Scorzonera hispanica, which is closely related though {{not a member of the}} genus Tragopogon.|$|E
50|$|Tragopogon porrifolius is a plant {{cultivated}} for its ornamental flower, edible root, and herbal properties. It also grows wild in {{many places}} {{and is one of}} the most widely known species of the <b>salsify</b> genus, Tragopogon. It is commonly known as purple or common <b>salsify,</b> oyster plant, vegetable oyster, Jerusalem star, goatsbeard or simply <b>salsify</b> (although these last two names are also applied to other species, as well).|$|E
50|$|Skirret has {{a cluster}} of bright white, sweetish, {{somewhat}} aromatic roots, each approximately 15-20 cm in length. These are used as a vegetable {{in the same manner}} as the common <b>salsify,</b> black <b>salsify</b> and the parsnip.|$|E
50|$|Tragopogon, {{also known}} as goatsbeard or <b>salsify,</b> is a genus of {{flowering}} plants in the sunflower family. It includes the vegetable known as <b>salsify,</b> {{as well as a}} number of common wild flowers, some of which are usually regarded as weeds.|$|E
50|$|Black <b>salsify</b> {{is often}} eaten {{together}} with other vegetables, such as peas and carrots. But it is also popular served like asparagus in a white sauce, such as bechamel sauce, mustard sauce or hollandaise sauce. Boiled <b>salsify</b> roots may also be coated with batter and deep fried.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{some other}} species of <b>salsify</b> such as the oyster plant Tragopogon porrifolius, western <b>salsify</b> is not {{generally}} regarded as edible, though the root can be eaten (raw or cooked) and so can the young stems. No uses in herbal medicine are commonly known. It is regarded as invasive in most states of the USA and in some Canadian provinces such as Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the more}} common species of Tragopogon are known, in the regions where they are most common, by the common names goat's beard, goatsbeard, <b>salsify,</b> or common <b>salsify,</b> without further qualification. These names are {{therefore}} inherently ambiguous, and best avoided, or reserved for the genus collectively. In the species list below, the first common name given {{is the one that}} seems to be most widely used for that species and is not in significant use for any other species.|$|E
5000|$|Tragopogon is {{one example}} where hybrid {{speciation}} has been observed. In the early 20th century, humans introduced three species of <b>salsify</b> into North America. These species, the western <b>salsify</b> (Tragopogon dubius), the meadow <b>salsify</b> (Tragopogon pratensis), and the oyster plant (Tragopogon porrifolius), are now common weeds in urban wastelands. In the 1950s, botanists found two new species in the regions of Idaho and Washington, where the three already known species overlapped. One new species, Tragopogon miscellus, is a tetraploid hybrid of T. dubius and T. pratensis. The other new species, Tragopogon mirus, is also an allopolyploid, but its ancestors were T. dubius and T. porrifolius. These new species are usually referred to as [...] "the Ownbey hybrids" [...] after the botanist who first described them. The T. mirus population grows mainly by reproduction of its own members, but additional episodes of hybridization continue {{to add to the}} T. mirus population.|$|E
50|$|Scorzonera libanotica, {{also known}} as the Lebanese <b>salsify</b> and Lebanese viper's grass (دَبَح لُبْناني) is a {{perennial}} member of the genus Scorzonera in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).|$|E
50|$|Vegetables {{are hardly}} ever a main but almost always a side dish. Very common are sauerkraut, white cabbage, red cabbage, savoy cabbage, Kohlrabi and also carrot. <b>Salsify</b> is also often {{featured}} in dishes, {{and has been}} grown in Franconia since the 17th century. In winter they are served in a cream sauce with ham and potatoes. In summer a variation of this dish is served but with asparagus originating in the region north of Nürnberg instead of the <b>salsify.</b> But the asparagus is also used in salads or is eaten with the famous Bratwurst.|$|E
50|$|They are {{distributed}} in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Its center of diversity {{is in the}} Mediterranean. Well-known species include the edible black <b>salsify</b> (Scorzonera hispanica). Scorzonera tau-saghyz {{is a source of}} natural rubber.|$|E
50|$|The black <b>salsify</b> {{plant has}} heads of yellow ray flowers. The thin black taproot grows {{up to one}} meter long and up to 2 cm in diameter. It has a black skin with white {{internal}} flesh.|$|E
50|$|Several species {{names have}} been {{published}} in the genus, but only one is recognized. Geropogon hybridus, the pasture goatsbeard or slender <b>salsify,</b> is native to the Mediterranean and adjacent areas, from the Canary Islands to Iran.|$|E
5000|$|In Armenia, rural kids make {{bubble gum}} from the juice of meadow <b>salsify.</b> For this purpose, when milky juice is {{released}} from the torn stems it is collected {{on the walls of}} a glass and dried.|$|E
50|$|The roots can {{be eaten}} raw or cooked like potatoes. They {{can be used}} from the young plant, from September until the first {{flowering}} stem is developed. If soaked in water and boiled the taste is similar to black <b>salsify</b> root.|$|E
5000|$|In one of {{the episodes}} from the winter series, Fearnley-Whittingstall captures, prepares and cooks rabbits that he finds on his {{property}} and introduces viewers to a root called [...] "salsify"—according to the host, <b>salsify</b> was popular during the Victorian era.|$|E
5000|$|The black <b>salsify</b> is {{considered}} nutritious: it contains proteins, fats, asparagine, choline, laevulin, {{as well as}} minerals such as potassium, calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, and vitamins A, B1, E and C. It also contains the polysaccharide inulin, conferring a mild sweetness that is suitable for diabetics [...]|$|E
