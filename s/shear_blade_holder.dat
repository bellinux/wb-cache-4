The <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> may either retract or fold into the handle, much like a folding-blade pocketknife.

40|$|Artschwager {{described}} a cooling apparatus for handling paraffin ribbons during hot weather. Use of this device in our laboratory {{during the summer}} has proven highly satisfactory {{and at the same}} time it suggested to us the idea of using the same principle for keeping the knife blade cool while cutting. Accordingly, a copper box was made 12 x 6 x 4 inches, as shown in the accompanying figure. A suitable lid should be made from the same material. On the back of this box was soldered a narrow strip of copper, which was allowed to project approximately seven inches beyond the end of the box. This projecting strip should be just wide enough to fit into the groove on the back of the <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> of the microtome, which happens to be just one-half inch in the case of the <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> used in our laboratory. It should be soldered to the back of the box just high enough from the bottom to permit it to slide easily into the <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> groove when the holder is in place on the microtome.

40|$|DE 1004020898 A UPAB: 20051222 NOVELTY - Blades(9) {{attached}} to a holder(3) make a rotating or oscillating movement relative to a perforated plate(1) and are pressed against the plate with a prescribed pressure. A pressure sensor(11) on each blade(9) is connected to a control unit which sets the required pressure and/or adjusts the blade position relative to the perforated plate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Each sensor(11) comprises a piezo resistive component, preferably a thin diamond-like carbon layer with piezo resistive properties. Sensors are arranged at the connection between each blade(9) and blade holder(3). preferably mounted directly on a component, a <b>blade</b> or <b>blade</b> <b>holder.</b> Several sensors can be arranged along the blade length. Strain gauges may act as additional sensors on the blades or additional piezo actuators(12) may be incorporated between <b>blade</b> and <b>blade</b> <b>holder.</b> <b>Blades</b> can be adjusted on the holder. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for measuring and adjusting blade pressure against a perforated plate with a wear resistant coating in which: a) the forces between each blade and perforated plate are measured by a piezo resistive type pressure sensor; b) the results are sent to a control unit for comparison with both a set minimum pressure of the <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> and also a value for the maximum permissible pressure applied onto the plate coating; c) the applied pressure of the <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> can be varied up or down if required depending on the comparison. USE - For measuring and adjusting force between blades and perforated plate on a plastics granulating machine. ADVANTAGE - Individual blade pressures can be measured directly to prevent overloading blades, perforated plate and plate coating and the intervals between blade changing are increased...|$|R
50|$|<b>Blade</b> <b>shearing</b> as a {{sport has}} been through some ups and downs since the 1980s {{but in the last}} 2 or three years, it has {{increased}} in popularity. In the last 30 years many <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> competitions have been discontinued but now, with a resurgence of interest, the number of <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> competitions seems to be increasing. There were only 3 <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> competitions in Australia 25 years ago but that number has recently increased to at least 14 this year. In the UK this year a show was created specifically for <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> and to promote the <b>blade</b> <b>shearing</b> circuit in the UK.

40|$|A tissue machine {{suffering}} from Yankee chatter marks has been experimentally investigated. A series of vibration measurements during normal operation at various Yankee speeds {{on both the}} creping and the cleaning <b>blade</b> <b>holders</b> have been carried out. The analysis in a frequency range up to 20 kHz has permitted to identify speed dependent frequency peaks and broadband high frequency vibration content on the creping zone. Hence, an experimental modal analysis of the creping <b>blade</b> and <b>holder</b> {{has been carried out}} with the machine stopped to identify its natural frequencies. As a result, resonance conditions have been identified due to the gearbox excitation originated by the meshing process. The study of the corresponding mode shapes has permitted to understand the vibration behavior and its relationship with the damage. To solve the problem, the creping <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> structure has been redesigned to detune the resonances. Since this overhaul, comparable measurements have confirmed a significant reduction of vibrations and high frequency noise. The appearance of chatter marks has been minimized.

40|$|<b>Shear</b> <b>blades</b> are {{extensively}} used in {{the recycling}} of metal scrap. A comparative study was conducted on used medium carbon NiCrVMo and CrB containing steel scrap <b>shear</b> <b>blades</b> to better understand their wear mechanisms under service conditions. The microstructure and hardness of worn cutting edges and bulk material were characterised by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and microanalysis, X-ray diffraction analysis and macro/micro hardness testing. Moreover, tensile and Charpy impact properties {{were obtained from the}} bulk material. Several wear mechanisms were identified in both blades which are categorised in two main groups, i. e. spalling and progressive wear. The progressive wear due to abrasive, adhesive and oxidation wear was observed in both blades. In NiCrVMo-steel blades, spalling and crack propagation from surface/subsurface white etching layers mainly caused the severe wear. However, spalling due to delamination wear and crack propagation from severely subsurface deformed layers was the dominant severe wear mechanism in CrB-steel blades...|$|R
40|$|An {{electronically-controlled}} meat butchering {{machine has}} a quick-change cutting tool in a grip {{at the end}} of a manipularot arm. The <b>blade</b> (6) and <b>holder</b> are powered by a drive unit linked to a moment sensor measuring device (3), The blade is also linked to a blade-changer unit attached to the drive (5). The novelty is that: (a) a turning unit (4) is incorporated between the power sensor (3) and the blade (6) drive (5); (b) the turning unit (4) is a passive following device; (c) the turning unit (4) extended axis of rotation (8) runs outside of the blade centre towards the blade (6) cutting edge (9); (d) the blade-changing unit (10) consists of two or more blade-holders (11); (e) each <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> (11) is positioned facing a cutter-arrester system (12); (f) the blade-holder (11) can be moved with respect to the cutter-arrester system (12); (g) each blade-holder (11) is connected to a blade cleaning system; (h) each <b>blade</b> <b>holder</b> may be linked to a blade sharpener. USE- The machine contin ues meat butchering operations with the installed blade, while the previously-used blade is being sharpened and cleaned.

50|$|Used doctor blades, from gravure {{and other}} {{printing}} and coating processes, may be inspected using a goniometer, typically {{with a built-in}} light source, to examine the blade edge {{to see whether the}} blade has worn at the desired angle and whether there are signs of wear at other angles.

Double bow shears are by far the most common as they are the most versatile. Single bow shears and inverse bowed shears offer more resistance and are mostly only used for tough shearing sheep.

50|$|In New Zealand, {{there are}} still {{approximately}} 40 commercial blade shearers who work between July and October each year. Between these shearers, 400,000 sheep are shorn each year in New Zealand, mostly in Otago and the Canterbury high country.

The simplified analytical solution obtained in this paper is based on the fracture mechanics energy balance and the limiting equilibrium approaches.

Comparison of results from different approaches provides an insight into the complex domain of modeling shear band propagation in soils. ...|$|R
