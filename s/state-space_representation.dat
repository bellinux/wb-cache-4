The resulting transformation yields an LPV model where the scheduling parameter depends on the derivatives of the inputs and outputs of the system.

40|$|Abstract The {{framework}} of Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) systems concerns linear dynamical systems whose <b>state-space</b> <b>representations</b> depend on exogenous non-stationary parameters. Since its introduction by Shamma and Athans in 1988 to model gain scheduling, the LPV paradigm {{has become a}} standard formalism in systems and controls, with many papers devoted to analysis, controller synthesis, and system identification of LPV models. This chapter reviews basic concepts and presents a representative selection of analytical approaches for LPV systems. 1 Introducing LPV Systems Origins. The {{framework of}} Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) systems concerns linear dynamical systems whose <b>state-space</b> <b>representations</b> depend on exogenous nonstationary parameters, as in ˙x = A(θ) x+B(θ) u y = C(θ) x, (1) where u is an input, y is an output, and θ is an exogenous parameter that can be time dependent. The LPV paradigm {{was introduced in the}} Ph. D. thesis of Shamma [74] for the analysis of the control design practice of “gain-scheduling ” [4, Chapter 9]. In brief, gain-scheduling is a control design approach that constructs a nonlinear controller for a nonlinear plant by patching together a collection of linear controllers. These linear controllers are blended in real-time (e. g., via switching or interpolation) ac...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} digital {{waveguide}} modeling of wind instruments. It presents {{the application of}} <b>state-space</b> <b>representations</b> for the refined acoustic model of Webster-Lokshin. This acoustic model describes the propagation of longitudinal waves in axisymmetric acoustic pipes with a varying cross-section, visco-thermal losses at the walls, and without assuming planar or spherical waves. Moreover, three types of discontinuities of the shape can {{be taken into account}} (radius, slope and curvature). The purpose of this work is to build low-cost digital simulations in the time domain based on the Webster-Lokshin model. First, decomposing a resonator into independent elementary parts and isolating delay operators lead to a Kelly-Lochbaum network of input/output systems and delays. Second, for a systematic assembling of elements, their <b>state-space</b> <b>representations</b> are derived in discrete time. Then, standard tools of automatic control are used to reduce the complexity of digital simulations in the time domain. The method is applied to a real trombone, and results of simulations are presented and compared with measurements. This method seems to be a promising approach in term of modularity, complexity of calculation and accuracy, for any acoustic resonators based on tubes...|$|R
