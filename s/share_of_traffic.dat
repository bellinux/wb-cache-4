40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} the {{performance}} of the proportional fair scheduler, which has been proposed for the emerging 3. 5 G radio access technologies. It maximizes systems’ spectral efficiency, which is a strong incentive for network providers to use it. Our goal is to investigate whether the proportional fair scheduler also provides benefits to the users. Focus is on the throughput-delay trade-offs associated with video streaming over HSDPA. Special attention is devoted to defining appropriate performance measures and creating a realistic simulation environment. Our results indicate that the opportunistic scheduling faces major difficulties to ensure the user-level performance in cases where streaming flows constitute a significant <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> load.

40|$|This {{research}} starts {{by analyzing}} the pre-failure condition in a wireless network with Mobile IP and proposes a novel approach using load balancing concept of foreign agents to tolerate their failures. It involves distributing the traffic to the foreign agents {{in a way that}} each foreign agent has comparable traffic. In the proposed approach, we don`t require any recovery procedure whenever a foreign agent recovers from failure. A recovered foreign agent automatically gets its <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> as soon as it moves back into the system. We analyze our approach through simulation. The results indicate that the approach improves the pre-failure condition in a wireless network with Mobile IP and this improvement in turn results in an efficient fault tolerant approach to tolerate failure of foreign agents...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{work on the}} risk-averse routing of {{hazardous}} materials has focussed on ways of finding the safest route between a pair of points.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{trend in}} Internet usage have seen {{large amount of}} {{multimedia}} data due to increasingly large number of mobile users. To facilitate higher bandwidth, modern mobile routers are capable of supporting simultaneous multi-band, leading to less interference, higher capacity and better reliability. However, there exists no previous work that attempt to maximize utilization of available bandwidth through the <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> classes among different frequency bands of the mobile router. In this paper, we have proposed a novel scheduling algorithm for multi-band mobile routers which transmits different classes <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> through different frequency bands to achieve improved performance. We have developed an analytical model to perform queuing analysis of the proposed multi-band system and derived various performance metrics, validated by extensive simulations. Our {{results show that the}} proposed architecture can ensure maxi-mum possible utilization through <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> capacities among the bands. Our proposed scheduling algorithm and related analytical model can help network engineers build next generation mobile routers with higher throughput and utilization ensuring least packet loss for different classes <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> Index Terms—Analytical modeling, scheduling algorithm, queuing system, real-time traffic, next generation mobile routers.
