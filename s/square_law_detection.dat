40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The thesis describes {{an analysis of}} a Magnetic Anomaly Detection (MAD) buoy field. The analysis was based on estimates of the probability a submarine would be detected during an encounter with MAD buoy. The estimates were determined by using a simulation of both a crosscorrelation detection system and <b>square</b> <b>law</b> <b>detection</b> system. Using estimates, a random search model {{was used to determine}} a lower bound on the search effectiveness of a MAD buoy field. In doing this, the effects of false alarm rate, sweep width, noise level, buoy depth, and target displacement were analyzed. A discussion of the simulation inputs, as well as a program listing are included in the thesis in order to facilitate future use of the simulation. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Monte Carlo Methods are {{introduced}} {{and used to}} estimate false alarm proba-bilities. The estimation of the latter {{is important in the}} context of performance analysis of Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) radar detection processes. A CFAR detector estimates the clutter level, producing a threshold, and a target is declared present if the statistic representing the test observation exceeds this threshold. The latter is adjusted adaptively, so that the rate of false alarms is held constant. Hence, in a radar analysis context, the performance of a CFAR process can be determined from whether it maintains a constant false alarm rate. In order to compare the performance of a number of different CFAR schemes, in a common clutter environment, we need to estimate these false alarm probabilities. This can be done quite easily using a basic Monte Carlo estimator. However, the latter may require {{a very large number of}} iterations in order to produce a reasonable estimate. To reduce this number of iterations, importance sampling techniques can be used. To illustrate these techniques, we consider the simple case of cell averaging CFAR in a Gaussian environ-ment, with <b>square</b> <b>law</b> <b>detection.</b> This enables comparison of estimators with an exact result.

40|$|The {{development}} of ultra high speed (~ 20 Gsamples/s) analogue to digital converters (ADCs), and the delayed deployment of 40 Gbit/s transmission {{due to the}} economic downturn, has stimulated the investigation of digital signal processing (DSP) techniques for compensation of optical transmission impairments. In the future, DSP will offer an entire suite of tools to compensate for optical impairments and facilitate the use of advanced modulation formats. Chromatic dispersion is a very significant impairment for high speed optical transmission. This thesis investigates a novel electronic method of dispersion compensation which allows for cost-effective accurate detection of the amplitude and phase of the optical field into the radio frequency domain. The first electronic dispersion compensation (EDC) schemes accessed only the amplitude information using <b>square</b> <b>law</b> <b>detection</b> and achieved an increase in transmission distances. This thesis presents a method by using a frequency sensitive filter to estimate the phase of the received optical field and, {{in conjunction with the}} amplitude information, the entire field can be digitised using ADCs. This allows DSP technologies {{to take the next step}} in optical communications without requiring complex coherent detection. This is of particular of interest in metropolitan area networks. The full-field receiver investigated requires only an additional asymmetrical Mach-Zehnder interferometer and balanced photodiode to achieve a 50 % increase in EDC reach compared to amplitude only detection...|$|E

40|$|A {{discussion}} {{of the problem of}} sodium vapor bubble collapse is presented. The physics of vapor collapse is presented in light of the work by Peppler et al. Theoretical estimates of the sound source level based on the work by Rayleigh and Judd are compared to an approximate pressure-volume work approach and recent experimental observations. Reactor ambient noise and transmission loss considerations are presented in regard to their impact on this detection problem. A methodology is proposed which considers the importance of the sound source level, ambient noise, transmission loss and a detection threshold and provides a means by which the feasibility of sodium vapor bubble collapse detection in an operating LMFBR may be assessed. The interrelationships between the detection threshold and the probability of detection and false alarm are discussed and applied to a standard acoustic <b>square</b> <b>law</b> <b>detection</b> system. This analysis clearly illustrates that the feasibility of such a detection system is strongly dependent on the knowledge of sound source levels, ambient noise levels and the transmission loss between the source and receiver. Furthermore, requirements of a high degree of probability of detection and a low probability of false alarm were found to require a high signal to noise ratio for a single sensor system but that the probability of false alarm requirement could be relaxed for systems multiple independent sensors. Finally, the need for additional experimental and theoretical information is presented in terms of sound source levels, ambient noise and a means for determining transmission loss. (auth...|$|E

40|$|A <b>Square</b> <b>Law</b> Device may be {{considered}} as being any circuit or arrangement of components, capable of producing an output proportional to the mathematical square of the input. These devices may be electrical, mechanical, hydraulic or any combination of these. The thesis is confined to electrical <b>square</b> <b>law</b> devices, which {{are by far the}} most numerous. The input and output quantities are usually represented as voltages or currents. A literature survey was conducted and a large number of different types of <b>square</b> <b>law</b> devices were revealed. These have been classified into sections, depending on the mode of squaring, and each has been examined for various properties. Some devices have been examined theoretically, and others by actually developing and constructing a circuit and taking a series of measurements, in each case a conclusion is drawn concerning the accuracy, frequency response and dynamic range. This classification and examination of <b>square</b> <b>law</b> devices showed that, although there were many devices excelling in one property, there were very few having excellent all round performance. Either a method for improving the performance of existing devices or a completely new device with excellent all round properties would be needed to improve the position, it was decided to attempt to develop a method to improve the properties of existing devices, and the last and major section of the thesis is devoted to the treatment of a method for reducing distortion due to odd powers in the nominal <b>square</b> <b>law</b> transfer function. A large fundamental co-efficient {{is one of the most}} common forms of distortion in these devices. The thoughts leading to the method of improvement are given, with an analysis proving the mathematical possibility. A <b>square</b> <b>law</b> device was constructed using the method and rigorous tests carried out to compare the performance of the device on its own, with that when it is incorporated in the circuit for improving the distortion. The thesis shows that a large improvement in both the accuracy and dynamic range is possible...|$|R
25|$|This remark refers {{among other}} things to Newton's finding, {{supported}} by mathematical demonstration, that if the inverse <b>square</b> <b>law</b> applies to tiny particles, then even a large spherically symmetrical mass also attracts masses external to its surface, even close up, exactly as if all its own mass were concentrated at its center. Thus Newton gave a justification, otherwise lacking, for applying the inverse <b>square</b> <b>law</b> to large spherical planetary masses {{as if they were}} tiny particles.

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} and gravitational inverse <b>square</b> <b>laws</b> are microscopic approximations. I {{suggest that}} they should be modified for elementary particles to use the surface-tosurface separation of the particles rather than the center-to-center separations. For small particles at macroscopic separations, the ratio between the center-to-center distance D and the surface-to-surface distance d, D/d, approaches unity. At microscopic separations, this ratio grows very large. Here I apply this ratio to several microscopic situations and derive the nuclear coupling constants.

50|$|The {{detected}} {{voltage signal}} {{output of the}} Schottky barrier diodes typically used in microwave detectors have a <b>square</b> <b>law</b> relationship to the power being measured and meters are calibrated accordingly. However, as the power increases, the diode deviates significantly from a <b>square</b> <b>law</b> and remains accurate up to an output voltage of only around 5-10 mV.

40|$|Abstract A {{laboratory}} test and several geophysical tests {{conducted in the}} last decades of the 20 th century suggested deviations from the inverse square distance dependence of Newton’s law of gravity. While further work has failed to substantiate these results, renewed interest in inverse <b>square</b> <b>law</b> tests of increased sensitivity has been stimulated by {{a wide range of}} new theoretical ideas. Of particular interest are tests at submillimeter ranges, which could reveal the existence of compact new dimensions accessible only to gravity.
