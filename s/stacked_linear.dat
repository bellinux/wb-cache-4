40|$|The contact map of {{a protein}} fold is a graph that {{represents}} the patterns of contacts in the fold. It is known that the contact map can be decomposed into stacks and queues. RNA secondary structures are special stacks in which the degree of each vertex is at most one and each arc has length at least two. Waterman and Smith derived a formula {{for the number of}} RNA secondary structures of length n with exactly k arcs. Höner zu Siederdissen et al. developed a folding algorithm for extended RNA secondary structures in which each vertex has maximum degree two. An equation for the generating function of extended RNA secondary structures was obtained by Müller and Nebel by using a context-free grammar approach, which leads to an asymptotic formula. In this paper, we consider m-regular <b>linear</b> <b>stacks,</b> where each arc has length at least m and the degree of each vertex is bounded by two. Extended RNA secondary structures are exactly 2 -regular <b>linear</b> <b>stacks.</b> For any m≥ 2, we obtain an equation for the generating function of the m-regular <b>linear</b> <b>stacks.</b> For given m, we can deduce a recurrence relation and an asymptotic formula for the number of m-regular <b>linear</b> <b>stacks</b> on n vertices.

40|$|This book {{focuses on}} {{determination}} of scattering of parallel-fed planar dipole arrays {{in terms of}} reflection and transmission coefficients {{at different levels of}} the array system. In aerospace vehicles, the phased arrays are often in planar configuration. The radar cross section (RCS) of the vehicle is mainly due to its structure and the antennas mounted over it. There can be situation when the signatures due to antennas dominate over the structural RCS of the platform. This necessitates the study towards the reduction and control of antenna/ array RCS. The planar dipole array is considered as a <b>stacked</b> <b>linear</b> dipole array. A systematic, step-by-step approach is used to determine the RCS pattern including the finite dimensions of dipole antenna elements. The mutual impedance between the dipole elements for planar configuration is determined. The scattering till second-level of couplers in parallel feed network is taken into account. The phase shifters are modelled as delay line. All the couplers in the feed network are assumed to be four port devices. It is shown that the array RCS can be reduced considerably for a low observable platform by an optimization of array design parameters even in the presence of mutual coupling.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) planar motor under closed loop control, which can be applied as an ultra precision multi-axis manipulator. In papers presented so far on this topic, a SAW motor is driven in open loop. The slider is manipulated by inducing a repetitive small number of wave periods. In this way a slow slider motion can be generated, which however, is not constant during the cycle time. Although very small steps have been reported for SAW actuators operating in open loop (in the order of 2 nm), the reproducibility of such open loop steering is low in an environment with disturbances. Therefore, one of our focus points is closed loop control of the SAW actuator. To investigate the open- and closed-loop behaviour, two linear SAW motor demonstrators have been developed. Measurements have shown that for conventional actuation a dead band appears in the response of the input signal to the speed of the motor. To overcome this phenomenon, a different way of continuous actuation is presented in this paper, on which a patent has been filed. As a result of the investigations of the linear demonstrators, a closed loop controlled planar SAW motor has been designed, which is under construction and is scheduled to be operational in the spring of 2002. This planar motor concept features a simple and compact construction with low moving mass, since the drive- and guiding-systems are combined, without the need for external bearings, transmissions or guiding systems. Compared to <b>stacked</b> <b>linear</b> systems, a high stiffness and good dynamic behaviour can be achieved.

Most of these systems, starting with Apollo and Soyuz, assign high level functions to var-ious physical spacecraft modules and assemble these in a <b>linear</b> <b>stack.</b> The predominant building block for such systems is the cylinder. Unfortunately, this configuration is inflexi-ble and does not promote reuse of modules over a broad range of missions.

A survey of the modular spacecraft literature and our own analysis reveal that the trun-cated octahedron emerges as the most promising polyhedron-based spacecraft geometry for future application to space exploration. This argument is supported by comparison of various spacecraft geometries with four metrics: volumetric efficiency, launch stowage and packing efficiency, reconfigurability, and stability. In addition, extensible spacecraft design is enabled by this design concept.
