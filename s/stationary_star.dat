40|$|The {{limiting}} {{magnitude of}} an optical camera system {{is an important}} property to understand since {{it is used to}} find the completeness limit of observations. Limiting magnitude depends on the hardware and software of the system, current weather conditions, and the angular speed of the objects observed. If an object exhibits a substantial angular rate during the exposure, its light spreads out over more pixels than the <b>stationary</b> <b>stars.</b> This spreading causes the limiting magnitude to be brighter when compared to the stellar limiting magnitude. The effect, which begins to become important when the object moves a full width at half max during a single exposure or video frame. For targets with high angular speeds or camera systems with narrow field of view or long exposures, this correction can be significant, up to several magnitudes. The stars in an image are often used to measure the limiting magnitude since they are stationary, have known brightness, and are present in large numbers, making the determination of the limiting magnitude fairly simple. In order to transform stellar limiting magnitude to object limiting magnitude, a correction must be applied accounting for the angular velocity. This technique is adopted in meteor and other fast-moving object observations, as the lack of a statistically significant sample of targets makes it virtually impossible to determine the limiting magnitude before the weather conditions change. While the weather is the dominant factor in observing satellites, the limiting magnitude for meteors also changes throughout the night due to the motion of a meteor shower or sporadic source radiant across the sky.

The {{system of equations}} describing radial motions of this sphere in Lagrangian variables reduces to the only nonlinear PDE of the second order in both variables (Lagrangian coordinate and time).

Given initial positions and velocities, we can calculate the forces acting on each object, using Newton’s law of universal gravitation. From the forces we can determine accelerations, and then update the positions and velocities for the next round of calculations. This scheme of computation is known as the n-body method. Perhaps Newton himself could have put it to work if he had had suitable computing machinery. Today we have the computers.

40|$|A {{new class}} of conserved currents, {{describing}} non-gravitational energy-momentum density, is presented. The proposed currents do not require {{the existence of a}} (timelike) Killing vector, and are not restricted to spherically symmetric spacetimes (or similar ones, in which the Kodama vector can be defined). They are based instead on almost-Killing vectors, which could in principle be defined on generic spacetimes.

A mass function is defined in this way for the spherical case, qualitatively different from the Hernández-Misner mass function. An elliptic equation determining the new mass function is derived for the Tolman-Bondi spherically symmetric dust metrics, including a simple solution for the Oppenheimer-Schneider collapse. The equations for the non-symmetric case are shown to be of a mixed elliptic-hyperbolic nature. Comment: 21 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The Hopeman Sandstone, {{which is}} exposed at the {{southern}} edge of the Moray Firth Basin, is composed of a number of aeolian sandstone u its. These units, which have been mapped continuously for 4. 5 km, represent part of an ancient sand sea in which complex star dunes alternated with sand-filled star-dune corridors. The palaeowind regime was complex with prevailing winds from the NNE, secondary winds from the SSE and subordinate winds from the NW. The complex star dunes are represented by two types of deposits: Type I [...] large-scale or giant-scale mainly trough-formed high- to medium-angle cross-bedding, which constitute the slip-face deposits of actively migrating star dunes; and Type II [...] bimodaUy dipping more wedge-shaped large-scale or giant-scale sets, which apparently formed on the opposed flanks of relatively <b>stationary</b> <b>star</b> arm segments. The exposed star arms trend in three main directions being roughly parallel with the palaeowind directions. The dune-dune corridors contain small- and medium-sized crescentic or reversing dunes which frequently overlap the star-dune flanks, interdune flats, and rare ephemeral streams. The palaeowind pattern inferred from the Hopeman Sandstone is very similar to that inferred from early Triassic reversing dune deposits in E Greenland, suggesting th...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new testing {{procedure}} to detect the presence of a cointegrating relationship that follows a globally stationary smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) process. We start from a general VAR model, embed the STAR error correction mechanism (ECM) and then derive the generalised nonlinear STAR error correction model. We provide two operational versions of the tests. Firstly, we obtain the associated nonlinear ECM-based test. Secondly, we generalise the well-known residual-based test for cointegration in linear models by Engle and Granger (1987) and obtain its nonlinear analogue. We derive the relevant asymptotic distributions of the proposed tests. We find via Monte Carlo simulation exercises that our proposed tests have much better power than the Engle and Granger test against the alternative of a globally <b>stationary</b> <b>STAR</b> cointegrating process. In an application to the price-dividend relationship, we also find that our test is able to find cointegration, whereas the linear-based tests fail to do so. Further analysis of impulse response functions of error correction terms (under the alternative) shows that the time taken to recover one half of a one standard deviation shock varies between five and twenty years, whereas the time taken to recover one half of a large shock varies between just 4 to 18 months. This clearly implies that data periods dominated by extreme volatility may display substantial mean reversion of the price-dividend relationship. By contrast this relationship may well look like a unit root when the underlying shocks take on smaller values.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{numerical}} hydrodynamics code using a pseudo-Newtonian formulation {{that uses the}} weak field approximation for the geometry, and a generalized source term for the Poisson equation {{that takes into account}} relativistic effects. The code was designed to treat moderately relativistic systems such as rapidly rotating neutron stars. The hydrodynamic equations are solved using a finite volume method with High Resolution Shock Capturing (HRSC) techniques. We implement several different slope limiters for second order reconstruction schemes and also investigate higher order reconstructions. We use the method of lines (MoL) to convert the mixed spatial-time partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that depend only on time. These ODEs are solved using 2 nd and 3 rd order Runge-Kutta methods. The Poisson equation for the gravitational potential is solved with a multigrid method. In order to confirm the validity of our code, we carry out four different tests including one and two dimensional shock tube tests, <b>stationary</b> <b>star</b> tests of both non-rotating and rotating models and radial oscillation mode tests for spherical stars. In the shock tube tests, the code shows good agreement with analytic solutions which include shocks, rarefaction waves and contact discontinuities. The code is found to be stable and accurate: for example, when solving a stationary stellar model the fractional changes in the maximum density, total mass, and total angular momentum per dynamical time are found to be 3 × 10 ^- 6, 5 × 10 ^- 7 and 2 × 10 ^- 6, respectively.

The study of perturbations of rotating stars is a good example: in this case one can treat the <b>stationary</b> axisymmetric <b>star</b> using a slow rotation approximation (expansion in the angular velocity Ω), so that the background is spherical. Generic perturbations of the rotating star (say parametrized by λ) are then built on top of the axisymmetric perturbations in Ω.

In this paper we analyse the gauge dependence of non–linear perturbations depending on two parameters, derive explicit higher order gauge transformation rules, and define gauge invariance.
