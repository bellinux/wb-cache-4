Some species can breed rapidly under suitable conditions and subsequently become gregarious and migratory.

The largest swarms can cover hundreds of square miles and contain billions of locusts. A locust can eat its own weight (about 2grams) in plants every day.

40|$|The Canterbury Branch of the Entomological Society {{undertook}} a brief re-survey of the insect fauna at the Bankside Scientific Reserve during summer 2009 / 10, thirty-one years {{after an initial}} survey by Lincoln University staff. This tiny reserve (2. 6 ha) supports dryland vegetation, {{which at the time}} of its creation was mainly indigenous. Now that the reserve is surrounded by irrigated pasture, the aim of this assessment was to see whether the indigenous invertebrate component had survived. Both the Canterbury ground beetles, Megadromus antarcticus and Metaglymma monilifer, remained relatively common, but the uncommon tenebrionid, Mimopeus tibialis, endemic to lowland Canterbury appears to have declined in numbers since the original survey. Two specimens of a large rove beetle, Hadrotes wakefieldi, which is known from only a few collections in mid-Canterbury, were collected in pitfall and pan traps in 2009 / 10. The weevil, Nicaeana n. sp., a probable Canterbury endemic, was collected from native broom during both surveys. The flightless longhorn beetles, Ptinosoma ptinoides (a litter feeding species), and Xylotoloides wakefieldi, collected from matagouri, still survive at the site, even though they were not collected in the reserve in 1978 / 79. The rarely collected bent-backed bug, Romna oculata, was common on native broom. The generally montane <b>short-horned</b> <b>grasshopper,</b> Sigaus campestris, was not re-collected. We conclude that a number of species restricted to dryland habitat in Canterbury survive in this reserve. There are very few areas of similar vegetation left on the Canterbury Plains, which have been heavily modified for intensive agriculture. This remnant reserve is therefore significant for conservation of indigenous insects and other invertebrates in spite of its small size...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{combination}} of model-based comparative techniques, disparity analyses and ecomorphological correlations constitutes a powerful method to {{gain insight into}} the evolutionary mechanisms that shape morphological variation and speciation processes. In this study, we used a time-calibrated phylogeny of 70 Iberian species of <b>short-horned</b> <b>grasshoppers</b> (Acrididae) to test for patterns of morphological disparity {{in relation to their}} ecology and phylogenetic history. Specifically, we examined the role of substrate type and level of ecological specialization in driving different aspects of morphological evolution (locomotory traits, chemosensitive organs and cranial morphology) in this recent radiation. Results: We found a bimodal distribution of locomotory attributes corresponding to the two main substrate type guilds (plant vs. ground); plant-perching species tend to exhibit larger wings and thicker femora than those that remain on the ground. This suggests that life form (i. e., substrate type) is an important driving force in the evolution of morphological traits in <b>short-horned</b> <b>grasshoppers,</b> irrespective of ancestry. Substrate type and ecological specialization had no significant influence on head shape, a trait that showed a strong phylogenetic conservatism. Finally, we also found a marginal significant association between the length of antennae and the level of ecological specialization, suggesting that the development of sensory organs may be favored in specialist species. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that even in taxonomic groups showing limited morphological and ecological disparity, natural selection seems to play a more important role than genetic drift in driving the speciation process.

40|$|Population {{fluctuations}} of <b>short-horned</b> <b>grasshoppers</b> {{have been}} linked to the interactions of numerous factors including precipitation, temperature, vegetative growth, latitude, and timing of rainfall events. In some areas, grasshopper populations decline with increased moisture, potentially as a result of direct mortality from raindrops, or from indirect factors including the increase of fungal pathogens. Grasshoppers may also become submerged by flooding events and suffer mortality from drowning. However grasshopper survival of immersion has not been quantified in controlled experiments. We tested nymph and adult survival of immersion of seven species of rangeland grasshoppers. Under laboratory conditions, the LT 50 of adult grasshoppers ranged between 7. 5 and 21 h, while nymphs had an LT 50 of between 3 and 13 h. Survival times indicate that mortality associated with seasonal rainfall is rarely caused by immersion. The significant resistance to hypoxia by these grasshoppers is not strongly correlated with habitat association and may instead be correlated with life history traits associated with overwintering...|$|E

Such selective incorporation of anomalies are claimed in orthopterans 12. The incorporation of anomalies into a genetic system is as much a measure of karyotypic plasticity as it affords the starting point of further evolutionary change.

40|$|Grasshoppers {{are a major}} pest of both {{cultivated}} cropsand rangeland grasses in the world’s semi-arid regions. Areas receiving {{less than}} 750 mm of precipitation {{in the form of}} rain or snow are particularly susceptible. Traditionally drier areas like southern Alberta are more prone to recurring problems, but serious grasshopper infestations can occur in cropland throughout the province. Although the majority of grasshopper damage has been to cereal grains, other crops can be seriously affected. In a more diversified agricultural landscape where cereal crops are often rotated with other cultivars such as canola, lentil and peas, grasshoppers continue to cause significant economic loss in Alberta. Grasshoppers eat 30 to 100 mg of plant material (dry weight) each day. Forage losses are seldom estimated, but {{it has been shown that}} even a moderate infestation of 10 grasshoppers/square metre can typically consume up to 60 per cent of the available forage, depending on the condition of the forage stand. The insects can also consume ALL of the cereal crops, but they usually work the outer edges of fields. The type and extent of crop damage will depend on the type of crop, how well the crop is growing, the number of grasshoppers present, and whether or not adequate cultural and chemical controls are used. Grasshopper description The name “grasshopper ” has been given to a very large and diverse group of insects. All members of the group are characterized by chewing mouth parts, slender bodies, wings that fold lengthwise, large powerful hind legs for jumping and a gradual change in form and size as they develop. Grasshoppers are divided into two major subgroups: the <b>short-horned</b> <b>grasshoppers</b> (Figure 1) and the long-horned grasshoppers, Mormon crickets and katydids (Figure 2). <b>Short-horned</b> <b>grasshoppers</b> are responsible for most of the reported crop losses. As a result, individuals of this subgroup are popularly referred to as “grasshoppers. ” Figure 1. A mature two-striped female grasshopper (Melanoplus bivittatus). Note the distinct two stripes running the full length of the body and the single black stripe on the hind leg. Figure 2.

40|$|Abstract: Being nutritionally rich, <b>short-horned</b> <b>grasshoppers</b> (acridids) {{can be used}} {{to produce}} high quality feed for {{livestock}} industries. For a sustainable supply to the feed manufacturing companies a huge acridid biomass should be obtained at a regular basis. For this purpose acridid farming is going to be essential. But for a successful farming their optimum density per unit space should be obtained. Keeping this in mind the space requirement for mass rearing of two multivoltine grasshopper species i. e. Oxya fuscovittata and Spathosternum prasiniferum prasiniferum were taken under consideration. The experimental jars having 10 X 10 X 25 cm space 3 were used as unit area. Results revealed that for mass culture, the density level 15 for O. fuscovittata and 25 for S. pr. prasiniferum per unit space are most suitable without any mortality. Density level 25 for O. fuscovittata and 35 for S. pr. prasiniferum are good for mass rearing as in these cases mortality rate is very less (i. e. 12 % and 15. 43 % respectively). It was concluded that being smaller in size, more numbers of S. pr. prasiniferum could be kept per unit area compared to O. fuscovittata.
