40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the arguments for}} and against greater use of a sovereign wealth fund in Australia. It argues that the existing Future Fund is unnecessary and that greater use of a sovereign wealth fund would harm Australia’s future prosperity. Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) have become more prominent both in Australia and abroad since the term was first coined in 2005 by State Street’s Andrew Rozanov. A SWF {{can be defined as}} a pool of stated-owned or -controlled financial or other marketable assets designed to finance government activities in either the short or the long term. SWFs can be broadly divided into pension and non-pension funds. The growth in state-controlled pension funds reflects government policies that have increasingly sought to anticipate the fiscal implications of ageing populations. The global commodity price boom since 2003 has increased the role of commodity <b>stabilisation</b> <b>funds</b> in commodity exporting countries, particularly oil-producing states. The accumulation of large foreign exchange reserves as a result of managed exchange rate regimes in East Asia, particularly China, has also seen SWFs emerge as adjuncts to the traditional reserve asset management role of central banks...|$|R
40|$|Dutch disease {{occurs when}} {{government}} revenue from a booming non-renewable natural resource export sector {{is spent on}} recurrent domestic activities. Dutch disease amplifies the cyclical influence of commodity prices and inflicts adjustment costs on the economy through movements in the exchange rate. Revenue funds, such as revenue <b>stabilisation</b> <b>funds</b> or sovereign wealth funds, can help avoid this problem by either investing revenue abroad until downturns or holding revenue abroad indefinitely. Through an investigation of six open, natural resource exporting countries, revenue funds were found to delink exchange rate movements from the terms of trade. Although {{it is unlikely that}} revenue funds are the sole cause of this effect, revenue funds are considered a useful tool for, but not essential to, responsible fiscal management. Western Australia has been found to have Dutch disease. Recurrent government expenditure is vulnerable to decreases in royalty receipts. High levels of mineral exports are partly responsible for the high Australian dollar. Revenue funds are a potential policy tool if the Western Australian government decides to limit the impact of export prices on Australia’s exchange rate. As this is unlikely to be an objective for a state government, it should instead be seen as an added benefit to countercyclical or sustainable fiscal policies. In this case, only a sovereign wealth fund is considered appropriate at the state level and could be used to manage royalties sustainably, reduce movements in Australia’s exchange rate and gain greater fiscal autonomy for the states.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{implications}} of the unemployment insurance (UI) financing system on wage levels and employment when labour markets are unionised and the revenues of the firms are stochastic. We use the basic monopoly union approach of wage and employment determination and assume that unemployment benefits are financed by employees’ UI contributions to the union’s UI fund and by the government’s tax revenue. The main focus of this paper is on the effects of UI buffer funding on employment fluctuations. We show that, compared with the pay- as-you-go financing system, buffer funding stabilises the economy by decreasing employment fluctuations where wages are flexible. If wages are rigid, buffer funding stabilises net wage variations, but has hardly any effect on employment fluctuations. unemployment insurance, unions, <b>stabilisation,</b> buffer <b>funding...</b>|$|R
40|$|Economic {{conditions}} which had favoured Russia’s development suddenly changed in mid- 2008. The Russian economy was hit, {{on the one}} hand, by a drastic slump in oil prices (which fell from nearly US$ 150 to US$ 50 between July 2008 and January 2009), {{and on the other}} by the outflow of investors (a net of US$ 130 billion of capital left Russia {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008). Within several months, the financial crisis became an economic crisis affecting the entire economy. The financial reserves accumulated in times of prosperity (more than US$ 162 billion in the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>funds</b> and nearly US$ 598 billion in the currency and gold reserve) alleviated the negative impact of the crisis, although this failed to prevent the deep declines in macroeconomic indicators. Russia is one of the states most severely affected by the crisis. In the first half of 2009, its GDP fell by 10. 4 % compared to the same period in the previous year, while industrial production dropped by nearly 15 %, and a decrease in investments of over 18 % was reported. The poor economic performance has strongly affected the Russian budget, which reported a deficit for the first time in ten years in 2009. During the first year of the crisis (August 2008 – September 2009), Russia’s financial reserves were seriously reduced as a result of the government’s anti-crisis policy and interventions from the central bank: the reserve fund decreased by nearly 45 % to US$ 76 billion, and the central bank’s reserves shrunk by nearly US$ 200 billion to US$ 409 billion. Meanwhile, however, the money in the National Welfare Fund, which had been intended almost entirely to subsidise the Pensions Fund between 2010 and 2015, rose almost three-fold (to US$ 90 billion). According to government forecasts, the money from the reserve fund is also supposed to be spent fully in 2010. The financial crisis has triggered a dynamic outflow of capital from the Russian market. So-called speculative capital was the first to demonstrate the lack of confidence in the Russian market. In the first half of 2009, the growth rate of long-term investments also decreased noticeably, although no spectacular withdrawal of direct investments from Russia has been observed. The economic crisis has also halted the foreign expansion of Russian private capital, while state-owned capital strengthened its position as an investor. Russia’s raw materials companies continue to be the main category of foreign investors; however, new technologies are gaining prominence as the second main direction of Russian investments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{two basic}} {{issues related to}} technological innovation and climate stabilisation objectives: i) Can innovation policies be effective in stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations? ii) To what extent can innovation policies complement carbon pricing (taxes or permit trading) and improve the economic efficiency of a mitigation policy package? To answer these questions, we use an integrated assessment model with multiple externalities and an endogenous representation of technical progress in the energy sector. We evaluate a range of innovation policies, both as a stand-alone instrument and {{in combination with other}} mitigation policies. Even under fairly optimistic assumptions about the funding available for, and the returns to R&D, our analysis indicates that innovation policies alone are unlikely to stabilise global concentration and temperature. The efficiency gains of combining innovation and carbon pricing policies are found to reach about 10 % for a stabilisation target of 535 ppm CO 2 eq.

40|$|Fiscal {{policy choices}} have a {{particularly}} {{significant impact on}} economic performance in oil-exporting countries, owing {{to the importance of}} the oil sector in the economy and the fact that in most countries oil revenues accrue to the government. At the same time, fiscal policy in oil-centred economies s facing specific challenges, both in the long run, as regards intergenerational equity and fiscal sustainability, and in the short run, as regards macroeconomic stabilisation and fiscal planning. Institutional responses to the specific fiscal challenges in oil-exporting countries involve conservative oil price assumptions in the budget, the establishment of oil <b>stabilisation</b> and savings <b>funds</b> and fiscal rules. Fiscal policy in most oil-exporting countries has been expansionary over the past years in the wake of high oil prices. Fiscal expansion has added to inflationary pressure, and monetary policy has been constrained in tackling inflation as a result of prevailing exchange rate regimes. While, in this context, fiscal policy is the major tool for macroeconomic stabilisation, it has faced competing objectives and considerations. Cyclical considerations would have warranted fiscal restraint, but, in times of high oil prices, pressures to increase public spending have been mounting. Such pressures stem from primarily distribution-related considerations, development-related spending needs (e. g. in the areas of physical and social infrastructure) and international considerations in the context of, for example, global imbalances. The sharp fall in oil prices since mid- 2008 has brought to the fore a different question – whether oil exporters can sustain spending levels reached in previous years.

40|$|The European Commission {{released}} a staff working paper on commodity dependence and poverty {{in developing countries}} in August 2003. From its analysis {{it is apparent that}} the problem of agricultural commodity dependency is primarily a problem which afflicts ACP countries. For two commodities - coffee and cotton - dependent African countries are all LDCs with a low human development index. Similarly for cocoa the main dependent countries are LDCs or low-income countries. The paper acknowledges that 'lower export prices mean reduced farm incomes, lower agricultural wages or even unemployment', which then feeds into a cycle of low investment and stagnant productivity. 'Lower export incomes also have an effect on government revenues' which 'means reduced budgetary resources for poverty -reducing activities such as health and education'. It notes that falls in export earnings also affect the balance of payments, putting pressure on debt servicing. The paper reviews the challenges faced and outlines 'a set of actions that could be taken by these countries at the national and international level, to address these issues in the longer term'. The key challenges identified include: 'long term declining price trends; short term volatility; international market concentration and integration; market reforms in producing countries and the over-dependence on traditional primary commodities, such as coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas and sugar'. In response to long-term declining prices the paper recommends that steps be taken to increase competitiveness, profit margins and the share of consumer prices that goes to producers. It does not favour the revival of international commodity agreements, maintaining that the 'conditions are not in place that would allow such schemes to be successful'. On market concentration it calls for more reflection on 'how to balance the economic powers of large multinational and small producers in developing countries, whilst retaining incentive to improve flows of FDI', but makes no proposals. On domestic market reforms it argues for close collaboration between government and producer organisations including a 'more active role for governments' so as to create an enabling environment for the domestic private sector. The paper notes the challenge of diversification and highlights 'the lack of trade-related capacity in many developing countries' as a major hurdle. It emphasises the importance of developing production for local and regional markets as an important vehicle for diversification. Overall the paper argues that 'commodity-dependent countries need to analyse their own situation and devise more proactive strategies to address the crises facing their key economic sectors. An important component of this, it is argued, is to analyse the 'potential international constraints to the development of their commodity sectors' and to argue their case for change in appropriate fora. Comment: Singularly absent from the Commission paper were any proposals for the re-establishment of a coherent EU response to the consequences of commodity price declines. This is a remarkable oversight given the singular failure of the new FLEX instrument, which replaced the old STABEX scheme. While reference is made to <b>stabilisation</b> <b>funds</b> which sought to stabilise prices by means of buffer-stock intervention, little reference is made to the role that STABEX transfers played in financing these mechanisms in certain ACP countries. Significantly, while the commodities looked at include sugar and cotton, in analysing declining price trends little reference is made to the impact of EU sugar-sector policies since 1970 on declining world market prices, or the impact of US cotton-sector policies on declining cotton prices. Indeed, the only reference to cotton, sugar and rice is when the paper observes somewhat obscurely that 'most large international actors could intensify their efforts to promote policy coherence'. Given the concentration of market {{power in the hands of}} the coffee roasters, where four coffee roasters dominate the global market, the EU could use its existing competition legislation to ascertain the extent to which these four companies abuse their dominant market position in relation to coffee growers. This could act as a useful basis for promoting the objective of ensuring that coffee producers get an increased proportion of the final sale value of the finished product. Ironically, diversification in some countries (Zambia, Mozambique, Ethiopia) is compounding the problems of existing producers (e. g. in the sugar sector). In addition some areas of diversification to serve regional markets (e. g. Ugandan production of wheat) run into the problem of market distortions generated by agricultural support programmes of OECD countries. What is more, efforts to diversify (e. g. citrus production in Swaziland) can be undermined by the harmonisation of EU sanitary and phytosanitary measures, which increase non-tariff obstacles to trade and the risks associated with exporting to the EU market. The Commission paper observes that 'a key condition for success is that the market targeted by diversification must be a growing and dynamic one'. However if it is a growing and dynamic market it is likely to be targeted by established OECD producers and other commodity-dependent developing countries who are seeking to diversify, leading to over supply and declining prices (e. g. the emerging trend in the cut-flower sector). Regarding the question of moving up the value chain, the paper notes that 'smaller commodity-producing countries are at a comparative disadvantage to enter into processing', since increasingly strict and sophisticated market requirements are faced which require large scale investment and high volumes of throughput. The refusal to consider a revival of international commodity agreements on the grounds that the 'conditions are not in place that would allow such schemes to be successful' assumes that the conditions cannot be created. This is challenged in a new book jointly published by the CTA and Zed Press, Stolen Fruit, by Peter Robbins, who argues that on the contrary there are provisions within the WTO itself, currently being followed up under the leadership of Kenya, that would allow price interventions in cases like coffee which have seen a fall in real prices to a seventh of their 1980 value.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the Venezuelan oil sector. The ‘oil economy’ {{represents}} the singular most determining variable in {{the political economy of}} Venezuela. The thesis challenges the view that oil, per se, has been some sort of a ‘curse’ over the country. Instead, this thesis aims to highlight the fact that other characteristics of the political system have influenced the way Venezuelans have dealt with their oil wealth. The thesis presents empirical evidence that the management of the oil industry and oilrelated income in the three decades following nationalisation of oil in 1975 became politicised. Politicisation occurred {{despite the fact that the}} political elite was aware of the danger that this might happen. Political elites embarked upon designing institutions to try to prevent this outcome. The institutions themselves were not in principle badly designed, and the thesis shows that there was nothing so inherently wrong with their design that they were unworkable. What was lacking was the political will to make them work, and evidence of this can be seen across two dimensions. One relates to the fact that all institutional forms studied – the holding company PDVSA, the Investment, <b>Stabilisation</b> and Development <b>Funds</b> – all ended up politicised. The other relates to the fact that an essentially similar pattern of politicisation can be seen across a whole series of different Venezuelan governments. In this sense the Chávez government has been an exercise in continuity and not in rupture. The thesis analyses two concrete aspects of the relationship between the Venezuelan State and oil. It scrutinises oil policy in Venezuela over the three decades following the nationalisation of the oil industry in 1975. The research focuses on the institutional arrangements (i. e. the ‘rules of the game’) concerning, first, the spending of the revenue which the Venezuelan State obtains from oil exports and second, theexercise of political authority and the use of institutional resources to control PDVSA and define its policy guidelines. This thesis facilitates a deeper understanding of the politicisation that has occurred in Venezuelan political economy at critical points in the relationship between the State and the oil sector. These insights contribute, in turn, to a better understanding of contemporary Venezuelan problems...|$|R

5000|$|On 24 March 1939, Saracoğlu told Massigli that Britain and France {{should do}} more to oppose German {{influence}} in the Balkans, which was followed on 29 March by an offer of a Franco-Turkish alliance which would go into effect provided the British also joined. In April 1939, the deputy Soviet Foreign Commissar Vladimir Potemkin {{during a visit to}} Turkey told Massigli that the aim of Soviet foreign policy was to bring into line a [...] "peace front" [...] to oppose German expansionism comprising Britain, France, the Soviet Union and Turkey. In 1939, Massigli was heavily preoccupied with competition with the German Ambassador Franz von Papen in an effort to secure Turkish adherence to the Allied side in the event of war breaking out. As part of the effort to increase French influence on the Turkish government, Massigli arranged for the visit of General Maxime Weygand to Turkey in early May 1939, which was made into a state event. During Weygand's visit, the Turkish President İsmet İnönü told the French that he believed that the best way of stopping Germany was an alliance of Turkey, the Soviet Union, France and Britain; that if such an alliance came into being, the Turks would allow Soviet ground and air forces onto their soil; and that he wanted a major programme of French military aid to modernise the Turkish armed forces. Massigli was most disappointed when the British sent a mere brigadier instead of an admiral to offer military aid to the Turks, remarking sorely that [...] "The Turks respect the Royal Navy; they no longer believe in the British Army." [...] In July 1939 Massigli argued that if the British and French were able to offer a <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund</b> for the Turkish pound, it would undercut German economic influence in Turkey and tie Turkey to the West. Later in July 1939, Massigli was able to play a major part in arranging for French arms shipments to Turkey and later in August to have an Anglo-French <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund</b> created to help with Turkey's economic problems. The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939 undid much of Massigli's effects as the Turks always believed that it was essential to have the Soviet Union as an ally to counter Germany, and the signing of the German-Soviet pact undercut completely the assumptions behind Turkish security policy. Through Massigli was often hampered by his poor relations with Bonnet, the efforts of the Les Syriens, and the stingily attitude of the French Treasury towards supporting Turkey, the British historian D.C. Watt argued that Massigli was an outstanding able ambassador who did much to successfully advance French interests in Turkey in 1939.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of coffee booms on the money market, the real exchange rate, and the business cycle in Colombia. Chapter 2 presents {{an overview of the}} coffee sector in the country, including a brief description of its macroeconomic role, and unique institutional structure. Chapter 3 investigates, from a simulation perspective, two empirical difficulties that arise in econometric modelling when using quarterly data, as is done in chapters 4 and 5. The first practical concern is whether to conduct the econometric analysis on data that have been subjected to seasonal adjustment or in terms of unadjusted data. The simulation results provide a justification for using seasonally unadjusted data, as the use of filters reduces the power of the Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron cointegration tests. The second difficulty concerns an empirical regularity encountered when analysing the Colombian quarterly series of money supply and GDP, both of which exhibit a structural break (or change) in the seasonal pattern. We find that these structural breaks bias both unit root and seasonal root tests, so that new critical values must be tabulated allowing for a change in either the level and/or the seasonal pattern of the underlying series. Chapter 4 examines the monetary consequences of coffee booms. The theoretical work on this subject shows that under a regime of fixed exchange rates, export booms affect both the demand and the supply for money. Within this theoretical framework, we assess whether the coffee booms of {{the second half of the}} seventies and mid eighties led to excess money supply in Colombia. We find a direct association between coffee export booms and excess money supply, implying that external disturbances jeopardise the ability of the economic authorities to carry out successful monetary policy. Chapter 5 uses the Johansen procedure to estimate a real exchange rate determination model for Colombia. We find one cointegrating vector, which can be thought of as a long-run real exchange rate equation. The deviations of the real exchange rate from its long-run equilibrium relationship, after correcting for the short-run dynamics, are interpreted as a measure of real exchange rate misalignment. The simulation performance of the model, during the period of estimation and three years into the future, is particularly good, with the simulated real exchange rate reproducing the general long-run behaviour of the actual series. Chapter 6 develops an intertemporal disequilibrium model in order to analyse {{the effects of}} temporary, anticipated, and permanent coffee price shocks on a small open economy under Keynesian unemployment. Our results indicate that a coffee price boom (whether temporary, anticipated or permanent) increases nontradable output in the short and long run (a similar result is obtained when we discuss other disequilibrium regimes). The basic model is then extended by including a government sector that administers a coffee price <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund,</b> and by allowing capital market imperfections. Our results indicate that when the government is able to borrow on more favourable terms in international capital markets than households, the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund</b> neutralises part of the short-term effect of a temporary coffee price boom. On the other hand, when the government and the private sector borrow on the same terms, the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund</b> turns out to be redundant. ...|$|E
40|$|An intense {{discussion}} {{is taking place}} in international political economy on the influence of economic ideas on institutional change. Case studies so far have, however, mainly focused on the Western industrialised countries and research seems to be biased towards cases in which new ideas caused lasting institutional change. The present paper addresses these two shortcomings by analysing the case of the Russian <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Fund</b> (SF). This case is an example both of the impact of global ideas on a non-Western emerging country and of a ‘near miss’ in the sense that imported neoliberal ideas failed to assert themselves enduringly. Paradoxically, it can be shown how the neoliberally based idea of the SF even contributed to the return to Soviet patterns of industrial policy. The main reason for this, we argue, is that the Fund's implementation was not preceded by economic and political debates. Accordingly, the imported institution of the SF had to be filled with ideational content after its implementation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{and estimates}} a small macroeconomic {{model of the}} Russian economy. The model is tailored to analyze {{the impact of the}} oil price, the exchange rate, private sector confidence and fiscal policy on economic performance. The model does very well in explaining Russia’s recent economic history in the period 1995 - 2004. Simulations suggest that the Russian economy is vulnerable to downward oil price shocks. We substantiate two mechanisms that mitigate the economic effects of oil price shocks, namely the stabilisation brought by the Oil <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Fund</b> and the Dutch disease effect. The negative effect of a shock in private sector confidence on real GDP is comparable to the effect of an oil price shock, although the transmission of both shocks runs along different channels. The fiscal policies of the Putin administration temper economic fluctuations caused by oil price shocks, but {{it remains to be seen}} whether these policies will be continued.

40|$|With {{two very}} large mining {{projects}} {{expected to reach}} full production this decade, Mongolia is entering a commodity boom. History teaches us that commodity revenues offer unique opportunities for development but can also depress long-term economic prospects by increasing macroeconomic volatility, reducing incentives to invest in physical and human capital and undermining economic and political institutions. This paper surveys what Mongolia can do, building on reform steps it has already taken, to avoid a “resource trap”. It argues that (i) cash transfers {{to the general population}} should be linked directly to the performance of the underlying mining assets to create a domestic constituency for good governance in the mining sector; (ii) social spending should be de-linked from resource revenues, better targeted and fully incorporated into the budget; (iii) macroeconomic volatility could be reduced by operationalising the fiscal <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund,</b> issuing GDP-indexed debt instruments, and through financial sector reforms; and (iv) major infrastructure and industrial development projects should seek private sector co-investments to ensure that public money is well spent...|$|E
40|$|Elements of {{the scheme}} In May, the German {{government}} has {{decided on the}} draft of a law for establishing so-called “Bad Banks ” (Bundesregierung 2009). The draft has the following core elements: 1. Banks (or financial holdings or their subsidiaries) may establish a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to which they can transfer structured assets – such as asset backed securities (ABS), collateral debt obligations (CDO) or collateralized loan obligations (CLO). These assets must have been acquired before Jan. 1, 2009. 2. In exchange, the transferring bank (from now on just “bank”) receives securities of the SPV which are guaranteed by the German state through the Financial Market <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Fund</b> (“SoFFin”). The bank pays a guarantee fee to SoFFin. 3. As a rule, the transfer of assets is {{made on the basis}} of 90 per cent of the book value in the bank’s balance sheet. 4. The bank has to supply information on the current time value of the asset, which has to be confirmed by an independent expert and by the banking supervisory authority. On the basis of this information and additional risk considerations, SoFFin determines a fundamenta...|$|E
40|$|We employ OLS {{analysis}} on a VAR Model {{to test the}} “commodity currency” hypothesis of the Rand (i. e. that the currency moves in sympathy with commodity prices) and examine the associated causality using nominal data between 1996 and 2010. We {{address the question of}} cointegration using the Engle-Granger test. We find that level series of both assets are difference stationary but not cointegrated. Further, we find the two variables negatively related with strong and significant causality running from commodity prices to the exchange rate and not vice versa, implying exogeneity to the determination of commodity prices with respect to the nominal exchange rate. The strength of the relationship is significantly weaker than other OECD commodity currencies. We surmise that the relationship is dynamic over time owing to the portfolio-rebalance argument and the Commodity Terms of Trade (CTT) effect {{and in the absence of}} an error correction mechanism, this disconnect may be prolonged. For commodity and currency market participants, this implies that while futures and forward commodity prices may be useful leading indicators of future currency movements, the price risk management strategies may need to be recalibrated over time. For monetary policy makers, to manage commodity price risk and concentration risk on the country’s exports, we suggest establishment of a selfinsurance scheme such as a Commodity <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Fund</b> established in Chile in 1985...|$|E
40|$|Future {{membership}} of CEE {{countries in the}} euro zone highlights the risk of external asymmetric demand shocks due to too strong a dependence on one sector or one customer country. The {{purpose of this article}} is to build two indicators of exposure to shocks—sector-based and geographical—taking into account the symmetry of the export structures of a future member with the EMU and the trade openness of the future member. This enables us to draw up a classification of the CEE countries according to fulfillment of the Kenen criterion, revised and then transposed to the geographical variety of exports. The results, compared with those of the two countries in the EMU which are most sensitive to sector-based and geographical shocks (Finland and Ireland), testify to a generally pronounced exposure to shocks. An inventory of the pairs 'country/branch' and 'country/destination' liable to be at the origin of shocks with strong macroeconomic impact shows that Bulgaria and Slovakia, and to an even greater extent Estonia and Latvia, are exposed to major risks. In so far as Bulgaria and Latvia's real convergence process with the euro zone seems scarcely to have started, these two economies might consider postponing EMU membership or creating a cyclical <b>stabilisation</b> <b>fund</b> on joining. This recommendation contradicts the endogenous OCA theory, which is put forward when intra-industry trade intensifies. However, an increase in the share of intra-industry trade between a CEE country and the EMU does not necessarily entail less exposure to the shocks studied. ...|$|E
