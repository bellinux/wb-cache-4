40|$|Soil maximum {{available}} water content (MaxAWC) {{is a key}} parameter in land surface models (LSMs). However, being difficult to measure, this parameter is usually uncertain. This study assesses the feasibility of using a 15 -year (1999 – 2013) time series of satellite-derived low-resolution observations of leaf area index (LAI) to estimate MaxAWC for rainfed croplands over France. LAI interannual variability is simulated using the CO 2 -responsive version of the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA) LSM for various values of MaxAWC. Optimal value is then selected by using (1)  a simple inverse modelling technique, comparing simulated and observed LAI and (2)  a more complex method consisting in integrating observed LAI in ISBA through a land data assimilation system (LDAS) and minimising LAI analysis increments. The evaluation of the MaxAWC estimates from both methods is done using simulated annual maximum above-ground biomass (B ag) and <b>straw</b> <b>cereal</b> grain yield (GY) values from the Agreste French agricultural statistics portal, for 45 administrative units presenting {{a high proportion of}} straw cereals.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to present {{original}} results about nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium distribution in <b>straw</b> <b>cereal</b> grains from Dobrogea region depending on the soils characteristics. In order to achieve this aim, studies on the nutrients content in soils from small farms located in Mereni, Independenta and Lumina (Constanta County) together with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium content in grains of different cereals cultivated on the above mentioned soils have been done. Samples of soils, barley, wheat and rye grains have been collected; for the preparation of cereals and soils samples and their chemical characterization standard protocols were followed. Nitrogen was determined by acidimetric titration, phosphorus using molecular absorption spectrometry and potassium by atomic emission spectrometry. Nutrients concentrations in cereal grains and soils have been found in accordance with the means reported values of occurrence. The nutrients transfer coefficients from soil to cereal grains generally increase in the order: nitrogen (8 - 15), potassium (15 - 66), phosphorus (76 - 250) in all studied sampling sites with some exceptions depending probably on the specific equilibrium involved in the nutrients absorption by roots...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Progress towards {{converting}} from a geology-based to a biology-based economy depends critically {{on improving}} {{the efficiency and}} flexibility of biomass conversion through improvements in both thermochemical and biochemical processes. Improvements in the latter will benefit greatly from development of novel, adaptively evolved, hybrid yeast strains capable of aggressively fermenting sugars at elevated temperatures and ethanol concentrations from pretreated forest and agricultural residuals. Background: For inexpensive, large-scale bioethanol production, producers will need to develop microbial systems that can ferment biomass from feedstocks such as corn stover, corn fiber, rice <b>straw,</b> <b>cereal</b> straw, bagasse, forestry waste products, and possibly switch grass (NREL, 2002). Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the organism of choice {{for the development of}} such a system. While S. cerevisiae is able to ferment the hexose sugars in cellulose to ethanol, it normally lacks the ability to produce ethanol by the fermentation of pentose sugars, xylose and L-arabinose, present in hemicellulose. Although it cannot utilize xylose as a sole carbon source, S. cerevisiae can catabolize this substrate, albeit slowly (van Zyl et al., 1989), as it possesses the genes that encode the key steps in xylose metabolism. S. cerevisiae also has an endogenous xylulose kinase which converts xylulose to a compound that can enter a pathway eventually allowing for energy production and growth, and the evolution of CO 2 and ethanol (Ho 1989, Batt 1986). Wild-type S. cerevisiae contains all the necessary enzymes to allow growth on xylose as a sole carbon source...|$|E

In a first trial made at the site ''Longs Tours'', the organic fertilizers treatment schemes had been repeatedly applied in the past since 30 years, according to a 3 years rotation cycle. The following organic fertilizers treatment regimens were compared: treatment (1) no organic fertilizer at all; treatment (2) cow manure; treatment (3) pig slurry + green manure + crop wastes; treatment (4) green manure + crop wastes; treatment (5) <b>straw</b> <b>cereal</b> wastes alone.

The following organic fertilizers treatment regimens [...] which are the main ones used in the agronomy practice [...] were compared: Treatment 1 : no organic fertilizer at all; treatment 2 : 40 tons cow manure ha- 1; treatment 3 : 40 tons pig slurry ha- 1 + green manure + crop wastes; treatment 4 : green manure + crop wastes; treatment 5 : <b>straw</b> <b>cereal</b> wastes alone. A sugar beet crop was sown in April 1991, 1 kg aldicarb ha- 1 being applied in granulates in the sowing furrow. During the 2. 9 first crop months, the soil half-lives of {{the sum of the}} insecticide S(-) +SO(-) +SO 2 -aldicarb in the sowing line in the 0 - 25 cm surface soil layer were 21. 6, 44. 4, 39. 6, 35. 7, and 30. 3 days in the treatments 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 treated plots, respectively. The organic fertilizers soil treatments thus increased the persistence of the total insecticide compounds soil concentrations, and probably also the insecticide protection efficiencies.

High energetic value recovery from winery industry {{is an attractive}} economic solution to stimulate new sustainable process. Approach of this work is based about physic and biological treatment with grape stalks and grape marc to increase polysaccharides components of cell wall and energetic availability of this by-products. Grape stalks for example have {{a high percentage of}} lignin and cellulose and can’t be used, whitout pretreatment, for an anaerobic digestion process.

A screening of specifically industrial enzymatic complex for the hydrolysis lignocellulosic biomass were tested using the principal polysaccharides component of the vegetal cells. Combined thermo-mechanical and enzymatic pretreatment improve substrates conversion in batch test fermentation experiment. The conservation of the grape stalks, at temperature above 0 °C, allow the growth of spontaneus fermentation that reduce their polysaccharides content so had investigated anarobic condition of conservation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{implementation}} of adaptation strategies {{of agriculture and}} forestry to climate change is conditioned by {{the knowledge of the}} impacts of climate change on the vegetation cycle and of the associated uncertainties. Using the same generic Land Surface Model (LSM) to simulate the response of various vegetation types is more straightforward than using several specialized crop and forestry models, as model implementation differences are difficult to assess. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the potential of a LSM to address this issue. Using the SURFEX (“Surface Externalisée”) modeling platform, we produced and analyzed 150 -yr (1950 – 2100) simulations of the biomass of four vegetation types (rainfed <b>straw</b> <b>cereals,</b> rainfed grasslands, broadleaf and needleleaf forests) and of the soil water content associated to each of these vegetation types over France. Statistical methods were used to quantify the impact of climate change on simulated phenological dates. The duration of soil moisture stress periods increases everywhere in France, especially for grasslands with, on average, an increase of 9 days per year in near-future (NF) conditions and 36 days per year in distant-future (DF) conditions. For all the vegetation types, leaf onset and the annual maximum LAI occur earlier. For <b>straw</b> <b>cereals</b> in the Languedoc-Provence-Corsica area, NF leaf onset occurs 18 days earlier and 37 days earlier in DF conditions, on average. On the other hand, local discrepancies are simulated for the senescence period (e. g. earlier in western and southern France for broadleaf forests, slightly later in mountainous areas of eastern France) for both NF and DF. Changes in phenological dates are more uncertain in DF than in NF conditions in relation to differences in climate models, especially for forests. Finally, it is shown that while changes in leaf onset are mainly driven by air temperature, longer soil moisture stress periods trigger earlier leaf senescence over most of France. This shows that developing in situ soil moisture networks could help monitoring the long-term impacts of climate change...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of wood residues in the removal of nutrients (ammonium-N; NH 4 -N) from nutrient-rich (NH 4 -N) waters. The water holding capacity of the wood materials was also determined. Carried out at Rothamsted Research, North Wyke, UK, this controlled laboratory experiment tested two wood residues; in length, one being 1 - 2 cm and the other from 150 µm (microns) to 9. 5 mm. Although a wide range of studies have shown the effectiveness and performance of various absorbent materials as animal beddings, such as <b>straw</b> (<b>cereal</b> straw), woodchip (sawdust, bark or wood shavings), bracken and rushes, only few have focused on the NH 4 -N sorption/desorption capacity. The depuration capacity of wood residues from nutrient-rich effluents such as those from cattle bedded on woodchip or straw will be controlled by processes such as sorption (adsorption-absorption) and desorption of nutrients. Studies have reported the nitrogen removal capacity of woodchip materials and biochar from woodchip as well as removal of NH 4 +-N from domestic and municipal wastewater, farm dirty water, landfill and industry effluents. These studies have observed that the mechanism of removal of nitrogen is by either increasing NO 3 [...] N removal form leachate by enhancing N 2 O losses via denitrification (biochar as carbon source for denitrifiers) or by decreasing NH 4 +-N in leachate through adsorption to negatively charged sites. Results showed that although the cation exchange capacity (CEC) and surface area (SA) are both fundamental properties of adsorbent materials, no correlation was found with CEC and adsorption or desorption. Nor did changes in pH appear to be sufficiently important to cause changes in CEC. For this reason, osmotic pressure appeared to be a more predominant parameter controlling processes of adsorption and desorption of NH 4 +-N in both wood residues. Thus, wood residues high in NH 4 +-N should be avoided, as they could have an opposite effect in the adsorption of nutrients from nutrient-rich effluents. The results also showed that some wood residues (G 30) had great capacity to adsorb NH 4 +-N to levels up to nearly 90...|$|E
40|$|Use of {{processed}} biofuels (pellets, briquettes) {{has greatly}} increased in Sweden in recent decades, mainly to replace fossil fuels in large boilers, e. g. in coal powder boilers. More recently, the demand from private households and residential heating systems has also increased, mainly due to conversion from fossil heating oil. This {{increased interest in}} pellets and briquettes for heating is beginning to cause a shortage of the traditional raw materials, sawdust and wood shavings, and therefore attention is turning to {{using a variety of}} agricultural products as raw material. Such raw materials include cultivated energy crops and wastes and by-products from agriculture. This study describes the typical systems currently used for production of pellets and briquettes and investigates the possibility of using energy crops (Salix, reed canary-grass and hemp) and various wastes and by-products from processing of farm products (<b>straw,</b> <b>cereal</b> screenings, rape-seed meal and distiller’s waste) as raw materials. Previous experiences of pelleting and briquetting of these raw materials are reviewed in order to comprehensively identify possible combustion problems that may occur. On the basis of the results obtained, scenarios for possible production systems in a five-year perspective are presented and the costs and energy demands for these systems calculated. These future scenarios include largescale plants and micro-scale plants, as well as static and mobile equipment. The five main conclusions from the study are: - The farm raw materials of greatest interest for large-scale production are pelleted Salix and reed canary-grass. They have competitive prices and acceptable fuel properties and could be mixed with sawdust in existing large-scale pelleting factories in Sweden. - Straw has low production costs but can cause serious ash-related problems. Hemp has too high production costs to be of commercial interest, while distiller’s waste and rape-seed meal currently have a higher alternative value when used as protein feed. Cereal screenings can be a suitable raw material provided that they only make up a minor proportion in mixtures with other more problem-free raw materials. - The scale of production has a great influence on production costs. In large-scale plants, the machinery and equipment, etc. are used much more efficiently than in smaller plants, which results in lower costs. - Small-scale pelleting, both static and mobile, requires cheap raw materials and a high through-put to be profitable. In most cases, briquetting would be more commercially viable. - The energy consumption in manufacturing pellets from dry farm by-products is generally no higher than when moist sawdust is used as the raw material. More energy is admittedly required for cultivation and transport of farm by-products, but since {{there is no need for}} drying the total energy consumption is often lower. However, wet raw materials such as fresh Salix and distiller’s waste can increase the total energy consumption...|$|E

Although deployment of first generation biofuels {{has been the}} major response to meeting these targets {{they are subject to}} wide debate on their sustainability leading to the development of second generation technologies which use lignocellulosic feedstocks. Second generation biofuel can be subdivided into those from dedicated bioenergy crops (DESGB), e. g. miscanthus, or those from co-products (CPSGB) such as <b>cereal</b> <b>straw.</b> Potential supply of <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> as a feedstock for CPSGB's is uncertain in England due to the difficulty in obtaining data and the uncertainty in current estimates. An on-farm survey of 249 farms (Cereal, General Cropping and Mixed) in England was performed and linked with Farm Business Survey data to estimate current straw use and potential straw availability.

In England there is a potential <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> supply of 5. 27  Mt from arable farm types; 3. 82  Mt are currently used and 1. 45  Mt currently chopped and incorporated.

Second generation biofuels offer potential to contribute towards this target with <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> representing a potentially large feedstock source. From an on-farm survey of 240 arable farmers, timeliness of crop establishment and benefits of nutrient retention from straw incorporation were cited as reasons for straw incorporation. However, two-thirds (one-third) of farmers would supply wheat (barley) straw for bioenergy. The most popular contract length and continuous length of straw supply was either 1 or 3 years.

40|$|The present {{amount of}} biomass used for heat, {{and to a}} smaller extent {{electricity}} production, is already considerable in several European countries but the potential unused in Europe is even higher. Combustion is the most mature conversion technology utilized for biomass. The systems addressed in this paper are plants with a nominal boiler capacity greater 0. 5 MWth. The main combustion technologies used for these systems are underfeed stoker furnaces, moving grate firings (over-bed stoker fired units), bubbling and circulating fluidized beds. The most important biomass fuels are sawdust, wood chips, bark, <b>straw,</b> <b>cereals</b> and grass. The essential differences between them are their different combustion behaviour {{as well as the}} different concentrations of combustion relevant elements (such as N, S, Cl, K) they contain, influencing the necessary combustion, process control and hue gas cleaning technology. Important points that are now under development focus on possibilities of NOx reduction by primary measures, as well as on higher plant efficiencies by efficient biomass drying by well adjusting the excess oxygen level in the flue gas to the requirements for a complete combustion and by recovering energy from the flue gas. Furthermore, possibilities of influencing the material fluxes of ash forming elements by primary measures aiming at a sustainable ash utilization and an efficient dust precipitation are in progress. Problems still unsolved that need comprehensive R 2 ̆ 6 amp;D in the near future are reactions taking place in the hot flue gas, causing depositions and corrosion in furnaces and boilers (especially when K-, S- and Cl-rich biomass fuels such as <b>straw,</b> <b>cereals</b> and grass are used). Research on possibilities to prevent or control them (by material selection or appropriate technologies) are of great importance. Furthermore, the ash melting behaviour and its influencing variables have to be treated as urgent. Staged combustion systems, hot fly ash precipitation as well as specially designed boilers could represent solutions for these ash and aerosol related problems. Combined heat and power (CHP) production, already realized in plants with a nominal boiler capacity greater 10 MWth based on steam turbines, is also of growing importance for small-scale applications. Moreover, the lower limit for CHP plants is a nominal boiler capacity of about 5 MWth at the moment, due to the lower electric efficiencies achievable and to the economy of scale. Interesting technologies which are right now under development are sterling engines, a newly developed steam engine (screw-type motor) and organic rankine cycles (ORC) with hydrocarbons as working fluids operating at low temperature and pressure levels tin comparison with conventional steam processes). The basic requirements for the selection of an appropriate CHP process are a high electric efficiency to investment costs ratio and a well tested technology to ensure a continuous and undisturbed operation of the plant...|$|R

Consequently, knowledge about the material fluxes of inorganic {{elements and}} compounds during biomass combustion for different kinds of biofuels and their influencing variables is of great importance. The results gained will especially influence the future design and control of biomass furnaces and boilers in order to prevent slagging, fouling and corrosion and to assist in the definition of quality requirements for biofuels as well as the possibilities of a sustainable ash utilization. For this reason, comprehensive test runs were carried out in several biomass combustion plants equipped with different combustion technologies and using various biomass fuels (wood chips, bark, <b>straw</b> and <b>cereals).</b> During continuous observation periods of at least two days, samples of the biomass and the different ash fractions were taken and analysed. Furthermore, the most important operating data of the plants were recorded. The results of the material balances for inorganic elements showed that the concentrations of environmentally relevant heavy metals (especially Cd and Zn) in biomass ashes increase with decreasing precipitation temperature and particle size. This effect is independent of the biofuel used. Consequently, a major requirement for a sustainable ash utilization is a fractionated heavy metal separation, distinguishing between different fly-ash fractions and taking the temperature of fly-ash precipitation into consideration for new furnace technologies. Research has also shown that <b>straw</b> and <b>cereals,</b> as well as their ashes, contain significantly lower amounts of heavy metals than woody biofuels and wood ashes. The same principles pointed out for environmentally relevant heavy metals are also valid for K, Na, Cl and S. The high concentrations of these elements in the filter fly-ash {{as well as in the}} boiler fly-ash are of great relevance for reactions that can take place in the boiler section where the flue gas is subjected to a considerable temperature gradient which is accompanied by chemical reactions, phase transitions and precipitation processes that can support or initiate fouling and corrosion.

Based on their chemical composition, digestibility and gas production characteristics, species could be clustered into two groups with a significant linkage distance, one for <b>cereal</b> <b>straws</b> that merged at a level of similarity of 80 % and the other for legume straws with a degree of similarity of 50 %. Species varied widely and significant differences (P < 0. 05) were observed between the two groups of straws. Legume straws showed higher crude protein (74 ± 6. 1 vs 29 ± 2. 2 g kg- 1 DM) and lower fibre (584 ± 18. 1 vs 793 ± 27. 5 g neutral detergent fibre kg- 1 DM) contents than <b>cereal</b> <b>straws</b> and, consequently, DM digestibility coefficients (0. 670 vs 0. 609; standard error of difference 0. 0054) and metabolisable energy values (7. 4 ± 0. 15 vs 5. 7 ± 0. 24 MJ kg- 1 DM) were significantly greater in legume than in <b>cereal</b> <b>straws.</b> Although there were noticeable differences among species within each botanical family, legume straws showed better nutritional quality than <b>cereal</b> <b>straws,</b> indicating that they could be considered promising and interesting sources of roughage for incorporation into ruminant diet...|$|R
30|$|It {{is likely}} that the sources of the {{recycled}} leached ash used in the ground preparations of Baroque paintings were numerous, so {{it is not possible to}} propose what plant species and parts were typically used to make the ash that reached the artists’ workshops. However, the compositions may give us some clues. For instance, the use or addition of grass, <b>straw,</b> or <b>cereal</b> ash would lower considerably the Ca/Si ratio, as such products are particularly low in Ca and rich in Si [10]. Higher Si and Al contents may originate in the presence of soil particles carried in some plant parts, particularly roots and bark.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of proper environmental enrichment {{would be a}} useful tool to tackle the welfare problems associated with intensive indoor lamb production. This study analyses the effect of enrichment with double bunk and <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> on behaviour, use of space, stress response, productive traits and meat quality variables during the finishing phase of fattening lambs. Sixty lambs were placed in enriched (ED) or conventional (CO) pens (3 pens each treatment, 10 lambs/pen) where ED had a double bunk with ramps and <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> as bedding and forage. The CO pen was barren, similar to commercial feedlots, without straw or any other enrichment. The proposed ED had {{a positive effect on}} the behavioural characteristics of the lambs, which displayed a richer behavioural repertoire, fewer stereotypes and more affiliative interactions, improving group cohesion. Moreover, ED lambs had enhanced immunity and there were no discernible detrimental effects on performance or on the commercial quality of their meat.

40|$|Chemical {{composition}} and digestibility values were obtained {{to provide a}} database for accurate values of hay and straw types produced in the Western Cape area of South Africa. Straw and hay samples were collected from 10 different localities in the Swartland and Rûens areas of South Africa. Barley hay had the highest IVOMD value (753. 2 g kg- 1), followed by wheat (744. 9 g kg- 1), triticale (720. 4 g kg- 1) and oats (697. 7 g kg- 1). Wheat hay had the highest TDN value (670. 7 g kg- 1), with oats having the lowest value (627. 5 g kg- 1). Oats was higher in NDF (602. 8 g kg- 1) {{compared to the other}} hay types. ADF values of barley (297. 9 g kg- 1), oats (342. 4 g kg- 1) and triticale (323. 0 g kg- 1) differed significantly. Oat straw had a much higher IVOMD value (392. 0 g kg- 1) compared to the other straw types. Barley had the lowest IVOMD value (293. 2 g kg- 1). The TDN value of oats (444. 8 g kg- 1) was higher than for the other straw types. Barley straw had the highest NDF value (817. 7 g kg- 1), which differed from oats (781 2 g kg- 1) and triticale (795. 4 g kg- 1). There were significant differences in the ash, CP, IVOMD, TDN and ADF contents of straw produced in the Swartland and Rûens areas. Ash, CP, IVOMD and ADF values of <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> samples were higher when produced in the Rûens. NDF values were higher in <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> samples from the Rûens, except for barley (from the Swartland), which had a higher NDF value. The TDN value of <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> was higher for the samples collected in the Rûens compared to those from the Swartland, although wheat and triticale showed higher TDN values when sampled in the Swartland. These differences should be taken into account when hay and straw from the different areas are used in formulating a balanced diet. This accentuates the importance of routine analysis of hay and <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> before use in diet formulations. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{renewable}} energy {{has increased in}} recent years due to concerns about diminishing fossil fuel supplies and global climate change. Dedicated energy crops such as corn or short rotation forestry plantations can provide feedstock for bioenergy production, but agricultural residues are typically less inexpensive because production costs {{are included in the}} cost of producing the main crop or livestock product. This report provides an overview of available crop residues and livestock manure in eastern Canada. The inventories are linked to an assessment of energy conversion systems that are either in the commercial stage or are in the late development or pilot stage. Crop Residues <b>Cereal</b> <b>straws</b> and corn stover were identified as feedstocks with high potential for bioenergy production in eastern Canada, whereas hay, soybean stover, and crop residues from oilseed production had lower potential. Approximately 1. 0 million oven dry tonnes (odt) per year (y) of <b>cereal</b> <b>straw</b> and 3. 0 million odt/y of corn stover are available in eastern Canada. By region, 615 000, 310, 00 and 65, 000 odt of straw and 1. 9 million, 1. 1 million and 6 000 odt/y of corn stover are available per year in Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic Provinces, respectively. Although corn stover represents a larger feedstock pool than <b>cereal</b> <b>straw,</b> procurement systems for stover require considerable development before this residue source can be utilized. The gross energetic potential of these residues is approximately 92 million GJ/year. Assuming a combustion efficiency of 50 %, 46 million GJ of heat energy could be produced with a gross energetic value of 22. 2 million GJ. B...|$|R
40|$|The South-East Region {{represents}} the joining place of Moldova, Muntenia and Dobrogea, situated, thus, at {{the confluence of}} the history and national culture. The administrative structure of the region includes six counties: Constanta, Tulcea, Braila, Galati, Vrancea and Buzau. Being the second largest in the 8 regions of Romania, covers 35, 762 km 2, ie 15 % of total national area. Agriculture holds an important share in the region economy, 40. 4 % of the population of region being occupied in this sector. The work studies the evolution, during 2000 - 2010, of the following technical and economic indicators specific to agriculture in South-East: the land fund, material and technical basis of agriculture, agricultural crop area and production, average production for the main crops, livestock and animal production, the number of animals per 100 ha, value of agricultural production, agricultural production indices. It shows that the total agricultural area of South-East Region met an upward curve in {{the first three years of}} the interval, decreasing slightly from the base year. Of total cultivated areas, cereals represented in 2010, 62. 6 % and 99. 8 % of the surface cultivated with cereals in 2000.
