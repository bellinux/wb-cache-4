25|$|The plays {{swept the}} {{audience}} along {{a unique and}} enjoyable journey, an Odyssey of insights which recounted the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> member of an invisible minority who struggled with her sexuality and, over time, grew increasingly confident and self-aware, {{with more than a}} little help from her friends. Heng hoped that the LGBT community would relate to the plays which included 'insider' jokes and references that could only be fully appreciated by the gay community, with scripts that were not dumbed down to accommodate a straight audience. Owing to its lesbian theme, the producers experienced great difficulty in securing a corporate sponsor.|$|E
25|$|A {{visit to}} the {{workshops}} always makes a deep impression. At the forges hirsute men, stripped to the waist, move rapidly and methodically {{in front of the}} ovens. The bars of iron, heated to an exact temperature, are swallowed by the presses and moulded into the desired shape in a second. The rough form of a shell, glowing bright red, and carrying on its flank the first identification marks, is then rolled towards the yard, like a beautiful but terrible toy, a friend of the graves. As soon as the shell has cooled enough, skilful hands take it, smooth and polish it, and finish it to perfection. But it was dangerous work, and the hospital had a steady stream of ‘work-wounded’ to deal with, some minor, some much more serious. As an example, here is part of the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> man.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{graphics}} and artwork pieces were increased greatly, more recent and new LIPS functions were incorporated, and the ARMS (Active & Realtime Machine System) battle system introduced in later Sakura Wars titles was incorporated with new improvements including special attacks with accompanying short movies. Two additional story episodes were added — one expanded the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the supporting characters {{while the other}} connected to the next entry in the Sakura Wars series. New voice acting was also recorded, including a replacement voice actress for Sumire due to original actress Tomizawa's retirement from the role in the early 2000s. The music was redone by Tanaka, mainly {{at the insistence of}} the original voice cast. Sakura Wars: In Hot Blood was released on February 22, 2003. First print editions came with a special DVD which included a documentary detailing the development process of the Sakura Wars series up to that point. Mobile-based tie-in content related to the original mini-games was released later that year. Implementing this content proved problematic, with the team eventually using a password system for players to access content.|$|E

25|$|In 1948 {{the first}} person of Māori descent to accept the Bahá’í Faith was Albert White, who was one quarter Māori. In 1949 the first Persian Bahá'í pioneer, Manoochehr Ala’i, arrived {{as a student at}} Massey College. In 1953 the first {{standing}} Hand of the Cause, the highest appointed position in the religion open to all, `Alí-Akbar Furútan, visited New Zealand. In 1957 the New Zealand community held its first independent convention to elect its own National Spiritual Assembly with three delegates from Auckland and two each from Devonport, New Plymouth and Wellington. This convention elected the first National Spiritual Assembly of New Zealand. In 1958 Hand of the Cause of God, Enoch Olinga visited the Ngaruawahia Marae and talked with elders and four years later, when Hand of the Cause of God, Dr Muhajir visited, Ephraim Te Paa, a Kaumatua (Māori elder) from Ahipara converted to the religion. In 1963 with the election of the Universal House of Justice the Hands of the Cause updated and published a kind of census of the religion. At that time there were four assemblies -Auckland, Devonport, Hamilton, Wellington - and 18 localities with smaller groups of Bahá'ís - see maps. The <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> convert in 1964 includes her concern for her bi-racial children and despair at the bigotry of interracial marriage among the very minorities her children were members (she being Celt and married a Māori) when she found this kind of marriage highly accepted among Bahá'ís. The members of the National Assembly, who participated in the convention for the first election of the Universal House of Justice, were: Hugh Blundell, John Carr, Margaret Harnish, Linda Hight, Percy Leadley, Phyllis Milne, Jean Simmons, Douglas Weeks, and Terry Stirling. The New Zealand Bahá'í community came to the assistance of refugees in 1979 from the persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran who were allowed to settle in New Zealand. Between 1987 and 1989, a further 142 Iranian Bahá'ís settled in New Zealand.|$|E

New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges, released in 2011, told the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of these people finally arriving on land.

500|$|The couple's backstory was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} told during season three; however during season two, the Lost writers wanted to tell the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the background characters of the show.

Caldwell's husband was going through health problems during the shooting of the first season, which was the inspiration for Rose's flashbacks in [...] "S.O.S.".
