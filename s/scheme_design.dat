500|$|For the February 1993 bid {{the city}} council {{submitted}} another 80,000-capacity stadium design produced by design consultants Arup Associates, the firm that helped select the Eastlands site. On 23 September 1993, the games were awarded to Sydney, but the following year Manchester submitted the same <b>scheme</b> <b>design</b> to the Millennium Commission as a [...] "Millennium Stadium", only to have this proposal rejected. Undeterred, Manchester City Council subsequently bid to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games, once again proposing the same site along with downsized stadium plans derived from the 2000 Olympics bid, and this time were successful. In 1996, this same planned stadium competed with Wembley Stadium to gain funding to become the new national stadium, but the money was used to redevelop Wembley.|$|E

50|$|The scheme has a {{much smaller}} {{reservoir}} area (120 km2) than the Lower Se San 2 site (355 km2) and consequently a lesser environmental impact.

The <b>scheme</b> <b>design</b> as finalised in 1972 had a tight inner city underground ring, operating in one direction only. The existing suburban rail line routes were to be used with track duplication to avoid freight conflicts, with extensions to Hobsonville and Howick and two new lines; under the harbour to Whangaparaoa and south to the Airport.|$|E

5000|$|The {{organisation}} {{was founded}} in early 2008 from the merging of several student groups based at the University of Auckland and the University of Canterbury with similar goals of community development.The foundations of EWBNZ were laid in 2006 {{when a group of}} eight engineering students called PULSE, led by student Holly Corbett and engineer Craig Omundsen, undertook a water <b>scheme</b> <b>design</b> for World Vision in Vanuatu. The PULSE group then completed an assessment programme of village-managed water schemes in Samoa in 2007. These trips inspired another group to form in 2007 called CREW led by student Haydn Luckman. Their work in Samoa included collaboration with the local community to install water tanks, and design and construct a new wharf. These two groups, based in Auckland, merged along with a group from the University of Canterbury, led by student Sofian Irsheid, to come under the name [...] "Engineers Without Borders New Zealand" [...] (EWBNZ). [...] "Engineers Without Borders" [...] is a well recognised name that has been adopted by similar organisations in Australia (Engineers Without Borders Australia), Canada (Engineers Without Borders Canada) and worldwide.|$|E
