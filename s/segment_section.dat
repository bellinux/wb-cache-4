The segment, which is [...] long, was constructed by the Horn–Kiewit Construction Company. In January 1974, a contract, D-21308, was put out for the construction of Section 7 of Route 132-C, which spanned an area between 2nd Street and 9th Street in the East Village. On July 25, 1974, construction on the segment was started near Second Street by Slattery Associates. Another contract, for a Midtown segment between 50th and 54th Streets, was awarded that year for $34.6 million, with constructed expected to begin in the fall. However, construction never commenced. In total, construction on the Second Avenue Line during the 1970s spanned over 27 blocks.|$|E
2500|$|Mathematical {{analysis}} formally {{developed in}} the 17th century during the Scientific Revolution, but many of its ideas {{can be traced back}} to earlier mathematicians. Early results in analysis were implicitly present in the early days of ancient Greek mathematics. For instance, an infinite geometric sum is implicit in Zeno's paradox of the dichotomy.⁄2 + 1⁄22 + 1⁄23 + 1⁄24 + ... and that Archimedes found the area of the parabolic <b>segment</b> (<b>Section</b> 4.4) essentially by summing the infinite series 1 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄42 + 1⁄43 + ... = 4⁄3. Both these examples are special cases of the result we express as summation of a geometric series}} Later, Greek mathematicians such as Eudoxus and Archimedes made more explicit, but informal, use of the concepts of limits and convergence when they used the method of exhaustion to compute the area and volume of regions and solids. The explicit use of infinitesimals appears in Archimedes' The Method of Mechanical Theorems, a work rediscovered in the 20th century. In Asia, the Chinese mathematician Liu Hui used the method of exhaustion in the 3rd century AD to find the area of a circle. Zu Chongzhi established a method that would later be called Cavalieri's principle to find the volume of a sphere in the 5th century. [...] The Indian mathematician Bhāskara II gave examples of the derivative and used what is now known as Rolle's theorem in the 12th century.|$|E

Since this is so, the microworld Super Point {{was developed to}} teach coordinate geometry to tenth-grade and older students including pre-service elementary school teachers. This microworld enables the learner to plot points, draw lines, line segments, rays and circles. In the section on points, the student learns about the four quadrants. In the line section, the student is introduced to parallel and perpendicular lines. Within the line <b>segment</b> <b>section,</b> the learner explores the concepts of midpoint and length of a line segment. The joining of two rays is shown to form {{a line in the}} section on rays. Concentric circles are taught within the circle section. The students are given an opportunity to create procedures of their own. These procedures are to identify which quadrant an inputted point lies in, to determine the slope of a given line, or to graph a line using a different equation than the microworld’s line command uses. It was found that students had a favorable attitude towards using the microworld and working on a computer. During subsequent evaluation, it appeared that the concepts taught within the Super Point microworld were acquired by the students. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To measure intra-operative {{blood loss}} at {{elective}} lower <b>segment</b> caesarean <b>section</b> and to compare estimated wtih measured blood loss. Design: Prospective observational study. Blood loss {{was measured in}} patients who underwent lower <b>segment</b> caesarean <b>section</b> {{in the course of}} routine hospital activity. Setting: Tsan Yuk Hospital (Hong Kong), which is affiliated to the University of Hong Kong, 1990 - 1991. Subjects: Forty women (mean age 29 years) with singleton pregnancies (mean gestation 38 weeks) delivered by elective lower <b>segment</b> caesarean <b>section</b> under general anaesthesia (mean birth weight 3177 g). Main ontcome measure: Intra-operative blood loss measured by the alkaline haematin method (intra-assay co-efficient of variation 2. 2 %). Results: The mean measured blood loss was 487 ml (SE 40, range 164 - 1438). The mean estimated blood loss was 425 ml (SE 31) range 100 - 1300; mode 400). Observer error in estimating blood loss was higher if measured blood loss > 600 ml. One patient received a blood transfusion and another had a post-operative haemoglobin level < 10. 0 g/dl. Conclusion: Blood loss at elective lower <b>segment</b> caesarean <b>section</b> was usually < 500 ml and was estimated with reasonable accuracy.

The usefulness of NEURON degrades very slowly with increased complexity of morphology and ANALYSIS AND MODELING OF NEURAL SYSTEMS II membrane mechanisms. NEURON is best suited, in terms of efficiency, for problems ranging from parts of single cells to small numbers of cells in which cable properties play a crucial role. It is best suited, in terms of conceptual control, for stylized morphologies represented as connected cable sections and where membrane channel parameters are conveniently represented as piece-wise linear functions of position within each section. Two special classes of problems for which it is well suited are those in which it is important to calculate ionic concentrations and those where one needs to compute the extracellular potential just next to the nerve membrane. It is well suited for investigating new kinds of membrane channels since they are described using a high level model description language which allows the expression of models in terms of kinetic schemes or sets of simultaneous equations.

40|$|The Canadian Space Agency's (CSA) Software and Ground <b>Segment</b> <b>Section</b> (SGS) has {{the mandate}} to develop {{innovative}} emerging software and on-board satellite and ground segment computer technologies. To that end, {{there is an}} ongoing development of a simulation environment to test COTS (Commercial-Of-The-Shelf) technologies. There are severe cost constraints {{in all aspects of}} many space missions due to the limited return on investment and scarce commercialization opportunities that come with many science missions. There is an opportunity to explore the innovative implementation of COTS technologies to reduce the mission cost and maximize performance available from COTS components. However, using COTS technologies in the space environment has ist constraints and therefore designing a spacecraft mission has to involve some new techniques that allow implementation of these components and minimize the risk of failure. The goal of our project is to develop a simulation environment, itself using COTS components, and then to allow the seamless integration of various components to test spacecraft mission concepts. For example, one of the aspects of using COTS processors in space is to protect them from the radiation environment. The current state of the simulation tests an innovative software EDAC (Error Detection and Correction) package and a redundant processor configuration to investigate protection against the effects of radiation and other failures on a generic mission. It also includes the capability to test formation-flying concepts that have the potential to revolutionize cost reduction efforts for space missions and to enable new space applications. This paper describes the simulation environment in detail and illustrates some of the technologies being tested for possible future space missions.

The 48 weaned male lambs of Ganjia sheep weighing (23. 18 ± 2. 16) kg at the age of 3 - 5 months were divided similarly into three groups which each group included 16 lambs. Lambs were fed diets with a concentrate-roughage ratio of 40 : 60 (A), 50 : 50 (B) and 60 : 40 (C).

50|$|A {{specialized}} type of HRSG without boiler drums is the once-through steam generator. In this design, {{the inlet}} feedwater follows a continuous path without <b>segmented</b> <b>sections</b> for economizers, evaporators, and superheaters. This provides {{a high degree}} of flexibility as the sections are allowed to grow or contract based on the heat load being received from the gas turbine. The absence of drums allows for quick changes in steam production and fewer variables to control, and is ideal for cycling and base load operation. With proper material selection, an OTSG can be run dry, meaning the hot exhaust gases can pass over the tubes with no water flowing inside the tubes. This eliminates the need for a bypass stack and exhaust gas diverter system which is required to operate a combustion turbine with a drum-type HRSG out of service.|$|R
