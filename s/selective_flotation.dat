40|$|Potassium amyl {{xanthate}} (PAX) {{and sodium}} isobutyl xanthate (SIBX) {{are commonly used}} collectors in both the bulk and <b>selective</b> froth <b>flotation</b> of sulfide ores. These thiol xanthate collectors are conventionally mixed together {{as well as with}} more selective thiol collectors such as dithiophosphates (DTP) and dithiocarbamates (DTC), in order to improve selectivity. With deteriorating nickel sulfide ores, more selective collectors and collector mixtures are desired for the efficient extraction of nickel. Thionocarbamates (TC) are another group of thiol collectors used for <b>selective</b> froth <b>flotation</b> of sulfide minerals. Thionocarbamates are especially used in the <b>selective</b> froth <b>flotation</b> of chalcopyrite over pyrite and galena, but little is known about its selectivity with regards to nickel.

The XPS spectra revealed the presence of molecular amine together with the protonated amine on silicate surface. Based on these observations, a model of successive two-dimensional and three-dimensional precipitation was suggested to explain amine adsorption on a silicate surface.

This paper investigates the spreading of mixtures of hydroxamic acids and alcohols, recently identified and developed as collectors for the <b>selective</b> <b>flotation</b> of phosphate minerals. The spreading of collector drops on surfaces of apatite and the gangue minerals (dolomite and quartz) immersed in water or surfactant solutions was measured using a high-speed video system and the dynamic contact angle was determined from the transient profiles of the collector drops. Surface and interfacial tensions were measured applying the Du Nouy ring method. The dynamic wetting behavior of collector drops was described using the molecular kinetic theory. This analysis indicates that hydroxamic acids increase {{the interaction between the}} alcohol solution and the apatite surface, producing a strong collector attachment. Further information regarding spreading characteristics was obtained from studies at a graphite surface used as a model surface to reveal the nature of the hydrophobic/hydrophobic interaction. The spreading resistance was increased by the hydroxamic acid adsorption resulting in a decrease in the rate of spreading. Both theoretical and experimental results show that at the air-water and alcohol-water interfaces hydroxamic acids exhibit unique interfacial characteristics which account for the <b>selective</b> <b>flotation</b> of apatite from quartz.

40|$|Gangue {{minerals}} {{can often}} have severe {{adverse effects on}} selective value mineral separation. Such effects can be mediated {{through a variety of}} pathways or mechanisms. One popular mechanism is that of "slime coating" or heterocoagulation, wherein the gangue mineral fines are believed to coat the value mineral surfaces and thereby reduce selectivity and floatability. Another pathway that has received relatively little attention is that mediated through the effect of gangue minerals on pulp rheology, and consequently selective separation. Our recent work in developing a scientific understanding of these effects has highlighted the prevalence and importance of this pathway. In this study, the impact of shape and morphology of serpentine gangue minerals on suspension rheology and <b>selective</b> Ni <b>flotation</b> from ultramafic ores was investigated. We found strong evidence for microand macro-network formation in the presence of acicular (needle-shaped) or fibrous minerals, which impacted pulp rheological properties. Results also supported the hypothesis that morphology has a greater role to play than mere shape. The size of the network ranged from 5 microns to 2 em depending upon the amount and aspect ratio of fibrous minerals. These networks impede many flotation sub-processes, such as gas dispersion and bubble-particle interactions. Additionally, the small pore size of the networks prevents bubble penetration leading to a large transport of the gangue minerals to the concentrate via lifting of the entire network by bubble flux, which resulted in a significant grade dilution. Based on the scientific insights generated in this study various techniques have been developed to improve selective value mineral separation...|$|R

The problem is however that most of the plastics have relatively similar hydrophobic surfaces preventing them to be selectively sorted by the flotation method.

In this study, pyrochlore samples were collected from various points in the flotation scheme at the Niobec plant, Quebec, Canada. The SEM-EDX analysis revealed that pyrochlore from the Niobec deposit occurs as high and low iron varieties, and that recovery favours varieties with a lower Fe content. To understand a potential relationship between pyrochlore matrix composition and the related effect on collector adsorption, the surface of grains from the concentrate and tails were examined by TOF-SIMS. The surface analyses of different pyrochlore grains showed that species indicative of the cationic collector (Tallow diamine acetate) favour Fe poor pyrochlore relative to the Fe rich variety. XPS was used to analyse the surface of high Fe and low Fe pyrochlore in order to identify a potential relationship between pyrochlore matrix composition and surface chemistry. The XPS results verified a relationship between pryochlore surface oxidation and Fe content in the mineral matrix; high Fe pyrochlore particles showed a greater proportion of surface oxidation species suggesting preferential oxidation in comparison with low Fe pyrochlore particles. SEM-EDX analyses revealed that many of the pyrochlore grains were compositionally zoned into regions of high and low Fe contents. TOF-SIMS and XPS analyses were used to analyse the surface of the compositionally zoned Fe pyrochlore grains, in order to link collector adsorption to Fe contents and identify potential mechanisms for the partitioning. Surface analyses of conditioned pyrochlore grains showing zones of high and low Fe content revealed that species indicative of the collector favour the regions with low iron. XPS analyses of similarly treated compositionally zoned pyrochlore grains showed that a greater proportion of surface oxidation species corresponded to the zones with high matrix Fe content.
