40|$|Abstract. Shrinkage {{cracks in}} {{swelling}} soils determine their transport properties. An available model of shrinkage cracks in a brittle medium, having constant relevant properties and desiccating in conditions of shock drying, {{is used as}} a basis for the description of crack growth in water saturated <b>soils</b> undergoing <b>desiccation</b> and shrinkage. A key point is the existence of a minimum crack capable of developing at shrinkage. The concept of the minimum quasi-brittle crack capable of developing at shrinkage leads to two possible types of shrinkage cracks in clay soils.

The tensile failure for all tests occurred by a comparable constant change of the degree of saturation. The soil specific saturation ratio Sr,s is defined as the quotient of saturation changes ΔSr to initial saturation Sr, 0. This parameter related to the total suction shows an equal course for all results. All in all, the course of the soil specific saturation ratio Sr,s is independent of all initial parameters.

50|$|Vegetation impacts soils in {{numerous}} ways. It can prevent erosion caused by excessive rain that {{might result from}} surface runoff. Plants shade soils, keeping them cooler and slow evaporation of soil moisture, or conversely, by way of transpiration, plants can cause soils to lose moisture, resulting in complex and highly variable relationships between leaf area index (measuring light interception) and moisture loss: more generally plants prevent <b>soil</b> from <b>desiccation</b> during driest months while they dry it during moister months, thereby acting as a buffer against strong moisture variation. Plants can form new chemicals that can break down minerals and improve the soil structure. The type and amount of vegetation depends on climate, topography, soil characteristics, and biological factors. Soil factors such as density, depth, chemistry, pH, temperature and moisture greatly affect the type of plants that can grow in a given location. Dead plants and fallen leaves and stems begin their decomposition on the surface.

40|$|In the Loess Plateau, <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> {{has become}} a serious problem for forest and grass vegetation. <b>Soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> leads to the {{formation}} of a dried soil layer (DSL). This paper presents the results of research carried out in {{the central part of the}} Loess Plateau. The objective of the research was to produce a statistically supported set of indicators for evaluating <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> of forestlands, to present a heuristic idea for <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> and to supply scientific support for replacing farmland with forest or grass in the Loess Plateau and other regions of China. Here, we suggest that more attention should be paid to <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> and its effects on the ecosystem of the region in the future. The results showed that natural Quercus liaotungensis forestlands (NQF) retained more water content than regrown Robinnia pseudoscacia forestlands (RRF). Significant DSLs were formed in the RRF but not in the NQF. A possible reason for no formation of DSL in NQF could be due to the presence of an arbor-shrub-herb stand structure and large humus and litter accumulation, which increased the natural forest's (NF) adaptability to the environmental conditions. Soil water content in the north-facing slope was significantly larger than in the south-facing slope. DSLs formed in the 0 - 500 cm layer of the south-facing slope. When slope gradient was greater than 25 degrees, soil water content deceased sharply and showed significant difference compared with 9 degrees, 15 degrees and 20 degrees (P < 0. 05). So, we conclude that plant species, aspect and slope angle could be the predicators for the formation of DSLs. The analysis on soil physical properties of 0 - 60 cm layer indicated that plant species, aspect and slope angle also have significant effects on bulk density, porosity, plant-available capacity, and hydraulic conductivity, especially in the 0 - 20 and 20 - 40 cm layers. In the NQF and RRF with north-facing slope, soil physical properties were improved. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that clayey <b>soils</b> {{undergoing}} <b>desiccation</b> tend to shrink and eventually crack. Analysis of the behaviour and influence of cracks in these types of soils is very important in several engineering fields such as mine tailing dams, long-term radioactive waste storage, impervious core of earth dams, and in any situation where clay is used as a barrier to fluid flow. Loss of humidity and cracking changes the permeability of such barriers that may no longer work properly and pose potentially high risks to property and lives. This paper presents an analysis of cracking during drying of soils using a computer code de-veloped {{within the framework of the}} finite element and finite differences methods. A study of the influence of crack initiation and propagation in the desiccation process is also undertaken, with a comparative analysis of the phenomenon both with and without crack generation that allows some preliminary conclusions about the desiccation problem. The computer code has been implemented within the MatLab environment. The formulation is based on the principles of the unsaturated soil mechanics and the mechanics of a continuum medium.

The effect of wax coating on grain formation under <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> was also studied in two selected genotypes. There were significant variations in both root water-uptake ability estimated in pot experiments and grain yield obtained in field experiments among wheat genotypes. Infrared thermography indicated that canopy temperature {{was related to the}} leaf transpiration due to root water-uptake. A significant negative correlation was found between root water-uptake ability and grain weight, suggesting that lower root water-uptake ability was associated with higher grain weight.

The Precision Agriculture Landscape Modeling System (PALMS) contains a Mesopore and Matrix (M&M) module, which was tested on cracking soil at the plot and field scale. The M&M module predicted 10 times more mesopore area than, but was linearly related to, measurements of crack area. Four irrigation events on plots of cracked soil and volumetric water content (VWC) output for the M&M module was compared to neutron moisture meter readings. Previous measurements of VWC and runoff on a 4. 4 ha subwatershed were compared to predictions. The M&M module moved water down the profile quickly and eliminated unobserved ponding (plot) and runoff (field) that were simulated without the mesopores, modeling mesopore flow did produce more drainage.

Treatability testing supports evaluation of remedial technologies for technetium- 99 (Tc- 99) contamination in the vadose zone at sites such as the BC Cribs and Trenches. <b>Soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> has been selected as the first technology for testing {{because it has been}} recommended as a promising technology in previous Hanford Site technology evaluations and because testing of <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> will provide useful information to enhance evaluation of other technologies, in particular gas-phase remediation technologies. A <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> pilot test (SDPT) will evaluate the desiccation process (e. g., how the targeted interval is dried) and the long-term performance for mitigation of contaminant transport. The SDPT will dry out a moist zone contaminated by Tc- 99 and nitrate that has been detected at Well 299 -E 13 - 62 (Borehole C 5923). This {{air emissions}} document applies to the activities to be completed to conduct the SDPT in the 200 -BC- 1 operable unit located in the 200 East Area of the Hanford Site. Well 299 -E 13 - 62 is planned to be used as an injection well. This well is located between and approximately equidistant from cribs 216 -B- 16, 216 -B- 17, 216 -B- 18. and 216 -B- 19. Nitrogen gas will be pumped at approximately 300 ft{sup 3 }/min into the 299 -EI 3 - 62 injection well, located approximately 12 m (39 ft) away from extraction well 299 -EI 3 - 65. The soil gas extraction rate will be approximately 150 ft{sup 3 }/min. The SDPT will be conducted continuously over a period of approximately six months. The purpose of the test is to evaluate <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> as a potential remedy for protecting groundwater. A conceptual depiction is provided in Figure 1. The <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> process will physically dry, or evaporate, some of the water from the moist zone of interest. As such, it is expected that Tc- 99 and nitrate will remain with the water residual that is not removed, or remain as a salt bound to the soil particles. In addition, the SDPT will be conducted at lower extraction velocities to preclude pore water entrainment and thus, the extracted air effluent should be free of the contaminant residual present in the targeted moist zone. However, to conservatively bound the planned activity for potential radionuclide air emissions, it is assumed, hypothetically, that the Tc- 99 does not remain in the zone of interest, but that it instead travels with the evaporated moisture to the extraction well and to the test equipment at the land surface. Thus, a release potential would exist from the planned point source (powered exhaust) for Tc- 99 in the extracted moist air. In this hypothetical bounding case there would also be a potential for very minor fugitive emissions to occur due to nitrogen injection into the soil. The maximum value for Tc- 99, measured in the contaminated moist zone, is used in calculating the release potential described in Section 2. 3. The desiccation mechanism will be evaporation. Nitrate is neither a criteria pollutant nor a toxic air pollutant. It would remain nitrate as a salt adhered to sand and silt grains or as nitrate dissolved in the pore water. Nitrogen, an inert gas, will be injected into the ground during the test. Tracer gasses will also be injected near the beginning, middle, {{and the end of the}} test.

Productivity peaked when forestlands were 5 - to 8 -year-old and then tended to decrease in a pattern that followed the fluctuation of annual rainfall. In 1 - to 7 -year-old forestlands, annual water consumptions were higher than annual rainfalls, which resulted in soil drying at 0 – 10 m depth; <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> rates in Luochuan, Changwu, Yan’an and Guyuan were 164. 3, 165. 7, 187. 1 and 190. 0 mm per year, respectively.

It describes the various threats, what a vital soil is and which factors {{play a key role in}} this vital system: soil structure, buffer capacity, organic matter content, and the variety of soil organisms. It also indicates how the vitality of the soil should be monitored. Publishers' Versio...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} <b>desiccation</b> cracks in <b>soils</b> {{has been a}} subject of {{increasing}} attention in recent research. This paper presents {{the use of a}} 2 D profile laser that is coupled with a motion controller (that allows scanning the overall surface of a drying soil) and electronic balance (to measure the water loss). The aim is to accurately track the three most relevant variables associated with the behavior 14 of soils during desiccation: volume change, water loss and evolving crack network’s morphology. The paper presents the methodology to obtain a digital model of the soil using the experimental setup described above. The main results of a natural soil subjected to drying are presented and discussed, including evolution of cracks aperture; evolution of cracks depth, surface contour levels (at different times); and evolution of volume change. It is shown that the proposed methodology provides very useful information for studying the behavior of <b>soils</b> subjected to <b>desiccation...</b>|$|R
40|$|In humid ecosystems, {{the rate}} of methane (CH 4) {{oxidation}} by soil-dwelling methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) is con-trolled by soil texture and soil water holding capacity, both of which limit the diffusion of atmospheric CH 4 into the soil. However, it remains unclear whether these same mechanisms control CH 4 oxidation in more arid soils. This {{study was designed to}} measure the proximate controls of potential CH 4 oxidation in semiarid soils during different seasons. Using a unique and well-constrained 3 -million-year-old semiarid substrate age gradient, we were able to hold state factors constant while exploring the relationship between seasonal potential CH 4 oxidation rates and soil texture, soil water holding capacity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We measured unexpectedly higher rates of potential CH 4 oxidation in the wet season than the dry season. Although other studies have attributed low CH 4 oxi-dation rates in dry <b>soils</b> to <b>desiccation</b> of MOB, we present several lines of evidence that this may be inaccurate. We found that soil DOC concentration explained CH 4 oxidation rates better than soil physical factors that regulate the diffusion of CH 4 from the atmosphere into the soil. We show evidence that MOB facultatively incorporated isotopi-cally labeled glucose into their cells, and MOB utilized glucose in a pattern among our study sites that was similar to wet-season CH 4 oxidation rates. This evidence suggests that DOC, which is utilized by MOB in other environments with varying effects on CH 4 oxidation rates, may be an important regulator of CH 4 oxidation rates in semiarid soils...|$|R
40|$|Serious <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation,</b> {{resulting}} from climatic conditions and poor land management, {{may lead to}} the formation of a dried soil layer (DSL), which can negatively affect ecological and hydrological processes. To mitigate these effects through management, it is necessary to understand property interactions within DSLs, compared with those in the whole soil profile, and DSL formation processes under different land uses. We investigated the relationships between soil water content (SWC) and plant root indices, and other soil properties, under various land uses in the Liudaogou watershed on the Loess Plateau, China. We also studied the development of DSLs {{as a function of the}} growth age of two vegetation types. Rate of formation and thickness of DSLs were dependent on vegetation type: DSLs formed after 2 years of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) growth and 3 years of Caragana korshinskii growth; after 4 years of growth, DSLs under alfalfa were thicker than those under C korshinskii, but after 31 years the DSL thickness under C korshinskii (4. 4 m) exceeded that formed under alfalfa (3 m). The more persistent DSLs occurred below a 100 cm thick upper soil layer that was seasonally dried and replenished by rainfall under both vegetation types. The degree of <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> under natural vegetation was generally less than that under non-indigenous plant species, and was similarly less over a period of about 30 years for a natural plant succession sequence than for an artificial one. Thus, the use of natural vegetation succession management principles would possibly reduce <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> during vegetative restoration. Densities of root length, weight, and surface area, and the average root diameter of soybean (Glycine max), alfalfa, Stipa bubgeana, and C korshinskii all decreased with increases in soil depths below 20 cm. Correlations between SWC and root indices, and various soil physical and chemical properties, were generally weaker within the DSL layers than within the whole soil profile. The only significant correlation was between soil organic carbon and SWC under alfalfa (r = 0. 627, P < 0. 05). <b>Soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> may thus interfere with these typical interrelationships occurring within the whole soil profile. Our findings may provide a helpful base reference for the control and restoration of DSLs occurring on the Loess Plateau and in similar and and semi-arid regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Desiccation of {{clay soil}} caused by {{vegetation}} - grass, bushes and trees - {{and its effects}} on the stability of slopes, buildings, roads and other structures has long been a topic of interest and concern to the geotechnical engineer. Several international symposia on the topic have been held during the past 60 years, and the literature on the subject is voluminous. A review of past studies of <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> and its effects showed that, with few exceptions, investigations had been of a short-term nature and had not adequately considered the variable annual effects of atmospheric and hydrological causes of <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> and rehydration. As a contribution to providing this longer-term information, it was decided to embark on an extended study of the effects of evapotranspiration by vegetation and atmospheric climate on the seasonal and year-to-year variation of soil water content. The study is now complete and this paper presents an overview of the investigation from 2000 to 2006, including the influence of annual weather variations on the desiccating effects of lines of trees and bushes, the potential effects of desiccation caused by single trees on adjacent buildings, and the portrayal of these effects by means of soil water content and storage profiles, and soil water balances...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{vegetation}} establishment has {{not only}} helped to prevent serious soil and water loss on the Loess Plateau of China but also led to reduced water availability and <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation.</b> Examining the water balance of forested and farmed land allowed us to determine water consumption of vegetation and understand the mechanisms of <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation,</b> important factors for the sustainable conversion of farmland to forest in this area. The effects of forests and crops on the water balance within the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system were studied using a coupled water and heat flow model known as "CoupModel'', which was calibrated {{on the basis of}} field measurements of soil water content, surface runoff, throughfall, stemflow, leaf area index, vegetation cover, canopy height and depth of root system in the hill and gully region of the Loess Plateau. Data were collected between 27 May 2006 and 31 October 2007. Two types of planted vegetation (acacia forest and farmland) in the Yan'gou watershed {{in the northern part of}} the Shaanxi Province were chosen to examine water transfer in the absence of soil texture (silt loam) differences and to explore the importance of vegetation type in relation to water balance. The simulations indicated that vegetation type and slope aspect significantly influenced the magnitude of every water balance component in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system. Compared to forest, farming the land reduced interception (69. 1 - 78. 3 %) and transpiration (37. 3 - 40. 4 %), while increasing surface runoff by a factor of 5. 0 - 40. 2 and soil evaporation by 3. 1 - 32. 0 %. Thus, farming resulted in 1. 1 - 1. 2 times more soil water storage than afforestation. Therefore, canopy interception and transpiration are responsible for <b>soil</b> <b>desiccation</b> in plantation forests. Simulation differences in water balance between acacia forest and farmland highlight that when converting farmland to forest on the Loess Plateau of China, tree species should be selected with care; this is particularly important on south-facing slopes.

40|$|Surface {{cracks and}} {{shrinkage}} in soil affects its geotechnical properties in various ways. Permeability of soil changes due to cracks in clay barriers {{which lead to}} development of preferential flow paths for transportation of contaminants. Development of cracks may also lead to decrease in bearing capacity of soil. In case of earth embankments, cracks reduce strength and lead to seepage and percolation problems. Integrity and stability of landfill liners are affected by surface cracks, apart from leachate infiltration. Alignment of embedded pipes can be changed due to the surface shrinkage. They can cause slope instability and can contributes to the land slides in hilly areas. Hence, knowledge of surface cracks and the shrinkage behaviour of soil is essential to improve the understanding and prediction of changes of unsaturated hydraulic properties in heterogeneous and non-rigid soils. This paper {{is an attempt to}} introduce a novel methodology for quantifying surface cracks and shrinkage that appears in <b>soil</b> after <b>desiccation</b> under atmospheric conditions using image analysis technique. ImajeJ software has been used for image processing and Matlab for the calculation of surface cracks and shrinkage area. The samples used for the study is synthetic soil obtained by mixing bentonite and fly ash in various proportions. The effect of variable parameters like sample thickness, moisture content, fly ash content and fibres content on the surface cracks and shrinkage of the bentonite-fly ash mix have been studied. From results it was found that CDF and CIF depends on the chosen parameters i. e. fly ash content, moisture content, fibres content and specimen thickness. There was a reduction in CDF and CIF values with increase in fly ash content and fibres content, while it was increased with the increase in moisture content and specimen thicknes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore a {{relatively}} simple, non-destructive, indirect technique using a ground penetrating radar (GPR) system to detect cracks that form and propagate inside a <b>soil</b> specimen during <b>desiccation.</b> Although GPR devices {{have been used for}} multiple applications, their use in the detection of small cracks (few millimetres wide), has not been demonstrated yet. The experiments and the methodology used to test the accuracy of a small commercial GPR device for crack identification are described. The main objective was to identify what type of signals and what crack width can be detected using the GPR device. The results indicate that cracks of one or two millimetres wide can be detected depending on its position and shape. On the other hand, sub-millimetre cracks are undetectable with the currently existing devices in the market. In spite of the limitations the GPR method can be useful to find time-related bounds of when the cracks appear, and to point at their location. Because the GPR systems are in constant evolution this technique could become a very versatile and convenient method to scan soils under different kinds of processes both in the laboratory and in the field...|$|R
50|$|Sceliages {{species have}} {{developed}} special adaptations to disarticulate millipedes - {{such as the}} shape of the clypeal margin, in particular the two front ‘teeth’, and the middle legs. The curvature of the meso tibiae is most evident in S. adamastor, fitting snugly around the circumference of the larger spirobolid, spirostreptid and julid millipedes. The adult male or female beetle straddles the subdued millipede and locks onto it particularly with the mid legs, and uses the front clypeal teeth to prise apart the ring segments of the millipede. Front legs assist in this operation, but the main work is done by the front clypeal teeth. The viscera or gut contents, the legs, and some bits of chitin are then used to form some 1-3 brood-balls {{depending on the size of}} the millipede. Brood-balls are prepared in a chamber underground and segment rings are discarded into the burrow. The brood-balls, each with one egg, are coated with a compacted layer of clayey <b>soil</b> to prevent <b>desiccation,</b> and are watched over by the female. Some Cephalodesmius species from Australia introduce additional food supplies as the larva develops, but this is not the case with Sceliages.|$|R
