40|$|Previous work in {{the area}} of {{improving}} the performance of steam system in palm oil mills can be found in books and journals published by Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB). However, very little data has been published on operating experiences and scientific facts as well as economic aspects of back pressure vessel system. The data is also often found to be contradictory with the actual industrial requirement in handling pressure fluctuation of steam line in palm oil mill. Furthermore, there is very scarce literature on proper sizing methods for back pressure vessel. The design of back pressure vessel in palm oil mills is still largely based on undeveloped approaches and is carried out by individuals lacking exposure to the palm oil milling industry. The size of back pressure vessel varies between 1 to 12 m 3 and the choice is usually dictated by the manufacturer and the capacity of steam consumed by turbine.

40|$|A field {{investigation}} {{was done in}} a typical palm oil mill, the Tanah Merah Palm Oil Mill, Malaysia. There had been previous report of pressure fluctuations and losses of steam especially at boilers and back pressure vessel when <b>sterilisers</b> were operating at normal steam load condition. Field trips were undertaken for this investigation. The field works study was aimed towards studying fluctuation in the overall steam supply and demands in the mill. This study on variations in energy availability and steam distribution to various parts in the mill was initiated to provide a bottom-line understanding of the mill current operating situation and identify steam losses and fluctuation problems. The total steam consumption and losses in the mill could be then determined. Total fuel (press fibre and shell) produced for each tonne of FFB processed, fuel consumption by the boiler operation and performance of the sterilisation process were also considered during field investigations. The relevant data at various sites collected on the field trips were used to verify mass and energy balances on the steam system, identify critical problems in steam demand fluctuation and develop mathematical model for representing the process operation at referred areas in the palm oil mill. The study also attempted to review the possibility to install a steam accumulator in the mill to stabilise the steam pressure fluctuations especially at the demand side...|$|R
40|$|Background: Good {{infection}} control practices {{are effective in}} reducing rates of infection in health care settings. Studies in primary care in developed countries indicate that many general practitioners (GPs) do not comply with optimal {{infection control}} practices. There are no published studies from developing countries in Southern Africa. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to describe infection control practices in private GP surgeries in the Buffalo City and OR Tambo District Municipalities in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Method: A literature review was conducted to appraise current best practice with respect to Standard Infection Control and Transmission Based Precautions. A questionnaire, inquiring into GPs’ actual practices, was posted to each surgery. Results: The valid response rate was 34 % (47 / 140). Methods used to sterilise instruments in 40 practices were: ultraviolet sterilisation (23), chemical disinfection (14), boiling water (7), and steam autoclave (2). Compounds used for chemical disinfection included organotin quaternary, chlorhexidine and benzyl ammonium chloride with a quaternary complex. Twenty-two (47 %) used a hand rub. Sixteen (35 %) GPs stated that they had a policy to promptly triage patients who are coughing, and 23 (50 %) had a policy for airflow movement in the surgery. All practices appropriately disposed of sharps. Thirty-seven (80 %) expressed interest in a seminar on infection control. Conclusions: Overall, GPs were aware of infection control precautions. Ultraviolet <b>sterilisers</b> and chlorhexidine are not recommended, however, for sterilisation or high level disinfection of medical instruments, and their use should be discontinued. Hand rubs are underutilised. GPs should implement Transmission Based Precautions to prevent airborne and droplet infections. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{potential}} for transmission of Perkinsus karlssoni, an apicomplexan parasite, among bivalve hosts, a long-term laboratory-scale, closed, artificial seawater system for shellfish was designed. Species of shellfish utilised were as follows: bay scallops, Argopecten irradians; blue mussels, Mytilus edulis; eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica; European oysters, Ostrea edulis; sea scallops, Placopecten megallanicus; softshell clams, Mya arenaria; and quahaugs, Mercenaria mercenaria. All shellfish used were juveniles with shell heights of 10 - 25 mm. The design was duplicated for control and experimental systems with a combined population of 1600 individual shellfish. The maximum biomass in each system was estimated at < 1 kg/m super(3). Each system included six, 400 litre rectangular fibreglass tanks, a modular pump and filter unit (particle and activated carbon filters and ultra-violet <b>sterilisers),</b> a biological filter and a refrigeration unit. The total volume of water for each system was 2300 litres of artificial seawater (Instant Ocean super(")). The mean water temperature of 22 degree C was achieved by thermostat-controlled room temperature. Salinity was maintained between 27 and 31 ppt by addition of either freshwater or artificial seawater. Shellfish were fed daily a mixed diet of carboy-cultured algae and spray-dried algae. Mean values for water quality parameters in both systems were as follows: NH sub(3) < 0. 004 mg/litre; NO sub(2) super(-) < 0. 01 mg/litre; NO sub(3) super(-) < 19 - 16 mg/litre; and pH 8. 0 - 8. 4. The system design was adequate in maintaining healthy bivalves {{for a period of}} 22 months, {{with the exception of the}} sea scallops which succumbed to warm water. Mean monthly shellfish survival rates were 79. 9 - 100 % in the control and 74. 8 - 98. 9 % in the experimental system.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to find an optimal process for a manually operated jacketed steam <b>steriliser,</b> which is mainly used in developing countries. The experiments were focussed on the steam penetration into a textile test pack and the drying procedure. The performance of the various test cycles was evaluated against the requirements in the European standards for large steam sterilisers and the validation of steam sterilisers, by measuring the temperature and pressure in the <b>steriliser</b> and textile test packs. The standard sterilisation process as recommended by the manufacturer of the steam <b>steriliser</b> did not fulfil the requirements by far and could not be considered as a proper sterilisation process. The optimum process for sterilisation of a worst case load (textile in top and bottom perforated sterilisation drums) was found to be: 20 minutes steam flushing at atmospheric pressure, three times a slow pressure build-up to 300 kPa followed by a drop to 100 kPa and finally a slow pressure build-up to the sterilisation pressure. This process has however not been proven suitable for the sterilisation of hollow medical devices. The optimum drying result was obtained by the use of an external condensation vessel. The condensation vessel also contributed to cost effective operation by it's simple design and low water consumption...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop dynamic mathematical models of the major energy use and recovery operations within the New Zealand meat industry. Ordinary differential equation based models were developed for the five most common rendering systems, for hot water use, generation and storage, and for the refrigeration system. These cover about 90 % of process heat use and about two-thirds of electricity demand. Each model was constructed so that ultimately it could be linked to the others to develop an integrated energy supply and demand model. Strong linkages to product flow were developed for the rendering models, but those for hot water and refrigeration are less developed, although there is no technological impediment. In developing the models for rendering it was assumed that cookers and dryers are perfectly mixed vessels and that time delays in materials transport are negligible. Model predictions could be improved by removing these assumptions, but taking into account the possible extent of data uncertainties, the present accuracy may be adequate for the overall meat plant energy model. A major consequence of the development of a hot water demand model was that areas of low efficiency were identified. By attention to equipment designs for hand tool <b>sterilisers</b> and cleanup systems substantial heat savings are possible. Although not tested, both the model for heat recovery and the model for hot water storage and supply are expected to be accurate as few major assumptions were required in their development. The main novel feature of the refrigeration model is that it treats the refrigeration applications in abstract terms rather than performing a room by room analysis. As a consequence data demands are lower than for refrigeration models which use a room-based approach, and the actual data needed are more easily obtainable. In spite of the lower data requirements good accuracy was demonstrated. The models developed will have major benefits to the NZ meat industry, initially as stand-alone entities, but later as an integrated package to help in reducing energy use...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} how dental handpieces are decontaminated and maintained in general dental practice. Design Observational survey. Setting The survey {{was carried out}} in general dental practice in Scotland. Survey visits ran from January 2003 until the end of March 2004. Methods Data were collected by interview and observation in 179 dental surgeries in Scotland. Results In virtually all surgeries, handpieces were cleaned before disinfection or autoclaving (99 %; n = 177), most commonly by wiping the external surface with a cloth impregnated with disinfectant. Most surgeries lubricated their handpieces after cleaning and before sterilisation (91 %; n = 162), although a number of surgeries (24 %; n = 42) also lubricated their handpieces after sterilisation. In the majority (97 %; n = 174) of dental surgeries, all handpieces were autoclaved after use, most frequently (89 %; n = 160) in a bowl and instrument <b>steriliser.</b> In 38 surgeries (21 %), handpieces were being wrapped (paper pouches) before sterilisation in bowl and instrument sterilisers. A minority of surgeries (20 %; n = 36) had a dedicated handpiece for surgical procedures. Conclusions The majority of dental handpieces are manually cleaned externally with a disinfectant impregnated cloth and processed in a type N (bowl and instrument) bench top steam <b>steriliser.</b> Handpieces are lubricated with non-water soluble lubricants at different stages of reprocessing, indicating clarification is required in this area.

For a wide range of curvature (De= 0 – 500), heat transfer, lethality development and thiamine concentration were analysed. Curvature and pseudoplasticity substantially increase heat transfer and render the axial velocity profile more uniform. As a result, processing times in heater, holder and cooler can be shorter, thus greatly improving thiamine retention. Significant lethality accumulated in the heating section, but the cooling section contributed very little to product sterility. Buoyant forces were shown to be of minor importance in coiled <b>steriliser</b> flow at the current process conditions...|$|E

40|$|The RIVM {{performed}} the helix {{test in the}} autoclaves of 20 hospitals. Only 59 % of the test results were positive, while the Bowie and Dick test was positive in all cases. The test helix added to a light instrument tray {{proved to be a}} particular challenge to the sterilisation process. One of the measures for infection prevention in hospital is the sterilisation of the surgical instruments by steam sterilisation. For this sterilisation method it is important that steam is able to get to all surfaces of the instruments and to penetrate into hollow instruments. European standardisation committee CEN TC 102 developed the helix test to demonstrate steam penetration into hollow devices. This method utilises a long narrow tube. Steam penetration throughout the length of the tube is demonstrated with an indicator {{at the end of the}} tube. This test method is essentially different from the currently used test method that utilises a textile pack; the Bowie and Dick test. Nowadays the vast majority of the hospitals do not sterilise textile packs, but there is a distinct increase in the number of hollow instruments that is reprocessed, eg. laparoscopic instruments. Hospitals should adopt their sterilisation indicators to the type of <b>steriliser</b> load and are advised to evaluate the performance of the sterilisers with the helix test added to a light instrument tray...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Ozone (03) {{is used as}} a <b>steriliser</b> of air and water, but the {{nitrogen}} oxides (NOx) are harmful to man and the environment. Ozone generators excite electrons to higher energy levels so that O 3 and NOx can be manufactured from oxygen and nitrogen in the air feed. The factors that influence the NOx production in domestic ozone generators, in particular Sterizone ozone generators were investigated, so that their design, operation and marketability could be improved. Sterizone ozone generators are designed with an exceptionally fast change in electrical field of 3 x 10 xy 8 V mm- 1 s- 1 with the aim of optimalising ozone production and decreasing NOx production. In this study it was found that Sterizone does produce NOx. After optimalising the analytical methods, the influence of the following reaction conditions on the production of O 3 and NOx by Sterizone was investigated: 1) Feed of synthetic air 2) Water vapour pressure of the feed gas 3) N 2 / 02 ratio of the feed gas 4) Contaminants in the air feed 5) C 02 in the air feed 6) Change in the frequency of the pulses 7) Temperature of the feed gas It was found that the Sterizone unit showed comparable properties with other ozone generators. High temperatures lower the ozone production so that the air feed must remain sufficiently high to prevent overheating which leads to high N 0,/ 03 ratios. The ozone production of Sterizone is dependent {{on the quality of the}} environmental air. Air humidity and contaminants like diesel fuel, ethanol, paraffin and xylene vapours lead to a drastic decrease in O 3 production. Carbon dioxide on the other hand causes a much smaller decrease in ozone production. No reaction conditions were found that led to a significant lowering of NO, production. The determination of nitrogen oxides was problematic and better analytical methods should be developed. It is recommended that an investigation is done into the possibility of removing {{the nitrogen}} oxides by means of an external filter or decreasing the product by means of ultraviolet radiation. The development of a more comprehensive theoretical model for the ozone formation processes will be beneficial to the optimalisation of ozone generators. Master...|$|E
