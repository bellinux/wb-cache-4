40|$|Spondylolysis is {{a common}} entity, a {{minority}} of people affected by this disease need medical care, {{and only a few}} require surgery. Reconstruction of the pars interarticularis is an interesting alternative to segmental fusion; this technique has the advantage of preserving segmental motion. Most authors report good results for young patients without intervertebral disk or facet degenerative changes. Moreover Louis also showed good to excellent results with his technique carried out among people who presented a satisfactory disk height (equal to two thirds of normal height). This could extend the number of patients for whom pars interarticularis repair could be proposed. In this study, the limit of reconstruction was set at grade 3 of the Pfirrmann’s classification. The fixation of the isthmus was done with a new kind of pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>hook</b> system. This stable and strong device is easy to use, allows an anatomic pars interarticularis reconstruction of spondylolysis and avoids a postoperative bracing. Twenty-three patients were assessed in this study, the mean age at operation was 34 (range 16 – 52  years) and the average follow-up was for 59  months (range 6 – 113  months). Eight patients showed moderate degenerative disk disease before the surgery and 12 patients had a grade 1 spondylolisthesis. The visual analogical scale, the Oswestry disability index (ODI) and the modified Prolo score were used for assessment of pain and clinical outcome before and after surgery. The results were from “excellent” to “good” for twenty patients (87 %) and “fair” for three of them (13 %). The consolidation of the isthmus was assessed {{at the end of the}} study (CT-scan); the fusion rate was observed in 91 %. Among patients aged less than 30  years results are from “good”, to “excellent” in all cases and consolidation was always observed. All of them showed normal disc signal before the surgery. In the group aged more than 30  years, the results varied from “good” to “excellent’ in 73 % and fusion of the defect was discovered in 82 % of cases. Eight of them (73 %) had moderate disk signal modification before the surgery. All people with fair results displayed moderate disk degeneration signs at MRI before surgery; but two of those three patients had a failure of defect consolidation too and it is also associated with poor results by several authors. No complication was found in this series. According to the good results reported by Louis and upto the current finding, the authors believe that pars interarticularis repair can be carried out on patients with moderate degenerative disk disease; the stage 3 of Pfirrmann’s classification seems a good limit. The Bone and joint research (B. J. R. system) is readily usable by any surgeon using pedicle screw systems and having a short learning curve. No device failure has been observed in this series...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of Cotrel–Dubousset instrumentation in 1984, the correction techniques in scoliosis surgery have changed from Harrington principles of concave distraction to segmental realignment {{to a variety of}} possibilities including the rod rotation manoeuvres, and to segmental approximation via cantilever methods. Additionally, pedicle screw utilization in lumbar curves enhanced correction and stabilization of various deformities, and various studies have strongly supported the clinical advantages of lumbar pedicle <b>screws</b> versus conventional <b>hook</b> instrumentation. Pedicle <b>screw</b> constructs have become increasingly popular in the treatment of patients with spinal deformity. When applied to adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients, pedicle screw fixation has demonstrated increased corrective ability compared with traditional hook/hybrid instrumentation. In our study, we do a retrospective review of idiopathic scoliosis patients (King 2 –Lenke 1 B/C) treated with a selective thoracic posterior fusion using an all-screw construct versus a hybrid (pedicle <b>screws</b> and <b>hooks)</b> construct and, compare the percentage of correction of the scoliotic curves obtained with screws alone and <b>screws</b> and <b>hooks.</b> Special attention was given to the rod diameter and correction technique. Our results show that the percentage of correction of idiopathic thoracic scoliosis is similar when treating the scoliosis with rods and screws alone or with rods, screws and hooks; therefore, we and the majority of authors in the literature do not consider the rod section. This can be an important parameter in the evaluation of the superiority of treatment with screws only or <b>screws</b> and <b>hooks.</b> In our study, even if not of statistical significance, the better thoracic curve correction obtained with the hybrid group should be ascribed to the fact that in this group mostly 6  mm rods were used...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This review {{discusses}} the basic knowledge and recent innovation of surgical treatment for scoliosis. Surgical treatment for scoliosis is indicated, in general, for a curve exceeding 45 to 50 degrees by the Cobb’s method {{on the basis}} that: 1. Curves larger than 50 degrees progress even after skeletal maturity. 2. Curves larger than 60 degrees cause loss of pulmonary function, and much larger curves cause respiratory failure. 3. Greater the curve progression, the more diffi cult it is to treat with surgery. Posterior fusion with instrumentation has been the standard form of surgical treatment for scoliosis. In modern instrumentation systems, more anchors are used to connect the rod and the spine, resulting in better correction and less frequent implant failures. Segmental pedicle screw constructs or hybrid constructs using pedicle <b>screws,</b> <b>hooks,</b> and wires are the trend of today. Anterior instrumentation surgery was once the choice of treatment for thoracolumbar and lumbar scoliosis because better correction could be obtained with shorter fusion levels. But in the recent times, superiority of anterior surgery for the tho-racolumbar and lumbar scoliosis has been questioned.

40|$|Background: Foreign {{bodies in}} the upper {{digestive}} tube are rarely the cause of an urgent condition in gastroenterology. They usually enter the digestive tube during nutrition or by mistake. However, certain groups of the population such as convicts or psychiatric patients tend to swallow them intentionally. The authors aim {{was to assess the}} percentage of patients in which urgent endoscopic investigation revealed true foreign {{bodies in the}} upper digestive tube, to evaluate the success of endoscopic procedures and the resolution of eventual complications. Patients and methods: The study includes patients in which urgent endoscopic investigations of the upper digestive tract were performed in a 10 -year period (1 January 1994 to 31 December 2003). Results: Altogether 6416 patients were investigated, mean age 59. 3 years, SD ± 17. 2 years, range 1 – 106 years, 2452 females and 3964 males. In 51 patients, 0. 8 % of all subjects, foreign bodies were detected in the esophagus or stomach. In these patients a total of 65 endoscopic investigations were performed, in 94 % the foreign bodies were removed endoscopically (48 / 51 patients), in three cases the endoscopic procedures were not successful. Among the foreign bodies removed were various metal or plastic objects: coins, keys, <b>screws,</b> <b>hooks,</b> batteries, razor blades, needles, parts of kitchen, toilet or writing utensils, lighters, buttons, toys, a toothbrush as well as impacted pieces of bone. In the patients with successful endoscopic removal of the objects, no significant complications were noted. In 3 patients (3 / 48, 6. 3 %) only mild hemorrhages from the region of the esophagogastric junction were observed. Conclusions: The technological development of endoscopic instruments made it possible to carry out different therapeutic procedures. The method has proved successful in removing foreign bodies from the upper digestive tube. Various factors affect the success of the procedure, the more important being adequate equipment, the experience and patience of the investigator and the assisting nurse, as well as the patient’s understanding of the procedure and his or her cooperation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this review, basic {{knowledge}} and recent innovation of surgical treatment for scoliosis will be described. Surgical treatment for scoliosis is indicated, in general, for the curve exceeding 45 or 50 degrees by the Cobb's method {{on the ground}} that: 1) Curves larger than 50 degrees progress even after skeletal maturity. 2) Curves of greater magnitude cause loss of pulmonary function, and much larger curves cause respiratory failure. 3) Larger the curve progress, more difficult to treat with surgery. Posterior fusion with instrumentation has been a standard of the surgical treatment for scoliosis. In modern instrumentation systems, more anchors are used to connect the rod and the spine, resulting in better correction and less frequent implant failures. Segmental pedicle screw constructs or hybrid constructs using pedicle <b>screws,</b> <b>hooks,</b> and wires are the trend of today. Anterior instrumentation surgery had been a choice of treatment for the thoracolumbar and lumbar scoliosis because better correction can be obtained with shorter fusion levels. Recently, superiority of anterior surgery for the thoracolumbar and lumbar scoliosis has been lost. Initial enthusiasm for anterior instrumentation for the thoracic curve using video assisted thoracoscopic surgery technique has faded out. Various attempts are being made with use of fusionless surgery. To control growth, epiphysiodesis on the convex side of the deformity with or without instrumentation is a technique to provide gradual progressive correction and to arrest {{the deterioration of the}} curves. To avoid fusion for skeletally immature children with spinal cord injury or myelodysplasia, vertebral wedge ostetomies are performed for the treatment of progressive paralytic scoliosis. For right thoracic curve with idiopathic scoliosis, multiple vertebral wedge osteotomies without fusion are performed. To provide correction and maintain it during the growing years while allowing spinal growth for early onset scoliosis, technique of instrumentation without fusion or with limited fusion using dual rod instrumentation has been developed. To increase the volume of the thorax in thoracic insufficiency syndrome associated with fused ribs and congenital scoliosis, vertical expandable prosthetic titanium ribs has been developed. </p...|$|R

30|$|The {{conventional}} {{fixation device}} used for C 1 -C 2 fusion was a wiring procedure described by Gallie (1937, 1939) McGraw & Rusch (1973) and Brooks & Jenkins (1978).

With the intent of further improving fixation properties and {{eliminating the need for}} a concomitant structural bone graft, newer methods utilizing fixation of C 1 with the lateral mass <b>screw</b> and <b>hook</b> system have been developed and are commonly used in our current clinical practice. Although the advent of these fixation systems has reduced surgery-related morbidity and improved surgical outcome, introduction of novel surgical systems may result in complications that have not been encountered with the conventional procedures.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{determine}} the predictors of serum chromium levels after stainless steel posterior spinal instrumentation for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Abnormally elevated serum chromium levels {{have been detected}} in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis after stainless steel instrumentation. To date, the relationship among serum chromium levels, time of implantation, and implant characteristics (including surface area, rod length, numbers of <b>hooks,</b> <b>screws,</b> and cross connectors) has not been studied. METHODS. Thirty patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis undergoing posterior instrumented spinal arthrodesis using stainless steel implants between 1998 and 2002 were prospectively studied. Serum chromium levels were measured between October 2006 and June 2007. Postoperative radiographs were used to measure rod lengths, number of <b>hooks,</b> <b>screws,</b> cross-connectors, and cables. The surface area of each component and the total surface area for each patient were calculated. Possible associations between serum chromium levels, time of implantation, and implant characteristics were investigated. RESULTS. Implant exposure, whether expressed {{in the form of}} total metal implant surface area, rod length, or number of metal interfaces, was found to be positively associated with serum chromium levels. Specifically, chromium levels increased by a multiplicative factor of 1. 0060 for every additional square centimeter of total metal implant surface area (P = 0. 02). In addition, the chromium level was found to decrease by a multiplicative factor of 0. 7766 for every additional year since surgery (P = 0. 02). CONCLUSION. After adjusting for the number of years since surgery, metal implant exposure is positively associated with elevated serum chromium levels in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients with stainless steel posterior spinal implants. This is the first study to identify statistically significant positive associations between specific spinal implant characteristics (other than corrosion identified by radiographs) and serum chromium levels.

40|$|Lumbar {{arthrodesis}} or spinal fusion {{is usually}} performed to relieve back pain and regain functionality from ruptured discs, disc degenerative disease, trauma and scoliosis. Metal rods are often {{fixed to the}} spine with <b>screws</b> or <b>hooks,</b> while fusion develops on the affected vertebrae. Fusion is determined by visual examination of radiographic images (X-ray), computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), yet these inspection procedures are subjective methods of review. They do not objectively confirm the presence of spinal fusion, {{which can lead to}} exploratory surgery to determine if fusion has occurred. Therefore, a need has arisen to develop an objective method that will offer unbiased information for the determination of fusion. Discussed herein is a housing and sensor designed to be used in conjunction with telemetric circuitry that will attach to the spinal instrumentation rods. The housing will transmit strain to an internatal capacitive MEMS-based sensor that will relay strain magnitudes via telemetry. Observed reductions of bending strain will indicate a successful fusion. These objective assessments will reduce the incidence of costly exploratory surgeries where fusion is in question. The housing design was fabricated using Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) material, which was selected for its physical properties and its ability to be implanted for long durations.

40|$|Background: Upper {{cervical}} instability {{is common}} in many skeletal dysplasias, and surgical treatment can be difficult because of small, fragile osseous elements. In this study of children with skeletal dysplasia and upper cervical instability, we compared fusion rates and complications between (1) patients treated with no instrumentation or with wiring tech-niques and (2) those who underwent rigid cervical spine instrumentation. We also sought to characterize the presentation and common parameters of upper cervical instability in this population. Methods: A multicenter study identified twenty-eight children with skeletal dysplasia who underwent surgery from 2000 through 2011 for C 1 -C 2 instability and were followed {{for a minimum of}} two years. Fourteen children were treated with no instrumentation or with instrumentation with wires or cables (nonrigid-fixation group) and fourteen were treated with <b>screws</b> (or <b>hooks)</b> and rods (rigid-fixation group).

30|$|The {{advantages}} of extending spinal fusion to the sacrum and pelvis in scoliosis surgery are considerable, providing greater stability and further limiting progression of deformity. This {{approach has been}} attempted {{since the beginning of}} spinal deformity surgery, even prior to the use of metallic stabilization [1, 2, 3, 4]. With the use of internal fixation, many methods for extending fusion to the sacrum have been attempted, mainly by placing the metal rods within the sacrum and/or ilium or attaching them to bone by <b>screw</b> or <b>hook</b> fixation [1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. As rigidity increased from extensive thoracolumbar stabilization, increasing stress was placed on the lumbosacral junction and on pelvic fixation devices, especially if limited to the sacrum. Results extending fusion to the pelvis improved, but the complication rate with infection, pain, less than full fusion, instrument failure, and metallic pullout was high, often approaching 40 – 50  % rates of pseudarthrosis [1, 5, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. In scoliosis surgery, in situ fusion and prolonged immobilization to achieve lumbosacral fusion is of historical interest, but currently has no place in attaining fusion at the lumbosacral junction which requires instrumentation to increase the fusion rate [1]. Several studies have assessed the complex anatomy of the pelvis [1, 5, 16] and the biomechanical aspects of fusion to the sacrum [1, 5, 8, 16, 23, 24]. In some neuromuscular patients, particularly with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), many surgeons have extended the fusion only to L 5 in those with relatively mild deformity, bypassing pelvic concerns [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36].|$|R

Two weeks later, she started gait exercise with immobilization by a rigid orthosis. Twenty-five days later, she presented with paralysis and numbness of her legs. Computed tomography (CT) showed anterior expansion in the vertebral body of Th 10. MRI showed an intramedullary high-intensity area on T 2 -weighted images at the same level. She was diagnosed as having delayed paraplegia after a Th 10 fracture and transferred to our hospital for surgery. Laminectomy of Th 10, posterior fusion from Th 7 to L 1 with pedicle <b>screws</b> and <b>hooks</b> to Th 6 and L 1 laminae, anterior fusion from Th 9 to Th 11 with a plate, and autologous bone grafting were performed simultaneously.

At 8 days after surgery, she again presented with low back pain and paralysis in her legs. CT revealed an L 1 fracture, which was the caudal end of the surgical fusion. The decreased kyphosis after surgery compared to that at pre-injury might have caused a subsequent horizontal shear force to L 1 when the patient sat on the bed and when she walked.

In all animals, we found that during tidal inspirations performed with the inspiratory intercostals alone, 1) the rib cage moved outward while the abdomen moved inward; 2) the rib cage was displaced near its relaxation curve (defined by a plot of its transverse vs. anteroposterior diameter) but expanded more in its transverse than in its anteroposterior dimension; and 3) the ribs in the midaxillary line moved cephalad, whereas the sternum was displaced caudally. Additional experiments performed on four dogs demonstrated that contraction of the parasternal intercostals was responsible for the inspiratory caudal displacement of the sternum. These findings indicate that in the dog, 1) the inspiratory intercostals act essentially on the lateral walls of the rib cage, and 2) those of the parasternal area produce a caudal displacement of the sternum. In addition, they suggest strongly that the axial displacement of the sternum constitutes an additional degree of freedom of motion of the rib cage and that contraction of the neck accessory muscles is mandatory for the sternum to be displaced in a cephalad direction during inspiration.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the action of}} the neck accessory muscles on the rib cage, we stimulated the sternocleidomastoid and the scalenus muscles separately in supine anesthetized dogs. <b>Hooks</b> <b>screwed</b> into the sternum and ribs were used to measure their axial displacements and the changes in anteroposterior (AP) and transverse (T) diameters of the rib cage. We found that the sternocleidomastoid and scalenus muscles, when they contract alone, cause a large axial displacement of the sternum and the ribs in a cephalad direction and expand the rib cage along both its AP and T diameters. Opening the abdomen increased the cephalad displacement of the ribs and the expansion of the lower rib cage, particularly along its T diameter, but reduced the increase in lung volume. These experiments indicate 1) that {{the action of the}} sternocleidomastoid and scalenus muscles on the rib cage is essentially the consequence of a rotation of the ribs' neck axes, resulting from the cephalad displacement of the ribs, and 2) that the fall in abdominal pressure, almost certainly by acting through the zone of apposition of the diaphragm to the rib cage, has a deflationary action on the lower rib cage, more markedly so on its lateral than its anterior wall. The experiments also suggest that the fall in abdominal pressure prevents the diaphragm from moving cephalad and aids the neck accessory muscles in inflating the lungs.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN. : Prospective clinical-radiographic study. OBJECTIVES. : To {{investigate}} the natural coupling behavior between frontal deformity correction and the simultaneous changes in thoracic kyphosis, {{and to examine}} how the postoperative thoracic sagittal realignment relates to this natural coupling behavior. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. : Restoration of the sagittal alignment {{is one of the}} fundamental goals in scoliosis correction surgery. It is generally achieved by rod precontouring intraoperatively. However, clinical studies suggested that postoperative sagittal realignment seems to be more affected by the inherent properties of the spine rather than the instrumentation or the surgical maneuver. METHODS. : Ninety-eight idiopathic scoliosis patients with thoracic curves treated with one-stage posterior spinal fusion, using corrective segmental spinal instrumentation (hook-rod or pedicle screw-rod constructs) were investigated. Pre- and postoperative frontal and sagittal alignments were measured by standing anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. Preoperative frontal plane flexibility was assessed by the fulcrum bending radiograph in the standard manner, an additional radiograph was taken in the lateral plane, to assess how this frontal correction force affects sagittal plane alignment (lateral fulcrum bending radiograph). RESULTS. : When thoracic frontal deformity was corrected under fulcrum bending, coupled changes in the thoracic kyphosis demonstrated 3 different patterns: thoracic kyphosis increased in 25 patients with a mean kyphosis of 9 ° to 19 °, decreased in 45 with a mean of 34 ° to 21 ° and remained unchanged (within 3 °) in 28 with a mean of 19 ° to 18 °. After surgery, the direction of correction of thoracic kyphosis significantly correlated with the coupling patterns demonstrated on fulcrum bending radiographs (r = 0. 579, P < 0. 001). However, the actual postoperative thoracic kyphosis angle cannot be predicted by the preoperative lateral fulcrum bending radiograph. There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0. 263) between using pedicle <b>screws</b> and <b>hooks</b> in achieving the additional correction beyond what was demonstrated on the lateral fulcrum bending radiographs. CONCLUSION. : Changes in thoracic kyphosis on fulcrum bending due to natural coupling of deformities are directed towards "self-normalization. " There is no difference in the sagittal plane deformity correction with the use of hook-rod system or pedicle screw-rod constructs. This {{can be used as a}} guideline for exact preoperative rod contouring to reduce the stress on the bone-implant interface and the rate of postoperative failures. The findings also suggest that it is not how big or strong the implants are, but rather the natural curve behavior will at least partially determine the final sagittal outcome. © 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Pedicle hooks {{which are}} used as an {{anchorage}} for posterior spinal instrumentation may be subjected to considerable three-dimensional forces. In order to achieve stronger attachment to the implantation site, <b>hooks</b> using <b>screws</b> for additional fixation have been developed. The failure loads and mechanisms of three such devices have been experimentally determined on human thoracic vertebrae: the Universal Spine System (USS) pedicle <b>hook</b> with one <b>screw,</b> a prototype pedicle <b>hook</b> with two <b>screws</b> and the Cotrel-Dubousset (CD) pedicle <b>hook</b> with <b>screw.</b> The USS <b>hooks</b> use 3. 2 -mm self-tapping fixation screws which pass into the pedicle, whereas the CD hook is stabilised with a 3 -mm set screw pressing against the superior part of the facet joint. A clinically established 5 -mm pedicle screw was tested for comparison. A matched pair experimental design was implemented to evaluate these implants in constrained (series I) and rotationally unconstrained (series II) posterior pull-out tests. In the constrained tests the pedicle screw was the strongest implant, with an average pull-out force of 1650 N (SD 623 N). The prototype hook was comparable, with an average failure load of 1530 N (SD 414 N). The average pull-out force of the USS <b>hook</b> with one <b>screw</b> was 910 N (SD 243 N), not significantly different to the CD hook's average failure load of 740 N (SD 189 N). The result of the unconstrained tests were similar, with the prototype hook being the strongest device (average 1617 N, SD 652 N). However, in this series the difference in failure load between the USS <b>hook</b> with one <b>screw</b> and the CD hook was significant. Average failure loads of 792 N (SD 184 N) for the USS hook and 464 N (SD 279 N) for the CD hook were measured. A pedicular fracture in {{the plane of the}} fixation screw was the most common failure mode for USS hooks. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Spinal {{deformities}} in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome {{are usually}} progressive and may require operative treatment. There is {{limited number of}} studies describing late results of surgery in this disease. Methods This is a retrospective study of the records of 11 patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, treated surgically between 1990 and 2007. All patients underwent surgical treatment for spinal deformity. Duration of operation, type of instrumentation, intraoperative blood loss, complications and number of additional surgeries were noted. Radiographic measurement was performed on standing AP and lateral radiographs acquired before surgery, just after and at final follow up. Results The mean follow up period was 5. 5 ± 2. 9 years (range 1 - 10 years). The mean preoperative thoracic and lumbar curve were 109. 5 ± 19. 9 ° (range 83 ° - 142 °) and 75. 6 ± 26. 7 ° (range 40 ° - 108 °) respectively. Posterior spine fusion alone was performed on 6 patients and combined anterior and posterior fusion (one- or two stage) on 5 cases. Posterior segmental spinal instrumentation was applied with use of <b>hooks,</b> <b>screws</b> and wires. The mean postoperative thoracic and lumbar curve improved to 79. 3 ± 16. 1 ° (range 56 ° - 105 °) and 58. 5 ± 27. 7 ° (range 10 ° - 95 °) respectively, with a slight loss of correction during follow up. The average thoracic and lumbar correction was 26. 4 ± 14. 9 % (range 5. 3 - 50. 4 %) and 26. 3 ± 21. 2 % (range 7. 9 - 75 %). Postoperatively, the mean kyphosis was 79. 5 ± 40. 3 ° (range 21 ° - 170 °), and lordosis was 50. 8 ± 18. 6 ° (range 20 ° - 79 °). Hyperkyphosis increased during follow up while lordosis remained stable. Mean Th 12 -L 2 angle was - 3. 5 ± 9. 9 ° (range - 19 ° - 15 °) postoperatively and did not change significantly during follow up. Conclusions Huge spinal deformities in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome require complex and extensive surgery. There is a big risk of sagittal imbalance in this group. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Acromioclavicular {{injuries}} {{are common in}} sports medicine. Surgical intervention is generally advocated for chronic instability of Rockwood grade III and more severe injuries. Various methods of coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction and augmentation have been described. The objective {{of this study is}} to compare the biomechanical properties of a novel palmaris-longus tendon reconstruction with those of the native AC+CC ligaments, the modified Weaver-Dunn reconstruction, the ACJ capsuloligamentous complex repair, <b>screw</b> and clavicle <b>hook</b> plate augmentation. Hypothesis There is no difference, biomechanically, amongst the various reconstruction and augmentative methods. Study Design Controlled laboratory cadaveric study. Methods 54 cadaveric native (acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular) ligaments were tested using the Instron machine. Superior loading was performed in the 6 groups: 1) in the intact states, 2) after modified Weaver-Dunn reconstruction (WD), 3) after modified Weaver-Dunn reconstruction with acromioclavicular joint capsuloligamentous repair (WD. ACJ), 4) after modified Weaver-Dunn reconstruction with clavicular hook plate augmentation (WD. CP) or 5) after modified Weaver-Dunn reconstruction with coracoclavicular screw augmentation (WD. BS) and 6) after modified Weaver-Dunn reconstruction with mersilene tape-palmaris-longus tendon graft reconstruction (WD. PLmt). Posterior-anterior (horizontal) loading was similarly performed in all groups, except groups 4 and 5. The respective failure loads, stiffnesses, displacements at failure and modes of failure were recorded. Data analysis was carried out using a one-way ANOVA, with Student's unpaired t-test for unpaired data (S-PLUS statistical package 2005). Results Native ligaments were the strongest and stiffest when compared to other modes of reconstruction and augmentation except coracoclavicular screw, in both posterior-anterior and superior directions (p WD. ACJ provided additional posterior-anterior (P = 0. 039) but not superior (p = 0. 250) stability when compared to WD alone. WD+PLmt, in loads and stiffness at failure superiorly, was similar to WD+CP (p = 0. 066). WD+PLmt, in loads and stiffness at failure postero-anteriorly, was similar to WD+ACJ (p = 0. 084). Superiorly, WD+CP had similar strength as WD+BS (p = 0. 057), but it was less stiff (p Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Modified Weaver-Dunn procedure must always be supplemented with acromioclavicular capsuloligamentous repair to increase posterior-anterior stability. Palmaris-Longus tendon graft provides both additional superior and posterior-anterior stability when used for acromioclavicular capsuloligamentous reconstruction. It is a good alternative to clavicle hook plate in acromioclavicular dislocation. </p...|$|R
40|$|In the nineties, most spinal {{surgeons}} {{supported the}} validity of segmental spine instrumentation, but this procedure has progressively been abandoned because difficult and with {{a high risk of}} neurological complications, in favor of the Cotrel-Dobousset (CD). The CD instrumentation is based on segmentation of curves, thus improving the angular correction and actuates sagittal profile. Sublaminar acrylic loops (Universal Clamp) shows the same resistance to stress as steel or titanium alloy sublaminar wires. The simple procedure and the tensioning of the strips allows re-tensioning and progressive correction. The increased contact area, improves corrective forces, thus reducing the risk of laminar fractures. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify {{the validity of}} this spinal fixation implant in the surgical treatment of a consecutive series of patients affected by neurologic scoliosis. The authors treated surgically 84 patients affected by neurologic scoliosis with an average age of 14  years (range 10 – 17). Universal Clamps associated with Socore TM spinal assembly, transpedicular lumbar <b>screws</b> and thoracic <b>hooks</b> at the upper end of the curve were used. The etiology of disease was cerebral palsy in 81 cases, Friedreich ataxia in two cases and Aicardi syndrome in one case. The average preoperative angular value was 73 ° ±  16 °. It was implanted a mean of seven Clamps for each procedure (range 5 – 9). The average percentage of correction was 72 %. Mean operative time was 240  ±  30  min with mean blood loss of 1200  ±  400  ml. No intra-operative complications occurred. Mean follow-up was 36  months. At one-year follow-up the mean loss of correction was 7 ° ±  2 ° with no re-intervention required. This is the first report on treatment of neurological scoliosis with this hybrid construct (lumbar screws, thoracic acrylic clamps, thoracic hooks at the upper end of the curve). In this group of patients the Universal Clamps technique appeared safe and effective and its mechanical performance is comparable to all-level screws construct. Furthermore, the kyphotic component can be better managed in case of thoracic lordosis. The most important aspect of this technique is a short operative time and low vascular and neurologic risks combined with a satisfying stability in the short-postoperative period. Nevertheless, it is important to value results on a long-term follow-up to analyze correction loss, pseudoarthrosis, and mechanical failure of the strips...|$|R
