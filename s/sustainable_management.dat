5|$|Since re-foundation in 2004, S.S.C. Napoli S.p.A. has a <b>sustainable</b> <b>management</b> strategy. The {{club has}} one of the largest {{supporting}} groups in Italy (fourth, behind Juventus and Milan teams) which was the main source of income, in terms of gate revenue and TV rights. Except the first few seasons, Napoli made an aggregate profit in successive years: in 2004–05 and 2005–06 season the net loss were €7,061,463 and €9,088,780. In 2006–07 Serie B, Napoli made its first profit of €1,416,976 The first Serie A season back Napoli had a net profit of €11,911,041 It followed with a net profit of €10,934,520, due to the income from European matches which was offset by the increase in cost. In 2009–10 season, Napoli heavily invested on players, and made that season a net profit of just €343,686. In 2010–11 Serie A, Napoli returned to the right track with €4,197,829 net profit. It was due to the new collective TV rights of Serie A, as well as qualification to 2010–11 UEFA Europa League.|$|E

40|$|Sustainably managed music festivals have {{significant}} value and {{can provide a}} multitude of benefits to a healthy, sustainable and desirable society if their negative impacts are mitigated and positive impacts cultivated. To reach this great potential, <b>sustainable</b> event <b>management</b> of music festivals must become widely adopted and expanded as common practice. To drive this improvement of <b>sustainable</b> event <b>management,</b> {{there is a need}} to first understand the barriers and success factors event organizers face moving their music festivals toward sustainability. This study uses a research design of mixed quantitative-qualitative methods: a survey of thirty diverse music festival organizers across the United States and interviews with five selected survey participants. Research draws on pertinent literature from sustainability theory and practice, previous research on <b>sustainable</b> event <b>management,</b> existing strategies of sustainable events, and lessons from organizational change studies. Findings revealed seven key barriers and four success factors associated with <b>sustainable</b> event <b>management</b> of music festivals as well as three specific needs of event organizers to improve <b>sustainable</b> event <b>management.</b> With these findings, seven strategies are presented to help event organizers adopt and improve <b>sustainable</b> event <b>management</b> of music festivals. This study is significant because it fills an important gap in the academic literature on events and sustainability.

40|$|In this paper, <b>sustainable</b> forest <b>management</b> is {{discussed}} within {{the historical and}} theoretical framework of the sustainable development debate. The various criteria and indicators for <b>sustainable</b> forest <b>management</b> put forth by different institutions are critically explored. Specific types of climate change mitigation policies/projects in the forest sector are identified and examined {{in the light of}} the general criteria for <b>sustainable</b> forest <b>management.</b> Areas of compatibility and contradiction between the climate mitigation objectives and the minimum criteria for <b>sustainable</b> forest <b>management</b> are identified and discussed. Emphasis is put on the problems of monitoring and verifying carbon benefits associated with such projects given their impacts on pre-existing policy objectives on <b>sustainable</b> forest <b>management.</b> The implications of such policy interactions on assignment of carbon credits from forest projects under Joint Implementation/Activities Implemented Jointly initiatives are discussed. The paper concludes that a comprehensive monitoring and verification regime must include an impact assessment on the criteria covered under other agreements such as the Biodiversity and/or Desertification Conventions.
