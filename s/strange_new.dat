5|$|The {{history of}} botanical gardens is {{closely linked to}} the history of botany itself. The botanical gardens of the 16th and 17th centuries were {{medicinal}} gardens, but the idea of a botanical garden changed to encompass displays of the beautiful, <b>strange,</b> <b>new</b> and sometimes economically important plant trophies being returned from the European colonies and other distant lands. Later, in the 18th century, they became more educational in function, demonstrating the latest plant classification systems devised by botanists working in the associated herbaria as they tried to order these new treasures. Then, in the 19th and 20th centuries, the trend was towards a combination of specialist and eclectic collections demonstrating many aspects of both horticulture and botany.|$|E

25|$|It {{was here}} that Carl started {{composing}} his first songs {{with an eye toward}} the future. Watching the dance floor at all times for a reaction, working out a more rhythmically driving style of music that was neither country nor blues, but had elements of both, Perkins kept reshaping these loosely structured songs until he had a completed composition, which would then be finally put to paper. Carl was already sending demos to New York record companies, who kept rejecting him, sometimes explaining that this <b>strange</b> <b>new</b> style of country with a pronounced rhythm fit no current commercial trend. That would change in 1955 after recording the song 'Blue Suede Shoes' (recorded 19 December 1955). Later made more famous by Elvis Presley, Perkins' original version was an early rock 'n' roll standard.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1870s to early 1880s, spread of arc lighting, {{a type of}} {{brilliant}} outdoor street lighting that required high voltages {{in the range of}} 3000-6000 volts, was followed by one story after another in newspapers about how the high voltages used were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a <b>strange</b> <b>new</b> phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead without leaving a mark. One of these accidents, in Buffalo, New York on August 7, 1881, led to the inception of the electric chair. That evening a drunken dock worker, looking for the thrill of a tingling sensation he had noticed before, managed to sneak his way into a Brush Electric Company arc lighting power house and grabbed the brush and ground of a large electric dynamo. He died instantly. The coroner who investigated the case brought it up at a local Buffalo scientific society. Another member, Alfred P. Southwick, a dentist who had a technical background, thought some application could be found for the curious phenomenon.|$|E

500|$|In The Ends of Literature, Brett Levinson {{writes that}} magical realism, [...] "a key {{aesthetic}} mode within recent Latin American fiction ... materializes when Latin American history reveals itself as incapable of accounting {{for its own}} origin, an incapacity which traditionally ... represents a demand for a myth: mythos {{as a means to}} explain the beginnings which escape history's narrative." [...] The writings of the Chroniclers of the Indies depicted the exotic [...] "new world" [...] and their accounts of conquering <b>strange</b> <b>new</b> lands became accepted as history. [...] These often fantastical stories helped to bring about a new aesthetic, which morphed into magical realism and [...] "(as conceived by Alejo Carpentier) marvelous realism or lo real maravilloso. According to this aesthetic, unreal things are treated as if realistic and mundane, and mundane things as if unreal. Plots, while often based on real experiences, incorporate strange, fantastic, and legendary elements, mythical peoples, speculative settings, and characters who, while plausible, could also be unreal, and combine the true, the imaginary, and the nonexistent {{in such a way that}} they are difficult to separate." ...|$|E
500|$|Justin Joffe, {{writing for}} the New York Observer, praised the album as [...] "a {{stunning}} display of naked vulnerability and a notable achievement ... Radiohead remain dedicated craftsmen of <b>strange</b> <b>new</b> sonic universes." [...] Like Joffe, Nina Corcoran of Consequence of Sound praised the inclusion of older songs such as [...] "True Love Waits", writing: [...] "Waiting five years to hear previously released tracks is worth it precisely because Radiohead finally feels connected enough to perform them with meaning ... waiting to release a studio recording of a song over two decades old allowed Radiohead to peel its words when riper than ever." [...] Mike Diver of the Quietus, however, felt the inclusion of older songs gave the album the unwelcome feeling of a compilation album, writing: [...] "Certain tracks feel less than fully fleshed out, really given the treatment that their age warrants ... There's simply so little spark here, barely glowing embers and blackened dust where once Radiohead blazed a fascinating, furious trail for others to attempt to follow." ...|$|E
500|$|During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans {{from the}} low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone {{to that of a}} [...] "child whisperer" [...] due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it [...] "a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an {{identity}} crisis". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including [...] "When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing [...] "Shine!" [...] and Williams screaming [...] "Hey!". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, [...] "So we're in a <b>strange</b> <b>new</b> land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation" [...] and [...] "that bear with the red hat", as obvious references to Paddington. According to Sannwald, the lyrics include [...] "Pharrell's 'Happy"-ish 'Everybody is the same inside' bridge" [...] that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents [...] "without sounding overly patronizing". [...] "Shine" [...] ends with Williams singing in the falsetto register.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{the sequel}} was {{conceived}} at one of Marvel's semi-annual editorial retreats. Axel Alonso, editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, stated that unlike other major comic book storylines which take years of planning, he only had {{three to four months}} to plan [...] "Civil War II". This abbreviated timetable was necessary in order to capitalize on the release of the feature film , which was released in May 2016. According to the official synopsis, a <b>strange</b> <b>new</b> character with the power to accurately predict the outcome of future events comes {{to the attention of the}} world. This power divides the heroes on how best to utilize the information, with Captain Marvel wanting to profile future crimes before they occur, and Iron Man believing that [...] "the punishment cannot come before the crime." [...] The situation reaches a turning point when it is predicted that one of the heroes will be the cause of major destruction, forcing the others to make a difficult decision. Bendis said, [...] "People's personal accountability is the theme of this one... from the way cops are acting on camera, to the way people talk to each other online." [...] The plot for [...] "Civil War II" [...] began to develop in the second volume of The Invincible Iron Man, which is also written by Bendis and drawn by Marquez.|$|E
500|$|The Questor Tapes [...] project reunited {{him with}} his Star Trek collaborator, Gene L. Coon, who was in failing health at the time. NBC ordered 16 episodes, and {{tentatively}} scheduled the series to follow The Rockford Files on Friday nights; the pilot launched on January 23, 1974, to positive critical response, but Roddenberry balked at the substantial changes requested by the network and left the project, leading to its immediate cancellation. During 1974, Roddenberry reworked the Genesis II concept as a second pilot, Planet Earth, for rival network ABC, with similar less-than-successful results. The pilot was aired on April 23, 1974. While Roddenberry wanted to create something that could feasibly exist in the future, the network wanted stereotypical science-fiction women and were unhappy when that was not delivered. Roddenberry {{was not involved in}} a third reworking of the material by ABC that produced <b>Strange</b> <b>New</b> World. He began developing MAGNA I, an underwater science-fiction series, for 20th Century Fox Television. By the time the work on the script was complete, though, those who had approved the project had left Fox and their replacements were not interested in the project. A similar fate was faced by Tribunes, a science-fiction police series, which Roddenberry attempted to get off the ground between 1973 and 1977. He gave up after four years; the series never even reached the pilot stage.|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Life" [...] was raved {{by music}} critics. John Calvert of The Quietus {{described}} the song as [...] "really big. Like R. Kelly's [...] "I Believe I Can Fly" [...] big. Like Superman eating a super hotdog while fighting King Kong while...ok {{you get the}} picture. If you were looking around for a high concept pitch-style descriptor, with its synth brass and Philly soul strings {{you might call it}} 'Stevie Wonder meets N.E.R.D in space'. But then that would be too simplistic a definition for the multifaceted, resolutely accomplished 'Sweet Thing'." [...] Pitchforks Larry Fitzmaurice labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and noted that [...] "this was a week where Frank Ocean bravely invited us to learn more about his personal story; 'Sweet Life' is another reminder of how well he can structure a narrative in the musical realm." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick noted that Ocean took the R genre and pushed it out into <b>strange</b> <b>new</b> places, with tracks like the [...] "blissful, jazzy jigsaw of 'Sweet Life', which seems to assemble itself from disconnected elements as it goes along." [...] AllMusic's Andy Kellman mused that the track served as one of the album's lighter moments, and wrote that [...] "the bright 'Sweet Life' and the relatively exuberant 'Monks,' both of which would be standouts on any N.E.R.D. album, offer more than bright coating, dealing in surrealism and sharp observations that are equally penetrating." ...|$|E
