40|$|We study quantum analogues of {{quotient}} varieties, namely quantum grassmannians and quantum determinantal rings, {{from the}} point of view of regularity conditions. More precisely, we show that these rings are AS-Cohen-Macaulay and determine which of them are AS-Gorenstein. Our method is inspired by the one developed by De Concini, Eisenbud and Procesi in the commutative case. Thus, we introduce and study the notion of a quantum graded algebra with a <b>staightening</b> law on a partially ordered set, showing in particular that, among such algebras, those whose underlying poset is wonderful are AS-Cohen-Macaulay. Then, we prove that both quantum grassmannians and quantum determinantal rings are quantum graded algebras with a <b>staightening</b> law on a wonderful poset, hence showing that they are AS-Cohen-Macaulay. In this last step, we are lead to introduce and study (to some extent) natural quantum analogues of Schubert varieties. Comment: 29 page...|$|E
40|$|Two {{batches of}} tubes of Zr 1 Nb and of Zry- 4 W were {{oxidized}} for 30 days at 425 °C in steam, and for 360 days at 500 °C in air, respectively. The {{analysis of the}} I-V characteristics at constant temperatures up to 220 °C of oxide layers of nearly equal thickness gave an activation energy of 1, 3 eV for the grey homogeneous steam samples, and of 0. 4 eV for the white surface layer, and of 1. 3 eV at temperatures over 140 °C, for the grey bottom layer of the air samples, respectively. The I-V characteristics were sub-linear in the air samples, the current growing less at rising voltages, but <b>staightening</b> to super-linear space-charge limited currents at higher temperatures. The injection currents flowing when voltage was applied did not reach constant equilibrium, but at a bend, continued with a lesser slope. The resistivity was about one order of magnitude greater in air samples and greater in Zry- 4 W. The relative permittivity was greater in the steam samples and greater in Zr 1 Nb. The currents of the air samples were greater with Au electrodes than with Ag electrodes. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{minimize}} eddy currents, {{induced by}} the rising magnetic field, the chamber was made from thin stainless steel of high specific electric resistance. For mechanical stength, it was corrugated in a hydro-forming process. The chamber is curved, to follow the beam's orbital path. Under vacuum, the chamber tends to <b>staighten,</b> the ceramic spacer along half of its length keeps it in place (see also 7402458) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{belongs to}} a branch of health {{physical}} education. It closely describes the identification and verification of postural defects of 13 -year-old pupils in České Budějovice. The measures determining a defective posture {{as well as the}} tests of some muscular categories were done. Based on their results a set of remedial exercises was made. These were applied in practice. I chose them to influence muscular imbalances propitiously and to help <b>staighten</b> a defective posture. The theoretical part of this work explains the organization and the tasks of health physical education, man's locomotive system, the identification of the postural defects and their correction...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this article is devoted to the study {{families}} of totally real intersecting n-submanifolds of (C^n, 0). We give some conditions which allow to straighten holomorphically the family. If this is not possible to do it formally, we construct a germ of complex analytic set at the origin which interesection with the family can be holomorphically <b>staightened.</b> The second part is devoted to the study real analytic (n+r) -submanifolds of (C^n, 0) having a CR-singularity at the origin (r is a nonnegative integer). We consider deformations of quadrics and we define generalized Bishop invariants. Such a quadric intersects the complex linear manifold z_p+ 1 = [...] . =z_n= 0 along some real linear set L. We study what happens to this intersection when the quadric is analytically perturbed. On the other hand, we show, under some assumptions, that if such a submanifold is formally equivalent to its associated quadric then it is holomorphically equivalent to it. All these results rely on a result stating the existence (and caracterization) of a germ of complex analytic set left invariant by an abelian group of germs of holomorphic diffeomorphisms (not tangent to the identity at the origin).
