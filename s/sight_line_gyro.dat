40|$|Observations {{obtained}} with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) {{have been used}} to determine the column densities of D I, O I, and N I along seven <b>sight</b> <b>lines</b> that probe the local interstellar medium (LISM) at distances from 37 pc to 179 pc. Five of the <b>sight</b> <b>lines</b> are within the Local Bubble and two penetrate the surrounding H I wall. Reliable values of N(H I) were determined for five of the <b>sight</b> <b>lines</b> from HST data, IUE data, and published EUVE measurements. The weighted mean of D I/H I for these five <b>sight</b> <b>lines</b> is (1. 52 +/- 0. 08) x 10 - 5 (1 sigma uncertainty in the mean). It is likely that the D I/H I ratio in the Local Bubble has a single value. The D I/O I ratio for the five <b>sight</b> <b>lines</b> within the Local Bubble is (3. 76 +/- 0. 20) x 10 - 2. It is likely that the O I column densities can serve as a proxy for H I in the Local Bubble. The weighted mean for O I/H I for the seven FUSE <b>sight</b> <b>lines</b> is (3. 03 +/- 0. 21) x 10 - 4, comparable to the weighted mean (3. 43 +/- 0. 15) x 10 - 4 reported for 13 <b>sight</b> <b>lines</b> probing larger distances and higher column densities (Meyer et al. 1998, Meyer 2001). The FUSE weighted mean of N I/H I for the five <b>sight</b> <b>lines</b> is half that reported by Meyer et al. (1997) for seven <b>sight</b> <b>lines</b> with larger distances and higher column densities. This result combined with the variability of O I/N I (six <b>sight</b> <b>lines)</b> indicates that at the low column densities found in the LISM, nitrogen ionization balance is important. Thus, unlike O I, N I cannot be used as a proxy for H I or as a metallicity indicator in the LISM.

We find that extrapolation of the Fitzpatrick & Massa relationship from the ultraviolet appears to be a good predictor of the FUV extinction behavior. We find that predictions of the FUV extinction based upon the Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis (CCM) dependence on R_V give mixed results.

As a result, the cosmic-ray ionization rate inferred in similar environments (e. g. in several diffuse clouds) should also be relatively constant.

In contrast, only a small precentage of the Na I column density occurs at these velocites.

A two component model of the Ca II column density per unit velocity over the range l = 325 deg to 360 deg indicates that two distinct distributions exists, one with sigma = 8 km/s and one with sigma = 21 km/s. As much as 60 % of the Ca II column density at forbidden velocities may be associated with the faster distribution, which we attribute to warm intercloud material.

We supplement these with results from 4 regions distinguished by their IR through UV extinction curves and grouped as LMCAvg, LMC 2, SMC bar and SMC wing. Despite the distinct characters of Milky Way and Magellanic Cloud extinction, our results are generally analogous to those found for Galactic curves in that the FUSE portions of each extinction curve are described reasonably well by FM curves fitted only to longer wavelength data and lack any dramatic new extinction features, and any deviations from the CCM formalism continue into FUV wavelengths.
