The temperature of testes in the scrotum {{is at least}} a couple of degrees cooler than in the abdomen. Animal experiments in the middle of the 20th century suggested that raising the temperature could damage fertility. Some circumstantial evidence suggests tight underwear and other practices that raise the testicular temperature for prolonged periods can be associated with lower sperm counts. Nevertheless, research in recent decades suggests that the issue of fertility is more complex than a <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> temperature. It seems likely that subtle or transient hormone deficiencies or other factors that lead to a lack of descent also impair the development of spermatogenic tissue.|$|E

40|$|Language {{planning}} as {{a social}} scientific enterprise is roughly three decades old. It arose {{as an extension of}} sociolinguistics into the domain of social planning, and the job of describing and tracing patterns of language change thereby was tied to the normative task of prescribing such change. The enabling historical conditions which led to the formalization of language planning had their bases in postwar concerns with the systematic 'scientific' engineering of social and educational policy. As a result, many language planners embrace the discursive strategies of what Habermas (11972) has called 'technicist rationality': the presupposition that the linear application of positivist social science could transform problematic, value-laden cultural questions into <b>simple</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> technical efficiency...|$|R
25|$|Both pro- and anti-whaling {{countries}} {{claim that}} their recruiting activities {{are restricted to}} lobbying and persuasion based {{on the merits of}} their cause. Anti-whaling campaigners argue that scientific studies are not currently clear enough to warrant resumption of commercial whaling. Moreover, there are various other issues such as welfare of whales which is beyond the <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> conservation. (See The arguments for and against whaling) These issues have global relevance which is not restricted only to whaling and whaling countries. Moreover, public opinion in many anti-whaling countries is solidly behind the governmental position on whaling within the IWC. Pro-whaling countries, on the other hand, argue that the public's anti-whaling stance is often based on misinformation – a 2003 article in The Economist noted that surveys in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States had found that a majority of respondents incorrectly believe that all whale species are endangered.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{advance in}} analog computing was {{the development of}} the first fire-control systems for long range ship gunlaying. When gunnery ranges increased dramatically in the late 19th century it was no longer a <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> calculating the proper aim point, given the flight times of the shells. Various spotters on board the ship would relay distance measures and observations to a central plotting station. There the fire direction teams fed in the location, speed and direction of the ship and its target, as well as various adjustments for Coriolis effect, weather effects on the air, and other adjustments; the computer would then output a firing solution, which would be fed to the turrets for laying. In 1912, British engineer Arthur Pollen developed the first electrically powered mechanical analogue computer (called at the time the Argo Clock). It was used by the Imperial Russian Navy in World War I. The alternative Dreyer Table fire control system was fitted to British capital ships by mid-1916.|$|E

40|$|Following the Euro {{changeover}} in January 2002, consumers {{across the}} Euro Area perceived a {{sharp rise in}} inflation, in contrast to official figures. Several theories have been advanced to explain this apparent economic illusion, but they struggle to account for its striking scale and persistence. We offer an alternative account, {{based on the premise}} that the currency changeover increased consumers' perceptual error when assessing the value of monetary amounts. Under plausible assumptions, this would lead them to experience a loss of purchasing power. We confirm two empirical hypotheses in support of the theory: (1) the extent of overestimation of inflation was strongly associated with subjective difficulty using the Euro; (2) there was a simultaneous downward shift in expected inflation. Our results imply that currency changeovers are not <b>simple</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> numerical conversion. consumer behaviour/Euro changeover/inflation expectations/inflation perceptions/uncertainty...|$|R
