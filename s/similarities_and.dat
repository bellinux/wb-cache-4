5|$|As {{each region}} {{has its own}} {{traditional}} pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik Solo, batik Pekalongan, and batik Madura. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into batik pedalaman (inland batik) or batik pesisir (coastal batik). Batiks which do not fall neatly {{into one of these}} two categories are only referred to by their region. A mapping of batik designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs.|$|E
40|$|<b>Similarity</b> <b>and</b> dissimilarity {{are rarely}} formalized {{concepts}} in Artificial Intelligence (AI). <b>Similarity</b> <b>and</b> dissimilarity have a psychological origin, {{and they have}} been adapted to AI.

Extracting program features, processing those features into suitable representations, and constructing distance metrics to define <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> dissimilarity are the key methods to identify software variants, clones, derivatives, and classes of software. Software <b>Similarity</b> <b>and</b> Classification reviews the literature of those core concepts, in addition to relevant literature in each application and demonstrates that considering these applied problems as a <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> classification problem enables techniques to be shared between areas. Additionally, the authors present in-depth case studies using the software <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> classification techniques developed throughout the book...|$|R

Among the Naruto reader base, Gaara has been popular, placing high in several popularity polls and always making it to the top ten characters. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released in Gaara's likeness, including plush dolls, key chains, and action figures.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are thought}} to have relictual distributions, that is, their ancestors originally occupied marine habitats, but were then displaced from these habitats by modern dolphin lineages. Many of the morphological <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> adaptations to freshwater habitats arose due to convergent evolution; thus, a grouping of all river dolphins is paraphyletic. Amazon river dolphins are actually more closely related to oceanic dolphins than to South Asian river dolphins. Isthminia panamensis is an extinct genus and species of river dolphin, living 5.8 to 6.1 million years ago. Its fossils were discovered near Piña, Panama.|$|E
30|$|When {{it comes}} to {{examining}} heterogeneity <b>and</b> <b>similarity</b> attributes {{from the perspective of}} alternatives, we need to consider whether alternatives share IIA property.

5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> differences between the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that {{this might have been}} a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|India Knight, {{a novelist}} and {{columnist}} for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 {{that she had}} been reading The Cuckoo's Calling and thought it was good for a début novel. In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that the author was Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply. Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation. After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for linguistic analysis which found <b>similarities,</b> <b>and</b> subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym. Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%, and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand. , a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (£2,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (£3,950).|$|E
40|$|Semantic <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> {{relatedness}} measures {{assess how}} alike two words are within a language and are playing {{an important role}} in the development of the Semantic Web. This thesis research advances the knowledge of existing <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> relatedness measures. A generalized tool to experiment with semantic <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> relatedness measures in a variety of ontological terminologies has been developed using the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), a proposed W 3 C standard for the Semantic Web. SKOS represents a terminology or domain vocabulary in a machine-understandable way. A flexible conversion tool is used to convert any vocabulary in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus and OWL ontologies into an extended SKOS ontological terminology. The generalized tool for measuring semantic <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> relatedness is then used to analyze a wide variety of semantic <b>similarity</b> measures <b>and</b> new set-based relatedness measures on three major vocabularies of the UML...|$|R

5|$|Remains {{of prehistoric}} horses {{have been found}} in the Poitou region, with Mesolithic remains (20,000 to 5,000 BC) located near Surgères and Échiré. Some enthusiasts claim that the Poitevin horse is descended {{directly}} from these horses, based on physical <b>similarities,</b> <b>and</b> claim a common origin with the Tarpan horse painted on the Lascaux cave walls. However, this has not been confirmed by scientific studies, and numerous claims by other horse breeds of this same relationship have been invalidated by further research. Other horses were probably brought to the area by migrating Celts, and there is a record from the 10th century of a bishop from Rome asking the Count of Poitou for a mare from the region. These horses, like mules, were a favorite among the magistrates and ecclesiastical personnel in the medieval era, and were sold around Niort, Saint-Maixent, Auvergne, Dauphiné, Languedoc and in Spain. The number of horses in the area, however, was not well known before the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The most manifestly {{cyclical}} work of {{the three}} sonatas is the Sonata in A major. In the sonata's scherzo, a joyous passage in C major is suddenly interrupted by a fierce downward rushing scale in C-sharp minor, which closely recalls a parallel passage at {{the climax of the}} preceding movement; this is followed in the scherzo by a dance theme whose melody is derived from the Andantino's opening melody. This unique moment {{is one of the most}} explicit, audible cyclic references in the sonata trilogy. Another important cyclic element in the A major Sonata is the subtle <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> connections that exist between each movement's ending and the following movement's opening; the connection between the opening and ending of the sonata as a whole, is even bolder: the sonata ends in a cancrizans of its opening, a framing device which is probably unprecedented in the sonata literature.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in the Introduction section, the techniques for comparing conferences induce clusters of similar conferences, when applied to a conference catalog.

40|$|Dissociations between <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> {{categorization}} have constituted critical counter-evidence to {{the view}} that categorization is similarity-based. However, there have been difficulties in replicating such dissociations. This paper reports three experiments. The first provides evidence of a double dissociation between <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> categorization. The second and third show that by asking participants to make their judgments from particular perspectives, this dissociation disappears or is much reduced. It is argued that these data support a perspectival view of concepts, in which categorization is similarity-based, but where the dimensions used to make <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> categorization judgments are partially fixed by perspective...|$|R
