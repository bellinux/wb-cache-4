40|$|Purpose – Building on {{the risk}} {{balancing}} theory and on recent discussions {{the appropriateness of}} using farm income maximization as behavioural assumption, this paper extends the risk balancing framework by accounting for business-household interactions. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to theoretically introduce the concept of farm household risk balancing, a theoretical framework in which the farm household <b>sets</b> <b>a</b> <b>constraint</b> on the total household-level risk and balances farm-level and off-farm-level risk. Design/methodology/approach – The paper argues that the risk behaviour of farmers is better understood by considering risk at the household level. Using an analytical framework, equations are derived linking the farm activities, off-farm activities, consumption and business and private liquidity. Findings – The framework shows that a farm household that wants to minimize the risk that total household cash flow falls below consumption needs, may exhibit a wide variety of behavioural responses to changes in the policy and economic environment. Social implications – The framework suggests multiple ways for policy makers and individual farmers to support risk management. Originality/value – Risk management is at the core of the agricultural policy and it is of paramount importance to be able to understand behavioural responses to market and policy instruments. This paper contributes to that by suggesting that the focus of current risk analysis and management studies may be too narrowly focused at the farm level...|$|E

We derive a non-perturbative mean eld theory for the dynamics of minimum enstrophy relaxation by constructing an expression for PV flux during the relaxation process. The theory is used to elucidate the structure of anisotropic ows emerging from the selective decay process. This structural analysis of PV flux {{is based on the}} requirements that the mean flux of PV dissipates total potential enstrophy but conserves total fluid kinetic energy. Our results show that the structure of PV flux has the form of a sum of a positive de nite hyperviscous and a negative or positive viscous transport of PV. Transport parameters depend on zonal flow and turbulence intensity. Turbulence spreading is shown to be related to PV mixing via the link of turbulence energy flux to PV flux. In the relaxed state, the ratio of the PV gradient to zonal flow velocity is homogenized. This homogenized quantity <b>sets</b> <b>a</b> <b>constraint</b> on the amplitudes of PV and zonal ow in the relaxed state.

40|$|Masses {{of galaxy}} {{clusters}} and the cluster mass function (abundance of clusters {{as a function}} of cluster masses), have been estimated from the largest cluster catalog of SDSS galaxies using mainly three different interloper removal methods: the maximum velocity approach, the 2 - 3 sigma-clipping approach and the maximum velocity gap approach. In these three approaches the virial mass estimator have been used. The maximum velocity approach sets a criteria on the circular velocity and the infalling velocity for every galaxy in a certain distance to the cluster center. The 2 - 3 sigma-clipping approach cuts off interlopers by using the standard deviation on the velocities of the galaxies. Finally, the maximum velocity gap approach <b>sets</b> <b>a</b> <b>constraint</b> on the absolute velocity difference between neighboring galaxies. A set of 200 clusters provided by Wang et al. (2012) has been simulated on. The maximum velocity approach with a velocity constraint of 3000 km/s agrees best with the mass function derived analytically in Klypin et al. (2011). When using Hubble’s law, this constraint yields to a maximum cluster radii of around 40 Mpc (in the same range as the superclusters). The 2 sigma-clipping approach also agrees well with the mass function in Klypin et al. (2011). However it is clear that when there is an excess of interlopers or too few member galaxies in the cluster, all three methods give a larger uncertainty and become less qualitative.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the SIS 18 upgrade several measurement campaigns on the closed orbit (CO) and its correction were carried out in February-May 2006. The CO correction is important for machine operation: the better the CO is corrected, the fewer beam loss occurs during operation due to increase of the machine’s acceptance. CO errors are also relevant for feed down effects of multipoles, which may excite dangerous resonances [1]. In the SIS 18 24 analog beam position monitors (BPMs), 12 in each plane, are used for the CO diagnostics [2]. For the CO control and correction 6 horizontal and 12 vertical steerers are available. The CO was monitored with the POSI program [3]. The horizontal and vertical CO was corrected using a threesteerer local bump method [4]. Taking any three steering magnets with corresponding bump angles (θ 1, θ 2, θ 3) the condition of the local bump leaves unchanged the orbit at steerers 1 and 3 so that the CO outside of the steerer region 1 - 3 remains unchanged. This requirement <b>sets</b> <b>a</b> <b>constraint</b> between the angles (θ 1, θ 2, θ 3) according to β 1 θ 2 = −θ 1 β 2 β 1 θ 3 = θ 1 β 3 sin ψ 31 sin ψ 32 sin ψ 21 sin ψ 32 where θ 1 is an arbitrary angle, βi is the β-function at the ith steering magnet, ψij = ψi − ψj is the phase advance from the ith to the j th steering dipole. It is not necessary that all three steerers are located in neighbouring periods. Due to the SIS 18 symmetry in location of steerers in every period, the bump angles are dependent only on the phase advance between the steering dipoles, which could be written as ψij =(j − i) Δψ, where Δψ = 2 πQ/N, N = 12 is the number of periods, and Q is the horizontal/vertical tune. For three neighbouring steerers symmetrically located, the local bump condition (1) becomes θ 2 = − 2 θ 1 cos Δψ θ 3 = θ 1 where θ 1 is an arbitrary angle. Therefore for applying Eq. 2 no optical functions are needed: only the phase advance between steering dipoles Δψ. The method used is the following: the uncorrected CO shift x 0 in one BPM located between steerers 1 and 3 is measured with the POSI. By varying θ 1 and applying (θ 1, θ 2, θ 3) obtained from Eq. 2 we estimate ∂x 0 /∂θ 1. As the dynamics is linear, the CO at the BPM location is related to θ 1 vi...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the {{general theory of}} anisotropic flow formation in quasi two- dimensional turbulence from the perspective on the potential vorticity (PV) transport in real space. The aim is to calculate the vorticity or PV flux. In Chapter 2, the general structure of PV flux is deduced non-perturbatively using two relaxation models : the first is a mean field theory for the dynamics of minimum enstrophy relaxation based on the requirement that the mean flux of PV dissipates total potential enstrophy but conserves total fluid kinetic energy. The analyses show that the structure of PV flux has the form of a sum of a positive definite hyper-viscous and a negative or positive viscous flux of PV. Turbulence spreading is shown to be related to PV mixing via the link of turbulence energy flux to PV flux. In the relaxed state, the ratio of the PV gradient to zonal flow velocity is homogenized. This structure of the relaxed state is consistent with PV staircases. The homogenized quantity <b>sets</b> <b>a</b> <b>constraint</b> on the amplitudes of PV and zonal flow in the relaxed state. The second relaxation model is derived from a joint reflection symmetry principle, which constrains the PV flux driven by the deviation from the self- organized state. The form of PV flux contains a nonlinear convective term in addition to viscous and hyper-viscous terms. The nonlinear convective term, how- ever, {{can be viewed as a}} generalized diffusion, on account of the gradient- dependent ballistic transport in avalanche-like systems. For both cases, the detailed transport coefficients can be calculated using perturbation theory in Chapter 3. For a broad turbulence spectrum, a modulational calculation of the PV flux gives both a negative viscosity and a positive hyper-viscosity. For a narrow turbulence spectrum, the result of a parametric instability analysis shows that PV transport is also convective. In both relaxation and perturbative analyses, it is shown that turbulent PV transport is sensitive to flow structure, and the transport coefficients are nonlinear functions of flow shear. In Chapter 4, the effect of mean shear flows on zonal flow formation is considered in the contexts of plasma drift wave turbulence and quasi-geostrophic turbulence models. The generation of zonal flows by modulational instability in the presence of large-scale mean shear flows is studied using the method of characteristics as applied to the wave kinetic equation. It is shown that mean shear flows reduce the modulational instability growth rate by shortening the coherency time of the wave spectrum with the zonal shear. The scalings of zonal flow growth rate and turbulent vorticity flux with mean shear are determined in the strong shear limi...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, risk {{analysis}} and risk management {{have come to}} the fore of agricultural research and driven policy discussions regarding European agriculture. Indeed, numerous changes in the agricultural production chain such as increased globalization and liberalization, climatic changes and a growing awareness for environmental and animal welfare have made several types of risk increasingly important. A good understanding of farmers’ risk behavior is essential {{in order to be able}} to predict sectorial responses to these changes in risk conditions and to anticipate the outcome of risk-related policies. Risk balancing behavior constitutes one potential unanticipated risk response as it involves making strategic financial risk adjustments in response to changes in business risk levels. European evidence on risk balancing behavior, however, was lacking to date leaving EU-policy makers partly in the dark with regards to the full impact of risk-altering policy measures of the CAP—i. e., the existing decoupled income support and future risk management instruments currently considered in CAP reform discussions. Another area that is gaining increased attention in European agricultural {{risk analysis}} is the importance of farm household risk exposure and management. Given that farmers have a broad range of family-related goals and values and that EU farm households increasingly earn a large part of their household income from non-agricultural sources, agricultural risk behavior could be better understood by also considering risk exposure and risk constraints at the household level. Therefore, the possibility of the simultaneous adoption and potential correlation between different on-farm and off-farm responses needs to be acknowledged when looking at risk balancing behavior. The central research objective of this PhD dissertation is therefore to examine risk balancing behavior in European agriculture and acknowledging the role of the farm household. Chapter 2 presents a literature review that frames risk balancing research in the agricultural finance and decision making under risk literature and theoretically describes risk balancing behavior and the associated behavioral assumptions. Chapter 3 presents the first European evidence on risk balancing behavior using the rich EU- 15 FADN dataset for the period 1995 – 2008. By means of a correlation relationship analysis and several fixed effects regressions, the results reject evidence of strong-form risk balancing (trade-offs between financial risk and business risk keeping total risk constant) but cannot reject weak-form risk balancing (trade-offs between financial risk and business risk with some observed changes in total risk). While previous empirical studies focused on one production typology within one country, the results in this chapter disclose inter-country and inter-typology differences in risk balancing behavior. Using the Flanders (Belgium) FADN dataset for the period 2005 – 2012 complemented with survey data from 2013, it is further found that the observed risk balancing behavior might be driven by the risk averse proportion of farm operators. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to empirically validate that risk aversion is a prerequisite for risk balancing behavior. Chapter 4 discusses farm-level risk balancing measurement issues in greater detail and provides a deeper insight into the risk balancing behavior observed in Chapter 3. Risk balancing, in fact, involves two distinct risk responses depending on the direction of the strategic financial adjustment. When a farmer lowers financial risk in response to an increase in business risk, risk balancing entails a risk management strategy. Conversely, risk balancing behavior also involves an unanticipated entrepreneurship strategy where a farmer increases financial risk in response to lowered business risk conditions. To the best of my knowledge, this dissertation is the first study to explicitly consider both strategies and to empirically validate the occurrence of either strategy. Making use of correlation coefficients in the same EU- 15 FADN dataset from Chapter 3, risk balancing is mostly observed as a risk coping strategy for farmers (42 %) and to a lesser extent as an unanticipated risk response (26 %). In the latter case, I observed rather low incidence figures for the paradoxical situation where the financial risk response is greater than the business risk decline (dubbed ‘the paradox of risk balancing’ in literature) : only for 47 % of the entrepreneurship risk balancers (12 % of all risk balancers). By means of a multinomial Probit model, I further find that the determinants of a farmer’s choice to adopt either of both risk balancing strategies had opposite effects. These results clearly put risk balancing into a broader perspective and contrast the focus that is put on entrepreneurship risk balancing in literature. Chapter 5 of this dissertation theoretically extends the original Gabriel and Baker (1980) risk balancing framework to the household level. The novel concept of farm household risk balancing is introduced by means of a theoretical framework in which the farm household <b>sets</b> <b>a</b> <b>constraint</b> on the total household level risk and balances farm level and off-farm level risk. By taking farm household income and not just farm income as the focal point of the behavioral assumptions, a much wider variety of behavioral responses are considered in reaction to changes in the economic and policy environment. Besides altering the level of financial risk, farm households could just as well (i) attract off-farm income, (ii) smooth consumption levels, (iii) make off-farm investments or (iv) maintain liquidity buffers in response to exogenous changes in the level of business risk. Extensive empirical evidence from literature leading up to the model is presented and the implications for EU policy are discussed. Chapter 6 presents empirical evidence on Chapter 5 ’s novel household risk balancing framework using two distinct empirical approaches. First, based on 2013 survey information that complements the Flemish 2005 – 2012 FADN dataset, a psychometric household risk balancing scale is constructed. The results suggest that the average Flemish farm household exhibits household risk balancing behavior based on four underlying factors: (i) making decisions by the family as a whole, (ii) cutting private consumption in response to setbacks in business performance, (iii) mixing personal and business bank accounts to cover expenses and (iv) the necessity of off-farm income. Second, a system of equations was econometrically estimated using the Swiss 2003 – 2012 FADN dataset analyzing a farm household’s joint decision of the level of debt, off-farm income and consumption. The evidence supports the notion that farm households make strategic farm and off-farm decisions in response to exogenous changes in expected business risk. Both approaches demonstrate that part of the behavioral risk response of farm households is ignored when focusing solely on the farm-level in the original risk balancing framework and thus illustrate the relevance of the extended household risk balancing framework from Chapter 5. In summary, the findings of this dissertation provide a broader picture of risk balancing behavior in European agriculture. As the results reject evidence of strong-form risk balancing but cannot reject weak-form risk balancing, the balancing effect might not be as strong as the theoretical risk balancing models put forward. The extent of the balancing effect is further found to differ between countries and typologies and risk aversion is empirically validated as a necessary prerequisite for risk balancing behavior. Focusing on the direction of the balancing behavior, it is mostly observed as a risk coping strategy (risk management risk balancing) for farmers and to a lesser extent as an unanticipated risk response (entrepreneurship risk balancing). Accordingly, rather low incidence figures for the ‘Paradox of risk balancing’ are observed, which contrasts the focus that is put on this unanticipated behavioral response in the risk balancing literature. By extending the original risk balancing framework to the household level, this dissertation considers a much wider variety of behavioral responses in reaction to risk changes in the economic and policy environment. The empirical results suggest the incidence of household risk balancing behavior in two case study regions (Flanders and Switzerland). nrpages: 164 status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) is an {{extension}} of shortest path algorithms. The path computed using CSPF is a shortest path fulfilling <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of <b>constraints.</b> It simply means that it runs shortest path algorithm after pruning those links that violate <b>a</b> given <b>set</b> of <b>constraints.</b> <b>A</b> <b>constraint</b> could be minimum bandwidth required per link (also known as bandwidth guaranteed constraint), end-to-end delay, maximum number of links traversed, include/exclude nodes. CSPF is widely used in MPLS Traffic Engineering. The routing using CSPF is known as Constraint Based Routing (CBR).|$|R
