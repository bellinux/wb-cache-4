5|$|In aikido, as in {{virtually}} all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques.

The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.|$|E

The HV and HVO component of the offensive, codenamed Operation Maestral 2, was launched on 8 September {{with the aim of}} capturing the towns of Jajce, Šipovo and Drvar, while the ARBiH 7th Corps advanced on the right flank of the HV and the HVO towards Donji Vakuf.

5|$|Before {{construction}} could begin, the Navy {{found itself}} {{in the midst of}} political situation because the Hungarian government demanded that a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> of the submarine contracts be allocated to Hungarian firms. After intricate negotiations, the order was split into two orders of two submarines each, with U-20 and U-21 built at the Pola Navy Yard, and U-22 and U-23 built at the Hungarian UBAG yard at Fiume. The subcontracts were also divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, with about two-thirds going to Hungarian companies and one-third to Austrian companies. This allocation of contracts, while politically expedient, exacerbated technical problems that resulted in numerous modifications and delays.|$|E

Rixey originally declined, saying he wanted to be a chemist, but Rigler insisted, even offering a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> of the bonus he received for signing a player. With his family in financial trouble, Rixey accepted the deal. The National League, upon hearing of the deal, created a rule that prohibits umpires from signing players.

Lake Scranton and the Williams Bridge Reservoir are used as a water supply, with the former providing 22 million gallons of water per day. Together with Roaring Brook and Spring Brook, it provides a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> of the water supply of the Lackawanna Valley.

5|$|Under the {{protection}} of the National Guard, some miners returned to work and some strikebreakers, imported from the eastern coalfields, joined them as Guard troops protecting their movements. In February 1914, a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> of the troops were withdrawn, but a large contingent remained at Ludlow. On April 20, 1914, a general fire-fight occurred between strikers and troops, which was antagonized by the troops and mine guards. The camp was burned, resulting in 15 women and children, who hid in tents at the camp, being burned to death. Costs to both mine operators and the union were high. This incident brought unwanted national attention to Colorado.|$|E
5|$|Donaggio had no {{interest}} in making soundtracks for films at the time, but was introduced to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out and asked him to write something for the beginning of the film. Roeg was enthusiastic about the result but the London-based producers were resistant to hiring someone who had no background in films. The film's financiers were pleased with Donaggio's work and overruled the producers. As well as composing the score, Donaggio performed a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> of it himself. The piano pieces were performed by Donaggio, {{despite the fact that he}} was not very accomplished at playing the piano. The piano pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film, and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play the piano. Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at playing the piano, the pieces had an unsure style to them, perfect for the effect they were trying to capture.|$|E

5|$|In 1912 John Fluor {{moved to}} Santa Ana, California {{for health reasons}} without his {{brothers}} and founded Fluor Corporation out of his garage under the name Fluor Construction Company. By 1924 the business had annual revenues of $100,000 ($1.36 million in 2013 dollars) and a staff of 100 employees. John Fluor delegated most of the company's operations to his sons, Peter and Simon Fluor. A $100,000 capital investment was made that year and it was incorporated. John's eldest son Peter served as head of sales and grew the company to $1.5 million ($20.4 million in 2013 dollars) in revenues by 1929. In 1929 the company re-incorporated as Fluor Corporation. By the 1930s, Fluor had operations in Europe, the Middle East and Australia. Business declined rapidly during the Great Depression, but picked up again during World War II. During the war Fluor manufactured synthetic rubber and was responsible for a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> of high-octane gasoline production in the United States. A Gas-Gasoline division of Fluor was created in Houston in 1948.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Credit Suisse began {{catering}} to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts. The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel. The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts. During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts. After World War II, a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts. Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates. This {{led to a}} class action lawsuit in 1996 that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion.

The film also features three voice actors for Ratchet in the Ratchet & Clank series, Mikey Kelley and Kevin Michael Richardson from the first game, and James Arnold Taylor from the others, playing Michelangelo and Leonardo respectively. TMNT would be Mako Iwamatsu's final acting role. Mako was announced {{as the voice of}} Splinter at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 20, 2006. He then died the next day, aged 72. A dedication to Mako appears {{at the end of the}} film's credits. Although Iwamatsu is the only actor credited in the role, Greg Baldwin performs a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> of Splinter's dialogue in the finished film; Baldwin had already mimicked Iwamatsu's voice when he took up the late actor's role as Iroh in the concurrently-produced cartoon , and used this precedent to successfully lobby to join the cast of TMNT as Splinter following Iwamatsu's death.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman Empire {{demanded a}} total {{liquidation}} of the Cossack power. The Commonwealth, however, needed the Cossacks in the south-east, where they provided an effective buffer against Crimean Tatars incursions. The {{other way to}} quell the Cossack unrest would be to grant the nobility status to a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> of their population and thus assimilate them into the Commonwealth's power structure, which was what Cossacks aspired to. This solution was being rejected by the magnates and szlachta for political, economic and cultural reasons when there was still time for reform, before disasters struck. The Polish–Lithuanian establishment had instead shifted unsteadily between compromising with the Cossacks, allowing limited varying numbers, the so-called Cossack register (500 in 1582, 8000 in the 1630s), to serve with the Commonwealth army (the rest were to be converted into serfdom, to help the magnates in colonizing the Dnieper area), and brutally using military force {{in an attempt to}} subdue them.|$|E
5|$|The {{local board}} was reconstituted as an urban {{district}} council in the administrative county of Cheshire under the Local Government Act 1894. Altrincham Urban District was expanded in 1920 when parts of Carrington and Dunham Massey Civil Parishes were added.

At the same time, there was a minor exchange of areas with Hale Urban District; a minor addition from Bowdon Urban District; and a further <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> of Dunham Massey Civil Parish was added. In 1937 the urban district was granted a charter of incorporation and became a municipal borough. The new borough was granted armorial bearings which featured heraldic references to the Masseys and Earls of Stamford. With the passage of the Local Government Act 1972, the administrative counties and municipal boroughs were abolished and Altrincham became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester on 1 April 1974.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Emma was a weak but {{unusually large}} {{tropical}} cyclone that affected a <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> of Western Australia during the 2005–06 Australian region cyclone season. Forming {{out of an}} {{area of low pressure}} on 25 February, the precursor to Emma slowly tracked southward. Although classified tropical, the structure of the system represented that of a monsoonal storm. However, low wind shear and well-developed outflow gradually allowed convection to develop near the centre of circulation. As the system approached the Pilbara coastline of Western Australia on 27 February, it intensified into a Category 1 cyclone and attained peak 10-minute sustained winds of 75km/h (45mph). After moving inland near Mardie, Emma weakened to a tropical low but became exceedingly large; its cloud cover obscured most of Western Australia. The remnants of the weak storm persisted until 1 March, at which time they dissipated over the Great Australian Bight.|$|E
