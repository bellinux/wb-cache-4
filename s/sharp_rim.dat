25|$|Craters are {{ubiquitous}} {{features of}} the mercurian surface. For the purpose of mapping, a fivefold morphologic classification of craters (fig. 10 in McCauley et al., 1981) {{is the basis for}} determining their relative ages. The youngest craters (c5) have <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> crests, textured ejecta blankets, and a well-defined field of secondary craters. Under favourable lighting conditions, the youngest craters exhibit bright rays superposed on all older materials. Older craters have increasingly degraded rims and lower relief and have lost their secondary crater fields. The major differences between mercurian and lunar craters are apparently related to the greater gravitational acceleration and the higher impact velocities on Mercury. Continuous ejecta deposits are less extensive, and secondary craters are more sharply defined and clustered nearer their primary crater. Also on Mercury, accentuated secondary craters form prominent crater chains radial to large craters.|$|E
2500|$|Canaan Valley — {{like the}} very similar Burke's Garden in Virginia — is a {{southern}} [...] "muskeg" [...] occupying an anticline valley. The Valley itself is {{carved into the}} low dome of sedimentary rock known as the Blackwater Anticline, exposing the soft shales of the Mauch Chunk Formation. In the Canaan Valley region, the Blackwater River began carving into the underlying sedimentary rock layers of Mississippian and Pennsylvanian age (345–270 millions years ago) about one million years ago. The hard, erosion-resistant Pottsville Formation of sandstones is the higher layer supporting the mountains surrounding Canaan Valley and also constitutes the <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> of the nearby Blackwater Gorge. Tombstone-like outcroppings of Greenbrier Limestone are also exposed at places along the Valley floor. A relatively high area within the Valley – the Central Pocono Ridge – [...] is composed of the erosion-resistant Pocono Group sandstone.|$|E
6000|$|Donkin prowled spiteful {{and alone}} amongst the shadows, {{thinking}} that Jimmy too long delayed to die. That evening land {{had been reported}} from aloft, and the master, while adjusting the tubes of the long glass, had observed with quiet bitterness to Mr. Baker that, after fighting our way inch by inch to the Western Islands, {{there was nothing to}} expect now but a spell of calm. The sky was clear and the barometer high. The light breeze dropped with the sun, and an enormous stillness, forerunner of a night without wind, descended upon the heated waters of the ocean. As long as daylight lasted, the hands collected on the forecastle-head watched on the eastern sky the island of Flores, that rose above the level expanse of the sea with irregular and broken outlines like a sombre ruin upon a vast and deserted plain. It was the first land seen for nearly four months. Charley was excited, {{and in the midst of}} general indulgence took liberties with his betters. Men strangely elated without knowing why, talked in groups, and pointed with bared arms. For the first time that voyage Jimmy's sham existence seemed for a moment forgotten in the face of a solid reality. We had got so far anyhow. Belfast discoursed, quoting imaginary examples of short homeward runs from the Islands. [...] "Them smart fruit schooners do it in five days," [...] he affirmed. [...] "What do you want?--only a good little breeze." [...] Archie maintained that seven days was the record passage, and they disputed amicably with insulting words. Knowles declared he could already smell home from there, and with a heavy list on his short leg laughed fit to split his sides. A group of grizzled sea-dogs looked out for a time in silence and with grim absorbed faces. One said suddenly--"'Tain't far to London now."--"My first night ashore, blamme if I haven't steak and onions for supper... and a pint of bitter," [...] said another.--"A barrel ye mean," [...] shouted someone.--"Ham an' eggs three times a day. That's the way I live!" [...] cried an excited voice. There was a stir, appreciative murmurs; eyes began to shine; jaws champed; short, nervous laughs were heard. Archie smiled with reserve all to himself. Singleton came up, gave a careless glance, and went down again without saying a word, indifferent, like a man who had seen Flores an incalculable number of times. The night travelling from the East blotted out of the limpid sky the purple stain of the high land. [...] "Dead calm," [...] said somebody quietly. The murmur of lively talk suddenly wavered, died out; the clusters broke up; men began to drift away one by one, descending the ladders slowly and with serious faces as if sobered by that reminder of their dependence upon the invisible. And when the big yellow moon ascended gently above the <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> of the clear horizon it found the ship wrapped up in a breathless silence; a fearless ship that seemed to sleep profoundly, dreamlessly on the bosom of the sleeping and terrible sea.|$|E
50|$|Forbesiceras is an ammonite {{that lived}} during the Cenomanian {{stage of the}} Late Cretaceous. Shells are {{moderately}} large, reaching diameters of 33 cm (13 in)or so, forming smooth, involute oxycones with narrow or <b>sharp</b> <b>rims</b> and closed umbilici.|$|R
5000|$|Preparation of a proof {{striking}} usually involved polishing of the dies. They {{can usually}} be distinguished from normal circulation coins by their <b>sharper</b> <b>rims</b> and design, as well as much smoother [...] "fields" [...] - the blank areas {{not part of the}} coin's design.|$|R
50|$|Although many pottery {{pieces were}} found, {{they were only}} able to rebuild two pots. 78 stone vessels were recovered. There were several {{different}} types of bowls found, including platters and shallow basins, pestle-rubbing, deep bowls, round-and flat-based, convex-sided bowls with <b>sharp</b> <b>rims,</b> oblong and oval bowls. These patterns were more ornate than others in the region.|$|R

50|$|Galen is a {{circular}} crater with a bowl-shaped interior and a <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> {{that has not}} undergone significant erosion. The small interior floor has a lower albedo than the surrounding walls.|$|E
50|$|The term Salawaku means 'protection' and 'repellence': a {{reference}} to the supernatural protection of the ancestors; or 'to miss and to catch'. With this technique the defender catches his adversary's weapon, secures it in the wooden shield and then disarms him. The shield is not only a defensive weapon, but thanks to its peculiar, narrow shape may be easily moved to deliver blows with the <b>sharp</b> <b>rims</b> and corners.|$|R
50|$|The hill {{takes the}} form of a plateau with <b>sharp</b> <b>rims</b> on several sides. To the {{northeast}} is Craig Pwllfa overlooking Cwm Banw whilst Craig y Fan looks east over Cwm Tarthwynni. To the south is the edge known as Cwar y Gigfran which translates into English as 'quarry of the crow'. It marks the top of a large landslipped area extending to the stream of Blaen y Glyn below.|$|R
5000|$|Williston {{explains}} that the humerus and femur of Dissorophus are solidly built and stouter. The humerus has [...] "deep lateral curvatures and wide supracondicular ridges" [...] while the femur is a lot stronger built compared to the humerus. He also mentions that the articular surface of Dissorophus femur is [...] "flattened with <b>sharp</b> <b>rims</b> on the antero-posterior convexity". He adds that both femur and humerus are both [...] "expanded on {{the inner and outer}} side and narrow in the middle".|$|R
50|$|Due west of Catalán, the {{satellite}} craters Catalán A {{and the smaller}} Catalán B form a joined pair, with each having a <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> and a bowl-shaped interior. To the northwest of Catalán A is the nearly symmetrical, bowl-shaped Catalán U.|$|E
50|$|The player directs {{a stream}} of air over the <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> or {{on top of the}} pipe. It has a pentatonic scale, sol, la, do, re, mi, or do, re, mi, sol, la. Endere is tuned on the {{xylophone}} key since the xylophone is omnipresent throughout Uganda.|$|E
50|$|This is a bowl-shaped crater with a <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> and an {{interior}} floor {{about half the}} diameter of the crater. The crater is slightly long along a line to the northwest, where the inner wall is also at its widest. It is otherwise an undistinguished crater formation.|$|E
60|$|The {{next moment}} the lantern was flung up almost into his eyes, {{and in the}} light he saw the <b>sharp,</b> round <b>rim</b> of a pistol-barrel {{directed}} immediately against his forehead.|$|R
50|$|Balboa A is a well-formed {{impact crater}} located {{just to the}} {{southeast}} of Balboa, with a <b>sharp,</b> notched <b>rim</b> and an irregular interior. Its diameter is only somewhat smaller than Dalton directly to the west.|$|R
50|$|Krafft has a <b>sharp,</b> {{circular}} <b>rim</b> with a rampart on the exterior, and {{no central}} peak. There are several associated craters near the southern rim that are notable for their size {{in relation to}} the dimensions of Krafft.|$|R
50|$|This is a circular, bowl-shaped crater with a <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> {{that has}} not been {{significantly}} eroded. The interior walls slope down to the tiny floor at the midpoint. Just to the north of Franck is a joined pair of smaller craters, and the three nearly form a merged cluster of impacts.|$|E
5000|$|Hebetoxyites is {{a fossil}} ammonoid {{cephalopod}} {{from the middle}} part of the Bajocian stage, middle Jurassic, included in the Strigoceratidae, Haplocerataceae. The shell is oxyconic, with a <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> but no keel, and involute, with the inner whorls hidden. The unbilicus is very small. Sides have a spiral ridge but are not strigate.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{relatively}} young impact crater with well-defined features {{that have not been}} significantly eroded by subsequent impacts. The rim is circular but somewhat uneven along the edge, with outward protrusions along all sides except to the north and northwest. The inner wall has slumped in places, producing a <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> edge in the southern half. There are also a number of short terraces along the inner wall.|$|E
5000|$|Balticeras is an involute, {{discoidal}} Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian) ammonite (order Ammonitida) {{found in}} England, Germany, and Switzerland, {{belonging to the}} Perisphinctidae. The shell is strongly embracing, tending to be oxyconic (sharp rimmed). Sides are gently curved, converging on a narrow to <b>sharp</b> ventral <b>rim.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the crater}} {{formations}} associated with Poczobutt are almost as eroded as the main crater. However Poczobutt H, along the outer rim to the northeast, has a <b>sharp,</b> well-defined <b>rim,</b> some terraces along the inner wall, and a higher albedo compared to the surrounding terrain.|$|R
50|$|Tarpeia is {{a crater}} on the {{asteroid}} 4 Vesta located at 69.5°S and 29°E, within the ridged and grooved terrain of Vesta's southern hemisphere. It has {{a diameter of}} 41 km. It is irregularly shaped and has a <b>sharp,</b> fresh <b>rim.</b> It contains many small craters less than a kilometer across and its steep slopes shows brilliant layers of minerals.|$|R
50|$|This crater is {{a younger}} {{formation}} {{than the two}} craters it overlies, particularly the worn Huggins to the west. This crater retains much detail, including a terraced inner wall and a <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> {{to the south and}} east where the inner wall has slumped. The interior floor is relatively level, but rough-surfaced. There are a few low central peaks near the midpoint of the interior, and a few tiny craterlets to mark the surface.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{circular}} crater with a <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> (Rima Dawes) {{that has a}} slightly flattened oval perimeter. It has a slight central rise, and a somewhat darker floor that is nearly covered in overlapping swirl-like deposits. Much of the deposits are slumped or fall-back material. The inner walls are steep and free from impact erosion. It lies next to Catena Brigitte to the northeast. The rille name {{was approved by the}} IAU in 1985.|$|E
50|$|The wall of Menelaus is {{slightly}} irregular in outline, with a high, <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> and terraced inner walls. The interior {{has a high}} albedo that is prominent under high sun angles. There are several ridges on the floor. It also has a moderate ray system, with the most prominent ray aligned to the north-northeast across the Mare Serenitatis. The location of this ray and slightly off-center central peak suggest an impact at a relatively low angle.|$|E
50|$|This crater {{has only}} been {{slightly}} worn through impact erosion, and it retains a <b>sharp</b> outer <b>rim</b> and well-defined features. The loose material along the inner walls has slumped and accumulated at the bottom about the interior floor, particularly along the western half. The rim is roughly circular in shape, but has minor irregularities {{in the form of}} slight outward bulges in the perimeter.|$|R
5000|$|Most large impact craters do {{not have}} a central peak, yet have <b>sharp</b> <b>rims</b> bordered by {{asymmetrical}} radar bright ejecta blankets, have multiple rims, are surrounded and partially filled by subsequent lava which creates a reduced apparent depth, have dark crater floors, and buries some ejecta. By analyzing Magellan images, Cleopatra patera’s was found to be distorted in shape in that its noncircular inner ring is off center, but also that the outflow channel of lava moves from within the crater and reaches the top of the crater rim. The interiors are radar dark and smooth in comparison to the surrounding plains. [...] From the image of Plate P-11 from Venera 15 and 16 shows that Cleopatra patera that was originally interpreted as a large caldera but has now been interpreted as a multi-ringed impact crater with a central peak. Using photogeologic analysis, the floor of the crater has a shallow central depression resulting from subsidence of uplifted mantle material from below due to [...] "viscous relaxation". This was found in Venusian craters larger than 70 km in diameter by using altimetry data which shows surfaces with different elevations from the Magellan mission.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the map {{area are}} crater {{clusters}} and chains that are satellitic to both craters and basins, but the host crater {{may not be}} identifiable everywhere. This material is interpreted to be from secondary impact craters {{of a wide variety}} of ages. Many mercurian secondaries are well preserved and have <b>sharp,</b> unrounded <b>rims.</b> This morphology is probably a consequence of the stronger mercurian gravity, relative to the Moon, that produces higher impact velocities for crater ejecta on the mercurian surface (Scott, 1977).|$|R
50|$|It is a {{worn and}} eroded crater with a {{battered}} outer rim that is overlaid by several smaller craters. The rim is a circular range of rugged, irregular ground that is notched in places along the inner wall. A chain of small craters lies {{along the northern}} and northeastern rim. At the west end, a pair of clefts in the rim nearly join the floor to the surface beyond. To the northeast, Xenophanes A is an impact crater with a <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> and a rough interior.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{circular}} crater with an outer rim {{that has an}} uneven form due to multiple small outward bulges. The perimeter is only slightly worn, and retains a <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> that projects above the surroundings. Two notable craters {{are attached to the}} outer rim: Chaffee F to the west and Chaffee W along the northwest. Chaffee actually intrudes somewhat into the former crater, and the two share a common rim. There is also a tiny craterlet exactly on the rim to the south-southeast.|$|E
50|$|Another tool used to {{make these}} tests is the pocket {{hardness}} tester. This tool consists of a scale arm with graduated markings attached to a four-wheeled carriage. A scratch tool with a <b>sharp</b> <b>rim</b> is mounted at a predetermined angle to the testing surface. In order to use it a weight of known mass {{is added to the}} scale arm at one of the graduated markings, the tool is then drawn across the test surface. The use of the weight and markings allows a known pressure to be applied without the need for complicated machinery.|$|E
25|$|Mouthpiece {{selection}} {{is a highly}} personal decision. Thus, a symphonic trombonist might prefer a mouthpiece with a deeper cup and <b>sharper</b> inner <b>rim</b> shape {{in order to produce}} a rich symphonic tone quality, while a jazz trombonist might choose a shallower cup for brighter tone and easier production of higher notes. Further, for certain compositions, these choices between two such performers could easily be reversed. Some mouthpiece makers now offer mouthpieces that feature removable rims and cups allowing players to further customize and adjust their mouthpiece to their preference.|$|R
50|$|Hell is a lunar crater in {{the south}} of the Moon's near side, within the western half of the {{enormous}} walled plain Deslandres. To the southeast, also within Deslandres, is the larger crater Lexell, and about 9° to the south lies the prominent Tycho crater. The crater received its name in 1935 after the Hungarian astronomer and ordained Jesuit priest Maximilian Hell. It has 19 satellite craters with diameters ranging between about 3 and 22 km. Nearly all Hell craters are relatively flat and shallow, with a <b>sharp,</b> well-defined <b>rim</b> and a typical diameter-to-depth ratio of about 10.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{exceptional}} {{of the animals}} that move on steep or even near vertical rock faces by careful balancing and leaping are {{the various types of}} mountain dwelling caprid such as the Barbary sheep, markhor, yak, ibex, tahr, rocky mountain goat, and chamois. Their adaptations may include a soft rubbery pad between their hooves for grip, hooves with <b>sharp</b> keratin <b>rims</b> for lodging in small footholds, and prominent dew claws. The snow leopard, being a predator of such mountain caprids, also has spectacular balance and leaping abilities; being able to leap up to ≈17m (~50 ft). Other balancers and leapers include the mountain zebra, mountain tapir, and hyraxes.|$|R
