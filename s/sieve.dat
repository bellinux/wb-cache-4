Data <b>sieving</b> {{is an important}} technique to improve the performance of noncontiguous I/O accesses by combining small and noncontiguous requests into a large and contiguous request.

In this study, we propose a new data <b>sieving</b> approach namely Performance Model Directed Data <b>Sieving,</b> or PMD data <b>sieving</b> in short. It improves the existing data <b>sieving</b> approach from two aspects: 1) dynamically determines when it is beneficial to perform data sieving; and 2) dynamically determines how to perform data <b>sieving</b> if beneficial. It improves {{the performance of the}} existing data <b>sieving</b> approach and reduces the memory consumption as verified by experimental results. Given the importance of supporting noncontiguous accesses effectively and reducing the memory pressure in a large-scale system, the proposed PMD data <b>sieving</b> approach in this research holds a promise and {{will have an impact on}} high performance I/O systems.

5|$|Boogeyman 2 is a 2007 American supernatural horror film {{edited and}} {{directed}} by Jeff Betancourt and the sequel to the 2005 film Boogeyman. The film was written by Brian <b>Sieve</b> and stars Danielle Savre, Matt Cohen, Tobin Bell and Renee O'Connor. Savre portrays Laura Porter, a woman who witnessed her parents' murder alongside her brother as a child. She believes the killer to be the Boogeyman, and now as an adult seeks group therapy to overcome her phobia of the creature. However, her fears become reality as her fellow patients are murdered one by one.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{previous}} film's financial success, Boogeyman 2 was announced in October 2006. Production of the film began in the same month with the hiring of Betancourt as director and <b>Sieve</b> attached as writer. Casting began in December {{of the same year}} with the hiring of O'Connor; Savre got the lead role in January 2007. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the former hospital, Linda Vista Community Hospital, over a four-month period, beginning in January 2007 and concluding in April. Unlike the original film, which featured the Boogeyman as a supernatural entity, Betancourt strove to present a more grounded and realistic version of the mythical creature. Additionally, emphasis was placed on the writing and atmosphere to compensate for the film's small $4.5 million budget.|$|E
5|$|Systemin and AtPEP1 {{are found}} in the cell cytosol. The {{precursor}} to tomato systemin is transcribed as a 200 amino acid polypeptide. It does not contain a putative signal sequence suggesting that it is synthesised on free ribosomes in the cytosol. The precursor to AtPEP1 is a 92 amino acid polypeptide and also lacks a signal sequence. In tomato, mRNA encoding the precursor for systemin is present at very low levels in unwounded leaves but accumulates upon wounding, particularly in the cells surrounding the <b>sieve</b> elements of the phloem in vascular bundles of mid veins. The precursor accumulates exclusively in the phloem parenchyma cells of leaves in tomato after wounding. The precursor to potato systemin is also localised in a similar manner suggesting it is under the same cell-type-specific regulation in both species.|$|E

Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the sclerenchyma and xylem which are dead at maturity, and the phloem <b>sieve</b> tubes which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodelling, an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.|$|E
5|$|Boogeyman 2 {{was first}} {{announced}} in October 2006 {{due to the}} financial success of its predecessor with Jeff Betancourt, film editor of The Exorcism of Emily Rose, When a Stranger Calls and The Grudge 2, making his directorial debut and Brian <b>Sieve</b> attached as writer. The film was slated to start development in January 2007 in Los Angeles, California. It was produced by Ghost House Pictures, a film production company created by Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert which specializes in creating horror films. Betancourt stated {{that he wanted to}} avoid usage of CGI as well as present a new take on the Boogeyman rather than rehashing the storyline of the first film; this led to a more grounded version of the creature in the film. As a result, and due to the film's low budget, he focused especially on the atmosphere and writing. Storyboards were used extensively to plan out the film and minimize wasted effort and resources by make-up artists on unused prosthetics; the limited budget meant that most effects could only be filmed once. The former hospital Linda Vista Community Hospital served as the primary filming location for the mental institution.|$|E
5|$|Caprellamutica are {{omnivorous}} highly adaptable opportunistic feeders. Examinations {{of their}} stomach contents reveal a highly varied diet that {{depended on the}} particular substrate they are found on. They are predominantly detritivores, but have the remarkable ability of adjusting feeding methods from being grazers, scavengers, filter feeders, and even predators depending on the conditions of their environments. C.mutica <b>sieve</b> food particles or small organisms from the water by waving their bodies back and forth, with the comb-like setae on their second pair of antennae extended. They then clean off trapped particles by bending their antennae down to their mouthparts. They also use their antennae to scrape food particles from surfaces of their bodies or the substrate that they are clinging to. The large gnathopods are used for striking at and grasping both mobile and sessile prey. Known prey organisms of C.mutica include algae (both planktonic and macroalgae), dinoflagellates, hydrozoans, bryozoans, diatoms, copepods, brine shrimps, and other amphipods. They are capable of feeding on suspended organic particles, including fish feed and decaying organic matter. C.mutica are also known to engage in cannibalistic behavior on dead and dying individuals of their own species or genus.|$|E

5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a <b>sieve</b> to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E
5|$|However, {{contrary}} to {{the expectations of the}} Red Queen hypothesis, Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. Furthermore, Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in their host. At an even more fundamental level, Heng and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence that sex, rather than enhancing diversity, acts as a constraint on genetic diversity. They considered that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual <b>sieve.</b> The adaptive function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills. A principal alternative view to the Red Queen hypothesis is that sex arose, and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that genetic variation is produced as a byproduct.|$|E

The <b>sieving</b> {{characteristics of}} the prototype drugs gentamicin (poorly protein bound) and phenytoin (highly protein bound) were measured in vitro using polysulfone capillary hemofilters {{similar to those used}} in clinical continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration. Plasma water, whole plasma, and whole blood were the solvent systems used with variable drug concentrations and solvent flow rates. Our results indicate that the <b>sieving</b> coefficients for both drugs can be accurately defined as the concentration in the ultrafiltrate divided by the concentration in the artery. This correlates with a more rigorously derived expression by Colton and Henderson (r = 0. 98, P < 0. 00001 for both drugs) and avoids the necessity of measuring venous concentrations. Drug <b>sieving</b> in the three solvents followed expectations from known protein–binding data and was independent of solvent flow rate. For both drugs, at higher drug concentrations <b>sieving</b> increased in plasma, consistent with the saturation of protein–binding sites. In whole blood, <b>sieving</b> fell for both drugs with increasing drug concentrations, consistent with drug compartmentalization into red blood cells. Although these <b>sieving</b> changes with increasing drug concentrations were statistically significant, their clinical significance is doubtful.

Yet Chinese hempen paper of the Western Han and early Eastern Han eras was of a coarse quality and used primarily as wrapping paper. The papermaking process was not formally introduced until the Eastern Han court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121 CE) created a process in 105 CE where mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens, and fish nets were boiled together to make a pulp that was pounded, stirred in water, and then dunked with a wooden <b>sieve</b> containing a reed mat that was shaken, dried, and bleached into sheets of paper. The oldest known piece of paper with writing on it comes from the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, Inner Mongolia, dated precisely 110 CE when the Han garrison abandoned the area following a nomadic Xiongnu attack.
