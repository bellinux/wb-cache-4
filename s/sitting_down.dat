5|$|As {{with other}} ratites, emus have a {{relatively}} low basal metabolic rate compared to other types of birds. At , the metabolic rate of an emu <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> is about 60% of that when standing, partly because the lack of feathers under the stomach leads to {{a higher rate of}} heat loss when standing from the exposed underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Ganesha is {{a popular}} figure in Indian art. Unlike those of some deities, {{representations}} of Ganesha show wide variations and distinct patterns changing over time.

5|$|Once in the station, riders board a train <b>sitting</b> <b>down,</b> in {{a similar}} style to {{inverted}} roller coasters. Riders are restrained through a padded over-the-shoulder harness and a lap bar. At the ankles, two flaps hold the legs in position and close as the harness locks into place. After a train is fully locked and checked, riders are raised into the flying position and the train departs the station. Since being rethemed to Galactica for 2016, riders {{have the option of}} wearing virtual reality headsets, which are attached to the restraints.|$|E

5|$|As {{the taping}} time, 6 pm, is fast approaching, Tracy begins acting strangely. Liz and Pete {{discover}} {{that he has}} not been taking his medication correctly. Liz calls Tracy's doctor, Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell), who gives her instructions regarding the medication. Liz gives the instructions to Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who has to visit multiple identical pharmacies until he finds the correct one, which will have Tracy's new medication. Liz and Pete's attempts to get Tracy to the Late Night stage on time are further complicated as Jack persistently calls Liz to his office to ask for her advice on a speech he is going to read at The Waldorf Astoria. Tracy eventually appears on Late Night only to immediately fall asleep after <b>sitting</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} {{cinematic}} black bars expanding {{to reveal the}} scenery, which {{is set in a}} beach. Individual takes of the girls are shown momentarily as Dinah sings the chorus. The camera shifts to Fetty Wap, who is <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> in a chair with a guitar next to him. As he sings, the girls are seen dancing in the water, with Lauren kicking the water as the video goes into a slow-motion take for less than a second. Several of the scenes include Normani alone in a rock cliff, a close-up of Dinah singing and a shot of the girls together near the water.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E

5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E
5|$|Superman: Ultimate Flight is a steel flying {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} by Bolliger & Mabillard. Themed {{to the popular}} comic book character, Superman: Ultimate Flight has been installed at three Six Flags theme parks around the United States: Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Great Adventure and Six Flags Great America. The first of these was at Six Flags Over Georgia, which interacts with the terrain {{much more than the}} other two. Superman: Ultimate Flight simulates flying by positioning its passengers parallel to the track, supported by harnesses and facing the ground through most of the ride. In the station, riders board the train <b>sitting</b> <b>down.</b> After the train is locked and checked, the trains are raised into the flying position. After the ride, the seats are lowered back into the sitting position for the next round of riders.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with a {{scene of}} the band {{beginning}} to perform the song in a house's detached garage. When the first verse starts, Stefani's ex-lover (Terry Hall) walks by the house before <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> on a swing. Stefani changes her shoes as the song's chorus is played; she walks away from the garage and down a street to a grocery store. At the store, she purchases four cans of tomato sauce, and quickly leaves. Meanwhile, Dumont, Kanal, and Young prepare a large dinner for the band as Stefani reenters the home. Stefani slices tomatoes, Dumont cooks some spaghetti noodles, Kanal cuts up a few onions, and Young sets the table. At the song's bridge, Stefani accidentally cuts herself with a knife and Kanal drops a pot of pasta sauce; both of them promptly clean up their messes as dinner is served. Dumont initiates a food fight, and touring members Gabrial McNair and Stephen Bradley join in. The video ends with the ex-lover sitting alone on the swing.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} a woman exiting the taxi {{and going to the}} Los Angeles Union Station. A man exits a car and follows her. Wade then plays the first verse and first chorus in the waiting area of the L. A. Union Station. As the band plays the second verse, they are shown playing at the rooftop with Iron Mountain clearly visible. When the chorus plays again, they are shown at the roof with lights from the {{buildings}} of Downtown Los Angeles at night. When Wade sings the bridge, he is {{on the roof of the}} Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood Boulevard. The man and the woman are also seen running in the boarding area of the Los Angeles Union Station. They later meet up and kiss in one of the boarding platforms of the station in front of a train which later starts to move. The video ends with the band <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> in the waiting hall.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{opens with}} a scene of trucks pulling away from a large, brick building. Oh Land is then seen wearing pink {{overalls}} entering the building and <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> in a folding chair towards the center. As the first verse begins, she stands up and dances around the open space, which continues into the chorus. For the second verse, she is joined by four background dancers, who are now sitting in chairs, much like Oh Land. The singer has changed outfits and is now shown knitting. The next scene has the five women standing spaced apart, before they all begin dancing again. Two female children watch the dancers with curiosity. For the song's refrain, Oh Land rides an all-terrain vehicle, before the video concludes with {{a large group of}} children joining the women for a final dance.|$|E

A waltz accompanies the gallery scene until the picture is shown, leading to Some Day When Dreams Come True as the artist becomes famous. The {{introduction}} with the society woman is accompanied by How Do You Do Miss Josephine and then by So Long Mary as she exits. No Place Like Home begins the next scene until the wife recognizes the emotional distancing of her husband when All I Ask is Love is played. The studio scene begins with I Love My Wife, But Oh You Kid and leads to Be Sweet to Me Kid or Next to your Mother... with Nobody's Little Girl during the crying scene.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} 1994–1995 NBA season, Rodman {{clashed with the}} Spurs front office. He was suspended {{for the first three}} games, took a leave of absence on November 11, and was suspended again on December 7. He finally returned on December 10 after missing 19games. After joining the team, he suffered a shoulder separation in a motorcycle accident, limiting his season to 49games. Normally, he would not have qualified for any season records for missing so many games, but by grabbing 823 rebounds, he just surpassed the 800-rebound limit for listing players and won his fourth straight rebounding title by averaging 16.8 boards per game and made the All-NBA Team. In the 1995 NBA Playoffs, the 62-win Spurs with reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner Robinson entered the Western Conference Finals and were considered favorites against the reigning champions Houston Rockets who had only won 47games. It was thought that Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon {{would have a hard time}} asserting himself versus Robinson and Rodman, who had both been voted into the NBA All-Defensive Teams. However, neither Robinson nor Rodman, who had disrupted a playoff game against the Lakers by <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> on the court, could stop Olajuwon, who averaged 35.3points against the elite defensive Spurs frontcourt, and helped eliminate the Spurs in six games.|$|E
5|$|Neighbours was {{immediately}} bought by Seven's rival Network Ten. The new network {{had to build}} replica sets when it took over production after Seven destroyed the original sets to prevent the rival network obtaining them. Ten began screening the series with episode 171 on 20 January 1986. In 1986, the series was bought by the BBC {{as part of their}} new daytime schedule in the United Kingdom. Neighbours made its debut on BBC1 on 27 October 1986 starting with the pilot episode. It soon gained a loyal audience and the show became particularly popular with younger viewers, and before long was watched by up to 16million viewers - more than the entire population of Australia at the time. In 1988 Neighbours became the only television show to have its entire cast flown over to the UK to make an appearance at the Royal Variety Performance in front of the Queen. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and the seventh longest running serial drama still on the air in the world. In 2005, Neighbours celebrated its 20th anniversary and over twenty former cast members returned for a special episode, which saw them <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> to watch a documentary about Ramsay Street. At the Logie Award ceremony that year, the show was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame.|$|E
