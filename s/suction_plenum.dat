40|$|Suction {{pressure}} pulsations created when the suction valve opens {{are caused by}} unsteady mass flow through the valve exciting acoustic resonances in the <b>suction</b> <b>plenum.</b> These {{pressure pulsations}} influence valve dynamics, compressor performance and compressor noise. This paper will show the importance of including the cylinder bore volume in the flow path analysis in order to accurately calculate pressure pulsations. Pressure pulsations will be calculated using Finite Element Method (FEM) calculated impedance transfer matrix method in a quasi-static solution. The method models the impedance of the <b>suction</b> <b>plenum</b> flow path including cylinder bore volume using a static geometry condition just after the suction valve opens. The interaction between the <b>suction</b> <b>plenum,</b> suction valve port geometry, and cylinder bore volume influence acoustic resonances in this system. These resonances cause pressure pulsations that effect valve dynamics. This paper uncouples {{the dynamics of the}} suction valve from the pressure pulsation modeling. This was done to specifically look at pressure pulsation created due to refrigerant volume flow through the suction valve and <b>suction</b> <b>plenum</b> acoustic resonances without valve dynamics influencing pressure pulsation. The paper then compares simulated <b>suction</b> <b>plenum</b> pressure pulsations when the valve opens to measured pressure pulsation in a reciprocating residential HVAC compressor with good agreement...|$|E
40|$|Rotary {{twin screw}} {{machines}} {{are used in}} the wide range of industrial applications and are capable of handling single and multiphase fluids as compressors, expanders and pumps. Concentration of liquid in the inlet flow can influence the performance of the machine significantly. Characteristics of the multiphase flow at the suction of a screw compressor depend on the local flow velocities and concentration. Local flow velocity measurements inside the screw compressors are difficult to obtain. However other flow properties such as local pressures are easier to attain. It is therefore useful to carry out experiments with local pressure variations in the suction which can be used to validate the 3 D numerical Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models that could help in studying the single and multiphase flow behaviour in screw compressors. This paper presents experimental efforts to measure the local pressure losses inside the <b>suction</b> <b>plenum</b> of the screw compressor. Pressure variations are measured at 23 locations in the suction port at various operating conditions and compared with 3 D CFD model. The grid generator SCORGTM was used for generating numerical mesh of rotors. The flow calculations were carried out using commercial 3 D solver ANSYS CFX. It was found that the local pressure changes predicted by the CFD model are in the good agreement with measured pressures. This validated the use of CFD for modelling of the single phase flows in suction of screw machines...|$|E
40|$|In a {{hermetic}} {{reciprocating compressor}} the suction pressure pulsations affect compressor performance and noise. The pressure pulsations are created {{due to the}} dynamic flow of refrigerant through the suction valve into the cylinder bore. One dimensional (1 D) acoustic method, Finite Element Method (FEM) calculated impedance transfer matrix method, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are three commonly used methods to calculate these pressure pulsations. With CFD being used most often to solve this type of analysis; however CFD is often time consuming and requires significant computer resources. In order to solve the pressure pulsation analyses faster, the <b>suction</b> <b>plenum</b> geometry is often simplified by reducing the model size. This simplification could lead to inaccuracies in pressure pulsation modeling. This paper will use the FEM calculated impedance transfer matrix method to analyze a hermetic HVAC reciprocating compressor to show that geometry simplifications could result in poor predictions of pressure pulsation. The FEM calculated impedance transfer matrix method was chosen due to its short solution time and the inherent ability to compare similarities and differences in the plenum’s impedances between the full model which includes volume inside the compressor shell, and a simplified model. This paper will specifically look at {{the influence of the}} compressor shell volume on simulating suction pressure pulsations. In the compressor analyzed, the compressor shell volume influences the pressure pulsation at the first compressor speed harmonic. A pressure pulsation at the first harmonic has the greatest influence on the compressor performance. This paper will compare measured pressure pulsations to simulated pressure pulsations. The pressure pulsations are in good agreement when the full model is analyzed but when simplifications are done to the model it fails to provide good agreement...|$|E

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of the National Transonic Facility (NTF) section and plenum chamber was developed. The model serves {{as a means for}} {{determining}} the dynamic performance of the NTF and the subsequent design of optimal control configurations, and is of one dimensional flow type as to facilitate computer simulation. The model allows for the simulation of the effects of test section blockage, boundary layer losses, slot flow required for supersonic flow generation, reentry flap position, and auxiliary <b>plenum</b> <b>suction...</b>|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} of an experimental investigation of ventilated-wall interference on dynamic measurements using half-models in four transonic tunnels, {{three of which}} have a slotted roof and floor whilst the other has a perforated roof and floor. It is shown that if wall interference effects are present at subsonic speeds then these probably persist to low supersonic speeds. The supersonic interference {{can be associated with}} an upstream propagation of disturbances in the plenum chambers in a region close to the ventilated walls. The interference effects in the perforated tunnel are comparable with those produced previously when it was fitted with a slotted roof and floor. It is found that variation of diffuser <b>suction</b> to the <b>plenum</b> chambers behind the perforated walls has a significant effect on the damping derivatives. With the half-model technique used, both lift and pitching-moment derivatives are shown to be influenced by the thickness of the side-wall boundary layer, but in many practical cases the effect may be acceptably small...|$|R
40|$|The Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel is a closed-circuit single-return {{atmospheric}} {{wind tunnel}} {{that has a}} slotted octagonal test section with continuous air exchange. The wind tunnel speed can be varied continuously over a Mach number range from 0. 1 to 1. 3. Test-section <b>plenum</b> <b>suction</b> is used for speeds above a Mach number of 1. 05. Over a period of some 40 years, the wind tunnel has undergone many modifications. During the modifications completed in 1990, a new model support system that increased blockage, new fan blades, a catcher screen for {{the first set of}} turning vanes, and process controllers for tunnel speed, model attitude, and jet flow for powered models were installed. This report presents a complete description of the Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel and auxiliary equipment, the calibration procedures, and the results of the 1977 and the 1990 wind tunnel calibration with test section air removal. Comparisons with previous calibrations showed that the modifications made to the wind tunnel had little or no effect on the aerodynamic characteristics of the tunnel. Information required for planning experimental investigations and the use of test hardware and model support systems is also provided...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{efficiency}} of positive displacement compressors requires improving current computer compressor simulations to better model compressor behavior. This paper will specifically look at increasing fidelity of the 1 D thermodynamic compressor simulation program by incorporating suction and discharge pulsations due to complex suction and discharge three dimensional (3 D) plenum geometry. This method allows for quick pressure pulsation analysis and enables the design engineer {{to make changes}} early in the compressor development cycle. Finite Element Method (FEM) full harmonic analysis {{is used to calculate}} <b>suction</b> or discharge <b>plenum’s</b> impedance transfer functions in the frequency domain. The impedance transfer functions are normalized to the FEM conditions and normalized impedance transfer functions are used to model all compressor operating speeds and operating conditions. The normalized impedance transfer functions are independent of mass flow, compressor speed, valve dynamics, sonic velocity, refrigerant density, refrigerant, bore size and stroke size which allow the 1 D compressor simulation program to change any of these variables without have to solve for a new FEM impedance transfer function. We have also worked on a new way to include damping and phase shift between mass flow and pressure pulsations that better agrees with experimental and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results. Since some of this method is novel or may extend beyond the limits of linear acoustic analysis, it requires good agreement to compressor test results and to CFD results. The main part of the paper will show good agreement between simulated pressure pulsations to suction and discharge test results in a reciprocating compressor. The paper will also show our latest improvements in pulsation modeling to obtain better agreement to CFD resultsthan the original comparison in Bilal et al (2010) ...|$|R
