40|$|Abstract Background Understanding {{transmission}} {{dynamics of}} the pandemic influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus in various exposure settings and determining whether transmissibility differed from seasonal influenza viruses was a priority for decision making on mitigation strategies {{at the beginning of}} the pandemic. The objective of this study was to estimate household <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> for pandemic influenza in a susceptible population where control measures had yet to be implemented. Methods All Ontario local health units were invited to participate; seven health units volunteered. For all laboratory-confirmed cases reported between April 24 and June 18, 2009, participating health units performed contact tracing to detect secondary cases among household contacts. In total, 87 cases and 266 household contacts were included in this study. Secondary cases were defined as any household member with new onset of acute respiratory illness (fever or two or more respiratory symptoms) or influenza-like illness (fever plus one additional respiratory symptom). <b>Attack</b> <b>rates</b> were estimated using both case definitions. Results <b>Secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> were estimated at 10. 3 % (95 % CI 6. 8 - 14. 7) for secondary cases with influenza-like illness and 20. 2 % (95 % CI 15. 4 - 25. 6) for secondary cases with acute respiratory illness. For both case definitions, <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> were significantly higher in children under 16 years than adults (25. 4 % and 42. 4 % compared to 7. 6 % and 17. 2 %). The median time between symptom onset in the primary case and the secondary case was estimated at 3. 0 days. Conclusions <b>Secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> for pandemic influenza A (H 1 N 1) were comparable to seasonal influenza estimates suggesting similarities in transmission.

In studies of <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> in the compound, vaccine efficacy was 91 % (75 %- 97 %) for EZ-HT, 85 % (40 %- 96 %) for SW-HT, and 100 % for SW-std. <b>Attack</b> <b>rates</b> were correlated with intensity of exposure (P= 0. 0006), being much higher for children exposed in the same hut than for those living in the same com-pound but in a different household (relative risk= 3. 36 [1. 32 - 8. 57]).

Methods 135 households had chronological information on symptoms and oseltamivir usage for all household members. The effect of oseltamivir treatment and other factors on the household <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> was estimated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression with households as the unit of analysis. The effect of oseltamivir treatment and other factors on the individual <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> was estimated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression with individual household contacts as the unit of analysis, and a generalized estimating equations approach was used to fit the model to allow for clustering within households. Results Oseltamivir index treatment on onset day or the following day (early treatment) was associated with a 42 % reduction (OR: 0. 58, 95 % CI: 0. 19, 1. 73) in the odds of one or more secondary infections in a household and a 50 % reduction (OR: 0. 5, 95 % CI: 0. 17, 1. 46) in the odds of a secondary infection in individual contacts. The confidence bounds are wide due to a small sample of households with early oseltamivir index usage - in 29 such households, 5 had a secondary attack. Younger household contacts were at higher risk of infection (OR: 2. 79, 95 % CI: 1. 50 - 5. 20).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{household}} contact substudy {{was performed}} {{as part of}} a prospective, cohort pertussis vaccine efficacy trial in Germany. DESIGN: Infants received four doses of either the Lederle/Takeda acellular pertussis component diphtheria-tetanus toxoids (DTP) vaccine (DTaP) or Lederle whole-cell component DTP vaccine at 3, 4. 5, 6, and 15 to 18 months of age (Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines and Pediatrics, Pearl River, NY). An open control group received three doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids vaccine (DT) at 3, 4. 5, and 15 to 18 months of age. Vaccine efficacy rates were calculated using a number of principal and ancillary case definitions for primary, secondary, and noncases by analyzing <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> in study infants after exposure to pertussis in the household using 7 - to 28 - and 7 - to 42 -day postexposure observation periods and the inclusion and the exclusion of noncases who received macrolide antibiotics or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during the exposure period. RESULTS: During a 3. 5 -year study period, 10271 infants (DTP or DTaP, n = 8532; DT, n = 1739) were enrolled and actively followed along with all household members for cough illnesses. Depending on the case definition, 160 to 519 household exposures to pertussis were identified. In general, <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> in DT recipients were low and this was primarily because of the frequent use of antimicrobial prophylaxis. Using the principal case definitions and the exclusion of noncases who received macrolide antibiotics or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during the exposure period and the 7 - to 42 -day observation period, the efficacy of DTP against cough illness of {{greater than or equal to}} 7 days duration caused by Bordetella pertussis was 84 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 65 - 93) and that of DTaP was 58 % (95 % CI = 30 - 75). Using similar criteria, the efficacy against typical pertussis (greater than or equal to 21 days of cough with either paroxysms, whoop, or posttussive vomiting) was 94 % (95 CI = 77 - 99) and 86 % (95 % CI = 62 - 95) for DTP and DTaP, respectively. The efficacy against any cough illness (with or without) laboratory confirmation was 54 % (95 % CI = 32 - 69) and 38 % (95 % CI = 13 - 56) for DTP and DTaP, respectively. CONCLUSION: This household contact substudy within our cohort study, with active investigator-generated surveillance, was a severe test of vaccine efficacy. Both vaccines (DTP and DTaP) are better at preventing typical pertussis than mild illness. When case definitions similar to those in other recent trials are used, the Lederle/Takeda vaccine has an efficacy similar to other multicomponent DTaP vaccines...|$|R
40|$|The {{transmission}} of influenza viruses occurs {{person to person}} and is facilitated by contacts within enclosed environments such as households. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate secondary attack rates and factors associated with household {{transmission of}} laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 in the pandemic and post-pandemic seasons. During the 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011 influenza seasons, 76 sentinel physicians in Navarra, Spain, took nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal swabs from patients diagnosed with influenza-like illness. A trained nurse telephoned households of those patients who were laboratory-confirmed for influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 to ask about the symptoms, risk factors and vaccination status of each household member. In the 405 households with a patient laboratory-confirmed for influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09, 977 susceptible contacts were identified; 16 % of them (95 % CI 14 - 19 %) presented influenza-like illness and were considered as secondary cases. The <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> was 14 % in 2009 - 2010 and 19 % in the 2010 - 2011 season (p= 0. 049), an increase that mainly affected persons with major chronic conditions. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk of being a secondary case was higher in the 2010 - 2011 season than in the 2009 - 2010 season (adjusted odds ratio: 1. 72; 95 % CI 1. 17 - 2. 54), and in children under 5 years, with a decreasing risk in older contacts. Influenza vaccination was associated with lesser incidence of influenza-like illness near to statistical significance (adjusted odds ratio: 0. 29; 95 % CI 0. 08 - 1. 03). The <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> in households was higher in the second season than in the first pandemic season. Children had a greater risk of infection. Preventive measures should be maintained in the second pandemic season, especially in high-risk persons...|$|E
40|$|From June 1972 to May 1973 {{the medical}} officer {{of health and}} general {{practitioners}} in Sheffield referred all suspected cases of scabies to the Hallamshire Hospital skin department. Contact tracing, {{similar to that in}} VD departments, was carried out by a specially trained state registered nurse. In all, 1482 cases were found in 609 households. This was ten times the number referred to the skin department in 1971. Infestation was introduced to households mainly by schoolchildren and teenagers, especially by girls. The commonest sources were friends and relatives outside the home. Schools did not play an appreciable part in spread. The <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> in households was 38 %. Notification of cases, adequate treatment within the home, and contact tracing are recommended to halt the present epidemic of scabies...|$|E
40|$|Background: During an {{influenza}} pandemic, {{a substantial}} proportion of transmission {{is thought to}} occur in households. We used data on influenza progression in individuals and their contacts collected by the City of Milwaukee Health Department (MHD) to study the transmission of pandemic influenza A/H 1 N 1 virus in 362 households in Milwaukee, WI, {{and the effects of}} oseltamivir treatment and chemoprophylaxis. Methods: 135 households had chronological information on symptoms and oseltamivir usage for all household members. The effect of oseltamivir treatment and other factors on the household <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> was estimated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression with households as the unit of analysis. The effect of oseltamivir treatment and other factors on the individual <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> was estimated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression with individual household contacts as the unit of analysis, and a generalized estimating equations approach was used to fit the model to allow for clustering within households. Results: Oseltamivir index treatment on onset day or the following day (early treatment) was associated with a 42 % reduction (OR: 0. 58, 95 % CI: 0. 19, 1. 73) in the odds of one or more secondary infections in a household and a 50 % reduction (OR: 0. 5, 95 % CI: 0. 17, 1. 46) in the odds of a secondary infection in individual contacts. The confidence bounds are wide due to a small sample of households with early oseltamivir index usage - in 29 such households, 5 had a secondary attack. Younger household contacts were at higher risk of infection (OR: 2. 79, 95 % CI: 1. 50 - 5. 20). Conclusions: Early oseltamivir treatment may be beneficial in preventing H 1 N 1 pdm influenza transmission; this may have relevance to future control measures for influenza pandemics. Larger randomized trials are needed to confirm this finding statistically. © 2010 Goldstein et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Bordetella {{pertussis}} (whooping cough) is an endemic, highly contagious bacterial respiratory infection, {{which is}} notifiable to Australian state and territory health departments. Between 2008 and 2011 {{there was a}} substantial outbreak in New South Wales with an initial increase in cases occurring in North Coast New South Wales from late 2007. During September and October 2011 the North Coast Public Health Unit conducted a household study of <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> to assess the effectiveness of pertussis vaccination {{as well as the}} timely use of antibiotics in preventing household transmission. At the time the study was commenced, notified cases included a large proportion of individuals with a documented history of vaccination against pertussis. We found lower <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> amongst vaccinated compared with non-vaccinated subjects in all age groups, {{with the exception of the}} 5 - 11 years age group, who were also primarily responsible for the introduction of pertussis into the household. There was an increased risk of pertussis transmission from the household first primary case to contacts when antibiotic treatment was commenced later than 7 days after the onset of symptoms compared with within 7 days. This protective effect of timely antibiotic treatment in relation to transmission highlights the need to control for antibiotic treatment in field studies of pertussis. The benefits of timely diagnosis and use of antibiotics in preventing household transmission underscore the importance of early presentation and diagnosis of pertussis cases, particularly in households with susceptible occupants...|$|R
40|$|Lassa fever is {{an acute}} viral hemorrhagic illness; {{the virus is}} endemic in West Africa and also of concern with regard to bioterrorism. Transmission of Lassa virus between humans may occur through direct contact with {{infected}} blood or bodily secretions. Oral administration of the antiviral drug ribavirin is often considered for postexposure prophylaxis, but no systematically collected data or uniform guidelines exist for this indication. Furthermore, the relatively low <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> for Lassa fever, the restriction of the area of endemicity to West Africa, and the infrequency of high-risk exposures make it unlikely that controlled prospective efficacy trials will ever be possible. Recommendations for postexposure use of ribavirin can therefore be made only {{on the basis of}} a thorough understanding and logical extrapolation of existing data. Here, we review the pertinent issues and propose guidelines based on extensive review of the literature, as well as our experience in this field. We recommend oral ribavirin postexposure prophylaxis for Lassa fever exclusively for definitive high-risk exposures. These guidelines may also serve for exposure to other hemorrhagic fever viruses susceptible to ribavirin. Lassa fever is an acute and sometimes severe viral hem-orrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus, a member of the virus family Arenaviridae. The virus is endemic in part...|$|R
40|$|The {{interval}} between successive cases of an infectious disease {{is determined by}} the time from infection to infectiousness, the duration of infectiousness, the time from infection to disease onset (incubation period), the duration of any extra-human phase of the infectious agent, and the proportion clinically affected among infected individuals. The interval is important in the interpretation of infectious disease surveillance and trend data, in the identification of outbreaks, and in the optimization of quarantine and contact tracing. This paper discusses the properties of these intervals, as measured between transmission events or between clinical onsets of successive infected individuals, noting the determinants of their ranges and frequency distributions, the circumstances under which secondary cases may arise before primaries, and under which the infection transmission interval will be different from the {{interval between}} clinical onsets of successive cases. It discusses the derivation of interval distribution statistics from descriptive data given in standard textbooks, with illustrations from published data on outbreaks, households, and epidemiologic tracing. Finally, it discusses the implications of such measures for studies of <b>secondary</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rates,</b> for the persistence of infection in human communities, for outbreak response, and for elimination or eradication programs. communicable diseases; disease outbreaks Abbreviation: AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome...|$|R
