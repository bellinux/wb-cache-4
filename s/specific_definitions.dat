5|$|Heavy metals are {{generally}} defined as metals with relatively high densities, atomic weights, or atomic numbers. The criteria used, and whether metalloids are included, {{vary depending on}} the author and context. In metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, while a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour. More <b>specific</b> <b>definitions</b> have been published, but none of these have been widely accepted. The definitions surveyed in this article encompass up to 96 out of the 118 known chemical elements; only mercury, lead and bismuth meet all of them. Despite this lack of agreement, the term (plural or singular) is widely used in science. A density of more than 5g/cm3 is sometimes quoted as a commonly used criterion and is used in the body of this article.|$|E

2500|$|After {{reviewing}} the existing {{law on the}} subject of vagueness, starting with the Supreme Court's decision in Grayned v. City of Rockford eight years earlier, Leighton considered Hoffman Estates' ordinance. [...] "It is obvious that [...] is not a model of legislative clarity," [...] he began. [...] "Its purpose, nonetheless, is evident." [...] The words [...] "item", [...] "effect", [...] "paraphernalia", [...] "accessory" [...] or even [...] "thing" [...] were not used in a technical sense; [...] "they are, in fact, ordinary words." [...] Since no precedent had considered their definition, he resorted to a dictionary and found clear and <b>specific</b> <b>definitions</b> for all but one. To get a better handle on the remaining word, [...] "paraphernalia", he looked to a 1954 decision in a bookmaking case by a California appellate court, which noted that it was [...] "not a technical word in the law of crimes, although it may be in the law of property." [...] More recently, he noted, both law enforcement and drug users had begun referring to the items targeted by the ordinance collectively as parpahernalia, and the Eighth Circuit had taken notice of that usage in a case where it upheld the seizure of such items based on search warrant which had used the word.|$|E

6000|$|I may here {{allude to}} a {{remarkable}} memoir lately published by A. de Candolle, on the oaks {{of the whole}} world. No one ever had more ample materials for the discrimination of the species, or could have worked on them with more zeal and sagacity. He first gives in detail all the many points of structure which vary in the several species, and estimates numerically the relative frequency of the variations. He specifies above a dozen characters which may be found varying even on the same branch, sometimes according to age or development, sometimes without any assignable reason. Such characters are not of course of specific value, but they are, as Asa Gray has remarked in commenting on this memoir, such as generally enter into <b>specific</b> <b>definitions.</b> De Candolle {{then goes on to}} say that he gives the rank of species to the forms that differ by characters never varying on the same tree, and never found connected by intermediate states. After this discussion, the result of so much labour, he emphatically remarks: [...] "They are mistaken, who repeat that the greater part of our species are clearly limited, and that the doubtful species are in a feeble minority. This seemed to be true, so long as a genus was imperfectly known, and its species were founded upon a few specimens, that is to say, were provisional. Just as we come to know them better, intermediate forms flow in, and doubts as to specific limits augment." [...] He also adds that it is the best known species which present the greatest number of spontaneous varieties and sub-varieties. Thus Quercus robur has twenty-eight varieties, all of which, excepting six, are clustered round three sub-species, namely Q. pedunculata, sessiliflora and pubescens. The forms which connect these three sub-species are comparatively rare; and, as Asa Gray again remarks, if these connecting forms which are now rare were to become totally extinct the three sub-species would hold exactly the same relation to each other as do the four or five provisionally admitted species which closely surround the typical Quercus robur. Finally, De Candolle admits that out of the 300 species, which will be enumerated in his Prodromus as belonging to the oak family, at least two-thirds are provisional species, that is, are not known strictly to fulfil the definition above given of a true species. It should be added that De Candolle no longer believes that species are immutable creations, but concludes that the derivative theory is the most natural one, [...] "and the most accordant with the known facts in palaeontology, geographical botany and zoology, of anatomical structure and classification." ...|$|E
