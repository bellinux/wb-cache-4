25|$|According to Alastair Macaulay (formerly chief dance {{critic of}} The Times Literary Supplement and chief theatre {{critic of the}} Financial Times, now chief dance critic for The New York Times), the Ondine myth {{is said to be}} an image of psycho-sexual distress: the nymph is a forlorn image of {{repressed}} virginity, anxious that <b>she</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> achieve womanly fulfillment, while her feminine nemesis that leads her husband astray represents the confident seductive power that threatens her hopes.
