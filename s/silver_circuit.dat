5000|$|Meet Your Mechanical Masters was Servotron's debut release. It was {{released}} in 1995 on Sympathy for the Record Industry (cited on the sleeve as Sympathy for the Machines). This single {{was released}} on purple vinyl and black vinyl. It was re-released as a <b>silver</b> <b>circuit</b> board picture disc as the [...] "Super Expensive Ultra Limited Totally Bitchen' Silver Disc". [...] "People Mover" [...] is a song about vehicles at the Atlanta airport.|$|E
50|$|Aspen grew {{larger and}} more prosperous the {{following}} year when Congress passed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, mandating federal purchases of the metal. The population swelled to almost 10,000, the greatest ever. The Wheeler became a stop on a popular touring route called the <b>Silver</b> <b>Circuit,</b> working its way from Denver through Leadville, over the Divide and through Aspen to Utah and eventually ending at Cheyenne, Wyoming. Along it audiences got to see everything from Shakespeare and classical music to vaudeville and boxing.|$|E
50|$|Flexible electronics, {{also known}} as flex circuits, is a {{technology}} for assembling electronic circuits by mounting electronic devices on flexible plastic substrates, such as polyimide, PEEK or transparent conductive polyester film. Additionally, flex circuits can be screen printed <b>silver</b> <b>circuits</b> on polyester. Flexible electronic assemblies may be manufactured using identical components used for rigid printed circuit boards, allowing the board to conform to a desired shape, or to flex during its use. An alternative approach to flexible electronics suggests various etching techniques to thin down the traditional silicon substrate to few tens of micrometers to gain reasonable flexibility, referred to as flexible silicon (~ 5 mm bending radius).|$|R
40|$|Nearly every {{microsystem}} application requires specific packaging solutions. In {{this paper}} we suggest {{a new approach}} to use layer manufacturing as a generic tool for microsystem integration. Three different methods to produce 3 D electrical interconnects are presented. Ink jet printing is used for the ceramic layer manufacturing process, {{as well as for the}} printing of <b>silver</b> for <b>circuit</b> patterns. The technique is demonstrated for an Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU) platform. A four-sided pyramid was manufactured with layer manufacturing in ceramics and four gyroscopes were mounted on the sides of the pyramid. A demonstrator with three light diodes was also manufactured to demonstrate the possibility to produce 3 D electrical interconnects in the volume of the pyramid...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To {{achieve a}} {{satisfied}} conductivity of nano-size <b>silver</b> printed <b>circuit,</b> post deal with nano-size silver conductive film was investigated. Based on {{the preparation of}} nano-size conductive ink and conductive circuit, the coated conductive film was treated by series concentrations of hydrochloride solutions, and then scanned by laser beam. The influence of resolutions concentration and dipping time were investigated separately. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and four-probe tester, were applied to characterize the different tested samples. It was found that when the coated silver conductive ink samples were dipped in 20 % hydrochloride for 60 min, 15 ℃ before laser scanning, the conductivity reaches 0. 3 Ω/ϒ. It is therefore considered that the “dip in ” method provide an efficient alternative to improve the conductivity which from nano-size silver ink...|$|R
40|$|Here, {{we report}} on carbon {{nanotube}} paper-based electroanalytical devices. A highly aligned-carbon nanotube (HA-CNT) array, grown using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), was processed to form bi-layered paper with an integrated cellulose-based Origami-chip as the electroanalytical device. We used an inverse-ordered fabrication method from a thick carbon nanotube (CNT) sheet to a thin CNT sheet. A 200 -layered HA-CNT sheet and a 100 -layered HA-CNT sheet are explored as a working electrode. The device was fabricated using the following methods: (1) cellulose-based paper was patterned using a wax printer, (2) electrical connection was made using a <b>silver</b> ink-based <b>circuit</b> printer, and (3) three electrodes were stacked on a 2 D Origami cell. Electrochemical behavior was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). We believe that this platform could attract {{a great deal of}} interest for use in various chemical and biomedical applications...|$|R
40|$|Thin film {{hydrogenated}} {{amorphous silicon}} (a-Si:H) solar cells suffer from weak absorption of long wavelength photons, which have absorption lengths that are far greater than the absorber layer thickness. Light trapping schemes utilizing photonic crystal based back-reflectors can strongly diffract long wavelength photons and increase their optical path length. Photonic crystal back-reflectors were fabricated to investigate optical absorption enhancement in a-Si:H solar cells. Photonic crystal back-reflectors were patterned with photolithography and etched in crystalline silicon wafers using reactive-ion etching. The etched photonic crystals were then coated with silver and aluminum doped zinc oxide for a highly reflective back contact. These structures had triangular lattice symmetry, an etch depth between 200 nm and 250 nm, and a pitch of 760 nm. Scanning electron microscopy images demonstrate high quality long-range periodicity. A-Si:H n-i-p solar cells were deposited on these back-reflectors using standard plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition techniques. Diffuse and total reflection measurements indicate high diffuse reflectance and strong absorption within the photonic crystal. Normalized external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements demonstrated considerable absorption enhancement at near-infrared wavelengths. The photonic crystal back-reflector increased optical absorption {{by a factor of}} 6 to 7 at certain wavelengths, relative to flat reference devices on the same substrate. An enhancement of 8 times was also observed for a reference device on stainless steel coated with flat <b>silver.</b> Short <b>circuit</b> current, as determined by weighting EQE against the AM 1. 5 solar spectrum, increased by over 7 % with the photonic crystal back-reflectors...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: This {{research}} {{attempts to}} optimize the parameters for pulse plating of <b>silver</b> on printed <b>circuit</b> board. The idea here is to use pulse plating technique which is metal deposition by pulsed electrolysis method. Approach: Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) {{plays a major role}} in all communication and electronics industry. Silver is a ductile and malleable metal which has 7 % higher conductivity than copper. Here the electro deposit is influenced by current density, silver concentration in the bath, applied current type. Pulse plating technique is used in double sided printed circuit board especially in the case of plated through hole technique. Here exist a necessity to do plating which will deposit a metal wall in the substrate and it will connect between the components. Results: This method of pulse plating proves that it avoids the disadvantage of rough deposition that is caused due to DC plating in PCB's. Conclusion: The surface morphology and the grain size is measured using XRD analysis and it proves that the number of pin holes is reduced...|$|R
50|$|As of the 2012 Guerra de Empresas show a {{total of}} 70 wrestlers have worked at least one match out of the 33 matches held across the four shows, {{with an average of}} eight matches for each show. IWRG shows {{traditionally}} have five or six matches, but due to the Guerra de Empresas tournaments these shows had a higher average, with two shows hosting {{a total of}} nine matches in one night. Of those seventy wrestlers, six were female, invited specifically for the Guerra de Empresas shows as IWRG does not have a regular women's' division. Four of the participants were Mini-Estrellas, a special division of short stature wrestlers, not necessarily wrestlers with dwarfism, who were also invited specifically for the shows as IWRG also does not regularly feature the Mini-Estrellas wrestlers. Violento Jack, representing Desastre Total Ultraviolento is the only wrestler to work all four IWRG Guerra de Empresas shows. Aeroboy (IWRG), Damián 666 (Perros del Mal), Joe Lider (DTU), Máscara Año 2000, Jr. (IWRG), La Parka (AAA), Psycho Clown (AAA), Sexy Lady (indendent <b>circuit),</b> <b>Silver</b> King (AAA), Último Gladiador (AAA) and X-Fly (PDM) worked on three of the four shows.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{soldiers}} positioned at Tacoma's military bases provided {{the foundation for}} a growing hip-hop fan base in the Northwest. This increased demand for hip-hop coincided with some of the first hip-hop dances in Seattle, which were held at public-housing recreation centers and featured the Emerald Street Boys and Anthony [...] "Sir Mix-A-Lot" [...] Ray. Simultaneously, [...] "Nasty Nes" [...] Rodriguez launched the Northwest's first all-rap radio program, Fresh Tracks, and soon Nasty Nes began airing self-produced tracks by Sir Mix-A-Lot, as well as the Emerald Street Boys, MC LeRap, PDQ, and Andy Hamlin. Fresh Tracks was a 30-minute show that played on Sunday nights on KKFX 1250 ("KFOX" [...] and formerly KKDZ), and consisted of a mix of new songs and a mastermix created by Nasty Nes (Stranger article). These mixes were made up of songs by The World's Famous Supreme Team, Malcolm McLaren, Run-D.M.C. and others (Stranger article). Due to the show's popularity, the station's producer allowed Nes to expand it to a Monday through Friday, 9pm to midnight show called NightBeat that featured prominent R&B songs as well as intermixed rap songs (Stranger article). As Seattle's music scene evolved, so did the Seattle breakdance and graffiti crews, including B-Boy groups like <b>Silver</b> Chain Gang, <b>Circuit</b> Breakers, and Breaking Mechanism, and graffiti writers such as Spaide, DadOne, and Spraycan. At this time the Northwest was considered an empty canvas, which lagged behind other regions in creating a unique identity that was associated with hip hop. With this space there was room for an eclectic group of identities to form, however none were successful in formulating a Seattle identity.|$|R
