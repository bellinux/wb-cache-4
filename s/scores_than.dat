5|$|Overall, Revelation was {{received}} positively by critics; the game garnered 82% and 81% averages on aggregate sites Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively; the Xbox {{version of the}} game received less favorable <b>scores</b> <b>than</b> the computer version. Its computer version sold over 100,000 copies in the United States by August 2006, but was beaten by Myst III: Exiles 400,000 sales in the region. Combined sales of all Myst games released in the 2000s reached 1.6 million units in the United States by August 2006.|$|E
5|$|The game {{retained}} the mechanics and gameplay of its predecessor but introduced new levels, settings and graphics. Former journalist Stuart Campbell designed the game's levels, making them harder and more tactically demanding, {{as well as}} introducing a multitude of pop culture references in the level titles. The development of the game's plot was hampered by budget constraints and the resulting lack of explanation confused reviewers. Critics enjoyed the gameplay retained from the original Cannon Fodder but were disappointed {{at the lack of}} new mechanics or weapons, comparing the game to a data disk. Reviewers praised the game's level design, though less so those of its alien planet. Critics gave Cannon Fodder 2 positive reviews but lower <b>scores</b> <b>than</b> its predecessor and gave mixed criticism of the new theme music and increased difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Timby et al. (2014) also {{assessed}} {{the potential impact}} of MFGM supplementation on cognitive development in term infants. In this double-blind RCT, term infants (<2 months old) were fed until 6 months of age either a control formula (n=64) or an MFGM-supplemented formula (n=71). A breastfed reference group (n=70) was also included. Cognitive assessment done using the BSID-III at 12 months of age showed that the MFGM-fed infants exhibited significantly higher mean cognitive <b>scores</b> <b>than</b> the control group (105.8 vs 101.8; P<0.008), and not significantly different from the breastfed reference group. In contrast, {{there were no significant differences}} in motor domain scores between the three groups, and both experimental and control formula groups scored lower than the reference group in the verbal domain.|$|E

25|$|Child-directed speech also {{catches the}} child's attention, and in {{situations}} where words for new objects are being expressed to the child, this form of speech may help the child recognize the speech cues and the new information provided. Data shows that children raised in highly verbal families had higher language <b>scores</b> <b>than</b> those children raised in low verbal families. Continuously hearing complicated sentences throughout language development increases the child's ability to understand these sentences and then to use complicated sentences as they develop. Studies have shown that students enrolled in high language classrooms have two times the growth in complex sentences usage than students in classrooms where teachers do not frequently use complex sentences.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a flaw in}} how it handled {{very high}} first innings scores (350+) became {{apparent}} from the 1999 Cricket World Cup match in Bristol between India and Kenya. Tony Lewis noticed {{that there was an}} inherent weakness in the formula that would give a noticeable advantage to the side chasing a total in excess of 350. A correction was built into the formula and the software, but was not fully adopted until 2004. One-day matches were achieving significantly higher <b>scores</b> <b>than</b> in previous decades, affecting the historical relationship between resources and runs. The second version uses more sophisticated statistical modelling, but does not use a single table of resource percentages. Instead, the percentages also vary with score, so a computer is required. Therefore, it loses some of the previous advantages of transparency and simplicity.|$|E

25|$|David R. Hekman {{and colleagues}} {{found that men}} receive {{significantly}} higher customer satisfaction <b>scores</b> <b>than</b> equally well-performing women. Customers who viewed videos featuring a female and a male actor {{playing the role of}} an employee helping a customer were 19% more satisfied with the male employee's performance and also were more satisfied with the store's cleanliness and appearance although the actors performed identically, read the same script, and were in exactly the same location with identical camera angles and lighting. In a second study, they found that male doctors were rated as more approachable and competent than equally well performing female doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that customer ratings tend to be inconsistent with objective indicators of performance and should not be uncritically used to determine pay and promotion opportunities. They contend that customer biases have potential adverse effects on female employees' careers.|$|E
25|$|The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, {{sometimes}} shortened to the CMAS, {{was created}} in 1956. This scale was closely modeled after the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. It was developed so that the TMAS {{could be applied to}} a broader range of people, specifically children. Kitano tested the validity of the CMAS by comparing students who were placed in special education classes versus those placed in regular classrooms. Kitano proposed the idea that children who were in special education classes {{were more likely to have}} higher anxiety than those in regular classrooms. Using the CMAS, Kitano found boys tested in the special education classes had higher anxiety <b>scores</b> <b>than</b> their regular classroom counterparts. Hafner tested the reliability of the CMAS with the knowledge that the TMAS had a feminine bias. Hafner found that the CMAS did not have a female bias. He only found two questions that females always scored higher on than their male counterparts. As the test stands now, the suggestion is to compare the female and male participants separately. Castaneda found significant differences across different grade levels, indicating that as students develop they are affected differentially by various stressors.|$|E

500|$|Although nearly identical, the game's PC version {{garnered}} lower review <b>scores</b> <b>than</b> its Nintendo 64 counterpart, with an aggregated GameRankings {{score of}} 80 percent. This version enjoyed {{many of the}} same praises for its gameplay, but handling and graphics were cited as problematic. Directly comparing the two versions, AllGame's Brad Cook wrote that PC version's handling is more difficult than the N64 version. He believed the PC's [...] "choppy" [...] feel made it difficult to target enemies. In contrast to its opinion of the N64 version, IGN's PC review was not enthusiastic about the game's visuals. IGN staff remarked that Rogue Squadrons [...] "graphics and special effects aren't spectacular" [...] and that they had [...] "seen better graphics" [...] on the PC.|$|E
500|$|The PC version shared much of {{the console}} version's praise, but the {{controls}} and responsiveness of the camera caused criticism. The Game Boy Advance version garnered lower <b>scores</b> <b>than</b> the console and PC versions due to its scaled-down gameplay and presentation, but was still generally praised as a competent port of the game. Nintendo Power said that [...] "Acrobatic moves and inventive traps have never been as free-flowing {{as they are in}} [...] ". Reviewing the mobile version, IGN reviewer Levi Buchanan was impressed by the company's adaptation of the console game's basic actions and atmosphere, giving it a score of 9.5 out of 10. 1UP reviewer Corey Padnos was pleased with the Prince's acrobatic performance and the game's general performance, while lamenting the lack of the time-based mechanics of the main games and the lack of plot.|$|E
500|$|With {{aggregated}} {{scores of}} 57percent and 54 from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively, Battle for Naboos PC port garnered significantly lower review <b>scores</b> <b>than</b> its Nintendo 64 counterpart. Many {{complaints about the}} PC version stemmed {{from the fact that}} the game was not optimized for the PC when it was ported. Computer Games Magazines Adam Fleet thought the game was ugly, citing [...] "truly bland textures and sad-looking 2D sprites". Next Generations Jim Preston bluntly wrote that the [...] "graphics suck." [...] Of the audio, GameSpot's Giancarlo Varanini wrote, [...] " [...] isn't that bad, but it isn't quite as good as the audio in other similar games", and goes on to describe the music as sounding [...] "tinny." [...] Varanini also took issue with the PC version's aiming controls, stating that because Battle for Naboo was originally designed for the Nintendo 64's analog controller, it is difficult to aim using a PC's digital keyboard. Preston agreed, writing that controlling the game is [...] "nearly impossible" [...] with a digital controller or mouse.|$|E

500|$|With the {{exception}} of the game's critically acclaimed Nintendo 64 port, most later releases of Resident Evil 2 have received slightly lower <b>scores</b> <b>than</b> the PlayStation version. Weigand advised players who already owned Resident Evil 2 to rent the Dual Shock Ver. for the [...] "Extreme Battle" [...] minigame, and recommended that newcomers buy the updated edition instead of the original release. The Windows port was praised for its additional content, but criticized for not allowing the player to save at will, and for lacking updated backgrounds to fit the higher in-game resolution. The Nintendo 64 version was widely commended for the technical achievement of fitting a two-disc game on a single 512-Mbit (64MB) cartridge. However, Taylor criticized the game for retaining scenes from the PlayStation version that were used to conceal loading times– a technical disadvantage of optical discs that cartridges do not share. A GamePro writer under the pseudonym [...] "The Freshman" [...] was impressed with the enhanced graphics of the Nintendo 64 port, but was disappointed by its heavily compressed CG FMVs. GameSpot's Joe Fielder found the compression to be forgivable given the cartridge format, and noted that the new exclusive features made up for the lack of the [...] "Extreme Battle" [...] mode. IGN reviewer Matt Casamassina applauded the implementation of Dolby Surround support, and called the Nintendo 64 release the [...] "best version of the game".|$|E
500|$|English {{publications}} {{have given}} Kingdom Hearts 3D moderately positive reviews, with lower <b>scores</b> <b>than</b> Japanese review outlets, generally praising the gameplay while criticizing the plot.

Game Informer writer Bryan Vore praised the new gameplay elements and, unlike other reviewers, {{how well the}} story handles the franchise's plot, especially as it was set after that of Kingdom Hearts II, unlike {{many of the other}} newer titles in the series. Audrey Drake from IGN echoed similar comments about the gameplay, but felt that the story was sometimes not very interesting. Mark Walton from GameSpot praised the combat systems and environment design, though he wished that the game didn't force the player through the levels linearly and dismissed the plot as [...] "labyrinth-like" [...] with poor dialogue and confusing motivations. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com was harsher on the game than other reviewers; while he too found the plot incomprehensible, he also felt that the numerous game mechanics combined together to form a confusing and frustrating system. The reviewer for GameTrailers had a different take, finding the combination of mechanics to form [...] "the best battle system in the series to date" [...] and was not as dismissive of the plot, though they did note that it required a lot of knowledge of previous games in the series to follow. Leah Jackson of G4 had one of the highest reviews for the game out of the major English review outlets; though she had similar praises and criticisms as other reviewers, she felt that the gameplay and graphics more than made up for the sometimes confusing plot.|$|E
