40|$|This work {{is about}} water waves which slosh {{back and forth}} inside a tank which is free to move {{horizontally}} under {{the action of the}} waves inside. The tank may also be acted upon by horizontal restoring forces which only respond to the tank’s displacement, or the tank may be unconstrained. In this sense the work is motivated by wave loads which are strong enough to overcome fixed constraints and move the container in which the wave is sloshing. Significant wave loads are encountered in the haulage industry when bulk liquids are carried in partially filled tankers, especially when the tankers are manoeuvering. Very large liquid movements, such as suddenly erupting jets, can be made by quite small displacements of the container. The jets can ascend the container walls and damage the roof. So predicting the circumstances under which such jets might occur would be a useful theory. In the tank which we treat, some possible motions of the system include periodic solutions, in which the tank oscillates with a single frequency ω while waves are sloshing inside the tank and the tank is also moving with frequency ω. The purpose of the work to be presented is to find the mode shapes of the moving free-surface elevation η, the potential φ(x, y, t) of the un-derlying velocity field, and the influence of the shape of the tank’s boundary on the frequency of oscillation. We concentrate on flow in two space dimensions in tanks with plane walls for which simple expressions for the motion can be found. This topic is specialised and different from the bulk of past contributions to sloshing. <b>In</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>tanks</b> see for example Evans and Linton (1993).

40|$|Abstract: The {{mathematical}} model that described {{the relationship between}} cell−count de− cay and <b>storage</b> time <b>in</b> <b>fixed</b> bacterioplankton samples from three Antarctic lakes of differ− ing trophic status was determined after a one−year experiment. Bacterial density was esti− mated by epifluorescence microscopy. Cell count data fitted a negative exponential model in all three cases (p < 0. 00001). However, the slopes of their curves were significantly dif− ferent (p < 0. 01), {{as well as the}} percentage of bacterial loss after a period of two months. This fact might be related to the limnological characteristics of the water bodies, though the individual genetic variability of their bacterioplankton should not be left aside. Original bacterial numbers in the samples could also be a reason of the differences observed in the pattern of decay in cell counts. Thus, applying a general decay function to any sample and assuming the idea that freshwater bacterioplankton samples can be stored for a two month−period before the bacterial counts decay, can lead to an erroneous estimation of bac− terial numbers with direct consequences in ecological investigations.

Reserpine markedly depresses the levels of stored serotonin in human and animal platelets, accompanied by a small decrease in platelet ATP but no change in platelet ADP content. Thin sections of human platelets showed {{no change in the}} number or morphology of serotonin storage organelles during reserpine therapy, whereas a profound decrease in the size and number of dense bodies occurred in platelets from rabbits treated with reserpine. Dog platelets also showed a decrease in the number and density of serotonin storage organelles after reserpine therapy.

Most of the dense bodies <b>in</b> <b>fixed</b> human platelets were removed by EDTA while rabbit platelet dense bodies remained essentially intact.

40|$|A {{previous}} investigation of sloshing in liquid-container interaction systems {{has shown that}} sloshing frequencies of the liquid are almost not affected by structures having a first natural frequency much {{higher than that of}} the liquid sloshing frequencies. However, for large and more flexible tanks as occur in LNG ships, the floating frequencies of the ship are normally of a similar low value to the sloshing frequencies of the liquid in a tank. Therefore, the coupling between the sloshing liquid, the floating structure and seaway is of importance in characterising the dynamic behaviour of the complete system. In this paper, an integrated liquid – LNG tank – water interaction system is numerically investigated. It is shown that complex coupling mechanisms exist within the overall integrated system. To illustrate the findings six cases are studied. Namely, 1) liquid sloshing <b>in</b> a <b>fixed</b> rigid <b>tank,</b> 2) sloshing of external water, 3) elastic tank only, 4) internal liquid-tank interaction, 5) elastic tank- external water interaction and 6) internal liquid-elastic tank-external water interaction.

The guidelines proposed may be of use for the dynamic design of LNG carriers to ensure safety whilst operating in a rough seaway...|$|R

Knowing the repartition and propagation of light around the light applicator could be the first step towards optimizing dosimetry. Here we propose a characterization method of the illumination profile of a specific light device. METHODS: The light wand, made of a cylindrical diffuser located inside an endotracheal tube, was <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> a <b>tank</b> filled with dilute 0. 01 % intralipid. Light dosimetry was performed around the tip of the wand using two complementary methods: direct measurements of light power with an isotropic probe and measurements of light distribution characterization. RESULTS: Dosimetry with the isotropic probe showed an ellipse-shaped illumination. An optimized effective attenuation coefficient was deduced. Combined with the spatial representation, a theoretical illumination profile was established with iso-surfaces of fluence rate, defining a gradient light dose according to the distance from the diffuser. CONCLUSION: A theoretical illumination profile of a light device was established and could be part of an intra-operative dosimetry system to improve light delivery during intrapleural PDT.

50|$|As {{a result}} of the accidents, CAL FIRE decided that better {{approach}} would be for the agency to own and operate its own helicopters. In 1981, CAL FIRE leased 12 excess UH-1F Hueys which had previously been used by the USAF in Vietnam. Nine helicopters were initially reconditioned, and were operated as non-certificated, public-use aircraft. The first helicopter was built up November, 1981 and was placed in service at Hemet-Ryan Helitack Base. Six more F Model Hueys were built up and placed in service at helitack bases throughout California in the summer of 1982. During the first two years CAL FIRE employed “Personal Service Contract” pilots. Each base was assigned a full-time pilot and a seasonal relief pilot who covered two bases. The majority of the contract pilots became state employees in 1984. The helitack unit was designed to be a cohesive unit which consisted of the helicopter and helitack crew. A typical configuration for the helicopter was a Helitack Fire Captain in the copilot's seat and a Helitack Fire Captain plus six fire-fighters in the passenger compartment. The water bucket was replaced in 1984 with a newly designed Canadian 324-gallon Bambi bucket. <b>In</b> the mid-1980s, <b>fixed</b> water dropping <b>tanks</b> were installed on several helicopters.

Cholesterol (greater than 97 % unesterified) accounted for half of the total lipid, and sphingomyelin accounted for another 20 %. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were also present in substantial quantities.

40|$|Following {{a general}} {{description}} {{and analysis of}} the fundamental criteria for the dynamic design concerning dynamic stiffness, strength and environment issues, it is considered that the natural characteristics of the dynamic system and the dynamic responses of the system subject to various dynamic loads are two key critical issues in the dynamic design. Therefore, for the dynamic design of a LNG tank filled with liquid and operated on seaway, it is necessary to accurately predict its natural characteristics and dynamic response considering fluid structure interactions. To address these two key issues in the dynamic design stage, the developed computer software based on a mixed displacement–pressure finite element model to complete fluid-structure interaction analysis is introduced. An integrated internal liquid-tank-external water interaction system investigated by numerical simulations is summarised to consider the two issues involving the dynamic design of LNG tanks. The five studied cases include: i) 50 % filled LNG liquid <b>in</b> a <b>fixed</b> rigid <b>tank,</b> ii) elastic tank only, iii) 50 % filled LNG liquid-elastic tank interaction, iv) empty elastic tank-external sea water interaction and v) internally 50 % filled LNG liquid-elastic tank-external sea water interaction. The calculated results are compared to reveal the coupling effects on the dynamic design of LNG tanks. To further demonstrate the effects of the natural characteristics affected by different interactions on the dynamic responses involving the dynamic strength, stiffness and vibration environment problems considered in dynamic design, the numerical simulations of the studied systems subject to regular sea wave excitations and earthquake excitations are carried out. The dynamic displacements for stiffness analysis, the dynamic stress for strength analysis and vibration level for dynamic environment analysis are presented and discussed. Guidelines provided in this paper maybe useful for dynamic designs of LNG tank operating in complex marine environments. <br/...|$|R
