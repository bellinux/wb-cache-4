25|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} the non-radiative transition between 3E and 1A {{is that it is}} stronger for ms = ±1 and weaker for ms = 0. This property results in a very useful manipulation of N-V center, which is called optical spin-polarization. First, an off-resonance excitation which has a higher frequency (typically 2.32 eV (532nbsp&nm)) than the frequencies of all transitions and thus lays in the vibronic bands for all transitions. By using a pulse of this wavelength, people can excite all spin states and create phonons as well. For a <b>spin</b> <b>state</b> with ms = 0, due to conservation of spin in transition, it will be excited to the corresponding ms = 0 state in 3E and then go back to original state. However, for a <b>spin</b> <b>state</b> with ms = ±1 in 3A, after the excitation, it has a relatively high probability to jump to the intermediate state 1A by non-radiative transition and go to the ground state with ms = 0. After sufficient cycles, the state of the N-V center can be regarded as in the ms = 0 state. Such a process can be used in the initialization of quantum state in quantum information processing.|$|E
25|$|In both {{hemoglobin}} and myoglobin it {{is sometimes}} incorrectly stated that the oxygenated species contains iron(III).

This change in <b>spin</b> <b>state</b> is a cooperative effect due to the higher crystal field splitting and smaller ionic radius of Fe2+ in the oxyhemoglobin moiety.|$|E

25|$|With {{regard to}} a ligand field and ligand field theory, {{the change in}} <b>spin</b> <b>state</b> is a {{transition}} from a low spin (LS) ground state electron configuration to a high spin (HS) ground state electron configuration of the metal’s d atomic orbitals (AOs), or vice versa. The magnitude of the ligand field splitting along with the pairing energy of the complex determines whether {{it will have a}} LS or HS electron configuration. A LS state occurs because the ligand field splitting (Δ) is greater than the pairing energy of the complex (which is an unfavorable process).|$|E
25|$|Explorer 1 changed {{rotation}} axis after launch. The elongated body of {{the spacecraft}} had been designed to spin about its long (least-inertia) axis but refused to do so, and instead started precessing due to energy dissipation from flexible structural elements. Later it was understood that on general grounds, the body {{ends up in the}} <b>spin</b> <b>state</b> that minimizes the kinetic rotational energy for a fixed angular momentum (this being the maximal-inertia axis). This motivated the first further development of the Eulerian theory of rigid body dynamics after nearly 200 yearsto address this kind of momentum-preserving energy dissipation.|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} {{population}} inversion under these conditions, {{it is necessary}} to selectively remove some atoms or molecules from the system based on differences in properties. For instance, in a hydrogen maser, the well-known 21cm wave transition in atomic hydrogen, where the lone electron flips its <b>spin</b> <b>state</b> from parallel to the nuclear spin to antiparallel, can be used to create a population inversion because the parallel state has a magnetic moment and the antiparallel state does not. A strong inhomogeneous magnetic field will separate out atoms in the higher energy state from a beam of mixed state atoms. The separated population represents a population inversion which can exhibit stimulated emissions.|$|E

We observed spin-relaxation with a magnetic field dependence different from GaAs dots, which can be explained by spin-orbit interaction.

40|$|We {{simulate}} {{the control of}} the <b>spin</b> <b>states</b> in a two-electron double quantum dot when an external detuning potential is used for passing the system through an anticrossing.

25|$|Since {{the source}} of an EPR {{spectrum}} {{is a change in}} an electron's <b>spin</b> <b>state,</b> it might be thought that all EPR spectra for a single electron spin would consist of one line. However, the interaction of an unpaired electron, by way of its magnetic moment, with nearby nuclear spins, results in additional allowed energy states and, in turn, multi-lined spectra. In such cases, the spacing between the EPR spectral lines indicates the degree of interaction between the unpaired electron and the perturbing nuclei. The hyperfine coupling constant of a nucleus {{is directly related to the}} spectral line spacing and, in the simplest cases, is essentially the spacing itself.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic {{splitting}} (hyperfine splitting) is {{a result}} of the interaction between the nucleus and any surrounding magnetic field. A nucleus with spin I splits into 2Inbsp&+nbsp&1 sub-energy levels in the presence of magnetic field. For example, a nucleus with <b>spin</b> <b>state</b> Inbsp&=nbsp&3/2 will split into 4 non-degenerate sub-states with m'I values of +3/2, +1/2, −1/2 and −3/2. Each split is hyperfine, being in the order of 10−7nbsp&eV. The selection rule of magnetic dipoles means that transitions between the excited state and ground state can only occur where m'I changes by 0 or 1. This gives 6 possible transitions for a 3/2 to 1/2 transition. In the majority of cases only 6 peaks can be monitored in a spectrum produced by a hyperfine splitting.|$|E
