5|$|However, {{there is}} another <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in Napoleon himself, {{in the way he}} holds himself. David's Napoleon is flamboyant, {{confident}} in his leadership of the French army, and in his ability to cross the Alps and defeat the Austrians in Italy. Delaroche's Napoleon is instead downcast, gaunt and embittered by the harsh cold. His eyes and expressionless face evidence his weariness, his tiredness a result of the long and unstable trek.|$|E

5|$|The {{first and}} most <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> is in Napoleon, in his clothing, and in his general stature.

Hundred samples were collected from which 60 were from ice cream machines and 40 were from Looli factory in Khartoum State. The results revealed a highly <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> (P 0. 05) in all chemical components due to flavor except total solids. There was non <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> (P> 0. 05) between machines and Looli ice cream with respect to type of flavor in all chemical components except total solids. The microbiological examination showed non <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> (P> 0. 05) in yeast count, coliform and psycrotrophic bacterial counts in both machines and Looli ice cream except total bacterial counts. Yeast count, coliform and psychrotrophic count were highest in Looli samples, while total bacterial count was highest in machine samples. The results indicated highly <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> (P 0. 05) in total bacterial and psychrotrophic counts. The results between machines and Looli factory made by flavor showed non <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> (P> 0. 05) in all microbiological tests except in total bacterial counts. According to results of the panel tests for sensory evaluation, all machines and Looli samples showed highly <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> (P 0. 05). The sensory characteristics of flavor postulated non <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> (P> 0. 05) in all sensory tests except in flavor.
