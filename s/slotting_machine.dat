40|$|When {{entering}} the casino gaming area, gamers {{are faced with}} hundreds of <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> that vary in terms of themes, colours and sounds. Some gaming situations are characterized by low gamer involvement, but with considerable brand differences. Gamers visiting a casino {{have the option to}} play on various types of <b>slot</b> <b>machines.</b> <b>Slot</b> <b>machine</b> games range from single-bar to triple-bar combinations that range in themes and symbols. Some gamers prefer to play on the same <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> game each time they visit the casino; while other gamers often do <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> switching. The hypothesis set for {{this study was to determine}} if any differences exist between male and female <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> gamers regarding the way they perceive theme as a <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> attribute. The sample population identified consists of <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> gamers busy playing at a specific <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> in the gaming area of the casino. Cluster sampling was used in the selection of the six South African casinos. A total of six hundred and thirty structured questionnaires were obtained through personal interviews in the gaming areas of the casinos. The raw data collected were statistically analysed on the SPSS program. The main findings of the research indicated that no significant differences exist between male and female <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> gamers regarding the way they perceive theme as a <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> attribute. The findings of this study could assist the casino management and <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturers in understanding how themes as <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> attributes influence gamers.

5000|$|Slot Variance [...] At {{the heart}} of <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> {{gameplay}} {{is the concept of}} slot variance (or slot volatility) that is fundamental to how a <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> ‘feels’ to play. Slot variance is a measure of risk associated with playing a <b>slot</b> <b>machine.</b> A low variance <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> has regular but smaller wins and a high variance <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> has fewer but bigger wins.|$|R

Vertical shapers are generally {{fitted with a}} rotary table to enable curved surfaces to be machined (same idea as in helical planing). The vertical shaper {{is essentially the same}} thing as a slotter (<b>slotting</b> <b>machine),</b> although technically a distinction can be made if one defines a true vertical shaper as a machine whose slide can be moved from the vertical. A slotter is fixed in the vertical plane ...|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the success}} of his power loom, in 1825 he invented a <b>slotting</b> <b>machine</b> to cut keyways in gears and pulleys to fasten them to their shafts. [...] Previously this was done by hand {{chipping}} and filing. The tool was reciprocated vertically, and by adopting Maudslay's slide rest principle, he made the work table with a universal movement, both straight line and rotary so that the sides of complex pieces could be machined. Later he developed the shaping machine, where the cutting tool was reciprocated horizontally over the work, which could be moved in all directions by means of screw-driven slides. Examples of his machine tools, including the oldest existing metal planer, are in the collections of the National Museum of Science and Industry, London. Roberts also manufactured and sold sets of stocks and dies to his range of pitches, so other engineers could cut threads on nuts and bolts and other machine parts.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a <b>slotting</b> <b>machine.</b> These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{advent of}} {{computer}} technology in bingo has blurred the lines between traditional <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> and bingo <b>slot</b> <b>machines.</b> To the average person, bingo-based <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> are physically indistinguishable from an RNG based <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> typically seen in Atlantic City or Las Vegas.

50|$|The company {{introduced}} the highly efficient Corliss valve gear into the United Kingdom from the United States in about 1864 and was closely identified with it thereafter; William Inglis {{being responsible for}} promoting the high speed Corliss engine. About 1881 Hick, Hargreaves received orders for two Corliss engines of 3000 hp, the largest cotton mill engines in the world. Hargreaves and Inglis trip gear was first applied to a large single cylinder 1800 hp Corliss engine at Eagley Mills near Bolton and the company received a Gold Medal for its products at the 1885 International Inventions Exhibition. Mill gearing was a speciality including large flywheels for rope drives, one example of 128 tons being 32 ft in diameter and groved for 56 ropes. Turbines and hydraulic machinery were also manufactured. Many of the tools were to suit the specialist work, with travelling cranes to take 15 to 40 tons in weight, a large lathe, side planer, <b>slotting</b> <b>machine,</b> pit planer and a tool for turning four 32 ft rope flywheels simultaneously. The workshops also featured an 80ton hydraulic riveting machine. For the ease of shipping and transportation, Soho Iron Works had its own railway system, traversed by sidings of the London North Western Railway (LNWR). Inglis, who lived in Bolton was a neighbour of LNWR's chief mechanical engineer, Francis Webb.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{the public}} and private {{availability}} of <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> is highly regulated by state governments. Many states have established gaming control boards to regulate the possession and use of <b>slot</b> <b>machines.</b> Nevada is the only state that has no significant restrictions against <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> both for public and private use. In New Jersey, <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> are only allowed in hotel casinos operated in Atlantic City. Several states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana and Missouri) allow <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> (as well as any casino-style gambling) only on licensed riverboats or permanently anchored barges. Since Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi has removed the requirement that casinos on the Gulf Coast operate on barges and now allows them on land along the shoreline.

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} to assess the {{influence}} of table games on <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> and total casino revenues. The subjects of the analysis are 24 rierboat casinos in the midwestern states of Illinois, Iowa and Missouri and three racinos in Iowa. A racino is a parimutuel racetrack which also offers <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> gaming to its customers. Two econometric models were developed, one for <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> revenue and one for total (<b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> plus table game) revenue at riverboats and racinos. Of particular interest is the effect on <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> and total revenue of adding table games to the gaming operation. <b>Slot</b> <b>machine</b> revenue was found to increase with the number of <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> and decrease with the number of table games. <b>Slot</b> <b>machine</b> revenue was estimated to decrease by 11. 5 % in the presence of 40 table games, the mean number of table games over the sample. Total win was found to increase with an increase in both <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> and table games. The elasticity of total win with respect to the number of <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> and table games was estimated to be 0. 786 and 0. 219, respectively.

40|$|<b>Slot</b> <b>machine</b> {{games have}} become the most popular form of {{gambling}} worldwide. In Finland, their pervasiveness in public spaces and popularity makes them {{one of the most}} common form of gaming. However, in game studies, gambling games are often regarded as borderline games due to the player’s lack of control. In this thesis I ask whether modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games can be considered as games and if so, what similarities there are between them and contemporary video games. To find out if modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games are in fact games, I compare their features with influential definitions of game and play. After this, I utilize an analysis framework derived from the method of close reading to analyze a popular Finnish video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> game Emma. The comparison between modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games and the various definitions of game and play reveals that modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games fit very well into these definitions, and thus they can be considered as games. This notion enables them to be analyzed with game analysis methods. The analysis showed that modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games feature many elements that are commonly found in traditional video games, such as contextual aesthetics, narratives, interaction, as well as some form of player control via choices. Research regarding <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games as games is scarce despite their many intriguing elements that cross disciplinary borders. Modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games have evolved into a form of complex digital entertainment, which calls for open-minded collaboration of game studies and gambling studies in particular, but many other disciplines as well...|$|R
