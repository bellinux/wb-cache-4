40|$|A study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kinetic {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strahl {{electron velocity}} distribution functions (VDF?s) {{in the solar}} wind is presented. This study focuses on the mechanisms that control and regulate the electron VDF?s and <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strahl electrons in the solar wind; mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Various parameters are investigated such as the strahl-electron density, temperature anisotropy, and electron heat-flux. These parameters are used to investigate <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strahl <b>population.</b> <b>The</b> analysis check for whether the strahl electrons are constrained by some instability (e. g., the whistler or KAW instabilities), or are maintained by other types <b>of</b> processes. <b>The</b> electron heat-flux and temperature anisotropy are determined by modeling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3 D-VDF?s from which <b>the</b> moments properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various <b>populations</b> are obtained. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this study have profound implication on the current hypothesis about <b>the</b> probable formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar wind halo electrons produced from <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strahl <b>population.</b> This hypothesis is strengthened by direct observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strahl electrons being scattered into the core-halo in an isolated event. The observation implies that <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strahl is not a continuous process but occurs in bursts in regions where conditions for wave growth providing the scattering are optimum. Sometimes, observations indicate that the strahl component is anisotropic (Tper/Tpal approx. 2).

40|$|ApJ, in press, 27 pages, 22 figuresWe apply {{detailed}} observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Color-Magnitude Relation (CMR) {{with the}} ACS/HST to study galaxy evolution in eight clusters at z~ 1. The early-type red sequence is well defined and elliptical and lenticular galaxies lie on similar CMRs. We analyze CMR parameters {{as a function}} of redshift, galaxy properties and cluster mass. For bright galaxies (M_B < - 21 mag), <b>the</b> CMR <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elliptical <b>population</b> in cluster cores is smaller than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S 0 <b>population,</b> although <b>the</b> two become similar at faint magnitudes. While the bright S 0 population consistently shows larger scatter than <b>the</b> ellipticals, <b>the</b> <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter increases in the peripheral cluster regions. If we interpret these results as due to age differences, bright elliptical galaxies in cluster cores are on average older than S 0 galaxies and peripheral elliptical galaxies (by about 0. 5 Gyr). CMR zero point, slope, and scatter in the (U-B) _z= 0 rest-frame show no significant evolution out to redshift z~ 1. 3 nor significant dependence on cluster mass. Two of our clusters display CMR zero points that are redder (by ~ 2 sigma) than the average (U-B) _z= 0 of our sample. We also analyze <b>the</b> fraction <b>of</b> morphological early-type and late-type galaxies on the red sequence. We find that, while in <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clusters most (80 % to 90 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CMR <b>population</b> is composed of early-type galaxies, in the highest redshift, low mass cluster <b>of</b> our sample, <b>the</b> CMR late-type/early-type fractions are similar (~ 50 %), with most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late-type <b>population</b> composed <b>of</b> galaxies classified as S 0 /a. This trend is not correlated with the cluster's X-ray luminosity, nor with its velocity dispersion, and could be a real evolution with redshift...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study of kinetic {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strahl electron velocity distribution functions (VDF's) in the solar wind. These are used to investigate the pitch-angle <b>scattering</b> and stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> to interactions with electromagnetic (whistler) fluctuations. The study is based on high time resolution data from the Cluster/PEACE electron spectrometer. Our study focuses on the mechanisms that control and regulate the pitch-angle and stability of strahl electrons in the solar wind; mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Various parameters are investigated such as the electron heat-flux and temperature anisotropy. The goal is to check whether the strahl electrons are constrained by some instability (e. g., the whistler instability), or are maintained by other types <b>of</b> processes. <b>The</b> electron heat-flux and temperature anisotropy are determined by fitting the VDF's to a spectral spherical harmonic model from which the moments are derived directly from the model coefficients...|$|R
