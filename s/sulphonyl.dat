It underwent metabolism to <b>sulphonyl</b> and glucuronyl conjugates and was rapidly excreted mainly via urine. Acute oral and dermal toxicity were low. Diphenylamine can cause severe irritation to the eyes. It {{was not a}} skin irritant, {{and it has not}} been technically feasible to test acute toxicity study by inhalation. Diphenylamine targets the red blood cell system and can cause abnormal erythropoiesis in the spleen, and thus congestion of the spleen, and haemosiderosis.

At clear toxic doses of parent animals reproductive effects were limited to reduced implantation sites in F1 females associated with reduced rat litter size, implicating a possible mutagenic or teratogenic effect.

40|$|The {{reactions}} of <b>sulphonyl</b> halides with olefins have been reviewed, with other processes of producing free <b>sulphonyl</b> radicals. Reactions of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and quinones with free radicals {{have also been}} presented. The decomposition of p -toluene <b>sulphonyl</b> iodide was investigated. The <b>sulphonyl</b> iodide decomposed very slowly when refluxed in carbon tetrachloride for eight hours but {{in the presence of}} metals, e. g. silver and copper powders, the decomposition was achieved in less than three hours. The products of this decomposition were p -toluenesulphonic anhydride and p -tolyl- p -toluenethiosulphonate. Copper salts of p -toluenesulphonic acid seem to be formed. The expected dimer, p -tolyldisulphone could not be isolated. Free radicals were used instead of metals to decide whether the sulphonic anhydride was formed by a homolytic or heterolytic reaction. It was expected that the free radicals would combine with the iodine atoms yielding <b>sulphonyl</b> radicals: TolSO 2 I + R. ⟶ TolSO 2 • + R-I The reaction mixtures were complex but the formation of p -toluenesulphonic anhydride could still be detected. The dimer, p -tolyldisulphone was also isolated but only in 3 - 18 % yield. Azobis-isobutyronitrile and azobis(1 -cyano-l- cyclo hexyl) were used as sources of free radicals. The other products of reaction were of the type R-I, R-R and R'-SO 2 Tol (R = 2 -cyano- 2 -propyl and 1 -cyano-l- cyclo hexyl; R' = 2 -cyano- 2 -propyl). Decomposition of the <b>sulphonyl</b> iodide under u. v. light gave also p -toluenesulphonic anhydride.

Attack by the <b>sulphonyl</b> group concerned exclusively the oxygen atoms of quinones. Di- p toluenesulphonates of 1, 4 -dihydroxybenzenes were obtained. p -Toluenesulphonic anhydride did not react with quinones. The <b>sulphonyl</b> iodide attacked hydroquinone at the nucleus to give a sulphone and not a sulphonate, i. e. The mechanism proposed for the reaction of p -toluene-sulphonyl iodide with quinones was as follows: TolSO 2 I + Cu ⟶ TolSO 2 â¢ + CuI TolSO 2 • + Q ⟶ TolSO 2 -Q• TolSO 2 -Q• + TolS 0 2 ⟶ TolSO 2 -Q-SO 2 Td Quinones of higher redox potential were more reactive towards tolylsulphonyl radicals than quinones of low potential. Shielding of the quinone oxygen atoms by methyl or chlorine groups also reduced the reactivity. Further indications of the free radical nature of the {{reactions of}} p -toluene <b>sulphonyl</b> iodide were obtained by reactions with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. In the presence of copper bronze the <b>sulphonyl</b> iodide reacted with anthracene to give 9, 10 -di- p -tolylsulphonyl- 9, 10 -dihydroanthracene. In the absence of metal, 9 - p -tolylsulphonylanthracene was also formed. 2, 3 -Benzanthracene gave 9, 10 -di- p -tolylsulphonyl- 9, 10 -dihydro- 2, 3 -benzanthracene. 1, 2 -Benzanthracene, phenanthrene did not react. Evidence for free radical reactions were obtained with 9, 10 -di-methylanthracene and 9 -methylanthracene. Substitution products of the methyl group were obtained in both cases, which indicated the presence of species able to abstract hydrogen from the side chain. The reaction with cumene gave no bicumyl but p p -tolyl-sulphonyloxy radicals, TolSO 2 - 0 •, have been produced. The mechanism proposed to the reaction of p -toluenesulphonyl iodide with anthracene was as follows: 9 -Methyl- and 9, 10 -dimethylanthracene reacted as follows: The effect of light and inhibitors (hydroquinone) on the addition of p -toluenesulphonyl iodide to acrylonitrile was studied. The reaction was accelerated by light and retarded by hydroquinone and darkness. The production of sulphinyl radicals by reaction of sulphinyl chlorides, Arâ¢SOâ¢Cl with copper bronze was investigated. No evidence for the formation of sulphinyl radicals was obtained since no reaction occurred with olefins, p -benzoquinone or anthracene. Sulphinyl radicals produced by decomposition of 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphenyl nitrate failed to react with p -benzoquinone. </p...|$|E

The kinetics of the interactions between trifluoroacetic anhydride and the sulphonic acids (methane sulphonic and mesitylene sulphonic acid) have been studied and these results used to propose a mechanism for the trifluoroacetic anhydride 'catalysed' formation of sulphones in the reaction of p-toluene sulphonic acid with aromatic hydrocarbons in nitromethane. This mechanism involves the formation of an intermediate (p-toluene <b>sulphonyl</b> trifluoroacetate) which ionises into p-toluene sulphonylium and trifluoroacetate ions. Electrophilic attack by the sulphonylium ions on the aromatic hydrocarbon results in the formation of sulphones. Symmetrical diaryl sulphones {{have been prepared}} from the reaction of sulphuric acid with aromatic hydrocarbons using trifluoroacetic anhydride. The major isomers were isolated and identified. Unsymmetrical diaryl sulphones have also been prepared by a similar method by the sequential addition of two different aromatic hydrocarbons to solutions of trifluoroacetic anhydride and sulphuric acid in nitromethane. The isomeric products formed in both these reactions were separated by g. l. c. The interactions of trifluoroacetic anhydride and sulphuric acid in various mixtures of dichloro-methane and nitromethane were studied and the results again utilised to propose the mechanisms for the reactions ofsulphuric acid with aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of trifluoroacetic anhydride.

Cyclopropane carboxaldehyde p-toluene <b>sulphonyl</b> hydrazone itself gives rise mainly to cyclobutene. The direction of ring opening has been determined from a study of asymmetrically substituted cyclopropyl carbenes, The substitution pattern in the product cyclobutenes indicated that the least substituted bond of the cyclopropane ring was migrating preferentially during the rearrangement.

A series of chalcones 4 a–o were prepared from 3 and substituted aromatic acetophenone. Chalcones 4 a–o further react with guanidine nitrate {{to give a}} series of pyrimidines 5 a–o which condense with 3, 4 -dichlorobenzylchloride to give amide derivatives 6 a–o. Newly synthesized compounds have been examined {{on the basis of}} spectral analysis. All the compounds were screened against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Most of these compounds showed better inhibitory activity in comparison with the standard drugs...|$|E
