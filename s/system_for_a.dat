5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-established}} writing system for ASL, written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing <b>system</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sign language {{seems to be that}} of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} in Shanghai flooded 84city streets; in some locations insufficient {{water drainage}} left homes and apartments flooded, {{with a total}} of 20,000houses reporting flooding. The flooding also closed the city subway <b>system</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few hours. Strong winds downed 2,700 trees and 400 power lines in the city. The typhoon damaged a construction site in the city, leaving three injured and one person killed. Throughout the city an estimated 15,000houses were destroyed. Additionally, four people were electrocuted {{as a result of the}} flooding. In Shanghai alone, damage totaled $1.33billion (2005CNY, $164.5million 2005USD); seven people died in the city.|$|E

5|$|In 1928 China adopted GR as the nation's {{official}} romanization system. GR {{was used}} to indicate pronunciations in dictionaries of the National (Mandarin-based) Language. Its proponents hoped one day to establish it as a writing <b>system</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reformed Chinese script. But despite support from {{a small number of}} trained linguists in China and overseas, GR met with public indifference and even hostility due to its complexity. Another obstacle preventing its widespread adoption was its narrow basis on the Beijing dialect, in a period lacking a strong centralized government to enforce its use. Eventually GR lost ground to Pinyin and other later romanization systems. However, its influence is still evident, as several of the principles introduced by its creators have been used in romanization systems that followed it. Its pattern of tone spelling was retained in the standard spelling of the Chinese province of Shaanxi (shǎnxī, 陝西), which cannot be distinguished from Shanxi (shānxī, 山西) when written in pinyin without diacritics.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the draft}} order had been issued, {{the locus of}} the process moved from the Potteries to London with the Local Government Provisional Order (No. 3) Bill {{introduced}} in the House of Commons in July 1908 by the Select Committee on Private bills chaired by Sir George White. The bill received its third reading on 31 July 1908 but had undergone significant amendment during its passage through the House of Commons, most notably in {{the introduction of a}} complex, differential rating <b>system</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> period of 10 years. Few of the interested parties were pleased with the proposal and, although the differential system was welcomed, a period of 20 years was preferred with the complicated valuation required of all public assets proving unpopular. As a result, Tunstall withdrew its support for the order leaving only Hanley and Longton to promote the bill in the House of Lords. Neither council was particularly in favour of the financial settlement but felt honour bound to promote the bill, having been the initial instigators of the scheme. Petitions objecting to the bill were submitted to the House of Lords by Staffordshire County Council, Burslem, Fenton, Stoke, and Tunstall councils, the Longton Justices, the North Staffordshire Railway Company, and individual Tunstall ratepayers.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords Select Committee {{assigned}} {{to deal with}} the bill was chaired by Lord Cromer and sat during November and December 1908. After several sessions, the committee declared several important decisions. It reaffirmed that federation would benefit {{of the people of the}} Potteries, that a differential rating <b>system</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fixed period was required, that asset valuation in each town should be abandoned, and that the committee reserved the right to decide a course of action should the parties not be able to reach agreement. This last point was important because without it all disputes would have to be passed back either to the Local Government Board or the House of Commons. With prorogation of the current Parliament on the horizon, this would have led to delays that jeopardised the passage of the whole bill through Parliament during that parliamentary session.|$|E
