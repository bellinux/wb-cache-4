5|$|Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell {{will usually}} pursue most creatures that it encounters. This {{includes}} the <b>skunk,</b> and the breed {{is prone to}} <b>skunk</b> toxic shock syndrome. The chemical in the <b>skunk</b> spray is absorbed by the dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.|$|E

5|$|If countershading paints out shadows, the reverse, darkening {{the belly}} and {{lightening}} the back, would maximise contrast by {{adding to the}} natural fall of light. This pattern of animal coloration is found in animals like the <b>skunk</b> and honey badger with strong defences—the offensive stink of the <b>skunk,</b> and the sharp claws, aggressive nature and stink of the honey badger. These animals do not run when under attack, but move slowly, often turning to face the danger, and giving deimatic or threat displays either to startle inexperienced predators, or as an aposematic signal, to warn off experienced ones.|$|E
50|$|The {{secretion}} of {{the spotted}} <b>skunks</b> {{differs from that}} of the striped <b>skunks.</b> The two major thiols of the striped <b>skunks,</b> (E)-2-butene-1-thiol and 3-methyl-1-butanethiol are the major components in the secretion of the spotted <b>skunks</b> along with a third thiol, 2-phenylethanethiol.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of rabies cases {{reported to the}} Centers for Disease Control each year occur in wildlife including <b>skunks,</b> raccoons, bats, foxes, and coyotes. Currently, oral rabies vaccination campaigns are employed to immunize coyotes, foxes, and raccoons. Though <b>skunks</b> are vectors of 6 rabies strains, there is currently no effective oral vaccine or delivery system for <b>skunks.</b> More information {{is needed to determine}} if baits currently used are sufficiently attractive to <b>skunks,</b> or if the baits are difficult for <b>skunks</b> to handle and consume. We observed bait manipulation by <b>skunks</b> in penned/feeding trials to determine the bait type most conducive to ingestion and delivery of a mock vaccine to <b>skunks.</b> Smaller baits were easier for <b>skunks</b> to manipulate and consume, and vaccine containers coated with bait facilitated sachet puncture and increased the potential for vaccine delivery. Our information will be useful in the development of baits and vaccine containers for large-scale rabies vaccination campaigns that target <b>skunks...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{spray of}} <b>skunks</b> {{consists}} mainly of low-molecular-weight thiols and derivatives. These have a foul odor that protects <b>skunks</b> from predators such as humans and wolves. Owls can prey on <b>skunks</b> {{as they are}} unable to smell the thiols.|$|R
5|$|Other {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made with the civet, sewage, stale vomit, <b>skunk</b> spray and used surgical swabs.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{molecular}} systematic DNA {{research also}} places the red panda {{into its own}} family, Ailuridae, {{a part of the}} broad superfamily Musteloidea that also includes the <b>skunk,</b> raccoon, and weasel families.|$|E
5|$|Cory's wife Vicki {{was given}} {{the role of a}} <b>skunk</b> reporter, and while some {{consideration}} was initially given to having an adult play the child woodpecker Quill, the role was instead given to producer David K. Lovegren's daughter Kathryn.|$|E
50|$|Recent genetic {{research}} {{was done on}} Channel Island <b>skunks</b> to determine genetic variation in <b>skunks</b> between islands. Morphologically <b>skunks</b> on both islands {{do not seem to}} vary whatsoever, {{with the exception of the}} <b>skunks</b> on Santa Rosa Island being slightly longer than those on Santa Cruz Island. The study found that genetic variation between the two island species was not consistent with the morphological variation and was much greater than that of the mainland species. This conclusion leads researchers to hypothesize that spotted <b>skunks</b> were brought to the islands by either rafting or intentionally by Native Americans. The genetic variation between mainland <b>skunks</b> and those on the islands are enough to cause researchers to propose that the taxonomic classification of the <b>skunks</b> as S. g. amphiala, should be reconsidered and that each island population be considered a separate subspecies or even a new species separate from the mainland one.|$|R
50|$|Polish law {{considers}} <b>skunks</b> {{as normal}} pets, like as cats and dogs. There aren't any specific regulations {{and there is}} no requirement to register <b>skunks.</b> There are a few breeders from whom <b>skunks</b> are available. Prices are vary from around €150 to €400, (600-1600 Polish zloty).|$|R
50|$|Spotted <b>skunks</b> {{can live}} 10 years in captivity, {{but in the}} wild, about half the <b>skunks</b> die after 1 or 2 years.|$|R
5|$|More {{than ten}} species of mammals have been {{observed}} in the park, several of them endangered, including the colocolo, the Andean mountain cat, the spectacled bear, the taruca deer, the vicuña, the white-tailed deer, the puma, the northern viscacha, the long-tailed weasel, the hog-nosed <b>skunk</b> and the Andean fox.|$|E
5|$|A hemlock-mixed {{hardwood}} palustrine {{forest is}} present in the vicinity of Scotch Run east of the reservoir on the stream. The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools. Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak, red oak, tulip poplar, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, American beech, and red maple. Other plants in the forest include teaberry, sphagnum moss, wood anemone, false hellebore, <b>skunk</b> cabbage, goldthread, and sensitive fern.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are taken}} {{by a number of}} mammals, {{including}} American mink, striped <b>skunk,</b> otters, foxes and racoons, with the latter being responsible for nearly 40% of all nest failures. Birds such as herring gulls, northern ravens and American crows will eat unattended eggs. Because their nests are at the water's edge, common loon eggs are especially vulnerable if the adult is absent.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} animals reside within the preserve. Among them are hooded <b>skunks,</b> spotted <b>skunks,</b> hog-nosed <b>skunks,</b> stink badgers, coyotes, mule deer, javelina, raccoons, Gila monsters, ringtails, rock squirrels, spiny lizards leopard frogs, Clark’s spiny lizard, ornate tree lizard, Gilbert’s skink, ring-necked snake, western diamondback rattlesnake, gray fox, bobcats, and {{mountain}} lions.|$|R
40|$|Many mammals use heterothermy to meet {{challenges}} of reduced food availability and low temperatures, but {{little is known}} about the prevalence of heterothermy in wild mesocarnivores. We monitored body temperature (Tb) in free-living striped <b>skunks</b> (Mephitis mephitis) through winter 2015 – 2016 in suburban Flagstaff, Arizona, a high-elevation site that experiences temperate winters. Subcutaneous Tb and heterothermy index (HI) were significantly affected by ambient temperature, and varied significantly across 7 <b>skunks</b> in midwinter. Twenty-one of 36 (58 %) unique diurnal dens used by <b>skunks</b> were associated with human structures, and although females were found in dens under houses more than expected compared to males, we found little evidence that <b>skunks</b> selected dens where they could access anthropogenic heat sources. This is the 1 st study to document Tb variation over winter in free-living striped <b>skunks.</b> Our results are consistent with 2 previous studies of captive <b>skunks</b> in documenting considerable variation among individuals in the extent of heterothermy. If reduced Tb during heterothermy alters rate of viral replication, variation among individual <b>skunks</b> could have implications for the maintenance and spread of diseases like rabies...|$|R
50|$|<b>Skunks</b> are {{reluctant}} to use this weapon, as they carry just enough of the chemical {{for five or six}} uses - about 15 cc - and require some ten days to produce another supply. Their bold black and white coloration makes their appearance memorable. It is to a <b>skunk's</b> advantage to warn possible predators off without expending scent: black and white aposematic warning coloration aside, threatened <b>skunks</b> will go through an elaborate routine of hisses, foot-stamping, and tail-high deimatic or threat postures before resorting to spraying. <b>Skunks</b> usually do not spray other <b>skunks,</b> except among males in the mating season. If they fight over den space in autumn, they do so with teeth and claws.|$|R
5|$|Five {{species of}} shrubs {{grow in the}} {{vicinity}} of Mahoning Creek, its floodplain, and the nearby slopes: smooth alder, silky dogwood, gray dogwood, spicebush, and American elderberry. 11 herb species also grow in this location. These include <b>skunk</b> cabbage, bloodroot, sensitive fern, sedge, wood anemone, woolgrass, and others. There are also invasive plants such as multiflora rose, Japanese knotweed, and garlic mustard in the area.|$|E
5|$|Omnivorous mammals such as {{the raccoon}} and <b>skunk</b> and {{herbivore}} mammal species {{such as the}} porcupine and pika, are common to the forest. The beaver is considered a species of special interest to Shoshone National Forest since its dam building activities improve habitat for numerous other species such as the moose, breeding waterfowl, various amphibians and other species dependent on a riparian environment.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed Senior Prom was a {{classified}} black program {{conducted by the}} United States Air Force {{in conjunction with the}} Lockheed Corporation's <b>Skunk</b> Works for the development and testing of a cruise missile using stealth technology. Based on the company's Have Blue demonstrator, the six Senior Prom vehicles proved successful in testing conducted at Area 51 in the late 1970s; despite this, the aircraft was not selected to enter production, and the program was terminated in the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The genus Spilogale {{includes}} all <b>skunks</b> {{commonly known as}} spotted <b>skunks</b> and is composed of four different species: S. gracilis, S. putorius, S. pygmaea, S. angustifrons.|$|R
5000|$|During his Guggenheim Reading from 1963, Lowell {{notes that}} there have been {{conflicting}} interpretations of the final image of <b>skunks</b> in the poem. He states that [...] "Richard Wilbur said that <b>skunks</b> were delightful creatures[...] [...] and John Berryman wrote[...] [...]the <b>skunks</b> were utterly terrifying, catatonic creatures." [...] Lowell concludes that [...] "both interpretations could be right." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Skunks</b> are {{probably}} {{best known for}} their ability to spray foul-smelling fluid as a defense against predators. Most wild <b>skunks</b> spray only when injured or attacked, as a defense mechanism. The mercaptan-emitting scent glands are usually removed in pet <b>skunks</b> at about four weeks of age. Since 2006, this removal practice has been illegal in the UK.|$|R
5|$|The {{film was}} panned by critics {{and did not}} make its budget back at the box office. Murphy {{then went on to}} reprise his role as the Scarecrow {{for the third time in}} The Dark Knight Rises, and had a {{supporting}} role as Mike, the favourite teacher of the main character <b>Skunk,</b> in the British independent film Broken. His performance earned him a British Independent Film Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} {{is the only}} living species of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae. It has been {{previously}} placed in the raccoon and bear families, but the results of phylogenetic analysis provide strong support for its taxonomic classification in its own family, Ailuridae, {{which is part of}} the superfamily Musteloidea along with the weasel, raccoon and <b>skunk</b> families. Two subspecies are recognized. It is not closely related to the giant panda, which is a basal ursid.|$|E
5|$|A {{multiplayer}} mini-game {{is included}} and allows two players to compete via the DS' wireless connection, only one player needs an Over the Hedge game cartridge for two separate DS consoles to play. Stella the <b>skunk</b> {{is available in}} this game mode, alongside the three playable characters from the main game. Players navigate a maze to collect food before the timer runs out. The player with the most food wins the game. A most of five pieces of food can be carried at once, these must be carried to a collection area before more food can be picked up.|$|E
50|$|Many countries, such as Japan, {{require all}} newly {{imported}} <b>skunks</b> to be quarantined. In 2003, The Guardian {{reported that the}} UK lacks quarantine kennels licensed to hold <b>skunks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Veterinary {{understanding}} of <b>skunks</b> is rather limited, since scientists have not conducted as much research on <b>skunks</b> {{as they have}} on more common pets. <b>Skunks</b> do not always respond to medicines {{the same way as}} cats or dogs. As a result, there is considerable disagreement about how best to treat them. Some veterinarians say they are related to hamsters and treat them as such. However, hamsters are from the Rodent order while <b>Skunks</b> are in the family Mephitidae of the order Carnivora. This is the same order as cats, dogs, and ferrets.|$|R
50|$|In the U.S., {{there is}} {{currently}} no USDA-approved vaccine for the strain of rabies that afflicts <b>skunks.</b> When cases are reported of pet <b>skunks</b> biting a human, the animals are frequently killed {{in order to be}} tested for rabies. It has been reported that three different variants of rabies exist in striped <b>skunks</b> in the north and south central states.|$|R
5|$|Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, {{habitats}} {{are dominated}} by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, Douglas fir, and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon live oak. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of <b>skunk,</b> cougar, spotted owl, and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies have}} an odour {{described}} variously as resembling garlic, radish, lemon, onion, or <b>skunk,</b> and taste like radish. Although some older sources report P.squarrosa as edible, the mushroom has caused several cases of poisoning. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with the mushroom, then experienced vomiting and diarrhoea about ten hours later. The toxic effect {{may be due}} to the combination of eating the mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended time delay between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity is different than the antabuse-effect experienced from Coprinopsis atramentaria with alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Most {{land around}} the oxbow is steep. It {{is covered by}} hemlock and {{hardwood}} forests, as well as <b>skunk</b> cabbage seeps. The forests around the lake also contain black birch, yellow birch, white oak, red oak, sugar maple, tulip poplar, and Norway maple, while the understory contains slippery elm, European privet, Japanese barberry, American elderberry, wild hydrangea, witch hazel, mountain laurel, ironwood, and the rare American yew. The American yew population was in significant decline by 2004 due to heavy grazing by deer.|$|E
50|$|Most predators of the Americas, such as wolves, foxes and badgers, seldom attack <b>skunks,</b> presumably {{out of fear}} {{of being}} sprayed. The {{exceptions}} are reckless predators whose attacks fail once they are sprayed, dogs, and the great horned owl, which is the <b>skunk's</b> only regular predator. In one case, the remains of 57 striped <b>skunks</b> were found in a single owl nest.|$|R
5000|$|Thioacetate {{derivatives}} of {{the three}} thiols {{are present in the}} spray of the striped <b>skunks</b> but not the spotted <b>skunks.</b> They are not as odoriferous as the thiols. Water hydrolysis converts them to the more potent thiols. This chemical conversion may be why pets that have been sprayed by <b>skunks</b> will have a faint [...] "skunky" [...] odor on damp evenings.|$|R
40|$|Striped <b>skunks</b> (Mephitis mephitis) were inoculated with street {{rabies virus}} and {{immunosuppressed}} with several doses of cyclophosphamide. Control <b>skunks</b> were inoculated with street virus only. The <b>skunks</b> {{were killed in}} terminal stages {{of the disease and}} several tissues were collected for examination by immunofluorescence, light microscopy and viral titration. Sera collected at euthanasia from most of the principals did not contain detectable rabies neutralizing antibodies, whereas high titers occurred terminally in controls. Immunofluorescence was much more entensive in submandibular salivary glands of cyclophosphamide-treated than control <b>skunks.</b> Similarly, virus was isolated from this tissue more consistently and at higher titer from principals than from controls. Immunofluorescence was extensive in brains of all <b>skunks</b> (both groups), but virus was isolated consistently only from brains of cyclophosphamide-treated <b>skunks.</b> Most of the cyclophosphamide-treated <b>skunks</b> had very few inflammatory cells in brain and cerebrospinal ganglia. Neuronal degeneration occurred in dorsal root ganglia of both principals and controls. The results suggest that the immune response has no effect on the development of rabies-induced aggressive behavior, that the immune response may inhibit salivary gland infection and that it is not essential for the development of neuronal degeneration in dorsal root ganglia...|$|R
