40|$|Investigating {{the reasons}} that people give for {{unhealthy}} snacking behavior is important for developing effective health interventions. Little research, however, has identified reasons that apply to a large audience and most studies do not integrate multiple factors, precluding any conclusions regarding their relative importance. The present study explored reasons for unhealthy snacking among a representative community sample. Participants (. N= 1544) filled out the newly developed Reasons to Snack inventory assessing an elaborate range of motives at baseline and 1 -month follow-up. Exploratory and replication factor analyses identified six categories: opportunity induced eating, coping with negative emotions, enjoying a <b>special</b> <b>occasion,</b> rewarding oneself, social pressure, and gaining energy. The highest mean scores were obtained for enjoying a <b>special</b> <b>occasion</b> and opportunity induced eating. Regression analyses with participant characteristics as independent variables and each category of reasons as dependent variables showed differences for age. For all reasons except to enjoy a <b>special</b> <b>occasion,</b> younger people reported a higher score. Women indicated a higher score than men on coping with negative emotions, enjoying a <b>special</b> <b>occasion</b> and gaining energy. People who diet to a stronger extent reported a higher score for snacking because of social pressure, to reward oneself and to cope with negative emotions, with the latter also being related to a higher BMI. Finally, a higher education was associated with enjoying a <b>special</b> <b>occasion.</b> Future health interventions could allocate more attention to diminishing unhealthy snacking {{with regard to the}} six identified categories, specifically focusing on enjoying a <b>special</b> <b>occasion</b> and opportunity induced eating...|$|R
