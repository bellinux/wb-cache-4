40|$|International audienceLow-frequency Passive Integrated Transponders (LF-PIT tags) {{have been}} {{increasingly}} used to track bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers. Prior {{studies have reported}} high recovery rates in small streams. Recovery rates remained much lower in large systems, in large parts because of the limited reading distance of the tags (< 1 m), the problem of signal interference due to tags in close proximity (“clustering”), and potentially the particle abrasion during transport and subsequent PIT tag destruction. Experiments have been performed to assess controlling factors for detection ranges, develop new tracking techniques {{to go beyond the}} constraint of tracer clustering using High-Frequency Passive Integrated Transponders (HF-PIT tags) inserted in synthetic particles, and evaluate the resistance of natural and synthetic tracer particles. We tested different equipment (two types of PIT tags, three types of antennas) within different environments. We worked {{for the first time with}} real fluvial constraints, i. e., the gravel deposits and the aquatic channel. The three-dimensional detection envelopes were quantified as well as the effect of practices (inter-operator bias, battery power) on the detection. Best reading distances were measured along the (x, y 0, z 0) axis (antenna plane) with tag orientation a = 90 °, reaching respectively 64, 91, and 127 cm with the small, medium, and large antenna. The influence of burial in dry and water-saturated sediment, and the influence of water immersion were shown to be minor: whatever statistically differences were detected between environments, the size of these differences was only between - 4. 0 and + 3. 5 cm regarding median values of reading distances. We also tested the resistance of tracers during transport in an annular flume. We designed <b>synthetic</b> particles using <b>corundum</b> (density ~ 2. 2) equipped with both passive (LF) and active (HF) tags. Transport distances of synthetic particles were found to be close to natural limestone particles used as a reference. Particle densities and forms slightly influenced tracer mobility. We showed that synthetic pebbles were more resistant to fragmentation than limestone, but less resistant to abrasion. LF-equipped limestone in the b-axis was also more sensitive to fragmentation than unequipped limestone. 10 % of HF devices were damaged during the experiment whereas only 2 % of LF ones were. Finally we summarized practical implications for RFID bedload tracking through in situ and ex situ experiments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{stochastic}} {{nature of}} grinding predetermines {{the necessity of}} attracting statistical methods to predict output parameters. In this research the form accuracy indices of flat workpieces EFEmax (the main parameter) and two additional indices EFEa and EFEq called the arithmetic average and the quadratic average, respectively are used (GOST 24642 - 81). In the conditions of violating normality and homoscedasticity of distributions {{the selection of the}} grain in the Norton high porous wheels (HPW) made of <b>synthetic</b> <b>corundum</b> 5 SG (46, 60) K 12 VXP is made with an emphasis on a non-parametric method, wherein medians and quartile latitudes are used as one-dimensional frequency distributions. This paper states that grinding by the coarse-grained HPW 5 SG 46 in comparison with the small-grained 5 SG 60 made it possible to increase the form accuracy by the predicted medians within the same accuracy quality class: for EFEmax – TFE 7; for EFEa and EFEq – TFE 6. The precision of the form accuracy of the parts 30 ChGSA increased most significantly: for EFEmax it increased by 5 times, for EFEa by 3. 1 times, and for EFEq by 4. 2 times. The fact that the heights of microasperity remained practically at the same level [] 11. 0; 1. 0 ∈•aR, µm; [] 72. 0; 7. 0 max ∈•R, µm was due to the features of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>corundum</b> grain structure. In this study the EFEmax parameter is used for selecting the wheel grain. The auxiliary parameters of form accuracy are used in calculating the correction indexes of basic models in the multivariate dispersion analysis because they have more information about the status of the part surface...|$|E

The chemical compositions based on the XPS survey scans were in good agreement with the expected composition. High resolution A 12 p scans showed no significant changes in binding energy, with all values between 73. 9 and 74. 4 eV. Only bayerite showed two transitions, associated {{with the presence of}} amorphous material in the sample. More information about the chemical and crystallographic environment was obtained from the 0 Is high resolution spectra. Here a clear distinction could be made between oxygen in the crystal structure, hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water. Oxygen in the crystal structure was characterised by a binding energy of about 530. 6 eV in all minerals. Hydroxyl groups, present either in the crystal structure or on the surface, exhibited binding energies around 531. 9 eV, while water on the surface showed binding energies around 533. 0 eV. A distinction could be made between boehmite and pseudoboehmite based on the slightly lower ratio of oxygen to hydroxyl groups and water in pseudoboehmite. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|In gem testing routine, one of {{the main}} {{requirements}} is to obtain the maximum amount of information without sample preparation. Even the classical gemological methods allow usually identifying the mineralogical identity of a gem, the possibility to inspect aspects as provenance of natural gemstone, and invasive and blind treatments often require the application of more sophisticated methods able to give back quantitative information [1]. Moreover, due to the development of more and more refined synthesis method, the discrimination between natural and synthetic gems is not trivial. Among gemstone analysis techniques, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is increasingly worth considering; the method, already tested for example in origin determination of emeralds [2] or detection of Be-diffusion treatment in corundum [3], provides rapid results on trace-element contents, the latter considered a fingerprint of a gem. Moreover, determining a minimal damaging (an ablation area of just few micrometers), it can be extensively used on both cut and raw gemstones. In this prospective, the present paper intends to contribute the researches in gems analytics providing the results of LIBS measurements on a meaningful sampling of natural (both cut and raw specimens) and synthetic rubies and sapphires, highlighting the potential of the method in helping gemological laboratories for the fast, easy, micro-destructive and reliable discrimination between natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>corundum,</b> as well as provenance determination...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} solid state NMR {{experiments}} {{on a variety}} of minerals and glasses are described with the aim of studying the dependence of their structure on the chemical composition. Chapter 1 introduces the reader to the subject. Chapter 2 describes 23 Na and 27 Al NMR experiments on a number of alkali fluoroaluminates. These substances consist of AIF 6 octahedra which can be linked together to form a variety of structures, similar {{to the way in which}} Si 04 and AI 04 tetrahedra are linked together in aluminosilicates. The 23 Na and 27 Al chemical shifts correlate well with the type of structure. AIF 3 is a network structure and has the most negative 27 Al chemical shift (- 16 ppm). The chemical shift increases from - 3 and - 1 ppm in the sheet structure chiolite (NasAI 3 F 14) to 0 ppm in cryolite (N AIF 6) ' The 23 Na chemical shift is dependent of the number of fluorines coordinating Na: Na in an NaF 6 group has a more positive chemical shift than Na in NaFs. Additionally, 27 Al chemical shifts for oxides are shown to be at least 20 ppm less shielded than those in similar fluorides. Chapter 3 studies pentameric (Si,Al) s 016 groups with (almost) straight intertetrahedral AI-O-Si angles in a zunyite with excess Al and in harkerite. The excess Al in the zunyite lattice is shown to occupy the central tetrahedral Si(l) site. The 27 Al chemical shift correlation with the AI-O-Si angle is extended to 1760 Chapter 4 reports the first application of off-resonance nutation spectroscopy to five alkali aluminosilicate glasses. These glasses have a chemical composition similar to that of a granite, with the alkali's replaced by Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs. Off-resonance nutation spectroscopy, newly developed at the HF-NMR facility in Nijmegen, proves to be very powerful in determining the quadrupole interaction and subsequently the isotropic chemical shifts for Al in these glasses. The quadrupole interaction and the chemical shift decrease when the size of the charge-balancing counterion increases. The correlation of the 27 Al chemical shift with the AI-O-Si angle for framework aluminosilicate structures (see also chapter 3) is used to show, that the size of the alkali ion determines the size of the rings building up the glasses. Since the quadrupole interaction for Al is linearly correlated with the polarising power of the alkali ion, the aluminium and the alkali ions are believed to be closely bound. This is supported by a theoretical ionic model predicting this correlation. Chapter 5 investigates the use of corundum (a-AI 20 3) as a standard in quantatative NMR measurements. As AI is a quadrupolar nucleus, a number of requirements have to be fullfilled in order to obtain reliable results. Most importantly, only the central transition is excited by using a very short rf pulse in order to be in the region of linear response. The intensities of five natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>corundum</b> samples are compared. Despite the fact that all experimental conditions are identical and in the linear region, the intensities differ considerably. A <b>synthetic</b> <b>corundum</b> obtained by heating Al(OH) 3 has the highest intensity, close to the expected value, but the other samples have much too low intensities. Relaxation effects are shown to be responsible for this. It is proposed, that only in case of a wellcharacterized corundum sample without impurities a-A 120 3 can be used as a standard for quantitative NMR measurements...|$|E
