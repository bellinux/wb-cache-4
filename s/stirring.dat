Towards the end of 1998, with the political situation in Indonesia increasingly unstable and Sarumpaet rumoured to be wanted for <b>stirring</b> up dissent, she fled to Europe via Singapore. In December 1998, the Tokyo-based Asia Foundation for Human Rights awarded Sarumpaet the Female Human Rights Special Award.|$|E

Warren demanded an immediate halt to the entire cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|E

5|$|In sport, an iron puddler, Robert Chambers of the company's Walker works, won the {{sculling}} {{championship at}} the 1857 Thames Regatta.

Chambers also won the return match, held on the Tyne on 19 April 1859, even after a collision with a moored boat left him a hundred yards behind.|$|E
5|$|Parkman also {{believed}} that Pontiac's War had been secretly instigated by French colonists who were <b>stirring</b> up the Native Americans {{in order to make}} trouble for the British. This belief was widely held by British officials at the time, but subsequent historians have found no evidence of official French involvement in the uprising. (The rumor of French instigation arose in part because French war belts from the Seven Years' War were still in circulation in some Native villages.) Rather than the French <b>stirring</b> up the Native Americans, some historians now argue that the Native Americans were trying to stir up the French. Pontiac and other native leaders frequently spoke of the imminent return of French power and the revival of the Franco-Native alliance; Pontiac even flew a French flag in his village. All of this was apparently intended to inspire the French to rejoin the struggle against the British. Although some French colonists and traders supported the uprising, the war was initiated and conducted by Native Americans who had Native—not French—objectives.|$|E
5|$|Super Bowl XXV {{took place}} amidst a {{background}} of war and patriotism in front of 73,813 fans at Tampa Stadium, in Tampa, Florida. The Persian Gulf War had begun {{less than two weeks}} previous and the nation rallied around the Super Bowl as a symbol of America. Adding to the patriotism was Whitney Houston's <b>stirring</b> rendition of the National Anthem, which became {{known as one of the}} greatest renditions in Super Bowl history. The game lived up to the <b>stirring</b> Anthem, as it went down as the most competitive Super Bowl in history. The Giants got off to a quick 3–0 lead. However, the Bills scored the next 12 points, on a field goal, a touchdown by backup running back Don Smith, and a safety after Jeff Hostetler was sacked in the end zone by Bruce Smith, to give the Bills a 12–3 lead. The Giants then ran a drive that took almost 8 minutes, and culminated in a 14-yard touchdown pass from Hostetler to Stephen Baker making the score 12–10 at halftime.|$|E

5|$|Dušan's {{death was}} {{followed}} by the <b>stirring</b> of separatist activity in the Serbian Empire. The south-western territories, including Epirus, Thessaly, and lands in southern Albania, seceded by 1357. However, the core of the state (the western lands, including Zeta and Travunia with the upper Drina Valley; the central Serbian lands; and Macedonia), remained loyal to Emperor Uroš. Nevertheless, local noblemen asserted more and more independence from Uroš' authority even in the part of the state that remained Serbian. Uroš was weak and unable to counteract these separatist tendencies, becoming an inferior power in his own domain. Serbian lords also fought each other for territory and influence.|$|E

5|$|Priestley's {{attempts}} to avoid political {{controversy in the}} United States failed. In 1794, the journalist William Cobbett published Observations on the Emigration of Dr. Joseph Priestley, which falsely accused Priestley of <b>stirring</b> up rebellion in Britain, and attempted to undermine his scientific credibility. His political fortunes took an even worse turn when Cobbett obtained a set of letters sent to Priestley by the radical printer John Hurford Stone and the liberal novelist Helen Maria Williams. Cobbett published the letters in his newspaper, asserting that Priestley {{and his friends were}} fomenting a revolution. Priestley was eventually forced to defend himself in print.|$|E
5|$|This set {{the pattern}} for the six-year {{conflict}} between the Ottomans and Venice over control of Thessalonica. While the Ottomans blockaded and attacked Thessalonica from land, trying to starve it into surrender, the Republic sent repeated embassies to secure recognition of her possession of Thessalonica in exchange for an annual tribute. To back up their diplomatic efforts, the Venetians tried {{to put pressure on}} the Sultan, by <b>stirring</b> up trouble along the Ottomans' periphery, sponsoring efforts for an anti-Ottoman Crusade, and sending their fleet to attack Gallipoli. The Ottomans likewise tried to distract Venice by launching raids of their own on Venetian possessions in the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to defeat}} Agesilaus' army, Pharnabazus decided to force Agesilaus to {{withdraw}} by <b>stirring</b> up {{trouble on the}} Greek mainland.

Timocrates visited Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, and succeeded in persuading powerful factions {{in each of those}} states to pursue an anti-Spartan policy. The Thebans, who had previously demonstrated their antipathy towards Sparta, undertook to bring about a war.|$|E

5|$|When the General Assembly {{convened in}} June 1564, an {{argument}} broke out between Knox and Maitland over {{the authority of}} the civil government. Maitland told Knox to refrain from <b>stirring</b> up emotions over Mary's insistence on having mass celebrated and he quoted from Martin Luther and John Calvin about obedience to earthly rulers. Knox retorted that the Bible notes that Israel was punished when it followed an unfaithful king and that the Continental reformers were refuting arguments made by the Anabaptists who rejected all forms of government. The debate revealed his waning influence on political events as the nobility continued to support Mary.|$|E
5|$|Andrew III of Hungary {{made his}} {{maternal}} uncle, Alberto Morosini, Duke of Slavonia, in July 1299, <b>stirring</b> up the Slavonian and Croatian noblemen to revolt. A powerful Croatian baron, Paul Šubić, sent his brother, George, to Italy in early 1300 to convince Charles II of Naples {{to send his}} grandson to Hungary to claim the throne in person. The king of Naples accepted the proposal and borrowed 1,300 ounces of gold from Florentine bankers to finance Charles's journey. A Neapolitan knight of French origin, Philip Drugeth, accompanied the twelve-year-old Charles to Hungary. They landed at Split in Dalmatia in August 1300. From Split, Paul Šubić escorted him to Zagreb where Ugrin Csák swore loyalty to Charles. Charles's opponent, AndrewIII of Hungary, died on 14January 1301. Charles hurried to Esztergom where the Archbishop-elect, Gregory Bicskei, crowned him with a provisional crown before 13May. However, most Hungarians considered Charles's coronation unlawful because customary law required {{that it should have}} been performed with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár.|$|E

Buckner, although protesting this distraction from the military mission, attended as well and gave <b>stirring</b> speeches to the local crowds about the Confederacy's commitment to the state of Kentucky. The inauguration ceremony was disrupted by the sound of cannon fire from an approaching Union division and the inaugural ball scheduled for that evening was canceled.|$|E

5|$|If pure {{platinum}} {{is found}} in placer deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is paramagnetic, whereas nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic. These two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be removed by <b>stirring</b> the mixture in {{either of the two}} acids and recovering the remaining platinum.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, Krakatoa begins <b>stirring</b> for {{the first}} time in 200 years. In the nearby village of Waringin, Sadidjah confides to her husband, village head Tjakra Amidjaja, that she has had a bad dream about the volcano; she fears that it will be the death of them. Tjakra Amidjaja {{consoles}} her, and tells her that they will leave the village in two days. In the meantime, the volcano grows increasingly violent and Tjakra Amidjaja and Sadidjah stay behind to manage the evacuation. They send their children, Hasan and Soerijati, to stay with family in Rangkas Gombong. Krakatoa erupts several hours later. The village is wiped out in the resulting tsunami, and Soerijati is lost after she falls out of the carriage she is in; Hasan, however, arrives safely in Rangkas Gombong.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, 800 protesters {{embarked}} on a protest march from Trinidad to La Paz, on the way facing violent conflict from police and those who supported the road, with many being injured. The controversy caused two government officials and various other high-ranking officials to resign in protest, while Morales begged forgiveness but blamed the U.S. and Bolivia's right-wing for <b>stirring</b> up the unrest. In October 2011, he passed Law 180, prohibiting further road construction, although the government proceeded with a consultation, eventually gaining the consent of 55 of the 65 communities in TIPNIS to allow the highway to be built, albeit {{with a variety of}} concessions; construction was scheduled to take place after the 2014 general election. In May 2013, the government then announced that it would permit hydrocarbon exploration in the nation's 22 national parks, to widespread condemnation from environmentalists.|$|E
