40|$|Severe {{immunosuppression}} is {{an established}} {{risk factor for}} non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but an association with <b>subclinical</b> <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> is unclear. We conducted a case-control study nested in the Physicians' Health Study and the Nurses' Health Study cohorts to determine whether patterns of antibody response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were associated with NHL risk. We measured antibody titers against viral capsid antigen, early antigen, and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA- 1 and EBNA- 2) in blood samples collected before diagnosis from 340 cases and 662 matched controls. Using conditional logistic regression, we estimated rate ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for elevated versus normal titers and the ratio of anti–EBNA- 1 to anti–EBNA- 2 titers (≤ 1. 0 vs > 1. 0). We found no association between EBV serostatus, elevated titers, or an EBNA- 1 /EBNA- 2 ratio ≤ 1. 0 and NHL risk overall. For chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, suggestive associations were noted for elevated anti–EBNA- 2 (RR, 1. 74; 95 % CI, 0. 99 - 3. 05), anti–viral capsid antigen (RR, 1. 58; 95 % CI, 0. 79 - 3. 14), and EBNA- 1 /EBNA- 2 ratio ≤ 1. 0 (RR, 1. 52; 95 % CI, 0. 91 - 2. 55).

40|$|Innate and {{adaptive}} <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> {{also referred to}} as cirrhosis-associated <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> syndrome, is a major component of cirrhosis, and plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of both the acute and chronic worsening of liver function. During the evolution of the disease, acute decompensation events associated with organ failure(s), so-called acute-on chronic liver failure, and chronic decompensation with progression of liver fibrosis and also development of disease specific complications, comprise distinct clinical entities with different immunopathology mechanisms. Enhanced bacterial translocation associated with systemic endotoxemia and increased occurrence of systemic bacterial infections have substantial impacts on both clinical situations. Acute and chronic exposure to bacteria and/or their products, however, can result in variable clinical consequences. The immune status of patients is not constant during the illness; consequently, alterations of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory processes result in very different dynamic courses. In this review we give a detailed overview of acquired <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and its consequences for cirrhosis. We demonstrate the substantial influence of inherited innate <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> on acute and chronic inflammatory processes in cirrhosis caused by the pre-existing acquired <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> with limited compensatory mechanisms.

Type-II IFN (IFN-γ) -induced signaling was reduced in B cells from all 3 cancer patient groups, but not in T cells or natural killer cells. Impaired-IFN signaling was equally evident in stage II, III, and IV breast cancer patients, and downstream functional defects in T cell activation were identified.

40|$|Cardiomyopathies {{are often}} {{initiated}} by diastolic dysfunction, {{and treatment of}} diastolic dysfunction remains empirical {{with an emphasis on}} prevention. This dissertation focuses on the mechanism of cardiomyopathy and diastolic dysfunction during aging and <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> The governing hypothesis is that altered cytokine release such as that seen during aging and <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> can lead to diastolic dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis. Our first study examined the role of aging and immunosenescence on the cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) and left ventricular stiffness. We demonstrated age-related <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> myocardial fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction. We also found that exogenous dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an adrenal steroid hormone popular due to its anti-aging effects, partially reversed these pathologies in aged mice. In this model, fibrosis and its reversal were associated with altered regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and collagen cross-linking. We propose two mechanisms for the protective effects of DHEA: (1) a direct effect on cardiac fibroblasts, or (2) downstream effects of immune modulation. In the subsequent study, we found that DHEA is capable of directly altering cardiac fibroblasts, suggesting a mechanism for the effects of DHEA on cardiac function. Due to pleiotropic effects of DHEA, we decided to specifically target the immune system using T-cell receptor peptides during murine AIDS(mAIDS). Mice with mAIDS suffer from cardiomyopathy in the absence of myocarditis and opportunistic pathogens. We demonstrated that reversal of <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in mAIDS was associated with reversal of myocardial fibrosis and ventricular stiffness. In conclusion, we have demonstrated age- and immune-related diastolic dysfunction that can be reversed by modulation of the T-cells of the immune system. Immune modulation should be further investigated as a therapeutic target to treat diastolic <b>dysfunction</b> during <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> We also found that MMPs and collagen cross-linking are highly involved in extracellular matrix regulation in the models used in this dissertation...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe term cirrhosis-associated <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> {{refers to}} the main syndromic {{abnormalities}} of immune function, immunodeficiency and systemic inflammation that are present in cirrhosis. The course of advanced cirrhosis, regardless of its aetiology, is complicated by cirrhosis-associated <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and this constitutes the pathophysiological hallmark of an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, distinctive of the disease. Cirrhosis impairs the homeostatic role of the liver in the systemic immune response. Damage to the reticulo-endothelial system compromises the immune surveillance function of the organ and the reduced hepatic synthesis of proteins, involved in innate immunity and pattern recognition, hinders the bactericidal ability of phagocytic cells. Systemic inflammation, in form of activated circulating immune cells and increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, {{is the result of}} persistent episodic activation of circulating immune cells from damage-associated molecular patterns, released from necrotic liver cells and, as cirrhosis progresses, from pathogen-associated molecular patterns, released from the leaky gut. Cirrhosis-associated <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> phenotypes switch from predominantly “pro-inflammatory” to predominantly “immunodeficient” in patients with stable ascitic cirrhosis and in patients with severely decompensated cirrhosis and extra-hepatic organ failure (e. g. acute-on-chronic liver failure), respectively. These cirrhosis-associated <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> phenotypes represent the extremes of a spectrum of reversible dynamic events that take place during the course of cirrhosis. Systemic inflammation can affect the functions of tissue somatic cells and modify the clinical manifestation of cirrhosis. The best characterized example is the contribution of systemic inflammation to the haemodynamic derangement of cirrhosis, which correlates negatively with prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Acute liver failure (ALF) shares {{striking}} similarities with {{septic shock}} {{with regard to}} the features of systemic inflammation, progression to multiple organ dysfunction and functional immunoparesis.

This review explores the evolution of the systemic inflammation in acute liver failure, its relation to disease progression, exacerbation of liver injury and development of innate <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and extra-hepatic organ failure as sequelae. Defects in innate immunity are described in hepatic and extra-hepatic compartments. Clinical studies measuring levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and expression of the antigen presentation molecule HLA-DR on monocytes, in combination with ex-vivo experiments, demonstrate that the persistence of a compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome, leading to functional monocyte deactivation, is a central event in the evolution of systemic <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> Accurate <b>immune</b> profiling in ALF may permit the development of immunomodulatory strategies in order to improve outcome in this condition...|$|R

The overall objective {{of this study is}} to determine effect of Murine AIDS (MAIDS), its cofactors and aging on opportunistic infection, and the potential of immunomodulation roles of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEAS) on ameliorating the immunological abnormality caused by retrovirus infection and aging. DHEA(S) was previously shown to have immune enhancing properties during (MAIDS) and the aging. DHEA(S) significantly increased T-cell proliferation, restored secretion of Th 1 cytokines production, and normalized secretion of Th 2 cytokine. Survival was significantly increased in the 29 -month-old mice treated by DHEA. DHEAS plus antioxidants significantly normalized immune function, as well as maintained hepatic vitamin E levels nearer control. In addition, DHEAS supplementation increased resistance to cryptosporidiosis in aged mice. Our study suggests that DHEA(S) alone and especially DHEAS plus antioxidant nutrients can prevent <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in aging as well as aging, retrovirus infected mice. Chronic ethanol (EtOH) consumption causes <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and further exacerbates <b>immune</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and cytokine imbalance during MAIDS. DHEAS supplementation during MAIDS with EtOH consumption partially restored immune function, prevented the further dysregulation of cytokines and hepatic lipid peroxidation, and maintained hepatic vitamin E levels to near normal levels.
