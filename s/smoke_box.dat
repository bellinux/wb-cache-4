5|$|After {{commissioning}} {{too late}} {{to participate in the}} First World War, Argus was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from Furious. The first landing on the ship was made on 1 October 1918 by a Sopwith Ship Strutter. The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a <b>smoke</b> <b>box</b> to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and Sopwith Pups. Argus was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered , which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush {{with the rest of the}} flight deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. Argus joined the Atlantic Fleet in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four Sopwith Camel fighters, two Airco DH.9A bombers and two Fairey floatplanes. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown over the side of the carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.|$|E
25|$|The PRR had {{a design}} style that it favored in its locomotives. One example was the square-shouldered Belpaire firebox. This British-style firebox was a PRR {{trademark}} that was rarely used by other locomotive builders in the U. S. PRR also used track pans extensively to retrieve {{water for the}} locomotive while in motion. Using this system meant that the tenders of their locomotives had a comparatively large proportion of coal (which could not be taken on board while running) compared to water capacity. Locomotives of the PRR had a clean look to them. Only necessary devices were used and they were mounted neatly on the locomotive. <b>Smoke</b> <b>box</b> fronts bore a round locomotive number board denoting a freight locomotive or a keystone number board denoting a passenger locomotive. Otherwise the <b>smoke</b> <b>box</b> was uncluttered except for a headlamp {{at the top and}} a steam-driven turbo-generator behind it. In later years the positions of the two were reversed, since the generator needs more maintenance than the lamp.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his early}} career, Fowler {{had worked with}} steam engines and the logical {{progression}} was to apply this method of power to his drainage plough. This he did in 1852 when he designed a steam engine with a winch mounted {{out in front of}} the <b>smoke</b> <b>box</b> and a rope running from it, round a pulley anchored at the far side of the field and back to the engine. The engine pulled itself across the field, dragging the mole plough behind it. The design was therefore similar to his first design for the horse-powered plough. The experiment was a failure because the steam engine proved to be too heavy to move easily over soft ground. However, in the same year, on 21 October, Fowler was awarded patent number 480 for [...] "Improvements in Machinery for draining land", believed to be one of the first patents for the use of steam power in agriculture.|$|E

2500|$|The Mason Bogie was still, though, {{plagued by}} one of the biggest {{problems}} of the Fairlie - the jointed steam pipes to the driven truck leaked far too much steam. Mason eventually changed to a different scheme, in which the pivot point for the leading truck became a hollow ball joint through which the live steam for the cylinders passed. [...] Mason also developed a sliding seal for the exhaust from the moving cylinder saddle into the <b>smoke</b> <b>box.</b> Although better, Mason's improvements took up much valuable space in between the driving wheels, forcing Mason to use an outside valve gear, generally the Walschaerts valve gear. Additionally, the reversing shaft had to be mounted atop the boiler, with a long lifting link dropping down to the radius rod, a feature unique to Mason Bogies (this was necessary because the lifting link would swing to the side as the truck pivoted, lifting the radius rod and changing the valve setting. [...] Lengthening the link, and thus increasing the radius of its swing, minimized the amount of change.).|$|E

5000|$|As {{built the}} {{locomotives}} would have carried the lined dark olive green livery of the Great Southern & Western Railway until around {{the start of}} the 20th Century. After that, they were black with red lining until the late 1910s, when they were painted all over unlined grey. This dull but all-encompassing livery included motion, wheels, inside frames, cabs, <b>smoke</b> <b>boxes</b> and chimneys. The only relieving feature was the red buffer beam. Standard cast number plates were also painted over grey, with rim and numerals picked out in cream or very pale grey, or occasionally not at all. This livery persisted post-1925 into Great Southern Railways days, and was extended to locomotives of other constituent companies after the GSR amalgamation of that date. On the formation of CIÉ in 1945, the only change was that the cast number plates were gradually removed and pale yellow numerals were painted on instead.

The current study was designed to investigate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 8, MMP- 9, MMP- 12, tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP) - 1, and TIMP- 4 in rat lung tissues in response to CSE, and assessed the effect of simvastatin in regulating expression of MMPs and TIMPs. Methods: Thirty normal Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were divided into control (n= 10), CSE (n= 10), and CSE plus simvastatin (n= 10) groups. Animals were whole-body exposed to the cigarette <b>smoke</b> in the <b>box</b> for 1 hour each time, twice a day, 5 days a week for 16 weeks. Animals of CSE + simvastatin group were intra-gastrically administered simvastatin at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day followed by CSE. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was harvested for inflammatory cell count and lung tissues were stained for morphologic examination. Expression of mRNA and protein level of MMP- 8, MMP- 9, MMP- 12, TIMP- 1, and TIMP- 4 was assessed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results: CSE resulted in a significant increase of mean linear intercept (MLI: 34. 6 ± 2. 0 µm) and bronchial wall thickness and diameter (BWT/D, 0. 250 ± 0. 062) compared to control (MLI: 24. 0 ± 1. 7 µm, BWT/D: 0. 160 ± 0. 034, P 0. 01). Simvastatin slightly but not significantly prevented alteration of MLI, BWT/D, and mean alveolar number (MLI: 33. 4 ± 1. 4 µm; BWT/D: 0. 220 ± 0. 052; mean alveolar number: 15. 5 ± 2. 5 N/µm 2, P> 0. 05). Total white blood cell was significantly increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of smoking group (3. 3 ± 2. 5 × 109 cells/L vs 1. 1 ± 1. 3 × 109 cells/L of control, P 0. 05). In response to CSE, MMP- 8, MMP- 9, and MMP- 12 mRNA were upregulated more than sevenfold, while TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 4 increased two- to fivefold. Simvastatin significantly blocked upregulation of MMP- 8 and - 9 (P 0. 05). In addition, simvastatin significantly blocked cigarette smoke-induced MMP- 8 and - 9 protein synthesis, while it had no significant effect on TIMP- 1 and - 4 protein synthesis even in the presence of cigarette smoke. Conclusion: CSE resulted in imbalance of MMPs and TIMPs, and by which mechanism, cigarette smoke may lead to insufficient lung tissue repair. Simvastatin partially blocked airway inflammation and MMP production and, thus, statins may modulate composition of the lung extracellular matrix.
