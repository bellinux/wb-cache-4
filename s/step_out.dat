5|$|In March 2016 Laurence Fox apologised for {{swearing}} at {{a member}} of the audience who had been muttering audibly in the front row during a performance of The Patriotic Traitor at London's Park Theatre on 8 March. The audience saw Fox <b>step</b> <b>out</b> of character - that of French statesman Charles de Gaulle - and chastise the heckler with robust language.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} stories Laureline {{generally}} {{sits in the}} background while Valérian saves the day in whatever situation the pair have found themselves, but her position changes as the series develops. World Without Stars, {{in which the two}} characters are separated for most of the adventure, allows Laureline to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> from under Valérian's shadow for the first time, and she proves to be more than an equal to Valérian in ensuring that their mission succeeds.|$|E

After {{watching}} Capaldi's message, Ross Goodall stated that his son's behaviour patterns changed markedly. This change included the ability to comfort his sister and <b>step</b> <b>out</b> of his day-to-day routine. Ross Goodall said that after watching the video, his son smiled {{for the first time since}} his grandmother's death. The family framed the letter from Capaldi that came before the video message, and Ross Goodall said that Thomas looked at it when he felt distressed.|$|E

50|$|There was {{anticipation}} that <b>Stepping</b> <b>Out</b> would re-establish Minnelli's film career. Originally <b>Stepping</b> <b>Out</b> was to {{be released}} in the spring of 1991 to coincide with her New York concert stage show Live from Radio City Music Hall, but because of a corporate restructuring at Paramount Pictures, the film's opening was delayed until the fall of 1991. Nonetheless, <b>Stepping</b> <b>Out</b> received quite a bit of publicity with Minnelli being interviewed on both Donahue and The Joan Rivers Show as well as appearing with the cast of <b>Stepping</b> <b>Out</b> (minus Ellen Greene and Julie Walters) on the The Sally Jessy Raphael Show to promote the film. When it was released on October 4, 1991, <b>Stepping</b> <b>Out</b> garnered decent reviews but only grossed $246,000 total in the United States and then went straight to video.|$|R

5|$|Mulder {{performs}} {{further research}} on the adoption records and uncovers information on a third sister (Perkins), who is apparently troubled and homeless. With Starkey's help, Mulder canvases abandoned buildings in a desolate part of town. However, the Dark Figure finds and kills the girl. After finding Father Gregory at the scene, Mulder believes that {{he is responsible for}} the murders. Under questioning by Mulder and Scully, Father Gregory insists that he tried to protect the girls' souls from the Devil, and that the fourth girl must be located. While the agents <b>step</b> <b>out</b> of the interrogation room, Starkey enters and demands to know the location of the fourth girl. When Gregory does not answer, he is burned alive by Starkey, who is revealed to be the Devil.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the wind. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> and take a double-sided ladder to reset the sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|E

25|$|On Andrea Doria, the {{decision}} to abandon ship was made within 30minutes of impact. A sufficient number of lifeboats {{for all of the}} passengers and crew were positioned {{on each side of the}} Boat Deck.

25|$|Following this, at the NHK Trophy, Hanyu scored 103.89 in {{the short}} program after landing the quadruple Salchow-triple toe combination, triple Axel and a quadruple loop, albeit with a <b>step</b> <b>out.</b> The Olympic {{champion}} led by almost 16 points over Nathan Chen. In his free skating to “Hope and Legacy” by Joe Hisaishi, Hanyu nailed three quadruple jumps: loop, Salchow and a toe loop and only missed the second quad Salchow. He broke the three-hundred barrier again, with 301.47 for first place.|$|E

However the final shot shows, not an astronaut boot, but Gene Hunt's signature white loafer taking the first step onto the martian surface, casting doubt once again onto the ending.|$|E
25|$|The entire losing team {{remains in}} the {{boardroom}} and are confronted with their loss. They are interrogated as to {{the reasons for their}} loss and which players contributed to it or failed at the task. Then, for the final stage of the boardroom meeting, the project manager is asked to select a certain number of teammates (typically two, but on occasion one or three) to bring back into the final-stage boardroom meeting. The remaining teammates return to the suite while the project manager and the selected teammates <b>step</b> <b>out</b> of the boardroom momentarily so the host can consult with his advisors.|$|E

On 2 July 1998, Giles {{made his}} Test debut against South Africa, and took 1 for 106 in 36 overs. He {{then went on}} to tour Australia in the One Day squad. On 31 December, it was {{announced}} that Giles was to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> of the One Day match between the ODI squad and the Bradman XI, and into the Test squad for the final Test match in Sydney. He was chosen in light of Australia's selection of Shane Warne, Colin Miller and Stuart MacGill, England captain Alec Stewart stating that the selection of Giles gave England another option.|$|E
25|$|In early 2016, it was {{announced}} that British boxer Amir Khan was moving up two weight divisions to middleweight, to fight Álvarez for his lineal, Ring and WBC world middleweight championship titles. The fight took place on 7 May 2016, at the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The bout was on HBO PPV. Khan kept his distance in the first 5 rounds, using his speed to come in and <b>step</b> <b>out</b> which initially caused trouble for Canelo. In round 6, Canelo landed a devastating right hand that knocked out Khan. The fight generated a live gate of $7,417,350, according to figures released by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. That total came from 13,072 tickets sold, far short of a sellout. The Álvarez-Khan gross places it 34th-best in Nevada history.|$|E
25|$|Veteran Mark Martin, {{coming off}} his final year with Roush Racing, was signed drive {{the car for}} 23 races (21 points races plus the Budweiser Shootout and Nextel All-Star Challenge) in 2007, with Joe Nemechek moving over to the team's new 13 team. Regan Smith was pinned to fill the {{remaining}} 16 races of the season, while driving in the Busch Series for the team as well. The team also {{changed its name to}} Ginn Racing to reflect Bobby Ginn's new majority interest in the team. Martin was leading in the final turn of the season-opening Daytona 500, after lining up on the final restart with former Roush teammates Greg Biffle and Matt Kenseth behind him. Coming down the front stretch, and with the field wrecking behind him, Martin looked to have finally come through at Daytona. But the caution was not called, and Kevin Harvick caught Martin on his outside, beating him to the line by two-hundredths of a second. Martin put together more strong finishes, and after the fourth race at Atlanta was leading the points standings in {{what was supposed to be}} his first season of semi-retirement. Resisting the chance to capture his first championship, Martin did <b>step</b> <b>out</b> of the car as scheduled, breaking a streak of 621 consecutive starts. In 24 starts for the team, Martin scored 11 top 10s, and finished 27th in points despite missing 12 races.|$|E
