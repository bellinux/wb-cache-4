In 1912, the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mission</b> St-Jean Baptiste de Falher was opened 5 km from the current location of the Town of Falher. When the railway came to the area in 1915, the settlement was named after Father Constant Falher, a Roman Catholic Oblate missionary {{who was born in}} Josselin, Brittany, France in 1863, arriving at Grouard in 1889. The origin of the majority of local colonizers were from Quebec; some arriving in the area via the United States of America (French American), such as Robert Goulet's family, who settled in the nearby Village of Girouxville.

40|$|The Stanley Mission Old Village site (GiNd- 11) {{is located}} in {{northern}} Saskatchewan along the Churchill River. The mission settlement, established in 1851, was situated {{on the north shore}} of the river and consisted of several buildings, including Holy Trinity Anglican Church, the parsonage, the schoolhouse, numerous Cree cabins, and the Revillon Frères complex. Previous investigations at the site, both surface surveys and excavations, yielded many artifacts and a Cree cabin foundation. The modern-day <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> Stanley <b>Mission</b> is now positioned {{on the south side of}} the Churchill River, but the history of the community remains rooted at its original location. The only surviving features there are Holy Trinity Church and the cemetery. This thesis focuses on the archaeological data collected from the 2006 and 2007 field seasons during which a Cree cabin was excavated revealing building remains and producing thousands of artifacts. The historical research in this thesis draws upon the information gathered from the oral history interview sessions with local Elders conducted in 2001 and 2006. As well, other sources such as trader and missionary journals, archival photographs, and historic maps were consulted to establish a more holistic and complete history <b>of</b> the <b>mission</b> presenting the views of both local Cree people and Europeans. The information acquired from all lines of evidence was integrated to gain a better understanding of life at Stanley Mission during the later 1800 s through to the 1970 s. This included daily activities within the community, items purchased at the trading posts, the organization and layout of the Cree cabins, cabin construction, and a specific emphasis on one cabin once thought to be owned by Murdoch McKenzie. After a thorough examination it has been determined that the cabin in question is older than previously thought and likely was one of the first cabins built at the mission...|$|R

The site of the Misión Vieja (or [...] "Old Mission") is located near the intersection of San Gabriel Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue. In 1776, a flash flood destroyed much of the crops and ruined the Mission complex, which was subsequently relocated five miles closer to the mountains in present-day San Gabriel (the native <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> Iisanchanga).
