Due to the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> length of the episode, several scenes had to be cut or trimmed for time, since so much was being placed in the episode. A review by Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club was complimentary towards the story, and Sava also applauded Dunham's voice-acting.|$|E
5|$|Although The Raft of the Medusa retains {{elements}} of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> its dramatic presentation, it represents {{a break from the}} calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's influence {{can be seen in the}} works of Eugène Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and Édouard Manet.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the above}} {{mentioned}} awards and unanimous critical approval, The Wire {{never won a}} single Primetime Emmy Award nor received any major nominations, except for two writing nominations in 2005 and 2008.

5|$|Stone Rollin expands on the {{traditional}} soul music style of his 2008 album The Way I See It, with exploring rhythm and blues, rock, funk, and blues styles. A widespread critical success and deemed by some reviewers as Saadiq's best work, the record was noted for its stylistic breadth, groove-based compositions, varied <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>and</b> incorporation of the Mellotron keyboard. It also became Saadiq's highest-charting album in the United States, reaching number 14 on the Billboard 200. He supported the album with a concert tour spanning from March to August 2011.|$|E
5|$|The album's lyrical {{themes are}} dark, {{focusing}} on global tensions and political happenings during 2014. The {{rise of the}} Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, {{media coverage of the}} 2015 general election in the United Kingdom, and various mass shootings influenced its writing. The band's musical sound was composed to provide contradiction to the violent <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>and</b> is inspired by artists such as Radiohead, Suicide, and Kendrick Lamar.

5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{has been}} used as a backdrop in commercial films, notably in the 2006 Hollywood film The Break-Up, which had to reshoot several scenes because the sculpture was under cover for the initial filming. It is also prominently featured in the ending scene of Source Code. Director Duncan Jones felt the structure was a metaphor for the movie's <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> aimed for it to be shown at the beginning and end of the movie. The sculpture served as an aesthetic and symbolic setting for the 2012 film The Vow when the lead characters share a kiss under it.|$|E
5|$|The {{unblemished}} musculature of {{the central}} figure waving to the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E
5|$|Tohari's second novel, Kubah {{was written}} in two months {{and based on the}} events {{surrounding}} the Communist Party and the 30September Movement coup in 1965. Published in 1980 by Pustaka Jaya, Kubah came at a time when literary works with similar themes– the victimisation of Communist Party members– were scarce. The novel has also been characterised as dawah (Islamic preaching). Reception of Kubah was mostly mixed; critics praised the novel for its <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> criticised it for its predictability. It received a literary award in 1981, and in 1986 it was translated into Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Grindcore is {{an extreme}} genre of music that {{originated}} {{in the early to}} mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> black humor.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the lack}} of {{information}} about homosexuality in scholarly texts, another forum for learning about lesbianism was growing. A paperback book titled Women's Barracks describing a woman's experiences in the Free French Forces was published in 1950. It told of a lesbian relationship the author had witnessed. After 4.5 million copies were sold, it was consequently named in the House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials in 1952. Its publisher, Gold Medal Books, followed with the novel Spring Fire in 1952, which sold 1.5 million copies. Gold Medal Books was overwhelmed with mail from women writing about the <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>and</b> followed with more books, creating the genre of lesbian pulp fiction.|$|E
5|$|By 2004, Blink-182, {{consisting}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, had {{emerged as the}} biggest pop punk act of the era, releasing the seven-times-multiplatinum Enema of the State (1999) and number one album Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). The band took a brief break in 2002 when DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back, during which time he collected several darker musical ideas he felt unsuitable for Blink-182, compiling them into a record, Box Car Racer. The album, recorded {{with the help of}} Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy, was intended as a one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit. The side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed. The moody <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> music on Box Car Racer edged its way into the Blink sound as well, and the band explored experimentalist elements on their next effort, an eponymous fifth studio album (2003). Geffen Records, after the success of Box Car Racer, offered DeLonge a solo recording deal, which he declined, feeling that it would cast a negative shadow over the band. Nevertheless, the possible deal loomed over the band, contributing to internal tension.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore the {{relationship}} between mathematics teachers’ <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> knowledge <b>and</b> their teaching effectiveness. A convenient sample of 19 grade 11 mathematics teachers and 418 students were initially selected for the study and took part in some stages of the study. Of this lot, only 11 teachers and 246 students participated in all the stages of the study. Explanatory Mixed methods research design which entails the use of a co-relational study and a descriptive survey design were employed in the study. Data was collected from the teachers using a self report questionnaire, Teacher <b>Subject</b> <b>Matter</b> Knowledge of Trigonometric Functions Scale (TSMKTFS) and peer evaluation questionnaire, and from students using teacher evaluation questionnaire and Student Trigonometric Functions Performance Scale (STFPS). All the instruments had their validity and reliability accordingly determined. Quantitative data gathered was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics while qualitative data gathered from teachers’ and students’ tests were analysed using task performance analysis. It was found that a positive, statistically significant relationship existed between teachers’ <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> knowledge <b>and</b> the composite measure of their teaching effectiveness. The relationships between teachers’ <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> knowledge <b>and</b> students’ achievement and also between teachers’ <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> knowledge <b>and</b> students’ rating of the teachers’ teaching effectiveness were found to be positive and statistically significant. However, the relationships between teachers’ <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> knowledge <b>and</b> teachers’ self rating as well as teachers’ <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> knowledge <b>and</b> peers’ rating of teachers’ teaching effectiveness were not found to be statistically significant though they were positive. Further data analysis showed that there was a difference between the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> knowledge of effective and ineffective teachers and also between the students taught by effective teachers and the students taught by the ineffective teachers.

5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>and</b> not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E
5|$|Maury Gertsman, {{who handled}} the {{cinematography}} for nearly all Universal Pictures films from the mid-1940s to mid-1950s, worked as director of photography on The Brute Man. Since the film focused on a disfigured serial killer, Gertsman sought to give the movie a dark, diseased look appropriate for the film's <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> urban setting. Although primarily a horror thriller film, Gertsman uses several film noir elements in his photography, including shadowed lighting, unbalanced compositions, and chiaroscuro contrasts between light and dark. As a result, The Brute Man features a bleak, at times dismal visual atmosphere. Hans J. Salter, who composed the scores {{for many of the}} Universal Pictures films of the 1940s and 1950s, worked as composer for The Brute Man as well. Salter's score for the film strongly resembled the music he composed for the Universal horror films Black Friday (1940) and The Invisible Man's Revenge (1944). Philip Cahn edited The Brute Man. Raymond Kessler and Ralph Slosser worked as dialogue director and assistant director, respectively, while John B. Goodman and Abraham Grossman worked as art directors. Other crew included Russell A. Gausman and Edward R. Robinson as set decorators, Joe Lapis as sound technician, Jack Pierce as make-up director, Carmen Dirigo as hair stylist, and Vera West as gowns supervisor.|$|E
5|$|Viking metal {{features}} the Vikings as its <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> for evocative imagery. The Vikings were Northern European seafarers and adventurers who, during the Middle Ages, relied on sailing vessels such as longships, knerrir, and karvi to explore, raid, pirate, trade, and settle along the North Atlantic, Baltic, Mediterranean, Black Sea, and Caspian coasts and Eastern European river systems. The Viking Age is generally cited as beginning in 793, when a Viking raid struck Lindisfarne, and concluding in 1066, {{with the death}} of Harald Hardrada and the Norman conquest of England. During this two-hundred-year period, the Vikings ventured west as far as Ireland and Iceland in the North Atlantic and Greenland and what is now Newfoundland in North America, south as far as the Kingdom of Nekor (Morocco), Italy, Sicily, and Constantinople in the Mediterranean, and southeast as far as what are now Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine in Eastern Europe, Georgia in the Caucasus, and Baghdad in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|Wing {{panels and}} other {{fragments}} of Lochner's larger works are today spread across various museums and collections. Two surviving double-sided wing panels from an altarpiece {{with images of}} saints are in the London's National Gallery and the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne (this now sawn through so both sides can be displayed on a wall). The wings of the Last Judgement originally had six parts, painted on both sides, but have been sawn into twelve individual pictures, now divided between the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, the Alte Pinakothek in Munich and the Städel Museum in Frankfurt. It is probably from early in his career, but in <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> background differs from other extant and attributed works. While the elements are arranged in typical harmony, the composition and tone are unusually dark and dramatic. The Crucifixion is also an early work and reminiscent of late medieval painting.
