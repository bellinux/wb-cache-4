5|$|After the British {{invasion}} of 1806, Santiago de Liniers successfully reconquered Buenos Aires. The population {{did not allow}} Rafael de Sobremonte to continue as Viceroy. He had escaped to Cordoba with the public treasury while the battle was still in progress. A law enacted in 1778 required the treasury to be moved to a <b>safe</b> <b>location</b> {{in the case of}} a foreign attack, but Sobremonte was still seen as a coward by the population. The Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires did not allow his return to Buenos Aires and elected Liniers, acclaimed as a popular hero, as an interim Viceroy. This was an unprecedented action, the first time that a Spanish viceroy was deposed by local government institutions, and not by the King of Spain himself; King CharlesIV ratified the appointment at a later time. Liniers armed the entire population of Buenos Aires, including criollos and slaves, and defeated a second British invasion attempt in 1807.|$|E

Schools closed ahead of the storm, and the ferry between the island and Saint Martin was halted and moved to a <b>safe</b> <b>location.</b> In Saint Kitts and Nevis, the National Emergency Management Agency was activated on November16. Officials there advised residents living near ghauts to evacuate, and one shelter was located in each district of the country. In addition, stores were open for longer hours to allow people to stock up on supplies. Most businesses and schools were closed in Antigua and Barbuda during the storm, while in Dominica, the airport was closed. Further south, there was little warning for the hurricane in Grenada, and most people left their boats in the water.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Bynars discreetly {{create a}} catastrophic {{failure in the}} ship's warp core. Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) and Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) are unable to locate Picard or Riker and, {{assuming}} them to already be on the Starbase, order an emergency evacuation. They set the ship to leave the Starbase and warp to a <b>safe</b> <b>location</b> before it would explode. However, once they are clear of the dock, the failure disappears and the ship sets course for the Bynar system, the planet Bynaus orbiting Beta Magellan. Data, La Forge, and Quinteros realize that the Bynars are still aboard the ship, but there are currently no other working vessels to follow them. Back on the Enterprise, Riker and Picard leave the simulation to find the ship empty and at warp to the Bynar system, with the ship's controls locked to the bridge. Fearing that the Bynars have taken over the ship for nefarious purposes, they set the ship to self-destruct in 5 minutes and then take the bridge by inter-ship transporter beam and find the Bynars there unconscious.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, when Winchester was {{no longer}} a <b>safe</b> <b>location</b> for the storage of Hampshire County's records and they again risked {{destruction}} by Union Army forces, White's son Captain Christian Streit White took responsibility for the records and transferred them to Front Royal. When Front Royal became endangered by advancing Union Army forces, Captain White had the records moved to Luray Caverns where they remained for several months. In the fall of 1864, the county's record books were rescued by Captain White and his company as Union Army troops {{were in the process of}} destroying them. Captain White's company loaded about 150 record books into a wagon, and they were taken to North Carolina where they remained safely for the duration of the war. Hampshire County's land records survived and were returned to the courthouse following the conclusion of the American Civil War, likely by a soldier returning to the area from North Carolina. Had White not separated the records and sent the bound volumes away for safekeeping, Hampshire County would have lost all its records during the course of the war, as those that remained in the courthouse were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Niadra is a zerg broodmother {{and leader}} of the Niadra Brood. She was created by Sarah Kerrigan when she battled the protoss on Kaldir. Although she succeeded in {{preventing}} them from contacting the Golden Armada, one of the protoss ships attempted to flee from the planet and travel to Shakuras. To prevent them from surviving, Kerrigan placed a parasitic larva within the captured protoss colonist Lasarra and dropped the psionic veil that prevented her from being warped back to her people. After being teleported to the ship, the protoss attempted to warn the Templar but died as the parasitic larva spawned from her body. Shortly afterwards, it began infesting the local animals kept onboard by the protoss and hid within the ventilation shafts where it found a <b>safe</b> <b>location</b> to mature into a queen. Kerrigan gave her the name Niadra and tasked her with eliminating all the protoss on board the ship, a task she accomplished with assistance from her zerg offspring. After damaging the vessel's warp drive, Niadra and her brood became the only occupants of the craft, but they had traveled beyond the reach of Kerrigan's ability to communicate. With few other options, Niadra decided to continue the Queen of Blades' last directives: to survive, grow her brood, and destroy the protoss.|$|E

25|$|At this time, the Indians near Saint-Francis {{had given}} up their {{aboriginal}} {{way of life and}} were living in a town next to a French mission. Rogers burned the town and claimed to have killed 200; the actual number was 30 killed (women and children, since the men were not in the village) and 5 captured. Following the 3 October 1759 attack and successful destruction of Saint-Francis, Rogers' force ran out of food during their retreat back through the rugged wilderness of northern Vermont. The Rangers reached a <b>safe</b> <b>location</b> along the Connecticut River at the abandoned Fort Wentworth. Rogers left them encamped, and returned a few days later with food and relief forces from Fort at Number 4, now Charlestown, New Hampshire, the nearest British town.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of April 25, in {{anticipation}} of the attack, General McNeil ordered the evacuation of women and children via steamboat to a <b>safe</b> <b>location</b> upriver. Also during the night two gunboats and a steamer arrived with additional troops to support McNeil’s forces. With the gunboats in place McNeil did not foresee any threat from the Mississippi River side of the city, so he had cannons moved from Forts A and D along the river to Forts B and C on the western side of the city. In all, McNeil's forces totaled about 4,000 men, including supporting regiments from Iowa, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Illinois, though {{it should be noted that}} some of these regiments may have arrived after the action had ended.|$|E
25|$|In fall of 1823, Jedediah Smith and Thomas Fitzpatrick led their {{trapping}} crew {{south from}} the Yellowstone River to the Sweetwater River. They {{were looking for}} a <b>safe</b> <b>location</b> to spend the winter. Smith reasoned since the Sweetwater flowed east it must eventually run into the Missouri River. Trying to transport their extensive fur collection down the Sweetwater and North Platte River, they found after a near disastrous canoe crash that the rivers were too swift and rough for water passage. On July 4, 1824, they cached their furs under a dome of rock they named Independence Rock and started their long trek on foot to the Missouri River. Upon arriving back in a settled area they bought pack horses (on credit) and retrieved their furs. They had re-discovered the route that Robert Stuart had taken in 1813—eleven years before. Thomas Fitzpatrick was often hired as a guide when the fur trade dwindled in 1840. Jedediah Smith was killed by Indians around 1831.|$|E

25|$|During {{and just}} after the Second World War, from 1940 to 1946, St Dunstan's now Blind Veterans UK, was based in the town. The {{charitable}} service (for blinded armed forces personnel) was moved from Sussex as Church Stretton {{was thought to be}} a <b>safe</b> <b>location.</b> Some 700 people were trained during this period in Church Stretton in an industrial training centre set up at a malthouse in Sandford Avenue. The Long Mynd Hotel, the Denehurst Hotel, the Brockhurst Estate and Tiger Hall were the most notable buildings taken over by St Dunstan's in the town. A residential cul-de-sac is named St Dunstan's Close in recognition of the charity's place in the town's history. The Long Mynd was considered to be a potential landing place for German parachutists, although Church Stretton avoided the aerial bombing of the war; the only death recorded in the district by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission of a civilian war casualty was of a Firewatcher from Manchester who died while being treated at the St Dunstan's Hospital.|$|E
25|$|When workers {{hunt for}} arthropods, they fly {{from side to}} side about half a meter off of the ground. Visual cues are used to {{determine}} where to search for prey, whereas olfactory cues are used to determine that prey is near, and elicit landing. Green and brown caterpillars are the most common prey for P. sericea. Once a caterpillar or other insect has been found, workers bite the insect behind the head. They will then drag the prey up onto a twig or a piece of grass, or will sometimes fly the insect to a different location; they do this in order to keep ants or other insects from stealing their prey. Once the insect is in a <b>safe</b> <b>location,</b> the wasp will malaxate the prey, or soften it by mixing it with a thinner substance, presumably saliva. The worker will then bring what it can back to the nest to feed other individuals. If prey is too large to bring back to the nest, foragers will leave the prey, and fly in side to side arcs back to the nest to recruit other workers to help carry the load.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{standard}} enemies {{from among the}} game's antagonistic force, the party can also battle Mira's indigenous wildlife. While some creatures are docile until attacked, others will attack if they hear or see you. Upon entering battle, each character attacks with their assigned automatically to a set rhythm based on their assigned weapons; each character has health points (HP) and Tension points (TP), and a morale gauge which determines their effectiveness in battle. Attack strength varies depending on a party member's position upon attacking. Healing the party in-battle {{can be done with}} types of Arts, but is mainly done using a quick-time event (QTE) tied to the Soul Voice system, a line-up of commands which trigger a Soul Challenge QTE, healing the party or granting positive effects. Successfully completing a Soul Challenge raises the party's morale. If a battle is successfully completed, knocked-out party members will revive and the party will recover HP. If the avatar is knocked out, they can either teleport to a <b>safe</b> <b>location</b> or wait and be revived if the other party members defeated all engaged enemies within thirty seconds.|$|E

25|$|The spathe {{provides}} a safe breeding {{area for the}} beetles. As such, the male beetles are often followed by female beetles {{with the intent of}} mating with the males within the spathe. The philodendrons benefit from this symbiotic relationship because the males will eventually leave the spathe covered in pollen and repeat the process at another philodendron, pollinating it in the process and thus providing philodendrons a means of sexual reproduction. In addition to gaining a <b>safe</b> <b>location</b> to mate, the male beetles may benefit from having a central location, because it allows them to broadcast to females that they are willing and able to mate. Females which see a male beetle headed for a philodendron flower know he does so with intention of mating, and females which are sexually receptive and need to mate know that they can find males if they follow the pheromones produced by the philodendron flowers. As a result, the male beetles benefit from this relationship with the philodendrons because {{they do not have to}} produce pheromones to attract females, since the philodendrons do it for them. Additionally, male beetles benefit because they are ensured of mating with only sexually receptive females, which is not necessarily certain otherwise. In doing so, the philodendron provides male beetles a more efficient way to find females than what they could achieve on their own. Interestingly, pheromones produced by the philodendrons may be similar to those produced by female beetles when they wish to attract males to mate. Also, the pheromones have a sweet, fruity smell in many species and no noticeable smell for others. In addition to the reproductive benefits to beetles, the philodendrons provide food in two forms. Pollen from the fertile male flowers is eaten by the beetles throughout the night. Secondly, the sterile male flowers consumed by the beetles are rich in lipids.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and lasted 30 minutes. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session saw Rosenqvist {{come out on top}} with a late lap time of two minutes and 12.751 seconds. He achieved this effort despite not slipstreaming any other car and recovered the lost time through the final sections of the track. Rosenqvist ended up 0.111 seconds faster than Félix da Costa with Sims a further three-tenths of a second in arrears in third place. Harry Tincknell finished the session in fourth place with Pipo Derani following in fifth having held the lead of first qualifying in the opening minutes. Sainz ended up sixth in front of Coletti and Marciello with Korjus and Jaafar—who was forced to abort his fastest time because of red flags—rounding out the top ten. Auer was the fastest driver not to reach the top ten although he was fourth {{in the early stages of}} qualifying before other drivers improved on their best efforts. Following him were Blomqvist, King the highest-placed rookie, with Giovnazzi provisionally joining King on the seventh row. Sekiguchi was next up ahead of William Buller, Nakayama, Ocon, Katsumasa Chiyo and Nicholas Latifi. The rest of the order was completed by Bryant-Meisner, Mason, Jones, van de Laar, Sean Gelael, Lynn and Sun. Wolf did not compete a lap time during qualifying because of the damage sustained to his car in the first practice session. Lynn crashed his car at Fisherman's Bend in the opening minutes of qualifying which was temporarily halted to enable marshals to push his car in a <b>safe</b> <b>location.</b> The session ended early with one minute and 37 seconds remaining after Nakayama broke his suspension in a heavy impact with the wall at Solitude Esses corner.
