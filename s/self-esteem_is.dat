5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the name-letter {{effect has}} been exploited to measure self-esteem. There {{are two types of}} self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem. Because by definition implicit <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> not accessible to introspection, measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.|$|E

40|$|Depression, hopelessness, and low <b>self-esteem</b> <b>are</b> implicated as {{vulnerability}} {{factors for}} suicide ideation. The association of self-esteem with suicide ideation {{after controlling for}} depressed mood and hopelessness was examined. Adult psychiatric outpatients (N = 338) completed measures of self-esteem, suicide ideation, hopelessness, and depression. <b>Self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> operationalized as beliefs about oneself (self-based self-esteem) and beliefs about how other people regard oneself (other-based self-esteem). Each dimension of <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> negatively associated with suicide ideation after controlling for depression and hopelessness. Of the two dimensions of <b>self-esteem,</b> other-based <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> the more robust predictor of suicide ideation. These findings suggest {{that even in the}} context of depression and hopelessness, low self-esteem may add to the risk for suicide ideation...|$|R

This review traced the evolution of the theory of threatened egotism, critically analyzed pertinent research articles, provided criticism for problematic methodological issues, and recommended areas for future research. The articles reviewed here provided evidence and support for the ability of threatened egotism to predict aggression. High <b>self-esteem</b> alone <b>was</b> not found to be a reliable predictor of aggression, but high unstable <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> linked to aggression behavior.

The second corollary of the self-esteem hypothesis - that low or threatened self-esteem will motivate intergroup discrimination and Crocker and Luhtanen’s (1990) self-enhancement hypothesis <b>were</b> examined. Collective <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> affected by status, and, contrary to the second corollary of the self-esteem hypothesis, participants with high collective <b>self-esteem</b> <b>were</b> found to show more ingroup bias (c. f. Abrams and Hogg 1988). However, status and self-esteem had interactive effects on evaluations of the ingroup and outgroup. High <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> associated with more positive ingroup evaluations only when the ingroup had high status, whereas low <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> associated with more positive outgroup evaluations only when the ingroup had low status.

It was proposed that these differences were {{due to the fact}} that (a) procedures more strongly express a social evaluation than outcomes and (b) individuals with low <b>self-esteem</b> <b>are</b> more concerned with social evaluations than individuals with high self-esteem. The implications of the results for other individual-differences factors and other populations than detainees are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine whether {{explicit}} and implicit self-esteem, the interaction between these two constructs, and their discrepancy are associated with depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and loneliness. Participants were 95 young female adults (M = 21. 2 years, SD = 1. 88) enrolled in higher education. We administered the Name Letter Task to measure implicit self-esteem, and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale to assess explicit self-esteem. The results indicated that explicit but not implicit <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> negatively associated with depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and loneliness. The interaction of implicit and explicit <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> associated with suicidal ideation, indicating that participants with high implicit self-esteem combined with a low explicit self-esteem showed more suicidal ideation. Furthermore, the size of the discrepancy between implicit and explicit <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> positively associated with depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and loneliness. In addition, results showed that the direction of the discrepancy is an important: damaged self-esteem (high implicit self-esteem combined with low explicit <b>self-esteem)</b> <b>was</b> consistently associated with increased levels of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and loneliness, while defensive or fragile self-esteem (high explicit and low implicit <b>self-esteem)</b> <b>was</b> not. Together, these findings provide new insights into the relationship of implicit and explicit self-esteem with depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and loneliness...|$|R
25|$|The Psychology of <b>Self-Esteem</b> <b>is</b> {{a book by}} Nathaniel Branden, first {{published}} in 1969. It explains Branden's theories of human psychology, focusing {{on the role of}} self-esteem. Most of the book was written during Branden's association with Ayn Rand, and it reflects some of her philosophical ideas. The book's success helped to popularize the idea of self-esteem as an important element of self-improvement.|$|E
25|$|In a 2014 {{research}} conducted by Robert S. Chavez and Todd F. Heatherton, {{it was found that}} <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> related to the connectivity of the frontostriatal circuit. The frontostriatal pathway connects the medial prefrontal cortex, which deals with self-knowledge, to the ventral striatum, which deals with feelings of motivation and reward. Stronger anatomical pathways are correlated with higher long-term self-esteem, while stronger functional connectivity is correlated with higher short-term self-esteem.|$|E
25|$|The {{fields of}} social {{psychology}} and personality have merged over the years, and social psychologists have developed an interest in self-related phenomena. In contrast with traditional personality theory, however, social psychologists place {{a greater emphasis on}} cognitions than on traits. Much research focuses on the self-concept, which is a person's understanding of his or her self. The self-concept is often divided into a cognitive component, known as the self-schema, and an evaluative component, the self-esteem. The need to maintain a healthy <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> recognized as a central human motivation in the field {{of social psychology}}.|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate if mindfulness, global- and competence-based <b>self-esteem</b> <b>are</b> potential predictors for perceived stress and symptoms of burnout in adolescents. 143 upper secondary students participated in the study. The results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that higher levels of mindfulness and global-self-esteem were associated with decreased levels of perceived stress and symptoms of burnout. Competence-based <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> only trend-significant associated with symptoms of burnout. Mediation analysis revealed that global <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> a fully mediator for the relationship between competence-based self-esteem and perceived stress.

25|$|Motivations {{direct and}} {{energize}} behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negative. In the early 1970s, Paul Ekman and colleagues began {{a line of}} research which suggests that many emotions are universal. He found evidence that humans share at least five basic emotions: fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgust. Social emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the EEA. For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared. Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> one's estimate of one's status.|$|E

When she is assigned to work with new student Annie Wilson (Shenae Grimes), she initially appears snobbish and withdrawn. Afterward, she unveils a more pleasant demeanor as the two spend time together, but also reveals an opportunistic side by attempting to plagiarize one of Annie's papers. Upon being caught, however, she becomes offended when others express doubts about her ability, and seeks to prove that she can complete the work herself.|$|E
25|$|Narcissism as a {{personality}} trait, generally assessed with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, {{is related to}} some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high on narcissism inventories {{are more likely to}} engage in counterproductive work behavior (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace). Although individuals high on narcissism might engage in more aggressive (and counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when their <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> threatened. Thus narcissistic employees are {{more likely to engage in}} CWB when they feel threatened. Individuals high in narcissism have fragile self-esteem and are easily threatened. One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact on}} {{self-esteem}} of activating self-doubt was investi-gated in three studies. Individuals with enduring high self-doubt {{were expected to}} be more threatened by an experimental induction of self-doubt (modeled on the ease of retrieval para-digm) than individuals low in enduring self-doubt, and their <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> predicted to decline. The predictions <b>were</b> sup-ported when <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> measured postexperimentally (Experi-ment 1) and when it was measured both pre- and postexperimentally (Experiment 2). There was no comparable loss in self-esteem for individuals low in self-doubt. A third experiment explored the phenomenology of low-self-doubt individuals and replicated the finding that their level of <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> unaffected by the induc-tion designed to produce doubt. Uncertainty about one’s ability in performance situa-tions suggests the prospect of failure and can prompt defensive, protective behavior.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to analyse the relationship between self-esteem and selfcompassion and to find out whether self-compassion increases optimal self-esteem. For the purposes of this study, optimal <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> operationalized as the congruence between explicit and implicit <b>self-esteem.</b> 147 participants <b>were</b> recruited to a computer-based online study. Explicit <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> measured with Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and explicit self-compassion was measured with Self- Compassion Scale (SCS). Self-esteem IAT and self-compassion IAT were developed to measure implicit self-esteem and implicit self-compassion. Regression analysis was performed to analyze which components and to what extent contribute to the congruence of explicit and implicit <b>self-esteem.</b> It <b>was</b> found that explicit selfcompassion predicted greater congruence between explicit and implicit self-esteem, implicit self-compassion did not have a significant effect. Also high self-efficacy predicted greater congruence between explicit and implicit <b>self-esteem.</b> It can <b>be</b> concluded, that self-compassion has a separate role in optimal <b>self-esteem</b> that cannot <b>be</b> described by the role of self-efficacy, as both self-compassion and self-efficacy independently predicted greater congruence between explicit and implicit self-esteem...|$|R

25|$|Numerous biases in the {{attribution}} process have been discovered. For instance, the fundamental attribution error is {{the tendency to}} make dispositional attributions for behavior, overestimating the influence of personality and underestimating the influence of situations. The actor-observer difference is a refinement of this bias, the tendency to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior and situational attributions for our own. The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people. Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality. Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).|$|E

500|$|Rand {{described}} Night of January 16th as [...] "a sense-of-life play". She did {{not want}} its events to be taken literally, but {{to be understood as}} a representation of different ways of approaching life. Andre represents an ambitious, confident, non-conformist approach to life, while the prosecution witnesses represent conformity, envy of success, and the desire for power over others. Rand believed the jury's decision at each performance revealed the attitude of the jurors towards these two conflicting senses of life. Rand supported individualism and considered Andre [...] "not guilty". She said she wanted the play to convey the viewpoint: [...] "Your life, your achievement, your happiness, [...] are of paramount importance. Live up to your highest vision of yourself no matter what the circumstances you might encounter. An exalted view of <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> man's most admirable quality". She said the play [...] "is not a philosophical treatise on morality" [...] and represents this view only in a basic way. Rand would later expound an explicit philosophy, which she called [...] "Objectivism", particularly in her 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged and in non-fiction essays, but Night of January 16th predates these more philosophical works.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, {{researchers}} Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa {{observed that}} studies repeatedly showed that Japanese {{people do not}} seek to maintain and enhance their self-esteem, unlike Europeans and Americans. Whereas research with Western participants found that, on average, people falsely believe they are better than average, that they take credit for successes and blame others for failures, and that they overestimate the chances of good fortune happening to them, studies with Japanese did not reveal such self-enhancing tendencies. In addition, in cross-cultural studies, Japanese reported self-esteem to be hurt more by failures than boosted by successes, {{the opposite of what}} was reported by Americans. All these studies involved participants being aware that their self-esteem was being evaluated, and hence they are said to be measures of explicit self-esteem. This made Kitayama and Karasawa wonder. It seemed unlikely to them that Japanese have no positive feelings attached to their selves. They hypothesized that somehow Japanese do not allow these feelings to be detected overtly. To test this, they ran two experiments that hid the aim of assessing self-esteem, measuring instead implicit self-esteem. [...] Because by definition implicit <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> not accessible to introspection, measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts. The first experiment was a replica of Nuttin's 1987 study of letter preference, looking for an effect tied to letters of the participant's name. The second experiment involved numbers, looking for an effect tied to numbers representing the day of the month a participant was born (between 1 and 31) and the month of their birthday (between 1 and 12).|$|E
