50|$|The area {{within the}} modern borders of Harrison Township was first settled in 1810, {{but it was}} {{abandoned}} after Native American attacks; no settlers returned until {{after the end of}} the War of 1812. American soldiers built two forts in 1813 for that war within the bounds of the present township: Fort Black, near Main Street in present-day New Madison, and Fort Nesbitt, in Section 32. After the war's end, some settlers returned to the area, along with many former residents of Kentucky. Growth in population enabled Harrison Township to be formed by <b>splitting</b> <b>Twin</b> Township in May 1818; its initial area was reduced by the formation of German Township in 1820. The first school was established in the township in 1819, while the township's first church was a Church of Christ.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A video {{watermarking}} {{scheme is}} proposed {{in this paper}} us-ing {{the concept of the}} secret sharing scheme. The owner’s mark is <b>split</b> into <b>twin</b> shares, where the shares are inserted into the video frames in the spatial domain in a simple manner. The detection algorithm uses a linear function applied to the twin shares to reconstruct the secret. This makes the watermarked video sequence robust against pirate attacks, such as frame averaging and frame swapping. Due to the compatibility of the exploited secret sharing scheme to geometrical distortions, the watermarking system is also robust to this kind of processing schemes. On account of insertion of various marks into different frames, which are linearly related, the watermarked sequence is robust to collusion attack that is a major concern in the field of video watermarking. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To prove {{monozygocity}} {{of human}} twin blastocysts derived from embryo splitting at the cleavage stage. Methods: Human triploid embryos at the 6 – 8 cell stage were <b>split</b> into <b>twin</b> embryos (D and R) and cultured in vitro to the blastocyst stage. Twin embryos were processed for nested multiplex PCR using fluorescently labeled primers of six selected polymorphic STR markers within the human HLA locus. Results: A total of 11 pairs of twin embryos were analyzed with PCR technology. From five pairs of twin blastocysts, the fluorograms provided detectable STR profiles for identical peak position between the twin embryos. Conclusion: This {{is the first}} report on twinned human embryos to prove monozygocity at the DNA level.

By considering a splitting variable mathematical representation of the Deterministic Equivalent Model, we specialize the so-called Branch-and-Fix Coordination algorithmic framework. It exploits the structure of the model and, specifically, the non-anticipativity constraints for the assignment variables. The algorithm uses the Twin Node Family (TNF) concept. Our procedure is specifically designed for coordinating the selection of the branching TNF and the branching S 3 set, such that the non-anticipativity constraints are satisfied.
