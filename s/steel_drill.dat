40|$|TiN-coated {{high-speed}} <b>steel</b> <b>drills</b> {{are known}} to give improved performance. However, when coatings are coupled with a careful selection of drill geometry parameters, the performance can be improved further. Consequently, in this work, progression of flank wear land width on four-faceted split-point plasma nitrided high-speed <b>steel</b> <b>drills</b> with varying point and helix angles in drilling of SS 304 was analyzed along with a conventional drill with a point angle of 118 degrees. Elaborate experimentation was undertaken to test the drills and capture the effect of flank wear on the drill performance. The drills with moderate point angle of 124 degrees outperformed other drills with point angles of 130 degrees and 118 degrees. As the wear progresses, the thrust and torque show a minor increase {{in the case of}} four-faceted drills as compared to the conventional drills.

5000|$|In 1934, H. John Eastman & Roman W. Hines of Long Beach, California, became {{pioneers in}} {{directional}} drilling when they and George Failing of Enid, Oklahoma, saved the Conroe, Texas, oil field. Failing had recently patented a portable drilling truck. He had started his company in 1931 when he mated a drilling rig to {{a truck and}} a power take-off assembly. The innovation allowed rapid drilling {{of a series of}} slanted wells. This capacity to quickly drill multiple relief wells and relieve the enormous gas pressure was critical to extinguishing the Conroe fire. In a May, 1934, Popular Science Monthly article, it was stated that [...] "Only a handful of men in the world have the strange power to make a bit, rotating a mile below ground {{at the end of a}} <b>steel</b> <b>drill</b> pipe, snake its way in a curve or around a dog-leg angle, to reach a desired objective."

5000|$|Several {{major issues}} {{contributed to the}} strike of 1913-14. One of the major {{complaints}} was the paternalism of the mines. The Copper Country copper mines operated a heavily paternalistic system, in which the mines watched closely over workers' lives {{both in and out}} of the mines. Historically, this developed for several reasons. Early mines in the distant Keweenaw wilderness had no nearby towns to supply their needs, and so the mines provided all services themselves. Most mines provided housing and schooling for miners and their families, as well as doctors, hospitalization, and even the construction of roads. Houses were assigned with preference to miners and other skilled laborers (as opposed to trammers), and to men with families (as opposed to single men). Additionally, most houses were given to certain favored ethnic groups, especially Americans [...] and Cornishmen. In exchange, miners were expected to act as the mines desired. Miners who fought, drank excessively, or were otherwise found to act improperly could be fired by the mines at any time. Another major complaint was the one-man drill. In a system of hard-rock mining inherited from Cornish mines, miners drilled blast holes in a three-man team. One man held a <b>steel</b> <b>drill,</b> while two other men took turns hitting the steel with sledgehammers. Mines began to look for improvements to this system as early as the 1870s. The first improvement came with the [...] "two man drill", which was a mechanical drill operated by compressed air. This drill was much more efficient than the three-man system, but still required two men to set up and operate. In addition, some mines allowed three men to work on the drill. As a result, the changeover from the three-man system to the two-man drill was relatively smooth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{machinable}} fluorophlogopite was drilled with tungsten-cobalt carbide and high-speed <b>steel</b> <b>drill</b> bits, respectively. The wear widths {{of major}} flank were measured, and the wear characteristic of twist was analyzed during drilling fluorophlogopite ceramics. Drilling experiments were carried to consider influence factors of drill bit wear, such as tool materials, cooling condition, spindle speed and tool angles. Tool materials and cooling conditions {{are the major}} factors to affect wear of drill bits. High-speed <b>steel</b> <b>drill</b> bits are not suitable for drilling fluorophlogopite ceramics. Cooling condition affects wear remarkably. With the rising of spindle speed, the wear widths of major flank grows. But apex angle has little affects on the tool wear rate.

40|$|For the {{geothermal}} wells of the Delft Aardwarmte Project it {{has been}} chosen to drill with glass-reinforced epoxy (GRE) composite casing in a drilling-with-casing setup. This MSc thesis report describes the results of experimental work to assess the stress-strain behaviour of GRE casing, in particular under axial, torsional and combined axial-torsional loading. These properties have subsequently been {{used to assess the}} effects of using GRE casing on standard drilling properties such as the stretch and twist of the drilling tubulars, and the effect on torsional vibrations. The following conclusions can be drawn: 1. For axial loads (in tension) up to 33 % of the expected maximum drilling loads: a. No evidence was found of non-linear behavior. b. The measured elasticity modulus is 1. 91 * 1010 N/m², which corresponds closely to the manufacturer’s data. c. The maximum expected elongation of a GRE casing string of 3300 m used for drilling-with-casing is 1. 66 m, which is 0. 06 m more than that of a <b>steel</b> <b>drill</b> pipe under similar drilling conditions [...] 2. For torsional loads up to 98 % of the expected maximum drilling loads: a. The stress-strain behaviour in the tangential direction remains linear. b. The shear modulus measured is deemed incorrect due to the mechanical properties of the test bench. The shear modulus as reported by the manufacturer is 6. 78 * 109 N/m 2. c. The maximum expected twist in a GRE casing string of 3300 m used for drilling-with-casing is 9. 25 turns which is 6. 3 turns more than that of a <b>steel</b> <b>drill</b> pipe under similar drilling conditions. d. The natural frequency in torsional vibration of a GRE casing is much lower than that of a steel casing in a comparable drilling setup due to its much lower torsional stiffness. However the large diameter of casing, as compared to conventional drill pipe, results in an increase in torsional stiffness. The combined effect is an increased natural frequency of GRE casing compared to <b>steel</b> <b>drill</b> pipe. e. As a result, the critical rotary speed, i. e the rotary speed below which one can expect the occurrence of stick-slip torsional vibrations, is lower for GRE casing than for steel drilling pipe under similar drilling conditions, i. e. the effect is beneficial. 3. Under increasing axial tension the torsional stress-strain behaviour displays an increasing hysteresis. a. The torsional dampening, expressed as energy loss per loading/unloading cycle ranges from xx% to xx%. This is much higher than the typical internal torsional damping in <b>steel</b> <b>drill</b> pipe. b. The typical external torsional dampening caused by fluid drag and borehole friction while drilling is in the order of 50 %. The effect of internal damping caused by hysteresis during torsional loading of GRE casing is therefore noticeable, and results in a further beneficial decrease in the critical rotary speed for stick-slip torsional vibrations.
