40|$|For further {{research}} on the precondition and interoperability model of interaction ladles among continuous caster, this article takes steel ladle of Y steel works {{as the object of}} research. On the basis of turnover number calculation model of single <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> <b>ladle,</b> the relationship between cast number and the turnover number and turnover times and last turnover number are further analyzed. The simulation of steel ladle turnover rules was taken on the 2 continuous casters with Gantt chart. After that, the relationships between turnover number and last turnover number and non-turnover number are researched deeply. Combining with the Gantt chart, the expressions of start casting time and empty ladle ending time and heavy ladle starting time were put forward. The precondition of steel ladle interaction is obtained, which means the exchange ladle should not undertaking transport task in first stop continuous caster, and the empty ladle end time of exchange ladle of first stop continuous caster should early than the heavy ladle start time of last stop continuous caster. After applying the model to practice, 3 steel ladles of No. 2 continuous caster can be reduced. This research results is supplying theoretical basis for steel ladle controlling and production organization optimization, and enriches the theory and method of metallurgical process integration...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The inverse problem {{consisting}} in {{the identification}} of volumetric latent heat of <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> is presented. Additionally it is assumed that the courses of temperature at the points from the casting or mould are known. The substitute thermal capacity of <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> (this parameter is directly connected with the latent heat) is approximated by the fourth-degree polynomial. In order to solve the inverse problem the least squares criterion containing the sensitivity coefficients is applied. In the final part of the paper the results of computations are shown. Design/methodology/approach: In this work numerical modelling of solidification process is applied. A <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> solidifying in a sand mould is analyzed. The information concerning the course of cooling curve at the selected point from the casting domain is used in order to identify the latent heat of <b>steel</b> <b>cast.</b> Findings: It is shown that only one sensor located at the optional point from casting or mould domain gives the information sufficient for successful identification of unknown parameter. Research limitations/implications: Further work requires an introducing of real temperature measurements to the model presented. Practical implications: The paper shows the possibilities of thermophysical parameters identification on the basis of temperature measurements. In the case considered the latent heat of <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> has been identified. Originality/value: The algorithm presented allows to identify the latent heat {{in the case of the}} complex, temperature dependent function determining the substitute thermal capacity of metallic alloy...|$|R
