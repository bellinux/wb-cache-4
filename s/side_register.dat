40|$|Travel {{times to}} Japanese {{stations}} from the Longshot underground explosion of October 29, 1965, were studied. The arrival times of P waves are 1. 5 to 3 seconds {{earlier than the}} Jeffreys-Bullen (J-B) time. A systematic variation of the J-B residual was found {{in relation to the}} seismic plane which dips downward from the Pacific Ocean side towards the continent; a station on the Pacific Ocean <b>side</b> <b>registered</b> a relatively early arrival (- 3 sec), while stations on the Japan Sea <b>side</b> <b>registered</b> relatively late arrivals (- 1. 5 sec). This systematic variation can be interpreted in terms of a structural anomaly associated with the deep seismic plane. The simplest of all the models which explain this systematic variation is the one in which the P-wave velocity in the top 250 km of the mantle is reduced by 0. 4 km/sec on the continental side as compared with that on the ocean side of the deep seismic plane. The amplitude ratio of PcP to P also provides a favorable evidence for this model. The average Q is estimated as 80 in the top 250 km of the mantle on the continental side of the deep seismic plane. The low velocity and Q can be explained in terms of a temperature excess of about 500 ℃ coupled with a partial melting of about 2 %. Such anomalous structure would have an important bearing on various island-arc tectonics such as the magma generation and convection. The arrival times at Japanese stations are compared with those at stations elsewhere in the world. The earliest arrival among the Japanese stations is comparable to that at stations on relatively old crust, and the latest to that at stations on relatively young crust. The residual at Japanese stations, on the average, is not anomalous as compared with the world average. | 1965 年 10 月 29 日に行なわれた地下爆発Longshotの日本への走時をしらべた.

Now follows the summary included in this report: Government objective on speed is to reduce the level of speeders on main urban and secondary rural roads to maximally 10 % in the year 2000. To enable monitoring the speed level a design for a traffic measuring network on secondary rural roads was made and installed in several provinces. The data from this network serves two purposes: use for national policy on speed and for provincial speed management. Speed management through automatic warning and enforcement combined with information campaign and feed back signs has been applied and evaluated: a) An urban and rural intersectii: speeders are warned automatically by a sign switchable sign. Mean speed dropped by minimally 5 km/h. The number of accidents was too small for a statistical evaluation. A theoretical calculation showed a considerable potential for accident reduction; b) Two lane rural road stretches: on four stretches of road, length between I 0 and 20 kin, speeders are warned automatically and when ignored a radar+camera registers the number plate of the car and a fine is sent later. The percentage of speeders dropped from 38 to 11 %, the number of accidents was reduced with 35 %. Vandalism of the radar and camera occurred several times; and c) Provincial road network: the total road length enforced in three provinces was 700 km, the duration was 6 months. A radar and camera from an unmarked car parked on the road <b>side</b> <b>registers</b> speeders. A sign was posted downstream reading 'Your speed has been checked. Police'. Speed was reduced by 5 km/h. Surveys conducted among drivers showed the enforcement measures were accepted by the majority of the drivers...|$|R
