5|$|As <b>Syzygy</b> and Nutting {{prepared}} for the MOA show, Bushnell learned that another pair of engineers were also creating an arcade version of Spacewar. In August 1971 Bushnell called Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck, operating as Mini-Computer Applications, {{so that they could}} meet and discuss their solutions to the problem of running Spacewar on an inexpensive computer. Pitts and Tuck were developing a prototype machine of Galaxy Game when they met with Bushnell; the game, however, while a faithful recreation of Spacewar, ran on an externally-connected DEC PDP-11 with a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display, and the total cost of the prototype unit was US$20,000. The <b>Syzygy</b> duo were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that Galaxy Game was not using an innovative solution <b>Syzygy</b> had missed to build an economically-competitive arcade game. Pitts and Tuck, conversely, felt that Computer Space was a pale imitation of Spacewar, while Galaxy Game was a superior adaptation of the game. They eventually produced two game prototypes, both displayed in the Stanford student union building, but never produced the game commercially due to the high cost of the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, Bushnell and Dabney founded <b>Syzygy</b> Engineering as an {{official}} company, now with a cash amount of US$350. They approached Ampex and a prior manager of Dabney's with their prototype, but found no interest. The major arcade game manufacturers were based out of Chicago at the time, limiting their ability to demonstrate their idea to an existing firm. During a dentist appointment in early 1971, Bushnell told the dentist about the game {{and that he was}} looking for a manufacturer; the dentist in turn referred him to another patient of his, Dave Ralstin, the sales manager for Nutting Associates in Mountain View, California. Nutting had been founded in 1967 on the basis of Computer Quiz, an analog quiz arcade game, and by 1971 was looking for another hit game. After meeting with Bushnell, Nutting felt that his game was the potential success they needed to replace falling sales of Computer Quiz updates, as they had not had a hit game since. Nutting not only agreed to manufacture the game but also hired Bushnell as their chief engineer, as they had no real engineering team at the time. Furthermore, <b>Syzygy</b> Engineering retained ownership of the game, even though Nutting agreed to give <b>Syzygy</b> space to build the prototype and to manufacture the game once complete. <b>Syzygy</b> would be paid five percent of each cabinet sold. Bushnell negotiated to work on Cosmic Combat outside of normal working hours until it went into production in order to keep it conceptually separate from his new job at Nutting so as to prevent Nutting from later claiming ownership due to paying for time or materials spent building the game. Dabney remained at Ampex until the summer, when he resigned to join Bushnell at Nutting, as he was initially unwilling to leave the stable job he'd worked at for ten years without more proof that the game could be a success.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} by Bushnell and Dabney during 1970–71 to be a coin-operated version of Spacewar. After the pair were {{unable to find a}} way to economically run the game on a minicomputer such as the Data General Nova, they hit upon the idea of instead replacing the central computer with custom-designed hardware created just to run that game. After they built an early proof of concept and founded <b>Syzygy</b> Engineering, Bushnell found a manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. Working in partnership with Nutting, the pair ran their first location test in August 1971, a few months prior to the display of a similar prototype called Galaxy Game, also based on Spacewar. After encouraging initial results, though mixed responses from distributors, Nutting ordered an initial production run of 1,500 units with the anticipation of a hit game. While the game was successful and validated Syzygy's belief in the future of arcade video games, selling over 1,000 cabinets by mid-1972 and ultimately 1,300–1,500 units, it was not the runaway success that Nutting had hoped for. The game spawned one clone game, Star Trek (1972), and Nutting produced a two-player version of Computer Space in 1973 without involvement from <b>Syzygy</b> before closing in 1976. <b>Syzygy</b> went on to be incorporated as Atari, with their next arcade game the successful Pong (1972). Although not as influential as Pong, Computer Spaces release marked the initial start of the commercial video game industry.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the spaces of minimal rank last <b>syzygies</b> for the Mukai Varieties of sectional genus 6, 7 and 8. Based on this we show: 1. The first geometric <b>syzygies</b> {{of a general}} canonical curve of genus 6 form a non degenerate configuration of 5 lines in P^ 4. 2. The first geometric <b>syzygies</b> of a general canonical curve of genus 7 form a non degenerate, linearly normal, ruled surface of degree 84 on a spinor variety S in P^ 15. 3. The second geometric <b>syzygies</b> of a general canonical curve of genus 8 form a non degenerate configuration of 14 conics on a 2 -uple embedded P^ 5 in P^ 20. This proves a natural generalization of Green's conjecture [1984], namely that the geometric <b>syzygies</b> should span the space of all <b>syzygies,</b> in these cases. We have generalized results 1 and 3 to general curves of even genus in math. AG/ 0108078. Result 2 is the main new result of this paper. Comment: 44 pages; 1 figure; AMSlatex.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the connection between}} the moduli space of N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories and the set of polynomial gauge invariants constrained by classical/quantum relations called <b>syzygies.</b> We examine the existence of a superpotential reproducing these <b>syzygies</b> and the link with the ’t Hooft anomaly matching between the fundamental fields at high energy and the gauge invariant degrees of freedom at low energy for the flavour symmetry group. We show that the anomaly matching is equivalent to the vanishing of the flavour anomaly on the normal space to the manifold defined by the <b>syzygies.</b> For normal spaces in a real representation of the flavour group we strengthen {{the connection between the}} ’t Hooft anomaly matching and the existence of a superpotential by constructing a flavour invariant polynomial whose gradient vanishes at least on the solutions of the <b>syzygies.</b> This corroborates a recent definition of confining theories. We illustrate our general result by considering two examples based on the SU(Nc) and Spin(7) gauge theories. We also examine the role of <b>syzygies</b> in the context of non-Abelian duality. We emphasize the relevance of non-perturbative effects in the dual magnetic theories in proving the equivalence of the electric and magnetic <b>syzygies...</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{agreeing on}} an initial idea, Bushnell and Dabney {{began trying to}} design a {{prototype}} based on a Data General Nova. Initially {{they were joined by}} Larry Bryan, a computer programmer who also worked at Ampex. Bushnell and Dabney put US$100 each into a partnership, named <b>Syzygy</b> by Bryan. They soon ran into difficulties with their planned design; the computer was not powerful enough to refresh the monitors as fast as was needed to make the game playable. Bryan realized this early on, when trying to design the code needed to run the games, and left the project before <b>Syzygy</b> was formed without ever contributing any money, but Bushnell and Dabney continued working on the design for several more months. The pair attempted to reduce the load on the computer by replacing subroutines—such as displaying the background stars—with specialized hardware, but it proved insufficient; even reducing the number of monitors was not enough. By the end of November 1970, Bushnell decided to abandon the project as untenable, while Dabney had stopped working on the design a while before. It is unclear if the pair were aware that Data General had demonstrated a more powerful variant of the Nova, sold for US$8,000, running a single game of Spacewar at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, though that solution would have been too expensive for an arcade game, which typically cost US$1,000 at the time. Unable to put the game idea out of his mind, however, Bushnell soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen without a computer controlling it, and from there <b>Syzygy</b> {{came up with the idea}} of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle everything for the game instead.|$|E
5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as <b>syzygy.</b> In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|Once {{he moved}} to Nutting, Bushnell took over the {{majority}} of the engineering work for the game; Dabney has stated that he advised Bushnell on some of the design, and that some of the construction was done by Steve Bristow, an intern at Ampex. There is disagreement in interviews with Bushnell and Dabney as to how much work Dabney did on the final cabinet, with Dabney claiming credit for the controls, sound, power supply, initial wooden cabinet, and invention of the hyperspace color inversion, while Bushnell claims credit for everything but the sound, cabinet, power supply, and monitor. By August 1971, an initial prototype of the game—now named Computer Space to be similar to Computer Quiz—was complete, and <b>Syzygy</b> moved on to location testing. They installed the game at the Dutch Goose bar near Stanford University, where it met with great success. Nutting was heartened by the response and rushed to make several finished cabinets for the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition in October. Further location tests found a less enthusiastic response from customers confused by the game mechanics and controls, and <b>Syzygy</b> hurriedly tried to adjust the game to be more understandable to players.|$|E

5|$|Computer Space is a space combat arcade game {{developed}} in 1971 {{as one of}} the last games created in the early history of video games. Created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in partnership as <b>Syzygy</b> Engineering, it was the first arcade video game as well as the first commercially available video game. Computer Space is a derivative of the 1962 computer game Spacewar!, possibly the first video game to spread to multiple computer installations. It features a rocket, controlled by the player, engaged in a missile battle with a pair of flying saucers set against a background starfield. The goal is to score more hits than the enemy spaceships within a set time period, which awards a free round of gameplay. The game is enclosed in a custom fiberglass cabinet in one of four colors, which Bushnell designed himself to be futuristic.|$|E

Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to the university to interview witnesses to the death. A teaching assistant tells Black that the dead girl was highly intelligent, pointing out an armillary sphere Lauren had constructed. She also tells Black that the previous Millennium Group contact had taken great interest in this sphere. Black did not realize the Group had sent another member, but on leaving, he meets the man in question—Dennis Hoffman (Brad Dourif). Hoffman describes his theories to Black, detailing how when several planets achieve <b>syzygy</b> on May 5, 2000, a series of natural disasters will bring {{about the end of}} the world.

5|$|That {{game was}} Computer Space, {{developed}} by Bushnell and Ted Dabney. They {{had found the}} Data General Nova, a US$4,000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of Spacewar at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would be much less expensive: as low as $100. By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed {{for a short time}} in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called <b>Syzygy.</b> Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that Galaxy Game was not a real competitor to Computer Space, due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that Galaxy Game was a true expansion of Spacewar, while Computer Space just a pale imitation. Some players at the time, however, believed Galaxy Game to actually be just a version of Spacewar!. Galaxy Games prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan.|$|E
