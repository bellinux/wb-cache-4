5|$|The {{film was}} advertised to the American churchgoer {{as a moral}} picture.

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Tayutama mainly {{consists of}} reading a text-based, branching plot line with multiple endings, and offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction {{based on the}} player's decisions. The game received two awards from the 2008 Bishōjo Game Awards for its visuals. It received a fan disc titled Tayutama: It's Happy Days in May 2009, and made several transitions to other media. It received a manga adaptation illustrated by artist Yukiwo, who co-created an original <b>story</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> adaptation. A twelve-episode anime series produced by the animation studio Silver Link was broadcast in Japan between April and June 2009. A manga anthology series drawn by multiple artists, an Internet radio talk show used to promote the anime adaptation, and several music albums were also released.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} {{cinematic}} scenes {{was written by}} Naoki Mori, who joined the project for one and a quarter years in his role: the cinematic director was Shigeki Yoshida, who was brought on {{at the same time}} as and worked on the storyboards with Mori. The initial script was proposed by Fujibayashi based on his perception of the game's structure. As the game's theme was the use of the sword, and the sword most associated with the series was the Master Sword, the team decided to make it an origin <b>story</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> weapon. An early element was whether to incorporate the creation of Hyrule, while also needing to explain the creation of Skyloft: this initial stage of story development ended up being difficult as their initial story plans were full of contradictions to established series lore due to them wanting to create an origin <b>story</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire series. These issues were further complicated by the third year of development with the necessity of finalizing the gameplay and environments. Feigning illness, Fujibayashi shut himself away in a hotel room and wrote the synopsis in a single day. Mori wrote the dialogue based on Fujibayashi's synopsis, who needed to work out the fine details with Fujibayashi. A scene Fujibayashi was intent on including was where Zelda jumped from the edge of Skyloft and Link caught her: this was fitted in for the two characters after the end of Link's exam. The early part of the story was quite different from earlier Zelda titles, playing out in a similar way to a school drama. Once the script was finished, it was handed to Yoshida so his team could create the cinematics. The total number of cinematics was estimated as 79, coming to over 120 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Two new {{characters}} {{were introduced in}} this episode. The first, Nelson Muntz, remains a frequently used recurring character, while the second, Herman, has been used far less. The design of Herman, {{with the exception of}} his missing arm, was inspired by writer John Swartzwelder. His voice, as performed by Harry Shearer, was partly inspired by George H. W. Bush. The original idea for Herman was for him to have a differing <b>story</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss of his arm with every appearance.|$|E
5|$|When {{the goddess}} is at last placated, the {{retrieving}} god escorts {{her back to}} Egypt. Her return {{marks the beginning of}} the inundation and the new year. The pacified Eye deity is once more a procreative consort for the sun god, or, in some versions of the <b>story,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> god who brings her back. Mehit becomes the consort of Anhur, Tefnut is paired with Shu, and Thoth's spouse is sometimes Nehemtawy, a minor goddess associated with this pacified form of the Eye. In many cases, the Eye goddess and her consort then produce a divine child who becomes the new sun god. The goddess' transformation from hostile to peaceful is a key step in the renewal of the sun god and the kingship that he represents.|$|E
