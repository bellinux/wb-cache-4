5|$|Due {{to their}} shared {{association}} with skiing {{and the fact}} that both place names referring to Ullr and Skaði appear most frequently in Sweden, <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> proposed a particular connection between the two gods. On the other hand, Skaði may potentially be a masculine form and, as a result, <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> theorized that Skaði may have originally been a male deity.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{traditional}} gender associations, <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> {{argued that the}} poem provides “both a language and models for critiquing sexual mores and social institutions” and encourages women to engage in scientific pursuits.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> {{argued that}} Buddhaghosa's writing evinces a strong but {{unacknowledged}} Yogācāra Buddhist influence, which subsequently came to characterize Theravada {{thought in the}} wake of his profound influence on the Theravada tradition.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Some</b> <b>scholars,</b> however, <b>have</b> {{argued that}} war {{can have a}} {{positive}} effect on political development.|$|R
5000|$|In modern times, the {{distinction}} was frequently revived, mainly - and quite {{in contrast to}} Eusebius' views - [...] "to support the denial of the Apostolic origin of the Fourth Gospel",whose [...] "beauty and richness" [...] <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>had</b> difficulty in ascribing to a [...] "fisherman from Gallilee".|$|R

5|$|Scholars also {{debate the}} exact {{influence}} of Jewish thought on Durkheim's work. The answer remains uncertain; <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> argued that Durkheim's thought {{is a form}} of secularized Jewish thought, while others argue that proving the existence of a direct influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's achievements is difficult or impossible.|$|E
5|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually {{nothing to do with}} the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels. Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> suggested that Jesus himself was a myth.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject matter}} of the third letter {{is similar to that of}} the second letter, and <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> {{explained}} this as a result of Swift being forced to respond so quickly to the Privy-council's report. The Drapier emphasises his humble nature and simple understanding when appealing to the pride of his audience, the nobility.|$|E

50|$|The oracle bones {{bear the}} {{earliest}} known significant corpus of ancient Chinese writing and contain important historical information such as the complete royal genealogy of the Shang dynasty. When they were discovered and deciphered {{in the early twentieth}} century, these records confirmed the existence of the Shang, which <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>had</b> until then doubted.|$|R
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{regards the}} main influences {{at play in}} the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by the Greek alphabet, or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic. Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and numeric value of letters. <b>Some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters.|$|E
5|$|Bal Gangadhar Tilak has {{credited}} Jainism {{with the}} cessation of slaughter of animals in the brahamanical religion. <b>Some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> traced the origin of Ahimsa to Jains and their precursor, the sramanas. According to Thomas McEvilley, a noted Indologist, certain seals of Indus Valley civilisation depict a meditative figure surrounded by a multitude of wild animals, providing evidence of proto yoga tradition in India akin to Jainism. This particular image might suggest that all the animals depicted are sacred to this particular practitioner. Consequently, these animals would be protected from harm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> {{disagreed}} with parts of Watson's proposal, {{arguing that the}} four staple crops were already widely disseminated before that period, and that Islamic irrigation built on rather than replacing the Roman irrigation network in Spain. Against this, the historian Paolo Squatriti, reviewing Watson's paper 40 years on, noted that it had proven useful to many different historical agendas, and had held up surprisingly well {{in the face of}} new findings in archaeology and archaeobotany.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> {{indicated}} that Sholay contains homosocial themes. Ted Shen describes the male bonding {{shown in the}} film as bordering on camp style. Dina Holtzman, in her book Bollywood and Globalization: Indian Popular Cinema, Nation, and Diaspora, states that the death of Jai, and resultant break of bonding between the two male leads, {{is necessary for the}} sake of establishing a normative heterosexual relationship (that of Veeru and Basanti).|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> {{tried to}} {{reconcile}} the conflicting accounts of the Chronicle and the De administrando imperio as implying a first recovery of Patras c. 805 {{as the result of}} Skleros' campaign, which was probably concurrent with the establishment of the Peloponnese as a separate theme from Hellas, if this had not been done slightly earlier. According to this interpretation, the Slavic revolt and attack on Patras followed as a reaction a few years later, between 807 and 811.|$|E
5|$|While {{the status}} of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial, <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> claimed that Greenlandic has a basic {{temporal}} distinction between future and non-future. Especially, the suffix -ssa and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be obligatory future markers. However, at least for literary Greenlandic, these suffixes have been shown to have other semantics {{that can be used to}} refer to the future via the strategies just described.|$|E
30|$|<b>Some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>had</b> already {{stressed}} the accelerated modulus-based matrix splitting iteration methods for linear complementarity problems {{and pointed out}} that the system matrix is either a positive definite matrix or an H_+-matrix. However, we suggest that the system matrix is a P-matrix, this is more adaptable but also a limitation. Notwithstanding its limitation, this study does suggest that WNCP can be solved faster.|$|R
5000|$|Louis Feldman {{states that}} the {{question}} [...] "is Josephus {{the author of the}} additions and modifications in the Slavonic version" [...] has usually received a negative answer. Craig A Evans states that although <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>had</b> in the past supported the Slavonic Josephus, [...] "to my knowledge no one today believes that they contain anything of value for Jesus research".|$|R

5|$|If {{the church}} from the {{marginal}} note is equated with the Round Church, {{then it can}} be conclusively dated {{to no more than}} a few years before 907. While the church can be ascribed to no later than the 10th century, <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> suggested that it may have been constructed directly on top of a much earlier late Roman basilica due to its antiquated plan. A possible donor (ktetor) of at least part of the church's construction is a high-ranking church official (chartophylax) named Paul, who is mentioned in an inscription inside the church. The main part of the work was likely funded by Simeon, who may have acted as a chief sponsor.|$|E
5|$|In {{different}} eras, various gods {{were said}} to hold the highest position in divine society, including the solar deity Ra, the mysterious god Amun, and the mother goddess Isis. The highest deity was usually credited {{with the creation of}} the world and often connected with the life-giving power of the sun. <b>Some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> argued, based in part on Egyptian writings, that the Egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all the other deities. Yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic view of the world, except possibly during the era of Atenism in the 14th century BC, when official religion focused exclusively on the impersonal sun god Aten.|$|E
5|$|Mona Lisa {{fulfilled}} 15th- {{and early}} 16th century requirements for portraying {{a woman of}} virtue. Lisa is portrayed as a faithful wife through gesture—her right hand rests over her left. Leonardo also presented Lisa as fashionable and successful, perhaps more well-off than she was. Her dark garments and black veil were Spanish-influenced high fashion; {{they are not a}} depiction of mourning for her first daughter, as <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> proposed. The portrait is strikingly large; its size is equal to that of commissions acquired by wealthier art patrons of the time. This extravagance has been explained as a sign of Francesco and Lisa's social aspiration.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> {{suggested}} that Muḥammad {{used the term}} Allah in addressing both pagan Arabs and Jews or Christians {{in order to establish}} a common ground for the understanding of the name for God, a claim Gerhard Böwering says is doubtful. According to Böwering, in contrast with pre-Islamic Arabian polytheism, God in Islam does not have associates and companions, nor is there any kinship between God and jinn. Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God.|$|E
5|$|The Anatolian peninsula, {{comprising}} most {{of modern}} Turkey, {{is one of}} the oldest permanently settled regions in the world. Various ancient Anatolian populations have lived in Anatolia, from at least the Neolithic period until the Hellenistic period. Many of these peoples spoke the Anatolian languages, a branch of the larger Indo-European language family. In fact, given the antiquity of the Indo-European Hittite and Luwian languages, <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> proposed Anatolia as the hypothetical centre from which the Indo-European languages radiated. The European part of Turkey, called Eastern Thrace, has also been inhabited since at least forty thousand years ago, and is known to have been in the Neolithic era by about 6000 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} extant work on astrology that is extensive, coherent, {{and mostly}} intact, the Astronomica describes celestial phenomena, and, in particular, the zodiac and astrology. The poemwhich {{seems to have}} been inspired by Lucretius's Epicurean poem De rerum naturaespouses a Stoic, deterministic understanding of a universe overseen by a god and governed by reason. The fifth book of the Astronomica features a lacuna, which has led to debate about the original size of the poem; <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> argued that whole books have been lost over the years, whereas others believe only a small section of the work is missing.|$|E

Many scholars would currently view the Mystagogic Catecheses as being written by Cyril, but in the 370s or 380s, rather than {{at the same time as}} the Catechetical Lectures.|$|R
50|$|Research {{into the}} media and {{violence}} examines whether links between consuming media violence and subsequent aggressive and violent behaviour exists. Although <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>had</b> claimed media violence may increase aggression, this view is coming increasingly in doubt both in the scholarly community and {{was rejected by the}} US Supreme Court in the Brown v EMA case, as well as in a review of video game violence by the Australian Government (2010) which concluded evidence for harmful effects were inconclusive at best and the rhetoric of <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> was not matched by good data.|$|R
