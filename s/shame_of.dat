5|$|With {{regard to}} sexual {{orientation}} categories, asexuality may be argued {{as not being}} a meaningful category {{to add to the}} continuum, and instead argued as the lack of a sexual orientation or sexuality. Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one's natural sexuality, and that it is a disorder caused by <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> sexuality, anxiety or sexual abuse, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner. Within the context of sexual orientation identity politics, asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a sexual orientation identity category.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 13 September 1810 was an {{inconclusive}} frigate engagement {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars between British Royal Navy and French Navy frigates during which a British frigate {{was defeated by}} two French vessels near Isle de France (now Mauritius), but British reinforcements were able to recapture the ship before the French could secure her. The British frigate was HMS Africaine, a new arrival to the Indian Ocean. She was {{under the command of}} Captain Robert Corbet, who had served there the previous year. Corbet was a notoriously unpopular officer and his death in the battle provoked a storm of controversy in Britain over claims that Corbet had either committed suicide at the <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> losing his ship, been murdered by his disaffected crew, or been abandoned by his men, who were said to have refused to load their guns while he remained in command. Whether any of these rumours were accurate has never been satisfactorily determined, but the issue has been discussed in several prominent naval histories and was the subject of at least one lawsuit.|$|E

25|$|The Takembeng {{practices}} often involve {{groups of}} thirty {{to a couple}} of hundred women participating in wider protests in Bamenda (the Northwest Region capital), but separated from other protesters by large spaces. Nudity, public defecation and urination are used, in connection with the precolonial practices, to emphasize the <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> anti-democratic practices and to prevent disruption by police or security forces.

25|$|In these lectures, Newman denounced various anti-Catholic utterances.

Newman emphasises the importance of responding to Achilli: For how, Brothers of the Oratory, can we possibly believe a man like this , in what he says about persons and facts, and conversations, and events, when he is of the stamp of Maria Monk, of Jeffreys, and of Teodore, and of others who have had their hour, and then been dropped by the indignation or the <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> mankind.|$|E
25|$|Ovid's {{version of}} this story (Heroides 9) has Heracles under the erotic control of Iole. She {{specifically}} has Heracles wear women's clothing and perform women's work. Heracles at this time all the while is bragging about his heroic deeds. However, Deianira reminds him how he is dressed in feminine attire and Iole is wearing his clothing while carrying his club. Deianira ultimately urges silence from him. The same version shows the disgrace and <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> Heracles, who was once a strong warrior fighter, outwitted by Iole in being made to do effeminate acts. In this skillful crafty manner, she had avenged her father's death.|$|E

25|$|Contrastingly {{in other}} Asian cultures, {{especially}} for families in South Asia and the Far East, family honor depends on other {{factors such as}} education. Academic success of a student {{is seen as a}} source of pride and honor for the Asian family. Therefore, both the Asian student and the parents work hard to avoid academic failure which brings shame to the family. In the past, honor in East Asia was also linked to success in the battlefield. In Japan, for example, ritualized suicide practices such as harakiri were committed by Japanese samurai for centuries {{in the event of a}} defeat in battle. Instead of being captured or living with the <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> defeat, harakiri was committed in order to preserve the honor of their families.|$|E
25|$|Alice courageously {{faces the}} <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> bearing and rearing their illegitimate {{daughter}} Anna alone. This ordeal is {{the test of}} the title—of herself, her family, and her community. Her story is paralleled in a subplot involving Sallie, a sinner of a lower sort. Over the years Alice is supported by some, notably the senator, but vilified {{by most of the}} small-minded townsfolk, including her own mother. Her sister Gertrude, engaged to the priggish clergyman John Prescott, also suffers, her intended suddenly developing cold feet at the news of Alice's indiscretion. Perhaps the height of Alice's suffering is reached when Harriet, having lost her own child, importunes her to let her have Anna instead; persuaded {{it would be in the}} best interest of her daughter, Alice finally complies.|$|E
25|$|People who are {{homeless}} {{tend to be}} socially isolated, which contributes negatively to their mental health. Studies have correlated that those who {{are homeless}} and have a strong support group tend to be more physically and mentally healthy. Aside from the stigma received by the homeless population, another aspect that contributes to social isolation is the purposeful avoidance of social opportunity practiced by the homeless community out of <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> revealing their current homeless state. Social isolation ties directly to social stigma in that homeless socialization outside of the homeless community will affect how the homeless are perceived. This is why homeless individuals talking with those who are not homeless is encouraged since it can combat the stigma that is often associated with homelessness.|$|E

25|$|Eliade {{provided}} {{two distinct}} explanations {{for not having}} met with Sebastian: one was related to his claim of being followed around by the Gestapo, and the other, expressed in his diaries, was that the <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> representing a regime that humiliated Jews had made him avoid facing his former friend. Another take on the matter was advanced in 1972 by the Israeli magazine Toladot, who claimed that, as an official representative, Eliade was aware of Antonescu's agreement to implement the Final Solution in Romania and of how this could affect Sebastian (see Holocaust in Romania). In addition, rumors were sparked that Sebastian and Nina Mareş had a physical relationship, one which could {{have contributed to the}} clash between the two literary figures.|$|E

She returns {{to live with}} her family, but is furtively sought by the local regent, who wants her as his second wife. Using bribery and magic, he is able to {{convince}} her to elope with him. Oeij Se, distraught at Kim Nio having married outside her race, disowns her and acts as if she were dead, going as far as to construct a grave for her. To avoid the <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> his daughter's actions, Oeij Se moves to Batavia. Some months later Kim Nio (now a Muslim and known as Siti Fatimah) visits, seemingly to make amends with her family. She takes back her daughter and then returns to Pekalongan, dying there after seeing her own grave.|$|E
25|$|According to the anti-religious press, priests would wander from {{village to}} village surreptitiously {{performing}} religious {{services in the}} homes of believers, while being disguised as wandering repairmen, or some other profession. It also claimed the young people were being attracted to Christianity by clergy who hired themselves out free of charge to youth parties as games organizers, musicians, choir directors, readers of secular Russian literature, drama-circle directors, etc. It also claimed that many believers were keeping themselves away from churches and priests due to <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> observing religious ritual overtly, and that in response to this many priests performed religious rituals in absentia; this meant that marriage ceremonies were performed over rings that were then sent to absent bride and groom, or that funeral services were performed over empty coffins in which the corpse was later laid in a secular funeral.|$|E
