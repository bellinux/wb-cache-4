40|$|Background Perimedullary {{arteriovenous}} fistulas (PMAVFs) {{are rare}} spinal lesions {{and even more}} uncommon in children. Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to document rare occurrences of this type of arteriovenous malformation in six children treated at our institution. Methods The clinical data, radiological findings, and treatment in six cases of PMAVFs were reviewed. Six patients with PMAVFs were managed at our institution over a 5 -year period. The patients (four girls and two boys), ranging in age from 6 to 15 years, presented with initially fluctuating, and eventually permanent and progressive, sudden-onset paraparesis, sensory disturbances, and sphincter dysfunction. The duration of symptoms before diagnosis ranged from 1 week to 13 years. Results All the patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging and <b>spinal</b> selective <b>angiography,</b> which demonstrated the characteristic imaging of an arteriovenous fistula. Embolization of the arteriovenous fistula was initially attempted in three patients with successful occlusion of the fistula in two. For the remaining cases, open surgery was performed, with complete occlusion of the fistula. There was no morbidity, regardless of the treatment performed. All the patients experienced neurological improvement after treatment. Conclusions No specific clinical or radiological characteristic of PMAVFs in the pediatric population was observed when our series was compared with a general series. Early diagnosis and timing of the therapeutic intervention seemed to avoid the development of irreversible ischemic myeloradiculopathy and prevented hemorrhage.

40|$|Background and Purpose—The {{rarity of}} spinal dural {{arteriovenous}} fistulae makes physicians often overlook this potential diagnosis {{in patients with}} progressive gait disturbance and paraparesis. Consequently, patients with spinal dural arteriovenous fistulae can gradually become completely paraplegic if the final diagnosis is delayed considerably. The objective {{of the current study}} is to demonstrate that, particularly in patients with paraplegia, surgical treatment of fistula is necessary and often has a favorable outcome. Methods—Of 42 patients with spinal dural arteriovenous fistulae treated in our institution (surgery or endovascular treatment), 6 were paraplegic preoperatively (Grade IV on the McCormick scale and Grade V on the Aminoff scale, Grade 5 of modified Rankin Scale with motor ASIA between 0 and 10 for both lower limbs).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Spinal {{arteriovenous}} malformations (AVMs) {{can lead}} to development of congestive myelopathy (Foix-Alajouanine syndrome). Spinal AVMs are rare and so is this syndrome. Diagnosis is often missed due to its rarity and confusing definitions of the Foix-Alajouanine syndrome. CASE REPORT: We report {{a case of a}} 47 -year-old male patient suffering from this rare syndrome with an AVM arising from the artery of Adamkiewicz, which is another rarity. Our patient was treated by embolization of the lesion with 20 % glue, after which he showed mild improvement of symptoms. We also present a brief review of literature on spinal AVMs and elucidate the evolution of the term Foix-Alajouanine syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the term "Foix-Alajouanine syndrome" should be restricted to patients with progressive subacute to chronic neurological symptoms due to congestive myelopathy caused by intradural <b>spinal</b> AVMs. CT <b>angiography</b> should supplement DSA as preliminary Imaging modality.

40|$|Study Design. A {{case report}} and a {{discussion}} of recent published data. Objective. To highlight the importance of vertebral hemangioma (VH) as a differential diagnosis {{in the evaluation of}} locally aggressive spinal lesions. Summary of Background Data. VH commonly occur as incidental findings, however, locally aggressive VH have been described. Difficulties in diagnosing these lesions are well reported and relate to changes in fat content causing uncharacteristic appearances on imaging. The management options for these lesions include a combination of observation, embolization, sclerotherapy, surgical decompression, or stabilization and radiotherapy. Methods. A 45 -year-old patient who was previously well presented with back pain and rapidly progressive paraparesis. Imaging confirmed the presence of an extensive lesion centered within the right T 3 vertebral pedicle with intrusion into the spinal canal. Urgent surgical decompression was undertaken and was complicated by extensive intraoperative hemorrhage requiring massive transfusion. Results. Histologically, the lesion was shown to be a cavernous VH with no evidence of malignancy. Following radiation oncology review, he was offered adjuvant radiotherapy to minimize the risks of recurrence. He achieved a near full neurologic recovery within 2 weeks and had a full recovery by 12 months. Conclusion. VH should be considered in the evaluation of locally aggressive <b>spinal</b> lesions. <b>Angiography</b> is a useful adjunct in the evaluation of these lesions, both as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. After diagnosed correctly a wide range of treatment options exist that may prevent the patient from undergoing major surgical resection and reconstruction procedures, which may be associated with high rates of morbidity.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{detection}} and localization of spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) remain diagnostic challenges. This study tested {{the hypothesis that}} elliptic centric contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) {{can be used to}} detect spinal dural AVFs, predict the level of fistulas, and reduce the radiation dose and volume of iodinated contrast material associated with conventional angiography. METHODS: We examined 31 patients who presented with suspected spinal dural AVF between December 2000 and March 2004. All patients underwent MRA and conventional angiography. The effect of MRA on subsequent conventional angiography was assessed by analyzing total fluoroscopy time and volume of iodinated contrast material used. RESULTS: At <b>angiography,</b> <b>spinal</b> dural AVFs were diagnosed in 22 of 31 patients, and MRA depicted an AVF in 20 of the 22 patients.

40|$|SUMMARY: Novel {{developments}} in MR angiography are reviewed that enable non-invasive clinical imaging of normal and abnormal vessels of {{the spinal cord}}. Current fast contrast-enhanced MR techniques are able 1) to visualize vessels supplying or draining the spinal cord and 2) to differentiate spinal cord arteries from veins. The localization of the Adamkiewicz artery, the largest artery supplying the thoracolumbar spinal cord, has become possible in a reproducible and reliable manner. Knowledge of the anatomic location of this artery and its arterial supplier may be of benefit in the work-up for aortic aneurysm surgery to reduce incidences of ischemic injury. <b>Spinal</b> cord MR <b>angiography</b> is ready to become a diagnostic tool that can compete with catheter angiography for detecting and localizing arterial feeders of vascular lesions and is strongly advised for use prior to invasive catheter angiogra-phy. Successful clinical application strongly relies on in depth knowledge of the complex spinal cord vasculature and skills in image postprocessing. Due to their small calibers, clinical imaging of spinal cordarteries and veins was until recently only possible using catheter angiography. MR imaging {{by virtue of its}} strong soft tissue contrast is widely applied in patients suspected of har-boring spinal vascular abnormalities. Using MR imaging i...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Experience with {{magnetic}} resonance imaging in 22 patients with diseases of the spinal cord is reported. Important additional diagnostic information as compared to conventionai neuroradiological techniques (myelography, spinal CT) was gained especially in cases of hyd-rosyringomyelia, intraspinal tumour and multiple sclerosis. It is suggested that magnetic reso-nance imaging may become the method of choice in the diagnosis of structural spinal cord diseases. Diagnosis of diseases of the spinal cord is based on clinical findings and {{on the results of}} a variety of complementary examinations. The latter currently include CSF analysis, somatosensory evoked poten-tials, myelography, myeloscintigraphy, spinal com-puted tomography (CT) and <b>spinal</b> digitalised sub-traction <b>angiography.</b> Despite this array of sophis-ticated diagnostic techniques the differential diag-nosis of spinal cord lesions cannot be clarified in many instances, or is only established at operation, or on post mortem examination. With the advent of nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI), tomograms of soft tissue structures have become possible. '- 4 The ability to visualise the spinal cord in vivo makes MRI of special value for the diagnosis of spinal cord diseases. 5 - 8 The exact craniocaudal extent of a medullary lesion can be determined using sagittal and coronary scans. The precise localisation of a spinal cord lesion requires imaging of very high resolution. This can be achieved by MRI by using zooming techniques, sur-face coils and reduction of slice thickness to a few millimeters without any loss of optimal image qual-ity. Thus MRI has become the first non-invasive procedure not only to determine the exact localisa-tion and expansion of a pathological medullary con...|$|R
