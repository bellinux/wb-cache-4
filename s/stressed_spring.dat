The mechanical design of low spring-constant folded-suspension beams is presented first, and switches using these beams are demonstrated with measured actuation voltages of as low as 6 V. Furthermore, common nonidealities such as residual in-plane and gradient stress, as well as down-state stiction problems are addressed, and possible solutions are discussed. Finally, both experimental and theoretical data for the dynamic behavior of these devices are presented.

The breech of the gun is semi-automatic and fitted with a vertical sliding wedge breech block. The firing mechanism utilises a mechanical firing pin which was prone to sticking and malfunction in dusty climates.

40|$|Abstract. Twenty {{springs in}} the Lake Havasu man-agement {{area of the}} BLM have been {{evaluated}} for their geologic, biologic, and archaeologic charac-teristics. Water from active springs eventually flows into Lake Havasu or the Colorado River south of Parker Dam. This region is geologically complex, containing many rock types that {{have been subjected to}} tectonic extensional <b>stresses.</b> <b>Springs</b> emanate from rocks as diverse as gneiss, rhyolite, diabase, volcanic breccia, and fanglomer-ate. The geologic control for water migration at these springs falls into one of four conduit types: fault controlled, fracture systems within crystalline rocks, bedding contact between a more permeable layer and overlying impermeable layer, and cross-cutting contact (dike intrusions). All springs lie within drainage channels seeping either from the channel walls or base. Some springs are perennial and some are seasonally active after a series of heavy precipitation events, indicating variations in residence times and extent of subsurface connec-tivity. Two springs were still inactive after several months of higher than normal rainfall in 2004. Total hardness content of spring water varies from 39 to more than 1200 mg / 1, mostly as calcium. Caliche occurs as stains on bedrock or as accumu-lations of microcrystalline powder within alluvium at nearly all the springs. Unexpected elevated nitrogen- nitrate levels, as high as 24. 7 mg/ 1, are present in some of these backcountry spring waters. The source of the nitrate is speculative, but it may have been deposited by eolian action from playas to the west in the Mojave Desert...|$|R

In aftermarket high performance valve spring applications, the need for controlled and multi-step shot peening is a requirement to withstand extreme surface stresses that sometimes exceeds material specifications.

40|$|The {{time series}} of total solar {{irradiance}} (TSI) satellite observations since 1978 provided by ACRIM and PMOD TSI composites are studied. We find empirical evidence for planetary-induced forcing and modulation of solar activity. Power spectra and direct data pattern analysis reveal a clear {{signature of the}} 1. 09 -year Earth-Jupiter conjunction cycle, in particular during solar cycle 23 maximum. This appears {{to suggest that the}} Jupiter side of the Sun is slightly brighter during solar maxima. The effect is observed when the Earth crosses the Sun-Jupiter conjunction line every 1. 09 years. Multiple spectral peaks are observed in the TSI records that are coherent with known planetary harmonics such as the spring, orbital and synodic periods among Mercury, Venus, Earth and Jupiter: the Mercury-Venus spring-tidal cycle (0. 20 year); the Mercury orbital cycle (0. 24 year); the Venus-Jupiter spring-tidal cycle (0. 32 year); the Venus-Mercury synodic cycle (0. 40 year); the Venus-Jupiter synodic cycle (0. 65 year); and the Venus-Earth spring tidal cycle (0. 80 year). Strong evidence is also found for a 0. 5 -year TSI cycle that could be driven by the Earth's crossing the solar equatorial plane twice a year and may indicate a latitudinal solar-luminosity asymmetry. Because both spring and synodic planetary cycles appear to be present and the amplitudes of their TSI signatures appear enhanced during sunspot cycle maxima, we conjecture that on annual and sub-annual scales both gravitational and electro-magnetic planet-sun interactions and internal non-linear feedbacks may be modulating solar activity. Gravitational tidal forces should mostly <b>stress</b> <b>spring</b> cycles while electro-magnetic forces could be linked to the solar wobbling dynamics, and would mostly stress the synodic cycles.

Proline accumulation proved to be a more sensitive indicator of water stress compared to TTC, showing significant increases with both the withholding of water and PEG as methods to induce water stress. Although both methods of stress induction proved to be effective, the withholding of water may be more appropriate due to the possibility of root injuries with PEG. Good control of climatic conditions and measurements of plant water potential will, however, be essential if the withholding of water is used to induce stress. Articl...|$|R
40|$|With the {{advancement}} of solution techniques and solving computers, 3 D analysis of civil engineering problems has increasingly become more interesting. The multiple spring model {{is one of the}} tools to give good solutions to 3 D liquefaction analyses. In this model, the deviatoric stress is determined in a finite number of springs distributed over virtual planes in the soil element for which liquefaction analysis is to be undergone. Among the several options for the distribution of the virtual planes in the soil element, it was previously found that an icosahedral distribution results in an isotropic model. For the displacement based analysis {{which is going to be}} discussed in this report, the global strains will be decomposed into one-dimensional strains in each spring through transformation matrices. Then the Masing rule after several modifications will be used to obtain stress ratio from those transformed strains. The product of the stress ratio and the mean effective stress gives the shear <b>stress</b> in each <b>spring.</b> The global shear stress of the soil mass is calculated from the shear <b>stress</b> in each <b>spring</b> through transformation matrices. The model also uses stress-dilatancy relationships to calculate volumetric strain due to dilatancy which enables to calculate the volumetric strain due to consolidation. Expressions for a curve of isotropic compression or swelling help to calculate the mean effective stress. Along with the stress ratio, it is this mean effective stress that will be used to calculate the shear <b>stress</b> in each <b>spring.</b> In this report, it is discovered that the icosahedral distribution of planes results in an isotropic behavior. However, the way the springs are oriented on those plane as described in the original model by Nishimura (2002) will not result in an isotropic behavior. At the end of the report, suggestions will be given to overcome this anisotropy. It will also be seen that the volumetric strain due to dilatancy is overestimated in the model. The source for the overestimation is discovered and will be forwarded for further improvement.

The less negative osmotic potential of the forced fruit (- 3 to - 2 Psipi) indicates less water <b>stress</b> under <b>spring</b> cover compared with field-grown fruit (- 4 Psipi), as confirmed by the larger fruit size and weight.

We hypothesized that earlier snowmelt would negatively affect the performance of tree seedlings near the treeline due to higher <b>spring</b> <b>stress</b> levels, but less so if seedlings were protected from the main stress factors of night frosts and excess solar radiation. We exposed seedlings of five European treeline tree species: Larix decidua, Picea abies, Pinus cembra, Pinus uncinata, and Sorbus aucuparia to two snow-cover treatments (early and late melting, with about two weeks difference) combined with reduced sky exposure during the day (shading) or night (night warming), repeated in two years, at a site about 200 m below the regional treeline elevation. Physiological stress levels (as indicated by lower Fv/Fm) in the first weeks after emergence from snow were higher in early-emerging seedlings. As expected, shade reduced stress, but contrary to expectation, night warming did not. However, early- and late-emerging seedlings did not differ overall in their growth or survival, and the interaction with shading was inconsistent between years. Overall, shading had the strongest effect, decreasing stress levels and mortality (in the early-emerging seedlings only), but also growth. A two-week difference in snow-cover duration did not strongly affect the seedlings, although even smaller differences {{have been shown to}} affect productivity in alpine and arctic tundra vegetation. Still, snowmelt timing cannot be discarded as important for regeneration in subalpine conditions, because (1) it is likely more critical in very snow-rich or snow-poor mountains or landscape positions; and (2) it can change (sub) alpine vegetation phenology and productivity, thereby affecting plant interactions, an aspect that should be considered in future studies...|$|R
