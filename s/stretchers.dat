5|$|Those {{with more}} serious {{injuries}} {{had to be}} carried down the track. The usual {{decision as to whether}} it was safe to move someone was simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took eight or ten Papuan carriers to move each man. Army <b>stretchers</b> rotted and fell apart; the Papuans improvised <b>stretchers</b> from blankets, copra bags and timber cut along the Track. The pace of the withdrawal was dictated by the rate at which casualties could be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|The main façade (south elevation) of Literary Hall {{is divided}} into three bays, and its west and east {{elevations}} are divided into five bays. Each of the building's bays consists of a double-hung sash wooden window, with nine panes of glass within each sash. The windows are symmetrically placed within recessed brick panels that are defined at the first and second stories of the building with elementary brick ribs, or pseudo-pilasters, that form the outer surface of the building's exterior walls and provide separation of the three bays of the main façade and the five bays of the west and east elevations. The windows are framed by white wooden louvered window shutters. The building's brick is laid in an American bond pattern, with five courses of <b>stretchers</b> between every course of headers.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{transport}} operations, the Hercules flew many evacuation flights out of Vietnam {{to transfer}} wounded or sick personnel to Australia, via Butterworth, for further treatment. These flights were initially conducted {{as part of}} the regular courier service, and the patients and RAAF nurses had to endure uncomfortable conditions as the aircraft had only rudimentary facilities for personnel on <b>stretchers.</b> Separate evacuation flights began on 1July 1966, and continued at fortnightly intervals until 1972; more flights were made during periods in which 1ATF suffered heavy casualties. Although the operation was generally successful, only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967 after an article criticising the use of noisy C-130As to transport wounded personnel was published in The Medical Journal of Australia. The C-130Es provided much more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia when required. A total of 3,164patients had been transported to Australia by the time the C-130 evacuation flights ended in early 1972. The Hercules also returned the bodies of servicemen killed in Vietnam to Australia.|$|E

50|$|A foot arch <b>stretcher</b> (also {{known as}} a foot <b>stretcher,</b> arch <b>stretcher,</b> pointe <b>stretcher,</b> toe <b>stretcher,</b> or arch enhancer) is a device used {{in the fields of}} ballet, dance, gymnastics, cheerleading, and other {{athletics}} in order to stretch the arches of the foot. It is believed that regular use of a foot arch <b>stretcher</b> may increase flexibility in the arch, ankle, and metatarsal areas of the foot.

5|$|As {{part of the}} storyline angle, Rated-RKO {{attacked}} Ric Flair {{with steel}} chairs to enrage DX on November 27. At New Year's Revolution in January 2007, Rated-RKO faced DX in a title defense, but the match was declared a no-contest when Triple H suffered a legitimate injury during the match. At Royal Rumble, Edge competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match where he lasted the longest in the match {{with a time of}} 44:02 and eliminated 5 men and made it to the final 4 in the match before getting eliminated by Shawn Michaels, With Triple H out of action, the team continued their on-screen rivalry with remaining DX member Shawn Michaels. Michaels teamed with John Cena to defeat Rated-RKO for the tag team championship on January 29, 2007. Edge and Orton suffered a series of losses to Cena and Michaels in the following months, In April 2007, Edge competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 23. During the match, Matt Hardy threw him onto a ladder and encouraged Jeff Hardy, who was close to the winning briefcase, to finish him off. Hardy then leaped off the 20-foot-high (6.1 m) ladder, and drove him through the ladder with a leg drop, seemingly injuring both Edge & himself. The two were unable to continue the match and were removed from ringside on <b>stretchers.</b> After this Edge and Orton also became rivals in their goals of achieving the WWE Championship. Neither Edge nor Orton won the championship, and they lost their claims as number one contenders after a failed match with Cena at Backlash in April.|$|E
5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on <b>stretchers.</b> One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E
5|$|Seeing Arnaud felled by gunfire, Magruder, who {{was wearing}} body armor, stepped back and drew her sidearm. However, before she could return fire, Logan then shot six bullets at her, one of which struck her in the head, mortally {{wounding}} her. Logan then went over to Arnaud and, while standing over his body, shot him four more times, injuring his liver and inducing severe internal bleeding. Arnaud would die from severe gunshot-induced blood loss at the scene, but the mortally wounded Magruder was able to call for assistance over her radio at 9:34p.m. Logan's father, {{who was in the}} house's master bedroom, had heard the gunshots, and thinking that the deputies had shot him, went over to see what had happened. Instead, he saw Logan leaving the house with a firearm in hand, and saw that the two deputies had been shot. Logan's father then called 9-1-1 via telephone at 9:39p.m. to report the shooting to authorities. Emergency medical technicians arrived and removed Arnaud and Magruder were removed from the house via <b>stretchers,</b> with Magruder being airlifted via medical helicopter to the Prince George's Hospital Center, with CPR being applied on her while en route. However, she would be pronounced dead at the hospital before midnight.|$|E

50|$|The method with a {{flexible}} <b>stretcher</b> {{was inspired by}} the method used to change the sheets of an impotent patient at the hospital. The flexible <b>stretcher</b> is placed beside the casualty, and a sheet is put on it. The third of the <b>stretcher</b> that is the closest to the casualty is folded on the middle third. The casualty is first rolled away from the <b>stretcher,</b> and the <b>stretcher</b> is slid {{against the back of the}} casualty. Then the casualty is put on his/her back and rolled on the other side; the <b>stretcher</b> and the sheet are unfolded. The casualty is wrapped into the sheet, and can be lifted with the handles of the flexible <b>stretcher.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The scoop <b>stretcher</b> is {{used for}} lifting patients, for {{instance}} from the ground onto an ambulance <b>stretcher</b> or onto a spinal board. The two ends of the <b>stretcher</b> can be detached from each other, splitting the <b>stretcher</b> into two longitudinal halves. To load a patient, one or {{both ends of the}} <b>stretcher</b> are detached, the halves placed under the patient from either side and fastened back together. With obese patients, the possibility exists of accidentally pinching the patient's back when closing the <b>stretcher,</b> so care must be made not to injure them when carrying out this procedure.|$|R

5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a <b>Stretcher</b> match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam, {{in which the}} object is to place your {{opponent}} on a <b>stretcher</b> and wheel the <b>stretcher</b> across a finish line. The match went back and forth before Van Dam attempted to perform a Somersault Plancha onto Orton, but Orton moved out of the way. Orton put Van Dam on the <b>stretcher</b> and tried to wheel him across the finishing line. Van Dam, however, managed to kick Orton in the head and put him onto the <b>stretcher.</b> Van Dam wheeled the <b>stretcher</b> over the line for the win. After the match, Orton attacked Van Dam, executing an Elevated DDT off the barricade onto the arena floor. Van Dam was then carried out of the arena on the <b>stretcher.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Nimier <b>stretcher</b> (brancard Nimier) was {{a type of}} <b>stretcher</b> used by the French army during World War I.

25|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{construct}} compressors and <b>stretchers.</b> However, a typical Ti:sapphire-based chirped-pulse amplifier requires that the pulses are stretched to several hundred picoseconds, which means that the different wavelength components must experience about 10cm difference in path length. The most practical way to achieve this is with grating-based <b>stretchers</b> and compressors. <b>Stretchers</b> and compressors are characterized by their dispersion. With negative dispersion, light with higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) takes less time to travel through the device than light with lower frequencies (longer wavelengths). With positive dispersion, it is the other way around. In a CPA, the dispersions of the stretcher and compressor should cancel out. Because of practical considerations, the stretcher is usually designed with positive dispersion and the compressor with negative dispersion.|$|E
