40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{prevalence}} of legal and illegal <b>stimulants</b> in relation to doping-control analysis. <b>Stimulants</b> are among the oldest classes of doping agents, having been used since ancient times. Despite {{the ease with which}} they can be detected and the availability of sensitive detection methods, <b>stimulants</b> are still popular among athletes. Indeed, they remain one of the top three most popular classes of prohibited substances. Because the list of legal and illegal <b>stimulants</b> is extensive only a selection is discussed in detail. The compounds selected are caffeine, ephedrines, amphetamine and related compounds, methylphenidate, cocaine, strychnine, modafinil, adrafinil, 4 -methyl- 2 -hexaneamine, and sibutramine. These compounds are mainly prevalent in sport or are of therapeutic importance. Because <b>stimulants</b> are the oldest doping class the first detection methods were for this group. Several early detection techniques including GC-NPD, GC-ECD, and TLC are highlighted. The more novel detection techniques GC-MS and LC-MS are also discussed in detail. In particular, the last technique has been shown to enable successful detection of <b>stimulants</b> difficult to detect by GC-MS or for <b>stimulants</b> previously undetectable. Because <b>stimulants</b> are also regularly detected in nutritional (food) supplements a section on this topic is also included...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Stimulants</b> improve {{focus and}} alertness. Low (therapeutic) doses of dopaminergic <b>stimulants</b> (e.g., reuptake inhibitors and {{releasing}} agents) also promote cognitive and athletic performance, as nootropics and ergogenic aids respectively, by improving muscle {{strength and endurance}} while decreasing reaction time and fatigue; some examples of athletic performance-enhancing <b>stimulants</b> are caffeine, ephedrine, methylphenidate, and amphetamine.|$|R
5|$|Ephedrine: Ephedrine, {{known as}} ma huang in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine, originally as an extract of the herb Ephedra sinica, {{has been documented}} in China since the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) as an antiasthmatic and <b>stimulant.</b> The industrial manufacture of ephedrine in China began in the 1920s, when the American pharmaceutical company Merck began marketing and selling the drug as ephetonin. Ephedrine exports between China and the West grew from 4 tonnes to 216 tonnes between 1926 and 1928.|$|E

To Hamilton, the proper handling of the government debt would also allow America to borrow at affordable interest rates and would also be a <b>stimulant</b> to the economy.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone {{is often}} {{consumed}} with alcohol. A study in mice investigated the interrelation {{between these two}} substances, focusing on the psychostimulant and rewarding properties of mephedrone. It found that at low (non <b>stimulant)</b> doses alcohol significantly enhanced the psychostimulant effects of mephedrone. This effect was mediated {{by an increase in}} synaptic dopamine, as haloperidol, but not ketanserin, was able to block the potentiation by alcohol. Similarly, the rewarding properties of mephedrone were enhanced by a low non-rewarding dose of alcohol.|$|E
50|$|One {{approach}} of athletes {{to get around}} regulations on <b>stimulants</b> is to use new designer <b>stimulants,</b> which have not previously been officially prohibited, but have similar chemical structures or biological effects. Designer <b>stimulants</b> that attracted media attention in 2010 included mephendrone, ephendrome, and fluoroamphetamines; which have chemical structures and effects similar to ephedrine and amphetamine.|$|R
40|$|The {{swallowtail}} butterfly, Papilio xuthus, selectively uses {{a limited}} number of plants in the Rutaceae family. The butterfly detects oviposition <b>stimulants</b> in leaves through foreleg chemosensilla and requires a specific combination of multiple oviposition <b>stimulants</b> to lay eggs on the leaf of its host plants. In this study, we sought to elucidate the mechanism underlying the regulation of oviposition behavior by multiple oviposition <b>stimulants.</b> We classified chemosensilla on the tarsomere of the foreleg into three types (L 1, L 2, and S) according to their size and response to oviposition <b>stimulants</b> and general tastants. The L 1 was more abundant in females than in males and responded preferentially to oviposition <b>stimulants.</b> Both L 2 and S were common to both sexes and responded to general tastants. We found that five oviposition <b>stimulants</b> (synephrine, stachydrine, 5 -hydroxy-N omega-methyltryptamine, narirutin, and chiro-inositol) elicited spikes from three specific gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) within L 1 sensilla. These three GRNs responded to a mixture of the five <b>stimulants</b> at concentrations equivalent to those found in the whole-leaf extract of citrus, and the mixture induced oviposition at levels comparable to whole-leaf extract. We propose that oviposition is triggered by the firing of three specific GRNs in L 1 sensilla that encode the chemical signatures of multiple oviposition <b>stimulants...</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{chemical}} germination <b>stimulants.</b> Strigol {{was the first of the}} germination <b>stimulants</b> to be isolated. It was isolated from a non-host cotton plant and has been found in true host plants such as corn and millets. The <b>stimulants</b> are usually plant specific, examples of other germination <b>stimulants</b> include sorgolactone from sorghum, orobanchol and alectrol from red clover, and 5-deoxystrigol from Lotus japonicas. Strigolactones are apocarotenoids that are produced via the carotenoid pathway of plants. Strigolactones and mycorrhizal fungi have a relationship in which Strigolactone also cues the growth of mycorrhizal fungus.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle <b>stimulant,</b> and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine as a {{manufactured}} {{medication is}} sold under the trade names Intropin, Dopastat, and Revimine, among others. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is most commonly used as a <b>stimulant</b> drug {{in the treatment of}} severe low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and cardiac arrest. It is especially important in treating these in newborn infants. It is given intravenously. Since the half-life of dopamine in plasma is very short—approximately one minute in adults, two minutes in newborn infants and up to five minutes in preterm infants—it is usually given in a continuous intravenous drip rather than a single injection.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been able to sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the <b>stimulant</b> benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stimulants</b> in {{therapeutic}} doses, such {{as those}} given to patients with ADHD, increases ability to focus, vigor, sociability, libido and may elevate mood. However, in higher doses <b>stimulants</b> may actually decrease the ability to focus, a principle of the Yerkes-Dodson Law. In higher doses <b>stimulants</b> may also produce euphoria, vigor, and decrease need for sleep. Many, but not all, <b>stimulants</b> have ergogenic effects. Drugs such as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, amphetamine and methylphenidate have well documented ergogenic effects, while drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine have the opposite effect. [...] Neurocognitive enhancing effects of <b>stimulants,</b> specifically modafinil, amphetamine and methylphenidate have been documented in healthy adolescents, and is a commonly cited reason among illicit drug users for use, particularly among college students {{in the context of}} studying.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to <b>stimulant</b> effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a <b>stimulant</b> in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Medication is {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when <b>stimulant</b> trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, {{systematic}} medical {{reviews and}} meta-analyses of clinical research in humans established consensus that certain <b>stimulants,</b> only when used at low (therapeutic) concentrations, unambiguously enhance cognition {{in the general}} population; in particular, the classes of <b>stimulants</b> that demonstrate cognition-enhancing effects in humans act as direct agonists or indirect agonists of dopamine receptor D1, adrenoceptor A2, or both receptors in the prefrontal cortex.

5|$|Metallic lead beads {{dating back}} to 7000–6500 BCE {{have been found in}} Asia Minor and may {{represent}} the first example of metal smelting. At that time lead had few (if any) applications due to its softness and dull appearance. The major reason for the spread of lead production was its association with silver, which may be obtained by burning galena (a common lead mineral). The Ancient Egyptians were the first to use lead minerals in cosmetics, an application that spread to Ancient Greece and beyond; the Egyptians may have used lead for sinkers in fishing nets, glazes, glasses, enamels, and for ornaments. Various civilizations of the Fertile Crescent used lead as a writing material, as currency, and for construction. Lead was used in the Ancient Chinese royal court as a <b>stimulant,</b> as currency, and as a contraceptive; the Indus Valley civilization and the Mesoamericans used it for making amulets; and the eastern and southern African peoples used lead in wire drawing.|$|E

50|$|Abuse {{of central}} nervous system (CNS) <b>stimulants</b> is common. Addiction to some CNS <b>stimulants</b> can quickly lead to medical, psychiatric, and psychosocial deterioration. Drug tolerance, dependence, and {{sensitization}} {{as well as a}} withdrawal syndrome can occur.|$|R
50|$|However, many <b>stimulants</b> possess {{addictive}} properties, which {{result in}} a high potential for substance abuse.

50|$|Psychostimulants, such as cocaine, amphetamines, methylphenidate, caffeine, and nicotine, produce {{improvements}} in {{physical and mental}} functioning, including increased energy and feelings of euphoria. <b>Stimulants</b> tend {{to be used by}} individuals who experience depression, to reduce anhedonia and increase self-esteem. The SMH also hypothesizes that hyperactive and hypomanic individuals use <b>stimulants</b> to maintain their restlessness and heighten euphoria. Additionally, <b>stimulants</b> are useful to individuals with social anxiety by helping individuals break through their inhibitions.|$|R
25|$|Tolerance to the {{therapeutic}} effects of stimulants can occur, and rebound of symptoms may {{occur when the}} dose wears off.

40|$|Multidrug use is well {{documented}} among nonmedical users of prescription <b>stimulants.</b> We sought to {{provide insight into the}} drug use patterns of those reporting nonmedical use of prescription attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) <b>stimulants</b> in an attempt to dis-cern whether such use is a first step in a pattern of drug-abusing behavior or, conversely, is a later development accompanied or preceded by a history of drug abuse. A cross-sectional, population-based survey of the U. S. civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 12 years and older was analyzed for lifetime nonmedical use of prescription ADHD <b>stimulants,</b> life-time nonmedical use of another prescription drug, illicit drug use, and drug use initiation patterns. This included 443, 041 respondents from the 2002 – 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Lifetime nonmedical use of prescription ADHD <b>stimulants</b> was reported by 3. 4 % of those aged 12 years and older. Of these, 95. 3 % also reported use of an illicit drug (i. e., marijuana, cocaine/crack, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants) or nonmedical use of another prescription drug (i. e., tranquilizers, pain relievers, or sedatives), and such use pre-ceded nonmedical use of prescription ADHD <b>stimulants</b> in 77. 6 % of cases. On average, 2. 40 drugs were used prior to the first nonmedical use of prescription ADHD <b>stimulants.</b> These data suggest that nonmedical use of prescription ADHD <b>stimulants</b> is not commonly an initi-ating factor leading to the nonmedical use of other prescription medications or abuse of illicit drugs. Rather, nonmedical use of prescription ADHD <b>stimulants</b> appears to be adopted by individuals already engaged in broader patterns of drug abuse and misuse...|$|R
40|$|This review {{examines}} the pharmacology of <b>stimulants</b> prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). <b>Stimulants</b> that increase alertness/reduce fatigue or activate the cardiovascular system can include drugs like ephedrine available in many over-the-counter medicines. Others such as amphetamines, cocaine and hallucinogenic drugs, available on prescription or illegally, can modify mood. A total of 62 <b>stimulants</b> (61 chemical entities) {{are listed in}} the WADA List, prohibited in competition. Athletes may have <b>stimulants</b> in their body for one of three main reasons: inadvertent consumption in a propriety medicine; deliberate consumption for misuse as a recreational drug and deliberate consumption to enhance performance. The majority of <b>stimulants</b> on the list act on the monoaminergic systems: adrenergic (sympathetic, transmitter noradrenaline), dopaminergic (transmitter dopamine) and serotonergic (transmitter serotonin, 5 -HT). Sympathomimetic describes agents, which mimic sympathetic responses, and dopaminomimetic and serotoninomimetic can be used to describe actions on the dopamine and serotonin systems. However, many agents act to mimic more than one of these monoamines, so that a collective term of monoaminomimetic may be useful. Monoaminomimietic actions of <b>stimulants</b> can include blockade of re-uptake of neurotransmitter, indirect release of neurotransmitter, direct activation of monoaminergic receptors. Many of the <b>stimulants</b> are amphetamines or amphetamine derivatives, including agents with abuse potential as recreational drugs. A number of agents are metabolized to amphetamine or metamphetamine. In addition to the monoaminomimetic agents, a small number of agents with different modes of action are on the list. A number of commonly used <b>stimulants</b> are not considered as Prohibited Substances...|$|R
