50|$|The JTS engine (<b>Jet</b> <b>Thrust</b> Stoichiometric) is a {{gasoline}} direct injection engine produced by Alfa Romeo. It exists in two forms, straight-4 and V6, and was introduced into the Alfa lineup in 2002.|$|R
5000|$|For {{vertical}} take-off, hovering, low-speed flight, {{and vertical}} landing, the main rotor wing {{was driven by}} tip jets, by directing the exhaust from a <b>jet</b> engine through <b>thrust</b> nozzles in the rotor tips. Because the rotor is driven directly by <b>jet</b> <b>thrust,</b> {{there is no need}} for a tail rotor to control torque as in a conventional helicopter.|$|R
50|$|Besides the helicopter, {{there are}} two types of VTOL {{aircraft}} in military service: craft using a tiltrotor, such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, and some aircraft using directed <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> such as the Harrier family.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{the results of}} an experimental investigation into the effects induced by a deflected jet upon the body from which it issues. The tests were performed at a Reynolds number of 0. 3 x 10 (6) based on body diameter and maximum tunnel velocity. It was found that a side force and moment were induced upon the afterbody, the magnitude of which increased with jet deflection and <b>jet</b> <b>thrust.</b> The direction of the induced side force was in a direction opposite to the normal component of the thrust vector.

50|$|The {{coleopter}} type has an annular wing {{forming a}} duct around a lift rotor. The transition to forward flight {{has never been}} achieved, although the SNECMA Coléoptère took off, hovered and landed vertically, solely on pure <b>jet</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the exclusive jet mass distribution in e+e- events, defined with a veto on the out-of-jet radiation, at two-loop order. In particular, we calculate the two-loop soft function, which {{is required to}} describe this distribution in the threshold region. When combined with other ingredients using soft-collinear effective theory, this generates the complete singular distribution for <b>jet</b> <b>thrust,</b> {{the sum of the}} jet masses, at two-loop order. The result is in excellent agreement with full QCD. The integrated <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> distribution is found to depend in an intricate way on both the finite jet cone size, R, and the jet veto scale. The result clarifies the structure of the potentially large logarithms (both global and non- global) which arise in jet observables {{for the first time at}} this order. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that, in the small R limit, there is a precise and simple correspondence between the non-global contribution to the integrated <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> distribution and the previously calculated non-global contribution to the integrated hemisphere soft function, including subleading terms. This suggests that the small R limit may provide a useful expansion for studying other exclusive jet substructure observables. Comment: 36 pages, 4 Figure...|$|R
50|$|In 1954 FIAT {{unveiled}} a concept {{car with a}} turbine engine, called Fiat Turbina. This vehicle, looking like an aircraft with wheels, used a unique combination of both <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> and the engine driving the wheels. Speeds of 175 mph were claimed.|$|R

50|$|Tail-sitters were {{otherwise}} conventional aeroplanes which sat pointing vertically {{up while}} on the ground and, after takeoff, tilted the whole aircraft horizontal to fly forwards.

50|$|The orbiter {{continues}} to perform well. The only problem reported {{during the day}} was {{the failure of a}} primary reaction control system jet.

50|$|Turboshaft {{engines are}} very similar to turboprops, differing in that nearly all energy in the exhaust is {{extracted}} to spin the rotating shaft, which is used to power machinery rather than a propeller, they therefore generate little to no <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> and are often used to power helicopters.|$|R

Full vortex lift was achieved at the inboard span station with a small blowing rate, but successively higher blowing rates were necessary to achieve full vortex lift at increased span distances. It is shown that spanwise blowing increases lift throughout the angle-of-attack range, delays wing stall to higher angles of attack, and improves the induced-drag polars. The leading-edge suction analogy can be used to estimate the section and total lifts resulting from spanwise blowing...|$|R

40|$|In this work, we {{complete}} {{the calculation of}} the soft part of the two-loop integrated <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> distribution in e + e − annihilation. This jet mass observable {{is based on the}} <b>thrust</b> cone <b>jet</b> algorithm, which involves a veto scale for out-of-jet radiation. The previously uncomputed part of our result depends in a complicated way on the jet cone size, r, and at intermediate stages of the calculation we actually encounter a new class of multiple polylogarithms. We employ an extension of the coproduct calculus to systematically exploit functional relations and represent our results concisely. In contrast to the individual contributions, the sum of all global terms can be expressed in terms of classical polylogarithms. Our explicit two-loop calculation enables us to clarify the small r picture discussed in earlier work. In particular, we show that the resummation of the logarithms of r that appear in the previously uncomputed part of the two-loop integrated <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> distribution is inextricably linked to the resummation of the non-global logarithms. Furthermore, we find that the logarithms of r which cannot be absorbed into the non-global logarithms in the way advocated in earlier work have coefficients fixed by the two-loop cusp anomalous dimension. We also show that in many cases one can straightforwardly predict potentially large logarithmic contributions to the integrated <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> distribution at L loops by making use of analogous contributions to the simpler integrated hemisphere soft function...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of the}} 19 B- 8 and 19 XB- 1 turbojet engines and the windmilling-drag characteristics of the 19 B- 6 engine were determined in the Cleveland altitude wind tunnel. The investigations were conducted on the 19 B- 8 engine at simulated altitudes from 5000 to 25, 000 feet with various free-stream ram-pressure ratios and on the 19 XB [...] 1 engine at simulated altitudes from 5000 to 30, 000 feet with approximately static free-stream conditions. Data for these two engines are presented to show the effect of altitude, free-stream ram-pressure ratio, and tail-pipe-nozzle area on engine performance. A 21 -percent reduction in tail-pipe-nozzle area of the 19 B- 8 engine increased the let thrust 43 percent the net thrust 72 percent, and the fuel consumption 64 percent. An increase in free-stream ram-pressure ratio raised the <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> and the air flow and lowered the net thrust throughout {{the entire range of}} engine speeds for the 19 B- 8 engine. At similar operating conditions, the corrected <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> and corrected air flow were approximately the same for both engines, and the corrected specific fuel consumption based on <b>jet</b> <b>thrust</b> was lower for the 19 XB- 1 engine than for the 19 B- 8 engine.
