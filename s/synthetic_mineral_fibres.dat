40|$|Mineral fibres and {{mesothelioma}} There {{has been}} considerable recent {{interest in the}} sug-gestion that mineral fibres other than asbestos might be associated with mesotheliomas in the pleural and peritoneal cavities. Compared with the wealth of in-formation on the consequences of exposure to asbes-tos, information {{about the effects of}} other fibrous minerals is sparse and much of it is of a preliminary nature. In this editorial the relationship between fibrous minerals and mesothelioma will be considered under the following headings: (1) asbestos minerals of commercial value; (2) asbestos minerals as potential environmental contaminants; (3) naturally occurring fibrous minerals as potential environmental con-taminants; (4) <b>synthetic</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractExposure to <b>synthetic</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> (SMF) {{may occur}} {{in a number of}} {{workplace}} scenarios. To protect worker health, a number of different organisations worldwide have assessed the health risk of these materials and established workplace exposure limits. This paper outlines the basic principles of risk assessment and the scientific methods used to derive valid (justifiable) occupational exposure limits (OELs) and goes on to show how, for SMF, and particularly for refractory ceramic fibre (otherwise known as aluminosilicate wool, RCF/ASW), the methods used and the associated outcomes differ widely. It is argued that the resulting differences in established OELs prevent consistent and appropriate risk management of SMF worldwide, and that development of a transparent and harmonised approach to fibre risk assessment and limit-setting is required...|$|E
40|$|In {{relation}} to their potential genotoxic properties, the ability of inorganic particles to induce activated species of oxygen with strong oxidative properties can be studied by various methods. In this study the oxidative surface properties of 10 different natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> were investigated by: (1) an electron paramagnetic resonance technique in which formate was used to trap oxidative species; and (2) a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) based method in which deoxyguanosine {{was used as a}} trapping agent and the formation of 8 -hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8 OHdG) was analysed. Ground iron-containing fibres such as crocidolite and amosite were the most reactive, whereas fibres without iron [...] for example, ceramic fibres, xonotlite, and Tismo L [...] were completely inactive. A good correlation was found when the results from the two methods were compared (r = 0. 86) ...|$|E
50|$|A further method {{exists for}} the {{determination}} of asbestos, fibreglass, <b>synthetic</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibre</b> and ceramic <b>mineral</b> <b>fibre</b> dust in air. This is the membrane filter method (MFM) and requires {{the collection of the}} dust on a grided filter for estimation of exposure by the counting of 'conforming' fibres in 100 fields through a microscope. Results are quantified on the basis of number of fibres per millilitre of air (f/ml). Many countries strictly regulate the methodology applied to the MFM.|$|R
40|$|Health {{selection}} {{within a}} workforce {{has been found}} in several industries and appears to be more pronounced in dustier occupations. In this study of airway disease among workers exposed to asbestos and man made <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres,</b> 215 of 246 construction insulators 50 years old or less and currently working in the Montreal area were examined. Spirometry was completed successfully in 214 workers without known asbestosis and 207 underwent methacholine bronchoprovocation testing. Airway responsiveness was expressed as PC 15, the concentration of methacholine causing a 15 % fall in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). Exposure to asbestos and <b>synthetic</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibre</b> dust was estimated from the total hours of work in the trade since first employment. After the effect of age, height, and pack years of smoking had been taken into account, no relation was found between hours of work and any indices obtained from the forced expiratory manoeuvre (FEV 1 /FVC, MMF). After the effect of airway calibre (FEV 1 /FVC), age, and pack years of cigarette consumption had been taken into account, airway responsiveness decreased as the total hours of work in the trade increased. These findings suggest that workers with greater levels of airway responsiveness are more sensitive to exposure in a dusty workplace and in consequence are less likely to continue. In studies of workforces a survivor effect of this nature will tend to weaken the relation between lung function abnormality and occupational exposure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNatural fibre based {{composites}} are garnering attention {{owing to}} their optimal trade-off between mechanical properties and environmental sustainability properties. It {{has been proposed}} that they could potentially replace <b>synthetic</b> and <b>mineral</b> <b>fibre</b> composites due to their minimized impact on {{human health and the}} natural environment. Though several studies have been dedicated to understanding certain mechanical properties like strength and fatigue life, fewer reported studies have focused on their response to impact or shock loads. In the present work, we have performed shock tests using a shock tube on flax/epoxy and flax/polypropylene unidirectional and cross-ply laminated composites. The objectives are, to compare the blast-resistance of polypropylene against epoxy in their use as matrix in flaxâ€“reinforced composites, and, secondly to assess the performance of cross-ply over unidirectional fiber orientation. The present results showed that the cross-ply samples retained their structural integrity at peak pressures that were sufficient to break unidirectional samples, indicating that cross-ply samples are superior candidates for applications where shock loading needs to be factored in. Furthermore, we also qualitatively assessed the failure modes predominant in each of the studied orientations...|$|R
40|$|The {{determinants}} of respiratory symptoms were studied in an active workforce of insulation workers exposed to asbestos and <b>synthetic</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres.</b> Responses to a mailed respiratory symptom questionnaire from 537 insulation workers without diagnosed asbestosis were analysed using logistic regression. Wheezing complaints and breathlessness were related primarily to current cigarette smoking and to symptoms suggesting an asthmatic predisposition antedating {{work in the}} trade. There was also evidence that these complaints were related to occupational exposure (estimated by number of hours worked in the trade) in subjects with prior airways hyperreactivity. An asthmatic predisposition antedating work in the trade was the major determinant of acute respiratory symptoms in the workplace. The effects of workplace exposures on respiratory symptoms may have been underestimated due to selective withdrawal from the active workforce and due to inaccuracies in the measure of exposure used...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{review the}} {{scientific}} literature on {{the health effects of}} refractory ceramic fibres (RCFs). The adverse effects of exposure to asbestos has led to concern about the potential for other fibrous materials to cause diseases. For this reason the human populations most heavily exposed to <b>synthetic</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> have been examined for any adverse effects and many types of fibre have been studied in animal experiments. One type of man made vitreous fibres (MMVFs), refractory ceramic fibres (RCFs), are principally used in thermal insulation at high temperatures [...] up to 1400 degrees C. As manufactured RCFs exist in a glassy, non-crystalline (sometimes called amorphous) state, they have various compositions, physical properties, and sized fibres. METHODS [...] All reports on the health effects of RCFs available up to the end of 1994 have been examined and {{the scientific literature}} reviewed although all publications have not necessarily been referenced. CONCLUSIONS [...] In recent inhalation experiments conducted with both rats and hamsters at the Research and Consulting Company, Geneva, at the highest dose tested (30 mg/m 3) there was an increased incidence of tumours in both species. Lower doses were only examined in the rat and at these doses there was no significant excess of lung tumours. Epidemiological investigations of workers engaged in the manufacture of ceramic fibres have shown a small excess of pleural plaques. This phenomenon is being further investigated but could be due to confounding exposures. The populations available for study are small and their exposures fairly short, but it is considered prudent that they should remain under surveillance for some time to come. This is despite the fact that present exposures in the ceramic fibre industry are low (< 1 f/ml) and are being reduced...|$|E

40|$|A rapid {{method has}} been {{developed}} for measuring the binding capacity of asbestos and other <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> for environmental carcinogens. Benzo(alpha) pyrene (B(alpha) P), nitrosonornicotine (NNN), and N-acetyl- 2 -aminofluorene (NAAF) were assayed {{in the presence of}} Canadian grade 4 T 30 chrysotile, chrysotile A, amosite, crocidolite, glass microfibres, glasswool, attapulgite, and titanium dioxide. Chrysotile binds significantly more carcinogens than the other <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres.</b> This binding assay is reproducible with coefficients of variation of less than 8 % and 6 % respectively for inter and intra assay. The influence of pH was also studied, and there is good correlation between the carcinogen binding and the charge of the tested <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres.</b> The in vitro cytotoxicity on macrophage like cell line P 388 D 1 and the haemolytic activity of various <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> were also measured; a good correlation was found between the binding capacity and the cytotoxicity of tested <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> on P 388 D 1 cells.

40|$|The {{prebiotic}} {{significance of}} laboratory experiments that study {{the interactions between}} oligomeric RNA and mineral species is difficult to know. Natural exemplars of specific minerals can differ widely depending on their provenance. While laboratory-generated samples of <b>synthetic</b> <b>minerals</b> can have controlled compositions, they are often viewed as "unnatural". Here, we show how trends in the interaction of RNA with natural <b>mineral</b> specimens, <b>synthetic</b> <b>mineral</b> specimens, and co-precipitated pairs of <b>synthetic</b> <b>minerals,</b> can make a persuasive case that the observed interactions reflect {{the composition of the}} minerals themselves, rather than their being simply examples of large molecules associating nonspecifically with large surfaces. Using this approach, we have discovered Periodic Table trends in the binding of oligomeric RNA to alkaline earth carbonate minerals and alkaline earth sulfate minerals, where those trends are the same when measured in natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>minerals.</b> They are also validated by comparison of co-precipitated <b>synthetic</b> <b>minerals.</b> We also show differential binding of RNA to polymorphic forms of calcium carbonate, and the stabilization of bound RNA on aragonite.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the combined effects of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> and cigarette smoke on the production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by alveolar macrophages. Rats were exposed to cigarette smoke in vivo, and production of TNF by alveolar macrophages was measured in the presence of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> in vitro. For smoke exposure, rats were divided into two groups. Five were exposed to a daily concentration of 10 mg/m 3 of cigarette smoke for an eight hour period, and five rats (controls) were not exposed to smoke. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed after exposure to smoke and the recovered alveolar macrophages were incubated with either chrysotile or ceramic fibres on a microplate for 24 hours. Activity of TNF in the supernatant was determined by the L- 929 fibroblast cell bioassay. When alveolar macrophages were not stimulated by <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres,</b> production of TNF by rats exposed to smoke and unexposed rats was essentially the same. When alveolar macrophages were stimulated in vitro by chrysotile or ceramic fibres, production of TNF by alveolar macrophages from rats exposed to smoke was higher than that by alveolar macrophages from unexposed rats.

40|$|Although {{asbestos}} represents today one of {{the most}} harmful contaminant on Earth, in 72 % of the countries worldwide only amphiboles are banned while controlled use of chrysotile is allowed. Uncertainty on the potential toxicity of chrysotile {{is due to the fact}} that the mechanisms by which <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> induces cyto- and geno-toxic damage are still unclear. We have recently started a long term project aimed at the systematic investigation of the crystal-chemistry, bio-interaction and toxicity of the <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres.</b> This work presents a systematic structural investigation of iron in asbestos and erionite (considered the most relevant <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> of social and/or economic-industrial importance) using synchrotron X-ray absorption and MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy. In all investigated <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres,</b> iron in the bulk structure is found in octahedral sites and can be made available at the surface via fibre dissolution. We postulate that the amount of hydroxyl radicals released by the fibers depends, among other factors, upon their dissolution rate; in relation to this, a ranking of ability of asbestos fibres to generate hydroxyl radicals, resulting from available surface iron, is advanced: amosite> crocidoliteâ‰ˆchrysotile > anthophyllite > tremolite. Erionite, with a fairly high toxicity potential, contains only octahedrally coordinated Fe 3 +. Although it needs further experimental evidence, such available surface iron may be present as oxide nanoparticles coating and can be a direct cause of generation of hydroxyl radicals when such coating dissolves...|$|R
40|$|Several {{types of}} fibrous dusts have caused lung tumours and mesotheliomas in humans and/or in {{laboratory}} animals.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] Mounting {{evidence}} suggests that asbestos fibres can stimulate alveolar macrophages to generate the potent inflammatory and fibrogenic mediator, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and that this may play {{an important part in}} the onset and development of airway inflammation and lung fibrosis due to asbestos fibre inhalation. Little is known, however, about the ability of other <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> to initiate formation and release of TNF-alpha by alveolar macrophages. Therefore the effects of different fibres (crocidolite, chrysotile A, chrysotile B, two man made <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> (MMVF 21 and MMVF 22), a ceramic fibre (RCF 1), and a silicon carbide whisker fibre (SiCwh)) on formation and release of TNF-alpha by rat alveolar macrophages were examined. METHODS [...] Cells were isolated and incubated at 37 degrees C with the different fibres, or with culture medium alone (controls), and the amounts of TNF-alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) in the cells and TNF-alpha bioactivity released into the culture medium were measured at different time points. RESULTS [...] Significantly (P < 0. 05 v control) increased amounts of TNF-alpha mRNA were found in cells exposed to crocidolite, chrysotile A, chrysotile B, MMVF 21, RCF 1, or SiCwh for 90 minutes, and significantly (P < 0. 05 v control) increased activities of TNF-alpha were found in the medium of macrophages exposed to crocidolite, chrysotile A, chrysotile B, or MMVF 21 for four hours.
