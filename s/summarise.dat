5|$|Given the book's {{fluid and}} {{changeable}} approach to plot and characters, a definitive, critically agreed-upon plot synopsis remains elusive (see Critical response and themes: Difficulties of plot summary below).

40|$|This paper reviews {{research}} on automatic <b>summarising</b> {{in the last}} decade. This work has grown, stimulated by technology and by evaluation programmes. The paper uses several frameworks to organise the review, for <b>summarising</b> itself, for the factors affecting <b>summarising,</b> for systems, and for evaluation. The review examines the evaluation strategies applied to <b>summarising,</b> the issues they raise, and the major programmes. It considers the input, purpose and output factors investigated in recent <b>summarising</b> research, and discusses the classes of strategy, extractive and non-extractive, that have been explored, illustrating the range of systems built. The conclusions drawn are that automatic summarisation has made valuable progress, with useful applications, better evaluation, and more task understanding. But <b>summarising</b> systems are still poorly motivated {{in relation to the}} factors affecting them, and evaluation needs taking much further to engage with the purposes summaries are intended to serve and the contexts in which they are used. 1 Automatic summarising: the state of the art...|$|R

30|$|The key {{inputs and}} {{outcomes}} {{for the analysis}} of the 40 timber investment management regimes and capital budgeting returns in 2011 are <b>summarised</b> in Additional File 2. The trends in LEV and IRR for key countries where we have collected data over time are <b>summarised</b> in Additional File 3. The sensitivity analysis of these returns for the effects of land prices, productivity rates, and environmental regulations for the key countries in the Southern Cone of South America and for the United States are <b>summarised</b> in Additional File 4. Some selected risk estimates as of 2011 for the countries analysed are <b>summarised</b> in Additional File 5.

The analyses of US stock and bond returns since 2000 are <b>summarised</b> in Additional Files 6 and 7 respectively.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the specific amino acid codes, placeholders are used in cases where chemical or crystallographic analysis of a peptide or protein cannot conclusively determine {{the identity of a}} residue. They are also used to <b>summarise</b> conserved protein sequence motifs.

5|$|The work {{consists}} of three sections, an introduction, a central section that details the trial itself, and a conclusion. The introduction and conclusion <b>summarise</b> St-Calais' career {{before and after the}} trial. Although the authenticity of the main account has been challenged in the past, most historians consider it a contemporary record of the trial. Six manuscripts containing the work survive, and it was first printed in 1655, with other editions, including translations, appearing after that.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire body}} {{of the book is}} {{arranged}} as a dictionary from Aberdevine ('Vide Siskin.) on page 58 (the pages are however not numbered in the original) to Yelper ('Vide Avoset.) on page 687. Since the book does not have a continuous narrative to <b>summarise,</b> the account here will use one species as a running example to illustrate the book's approach. The cirl bunting is chosen because it was discovered by Montagu and is associated in Britain with his home town of Kingsbridge, Devon. He also chose the species for the colour frontispiece of the book.|$|E

5|$|The four bulleted lists below <b>summarise</b> {{the known}} {{participants}} to 1725 under each heading. The earliest important match that is designated inter-county was in 1709 {{and the traditional}} county soon became the key unit of organisation. Until 1725, only nine counties (plus London which has on occasion been equated in status with the counties of Middlesex and Surrey for cricketing purposes) had been mentioned in surviving records in connection with cricket and the earliest mention of each is summarised below. Note that all are in the south-eastern quarter of the country. In a similar vein, although not always in association {{with one of the}} above matches, those players, venues, clubs and teams known to have been active or in use by 1725 are also listed.|$|E

40|$|This {{position}} paper suggests that progress with automatic <b>summarising</b> demands a better research methodology and a carefully focussed research strategy. In {{order to develop}} effective procedures {{it is necessary to}} identify and respond to the context factors, i. e. input, purpose, and output factors, that bear on <b>summarising</b> and its evaluation. The paper analyses and illustrates these factors and their implications for evaluation. It then argues that this analysis, together with {{the state of the art}} and the intrinsic difficulty of <b>summarising,</b> imply a nearer-term strategy concentrating on shallow, but not surface, text analysis and on indicative <b>summarising.</b> This is illustrated with current work, from which a potentially productive research programme can be developed...|$|R

25|$|Some astrologers <b>summarise</b> {{the process}} of {{weighting}} by sign through creating {{what is called the}} chart signature. This involves noting which element and quality has the most signs and then combining them into a zodiac sign which is taken to be the signature sign of the chart. So for example, if a person has more fire signs than any other element, and more fixed signs than any other quality, then that person's signature is Leo (the sign which is both fire and fixed).|$|E
