25|$|Since {{its early}} days, Sellafield has {{discharged}} low-level radioactive waste into the sea, using a flocculation process to remove radioactivity from liquid effluent before discharge. Metals dissolved in acidic effluents produced a metal hydroxide flocculant precipitate following {{the addition of}} ammonium hydroxide. The suspension was then transferred to settling tanks where the precipitate would settle out, and the remaining clarified liquid, or <b>supernate,</b> would be discharged to the Irish Sea. In 1994 the Enhanced Actinide Removal Plant (EARP) was opened.

40|$|High level waste at the SRS F- and H-Area Tank Farms {{consists}} of both sludge and <b>supernate</b> fractions. <b>Supernate</b> contains soluble species. Sludge contains both insoluble species and entrained <b>supernate.</b> The {{nature and extent}} of contamination present on waste generated during operation of the F- and H-Area Tank Farms {{is a function of the}} tank, the nature of the job generating the waste, variability in waste handling techniques, and other factors. Historically, supernate-contaminated waste had been segregated and manifested as <b>supernate</b> waste. A single, comprehensive characterization for <b>supernate</b> has been developed previously (Reference 4). Sludge-contaminated waste has been manifested by combining sludge and <b>supernate</b> waste streams to account for entrained <b>supernate</b> present in sludge. Separate sludge waste stream characterizations have been developed for each of the F- and H-Area Tank Farms (Ref. 1 and 2). Low-activity waste (LAW) {{consists of}} both sludge and <b>supernate</b> fractions. Routine LAW is waste that has a maximum dose rate of 50 mrem/hr at 5 cm for Sealands and 35 mrem/hr at 5 cm for Roll-Offs. However, it is intended that routine, low-activity waste not be segregated; therefore, individual low-activity waste cuts may consist of items contaminated with either <b>supernate</b> or sludge in the same container. Historical waste generation rates of the two waste streams will be used to develop a single waste stream distribution representative of low-activity waste. The single distribution is based on the assumption that the actual contamination present on waste in a series of containers from these tanks will be representative of the average supernate/sludge radionuclide distribution. This document develops a characterization for low-activity waste consisting of both radioactive and hazardous constituents. The characterization includes quantification of the average Sealand and Roll-Off containers of routine, low-activity waste. This characterization will apply only to low-level waste that has a whole body (30 cm) dose rate less than or equal to 5 mrem/hr from an individual waste bag or item and has a radionuclide distribution that is represented by the existing high level <b>supernate</b> and sludge waste streams (FHW- 00001 and HTK- 00002). This document specifically refers to the issues of waste management related to the F- and H-Area Tank Farms.

40|$|The {{plan for}} {{stabilizing}} underground storage tanks (USTs) calls for draining the <b>supernate</b> from the tanks; however, {{there is concern}} that draining the <b>supernate</b> from Tank C- 103 will degrade safety in the tank. The sludge in Tank C- 103 contains ranges in depth from 1 to 1. 5 m and is covered by both an aqueous phase and a separate organic layer. The main concern is that draining the <b>supernate</b> will cause the solvent to permeate the sludge solids and provide a source of fuel for a fire {{on the surface of}} the drained sludge. The question of whether the solvent will permeate sludge that is 1 to 1. 5 m deep after the tank is dewatered is the purpose of the tests conducted and described in this report. Evaluation of the solvent permeation mechanism required the preparation of solvent, <b>supernate,</b> and sludge simulants based on the known chemistry of Tank C- 103.

The organic compounds were selected because they are expected to exist in relatively high concentrations in the tanks. Two types of tank <b>supernate</b> simulants were used - a 4.

The solubilities of sodium butyrate and trisodium N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) ethylene- diaminetriacetate in both types of HLW tank <b>supernate</b> solutions were high over the temperature and sodium hydroxide concentration ranges expected in the tanks. The solubilities of these compounds are similar (in terms of total organic carbon) to sodium glycolate, succinate, caproate, dibutylphosphate, citrate, formate, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and nitrilotriacetate which were measured previously. High solubilities will prevent solid sodium salts of these organic acids from precipitating from tank <b>supernate</b> solutions.

40|$|Tank 26 F <b>supernate</b> {{sample was}} sent by Savannah River Remediation to Savannah River National Laboratory for {{evaporation}} test to help understand the underlying cause of the recent gravity drain line (GDL) pluggage during operation of the 2 F Evaporator system. The <b>supernate</b> sample was characterized prior to the evaporation test. The evaporation test involved boiling the <b>supernate</b> in an open beaker until {{the density of the}} concentrate (evaporation product) was between 1. 4 to 1. 5 g/mL. It was followed by filtering and washing of the precipitated solids with deionized water. The concentrate <b>supernate</b> (or concentrate filtrate), the damp unwashed precipitated solids, and the wash filtrates were characterized. All the precipitated solids dissolved during water washing. A semi-quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis on the unwashed precipitated solids revealed their composition. All the compounds with the exception of silica (silicon oxide) are known to be readily soluble in water. Hence, their dissolution during water washing is not unexpected. Even though silica is a sparingly water-soluble compound, its dissolution is also not surprising. This stems from its small fraction in the solids as a whole and also its relative freshness. Assuming similar <b>supernate</b> characteristics, flushing the GDL with water (preferably warm) should facilitate dissolution and removal of future pluggage events as long as build up/aging of the sparingly soluble constituent (silica) is limited. On the other hand, since the amount of silica formed is relatively small, it is quite possible dissolution of the more soluble larger fraction will cause disintegration or fragmentation of the sparingly soluble smaller fraction (that may be embedded in the larger soluble solid mass) and allow its removal via suspension in the flushing water...|$|E
40|$|Lymphokine-rich <b>supernates</b> {{from normal}} human {{peripheral}} blood mononuclear cells, {{stimulated by the}} mitogen phytohemagglutinin, {{have been shown to}} cause enhanced collagen accumulation by human embryonic lung fibroblasts (WI- 38), as measured by hydroxyproline content of fibroblast monolayers, [14 C] proline incorporation into soluble collagen and collagenase release of radioactivity in <b>supernates</b> and monolayers of cultures incubated with [14 C] proline. This fibroblast-stimulating activity, demonstrable by suitable dilutions of the <b>supernates,</b> coexisted with a number of other lymphokine activities such as lymphotoxin, proliferation inhibitory factor, and cloning inhibitory factor, which tend to reduce the numbers of function of fibroblasts. The increased content of collagen appeared to be the product of selected surviving and responding fibroblasts. The factor causing this increased collagen accumulation was nondialyzable and stable at - 70 degrees C. It represents the first described lymphoid cell-derived activity capable of enhancing collagen accumulation. Fibroblast-stimulating activity may be implicated in the abnormal fibrosis seen in association with chronic inflammation in a variety of disease states. It may have special relevance to progressive systemic sclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Two African {{green monkey}} kidney (AGMK) cell lines, 37 RC (interferon-producing) and Vero (non-interferon-producing), were {{infected}} by egg-grown Sendai virus passaged in eggs at {{high or low}} m. o. i. The appearance of haem-adsorption, and cytopathic effect (c. p. e.) {{as well as the}} presence of haemagglutinat-ing virions in the <b>supernates</b> were much more pronounced with a virus seed obtained with Io-a-diluted passages than with a seed obtained with undiluted inoculum. They were also independent of interferon production (data obtained in 37 RC and Vero cells were almost superimposable). In studies carried out with the virus seed prepared at high dilution the establish-ment of infection was maximal when monolayers were infected as soon as 5 h after trypsinization and cell seeding, regardless of cell density. Virus in <b>supernates</b> obtained from cultures infected 5, 2 o or 50 h after seeding exhibited a greatly reduced infectivity for monkey cells, but not apparently for chick embryos. Trypsin treatment of the virus <b>supernates</b> restored their infectivity for AGMK cells more efficiently for virus released from cells infected 5 h after seeding than for viru...|$|R
40|$|Human helper {{factors were}} {{obtained}} from <b>supernates</b> of 48 h unidirectional allogeneic and autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions. These <b>supernates</b> were shown to induce the production of large amounts of immunoglobulin by tonsillar and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Abundant polyclonal activation to antibody production occurred in these cultures {{in the absence of}} antigenic challenge which was similar in degree to that produced by pokeweed mitogen. This was documented by quantitating plasma cells, specific plaque-forming cells, and secreted immunoglobulin. In addition, the supplementation of companion cultures with sheep erythrocytes resulted in a significant enhancement of the specific plaque-forming cell response without an appreciable change in plasma cell number of secreted Ig...|$|R
