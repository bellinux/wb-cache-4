5|$|Although a {{judicial}} system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He {{would sit in}} judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of <b>state</b> <b>terror</b> {{as a tool of}} intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were antithetical to a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness as tools of intimidation.|$|E

Justification focuses on authorisation and rationalisation strategies <b>stating</b> <b>terror</b> threats explicitly, which are often expressed by governmental actors. Delegitimation strategies predominantly use moralising and mythopoetic arguments of civil liberties and are expressed by Snowden himself, politicians, rarely by journalists, non-governmental organisations, and very rarely by citizens. However, what exactly is at stake when mass surveillance increases remains obscure in the broadcast discourse. The surveillance discourse should be richer especially {{in order to give}} the audience a chance to understand the less concrete contra-surveillance arguments better...|$|R

According to Memorial, the purpose of the [...] "filtration" [...] system in Chechnya, besides being part of the general <b>state</b> <b>terror</b> system for suppression and intimidation of the population, was to create a network of informers through the enforced recruitation, and was characterised by its non-selectivity, that is by arbitrary arrests and mass detentions of innocent people.|$|E

The report received extensive national and international news coverage. On 6 June 2010, the Tribunal {{released a}} brief on the alleged fake-encounter killings of Shahzad Ahmad, Riyaz Ahmad, and Mohammad Shafi in Kupwara district, titled [...] "Fake Encounters and <b>State</b> <b>Terror</b> in Kashmir". Chatterji presented {{the findings of the}} [...] "Buried Evidence" [...] report before the All Party Parliamentary Group on Kashmir (APPG-K) of the U.K. Parliament on 16 June 2010, urging [...] "international and independent investigations into the issue of fake encounters, disappearances, and unknown and mass graves" [...] and asked the UK Parliament to [...] "reintroduce and pass the Early Day Motion #433, introduced in the House of Commons... on December 10, 2009, based on IPTK’s report". In 2011, the State Human Rights Commission of Jammu and Kashmir corroborated the IPTK's report.|$|E
2500|$|This {{generalization}} of <b>state</b> <b>terror</b> tactics has been explained {{in part by}} the information received by the Argentine militaries in the infamous School of Americas and also by French instructors from the secret services, who taught them [...] "counter-insurgency" [...] tactics first experimented during the Algerian War (1954–62). In 1976 there was a successful series of Montoneros bomb attacks in which the general commanding the Federal Police, Cesáreo Cardozo was killed. Lieutenant-General Jorge Videla narrowly escaped three Montoneros assassination attempts between February 1976 and April 1977. On 14 December 1975, the Montoneros conducted an assassination attempt against Navy Commandant Admiral Emilio Massera. In an underwater mining attack on the Itati yacht of the Argentine Navy, the luxury craft was badly damaged by the explosives but Massera escaped unscathed. As pressure mounted on the Montoneros, the urban guerrillas struck back. On 29 April 1976, the guerrillas planted explosives on six Mirage IIIEA interceptors from Grupo 8 but this attack was foiled by alert sentries. On 2 July 1976 a Claymore shrapnel mine exploded at the headquarters of the Federal Police in west Buenos Aires during a secret meeting of the police leadership, killing 21, and injuring 60 others. On 12 September 1976, a car bomb destroyed a bus filled with police officers in Rosario, killing 9 policemen and 2 civilians and injuring at least 50.|$|E

2500|$|On 9 April 2015, the Ukrainian {{parliament}} {{passed legislation}} on decommunization. It was {{submitted by the}} Second Yatsenyuk Government, banning the promotion of symbols of “Communist and National Socialist totalitarian regimes”. One of the main provisions of the bill was {{the recognition of the}} Soviet Union was [...] "criminal" [...] and one that it [...] "pursued a <b>state</b> <b>terror</b> policy". The legislation prohibits the use of Communist symbols and propaganda and also bans all symbols and propaganda of national-socialism and its values and any activities of Nazi or fascist groups in Ukraine. The ban applies to monuments, place and street names. The ban does not apply to World War II monuments and when symbols are located in a cemetery. Expressing pro-communist views was not made illegal. The ban on communist symbols did result in the removement of hundreds of statues, the replacement of millions of street signs and the renaming of populated places including some of Ukraine's biggest cities like Dnipropetrovsk, and the oblasts of Dnipropetrovsk and Kirovohrad. The city administration of Dnipropetrovsk estimated in June 2015 that 80 streets, embankments, squares, and boulevards would have to be renamed. Maxim Eristavi of Hromadske.TV estimated late April 2015 that the nationwide renaming would cost around $1.5billion (€1.38billion). The legislation also granted special legal status to veterans of the “struggle for Ukrainian independence” from 1917 to 1991 (the lifespan of the Soviet Union). The same day, the parliament also passed a law that replaced the term [...] "Great Patriotic War" [...] in the national lexicon with [...] "World War II" [...] from 1939 to 1945, a change of great significance since during the initial part of World War II the USSR was in a pact with Germany and invaded six countries in coordination with its Nazi co-aggressor.|$|E
