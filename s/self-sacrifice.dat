5|$|The Mahabharata portrays Iravan as dying {{a heroic}} {{death in the}} 18-day Kurukshetra War (Mahabharata war), the epic's main subject. However, the South Indian cults have a {{supplementary}} tradition of honouring Aravan's <b>self-sacrifice</b> to the goddess Kali to ensure her favour and {{the victory of the}} Pandavas in the war. The Kuttantavar cult focuses on one of the three boons granted to Aravan by the god Krishna in honour of this <b>self-sacrifice.</b> Aravan requested that he be married before his death. Krishna satisfied this boon in his female form, Mohini. In Koovagam (கூவாகம்), Tamil Nadu, this incident is re-enacted in an 18-day festival, first by a ceremonial marriage of Aravan to ThiruNangais and male villagers (who have taken vows to Aravan) and then by their widowhood after ritual re-enactment of Aravan's sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of <b>self-sacrifice,</b> all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This {{seems to have been a}} particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Using Zn {{nanowires}} as a <b>self-sacrificed</b> template, hierarchical tubes {{constructed by}} zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoflakes and ZnO nanotubes {{have been successfully}} fabricated by two different thermal-oxidation modes. The products were characterized by the X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The experimental {{results show that the}} formation processes of ZnO nanostructures are sensitive to the growth temperature, which is lower or higher the melting point of Zn (419 ℃). Our method provides an easy and convenient way to prepare metal oxides tubular nanostructures with different morphologies through <b>self-sacrificed</b> template method via adjusting the heat-treatment process...|$|R

5|$|Sonya gives Rodya a cross {{when he goes}} to turn {{himself in}} and symbolizes the burden Raskolnikov must bear. Sonya tells him they will bear the cross {{together}} and is taking part of his burden onto herself, encouraging him to confess. Sonya and Lizaveta had exchanged crosses, so originally the cross was Lizaveta's—whom Rodya didn't intend to kill, making it an important symbol of redemption. Sonya's face reminds him of Lizaveta's face, another example of his guilty conscience and symbolizes a shared grief. <b>Self-sacrifice,</b> along with poverty, is a larger theme of the novel. The desperation of poverty creates a situation where the only way to survive is through <b>self-sacrifice,</b> which Raskolnikov consistently rejects, as part of his philosophical reasoning. For example, he rejects Razumikhin's offer of employment and the idea of his sister's arranged marriage. Raskolnikov originally rejects Sonya's offer to accompany him to the confession but, in a feverish state of mind, sees her following him through the market, and finds power in that idealism.|$|E
5|$|Acarya Ananda Jha, {{the author}} of the Chinnamasta Tattva, prescribes her worship by {{soldiers}} as she embodies self-control of lust, heroic <b>self-sacrifice</b> for the benefit of others, and fearlessness in the face of death. In a collective prayer to the Mahavidyas in the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, the devotee prays to emulate Chhinnamasta in her generosity to others. Other goals common to worship of all Mahavidyas are: poetic speech, well-being, control of one's foes, removal of obstacles, ability to sway kings, ability to attract others, conquest over other kings, and, finally, moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|According to {{professor}} Nalini Natarajan of the University of Puerto Rico, Nargis's Mother India is a metonymic {{representation of a}} Hindu woman, reflecting high Hindu values, with virtuous morality and motherly <b>self-sacrifice.</b> Film scholar Jyotika Virdi wrote that Mother India could {{also be seen as}} a metaphor of the trinity of mother, God, and a dynamic nation. Vijay Mishra, in his 2002 book Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire, opined that the Mother India figure is an icon in several respects—being associated with a goddess, her function as a wife, as a lover, and even compromising her femininity {{at the end of the}} film by playing the role of Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer, masculine gods.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigated whether groups use reputational {{information to}} recruit new members. The authors manipulated the candidate’s reported <b>self-sacrifices</b> {{to enter the}} group {{and the source of}} this information. The authors found that third party information was more influential in group admission decisions than information from the candidates themselves, suggesting the power of reputations. Furthermore, group admission rates were also influenced by opportunities to socialize new group members. These results are discussed in light of their contribution to research on reputations and group dynamics...|$|R
50|$|S.saevissima, {{similar to}} the other social insects in the order Hymenoptera, is eusocial: an extreme form of kin {{selection}} in which {{members of a group}} willingly give up their reproductive abilities in favor of the reproductive success of their close relatives. For S. saevissima, the workers are all sterile female daughters who dedicate their lives to the caring and protection of their future sisters: the broods of the fertile queen (their mother). In eusociality, the sterile ants often perform specialized tasks to effectively care for the reproductive queen, including group defense and <b>self-sacrifices.</b>|$|R
5|$|Architecturally, most war {{memorials}} {{were relatively}} conservative in design, aiming to use established styles {{to produce a}} tragic but comforting, noble and enduring commemoration of the war dead. Classical themes were particularly common, taking the prevailing styles of the late 19th century and typically simplifying them to produce cleaner, more abstract memorials. Allegorical and symbolic features, frequently drawing on Christian imagery, were used to communicate themes of <b>self-sacrifice,</b> victory and death. Some memorials adopted a medievalist theme instead, looking backwards to a more secure past, while others used emerging realist and Art Deco architectural styles to communicate the themes of the war.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{became friends}} with C. W. Post, who was a patient at the sanitarium, but Post was healed by a Christian Science faith healer, Mrs Elizabeth K. Gregory. In 1892, Post started La Vita Inn, a sanitarium {{of his own and}} brought Beilhart on as an associate. The two men took {{instruction}} in Christian Science. Both Post and Beilhart rejected the doctrine of the religion but they embraced the view that illness was an illusion and could be overcome by mental suggestion, prayer, and <b>self-sacrifice.</b>|$|E
5|$|Harith {{was from}} the Tamim tribe {{belonging}} to the north Arab (Mudari) tribal supergroup, and hailed from Basra, where his father, Surayj, lived. He is first mentioned in 729, when he distinguished himself for his bravery and <b>self-sacrifice</b> against the Turgesh, saving the Arab army from annihilation at Baykand near Bukhara. Harith is next mentioned in 733, when he led a protest in Lower Tokharistan against the commandeering of supplies from the province, already plagued by drought and famine, to feed the capital of Khurasan at Marw, by the governor Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Murri. Junayd had Harith flogged, but after Junayd died in early 734, the discontent erupted into an open rebellion, with Harith at its head.|$|E
60|$|Such men {{and women}} of rank brought into the convent, meanwhile, all the {{prestige}} of their rank, all their superior knowledge of the world; and became the patrons and protectors of the society; while they submitted, generally with peculiar humility and devotion, to its most severe and degrading rules. Their higher sensibilities, instead of making them shrink from hardship, made them strong to endure <b>self-sacrifices,</b> and often self-tortures, which seem to us all but incredible; and the lives, or rather living deaths, of the noble and princely penitents of the early middle age, are among the most beautiful tragedies of humanity.|$|R
40|$|Interfacial nanodroplets were grafted to the {{surfaces}} of <b>self-sacrificed</b> template particles in a galvanic reaction system to assist the construction of 3 D Au porous structures. The interfacial nanodroplets were formed via direct adsorption of surfactant-free emulsions onto the particle surfaces. The interfacial nanodroplets discretely distributed at the template particle surfaces and served as soft templates to guide the formation of porous Au structures. The self-variation of footprint sizes of interfacial nanodroplets during Au growth {{gave rise to a}} hierarchical pore size distribution of the obtained Au porous particles. This strategy could be easily extended to synthesize bimetal porous particles such as Au-Pt and Au-Pd. The obtained porous Au, Au-Pt, and Au-Pd particles showed excellent catalytic activity in catalytic reduction of 4 -nitrophenol...|$|R
40|$|We {{argued in}} Unfit for the Future that moral {{enhancement}} – which might include biomedical moral enhancement – {{is necessary to}} solve the coordination problem presented by the amelioration of anthropogenic climate change. Stefan Schlag contends that this proposal is self-defeating because the implementation of biomedical moral enhancement poses the same problems as combatting climate change. We reply {{that it can be}} seen that this is not so when it is realized that we can be sufficiently morally motivated to form an intention in advance to act in a certain (moral) way when a situation arises without being sufficiently motivated to follow through this intention when we are in the midst of the situation and actually experience the <b>self-sacrifices</b> this way of acting imposes on us...|$|R
5|$|The Annamalaiyar temple {{is one of}} the Pancha Bhoota Stalams, or five Shiva temples, {{with each}} a manifestation of a natural element: land, water, air, sky and fire. In Annamalaiyar temple, Shiva is said to have {{manifested}} himself as a massive column of fire, whose crown and feet could not be found by the Hindu gods, Brahma and Vishnu. The main lingam in the shrine is referred as Agni Lingam, and represents duty, virtue, <b>self-sacrifice</b> and liberation through ascetic life {{at the end of the}} Agni kalpa.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, while others have praised its emphasis on <b>self-sacrifice</b> and on the way in which a person's character {{is the result of the}} person's choices.|$|E
5|$|Typically, cemeteries of {{more than}} 40 graves contain a Cross of Sacrifice {{designed}} by architect Reginald Blomfield. This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in churchyards in England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic cross. The cross is normally a freestanding four-point limestone Latin cross, mounted on an octagonal base, and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet. A bronze longsword, blade down, is embedded {{on the face of}} the cross. This cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery, intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of <b>self-sacrifice.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The MRS, {{which was}} founded in Chittagong, Bengal Presidency, saw their aim of {{improvements}} in the status of women and the achievement of swaraj (self-governance) as being mutually dependent. Education of women was a key to this and the MRS involved ten existing local educational groups from the outset. According to historian Geraldine Forbes, MRS leaders [...] "argued the nation could never be free unless women's lives improved and improving women's lives depended on freedom from foreign domination". Latika Bose appealed for women to see the similarities of the women's struggle in the battles waged between the devas and asuras of Hindu mythology, and in the <b>self-sacrifices</b> of Rajput queens who had surrendered their male relatives to battle before preparing to die themselves in acts of jauhar (self-immolation).|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} reports {{the development and}} validation of the Self-Defeating Interpersonal Style Scale (SELF-DISS), a measure {{for the assessment of}} the propensity to engage in the chronic tolerance of mistreatment in relationships. Studies 1 and 2 followed a strategical 7 -step process for developing valid and reliable measures. Study 1 proposed a theoretical model and developed a reliable measure to tap the three proposed factors on three scales: Insecure Attachment, Undeserving Self-Image, and <b>Self-Sacrificing</b> Nature. Study 2 replicated Study 1 as well as refined the SELF-DISS model to 35 items that indicated an excellent fit. Study 2 tested construct validity via correlational and modelling analyses using the Hogan Personality Inventory (HPI), the Hogan Development Survey (HDS), and the Motives, Values, and Preferences Inventory (MVPI). Results showed strong support for {{the reliability and validity of}} the SELF-DISS as a second-order construct with three distinct factors...|$|R

5|$|Around 17 hours later, {{the plane}} loses {{auxiliary}} power, {{and the lights}} go out inside. Despite Neerja and the other attendants' attempts to explain, the terrorists assume the Pakistanis cut the power deliberately, and anticipate an imminent Pakistani raid on the plane. The panicking hijackers begin shooting down passengers indiscriminately; at great peril to her own life, Neerja opens the rear door and deploys the chute, directing passengers out of the plane. Choosing to let the passengers escape first, Neerja is fatally shot by the terrorists when she tries to shield young children from the gunfire. The film ends with a tribute to Neerja, who was eventually honoured posthumously with the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest military decoration awarded for peacetime valor, courageous action or <b>self-sacrifice.</b>|$|E
5|$|Critics commented {{upon the}} character's {{resemblance}} both to horror film killers such as Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter, {{as well as}} to American Evangelists and to the biblical Jesus Christ. The series also follows Danes' rise and fall in the public eye and the precariousness of fame. Though critics questioned the wisdom of having a pedophile as a character, the show's creative team was adamant that they had deliberately made him unlikable. In killing the character off, the creative team did not wish to suggest that the character had been redeemed for his earlier crimes, and made sure that this was emphasised even in his final act of <b>self-sacrifice.</b> Pullman has expressed interest in reprising the role in a future Torchwood series.|$|E

50|$|The {{practice}} of qurbani {{can be traced}} back to Abraham (Ibrahim), who dreamt that God ordered him to sacrifice his son. Abraham agreed to follow God's command and perform the sacrifice, however, God intervened and informed him that his sacrifice had been accepted. Unlike the Bible, there is no mention in the Qur'an of an animal (ram) replacing the boy, rather he is replaced with a 'great sacrifice'. Since the sacrifice of a ram cannot be greater than that of Abraham's son (and a prophet in Islam at that), this replacement seems to point to either the religious institutionalisation of sacrifice itself, or to the future <b>self-sacrifices</b> of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions (who were destined to emerge from the progeny of Ishmael) in the cause of their faith. From that day onward, every Eid al-Adha once a year, Muslims around the world slaughter an animal to commemorate Abraham's sacrifice and to remind themselves of abnegation.|$|R

50|$|As Abraham {{attempts}} to kill Ishmael, either the knife is turned {{over in his}} hand or copper appears on Ishmael to prevent the death and God tells Abraham that he has fulfilled the command.

5|$|Major {{memorial}} themes, such as {{victory and}} death all had their symbols. Many Canadian and British soldiers are shown raising a hat or a rifle, {{a sign of}} victory first introduced into Boer War memorials. The Greek goddess Nike herself frequently appears on civic memorials, particularly in Britain and Canada, personifying victory, often pointing the way to soldiers: the image is far less, common, however, on more sombre memorials in battlefields and graveyards. Personifications of Death rarely feature on these memorials, however, probably because the emphasis is typically on the <b>self-sacrifice</b> of the soldiers involved, rather than their being taken or claimed by Death. Death is more typically presented through images of widows, orphans and elderly parents on memorials, all popular inter-war allegorical forms for death and grieving. Figures of women often represented peace, civilisation or wider humanity.|$|E
5|$|Merit can {{be gained}} {{in a number}} of ways, such as giving, virtue and mental development. In addition, there are many forms of merit-making {{described}} in ancient Buddhist texts. A similar concept of kusala (Sanskrit: kusala) is also known, which is different from merit in some details. The most fruitful form of merit-making is those good deeds done with regard to the Triple Gem, that is, the Buddha, his teachings, the Dhamma (Sanskrit: Dharma), and the Sangha. In Buddhist societies, a great variety of practices involving merit-making has grown throughout the centuries, sometimes involving great <b>self-sacrifice.</b> Merit has become part of rituals, daily and weekly practice, and festivals. In addition, there is a widespread custom of transferring merit to one's deceased relatives, of which the origin is still a matter of scholarly debate. Merit has been that important in Buddhist societies, that kingship was often legitimated through it, and still is.|$|E
5|$|Stories in {{the series}} {{frequently}} emphasize the internal struggles, passions, and tragedies of the characters, and the main plot often recedes into the background as the focus shifts to their personal lives. Games also explore relationships between characters, ranging from love to rivalry. Other recurring situations that drive the plot include amnesia, a hero corrupted by an evil force, mistaken identity, and <b>self-sacrifice.</b> Magical orbs and crystals are recurring in-game items that are frequently connected to the themes of the games' plots. Crystals often {{play a central role}} in the creation of the world, and a majority of the Final Fantasy games link crystals and orbs to the planet's life force. As such, control over these crystals drives the main conflict. The classical elements are also a recurring theme {{in the series}} related to the heroes, villains, and items. Other common plot and setting themes include the Gaia hypothesis, an apocalypse, and conflicts between advanced technology and nature.|$|E
50|$|In its {{exploration}} {{of how to}} bond with nature, ecopsychology {{is interested in the}} examples provided by a wide variety of ancient and modern cultures that have histories of embracing nature. Examples include aboriginal, pagan, Jain, Buddhist, and Hindu cultures, as well as shamanism and the more recent hesychast tradition. Of interest is how identity becomes entwined with nature, so that loss of those sacred places is far more devastating to indigenous people than often understood. Native American stories, in particular, illustrate a socially recognized sense of community between humans and the natural landscape. The Māori philosophy, and practice of kaitiakitanga, or eco-guardianship, and preservation emphasizes a deep connect between humans, and their environment. Eastern Orthodox monks led a contemplative life deeply intertwined with nature. Other lessons include how to live sustainably within an environment and the <b>self-sacrifices</b> made to tolerate natural limits, such as population control or a nomadic existence that allows the environment to regenerate. Moreover, certain indigenous cultures have developed methods of psychotherapy involving the presence of trees, rivers, and astronomical bodies.|$|R
