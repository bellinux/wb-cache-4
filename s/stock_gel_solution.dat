This technology was quickly dropped due to its inherent disadvantages such as selective injectivity, possible damage to low permeability zones, dispersion and dilution of gelant, syneresis, dehydration, and inadequate control of gelation time (Seright 1990; Young et al. 1988; Asghari 1999; Bryant et al. 1996; Willhite et al. 1986).|$|R

30|$|In situ {{cross-linking}} {{polymer gel}} was widely used for water plugging in oilfield production, {{and a good}} result was achieved (Tang et al. 1996). This technology is that acrylamide, methylene diacrylamide and initiator were injected into the formation to form a high strength gel by in situ polymerization. The two most typical were “K-trol” and “TP system”, which were developed by Halliburton company in USA and PetroChina Exploration and Development Research Institute, respectively (Vossoughi 2000; Li 1988). The initial viscosity of the <b>gelling</b> <b>solution</b> was approximate 2  mPa s, which was almost equal to the viscosity of water, so that it had good pumping capability. A successful application of the technology was in Lick Creek oilfield (Woods et al. 1986). However, the technology had obvious flaw (Jia and Pu 2013): (1) The <b>gelling</b> <b>solution</b> was easy to be diluted by formation water and the reducing agents in the formation water could make the initiator lose efficacy; (2) The <b>gelling</b> <b>solutions</b> with low viscosity were easy to enter into low permeability layer to greatly lead to wrong plugging; (3) The gelation time was short so that the technology only plugged the near-wellbore area. So the application of this technology was limited due to these unfavorable factors.|$|R

30|$|The {{change in}} shear stress with shear rate at {{different}} reaction time intervals and pH was studied using Physica Rheolab MC 1. It was {{observed that the}} polymer <b>gel</b> <b>solution</b> is non-Newtonian, and the values of shear stress increase with increasing shear rate which indicates that the viscosity of solution is shear rate-dependent.

This increased viscosity leads to gel formation which in turn behaves as flow-diverting agent or blocking agent for controlling excessive water production in the oil fields. There is no strong effect of pH on the rheological behavior of HMTA and pyrocatechol cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide gel system. Different polymer gel systems have different ranges of pH over which they can maintain their stability. All the experiments were carried out at pH 7.5.|$|R

40|$|Background: On {{account of}} the lower {{electron}} density in the lung tissue, the dose distribution in the lung cannot be verified with the existing polymer gel dosimeters. Thus, the aims {{of this study are}} to make a low density polymer gel dosimeter and investigate the effect of nitrogen gas bubbles on the R 2 responses and its homogeneity. Materials and Methods: Two different types of low density polymer gel dosimeters were prepared according to a composition proposed by De Deene, with some modifications. In the first type, no nitrogen gas was perfused through the <b>gel</b> <b>solution</b> and water. In the second type, to expel the dissolved oxygen, nitrogen gas was perfused through the water and <b>gel</b> <b>solution.</b> The post-irradiation times in the gels were 24 and 5 hours, respectively, with and without perfusion of nitrogen gas through the water and <b>gel</b> <b>solution.</b> Results: In the first type of gel, there was a linear correlation between the doses and R 2 responses from 0 to 12 Gy. The fabricated gel had a higher dynamic range than the other low density polymer gel dosimeter; but its background R 2 response was higher. In the second type, no difference in R 2 response was seen in the dose ranges from 0 to 18 Gy. Both gels had a mass density between 0. 35 and 0. 45 g. cm - 3 and CT values of about - 650 to - 750 Hounsfield units. Conclusion: It appeared that reactions between gelatin-free radicals and monomers, due to an increase in the gel temperature during rotation in the household mixer, led to a higher R 2 -background response. In the second type of gel, it seemed that the collapse of the nitrogen bubbles was the main factor that affected the R 2 -responses...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} dip-coatable, high-capacitance ion gel {{dielectric}} for scalable fabrication of three-dimensional (3 D) electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) {{devices such as}} an n × n liquid prism array. Due {{to the formation of}} a nanometer-thick electric double layer (EDL) capacitor, an ion gel dielectric offers two to three orders higher specific capacitance (c ≈ 10 μF/cm 2) than that of conventional dielectrics such as SiO 2. However, the previous spin-coating method used for gel layer deposition poses several issues for 3 D EWOD device fabrication, particularly when assembling multiple modules. Not only does the spin-coating process require multiple repetitions per module, but the ion gel layer also comes in risks of damage or contamination due to handling errors caused during assembly. In addition, it was observed that the chemical formulation previously used for the spin-coating method causes the surface defects on the dip-coated gel layers and thus leads to poor EWOD performance. In this paper, we alternatively propose a dip-coating method with modified <b>gel</b> <b>solutions</b> to obtain defect-free, functional ion gel layers without the issues arising from the spin-coating method for 3 D device fabrication. A dip-coating approach offers a single-step coating solution with the benefits of simplicity, scalability, and high throughput for deposition of high-capacitance gel layers on non-planar EWOD devices. An ion <b>gel</b> <b>solution</b> was prepared by combining the [EMIM][TFSI] ionic liquid and the [P(VDF-HFP) ] copolymer at various wt % ratios in acetone solvent.

The effectiveness and potentiality of dip-coatable gel layers for 3 D EWOD devices have been demonstrated through fabricating 5 × 1 arrayed liquid prisms using a single-step dip-coating method.
