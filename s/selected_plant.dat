The Kew botanists treat the monocots as falling into three major groupings: alismatid monocots (Acorales, Alismatales), lilioid monocots (the five other non-commelinid monocots) and commelinid monocots. They also organize their monocot research into two teams I: Alismatids and Lilioids and II: Commelinids. A similar approach is taken by Judd in his Plant systematics.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Plant based natural {{antioxidant}} phyto-chemicals {{are capable}} of exerting antioxidant effect by quenching various free radical species. Routinely used synthetic antioxidants in many products, medicines and as food pre-servative agent, impose long term harmful effects. Hence in the present investigation, considering the bio-safe and highly significant therapeutic role of antioxidant phyto-chemicals, an {{effort was made to}} test the antioxidant capacity from certain commonly found and naturally growing plants of Gujarat and to assess their natural defense system. A comparative evaluation of different solvent extracts was made to find the effective FICA fraction from <b>selected</b> <b>plants.</b> Plant extracts were prepared using polar to non-polar solvents like water, methanol, chloroform and petroleum ether.

2500|$|Philodendron {{is a large}} genus of {{flowering}} plants in the Araceae family. , the World Checklist of <b>Selected</b> <b>Plant</b> Families accepted 489 species; other sources accept different numbers. Regardless of number of species, the genus is the second-largest member of the Araceae family. Taxonomically, the genus Philodendron is still poorly known, with many undescribed species. Many are grown as ornamental and indoor plants. The name derives from the Greek words philo- or [...] "love, affection" [...] and dendron or [...] "tree". [...] They are commonly called by their generic name.|$|E

The Level 2 codes 77 and 78 are South-Central U.S.A. and Southeastern U.S.A respectively; the absence of parentheses shows that the species is native to these regions. Parentheses around codes {{are used in the}} WCSP to show that the species is naturalized rather than native.

40|$|Aims: In {{this study}} the aqueous extract of Olea europeae, Myrtus communis and Monotheca buxifolia were {{screened}} for antibacterial activity, total phenolic content, polyphenol, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, β-carotene and lycopene. Design of the Study: The study {{is composed of}} identification and quantification of bioactive compounds in <b>selected</b> <b>plants</b> through HPLC. Place and Duration of the Study: Biochemistry Lab, Department of Chemistry University of Malakand Pakistan. The study duration was from September 2015 to August 2016. Methodology: The antibacterial activities of the <b>selected</b> <b>plants</b> extracts were determined using agar well diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration methods. The total polyphenol contents were determined by Follin Ciocalteu reagent method. The extract was subjected to HPLC analysis for antioxidants concentration. Results: The zone of inhibition against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus were 1. 82, 1. 52, 1. 72 and 2. 46 cm for Olea europeae extract, 1. 51, 2. 06, 1. 98, 1. 79 cm for Myrtus communis extract, 1. 98, 2. 28, 2. 36, 1. 62 cm for stem extract and 1. 78, 2. 05, 1. 80, 1. 77 cm for root extract of Monotheca buxifolia respectively. Morin, Quercetin and Chlorogenic acid were detected at retention times; 12. 518, 10. 022 and 6. 305 minutes respectively in Olea europeae extract.
