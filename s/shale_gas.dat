5|$|Because the hot recycle solids are heated in a {{separate}} furnace, the oil <b>shale</b> <b>gas</b> from these technologies is not diluted with combustion exhaust gas. Another advantage {{is that there is}} no limit on the smallest particles that the retort can process, thus allowing all the crushed feed to be used. One disadvantge is that more water is used to handle the resulting finer shale ash.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{polygeneration}} {{process is}} {{presented in this paper}} that co-produces olefins, methanol, dimethyl ether, and electricity from conventional pipeline natural gas and different kinds of <b>shale</b> <b>gases.</b> Technical analyses of many variants of the process are performed, considering differences in power generation strategy and gas type. The technical analysis results show that the efficiency of the plant varies between 22 %– 57 % (HHV) depending on the product portfolio. The efficiency is higher than a traditional methanol-to-olefin process, which enables it to be competitive with traditional naphtha cracking plants...|$|R
5|$|Wales {{has some}} {{potential}} for the onshore production of oil and gas. <b>Shale</b> <b>gas</b> may be obtained by fracking and there is methane in unmined coal seams that may be extractable. Another potential source of gas is the underground controlled combustion of coal seams to produce syngas, a mixture of hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide.|$|E
5|$|Heating {{oil shale}} to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature causes the chemical process of pyrolysis {{to yield a}} vapor. Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid shale oil—an unconventional oil—is separated from combustible oil-shale gas (the term <b>shale</b> <b>gas</b> can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales). Oil shale can also be burned directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for power generation and district heating or used as a raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing.|$|E
5|$|Offshore oil and {{gas from}} North Sea and Irish Sea, and more {{recently}} offshore wind, are significant components in Northern England's energy mix. Although deep-pit coal mining in the UK ended in 2015 with the closure of Kellingley Colliery, North Yorkshire, there are also several open-pit mines in the area. <b>Shale</b> <b>gas</b> is especially prevalent across Northern England, although plans to extract it through hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") {{have proven to be}} controversial.|$|E
40|$|With {{the recent}} {{growth of the}} natural gas {{industry}} coupled with technological advancements, <b>gas</b> <b>shale</b> fracturing has become an effective and highly profitable method for natural gas production. Unlike conventional natural gas extraction which may require vertical fracturing, <b>gas</b> <b>shale</b> fracturing relies on a method known as horizontal fracturing to remove gas trapped within the impermeable facies. Compared to vertical fracturing, horizontal fracturing requires larger amounts of fluids to be injected downhole under high pressure. These fracturing fluids can contain high concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons with known adverse health effects. Due to the large volumes used, the potential for groundwater contamination has caused concern in the public. In this study, groundwater quality was evaluated in regions associated with <b>gas</b> <b>shale</b> fracturing. Groundwater samples were collected from 15 shallow aquifer wells at varying depths in areas near <b>gas</b> <b>shale</b> fracturing sites in north-central Arkansas. Samples were also collected from 7 groundwater monitoring wells in proposed <b>gas</b> <b>shale</b> production areas in New York State.

5|$|The Marcellus {{natural gas}} trend, which {{encompasses}} 104,000 square miles and stretches across Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and into southeast Ohio and upstate New York, {{is the largest}} source of natural gas in the United States, and production was still growing rapidly in 2013. The Marcellus {{is an example of}} <b>shale</b> <b>gas,</b> natural gas trapped in low-permeability shale, and requires the well completion method of hydraulic fracturing to allow the gas to flow to the well bore. The surge in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale since 2008 has generated both economic benefits and environmental concerns—and thus, considerable controversy.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, Estonian {{oil shale}} was {{described}} by several scientists and used as a low-grade fuel. Its use in industry commenced in 1916. Production of shale oil began in 1921 and oil shale was first used to generate electrical power in 1924. Shortly thereafter, systematic research into oil shale and its products began, and in 1938 a department of mining was established at Tallinn Technical University. After World War II, Estonian oil <b>shale</b> <b>gas</b> was used in Saint Petersburg (then called Leningrad) and in northern cities in Estonia {{as a substitute for}} natural gas. Increased need for electricity in the north-west of the Soviet Union led to the construction of large oil shale-fired power stations. Oil shale extraction peaked in 1980. Subsequently, the launch of nuclear reactors in Russia, particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station, reduced demand for electricity produced from oil shale, and, along with a post-Soviet restructuring of the industry in the 1990s, led to a decrease in oil shale mining. After decreasing for two decades, oil shale mining started to increase again {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century.|$|E
5|$|In June 1916, the Russian {{geologist}} Nikolay Pogrebov oversaw mining of {{the first}} tonnes of oil shale at Pavandu and delivered it to Saint Petersburg (then Petrograd) Polytechnic Institute for large-scale experiments. These events marking {{the beginning of the}} Estonian oil shale industry took place {{more than half a century}} after an oil shale industry had emerged in Scotland, the leading oil shale industry in 1916, and a decade before the industry emerged in China, which, besides Estonia, is today the other leading oil shale-exploiting country. In 1916 a total of 640–690tonnes of oil shale were sent to Saint Petersburg for testing. The tests proved that the oil shale was suitable for combustion as a solid fuel and for extraction of oil <b>shale</b> <b>gas</b> and shale oil. Based on these promising results, a plan for oil shale mining in Estonia was presented to the Emperor Nicholas II on 3 January 1917. On 13 February 1917, the Council of Ministers of Russia allocated 1.2million rubles to purchase land and start mining activities. After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government appointed a special commissioner for oil shale purchasing and stockpiling who began preliminary work for the digging of an oil shale mine at Pavandu, with full-scale construction carried out by about 500workers, including war prisoners, in the summer of 1917. After the October Revolution, financing ceased and construction stopped. Two private Saint Petersburg firms, established specially for oil shale mining, Böckel& Co. and Mutschnik& Co., which in the fall of 1916 had begun surface mining at Kukruse and Järve, respectively, also terminated their mining activities in 1917.|$|E

40|$|The mature, organic-rich shales {{sourcing}} {{much of the}} hydrocar-bons {{that have}} been produced from conventional reservoirs in the United States now represent both developed reserves and potential resources. Gas shales have become an attractive target because they represent a huge resource (500 to 780 TCF 1), and {{as the price of}} gas rises, the economic challenge of their devel-opment is reduced. Multiple operators are currently leasing and evaluating <b>gas</b> <b>shale</b> properties throughout the United States. If the prospective <b>gas</b> <b>shales</b> can be economically developed, many thousands of wells will be drilled in this region during the next decade. Key reservoir parameters for <b>gas</b> <b>shale</b> deposits include: 1) thermal maturity, 2) reservoir thickness, 3) total organic carbon (TOC) content, 4) adsorbed gas fraction, 5) free gas fraction within the pores and fractures, and 6) permeability. The first two parameters are routinely measured. Thermal maturity is com-monly measured in core analysis and reservoir thickness is routinely measured with logs. The calculation of the final four parameters requires a novel approach. A robust <b>gas</b> <b>shale</b> interpretation package has been developed utilizing the Platform Express * and Elemental Capture Spectros-copy * (ECS) logging tools. The ECS is key to this package as it provides gamma-ray-independent clay content plus a matrix density that compensates for the variable lithology typical of <b>gas</b> <b>shale.</b> ELAN * Elemental Log Analysis is used to quantify kerogen and calculate porosity and gas saturations. A complete <b>gas</b> <b>shale</b> log evaluation requires calibration to core for thermal maturity and a metric to equate TOC to adsorbed gas.
