50|$|The <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle</b> (or pubic angle) is {{the angle}} {{in the human}} body as the apex of the pubic arch, formed by the {{convergence}} of the inferior rami of the ischium and pubis on either side. The <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle</b> is important in forensic anthropology, in determining the sex of someone from skeletal remains. A <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle</b> of 50-82 degrees indicates a male; an angle of 90 degrees indicates a female. Women have wider hips - a greater <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle</b> - in order to allow for child birth. Other sources operates with 50-60 degrees for males and 70-90 degrees in females.|$|E
5000|$|As {{seen in the}} picture, {{there is}} a {{distinctive}} difference between the pubic arch of a male and a female. This difference {{is found in the}} <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle.</b> The area in which the pubic arch is located is the pelvis, the area that is most different between male and female anatomy. The <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle</b> of a man is generally 50-60 degrees while that of a woman is generally 70-90 degrees. [...] A woman’s pubic arch needs to be wider in order to enable childbirth. The pelvic inlet of a female is also wider because the child’s head must pass through it. The pubic arch is also referred to as the ischiopubic arch.|$|E
50|$|The pubic arch {{is part of}} the pelvis. It {{is formed}} by the {{convergence}} of the inferior rami of the ischium and pubis on either side, below the pubic symphysis. The angle at which they converge is known as the <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E

40|$|Aims To {{test the}} null {{hypothesis}} that bony pelvis dimensions are similar in women with and without stress urinary incontinence (SUI), both in the postpartum and midlife periods. Methods Secondary analyses were performed of two case–control studies comparing women with SUI to asymptomatic controls. One study examined primiparas in the first 9 – 12 months postpartum; the other study involved middle‐aged women. SUI was confirmed by full‐bladder stress test. All subjects underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging. The interspinous and intertuberous diameters, <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle,</b> and sacrococcygeal joint‐to‐the inferior pubic point distance were measured from the images independently by two authors. Results In the young cohorts, we compared primiparas with de novo postpartum SUI to both continent primiparas and nulliparas. Postpartum SUI {{is associated with a}} wider <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle.</b> There is also a trend towards wider interspinous and intertuberous diameters in the stress‐incontinent primiparas as compared to the continent cohorts, although this did not reach statistical significance with our sample sizes. By contrast, no significant differences in bony pelvis dimensions were identified when comparing middle‐aged women with SUI and their continent controls. Conclusions Bony pelvis dimensions are different in women with SUI than in matched continent controls. However, these differences are only identified in young primiparas in the postpartum period, not in middle‐aged women. Neurourol. Urodynam. 32 : 37 – 42, 2013. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} pelvic sexual dimorphism and its functional implications in linear analyses, but few have used three-dimensional (3 D) methods, which are ideal for complex structures such as the pelvis. This study examines human and ape os coxae using 3 D geometric morphometrics (GM) to determine if patterns of sexual dimorphism relate to obstetrical and/or biomechanical requirements. Twenty-five 3 D landmarks were collected on 35 human and 116 hominoid os coxae. Generalized Procrustes and principal component analyses were performed on combined and sex-specific species samples. Tests {{of male and female}} human os coxae demonstrate dimorphism in several pelvic traits related to increasing birth canal dimensions in females; females have a wider <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle</b> and greater sciatic notch than males, as well as a short ischial spine. Hominoids, however, did not exhibit sexual dimorphism in pelvic shape. These results confirm previous studies showing that human pelvic shape dimorphism is related to the obstetrical requirements of birthing a large fetus, rather than sexual dimorphism in locomotor biomechanics. Future 3 D GM research on other primate species that have large neonates relative to maternal size may determine whether the primate pelvis exhibits similar patterns of response to obstetrical selection pressures as in humans...|$|E
40|$|Requisite to routine {{casework}} involving unidentified {{skeletal remains}} is {{the formulation of}} an accurate biological profile, including sex estimation. Choice of method(s) is invariably related to preservation and by association, available bones. It is vital that the method applied affords statistical quantification of accuracy rates and predictive confidence so that evidentiary requirements for legal submission are satisfied. Achieving the latter necessitates the application of contemporary population-specific standards. This study examines skeletal pelvic dimorphism in contemporary Western Australian individuals to quantify the accuracy of using pelvic measurements to estimate sex and to formulate a series of morphometric standards. The sample comprises pelvic multi-slice computer tomography (MSCT) scans from 200 male and 200 female adults. Following 3 D rendering, the 3 D coordinates of 24 landmarks are acquired using OsiriX® (v. 4. 1. 1) with 12 inter-landmark linear measurements and two angles acquired using MorphDb. Measurements are analysed using basic descriptive statistics and discriminant functions analyses employing jackknife validation of classification results. All except two linear measurements are dimorphic with sex differences explaining up to 65 % of sample variance. Transverse pelvic outlet and <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle</b> contribute most significantly to sex discrimination with accuracy rates between 100 % (complete pelvis- 10 variables) and 81. 2 % (ischial length). This study represents the initial forensic research into pelvic sexual dimorphism in a Western Australian population. Given these methods, we conclude that this highly dimorphic bone {{can be used to}} classify sex {{with a high degree of}} expected accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Gender {{determination}} from {{skeletal remains}} {{is one of}} the primary factors in forensic medicine. This study aimed to identify the gender of patients referred to the radiology ward of the Rasoul Akram Hospital of Tehran using anteroposterior pelvic radiography. Methods: A total of 200 patients (100 male and 100 female) referred to the radiology ward of the Rasoul Akram Hospital for anteroposterior pelvic radiography during 2013 – 2014 were included in this study. After taking a standard radiographic image of all patients in the supine position and an anteroposterior view of the pelvis, factors including subpubic angles, pubic angle, X angle, ischiopubic index, ratio of the length of the symphysis pubis to the mid and minimum width of the pubis body, and ratio of the length of the symphysis pubis to the minimum width of the pubic superior ramus were measured on radiographs. The Student t test and receiver operating characteristic curve were used to compare the data of male and female patients. Values were significant at p <  0. 05. Results: All the evaluated variables were significantly different in male and female patients (p =  0. 000), with the highest level of measurement accuracy noted in the <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle,</b> Pubic Angle 1, X angle, Pubic Angle 2, minimum width of the pubic superior ramus, and ischiopubic index. Length of the symphysis pubis, length of the pubis, and ratio of the length of the pubis to the minimum width of the pubic superior ramus showed the lowest accuracy. Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that the evaluation of the radiographic images of pelvic bones by assessing the mentioned factors can be useful for sex determination from skeletal remains. However, ethical considerations should also be taken into account while using these factors...|$|E
40|$|The pelvic {{skeleton}} {{is formed}} via endochondral ossification. However, {{it is not}} known how the normal cartilage is formed before ossification occurs. Furthermore, the overall timeline of cartilage formation and the morphology of the cartilage in the pelvis are unclear. In this study, cartilage formation in the pelvic skeletons of 25 human fetuses (crown-rump length [CRL] = 11. 9 - 75. 0 mm) was observed using phase-contrast computed tomography and 7 T magnetic resonance imaging. The chondrification center of the ilium, ischium, and pubis first appeared simultaneously at Carnegie stage (CS) 18, was located around the acetabulum, and grew radially in the later stage. The iliac crest formed at CS 20 while the iliac body's central part remained chondrified. The iliac body formed a discoid at CS 22. The growth rate was greater in the ilium than in the sacrum-coccyx, pubis, and ischium. Connection and articulation formed in a limited period, while the sacroiliac joint formed at CS 21. The articulation of the pubic symphysis, connection of the articular column in the sacrum, and Y-shape connection of the three parts of the hip bones to the acetabulum were observed at CS 23; the connection of the ischium and pubic ramus was observed at the early-fetal stage. Furthermore, the degree of connection {{at the center of the}} sacrum varied among samples. Most of the pelvimetry data showed a high correlation with CRL. The transverse and antero-posterior lengths of the pelvic inlet of the lesser pelvis varied among samples (R 2 = 0. 11). The <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle</b> also varied (65 - 90 °) and was not correlated with CRL (R 2 = 0. 22). Moreover, cartilaginous structure formation appeared to influence bone structure. This study provides valuable information regarding the morphogenesis of the pelvic structure...|$|E
40|$|The pelvis, {{the most}} sexually dimorphic {{area of the}} adult human skeleton, is {{essential}} to determine biological sex. Although sex differences have been noted in subadult pelvic bones since the late 1800 s, no reliable method has been developed to determine biological sex, and therefore, subadult sex demographics must be omitted from forensic and archaeological investigations. This study examined three North American skeletal samples of documented age and sex, the Forensic Fetal Osteological Collection (n= 113), the subadult component of the Hamann-Todd Collection (n= 37), and the Trotter Fetal Bone Collection (n= 37), {{to test the hypothesis}} that subadult pelvic traits, both metric and non-metric, are sufficiently sexually dimorphic in one or more sample or age category. Method accuracy and reliability were also evaluated. Traits included those previously studied: the breadth and angle of the sciatic notch, iliac crest curvature, arch criterion, auricular surface elevation, <b>subpubic</b> <b>angle,</b> pubic length, and ischial length. Two additional feature analyses and three indices were developed for this study: the anterior and posterior sciatic notch lengths, pubic body width, pubic index, anterior/posterior sciatic notch, and sciatic notch width/iliac length index. Both left and right sides were considered using photographic and direct measurement techniques. For t-tests and correlations, at least one trait per sample reached statistically significant levels for sexual dimorphism. Reliable testing methods were not developed because these features were inconsistently sexually dimorphic for each sample; furthermore, male and female measurement ranges overlapped considerably, trait morphology proved variable, and individuals were incorrectly assigned to sex when using methods outlined in previous studies. Both logistic regression and discriminant function analysis provided low predictive scores, the highest at 0. 68, which were insufficient to predict sex consistently or meet the Daubert threshold. Two non-metric traits, sciatic notch shape and auricular surface elevation, also proved to be inconsistent across the three samples. Consequently, these traits were unreliable for sex determination. Several features, including the sciatic notch width, sciatic notch shape, and pubic body width, demonstrated differences among older subadults and should be investigated using larger, broadly-aged samples that include adults...|$|E
