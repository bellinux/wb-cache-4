For the new buildings a suitable code can be followed and the material and the technology can give an effective contribution to the seismic resistance of the structure. On the contrary, for the old masonry monument only a reliable structural analysis and some specific and not much invasive retrofitting can be adopted. In this context, towers are a very interesting case study because highly vulnerable to horizontal actions, but also because more emblematic to study some peculiar aspects of the material behavior.

Self-consolidating concrete (SCC), which {{is different from}} conventional concrete especially in its fresh state, is a highly workable concrete that flows through congested reinforcement under its own weight alone, filling the formwork without segregation of its constituent materials with a void-free structure, and can be placed without any vibration. Self-consolidating concrete was first developed in Japan in the early 1980 s, and the main issues that promoted the development of SCC were the shortage of skilled labor {{and the emergence of}} heavily reinforced structures that made it difficult to sufficiently consolidate the concrete which is crucial for its durability. Although some raw materials and chemical admixtures may increase the initial cost, its use is on the rise worldwide for precast concrete construction mainly due to its ease of placement over conventional concrete. Some benefits of using SCC for precast concrete applications are easily quantified such as faster construction, reduced noise level, and improved surface finish which eliminates the need for patching. Other less tangible benefits include worker safety improvements and extended life of the precasting forms. Although SCC has been developed and successfully used for numerous precast and cast-in-place applications worldwide, and both fresh and hardened properties of SCC have been investigated, concerns have remained regarding mix proportioning, acceptance criteria of SCC in its plastic state, and long term behavior (e. g., creep and shrinkage) of SCC precast/pretensioned elements in service. Limited literature is available to evaluate the hardened and long-term behavior of SCC members, particularly creep, shrinkage, and elastic modulus. Furthermore, there is a wide variation in the findings regarding the long-term behavior of SCC. Due to these reasons, many state departments of transportation, including the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT), have been hesitant to allow SCC for precast bridge girder applications. This study was initiated with the intent to investigate the viability of using SCC developed at local precast plants with locally available materials for the construction of precast prestressed SCC girders in the State of Minnesota. The primary objective of the research was to determine both short-term and long-term properties of SCC bridge girders, evaluate the applicability and accuracy of available test procedures, design equations, and material models for SCC bridge girders. The research was divided into several phases. In the first phase, SCC trial mixes were developed using locally available materials from two local precast concrete plants (Plant-A and Plan-B). The developed trial SCC mixes were studied to identify the main parameters that affect the performance of SCC in its fresh state (e. g., flowability and segregation resistance) such as cement, high-range water reducing admixture dosage, and fresh concrete temperature. It was found that variations in cement from the same supplier with no difference in the cement mill report can significantly affect the flowability of SCC, and recommendations were included for the effect of concrete temperature and admixture dosage on fresh concrete properties. In addition, a testing program was undertaken to evaluate the static and dynamic one-dimensional free flow and flow through reinforcing obstacle segregation resistances of SCC and passing ability of coarse aggregate through reinforcing obstacles. Correlations between different test results were investigated to minimize the required number of test methods to adequately evaluate SCC mixtures. The next phase involved casting four SCC and two conventional concrete precast prestressed bridge girders using locally available materials from Plant-A and Plant-B (three girders per plant). The girders were Mn/DOT 36 M I-girders with a span length of 38 ft, and design concrete compressive strengths of 7. 5 ksi at release and 9. 0 ksi at 28 days. The girders were designed incorporating 36 straight strands in the bottom flange, and four strands in the top flange to avoid the need to drape strands (total of 40 strands). This large amount of prestressed strand was used to create a situation with congested reinforcement to challenge the SCC flow. In addition, the large amount of prestress maximized the allowable compressive stresses at release in the bottom concrete fiber to maximize the concrete creep. The section represented one of the most severe cases for the application of SCC. In addition to the girders, companion cylinders were cast to monitor compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, creep, and shrinkage over time. The girders were instrumented and stored in an outdoor storage site for a period of approximately 2 years to monitor both short-term and long-term performance, which included transfer length, camber, and prestress losses. Both short-term (e. g., elastic shortening) and long-term performance of the girders (e. g., prestress losses) were measured and compared to AASHTO (2004 and 2007), PCI Design Handbook 6 th Edition (2004), and PCI General Method (PCI, 1975) predictions. The results indicated that the predicted total long-term prestress losses calculated with AASHTO 2004, PCI Design Handbook 6 th Edition (2004), and PCI General Method (PCI, 1975) using measured material properties obtained from conventional cylinders were conservative for both SCC and conventional concrete girders (Note that the SCC conventional cylinders were fabricated with a slightly modified process; rather than rodding the cylinders after each lift, the sides of the mold were tapped with a rubber mallet). The predicted long-term losses {{at the end of the}} monitoring periods (i. e., approximately 600 days and 450 days for Plant-A and Plant-B, respectively) were larger than measured losses by 2 to 5 % for AASHTO 2004 Lump Sum Method, 12 to 15 % for AASHTO 2004 Refined Method, 4 to 7 % for PCI General Method, and 8 to 11 % for PCI Design Handbook Method for all girders. However, the long-term prestress losses computed with AASHTO- 2007 (Approximate Estimate of Time-Dependent Losses) were either not conservative or very close to the measured losses for both the SCC and conventional concrete girders at the end of the monitoring periods. The magnitude of the difference between the measured and predicted losses was comparable for both the conventional and SCC girders. Finally the girders were tested in three-point bending to determine the cracking and crack re-opening loads at the University of Minnesota Structures Laboratory. The experimentally measured crack re-opening loads were used to indirectly calculate the remaining effective prestressing forces and total prestress losses. Also, a <b>semi-destructive</b> <b>test</b> method was used to experimentally measure the remaining tendon forces to verify the field measured losses. The measured girder prestress losses were compared to those determined from a fiber-based finite element analysis incorporating time-dependent creep and shrinkage models based on companion cylinder data. The measured, predicted, and calculated prestress losses were generally in good agreement. The study indicated that creep and shrinkage material models developed based on measured companion cylinder creep and shrinkage data can be used to reasonably predict measured field prestress losses of both conventional and SCC prestressed bridge girders...|$|E

This PEG (Poly Ethylene Glycol) treatment prevented the ship from serious shrinkage and distortion that would have caused collapse of the cell walls. These degradation processes have diminishing effects on the strength and stiffness of the ship structure, such as decreasing bearing capacity, loss of cross sectional area and global deformations. During the last 10 years, the focus was on the mechanical properties of Vasa oak and the influence of PEG penetration in oak, but no final decisions were made on whether to strengthen or how to support the structure. A conversion of a three-dimensional ship model to model the real structural behaviour might raise difficulties due to the complexity of the material properties that are needed for input. Therefore, a global non-destructive assessment of the mechanical properties combined with <b>semi-destructive</b> <b>tests</b> to predict both strength and stiffness parameters of the Vasa oak as input information are of great importance. Since density has a significant relationship with the mechanical properties of timber and the non-destructive parameters often relate to density, the main aim of the paper was to compare the applicability of property prediction through non-destructive and <b>semi-destructive</b> <b>testing.</b> Particularly, portable X-ray equipment was used in this study to achieve accurate density measurements on-site which are valuable for model updating purposes as well as to establish a relationship of the influence of stiffness parameters and PEG to the X-ray density.

The proposed procedure can be used in-situ with satisfactory results for the evaluation of timber properties. The negative influence of the PEG content resulted in slight overestimation of the density which is on the safe side for the evaluation of the load-carrying capacity. The correlation between the indicative stiffness and the density properties was weak, but good agreement of the density properties was reached through cross correlation between PEG and the density properties, and PEG and the indicative stiffness parameters...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In the {{assessment}} of timber structures, diagnostic investigations of the structural members and connections are generally necessary. The assessment often requires appropriate non-destructive <b>testing</b> (NDT) and <b>semi-destructive</b> <b>testing</b> (SDT) techniques. Improved, new methods based on scientific knowledge and guidelines are needed for their application, so the principal goal of the project is to develop guidelines and recommendations on how to perform assessment of existing timber structures with reference to their condition and structural capability, as well as assessment strategies. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, the research focused on the development of an X-ray image calibration procedure, which enables the determination of density properties for the in-situ assessment of timber structures. This non-destructive method is useful for evaluating the internal condition, since wood density has a strong relationship with several mechanical properties. An X-ray procedure to calibrate for the influence of significant density differences in wood specimens, thickness and moisture was applied, which the images were analysed and evaluated. Finally, a calibration wedge was set up to verify the procedure on timber beam specimens, resulting in good agreement and an average accuracy of ~ 97 %. The values obtained from the image calibration resulted in very good linear correlation between the measured density and the greyscale from X-ray images. The main advantage compared with conventional techniques is the detection and quantification of the internal condition of timber that may reduce the mechanical properties of the structure. This study shows good potential when it comes to the development of a viable tool for in-situ assessments of timber structures and could be used indirectly in analyses of structural behaviour. In the second part, the research focused on a systematic in-situ assessment strategy of the Vasa warship, including the prediction of the density, the stiffness properties and the influence of PEG (Poly Ethylene Glycol). This was made possible by combining non-destructive in-situ testing techniques, particularly X-ray, with mechanical and chemical tests. A global non-destructive assessment of the mechanical properties is needed to predict both the strength and stiffness of the Vasa oak. The proposed procedure can be used in situ with satisfactory results for the evaluation of timber properties. A conversion of a three-dimensional ship model from the Vasa warship to model the real structural behaviour might create difficulties due to the complexity of the material properties that are needed for input. The PEG content clearly has a negative influence on the strength and stiffness properties. Satisfactory agreement between the density and stiffness properties was reached through cross-correlation to PEG content.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effects of thermal {{stresses}} on selected carbonate rocks used as dimension stones. They are Mesozoic calcareous and dolomitic rocks cropping out in Apulia (southern Italy) that, for their physico-mechanical and aesthetic properties, have always been finding a large application both as ornamental stones and as simple construction materials; their use is attested not only in Italy, in works of archaeological, historical and artistic interest too. The cause–effect relationships of thermal degradation were studied by means of an artificial accelerated ageing test, in order to provide a perspective about the decay of carbonate stones due to diurnal and seasonal temperature fluctuations, as well as thermal shocks during events of fire development. The stone samples were subjected to thermal cycles in a muffle furnace, ranging from 100 to 700 °C; after each cycle, several non-destructive and <b>semi-destructive</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out: mass and volume measurements, mercury intrusion porosimetry, sclerometer tests, ultrasonic tests, thin-section observations and determination of chromatic alterations through image analysis and Munsell charts method. In this way, the qualitative and quantitative modifications induced in fabric, physical and mechanical properties were discussed. The results highlight the fundamental role of depositional and diagenetic fabric that, together with mineralogical composition, represents the most significant discriminating factor in the response of the stone to thermal stresses...|$|R
40|$|Some {{structural}} {{issues concerning}} {{the preservation of}} built historic heritage are presented and discussed in this paper. In spite of the great amount of theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies {{made in the last}} decades, the designers involved in structural rehabilitation have been so far mostly spectators in the drawing of the guidelines and provisions that are nowadays the basis for any judgment by the heritage authority in approving rehabilitation proposals. Structural safety, however, is becoming a top priority, mostly because of some recent seismic events. As a consequence, to improve structural safety under seismic loading, a number of research projects has been recently focused on the mechanical properties of traditional materials, having in mind the following tenet, that the original structural behavior, the original texture and even past modifications (if any) of the construction should be respected, as much as possible. Hence, the need and urgency to save the architectural heritage (by increasing significantly the safety factors) is emphasized in this paper, to avoid wasting past investments and to optimize future investments. As an example, at least the following two steps should be taken: (a) revised policies for non-destructive <b>testing</b> (NDT) and <b>semi-destructive</b> <b>testing</b> (SMT), to properly evaluate the mechanical properties of the constructions to be repaired; and (b) improved mathematical models to predict realistically and in a designer-friendly way the structural behavior of heritage constructions.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of existing timber structures is often limited to information obtained from non or semi destructive testing, as mechanical testing {{is in many}} cases not possible due to its destructive nature. Therefore, the available data provides only an indirect measurement of the reference mechanical properties of timber elements, often obtained through empirical based correlations. Moreover, the data must result from the combination of different tests, as to provide a reliable source of information for a structural analysis. Even if general guidelines are available for each typology of testing, {{there is still a}} need for a global methodology allowing to combine information from different sources and infer upon that information in a decision process. In this scope, the present work presents the implementation of a probabilistic based framework for safety {{assessment of}} existing timber elements. This methodology combines information gathered in different scales and follows a probabilistic framework allowing for the structural assessment of existing timber elements with possibility of inference and updating of its mechanical properties, through Bayesian methods. The probabilistic based framework is based in four main steps: (i) scale of information; (ii) measurement data; (iii) probability assignment; and (iv) structural analysis. In this work, the proposed methodology is implemented in a case study. Data was obtained through a multi-scale experimental campaign made to old chestnut timber beams accounting correlations of non and <b>semi-destructive</b> <b>tests</b> with mechanical properties.

For their physico-mechanical and aesthetic properties, these sedimentary rocks have always found a large application both as ornamental stones and as simple construction materials, particurarly in military architecture and worship buildings during the Middle Ages. The Apulian “marbles” are characterised by high strength and durability, nevertheless outdoors exposure often involves significant changes in their technical properties and state of conservation caused by weathering. The effects of thermal stresses on the material performances, due to diurnal and seasonal temperature fluctuations, constitute a topic of particular interest {{in the assessment of}} durability problems associated to long-term exposure. In this work, a study about changes in technical properties of the Apulian ornamental limestones and dolostones induced by thermal stresses is presented. Direct and indirect evaluations concerning index properties, mechanical strength, deformability, textural characteristics and chromatic features, on samples subjected to thermal cycles, were used for providing a comprehensive perspective about deterioration, from the mesoscopic scale to the microscopic one.
