40|$|Objective. To {{estimate}} {{the incidence of}} work-related diseases, injuries, and complaints in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao and to identify some next steps in the prevention process. Methods. All of the three countries' 18 occupational health specialists were asked to participate; 100 % agreed to report all work-related diseases, injuries, and complaints in 2004 - 2008. A <b>standard</b> online <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> was used to register cases in a database maintained by the Netherlands Center for Occupational Diseases (NCOD). The public health service of Curacao analyzed the data and presented the results to the participating physicians during educational and feedback meetings. Results. During the study period, 1 519 cases were reported: 720 (47. 0 %) work-related diseases; 515 (34. 0 %) injuries; and 284 (19. 0 %) complaints. The mean patient age was 42. 4 years (range 16 - 70 years); 924 (60. 8 %) were males and 571 (37. 6 %), females. Most frequently reported were musculoskeletal diseases, injuries, and complaints; mental health disorders; and skin injuries. Analysis showed incidence rates of work-related diseases, injuries, and complaints in Aruba to be 157 new cases per 100 000 employee years; in Bonaire, 53 / 100 000; and in Curacao, 437 / 100 000. Conclusions. These results suggest that labor protection laws need improvement and that preventive action should be fostered. Further study is needed on working conditions, preventive policy, {{and the quality of}} occupational health and safety practices in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao. Funding is imperative for collecting and publishing accurate data, which will keep this problem on the social-political agend...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{discharge}} planning {{is important to}} ensuring a high quality of patient care and operational efficiency. The general internal medicine (GIM) environment is very complex and fluid, with multiple health professions providing care for patients. This makes coordination of discharges difficult, even with structured daily interprofessional rounds. The purpose of this case-control study was to evaluate a discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> that predicts next-day discharges. The main measures of the study, {{which took place in}} GIM wards at two academic teaching hospitals, were the completion and accuracy of the discharge forms, length of stay, discharge times, post-discharge admissions, and emergency department visits. Seventy-six of 200 patients studied had information completed on the discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form.</b> The overall effect appeared to move discharges earlier in the day, while having no effect on length of stay. Patients whose information was completed on the discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> were less likely to have an emergency department visit within 30 days post-discharge. The use of a discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> appears to move discharges earlier in the day, without increasing length of stay.

The sources of abortion data (<b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> established in 1975 and hospital statistics since the mid- 1990 s) do not agree. Given the incomplete nature of the <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> data, INED previously produced estimates of the total number: 250, 000 abortions in 1976, 262, 000 in 1980, 230, 000 in 1987 and 225, 000 in 1993. According to the hospital statistics, elective abortions totalled 180, 500 in 1994 and 206, 500 in 2003.

The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the PCIs, required precautions, and applications after the injuries among healthcare workers in a small general hospital. Materials and methods: We assessed the occurrence of PCIs at a General Hospital (EGH) from January 2007 to Novem-ber 2010. During this period, all injury cases among HCWs were reported to the Infection Control Committee (ICC) using percutaneous injury <b>notification</b> <b>form.</b> The injury <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Totally 275 health personnel were working in our hospital, 36 healthy workers have been exposed to PCIs during this period. The incidence of PCIs was 2, 9 / 10000 in 2007, 3, 1 / 10000 in 2008, 3, 8 / 10000 in 2009 and 3, 9 / 10000 patient-days in 2010.

METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional {{study of the}} data from prescription <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> and balance lists of drugs sales â€“ psychoactive and others â€“ subject to special control in the fifth largest city of Brazil, in 2006. We determined the defined and prescribed daily doses, the average prescription and dispensation periods, and the regional sales distribution in the municipality. In addition, we estimated the costs of drug acquisition and analyzed the individual drug consumption profile using the Lorenz curve. RESULTS The balance lists data covered all notified sales of the drug while data from prescription <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> covered 50. 6 % of the pharmacies that sold it, including those with the highest sales volumes. Total methylphenidate consumption was 0. 37 DDD/ 1, 000 inhabitants/day. Sales were concentrated in more developed areas, and regular-release tablets were the most commonly prescribed pharmaceutical formulation. In some regions of the city, approximately 20. 0 % of the prescriptions and dispensation exceeded 30 mg/day and 30 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS Methylphenidate was widely consumed in the municipality and mainly in the most developed areas. Of note, the consumption of formulations with the higher abuse risk was the most predominant. Both its prescription and dispensation contrasted with current pharmacotherapeutic recommendations and legal requirements. Therefore, the commercialization of methylphenidate should be monitored more closely, and its use {{in the treatment of}} behavioral changes of psychological disorders needs to be discussed in detail, in line with the concepts of the quality use of medicines...|$|R
