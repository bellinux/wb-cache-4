To define the biological significance of these P 450 scc-initiated pathways, we tested the effects of their 5, 7 -diene precursors and secosteroidal products on leukemia cell differentiation and proliferation in comparison to 1 a, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3). These <b>secosteroids</b> inhibited proliferation and induced erythroid differentiation of K 562 human chronic myeloid and MEL mouse leukemia cells with 20 (OH) D 3 and 20, 23 (OH) 2 D 3 being either equipotent or slightly less potent than 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, while 1, 20 (OH) 2 D 3, pD and pL compounds were slightly or moderately less potent.

40|$|A central {{paradox of}} vitamin D biology is that 1 α, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 {{exposure}} inversely relates to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk despite {{a capacity for}} activation of both pro- and anti-oncogenic mediators including osteopontin (OPN) /CD 44 and E-cadherin, respectively. Most sporadic CRCs arise from adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutation but understanding of its effects on vitamin D growth control is limited. Here we investigate effects of the ApcMin/+ genotype on 1 α, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 regulation of OPN/CD 44 /E-cadherin signalling and intestinal tumourigenesis, in vivo. In untreated ApcMin/+ versus Apc+/+ intestines, expression levels of OPN and its CD 44 receptor were increased, whereas E-cadherin tumour suppressor signalling was attenuated. Treatment by 1 α, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 or rationally designed analogues (QW or BTW) enhanced OPN but inhibited expression of CD 44, the OPN receptor implicated in cell growth. These treatments also enhanced E-cadherin tumour suppressor activity, characterized by inhibition of β-catenin nuclear localization, T-cell factor 1 and c-myelocytomatosis protein expression in ApcMin/+ intestine. All secosteroids suppressed ApcMin/+-driven tumourigenesis although QW and BTW had lower calcium-related toxicity. Taken together, these data indicate that the ApcMin/+ genotype modulates vitamin D <b>secosteroid</b> actions to promote functional predominance of E-cadherin tumour suppressor activity within antagonistic molecular networks.

40|$|Our {{laboratory}} {{has previously}} demonstrated that 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1, 25 [OH] 2 D 3) rapidly stimulated polyphosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, raised intracellular Ca 2 +, and activated two Ca 2 +-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, PKC-alpha and -betaII in the rat large intestine. We {{also showed that}} the direct addition of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 to isolated colonic membranes failed to stimulate PI hydrolysis, but required <b>secosteroid</b> treatment of intact colonocytes, suggesting the involvement of a soluble factor. Furthermore, this PI hydrolysis was restricted to the basal lateral plasma membrane of these cells. In the present studies, therefore, we examined whether polyphosphoinositide-phospholipase C-gamma (PI-PLC-gamma), a predominantly cytosolic isoform of PI-PLC, {{was involved in the}} hydrolysis of colonic membrane PI by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. This isoform {{has been shown to be}} activated and membrane-associated by tyrosine phosphorylation. We found that 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 caused a significant increase in the biochemical activity, particulate association, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma, specifically in the basal lateral membranes. This <b>secosteroid</b> also induced a twofold increase in the activity of Src, a proximate activator of PLC-gamma in other cells, with peaks at 1 and 9 min in association with Src tyrosine dephosphorylation. 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 also increased the physical association of activated c-Src with PLC-gamma. In addition, Src isolated from colonocytes treated with 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, demonstrated an increased ability to phosphorylate exogenous PLC-gamma in vitro. Inhibition of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 -induced Src activation by PP 1, a specific Src family protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked the ability of this <b>secosteroid</b> to stimulate the translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma in the basolateral membrane (BLM). Src activation was lost in D deficiency, and was reversibly restored with the in vivo repletion of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3.

The focus of this thesis was to identify the structural determinants of 3 α-HSD catalysis and steroid binding as a guide to inhibitor design. Crystallographic studies of 3 α-HSD have led to the proposal of a catalytic mechanism in which Y 55 acts as a general acid and its pK value may be lowered by K 84 and D 50. Characterization of site-directed mutants suggest that Y 55 makes the largest contribution to the chemical mechanism for steroid oxidoreduction, whereas the major contribution of K 84 and H 117 is to steroid binding. ^ Surprisingly, the Y 55 mutants were efficient catalysts of 9, 10 -phenanthrenequinone reduction. This is the first report whereby the invariant catalytic tyrosine in the AKRs has been mutated with retention of robust enzyme activity. The unique substrate specificity of Y 55 mutants for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon o-quinones is reminiscent of ζ-crystallin, an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) which lacks a catalytic zinc atom. This suggests a common functional role for tyrosine and zinc, possibly through the stabilization of an oxyanion transition state. A comparison of the active site residues from 3 α-HSD, ADH, 3 α, 20 β-HSD, lactate dehydrogenase and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase showed that (1) the C 4 of the nicotinamide ring, (2) the tyrosine oxygen/zinc atom and (3) a histidine/threonine/serine side-chain are positionally conserved, despite a lack of sequence identity. These comparisons illustrate active site convergence in five structurally distinct classes of dehydrogenases. ^ To identify regions of the enzyme involved in steroid hormone recognition, I employed mechanism-based inactivators. Secosteroids which contain latent Michael acceptors (α,β-unsaturated alcohols) at opposite ends of the steroid nucleus inactivated 3 α-HSD only in the presence of NAD+. The chemically prepared products of <b>secosteroid</b> oxidation (α,β-unsaturated carbonyls) behaved as stoichiometric inactivators. These results demonstrated backwards binding of <b>secosteroid</b> substrates, and their turnover to reactive acetylenic ketones which alkylate 3 α-HSD.
