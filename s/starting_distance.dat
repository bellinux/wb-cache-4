40|$|Escape theory predicts flight {{initiation}} distance (FID, predator-to-prey distance when escape begins) {{based on}} fixed functions relating {{costs and benefits}} of fleeing to distance between a prey and an approaching predator. Theory accurately predicts effects of costs for fixed functions and changes in functions due to changes in predator behavior approach. Less obvious is how the effect of <b>starting</b> <b>distance</b> (predator-to-prey distance when approach begins) on FID can be explained when predator behavior does not change during approach. We simulated predators to study effects of <b>starting</b> <b>distance</b> on FID in Balearic lizards (Podarcis lilfordi). <b>Starting</b> <b>distance</b> and approach speed affected FID interactively. It increased as <b>starting</b> <b>distance</b> increased during faster, but not slower, approaches. Because risk functions are considered fixed for a given approach speed, we must explain why FID varies with <b>starting</b> <b>distance,</b> why only for rapid approach, and how risk is assessed. Because prey approached slowly assess risk as small until the predator is very close, approach from greater distance has little effect on risk curves. Because continued rapid approach suggests that the predator has detected the prey and is attacking, not merely approaching, risk varies with <b>starting</b> <b>distance.</b> Theoretical difficulty in explaining the effect of <b>starting</b> <b>distance</b> on FID disappears if risk curves vary among starting distances at faster approach speeds, but each curve is fixed. This might occur if prey use a temporal rule of thumb assigning increasing risk as duration of rapid approach increases. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{causes of}} animal-vehicle collisions are unclear, {{particularly at the}} level of animal detection of approaching vehicles and decision-making. Deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) are especially costly in terms of animal mortality, property damage, and safety. Over one year, we exposed free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to vehicle approach under low ambient light conditions, from varying <b>start</b> <b>distances,</b> and vehicle speeds from 20 km/h to approximately 90 km/ h. We modeled flight response by deer to an approaching vehicle and tested four hypotheses: 1) flight-initiation distance (FID) would correlate positively with <b>start</b> <b>distance</b> (indicating a spatial margin of safety); 2) deer would react to vehicle speed using a temporal margin of safety; 3) individuals reacting at greater FIDs {{would be more likely to}} cross the path of the vehicle; and 4) crossings would correlate positively with <b>start</b> <b>distance,</b> approach speed, and distance to concealing/refuge cover. We examined deer responses by quantiles. Median FID was 40 % of <b>start</b> <b>distance,</b> irrespective of <b>start</b> <b>distance</b> or approach speed. Converting FID to time-to-collision (TTC), median TTC was 4. 6 s, but uncorrelated with <b>start</b> <b>distance</b> or approach speed. The likelihood of deer crossing in front of the vehicle was not associated with greater FIDs or other explanatory variables. Because deer flight response to vehicle approach was highly variable, DVCs should be more likely with increasing vehicle speeds because of lower TTCs for a given distance. For road sections characterized by frequent DVCs, we recommend estimating TTC relative to vehicle speed and candidate line-of-sight distances adjusted downward b...|$|R

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} escape {{behavior}} are predictable by escape theory based on expected costs due to predation risk and escaping. Although {{the function of}} pursuit-deterrent signaling is to dissuade predators from attack, relatively {{little is known about}} relationships between specific components of escape and the signaling behavior. I studied effects of the risk factor distance from refuge on flight initiation distance, distance fled, probability of entering refuge, and the distance between predator (an approaching human) and prey when pursuit-deterrent display begins (display distance) in the Cuban curly-tailed lizard (Leiocephalus carinatus). I also investigated whether <b>starting</b> <b>distance</b> (distance between predator and prey when approach begins) affects escape behaviors. As predicted by escape theory, flight initiation distance and distance fled were greater and refuge entry was less probable at greater distance from refuge, indicating that qualitative predictions of escape theory apply to pursuit deterrent signalers. <b>Starting</b> <b>distance</b> did not affect escape behaviors, presumably because it did not affect perceived risk, but might do so at a faster approach speed. Display distance and flight initiation distance were identical in the data set analyzed, but individuals sometimes perform tail displays prior to fleeing.

40|$|Eye-movement {{patterns}} are often utilized {{in studies of}} visual perception as indices of the specific information extracted to efficiently process a given stimulus during a given task. Our prior work, however, revealed that not only the stimulus and task influence eye-movements, but that visuomotor (start position) factors also robustly and characteristically influence eye-movement patterns to faces (Arizpe, et al, 2012). Here we manipulated lateral starting side and distance from the midline of face and line-symmetrical control (butterfly) stimuli {{in order to further}} investigate the nature and generality of such visuomotor influences. First we found that increasing <b>starting</b> <b>distance</b> from midline (4, 8, 12, 16 degrees visual angle) strongly and proportionately increased the distance of the first ordinal fixation from midline. We did not find influences of <b>starting</b> <b>distance</b> on subsequent fixations, however, suggesting that eye-movement plans are not strongly affected by <b>starting</b> <b>distance</b> following an initial orienting fixation. Further, we replicated our prior effect of starting side (left, right) to induce a spatially contralateral tendency of fixations after the first ordinal fixation. However, we also established that these visuomotor influences did not depend upon the predictability of the location of the upcoming stimulus, and were present not only for face stimuli but also for our control stimulus category (butterflies). We found a correspondence in overall left-lateralized fixation tendency between faces and butterflies. Finally, for faces, we found a relationship between left starting side (right sided fixation pattern tendency) and increased recognition performance, which likely reflects a cortical right hemisphere (left visual hemifield) advantage for face perception. These results further indicate the importance of considering and controlling for visuomotor influences in the design, analysis, and interpretation of eye-movement studies...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study {{examined}} the effects of manipulating relative positioning between defenders (initial distance apart) on emergent decision-making and actions in a 1 vs. 2 rugby union performance sub-phase. Design: Twelve experienced youth players performed 80 trials of a 1 (attacker) vs. 2 (defenders) practice task in which the <b>starting</b> <b>distance</b> between defenders was systematically decreased. Methods: Movement displacement trajectories of participants were video recorded to obtain 2 D positional data. The independent variable was the <b>starting</b> <b>distance</b> between defenders and dependent variables were: (i) performance outcome (try or tackle), (ii) mean speed of all players during performance, and (iii), time between the first crossover {{and the end of the}} trial. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the effects of different starting distances on performance. Results: Shorter starting distances between defenders were associated with a higher frequency of effective tackle outcomes, lower mean speeds of all participants, and a greater time period between the first crossover and the end of the trial. Conclusions: Decision-making behaviours emerged as a function of changes in participants’ spatial location during performance. This observation supports the importance of manipulating key spatial-temporal variables in designing representative practice task constraints that induce functional player-environment interactions in team sports training. © 2011 Sports Medicine Australia.

However, studies of whole brain size in this context have been criticised for ignoring the role of specific brain areas in controlling behaviour. In birds, the response to potential threats is one such behaviour that may relate {{to the way in which}} the brain processes sensory information. We used a phylogenetic generalised least squares (PGLS) analyses, based on five different phylogenetic hypotheses, to analyse the relationship of relative sizes of whole brain and brain components with Flight-Initiation Distance (FID), the distance at which birds flee from an approaching human, for 41 bird species. <b>Starting</b> <b>distance</b> (the distance at which an approach to a bird commences), body mass and eye size have elsewhere been shown to be positively associated with FID, and consequently were included as covariates in our analysis. <b>Starting</b> <b>distance</b> and body mass were by far the strongest predictors of FID. Of all brain components, cerebellum size had the strongest predictor weight and was negatively associated with FID but the confidence intervals on the average estimate included zero and the overall predictor weight was low. Models featuring individual brain components were generally more strongly weighted than models featuring whole brain size. The PGLS analyses estimated there to be no phylogenetic signal in the regression models, and hence produced results equivalent to ordinary least squares regression analysis. However analyses that assumed strong phylogenetic signal produced substantially different results with each phylogeny, and overall suggest a negative relationship between forebrai...|$|E
