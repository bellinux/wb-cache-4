50|$|A simple {{example of}} a <b>structured</b> <b>note</b> would be a five-year bond tied {{together}} with an option contract.

This makes it possible to invest in an asset class that would otherwise be considered too risky.|$|E
5000|$|From the investor's {{point of}} view, a <b>structured</b> <b>note</b> {{might look like}} this: I agree to a three-year {{contract}} with a bank. I give the bank $100. The money will be indexed to the S&P 500. In three years, if the S&P has gone up, the bank will pay me $100 plus the gain in the S&P. However, if the S&P has gone down, the bank will pay me back the entire $100 - an advantage known as downside protection. (In reality the downside protection is usually [...] "contingent", i.e. it only applies {{up to a certain}} threshold amount. For example, with a threshold of 40%, if the S&P has gone down by more than 40%, the bank will no longer pay me back $100, but instead it will pay me the proportional value indexed to the S&P - e.g. $55 if the S&P has gone down by 45%.

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{circumstances}} under which speculative attacks on the currency board of Hong Kong occurred during the Asian financial turmoil. It argues that interest rate arbitrage as a defense mechanism would not function properly unless the risk premium of holding Hong Kong dollar could be reduced by restoration of confidence. A proposal to issue <b>structured</b> <b>notes,</b> or put options to strengthen the currency board is made. Arguments for and against the proposal are reviewed. We show that the "technical " measures eventually undertaken by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are analytically equivalent to issuing the <b>structured</b> <b>notes.</b> Empirical tests indicate that interest rate arbitrage had been working properly until the rule-bound currency board had been eroded by discretion introduced by the Monetary Authority. However, after implementing the <b>structured</b> <b>notes</b> proposal, interest rate arbitrage appeared to be effective again. JEL Classification: E 42, E 58, F 41...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} 310 <b>structured</b> <b>note</b> lawsuits in Taiwan between 2000 and 2013 {{to examine}} courts’ attitude {{in dealing with}} claims of misselling retail structured notes. We find that courts were generally not favorable to retail investors. This provides a contrast with the financial regulator’s efforts to improve financial consumer protection since 2008. By examining plaintiffs’ key arguments and courts’ rulings, we find {{that it was difficult}} for investors to fulfill their burden of proof and courts were reluctant to award remedies when investors did sign on a contractual document confirming his knowledge on a few matters. While regulators are right to strengthen financial consumer protection, this article argues that Taiwan courts’ inactivism to protect retail investors could be justified. However, regulators should pick up from what courts have left to ensure that customers fully comprehend the consequences when they sign on contractual documents, to avoid banks classifying customers as active investors too easily, and to clarify banks’ duties toward a customer after a contract is signed. Regulators should also reconsider its regulatory structure to ensure foreign banks {{would not be able to}} issue securities to raise funds from local investors by way of a shadow banking system...|$|E
40|$|The <b>structured</b> <b>note</b> {{market has}} {{recently}} been a large and {{important part of the}} personal financial landscape. These notes offer investors exposure to asset classes and investment themes that they may find difficult to access in other ways. Particularly in Europe and Asia, these markets grew rapidly until the financial market disruptions of 2008. While earlier research papers have investigated the performance of small samples of specific types of notes, analysis of performance and issuance patterns across the entire marketplace has not kept pace with market growth. This paper investigates issuance and performance patterns, using a broad sample based on more than 1, 000, 000 individual note issues. Patterns of issuance suggest that investors chase performance, and issuers prefer to issue notes whose underlying risks are easier for them to hedge. Taken as a whole, estimated performance of the notes suggests that they are sold at a significant premium. Premium estimates over the entire period are close to the estimates in Henderson and Pearson (2007), which were based on a small sample of one type of note. There is significant variation across time period, with the measured premium falling significantly in the period since 2005...|$|E

40|$|A multifactorial {{approach}} {{to assess and}} manage modifiable risk factors is recommended for older adults {{with a history of}} falls. Limited research suggests that this approach does not routinely occur in clinical practice, but most related studies are based on provider self-report, with the last chart audit of United States practice published over a decade ago. We conducted a retrospective chart review to assess the extent to which patients aged 65 + with a history of repeated falls or fall-related healthcare use received multifactorial risk assessment and interventions. The setting was an academic primary care clinic in the Pacific Northwest. Among the 116 patients meeting our inclusion criteria, 48 % had some type of documented assessment. Their mean age was 79 ± 8 years; 68 % were female, and 10 % were non-white. They averaged 6 primary care visits over a 12 -month period subsequent to their index fall. Frequency of assessment of fall risk factors varied from 24 % (for home safety) to 78 % (for vitamin D). An evidence-based intervention was recommended for identified risk factors 73 % of the time, on average. Two risk factors were addressed infrequently: medications (21 %) and home safety (24 %). Use of a structured visit note template independently predicted assessment of fall risk factors (P= 0. 003). Geriatrics specialists were more likely to use a <b>structured</b> <b>note</b> template (p=. 04) and perform more fall risk factor assessments (4. 6 vs. 3. 6, p=. 007) than general internists. These results suggest opportunities for improving multifactorial fall risk assessment and management of older adults at high fall risk in primary care. A structured visit note template facilitates assessment. Given that high-risk medications {{have been found to be}} independent risk factors for falls, increasing attention to medications should become a key focus of both public health educational efforts and fall prevention in primary care practice...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect a <b>structured</b> <b>note</b> taking technique had upon student achievement and note taking skill. The students' loci of control was determined to examine if this variable had an effect upon the students' achievement after they had received one of three treatment conditions. The three treatment conditions were: no instruction in note taking; instruction and practice from a videotape presentation in the Cornell method of note taking; and the same instruction and practice plus an application component. The sample was one hundred sixty-six students who were enrolled in Reading Improvement winter quarter 1981 - 1982 at Ball State University. The students were identified as "high risk". The classes were treated as intact groups. A pretest, Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes by Brown and Holtzman, was used to ascertain that initial differences in study habits did not exist. This test {{also served as a}} posttest measure. The Internal-External Locus of Control Scale by Rotter was administered to determine the locus of control of each student. Three 3 X 2 X 2 univariate analyses of variance were performed on the three dependent measures of Work Habits, Study Habits, and Study Orientation. Due to initial sex and locus of control differences, means were found for each of the following groups: male internals, male externals, female internals, and female externals. Multivariate and univariate statistical procedures were used in analyzing the data. Upon the completion of the study, the students responded to a student evaluation form which was analyzed by Chi-Square statistical procedures. The following conclusions resulted from this study: 1. The treatment did not significantly affect the achievement of the students' note taking skill 2. Female internals obtained the highest mean scores, and male externals had the lowest mean scores on both the pretest and posttest 3. The responses on the student evaluation form were very favorable toward the Cornell methodThe Cornell method did not significantly affect the note taking skill of the students; however, the students reported a favorable impression of the technique. This reinforces the notion that high risk students are receptive to a very structured approach of instruction. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} engineering notebook is a {{pen-based computer}} tool designed to capture engineering notes and {{to assist in}} structuring them to facilitate subsequent information access. Experiments were conducted in which free-form and fixed-form note-taking interfaces were compared with respect to capturing and <b>structuring</b> <b>notes</b> from a design meeting. Suitability of domain-based and user-defined terminologies for semantic structuring was also tested. Results from the experiment confirmed that a free-form interface was easier to use for note-taking and <b>structuring</b> <b>notes</b> than were forms with fixed structure. However, difficulties with applying semantic categorizations were observed in both types of interface. The results indicated that terminology should be chosen appropriately to a task, and that experienced users have less problems with applying it.
