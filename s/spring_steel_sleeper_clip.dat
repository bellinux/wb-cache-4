5000|$|For the {{restoration}} of WHR (Caernarfon), the Ffestiniog Railway imported not only South African steam engines (some built in Manchester by Beyer Peacock and Company as recently as 1958) but also the rails and <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> on which to run them. This track included eighty completely made up panels of [...] gauge (adjusted before use to [...] gauge) straight track (for the laying of which a special rail mounted track laying gantry - 'The Forth Bridge' - was built by Winson Engineering Ltd). The greater part of the rail came with a job lot of <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers,</b> <b>clips,</b> screws, bolts and fishplates, all to several different patterns, {{which had to be}} sorted by WHR and FR volunteers before they could be used. The bulk of the track including all the curved sections was built up on site with rails moved forward to the railhead using specially built rail grab trolleys known as RRMs - [...] "Roland's Rail Movers", named after WHLR Ltd construction manager Roland Doyle. These proved to be a highly successful innovation and they have been used on all subsequent tracklaying. Amusingly, they have also acquired the nickname [...] "Roland Rats", a title believed to have originated among the track gangs at the Porthmadog end, who also use the same technology.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> {{were tried}} as an {{alternative}} to timber; Acworth writing in 1889 describes the production of <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> on the London & North Western Railway, and there is an illustration showing rolled channel section (shallow upturned [...] "U" [...] shapes) with no shaped ends, and with three-part forged chairs riveted direct. However <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> seem not to have enjoyed widespread adoption until about 1995. Their dominant usage now is for life extension of existing track on secondary routes. They have a significant advantage on weak formations and poor ballast conditions, as the bearing area is at a high level, immediately under the rail seat.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} microshot peening {{on the surface}} {{characteristics}} and fatigue life of <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> SUP 9 was investigated. In the experiment, the projective method of the microshot was of the compressed air type. The microshot of 0. 1 mm diameter was high-carbon cast steel, and the workpiece used was the commercially <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> JIS-SUP 9. The effect of the intermittent shot peening on the surface hardness was also studied. The surface layer of the workpiece was sufficiently deformed by microshot peening. The microshot peening process was very efficient in improving the fatigue life of <b>spring</b> <b>steel.</b> It {{was found that the}} use of the microshot was found to cause a significantly enhanced peening effect for <b>spring</b> <b>steel...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{line between}} Blackburn and Clitheroe was {{temporarily}} closed in November 2008 {{due to a}} major refurbishment. The £5 million scheme included 11,651 yards of continuous welded rail, 16,000 new concrete or <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> and 40,000 tonnes of ballast. Replacement bus services ran between Clitheroe and Blackburn. The line re-opened on 28 November 2008.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{technically}} innovative, {{in response to}} the terrain and conditions. The country was flat but difficult for conventional railway tracks due to flooding, lack of suitable timber for sleepers and termite attack. In 1884 Phillips patented a system for taking railways across such country which utilised special U-section <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> laid directly on the ground. During floods the line could be submerged without washing out the ballast and embankments normally used, so that it could quickly be put back into service when the waters subsided. The <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> were also impervious to termite attack, and although initially more expensive than timber sleepers, were cheaper to lay and maintain. The bridges along the line were also designed to be submersible. This system was particularly suited to the Gulf country and was specified for the Normanton to Croydon line with Phillips engaged to supervise the construction.|$|R
5000|$|The {{discovery}} of gold at Croydon in 1885, soon led to further growth in Normanton, {{as it became}} the supply base for miners. At that time the government was proposing to build a railway linking the Cloncurry copper mines and Normanton. By the end of 1886, the population at Croydon had reached 2,000, so {{the decision was made}} to divert the railway construction to Croydon utilising the materials that had been already delivered to Normanton. Tenders were called in July 1887, and the Normanton to Croydon railway line to Croydon completed in July 1891 (now known as the Gulflander). [...] The rail line featured innovative <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers,</b> designed by George Phillips. Burns Philp was the shipping agent for the <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers,</b> manufactured in Glasgow and transported to Normanton. The growth of the Croydon goldfield provided wealth for Burns Philp during the somewhat brief time it operated.|$|R

50|$|The Normanton to Croydon Railway runs 94 {{miles in}} a roughly {{south-east}} direction from Normanton to Croydon, in the Gulf country of North-west Queensland.
