40|$|Zoonotic {{diseases}} {{are a major}} cause of morbidity, and productivity losses in both human and animal populations. Identifying the source of food-borne zoonoses (e. g. an animal reservoir or food product) is crucial for the identification and prioritisation of food safety interventions. For many zoonotic diseases it is difficult to attribute human cases to sources of infection because there is little epidemiological information on the cases. However, microbial strain typing allows zoonotic pathogens to be categorised, and the relative frequencies of the strain types among the sources and in human cases allows inference on the likely source of each infection. We introduce <b>sourceR,</b> an R package for quantitative source attribution, aimed at food-borne diseases. It implements a Bayesian model using strain-typed surveillance data from both human cases and source samples, capable of identifying important sources of infection. The model measures the force of infection from each source, allowing for varying survivability, pathogenicity and virulence of pathogen strains, and varying abilities of the sources to act as vehicles of infection. A Bayesian non-parametric (Dirichlet process) approach is used to cluster pathogen strain types by epidemiological behaviour, avoiding model overfitting and allowing detection of strain types associated with potentially high "virulence". <b>sourceR</b> is demonstrated using Campylobacter jejuni isolate data collected in New Zealand between 2005 and 2008. Chicken from a particular poultry supplier was identified as the major source of campylobacteriosis, which is qualitatively similar to results of previous studies using the same dataset. Additionally, the software identifies a cluster of 9 multilocus sequence types with abnormally high 'virulence' in humans. <b>sourceR</b> enables straightforward attribution of cases of zoonotic infection to putative sources of infection. As <b>sourceR</b> develops, we intend it to become an important and flexible resource for food-borne disease attribution studies...|$|E

30|$|In the industry, {{decisions}} on apparel design and product development {{are made with}} close interactions with global sourcers. First, fiber contents (or raw material contents) not only affect {{the cost of the}} total production but also environmental impacts during the production. Let’s assume that a designer decided a fiber content to be a natural fiber, such as cotton, rather than a synthetic fiber, such as polyester, for a men’s knit shirt for the upcoming season. This simple decision could make a huge impact on retail prices. For example, in 2011, cotton prices had quadrupled since 2002 (National Cotton Council of America 2012); the cost difference between polyester and cotton fabric was so significant that the change in fiber content was not something that the design team could simply make without consulting global sourcers. Sourcers {{may not be able to}} produce products for which the company planned. Instead, the <b>sourcer</b> may suggest a cotton/polyester blend fabric for knit shirts. In addition, the change in fiber content also affects the duty rates when the global <b>sourcer</b> imports the finished products from foreign countries. In the case of the United States, men’s knit shirts with a majority of cotton fibers are subject to 19.7  % of the import cost as duty. If the same shirts are made out of synthetic fibers, they will be subject to 32  % of duty rate (Idem). These are important factors that the design team must consider and work with the sourcing team to find the optimal point between fiber choice and cost to produce and import. Different countries have different duty assessment policies and duty rates. One strategy in fiber content may work for one country but may not work for another country with different duty rates. Therefore, sourcers and design team must assess the market of the finished goods comprehensively before making final {{decisions on}} fiber choices.|$|E

40|$|AbstractResearch on {{outsourcing}} {{has been}} around for several decades. However, its application within small and medium enterprises (SMEs), namely the field of information technology outsourcing (ITO), is still a rather unexplored trail. A need of large-scale investments and unavailability of suitable applications resulted in a situation where large percentage of SMEs does not use advanced ICT services. This consequently lowers their competitiveness. Recent emergence of the Cloud Computing and related Software-as-a-Service concept may change the whole situation. However, absence of methodologies, guidelines, and tools that could help organisations with their IT strategies, outsourcing, and management of its ICT services, together with ad-hoc or unsound decisions might cause major complications in terms of quality, usability, integration, and consequently influence the total cost of the service. Use of high quality ICT services together with its appropriate management can be considered as a cornerstone of effectiveness in the next decade. This paper describes some of the specifics of the SME segment in terms of the information systems and technology. While analysing available outsourcing models in the literature it also p resents an integrated view on IT outsourcing strategies. Mainly, following the sourcing strategies taxonomy the paper describes an original concept for decision-making about outsourcing of ICT services named <b>SOURCER</b> framework.
