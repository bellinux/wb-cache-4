40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that impaired insulin/insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) input may be associated to neurodegeneration. Several major neurodegenerative diseases involve excitotoxic cell injury whereby excess glutamate signaling leads to neuronal death. Recently it was shown that glutamate inactivates Akt, a <b>serine-kinase</b> crucially involved in the prosurvival actions of IGF-I. We now report that excitotoxic doses of glutamate antagonize Akt activation by IGF-I and inhibit the neuroprotective effects of this growth factor on cultured neurons. Glutamate induces loss of sensitivity to IGF-I by phosphorylating the IGF-I receptor docking protein insulin-receptor-substrate (IRS) - 1 in Ser 307 through a pathway involving activation of PKA and PKC in a hierarchical fashion. Administration of Ro 320432, a selective PKC inhibitor, abrogates the inhibitory effects of glutamate on IGF-I-induced Akt activation in vitro and in vivo and is sufficient to block the neurotoxic action of glutamate on cultured neurons. Notably, administration of Ro 320432 after ischemic insult, a major form of excitotoxic injury in vivo, results in a marked decrease (~ 50 %) in infarct size. Therefore, uncoupling of IGF-I signaling by glutamate may constitute an additional route contributing to excitotoxic neuronal injury. Further work should determine the potential use of PKC inhibitors as a novel therapeutic strategy in ischemia and other excitotoxic insults. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|GPI-linked protein {{molecules}} become Triton-insoluble during polarized sorting to the {{apical cell}} surface of epithelial cells. These insoluble complexes, enriched in cholesterol, glycolipids, and GPI-linked proteins, have been isolated by flotation on sucrose density gradients and {{are thought to}} contain the putative GPI-sorting machinery. As the cellular origin and molecular protein components of this complex remain unknown, we have begun to characterize these low-density insoluble complexes isolated from MDCK cells. We find that these complexes, which represent 0. 4 - 0. 8 % of the plasma membrane, ultrastructurally resemble caveolae and are over 150 -fold enriched in a model GPI-anchored protein and caveolin, a caveolar marker protein. However, they exclude many other plasma membrane associated molecules and organelle-specific marker enzymes, suggesting that they represent microdomains of the plasma membrane. In addition to caveolin, these insoluble complexes contain a subset of hydrophobic plasma membrane proteins and cytoplasmically-oriented signaling molecules, including: (a) GTP- binding proteins [...] both small and heterotrimeric; (b) annex II [...] an apical calcium-regulated phospholipid binding protein with a demonstrated role in exocytic fusion events; (c) c-Yes [...] an apically localized member of the Src family of non-receptor type protein- tyrosine kinases; and (d) an unidentified <b>serine-kinase</b> activity. As we demonstrate that caveolin is both a transmembrane molecule and a major phospho-acceptor component of these complexes, we propose that caveolin could function as a transmembrane adaptor molecule that couples luminal GPI-linked proteins with cytoplasmically oriented signaling molecules during GPI-membrane trafficking or GPI-mediated signal transduction events. In addition, our results have implications for understanding v- Src transformation and the actions of cholera and pertussis toxins on hetero-trimeric G proteins...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} (H 2 O 2), a reactive oxygen species, {{is assumed}} to have a detrimental effect on neuronal plasticity. Indeed, H 2 O 2 suppresses long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices of normal rats and wild-type (wt) mice. Transgenic mice overexpressing superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 (tg-SOD), which maintain high ambient H 2 O 2, have {{also been shown to}} be impaired in their ability to express hippocampal LTP. Paradoxically, H 2 O 2, at a concentration (50 �M) that blocks LTP in wt mice, actually enhanced LTP in slices of 2 -month-old tg-SOD mice. H 2 O 2 -dependent LTP in tg-SOD was blocked by the protein phosphatase calcineurin inhibitor FK 506, but not by rapamycin, an FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP 12) inhibitor or by 1 -(5 -isoquinolinesulfonyl) - 2 -methylpiperazine (H 7), a <b>serine-kinase</b> inhibitor. Interestingly, wt and tg-SOD mice expressed similar levels of the antioxidant enzyme catalase and similar activity of glutathione peroxidase. An opposite situation was found in 2 -year-old mice. Aged wt mice were impaired in LTP in a manner that could be reversed by the addition of H 2 O 2. Surprisingly, aged tg-SOD mice exhibited larger LTP than that found in wt mice, but this was now reduced by 50 �M H 2 O 2. Both young tg-SOD and aged control mice displayed altered protein phosphatase activity, compared with that of young controls; moreover, FK 506 inhibited LTP in old tg-SOD as well as in old wt mice treated with H 2 O 2. These data promoted a dual role for H 2 O 2 in the regulation of LTP, and proposed that it is mediated by the protein phosphatase calcineurin.

40|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} protein- 2 (BMP- 2) induces {{bone formation}} and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals. BMP- 2 is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, {{as a member}} of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor <b>serine-kinases</b> in the cell membrane. The binding epitopes of BMP- 2 for BMPR-IA (type I) and BMPR-II or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using BMP- 2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope  1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP- 2 dimer. A smaller epitope  2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP- 2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C 2 C 12 cells; however, only epitope  2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP- 2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-β superfamily...|$|R
