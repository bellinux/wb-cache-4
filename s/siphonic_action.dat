2500|$|When a user flushes a toilet, a [...] "toilet flapper valve" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with a type of check valve) opens and allows water from a reservoir tank to quickly enter the toilet bowl. This rapid influx from the tank causes the swirling water in the bowl to rapidly rise and fill the U-shaped inverted siphon tube mounted {{in the back of the}} toilet. This full siphon tube starts the toilet's <b>siphonic</b> <b>action.</b> The siphon action quickly (4–7 seconds) “pulls” nearly all of the water and waste in the bowl and the on-rushing tank water down the drain—it flushes. When most of the water has drained out of the bowl, the continuous column of water up and over the bottom of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe (the siphon) is broken when air enters the siphon tube. The toilet then gives its characteristic gurgle as the <b>siphonic</b> <b>action</b> ceases and no more water flows out of the toilet. After flushing, the flapper valve in the water tank closes; water lines and valves connected to the water supply refill the toilet tank and bowl. Then the toilet is again ready for use.|$|E
2500|$|The {{siphoning}} toilet {{is perhaps}} the most popular design in North America for residential and light commercial toilet installations. Some other terms for these types of toilets are [...] "siphon jet", [...] "siphon wash", and in North America, [...] "wash down". All siphoning toilets incorporate an [...] "S" [...] shaped waterway. The waterways in these toilets are designed with slightly smaller diameters than a non-siphoning toilet, so that the waterway will naturally fill up with water, each time it is flushed, thus creating the siphon action. To flush the toilet the user activates a flushing mechanism (see above), which pours a large quantity of water quickly into the bowl. This creates a flow large enough to purge the bowl's waterway of all air, thus causing the bowl to empty rapidly due to the siphon action that has been created. This flow stops as soon as the water level in the bowl drops below the first bend of the siphon, allowing air to enter the S-pipe to break the column of liquid and to halt the <b>siphonic</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
50|$|Flushing troughs are {{commonly}} used {{in places such as}} schools, colleges, public toilets, factories and public buildings where quick refill of the flushing cistern is required. <b>Siphonic</b> <b>action</b> is started {{in the same way as}} an ordinary flushing cistern. As the water is siphoned, the water level falls only inside a timing box designed to permit the required flush. When the timing box has been emptied of water, air enters through an air pipe to break the <b>siphonic</b> <b>action.</b> The timing box refills with water through a hole in its side. The cistern is then ready to flush.|$|E

40|$|Siphonic roof {{drainage}} {{systems have been}} in existence for more than 40 years and are becoming an increasingly common element of urban drainage infrastructure. A siphonic system allows roof runoff to quickly reach its maximum flowrate. In contrast to a conventional system the siphonic approach to roof drainage aims to exclude air and to induce the full bore flow conditions required for <b>siphonic</b> <b>action.</b> This means that the filling and priming times are more efficient and quicker than for a conventional gravity-fed roof drainage system. Understanding the priming time of siphonic systems can help to identify potential problems in large systems {{that may not be}} able to fill and prime quickly enough to deal with high-intensity storms of short duration. The results from the work presented in this thesis will hopefully improve our understanding of the priming process in a siphonic roof drainage system and assist the water industry to move towards the use of unsteady flow models for design and performance modelling. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to examine {{negative}} pressures in siphonic downpipes and to see whether these can be controlled through breaking the <b>siphonic</b> <b>action</b> by injecting air at certain points in a vertical downpipe. The study also investigated cavitation and its propagation through a prototype scale siphonic system. The paper presents methods for limiting the minimum pressure in siphonic downpipes in tall buildings. A distinctive drop in pressure between approximately — 70 kN/m 2 and — 96 kN/m 2 occurred in a 80 mm diameter downpipe and it was not possible to sustain pressures between these limits. The pressure drop to - 96 kN/m 2 caused the formation of a distinctive cavitation zone. Any increase in downpipe length, beyond the cavitation zone, produced a proportional increase in the cavitation zone length. Practical application: Cavitation is perceived to be a serious problem for designers of siphonic drainage systems to be installed in tall buildings. Using full-scale testing this paper provides evidence that in practice cavitation in plastic downpipes is unlikely to cause damage. The paper also provides guidelines for maximum spacing of air inlets to limit the minimum pressure to ∼ 70 kN/m 2 below atmospheric pressure without significantly decreasing the system capacity...|$|E
40|$|Siphonic roof {{drainage}} systems (SRDS ’ s) have been widespread used now for approximately 40 years and are an efficient method of removing rainwater rapidly from roofs. SRDS ’ s {{are designed to}} run full-bore, resulting in sub-atmospheric system pressures with high hydraulic driving heads and higher system flow velocities than conventionally guttered systems. Hence, SRDS ’ s normally require far fewer downpipes, and the depressurised conditions also mean {{that much of the}} collection pipework can be routed at a high level, thus reducing the extent of any underground pipework. But, they work properly at only one roof run-off rate and therefore suffer from sizing and operational problems including noise and vibration which limit their performance and adoption rate. Climate change is creating situations where normal ranges of rainfall intensity are being frequently exceeded, so the typical:storm ratios (r TS) are large increasing. Current SRDS ’ s typically operate within a small r TS range of 2. This may {{have an impact on the}} future uptake of SRDS ’ s. This paper describes the development of a novel SRDS which includes a small mobile cap at the roof of outlet appears to offer benefits and avoids sizing problems associated with current SRDS ’ s. The cap has the potential to avoid noise associated with making and breaking <b>siphonic</b> <b>action</b> through flow modulation. Laboratory scale tests demonstrate the basic feasibility of the cap system and indicate that the cap functions reliably. This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. Basic on sizing and design optimiza - tion factors are suggested. The r TS range is increased from approximately 2 to approximately 6. </p...|$|E
