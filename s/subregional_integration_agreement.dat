40|$|This article {{uses the}} CEFTA {{experience}} to explore interactions between <b>subregional</b> <b>integration</b> and the EU pre-accession process. It covers the following issues. What contributions did CEFTA {{make to the}} EU membership endeavour? In which ways did the EU membership drive impact on the subregional cooperation process? Were restrictions on the form of integration applied (basic trade liberalisation in the CEFTA case) a conscious choice or are there inbuilt limits to <b>subregional</b> <b>integration</b> pursued in the EU pre-accession context? What factors influenced the institutionalisation and widening issues? Does the CEFTA experience offer any lessons for other <b>subregional</b> <b>integration</b> exercises, including those already underway - as in the West Balkans - or purportedly on the agenda - as in the 'United Economic Space' planned by certain former Soviet states? The discussion is organised as follows: introduction/preliminaries; the origins of CEFTA; the evolution of CEFTA cooperation; outcomes of CEFTA cooperation; the future of CEFTA. (Informaworld...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{investment}} effects of regional <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> and discusses how such arrangements may affect inward and {{outward foreign direct investment}} (FDI) flows in the integrating region. After setting up a conceptual framework for the analysis, we provide three studies focusing on different kinds of regional integration: North-North integration (Canada joining CUSFTA), North-South integration (Mexico’s accession to NAFTA), and South-South integration (MERCOSUR). The main conclusion of the study is that the responses to an <b>integration</b> <b>agreement</b> largely depend on the environmental change brought about by the agreement and the locational advantages of the participating countries and industries. Moreover, the findings suggest that the most positive impact on FDI has occurred when regional <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> have coincided with domestic liberalization and macroeconomic stabilization in the member countries.

Rather than being spurred by exogenous forces alone, the two phenomena are likely to an extent both path-dependent and endogenous to one another.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe a new, extensive dataset on international agreements that can be employed to start mending the gaps in the literature, and to develop a research agenda on the best practices of sequencing international agreements so as to obtain higher pay-offs from cooperation. Of particular interest here is the relationship between trade <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> and other cooperation agreements; the data provide preliminary grounds for hypothesizing that trade <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> can be a particularly likely catalyst for further cooperation between states...|$|R
40|$|Since 2012 {{migrants}} arriving {{regularly in}} Italy must sign an <b>integration</b> <b>agreement</b> and declare their agreement with a ‘Charter of the values’.

While the point-based system discriminates against the poor, the less educated and qualified, the subordinate workers, and the nomads, the Charter {{is inspired by}} stereotypical and stigmatizing visions of Islam. This paper identifies the cases of discrimination, both legal (freedom of thought, presumption of innocence, principle of non-discrimination, right to an effective remedy, laicism of state) and symbolical, of the <b>integration</b> <b>agreement,</b> and analyses Italian integration measures before {{the background of the}} concept of differential inclusion: the incorporation of regular migrants requires them to pass under a symbolic and legal yoke, which increases their hierarchical differentiation.

40|$|Using a panel dataset of {{bilateral}} flows of banking sector {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) in developed and developing countries, we study the impact of regional <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> (RIAs) on the location of banking sector FDI. The {{results indicate that the}} impact of RIAs vary depending on different kinds of regional integration. The response to integration between developed countries (North-North integration) may differ from the response to integration between developing countries (South-South integration) or to an agreement between countries at different levels of development (North-South integration), depending on the significance and nature of environmental change brought about by the RIAs, the locational advantage of the country or region and the degree of integration at the outset. The RIAs between developed countries had relatively little influence on foreign bank entry, since much of the financial service trade between the member countries had been liberalized long before the agreement was established. By contrast, North-South <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> and South-South <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> brought about significant region’s policy environment changes and more proximity institutional, which suggests that they may have a notable (although varying) impact on banking sector FDI in the member countries...|$|R
40|$|Since {{information}} technologies (IT) {{such as the}} 2 ̆ 2 Internet 2 ̆ 2 are being heralded as vehicles for increasing economic integration, {{the focus of this}} study is to determine ways that Internet technology can be used to increase West African subregional trade. The research design used both the survey and case methods to determine (1) perceptions of how the four independent variables (political, economic, social and technical) influence Internet adoption, and (2) whether Internet adoption has an influence on subregional trade in West Africa. The multilingual questionnaire (English, French and Portuguese) was based on an extensive review of literature and exploratory information taken from Internet discussion groups. The respondent sample frame was taken from embassy trade lists, commercial trade directories, and convenience samples of Internet discussion groups focusing on technological development in Africa. Questionnaires from seven countries were received. Case analysis consisted of a series of structured interviews which took place at a technology conference in Accra, Ghana. These interviews were conducted to supplement the survey response rate. After the data were tested for both reliability (alpha coefficient) and validity (factor analysis), five hypotheses were tested. The study found that (1) out of the four independent variables chosen for the study, only the political variable had a profound influence on Internet adoption and (2) Internet adoption is strongly correlated with subregional trade. Conclusions drawn from this study suggest that, despite the lack of ability to regulate the Internet, the government plays an important role in producing the a hospitable climate for its development. While cost is still a concern for most trade companies, awareness of the Internet is widespread and 2 ̆ 2 technophobia 2 ̆ 2 has been surmounted. Alternative power sources are needed to sustain growth and collaborative efforts are encouraged for <b>subregional</b> <b>integration.</b> Some recommendations are: formation of Internet advocacy groups to influence government technological initiatives; collaboration between subregional organs such as Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), West African Monetary Agency (WAMA) and West African Enterprise Network (WAEN); proliferation of subregional 2 ̆ 2 telecenters 2 ̆ 2; 2 ̆ 2 West African Internetwork 2 ̆ 2 topology using Internet and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to promote <b>subregional</b> <b>integration...</b>|$|R

The results show that although economic and geographical factors are the most important explanatory factors for the probability of regional <b>integration</b> <b>agreement</b> formation or enhancement, socio-political variables also contribute to explain the formation of regional <b>integration</b> <b>agreements.</b> Democracies and countries with a higher level of economic freedom are more likely to form or enhance RIAs.

The research has two main aims: first, to empirically analyse the determinants of different levels of integration, re-examining the evidence presented by Baier and Bergstrand (2004) in the JIE 64 (1); and second, to analyse the importance of additional factors, in particular socio-political factors. The results show that geographical factors alone {{are the most important}} explanatory factors for the probability of regional <b>integration</b> <b>agreement</b> formation or enhancement, thus supporting the theories on "natural" trading partners. The socio-political factors considered, democracy dummy, the level of economic freedom and the common language dummy are all statistically significant, although their relative importance in explaining RIA formation is low. ...|$|R

40|$|We ask how two {{reforms of}} {{migration}} law (EEA accession in 1994 and the <b>integration</b> <b>agreement</b> regulation in 2003) impacted on the education structure of migrants to Austria. To identify {{the effects of}} these reforms, we use the fact that EEA accession affected only migrants from EEA countries, while third country citizens were unaffected and that the opposite is the case for the <b>integration</b> <b>agreement</b> regulation. We find robust evidence that the share of low educated permanent migrants from the EEA to Austria reduced relative to the share of low educated permanent migrants from other countries due to Austria's EEA accession. With respect to the reform of residence law in 2003 our results are less robust. Most of them, however, point to an increased share of low skilled permanent migrants...|$|R
