2500|$|The chief {{competitor}} of {{both these}} couplers, more popular among serious modellers, was the Magne-Matic, a magnetically released knuckle coupler developed by Keith and Dale Edwards, and manufactured by Kadee, a company they started.

A steel pin, designed to resemble an air brake hose, allows the couplers to be released magnetically; the design of the coupler head prevents this from happening unless the train is stopped or reversed with a mated pair of couplers directly over an uncoupling magnet. An earlier, mechanically tripped version of the design had a <b>straight</b> <b>pin</b> extending down from the knuckle itself, which engaged a diamond-shaped mechanical [...] "ramp" [...] between the rails, which had to be raised above rail height when uncoupling was desired.|$|E
2500|$|Still, the Dorians did {{share in}} the Geometric period and {{therefore}} to find its origin might be perhaps to find {{the origin of the}} Dorians. The Geometric originated by clear transition from the Proto-geometric. The logical break in material culture is the start of the Proto-geometric at about 1050 BC, which leaves a gap of 150 years. The year 1050 offers nothing distinctively Dorian either, but if the Dorians were present in the Geometric, and they were not always in place as an unrecorded lower class, 1050 is most likely time of entry. Cartledge says humorously:"It has of late become an acknowledged scandal that the Dorians, archaeologically speaking, do not exist.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{procedure for}} displaced fracture of the surgical {{neck of the}} humerus uses <b>straight</b> <b>pins</b> inserted from the lateral aspect towards {{the head of the}} humerus. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the mechanical properties of fixation by contoured (curved) pins to those fixed with regular <b>straight</b> <b>pins.</b> A transverse osteotomy was made in 30 fresh-frozen sheep humeri in the proximal metaphyseal bone region, and pins were inserted using either three parallel <b>straight</b> <b>pins</b> or three contoured pins in different planes. The assemblies were subjected to bending or rotational stresses at the fracture site. Loads versus deformations were acquired during loading and rigidity was calculated. Results showed that in bending, fixation with <b>straight</b> <b>pins</b> was 31 % more rigid compared to contoured pins (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), and in torsion, fixation using contoured pins was 21 % more rigid compared to <b>straight</b> <b>pins</b> (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). A combination of the two fixation types should be considered...|$|R

50|$|Some hairpins are {{a single}} <b>straight</b> <b>pin,</b> but modern {{versions}} {{are more likely}} to be constructed from different lengths of wire that are bent in half with a u-shaped end and a few kinks along the two opposite portions.

The kinks enable retaining the pin during normal movements.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{most modern}} brooches, fibulae {{were not only}} decorative; they {{originally}} served a practical function: to fasten clothing, such as cloaks.

In turn, fibulae were replaced as clothing fasteners by buttons in the Middle Ages. Their descendant, the modern safety pin, remains in use today. In ancient Rome and other places where Latin was used, the same word denoted both a brooch and the fibula bone because a popular form for brooches and the shape of the bone were thought to resemble one another.|$|R

Sometimes 'found' focal points are used for necklaces, such as rings or gemstones, either wire-wrapped to allow for securing or captured in a net-like array of intertwining overhand knots.

Scissors, <b>straight</b> <b>pins,</b> and thimbles found at the site suggest that women sewed for both work and for their families. The excavations uncovered stoneware and earthenware that scholars believe to have been used to prepare food; enslaved men and women at Poplar Forest ate fruits and vegetables as well as beef, pork, venison, opossum, rabbit, chicken, turkey, and fish, and possibly had access to firearms with which to hunt animals.|$|R
50|$|The {{common theme}} among all Amish {{clothing}} is plainness; clothing should not {{call attention to}} the wearer by cut, color, or any other feature. Hook-and-eye closures or <b>straight</b> <b>pins</b> are used as fasteners on dress clothing rather than buttons, zippers, or velcro. Snaps are used on everyday clothes, and plain buttons for work shirts and trousers. The historic restriction on buttons is attributed to tradition and their potential for ostentation. In all things, the aesthetic value is plainness. Some groups tend to limit color to black (trousers, dresses) and white (shirts), while others allow muted colors. Dark blue denim work clothing is common within some groups as well. The Old Order Amish often sew their own clothing, and work clothing can become quite worn and patched with use.|$|R

Large sections of the wooden hull were intact, protected from the damaging effects of warm salt water by layers of muddy sediment which [...] "essentially creat an oxygen-free time capsule". La Belle was the oldest French shipwreck discovered in the Western Hemisphere to that date.

The cofferdam held back the waters of the bay, allowing archaeologists to conduct the excavation as if it were on land. This was the first attempt in North America to excavate a shipwreck in dry conditions. Previous shipwreck excavations using cofferdams were completed in Europe, but never on a ship as large as the Belle.|$|R
