5|$|Writing systems {{represent}} language using visual symbols, {{which may}} or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single <b>sounds,</b> <b>so</b> that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign represents an entire word, and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.|$|E

25|$|Regardless, modern Brazilian Portuguese {{was highly}} {{influenced}} by other languages introduced by immigrants through the past century, specifically by German, Italian and Japanese immigrants. This high intake of immigrants not only caused the incorporation and/or adaptation of many words and expressions from {{their native language}} into local language but also created specific dialects {{as it is the}} case of German's Hunsrückisch dialect in the South of Brazil. This {{is also one of the}} main reasons why Brazilian Portuguese <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> different from other Portuguese derivatives.|$|E

25|$|To {{compose the}} music, Sakoda used real instruments, then notated {{the music on}} an MSX {{computer}} and converted it onto a PC-9800. Since he didn't like mechanical sounds, he programmed the virtual instruments to sound like they were played by humans. Sakoda worked closely with sound effects programmer Masanobu Tsukamoto. Since the game had limited sound channels, he exercised caution not to create too many simultaneous <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> the sound effects would not cut out the music. Sakoda only had four channels to use in any given song, {{one of which was}} always fixexd on drums. After the soundtrack was nearly finished. Compile leadership told Sakoda to change the music to something which fit the Japanese aesthetic. After hearing a new soundtrack with plucky Japanese instruments, leadership told Sakoda to revert back to his original music.|$|E
25|$|Suppose a {{listener}} cannot hear a given acoustical signal under silent condition. When a signal is playing while another sound {{is being played}} (a masker) the signal has to be stronger for the listener to hear it. The masker {{does not need to}} have the frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A masked signal can be heard even though it is weaker than the masker. Masking happens when a signal and a masker are played together. It also happens when a masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The masking effect has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking you can change the levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The masking effect is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker <b>sounds,</b> <b>so</b> the listener can not hear the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.|$|E

500|$|Originally, [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] {{was planned}} to be {{released}} as the third single from The Fame Monster, as a preference of Gaga's record label.

500|$|After the {{introduction}} of Sensurround, movie theater owners began installing permanent subwoofer systems. Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track was a six channel film sound format introduced in 1976 that used two subwoofer channels for stereo reproduction of low frequencies. In 1981, Altec introduced a dedicated cinema subwoofer model tuned to around 20Hz: the 8182. Starting in 1983, THX certification of the cinema sound experience quantified the parameters of good audio for watching films, including requirements for subwoofer performance levels and enough isolation from outside <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> that noise did {{not interfere with the}} listening experience. This helped provide guidelines for multiplex cinema owners who wanted to isolate each individual cinema from its neighbors, even as louder subwoofers were making isolation more difficult. Specific cinema subwoofer models appeared from JBL, Electro-Voice, Eastern Acoustic Works, Kintek, Meyer Sound Laboratories and BGW Systems in the early 1990s. In 1992, Dolby Digital's six-channel film sound format incorporated a single LFE channel, the [...] "point one" [...] in 5.1 surround sound.|$|E

500|$|More recently, AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger {{has written}} of Yellow Submarine: [...] "The album {{would have been}} far better value if it had been {{released}} as a four-song EP... {{with the addition of a}} bonus track in [...] "Across the Universe"... No one would argue that there's a huge amount more than meets the eye (or ear) there, but listening to the original album anew 40 years on, one is still struck by how mostly second-rate, and recycled and rejected Beatles material still <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> good." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Mark Richardson opines that [...] "the Yellow Submarine soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn't really be bothered" [...] and describes [...] "Hey Bulldog" [...] as [...] "a tough and funky piano-driven rocker, [...] by a good margin the best song here". Richardson concludes: [...] "But as an album it's ultimately forgettable, which is something the Beatles so rarely were otherwise." ...|$|E
500|$|On Slant Magazines [...] "Best of the Aughts" [...] list, {{the album}} was placed at numbersix out of one-hundred. Reflecting on the album's reception, Chater felt it was well {{received}} because [...] "It's light-hearted and fun to listen to and there is depth there as well. There are some sadder moments that I think has made it resonate and made it last. It does sound like a 23 year old kid in his bedroom making a record to me, but you can hear that innocence and joy in the discovery of finding all those <b>sounds.</b> <b>So</b> {{that was kind of}} infectious for people." [...] In October 2010, it was listed at No.10 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. Philip Sherburne, writing for Rhapsody, said that [...] "along with DJ Shadow's Endtroducing, this is one of plunderphonic music's greatest LPs." [...] The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} an aggregate score of 86/100 at Metacritic, based on 12 reviews, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". Kerrang! editor James Mcmahon gave the album {{five out of}} five [...] "K"s, classing The Blackest Beautiful as a [...] "classic", praising the inclusion of producers Kit Walters and Stephen George. He wrote: [...] "What The Blackest Beautiful certainly is, though, {{is the sound of}} letlive. right here and right now. And right now, letlive. sound amazing. Get Down." [...] Metal Hammer writer Stephen Hill gave the album a nine out of ten, saying [...] "it's hard to pick out highlights when every track <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> fresh, joyous and casually rule-book torching" [...] and that [...] "this is the kind of album that changes people's lives". Chris Hidden of Rock Sound also gave a nine out of ten, calling it a [...] "bold record" [...] and highlighting its fusion of [...] "staggering dynamics, brain-burrowing melodies and intelligent production".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{appraisal}} of Pacer has been mixed. Allmusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes the album as [...] "exciting, gut-level rock & roll". The Rough Guide to Rock calls Pacer [...] "satisfyingly lo-fi". In Spin magazine, reviewer Joy Press {{writes that the}} album includes [...] "a half-dozen gems" [...] but that its overall [...] "foggy sound" [...] and [...] "indecipherable lyrics" [...] prevent the listener from fully embracing the work. Robert Christgau considers the album's songs to be [...] "definitely slight" [...] and [...] "uneven" [...] but praises the vocals, stating that [...] "speedy or dreamy, Kim Deal <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> sane, so unpretentious, so goddamn nice {{that you want to}} take her home and give her a shampoo". In The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock, critic Ira Robbins writes that [...] "Other than the fine title track and a few others, the performances are forced and lackluster; the production varies between flat and colorless." [...] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide similarly praises the title song while dismissing the rest of the album as [...] "forgettable".|$|E
500|$|The {{internal}} {{structures of}} the crest of Corythosaurus are quite complex, making possible a call {{that could be used}} for warning or attracting a mate. Nasal passageways of Corythosaurus, as well as Hypacrosaurus and Lambeosaurus are S-shaped, with Parasaurolophus only possessing U-shaped tubes. Any vocalization would travel through these elaborate chambers, and probably get amplified. Scientists speculate that Corythosaurus could make loud, low pitched cries [...] "like a wind or brass instrument", such as a trombone. The sounds could serve to alert other Corythosaurus to the presence of food or a potential threat from a predator. The nasal passages emit low-frequency sounds when Corythosaurus exhaled. The individual crests would produce different <b>sounds,</b> <b>so</b> it is likely that each species of lambeosaurine would have had a unique sound. However, even though the range for different lambeosaurine nasal passages vary, they all probable made low-pitched sounds. This might be because low sounds (below 400 Hz) travel a set distance in any environment, while higher (above 400 Hz) sounds have a larger spread in the distance travelled.|$|E
500|$|When Maxinquaye {{was first}} released, it {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. In a review for Mojo, Jon Savage {{called it a}} very ambitious and musically audacious work that brilliantly explored the disparities in Britain's social structure, with Topley-Bird as the [...] "dominant voice" [...] articulating Tricky's vision of uncertainty in an ever-changing world. Dele Fadele from NME said the record was unprecedented, spellbinding, and revealed something new with every listen. He found Tricky's production innovative and his fusion of various <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> seamless, [...] "you can't label the results under any existing genre". David Bennun of Melody Maker deemed the album almost perfect and Tricky's music highly [...] "gripping, original, sublime, his lyrics so abstruse and woven into the sound, that they become inseparable". Maxinquayes combination of [...] "dreamlike ambient music and hip-hop bite" [...] was praised by Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn for giving Tricky's [...] "soundscapes about contemporary life such a seductive and provocative edge". In Q, Tom Doyle credited Topley-Bird's singing for making Maxinquaye [...] "a highly inventive and intoxicating collection" [...] while declaring that [...] "with this debut, Tricky proves himself to be more challenging and eclectic than his peers".|$|E
