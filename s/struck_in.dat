5|$|According to Newman and Bressett, {{the manner}} in which the 1804 dollars were {{produced}} is proof that none were <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> 1804. They note that the Castaing machine's edging dies utilized an 'H' that was undersized in relation to the other letters, the same as those used on Draped Bust dollars throughout the regular production of those coins. However, the edge lettering on all Class I 1804 dollars is deformed and partially obliterated, meaning that they were not <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> an open-collared coinage press as was used in 1804, but one which used a steel collar that was not introduced to the Mint until 1833. The deformation of the edge lettering was caused by pressure pushing the coinage metal against the steel collar containing the coin blank. Additionally, many 1804 dollars were <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> proof finish, a technique which was first employed at the Mint in 1817.|$|E

5|$|In January 1938, the Mint {{announced}} an open competition {{for a new}} nickel design, to feature early president Thomas Jefferson on the obverse, and Jefferson's home, Monticello on the reverse.

5|$|In her Navy career, Mercy made four transatlantic round {{trips to}} France, {{bringing}} home almost 2,000 wounded men.

5|$|Special coins {{for sale}} to {{collectors}} were <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> proof finish through {{the run of the}} Susan B. Anthony dollar, and some minting variations are valuable to collectors. However, most circulation strikes remained in government stockpiles for several years after minting, so many of the coins are available in uncirculated grades, and the premium over face value is minimal.|$|E
5|$|The Gobrecht dollar, minted from 1836 to 1839, was {{the first}} silver dollar struck for {{circulation}} by the United States Mint since production of that denomination was officially halted in 1806.

5|$|The Indian Head cent was <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> large {{quantities}} and most dates remain inexpensive: Yeoman lists all dates from 1900 to 1908 from Philadelphia at $2 in Good-4 condition.

5|$|The first {{shooting}} thaler {{was issued}} for the Chur shooting festival in 1842 and is denominated at four francs. The second, issued for Glarus, has a face value of forty batzen. The third, minted for the shooting festival in Geneva, is denominated at ten francs. A total of eighteen designs were <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> the nineteenth century, concluding with the Bern issue of 1885. All those struck from 1855 to 1885 bear the denomination of five francs. Many nineteenth-century issues were also <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> various other metals besides silver, including gold and white metal, in small quantities. In 1934, {{a new series}} began production. This series, however, was cut short due to the outbreak of World War II. Another series of shooting thalers began mintage in 1984. The first coins issued in this new series were those minted for the festival at Oberhasli. Every year since has seen the mintage of two coins, each bearing the same design, one <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> silver, the other in gold. The only exceptions are the issues of Zürich and Sion in 1999, {{one of which was}} <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> copper–nickel, two in silver and two in gold. Until 1995, silver issues were denominated at fifty francs, while gold pieces were denominated at 1,000 francs. Later, gold issues were denominated at 500 francs, excepting only the Zürich issues of 1999.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its path, Hurricane Flora {{resulted}} in more than 7,000 deaths and over $525million in damage (1963USD, $ USD). It is estimated that, if a hurricane like Flora had <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> 1998, it would have caused over 12,000 casualties.|$|E
5|$|With {{the designs}} accepted, the Mint created working dies {{based on the}} plaster model in July 1925.

5|$|After {{attending}} a theatre show on March 18, Morgan Earp was assassinated by gunmen firing {{from a dark}} alley through a door window into a room where he was playing billiards. Morgan was <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> the right side. The bullet shattered his spine, passed through his left side, and lodged in the thigh of George A. B. Berry. Another round narrowly missed Wyatt. A doctor was summoned and Morgan was moved from the floor to a nearby couch. The assassins escaped {{in the dark and}} Morgan died 40 minutes later.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E
5|$|Another {{earthquake}} <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> 1202, and it {{may have}} been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace of it has been discovered.|$|E
