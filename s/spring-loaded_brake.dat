40|$|Conventional spring actuated, {{hydraulically}} released, fail-safe disk {{braking system}} {{is modified to}} control the angular deceleration of a massive antenna. The hydraulic system provides an immediate preset pressure to the <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>brake</b> shoes and holds it at this value to decelerate the antenna at the desired rate...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{fail-safe}} systems is the overflow tube in baths and kitchen sinks. If the valve sticks open, rather than causing an overflow and damage, the tank spills into an overflow. Another common example is that in an elevator the cable supporting the car keeps <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>brakes</b> open. If the cable breaks, the brakes grab rails, and the elevator cabin does not fall.|$|R
50|$|The truck has {{drum brakes}} on all wheels. The air brake system is {{hydraulically}} actuated, allowing for soft braking even when cold. A proportioning load device adjusts rear brake force to different loads. In addition, the 1017 has a <b>spring-loaded</b> parking <b>brake</b> {{on the rear}} wheels and a wear-free pneumatic engine brake.|$|R
