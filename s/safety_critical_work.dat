40|$|Many complex {{work environments}} {{rely heavily on}} {{cognitive}} operators using rules. Operators sometimes fail to implement rules, with catastrophic human, social and economic costs. Rule-based error is widely reported, yet the mechanisms of rule vulnerability have received less attention. This paper examines rule vulnerability in the complex setting of airline transport operations. We examined ‘the stable approach criteria rule’, which acts as a system defence during the approach to land. The study experimentally tested whether system state complexity influenced rule failure. The results showed increased uncertainty and dynamism led to increased likelihood of rule failure. There was also an interaction effect, indicating complexity from different sources can combine to further constrain rule-based response. We discuss the results in relation to recent aircraft accidents and suggest that ‘rule-based error’ could be progressed to embrace rule vulnerability, fragility and failure. This better reflects the influence that system behaviour and cognitive variety have on rule-based response. Practitioner Summary: In this study, we examined mechanisms of rule vulnerability in the complex setting of airline transport operations. The results suggest work scenarios featuring high uncertainty and dynamism constrain rule-based response, leading to rules becoming vulnerable, fragile or failing completely. This has significant implications for rule-intensive, <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> <b>work</b> environments...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report how a small, family-owned children's play centre can achieve {{competitive}} advantage by developing a differentiated service. The aim is to show how this differentiation strategy is operationalized in a small family business using <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> and <b>work</b> <b>critical</b> regulatory practices, and to examine their impact on operations and customers. Design/methodology/approach – A case study approach was taken, collecting data through observation over a 24 -month period from design, through construction, to the first 18 months of operations. A survey of customers was undertaken after the centre had been open for 12 months. Findings – From startup in 2005, the centre has attracted between 1, 500 and 2, 000 children per week. It charges premium admission prices (twice those of competitors) and also charges for accompanying adults. Customers travel up to 20 miles to the centre, extremely high customer satisfaction levels are achieved, over 99 per cent of customers would recommend the centre to others and repeat visits are the norm. Research limitations/implications – The research covers a single case and therefore is only generalisable back to theory rather than to the population of free-standing children's soft play area businesses. Practical implications – When organizations within a particular industry sector operate within the confines of that industry's legal requirements, it is the voluntary practices that are likely to lead to differentiation of the service. Originality/value – The paper provides a detailed case study on how a small family business achieves competitive advantage by utilising <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> and <b>work</b> <b>critical</b> practices to strategically differentiate its service offering...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to assess information behaviour as it pertains to operational teams in dynamic safety critical operations. Method. In this paper, I describe some of the problems faced by crews on modern flight decks and suggest a framework modelled on Information Science, Human Factors, and Activity Theory research to assess the distribution of information actions, namely information identification, gathering and use, by teams of users in a dynamic, safety critical environment. Analysis. By analysing the information behaviour of crews who have accidents and those who do not, researchers may be able to ascertain how they (fail to) make use of essential, safety critical information in their information environment. The ultimate goal {{of this research is}} to differentiate information behaviour among the distinct outcomes. Results. This research affords the possibility to discern differences in distributed information behaviour illustrating that crews who err to the point of an accident appear to practice different distributed information behaviour than those who do not. This foundation serves to operationalise team sense-making through illustrating the social practice of information structuring within the activity of the work environment. Conclusion.. The distributed information behaviour framework provides a useful structure to study the patterning and organization of information distributed over space and time, to reach a common goal. This framework may allow researchers and investigators alike to identify critical information activity in the negotiation of meaning in high reliability <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> <b>work,</b> eventually informing safer practice.

40|$|Shore based monitoring, communication, {{coordination}} {{and management of}} vessel traffic in ports worldwide is a real world problem. Informed by ethnomethodological studies of work, this thesis explores the ordered in situ work of Vessel Traffic Service Operators (VTSOs); the coordination of vessel traffic; the fine grained artful performance and achievement of safe fairway navigation and the challenges faced by the VTS operators in the daily accomplishment of their institutional role. An important source of data in this ethnographic study is the naturally occurring interaction on the main working Very High Frequency (VHF) radio channel of the port, which helps explore institutional talk at work deployed to facilitate interaction, negotiation and the accomplishment of safe navigation. Three additional research techniques are utilised for data generation – observations, semi structured interviews and unstructured interviews. The case of a major Indian world port is utilised to explore the daily work of marine traffic {{coordination and}} the (pro) active interactional accomplishment of channel navigation. Research takes place against the dynamic backdrop of the harbour – a complex space with a myriad of social actors populating the scene – the VTS operators atop their tower; shipboard seafarers negotiating restricted waters; pilots rendering pilotage services; Dock Master commanding the station; seafarers aboard small local craft and lively fishermen who at times pepper the marine radio with colourful language. Two categories of findings emerge – port interaction order, institutional talk and the contingent practices that accomplish the safety/time <b>critical</b> <b>work</b> and the technological, organisational and social constraints that shape, affect and inform {{the work of the}} VTS operators. This study fills a gap in ethnomethodological studies of work with its focus on the VTS work site – a centre of coordination; it explores social order and contributes {{to the understanding of the}} local practical achievement of traffic coordination and channel navigation in restricted waters. It also contributes to our understanding of the constraints faced by the workers in the <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> VTS <b>work</b> setting. Also discussed are the status of VTS operators and occupational hierarchy in the world port.

These topics have begun to stimulate research and development in the wide control community particularly for these installations that need a high degree of tolerance with respect to possible fault. Note that this topic repre-sents a key point mainly for offshore wind turbines with very large rotors, since they are characterized by challenging modeling and control problems, as well as expensive and <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> maintenance <b>works.</b> In this case, a clear con-flict exists between ensuring a high degree of availability and reducing maintenance times, which affect the final ener-gy cost.

Fault tolerant control methods can provide a sustainable optimization of the energy conversion efficiency over wider than normally expected working conditions. This special issue is devoted to any kind of fault detection and isolation (FDI) and fault tolerant control methods ap-plied to WT systems.

Several research groups world wide have engaged with the development of low-power wireless body sensor networks that are capable of providing real-time posture tracking for a variety of applications, such as dance and sports. The work reported here is concerned with the development of a wireless body sensor network that, as opposed to posture tracking, can: a) provide the identification and classification of eight human postures (standing, kneeling, sitting, crawling, walking, laying down on front and back, and laying on one side) in real-time and b) is able to relate this information wirelessly to a remote monitoring point.

40|$|The {{motivation}} for this paper {{comes from a}} real {{need to have an}} overview about the challenges of modelling and control for very demanding systems, such as wind turbine systems, which require reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety over power conversion efficiency. These issues have begun to stimulate research and development in the wide control community particularly for these installations that need a high degree of “sustainability”. Note that this represents a key point for offshore wind turbines, since they are characterised by expensive and/or <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> maintenance <b>work.</b> In this case, a clear conflict exists between ensuring a high degree of availability and reducing maintenance times, which affect the final energy cost.

Suitable control methods can provide a sustainable optimisation of the energy conversion efficiency over wider than normally expected working conditions. Moreover, a proper mathematical description of the wind turbine system should be able to capture the complete behaviour of the process under monitoring, thus providing an important impact on the control design itself. In this way, the control scheme could guarantee prescribed performance, whilst also giving a degree of “tolerance” to possible deviation of characteristic properties or system parameters from standard conditions, if properly included in the wind turbine model itself. The most important developments in advanced controllers for wind turbines are also revised, and open problems in the areas of modelling of wind turbines are also outlined...|$|R

For read-only queries the perceived wisdom has been that support for fault-tolerance is too expensive to be worthwhile. Distributed query processing is coming {{to be seen as a}} promising way of implementing applications that combine structured data and analysis operations in dynamic distributed settings such as computational grids.
