30|$|Third Step. During {{the process}} of the MediCal application, Mrs. P’s cancer stage changed to Stage IV. Financial navigators {{immediately}} forwarded the new medical information to a local MediCal eligibility analyst for the purpose of establishing presumptive State MediCal Status (if approved, the patient would now be able to attend medical appointments to out-of-county medical providers as referred by the local oncologist). Because the patient was considered terminal, the patient was given presumptive State MediCal by the County. Since it is Presumptive only, the <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> continued to be charged to the patient until a final determination was made by the state. Once the state made the determination, the budget was re-worked to accommodate a higher need threshold. The end result was a zero <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> for the patient. Another outcome was that the Mrs. P. was eligible to receive reimbursement for the previous <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> payments. With this changed insurance status, the patient (and CRCD financial navigators) could now contact medical billers to mitigate the over $ 80, 000 in medical bills incurred since Mrs. P.’s hospitalization. The entire insurance conversion process took about 6 weeks from the first date of financial navigation at CRCD PNP until MediCal was approved.|$|R

5000|$|Countering {{the cost}} {{advantages}} of electric traction are the cost disadvantages of electrification: primarily {{the costs of}} the catenary and substations (including maintenance costs). It turns out that roughly half of the yearly cost is for depreciation to pay back the original cost of the installation and the other half is for maintenance. [...] An important factor was the use of the railway electric power system in the Soviet Union to supply public power to residences, farms, and non-rail industry which in the early 1970s consisted of about 65% of the electric energy used by trains. Thus the <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> of electrification with external electricity consumers reduces the cost of rail electrification resulting in reduced yearly electrification costs of 15-30%. It's claimed that this cost sharing significantly unfairly favored the external users of electricity {{at the expense of the}} railway. However (in the early 1970s) it's claimed that the annual cost of rail electrification (including maintenance) was only a third to a half of the benefits of savings in fuel costs thus favoring electric traction (if the interest cost of capital is neglected and the traffic is fairly high).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The third Marshall-Hicks-Allen rule of {{elasticity}} of derived demand purports {{to show that}} labor demand is less elastic when labor is a smaller <b>share</b> <b>of</b> total <b>costs.</b> As Hicks, Allen, and then Bronfenbrenner showed, this rule is not quite correct, and actually is complicated by an unexpected negative relationship involving labor’s <b>share</b> <b>of</b> total <b>costs</b> and the {{elasticity of}} substitution. The standard intuitive explanation for {{the exception to the}} rule, attributed to Stigler, describes a situation rather different than the one described in the rule. The author presents an example that illustrates the peculiar negative impact <b>of</b> labor’s <b>share</b> operating via the elasticity of substitution and then explains why the unexpected relationship between labor’s <b>share</b> <b>of</b> total <b>cost,</b> the elasticity <b>of</b> substitution, and the elasticity of labor demand holds...|$|R
