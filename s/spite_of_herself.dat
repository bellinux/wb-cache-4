25|$|Set in two spaces, one {{of which}} {{represents}} the personal life of Marilyn Monroe (1926-1962) and the other which depicts moments of American political and civic life, the story interweaves the myth and decline of the movie star up to her mysterious death, with accounts of significant past events: the Korean war, the McCarthy era investigations, the prosecution of Wilhelm Reich, and the lectures of Timothy Leary {{on the use of}} psychedelic drugs. Marilyn is seen as an involuntary victim of the mass culture of her time, a figure only superficially serene and optimistic, a heroine in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> whose contradictory personality is represented in twelve scenes, equally distributed in the two acts.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Cynthia {{made her}} {{recording}} début with a rendition of [...] "Those Were the Days", which as produced by McCartney {{had been a}} number one hit for Mary Hopkin in 1968. [...] It failed to chart. Whilst living in Normandy, an exhibition of her drawings and paintings were displayed at Portobello Road's KDK Gallery in 1999. [...] By the 1990s she was appearing at some Beatles conventions, but appeared ambivalent about the practice. [...] At times she maintained she was moving {{on with her life}} and putting her Beatles past behind her and at other times seemed to embrace continued interest in that past as inevitable. The Daily Telegraph said in a 1999 profile, [...] "In essence, she is a suburban woman who – almost in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> – got caught up {{with one of the most}} extraordinary men of modern times. More than 30 years since her marriage to John Lennon ended, she is as entangled as ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing Cordelia's {{relationship}} with Xander, Carpenter says, [...] "A lot of Cordy's conflict, {{and a lot}} of who she is, comes out around Xander. Because she is in love with him in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> or in spite of him. I have my best moments with [...]" [...] However, her character's growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern; [...] "I wasn't sure how I felt about it, because I didn't want to lose my edge. I didn't want her to be nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is." [...] Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, [...] "That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [...] not to lose her edge, her honesty." [...] Carpenter claims that Cordelia's [...] "rough edges" [...] made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character. Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire, which the writers let her do in her final Buffy appearance, [...] "Graduation Day, Part Two".|$|E
50|$|In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> declaring <b>herself</b> as a Porno Actress at that time, her {{films were}} not on sale. Months later she {{appeared}} in the Spanish mainstream film Torrente 3: El Protector, directed by Santiago Segura,.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O no; {{its value}} is nothing, comparatively. It {{was only one}} of a pair such as young girls wear.' Lady Constantine could not add that, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> this, she <b>herself</b> valued it as being Swithin's present, and the best he could afford.|$|R
25|$|Theodore Schroeder, a free-speech {{lawyer from}} New York with an amateur {{interest}} in psychology, {{became interested in}} Ida Craddock's case a decade after her death. He began researching her life, and collected {{a large amount of}} her letters, diaries, manuscripts, and other printed materials. Although he never met Craddock he speculated that she had taken at least two human lovers, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> Craddock <b>herself</b> insisting that she had only ever had intercourse with Soph, her spirit husband.|$|R
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. A lot of women auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be a bitch in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. The producers thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. They {{came up with the idea}} for them to be unrelated stepsiblings, who have a romantic encounter, which became the twist for their backstory. When Boone is killed at the end of season one, it forces Shannon into a more adult existence on the Island. Grace noted Boone is [...] "the only person that ever really knew and loved Shannon, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b> Of course, losing him, especially with so much left unsaid and unresolved, will change her irrevocably." [...] This freed her up to develop her relationship with Sayid. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, came up with the idea for Shannon and Sayid relationship. He thought, [...] "What would really shock Middle-America? What if Sayid was to have a relationship with a woman that looked like Miss America? The most unlikely pairing… to come completely from left field." [...] This pairing made Shannon [...] "less flighty... more of a person to be reckoned with." [...] According to Lost producer Carlton Cuse, [...] "The relationships [...] expect on the show are not necessarily the ones that we [...] necessarily are going to give you, but we want to try to find ways in which characters that you don't expect to kind of connect to one another to connect in ways that are kind of surprising." ...|$|E
60|$|Marilla had {{to laugh}} in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b> But her {{conscience}} pricked her.|$|E
60|$|Helen obeyed, {{but almost}} {{instantly}} bent to her plate again, smiling in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed you do, gossip," [...] cried Dart and Skim; for Wing was an {{excellent}} bird, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> the good opinion she had <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R
500|$|In a 2012 interview, Swift {{remarked that}} in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> keeping <b>herself</b> [...] "as educated and {{informed}} as possible", {{she does not}} discuss politics, fearing that it might influence other people. Swift has spent time with the Kennedy family and has spoken of her admiration for Ethel Kennedy. Swift is also a feminist. She has spoken out against LGBT discrimination. Following the 2008 murder of Larry King, she recorded a GLSEN PSA to combat hate crimes. On {{the first anniversary of}} King's death, Swift told Seventeen that her parents taught her [...] "never to judge others based on whom they love, what color their skin is, or their religion". The music video for Swift's anti-bullying song [...] "Mean" [...] deals in part with homophobia in high schools; the video was nominated for an MTV VMA social activism award in 2011. The New York Times believes she is part of [...] "a new wave of young (and mostly straight) women who are providing the soundtrack for a generation of gay fans coming to terms with their identity in a time of turbulent and confusing cultural messages".|$|R
6000|$|... "He is rich, a gentleman, and has {{delightful}} manners," [...] began Amy, {{trying to}} be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> the sincerity of her intentions.|$|R
60|$|In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> {{she could}} not help half a smile, but she said nothing.|$|E
60|$|Even Aileen {{was at a}} {{loss for}} a reply, though she smiled in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
60|$|And {{then she}} laughed in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b> It sounded so like {{an echo of}} Miss Cornelia.|$|E
60|$|The thought {{returned}} {{several times}} that morning, for it was truly a bitter day, and, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> his bear-skin coat, the Doctor shivered. But he had great faith in Rose's good sense, and {{it never occurred to}} him that she was making a little Casabianca <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> with the difference of freezing instead of burning at her post.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was a great}} {{peace and}} thankfulness in her heart at having thus tasted a sort of first-fruits of her little attempt at sowing. It was {{soothing}} a death-bed! Might not she well rejoice that she had persevered, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> the temptation of gain, in not letting her head and heart be carried away with the fever of work, but giving the best part <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> to the task she had undertaken? ...|$|R
60|$|The fresh {{beauty and}} the healthful peace of the hour {{refreshed}} the girl like dew. The human rose lifted up her drooping head and smiled back at the blithe sunshine, as if she found the world a pleasant place, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> her own thorns. Presently a yellow butterfly came wandering by; and she watched it as she walked, pleasing herself with the girlish fancy {{that it was a}} symbol <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R
60|$|EILEEN (forced in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> {{to smile}} with him). You're candid, at any rate, Mr. Murray.|$|E

60|$|Polly spoke so {{calmly and}} earnestly, that Miss Harmer {{felt a little}} startled and uneasy in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
60|$|In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> all Charles's {{attempts}} to prevent her, Alice had persevered in kneeling on one knee, {{until she had}} touched with her lip the hand with which he attempted to raise her. But this salutation ended, she stood upright, with her arms folded on her bosom--her looks humble, but composed, keen, and watchful, and so possessed <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> so little flattered by the communication which the King had supposed would have been overpowering, that he scarce knew in what terms next to urge his solicitation.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} wrong. Lanfear now felt that, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> her perfect tranquillity and self-possession; {{perhaps because of}} it. He had no business to stay there talking with her, {{but he had not}} quite the right to leave her, though practically he had got his dismissal, and apparently she was quite capable of taking care <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> or could have been so in a country where any woman's defencelessness was not any man's advantage. He could not go away without some effort to be of use.|$|R
5000|$|Julie was insistent that Coral was a weak player, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> {{the fact}} that Coral {{outperformed}} her {{in the majority of}} the missions, as CT asserted. When it came {{to the end of the}} game, when Julie said it would be time for strong players like herself to go in, Julie attempted to have Coral nominated a second time instead <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b> The team went against her and then forced her to pick Veronica over Katie, which led to Julie's infamous fight with Coral.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{shook her}} head. In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> the {{kindness}} of Carol's tone brought the tears to her eyes.|$|E
60|$|She giggled as she {{scraped the}} loaf. Even Miriam laughed in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b> Paul mended the fire ruefully.|$|E
60|$|The {{last words}} burst from Maggie, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> {{with a sudden}} drop from patronizing {{instruction}} to simple peevishness.|$|E
5|$|These {{developments}} {{placed the}} regency in considerable difficulties. In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> Apokaukos' adroit {{management of the}} state's finances, the devastation caused by the prolonged wars had emptied the treasury. In August 1343, Empress Anna was forced to pawn the crown jewels to Venice for 30,000 ducats. In addition, Turkish ravages in Thrace led to a scarcity of food in Constantinople. Hoping for Western aid, Anna appealed to the Pope, promising the submission <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> John V, Apokaukos and even the Patriarch to his authority, and began persecuting the pro-Kantakouzenists and anti-Western Palamists.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is not all, Master Isaac,' {{said the}} Duchess, seriously. 'In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> your much-respected name, evil and {{censorious}} tongues {{will have it}} that matters ought to be investigated; {{that there is some}} mystery; that the young woman does not give a satisfactory account <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> and that the child does not resemble either her or your son--in short, that you may be deceived by an impostor, perhaps a Catholic spy. Mind, I say not that I credit all this, only I would show you what reports you must guard against.' ...|$|R

60|$|Victoria {{laughed in}} <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> {{and gave a}} more or less exact though kindly {{imitation}} of Mr. Meader's manner.|$|E
60|$|She {{went back}} to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand. Her face was {{twitching}} in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mary did {{not mean}} to betray any feeling, but in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> she ended in a tremulous tone of vexation.|$|E
60|$|Her lips narrowed tightly. For {{the first}} time in her life Isabella Spencer saw a {{reflection}} <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> looking back at her from her daughter's face--a strange, indefinable resemblance that was more of soul and spirit than of flesh and blood. In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> her anger her heart thrilled to it. As never before, she realized that this girl was her own and her husband's child, a living bond between them wherein their conflicting natures mingled and were reconciled. She realized too, that Rachel, so long sweetly meek and obedient, meant to have her own way in this case--and would have it.|$|R
60|$|When the {{collection}} arrived {{with the last}} hymn, her cousin was again singing resoundingly. And still it amused her. In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> the shameful exhibition she had made <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> it amused her still. She listened to it in a spell of amusement. And the bag was thrust in front of her, and her sixpence was mingled {{in the folds of}} her glove. In her haste to get it out, it flipped away and went twinkling in the next pew. She stood and giggled. She could not help it: she laughed outright, a figure of shame.|$|R
60|$|The danger, and the inutility {{of expressing}} fears which could only perplex her guide, made Venetia silent, {{but she was}} terrified. She could not divest <b>herself</b> <b>of</b> {{apprehension}} about her father and Plantagenet. In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> all he said, {{it was evident that}} her companion was alarmed.|$|R
