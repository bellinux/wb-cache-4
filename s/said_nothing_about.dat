5|$|The Korean {{investigators}} {{cast doubt}} on the U.S. report's suggestion of possible gunfire from among the refugees. Surviving documents <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> infiltrators at No Gun Ri, even though they would have been the 7th Cavalry's first enemy killed-in-action in Korea. The No Gun Ri survivors denied it emphatically, and only three of 52 battalion veterans interviewed by the U.S. team spoke of hostile fire, and then inconsistently.|$|E
5|$|As the two grew older, {{the letters}} became fewer and farther between. There {{was also a}} great deal that they kept to themselves. Jefferson <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> his {{construction}} of a new house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams did not mention the troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Matsui's {{instructions}} <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> {{treatment of}} Chinese POWs. Matsui inadvertently {{contributed to the}} atrocity {{in a major way}} when he demanded on December 14 that his triumphal entrance into Nanking be scheduled for the early date of December 17. At the time his subordinates in Nanking objected because they were {{still in the process of}} scrambling to apprehend all the former Chinese soldiers hiding in the city and had no facilities in which to hold them. Regardless, Matsui held firm, and in many cases his men responded to the conundrum by ordering that all their prisoners be executed immediately after capture. Most of the large-scale massacres that took place within Nanking occurred in the days immediately prior to Matsui's entrance into the city.|$|E

5|$|Following the Australian Open loss, del Potro missed several tournaments, {{including}} the Masters tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami, which were touted as potential return dates, {{due to the}} persistent wrist injury. Even though he withdrew from the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, he regained the world No. 4 ranking, due to Murray's early exit in the second round. He then withdrew from Barcelona and the Rome Masters. On 4 May, del Potro took the option of having an operation to fix the injury. On 19 May, del Potro {{said he would not}} defend his US Open title, but if all went well, he would appear after the event, targeting the Paris Masters as a possible comeback. However, on 22 July, the USTA stated that del Potro was expected to defend his US Open crown. The player himself confirmed that his comeback to the tour would be the Thailand Open and <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the New York event. On 2 August, del Potro returned to the practice courts. A week {{before the start of the}} US Open, after practicing for two weeks, del Potro withdrew from the event, as he felt he was not ready to compete at the highest level.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the book's basic {{accuracy}} countered on {{the points}} raised by skeptics such as footbinding and the Great Wall of China. Historian Stephen G. Haw {{argued that the}} Great Walls were built to keep out northern invaders, whereas the ruling dynasty during Marco Polo's visit were those very northern invaders. They note that the Great Wall familiar to us today is a Ming structure built some two centuries after Marco Polo's travels; and that the Mongol rulers whom Polo served controlled territories both {{north and south of}} today's wall, and would have no reasons to maintain any fortifications that may have remained there from the earlier dynasties. Other Europeans who travelled to Khanbaliq during the Yuan Dynasty, such as Giovanni de' Marignolli and Odoric of Pordenone, <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the wall either. The Muslim traveler Ibn Batutta, who asked about the wall when he visited China during the Yuan Dynasty, could find no one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it, suggesting that while ruins of the wall constructed in the earlier periods might have existed, they were not significant or noteworthy at that time.|$|E
5|$|The bill imposed fines {{on anyone}} who {{imported}} or traded in unlicensed or foreign books, required every book for which copyright protection was sought to be {{entered into the}} Stationers' Register, provided a legal deposit system centred around the King's Library, the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, but <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> limiting the term of copyright. It also specified that books were property; {{an emphasis on the}} idea that authors deserved copyright simply due to their efforts. The Stationers were enthusiastic, urging Parliament to pass the bill, and it received its second reading on 9 February. A Committee of the Whole met to amend it on 21 February, with further alterations made when it was passed back to the House of Commons on 25 February. Alterations during this period included minor changes, such as extending the legal deposit system to cover Sion College and the Faculty of Advocates, but also major ones, including the introduction of a limit on the length of time for which copyright would be granted.|$|E

5|$|The {{subject of}} a {{permanent}} capital for the United States was discussed numerous times during the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, however, the Continental Congress could never agree on a site due to regional loyalties and tensions. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation selected New York City as the nation's temporary capital under the incoming federal government. The framers of the Constitution granted the new U.S. Congress exclusive governing jurisdiction over a federal district, intentionally separate from not beholden to any state. The Constitution, however, <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> where it would be. Discussions during the 1st Congress about where to locate the permanent seat of government revolved around two locations: one site on the Potomac River near Georgetown; and another site on the Susquehanna River near Wrights Ferry (now Columbia, Pennsylvania). The Susquehanna River site {{was approved by the}} House in September 1789, while legislation under consideration in the Senate specified a site on the Delaware River near Germantown, Pennsylvania. No agreement was reached, and the subject was deferred until the second session.|$|E
5|$|Since {{even before}} the {{official}} entry of the United States into World War II in December 1941, Philadelphia had been one on the major industrial war production centers in the U.S. By 1944 Philadelphia was regarded as the second largest war production center in the country. During that period the black population of the city grew substantially, and tensions with the predominantly white population began to increase. The Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) ran the city's huge public transportation system, including subways, buses and trolleys; {{by the time of}} the strike, it carried over one million people per day. By 1944, the PTC's eleven thousand strong workforce included 537 black employees. However, the PTC's black workers had been restricted to holding menial jobs; none were allowed to serve as conductors or motormen – positions that were reserved for white employees. As early as August 1941, black employees started pressuring the PTC for fairer employment practices that would allow upgrading of black workers to the more prestigious jobs hitherto reserved for whites. Their efforts were rebuffed by PTC management, who claimed that the current union contract contained a clause prohibiting any significant change in employment practices and customs without the union's approval (although the contract <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> race). The leader of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Employees Union (PRTEU), Frank Carney, proved to be equally reticent and claimed that he was not authorized by the union members to consider a request to allow promotions of black employees.|$|E

The first official report of fatalities among the hostages came at about 9:00a.m. (despite the death of five children which had been already reported by medical personnel, the official statement claimed there were no children among the dead).|$|E
25|$|Islam came to China {{during the}} Tang dynasty via Iranian traders, who were {{primarily}} concerned with trading and commerce and less concerned with spreading Islam. This low profile is indicated by the 845 anti-Buddhist edict during the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution that <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> Islam. It seems that trade rather than evangelism occupied {{the attention of the}} early Muslim settlers; that while they practised their faith in China, they did not campaign against Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, or the State creed, and that they constituted a floating rather than a fixed element of the population, coming and going between China and the West.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} meeting of the league the {{decision}} memorandum (kararname) <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the reforms, nothing about the schools, nothing about the autonomy or about the union of the Albanian population within one vilayet. It was not an appeal for Albanian independence, or even autonomy within Ottoman Empire but, as proposed by Pashko Vasa, simply the unification of all claimed territory within one vilayet. The participants wanted to return to the status quo before the start of Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. The main aim was to defend from immediate dangers. Soon that position changed radically and resulted in demands of autonomy and open war against the Ottoman Empire as formulated by Abdyl Frashëri.|$|E

25|$|When George Musulin {{organized}} the 1944 final rescue of 500 American airmen called Operation Halyard, Draža Mihailović sent a political mission to Bari, Italy aboard an American plane. The arrival of Pribićević (now former President of the Independent Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), Dr. Vladimir Belajčić (former Justice of the Superior Court of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), Ivan Kovač (a Chetnik representative), and Major Zvonko Vučković (one {{of the principal}} Chetnik commanders) caused the British concern since they had already chosen who to back. At the Bari stopover, Ivan Šubašić, who signed the Treaty of Vis, {{also known as the}} Tito-Šubašić Agreement, earlier that year, met with the members of Mihailović's political mission but the Prime Minister-in-exile <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the agreement he signed months earlier compromising the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

25|$|The {{platforms}} for the {{two major}} national parties were similar in many respects. Both advocated maintaining and strengthening ties with the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada (countries with which the islands had strong cultural and economic links); encouraging and expanding tourism; working to bring British Guiana and British Honduras into the Federation and to obtain loans, financial aid, and technical assistance. Despite these similarities, there were differences. The WIFLP had advocated the encouragement of agriculture while the DLP had promised a climate favourable to both private industry and labour, development of human and economic resources. The WIFLP promised to encourage the Bahamas (in addition to British Guiana and British Honduras) to join the Federation, whereas the DLP did not. The WIFLP also campaigned to establish a central bank for the extension of credit resources and advocated a democratic socialist society and full internal self-government for all the unit territories, whilst avoiding the issues of freedom of movement and a customs union. The DLP <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> full internal self-government, attacked socialism, wished to avoid high taxation (via loans and technical aid) and emphasized West Indian unity, freedom of worship and speech, and encouragement of trade unions.|$|E

(Coffin didn't keep records, but estimated the number to be around 3,000.) When questioned about his motives for aided fugitive slaves, Coffin once replied: [...] "The Bible, in bidding us to feed the hungry and clothe the naked, <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> color, and I should try to follow out the teachings of that good book." [...] He also said, [...] "I thought it was always safe to do right." ...|$|E

Profumo was greatly attracted to Keeler, and promised {{to be in touch}} with her. Ward asked Ivanov to accompany Keeler back to London where, according to Keeler, they had sex.

In a corrective 1977 Village Voice interview, Solanas said the book would not be autobiographical other than a small portion {{and that it would be}} about many things, include proof of statements in the manifesto, and would [...] "deal very intensively with the subject of bullshit", but she <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> parody.|$|E
