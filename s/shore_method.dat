In a 1999 {{expedition}} {{we surveyed}} the non-avian vertebrates recolonizing a volcanic {{island off the}} north coast of Papua New Guinea, and the more recently emerged islet in its caldera lake. It is our intention with this research to document the reassembly of an ecosystem after a cataclysmic event at two temporal stages. Location. Long Island, 55 km north of Papua New Guinea, erupted explosively in the seventeenth century. Its biota was destroyed and the island has been recolonized by animals and plants. From about 1953 to 1968, an island, Motmot, emerged from Long's freshwater caldera lake about 4 km from the nearest <b>shore.</b> <b>Methods.</b> For 15 days in 1999 we surveyed the mammals, reptiles and amphibians of Motmot and the western parts of Long. Results. We assess the present fauna as thirteen mammals, fourteen reptiles and two amphibians. Main conclusions. Long {{appears to have a}} high proportion of tramp-type species in its bat fauna, indicative of a developing biota. Several groups, especially snakes and amphibians, appear to be depauperate compared to the fauna of other islands in the area. On Motmot we recorded only one species of insectivorous bat; its vertebrate fauna is still in the very first stages of development...|$|R

40|$|Intertidal microphytobenthos (MPB) are {{important}} primary producers and provide food for herbivores in soft sediments and on rocky <b>shores.</b> <b>Methods</b> of measuring MPB biomass {{that do not}} depend on the time of collection relative to the time of day or tidal conditions {{are important}} in any studies that need to compare temporal or spatial variation, effects of abiotic factors or activity of grazers. Pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry is often used to estimate biomass of MPB because it is a rapid, non-destructive method, but it is not known how measures of fluorescence are altered by changing conditions during a period of low tide. We investigated this experimentally using in situ changes in minimal fluorescence (F) on a rocky shore and on an estuarine mudflat around Sydney (Australia), during low tides. On rocky shores, the time when samples are taken during low tide had little direct influence on measures of fluorescence as long as the substratum is dry. Wetness from wave-splash, seepage from rock pools, run-off, rainfall, etc., had large consequences for any comparisons. On soft sediments, fluorescence was decreased if the sediment dried out, as happens during low-spring tides on particularly hot and dry days. Surface water affected the response of PAM and therefore measurements used to estimate MPB, emphasising the need for care to ensure that representative sampling is done during low tide.

40|$|Traditionally, {{prestressed}} concrete girder bridges {{are limited to}} 150 ft span lengths in Texas due to restrictions on handling and transportation. An effective way of increasing span lengths of precast, {{prestressed concrete}} girder bridges is demonstrated using splicing technique. In spliced girder bridges, precast girder segments are transported in shorter segments for handling and transportation and then spliced together to form long-span continuous bridges. Different methods are explored for construction of spliced girder bridges. Two application examples are developed to demonstrate the design of continuous prestressed concrete spliced girder bridges for both shored and partially <b>shored</b> <b>methods</b> of construction. A three-span bridge having a span configuration of 190 - 240 - 190 ft is considered for both examples. Advantages and dis-advantages of each method of construction are discussed. Construction issues {{that should be considered}} in the design are highlighted. The results {{of this study indicate that}} span lengths up to 240 ft are achievable using standard Tx 70 girders with the help of splicing techniques. A parametric study is performed to further explore the design space of spliced girder bridges. The results of the parametric study, along with critical design issues that were identified, are highlighted and related recommendations are provided. The results of this study will be of significant interest to bridge engineers and researchers for guidance in implementing spliced girder bridges in Texas and other states...|$|R

The aim of our study was to find out if there was a relation between histamine concentration in synovial fluid and blood with clinical expression of disease activity. Methods. Histamine concentration in synovial fluid and blood was determinated in 19 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Histamine concentration measurement was based on the <b>Shore's</b> fluorometric <b>method.</b> Histamine index (HI) was evaluated as a ratio between histamine concentration in synovial fluid and blood. Disease activity score, DAS 28 (3), with three variables (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the number of swelled joints and the number of tender joints) was also evaluated. Results. Our results showed that {{there was no significant difference}} in concentration of histamine in synovial fluid and blood related to disease activity. However, there was a significant difference in the histamine index which was increased proportionally with disease activity. Conclusion. Our study indicates that histamine index could be useful in estimation of rheumatoid arthritis activity...|$|R

In California during the 19th Century whales could be winched ashore either at a sandy beach or, {{in the case}} of the Carmel Bay station just south of Monterey, they were brought to the side of a stone-laid quay to be flensed. Cutting-tackles were suspended from an elevated beam, allowing the whalemen to roll the carcass over in the water for flensing similar to a whaleship. On Norfolk Island humpback whales were flensed in the shallows along a rocky beach. Men sliced the blubber from the lean with the assistance of a winch.|$|R
40|$|In construction, bridges {{are one of}} {{the most}} used ways to over come obstacles. To be more precious, bridges are used to connect transportaion {{channels}} like roads, railroads, canals, or over construction tools like channels, electric poles. Also bridges are used in order to over come natural obstacles like rivers, bays, valleys and so on or man made obstacles like highways,railroads, bridges are also the most important key to a transportation system because of the importance of bridges. The metal bridges competition benefit increasingly becoming more important. There are many construction methods for bridges, e. g., precast prestressing I-beam cantilever method, full-span precast launching <b>method,</b> advanced <b>shoring</b> <b>method,</b> incremental launching method, cast balanced cantilever method, precast segmental cantilever method, steel pipe outrigger trussing <b>method,</b> on-site <b>shoring</b> <b>method,</b> etc. However, this study probes solely into the precast segmental cantilever method for incremental launching method bridges with local shoring. Exploration of potential problems encountered in the process of designing and constructing of the bridges is performed. The measures for handling the problems and finally an autonomous checklist are created for builders' references. The inner stress generated in various phases of the construction method might exceed the load-carrying capacity designed. Whether the attentions have been paid to the correct prestressing order is key to the success of the bridge construction. The method should carry out structural analysis along with the construction steps to confirm the stresses at any phrase are all in their allowable ranges. the scope of secondary allowance of inner stress. Study of the possible failure modes of the bridges after completion is also made herein and the likely failure load based upon the findings is proposed for designer's reference.

40|$|Protection of sea coasts often {{refers to}} the {{manipulation}} of environmental processes {{on the level of}} coast within spatial and time scale. It should be aimed at coastline preservation together with saving of the natural environment. Within the worldwide trend in shore protection, activities friendly to environment have been lately very much preferred. In many countries, recommendations existing in the framework of various legal regulation imply use of soft and ecologically friendly measures (e. g. artificial beach nourishment) while hard solutions (like seawalls, revetments and groins) are most often declined. In most European Union countries, due to various requirements and restrictions, a limited number of <b>shore</b> protection <b>methods</b> can be applied. An ultimate choice of the optimal option depends on site-specific issues. The sustainable (environmentally friendly) available solutions, aside from artificial nourishment (either by dumping from a hopper dredger/barge or by pumping of the water-soil mixture using a hydro-monitor or by beach fills made directly on the emerged part of a shore), comprise bio-technical shore protection by use of sand-trapping fences, brushwood and special types of grass, bushes and trees. Besides, protective measures based on geo-textiles are widely used, e. g. in the form of Geotubes and Geocontainers constituting cores of such massive structures like detached breakwaters (both emerged and submerged). 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The fate of reef islands is a {{topic of}} ongoing debate {{in the face of}} climate change-induced sea-level rise and {{increased}} cyclone intensity. Increased erosion and changes to the supply of reef-derived sediment may put sand reef cays at risk of dramatic morphological changes. These changes may have negative implications for the existence of reef cay environments, which host vital sea turtle and bird rookery habitats. Beachrock, consolidated carbonate beach sediment in the intertidal zone, forms naturally on many tropical beaches and reduces the erosion rates of these beaches when compared to unconsolidated sand. In spite of the critical role beachrock plays in stabilizing some reef cay <b>shores,</b> the <b>method</b> of beachrock formation is still incompletely understood. In this investigation, beachrock was synthesized using beach sand and beachrock samples from Heron Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) in aquarium experiments in which natural beachrock formation conditions were simulated. Beachrock was produced in two aquaria wherein the water chemistry was influenced by microorganisms derived from the natural beachrock âinoculumâ, whereas no cementation occurred in an aquarium that lacked a microbial inoculum and was controlled only by physicochemical evapoconcentration. The new cements in the synthesized beachrock were analyzed using synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy and were identified using a Sr-tracer added to the experimental seawater. The resulting precipitates cement sand grains together and contain abundant microfossils of the microorganisms on whose exopolymer they nucleated, demonstrating the fundamental role microbes play in beachrock formation.

40|$|The grain-size {{samples taken}} from opened {{sections}} of the cores consisted of 10 cc of sediment. Project directions for the actual sampling procedure were followed; however, personal judgment, in most cases, governed the decision as to where in the core the actual sample was taken. More often than not, specific coarse-grained silt or sand units (turbidite layers), or ash-bearing units were sampled. Therefore, the data presented in the accompanying charts and tables {{should not be considered}} as derived from a random sampling program. It is also highly probable that some of the sand units sampled had been subjected to washing during core-barrel retrieval. The data presented for these sand units should be interpreted carefully. Core sections that were highly deformed were sampled only if a distinct coarse-grained lithology was present. The <b>shore</b> laboratory <b>method</b> of grain-size analysis followed standard methods as outlined in the DSDP project manual. In general, the methods consisted of sediment dispersal in a Calgon solution, or other suitable dispersant, using an ultrasonic bath. Sand and any coarser fractions were sieved, while the silt and clay fractions were analyzed by pipette methods. There were 113 samples taken for grain-size analysis, and 23 of these samples were further analyzed for detailed size determinations in the sand- and silt-size fractions (Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2). NOMENCLATURE The size analyses are plotted on a triangular diagram (Figure 1) which has sand, silt, and clay as end members (Shepard, 1954). The nomenclature used (Table 1) is also in accordance with that of Shepard (1954). The nomenclature sand, silt, and clay do not imply any compositional characteristics.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 We {{study the}} {{development}} of two numerical algorithms for long nonlinear wave runup that utilize the generalized Carrier-Greenspan transform. The Carrier-Greenspan transform is a hodograph transform that allows the Shallow Water Wave equations to {{be transformed into a}} linear second order wave equation with nonconstant coefficients. In both numerical algorithms the transform is numerically implemented, the resulting linear system is numerically solved and then the inverse transformation is implemented. The first method we develop is based on an implicit finite difference method and is applicable to constantly sloping bays of arbitrary cross-section. The resulting scheme is extremely fast and shows promise as a fast tsunami runup solver for wave runup in coastal fjords and narrow inlets. For the second scheme, we develop an initial value boundary problem corresponding to an Inclined bay with U or V shaped cross-sections that has a wall some distance from the <b>shore.</b> A spectral <b>method</b> is applied to the resulting linear equation in order to and a series solution. Both methods are verified against an analytical solution in an inclined parabolic bay with positive results and the first scheme is compared to the 3 D numerical solver FUNWAVE with positive results...|$|R
40|$|Impulse {{waves in}} oceans, bays, lakes, or {{reservoirs}} are generated by landslides, rock falls, shore instabilities, snow avalanches, glacier calvings, or meteorite impacts. Examples are the 1958 Lituya Bay case in Alaska where the generated impulse wave reached a maximum run-up height of 524 m {{on the opposite}} shore or the 1963 Vaiont case in North Italy where an impulse wave overtopped a dam by about 70 m and killed 2, 000 people. The mainly passive methods to face such catastrophes include evacuations, water level draw-down, or freeboard control in artificial reservoirs. They require detailed knowledge of the wave features and of the wave effects on the dam or <b>shore</b> line. Numerical <b>methods</b> such as SPH may {{play an important role}} in the future in predicting the effects of impulse waves since numerical models may result in more accurate predictions for complex geometries than general physical model studies at lower costs than specific physical case studies (Heller et al. 2009). This test case is one out of three experiments presented in Heller (2007), conducted in a wave channel with a still water depth h = 0. 300 m. The results include the granular slide deformation prior and during impact into the water body, the wave generation including the temporal advance of velocity vector fields measured with Particle Image Velocimetry PIV, and the wave profiles measured with seven Capacitance Wave Gages CWGs. <br/...|$|R

The transgression was followed by a long-term lake phase, which ended, due to overgrowth of the basin, at ca. 2900 14 C yr BP (ca. 3000 cal yr BP). The highest Ancylus shoreline in the area is lo-cated at 71 m a. s. l. The altitude of the ancient Pennala Lake is located at 68. 5 m a. s. l. The Pennala basin and adjacent areas were inhabited by Stone Age dwellers during the Middle Neolithic period. The dated evidence of the Early Mesolithic settlement in the area remains scarce.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} accelerated ageing on the tensile strength, elongation at break, hardness and Charpy impact strength in commercial PMMA denture base material modified with di-methyl itaconate (DMI) and di-n-butyl itaconate (DBI). The samples were prepared by modifying commercial formulation by addition of itaconates in the amounts of 2. 5, 5, 7. 5 and 10 % by weight. After polymerization samples were characterized by FT-IR and DSC analysis while residual monomer content was determined by HPLC-UV. Accelerated ageing was performed at 70 Â°C in water for periods of 7, 15 and 30 days. Tensile measurements were performed using Instron testing machine while the hardness of the polymerized samples was measured by <b>Shore</b> D <b>method.</b> The addition of itaconate significantly reduces the residual MMA. Even at the small amounts of added itaconates (2. 5 %) the residual MMA content was reduced by 50 %. The increase of itaconate content in the system leads to the decrease of residual MMA. It {{has been found that}} the addition of di-n-alkyl itaconates decreases the tensile strength, hardness and Charpy impact strength and increases elongation at break. Samples modified with DMI had higher values of tensile strength, hardness and Charpy impact strength compared to the ones modified with DBI. This is {{explained by the fact that}} DBI has longer side chain compared to DMI. After accelerated ageing during a 30 days period the tensile strength decreased for all the investigated samples. The addition of DMI had no effect on the material ageing and the values for the tensile strength of all of the investigated samples decreased around 20 %, while for the samples modified with DBI, the increase of the amount of DBI in the polymerized material leads to the higher decrease of the tensile strength after the complete accelerated ageing period od 30 days, aulthough after the first seven days of the accelerated ageing the values of hardness have increased for all of the investigated samples. Such behavior is explained as the result of the polymer chain relaxation. The values of Charpy impact strength decreased after accelerated ageing. The amount of added DMI have no affect on the decrease of Charpy impact strength after accelerated ageing, the decrease was similar as for pure PMMA. The decrease of Charpy impact strength increased as the amount of added DBI increases...|$|R

This method of rescue is also referred to as a [...] "live bait rescue", where the rescuer swims to the aid of the victim while tethered to a team member at an anchor point, very much like bait on a hook {{at the end of a}} fishing pole. For example, a parent with children trapped in a vehicle in flowing water that needs to extricate and control scared or injured children on to the roof of the vehicle (there is a greater than 50% chance of dying in a vehicle that is flooded). If that platform (car, rock, bridge, roof etc.) becomes unstable or begins to succumb to rising water, that rescuer may need to tow a victim to the shore, eddy or pre-planned egress point.

40|$|Purpose: Determination of the {{influence}} of a dye addition and electrochemical ageing on the change of dynamic mechanical properties, investigated by DMTA method for samples made of polypropylene was the aim of this work. The investigation of crystallinity degree using DSC method as well as the investigation of the structure using optical microscopy have been made. Hardness by ball indentation <b>method,</b> <b>Shore</b> hardness, Vicat softening point and water absorptivity were tested. Design/methodology/approach: Investigation using DMTA method was carried out for samples subjected to one-axial bending. The change {{in the value of the}} storage modulus Eâ and the mechanical loss factor (tangent Î´) in function of the temperature and oscillation frequency in DMTA tests were determined. In order to verify the change of thermal properties of PP with 2 % of dye addition, before and after electrochemical ageing, the investigation using DSC method was made. Findings: Higher values of the storage modulus occurred for the samples with dye addition. The crystallinity degree values were lower for the samples after electrochemical ageing. It was found that electrochemical ageing results in decrease in hardness values and Vicat softening temperature while increase in water absorptivity was noticed. Research limitations/implications: Dynamic properties of polypropylene with the dye addition were determined in one-axial bending test. In real application, the parts manufactured from this material can be subjected to more complex load. Practical implications: The investigation results let know about dyed polypropylene behaviour after ageing, what can be useful in practice, when selecting the material for parts that will have to work in conditions of electrochemical ageing.

Fish were stocked {{in the spring}} and fall as fingerlings and monitored by creel censusing, gill netting and electrofishing. Fish were tagged with coded wire snout tags prior to stocking. An angler opinion survey was conducted to determine angler satisfaction with numbers and size of fish caught. Regardless of strain, spring stocking was superior to fall stocking in survival to the creel. In the spring 78 stocking the Ten Sleep strain had the highest survival to the creel (33. 7 percent), followed in order by Shepherd-of-the-Hills (11. 0 percent), Beitey (5. 5 percent), Sand Creek (5. 4 percent), New Zealand (4. 1 percent), and Fish Lake-Desmet (2. 9 percent). In the spring 79 stocking the Shepherd-of-the- Hills strain had the highest survival to the creel (7. 6 percent), followed in order by the Sand Creek (7. 3 percent) and the Ten Sleep (6. 5 percent). Similar trends in survival were found in gill netting and electrofishing samples. Migration out of the reservoir was negligible for each strain. There were no strain differences in catchability by different <b>methods</b> (<b>shore,</b> boat) or gear (bait, artificial lure). Differences in growth between the fastest growing strains (Ten Sleep, Sand Creek) and the slowest growing strains (New Zealand, Fish Lake-Desmet) averaged as great as 16 mm in length and 43 g in weight. Differences in growth and survival among strains were great enough to span the range of angler satisfaction with numbers caught and size of fish caught from satisfactory to unsatisfactory. Therefore, strain selection can be a useful tool to improve fingerling stocking programs and manipulate the number of anglers who are satisfied with the angling experience...|$|R
