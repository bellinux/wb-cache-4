In a 1999 {{expedition}} {{we surveyed}} the non-avian vertebrates recolonizing a volcanic {{island off the}} north coast of Papua New Guinea, and the more recently emerged islet in its caldera lake. It is our intention with this research to document the reassembly of an ecosystem after a cataclysmic event at two temporal stages. Location. Long Island, 55 km north of Papua New Guinea, erupted explosively in the seventeenth century. Its biota was destroyed and the island has been recolonized by animals and plants. From about 1953 to 1968, an island, Motmot, emerged from Long's freshwater caldera lake about 4 km from the nearest <b>shore.</b> <b>Methods.</b> For 15 days in 1999 we surveyed the mammals, reptiles and amphibians of Motmot and the western parts of Long.

Long {{appears to have a}} high proportion of tramp-type species in its bat fauna, indicative of a developing biota. Several groups, especially snakes and amphibians, appear to be depauperate compared to the fauna of other islands in the area.

40|$|Intertidal microphytobenthos (MPB) are {{important}} primary producers and provide food for herbivores in soft sediments and on rocky <b>shores.</b> <b>Methods</b> of measuring MPB biomass {{that do not}} depend on the time of collection relative to the time of day or tidal conditions {{are important}} in any studies that need to compare temporal or spatial variation, effects of abiotic factors or activity of grazers. Pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry is often used to estimate biomass of MPB because it is a rapid, non-destructive method, but it is not known how measures of fluorescence are altered by changing conditions during a period of low tide. We investigated this experimentally using in situ changes in minimal fluorescence (F) on a rocky shore and on an estuarine mudflat around Sydney (Australia), during low tides. On rocky shores, the time when samples are taken during low tide had little direct influence on measures of fluorescence as long as the substratum is dry. Wetness from wave-splash, seepage from rock pools, run-off, rainfall, etc., had large consequences for any comparisons. On soft sediments, fluorescence was decreased if the sediment dried out, as happens during low-spring tides on particularly hot and dry days. Surface water affected the response of PAM and therefore measurements used to estimate MPB, emphasising the need for care to ensure that representative sampling is done during low tide. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Traditionally, {{prestressed}} concrete girder bridges {{are limited to}} 150 ft span lengths in Texas due to restrictions on handling and transportation. An effective way of increasing span lengths of precast, {{prestressed concrete}} girder bridges is demonstrated using splicing technique. In spliced girder bridges, precast girder segments are transported in shorter segments for handling and transportation and then spliced together to form long-span continuous bridges. Different methods are explored for construction of spliced girder bridges. Two application examples are developed to demonstrate the design of continuous prestressed concrete spliced girder bridges for both shored and partially <b>shored</b> <b>methods</b> of construction. A three-span bridge having a span configuration of 190 - 240 - 190 ft is considered for both examples. Advantages and dis-advantages of each method of construction are discussed. Construction issues {{that should be considered}} in the design are highlighted. The results {{of this study indicate that}} span lengths up to 240 ft are achievable using standard Tx 70 girders with the help of splicing techniques. A parametric study is performed to further explore the design space of spliced girder bridges.

The metal bridges competition benefit increasingly becoming more important. There are many construction methods for bridges, e. g., precast prestressing I-beam cantilever method, full-span precast launching <b>method,</b> advanced <b>shoring</b> <b>method,</b> incremental launching method, cast balanced cantilever method, precast segmental cantilever method, steel pipe outrigger trussing <b>method,</b> on-site <b>shoring</b> <b>method,</b> etc. However, this study probes solely into the precast segmental cantilever method for incremental launching method bridges with local shoring. Exploration of potential problems encountered in the process of designing and constructing of the bridges is performed. The measures for handling the problems and finally an autonomous checklist are created for builders' references. The inner stress generated in various phases of the construction method might exceed the load-carrying capacity designed. Whether the attentions have been paid to the correct prestressing order is key to the success of the bridge construction. The method should carry out structural analysis along with the construction steps to confirm the stresses at any phrase are all in their allowable ranges. the scope of secondary allowance of inner stress. Study of the possible failure modes of the bridges after completion is also made herein and the likely failure load based upon the findings is proposed for designer's reference. 橋梁是一種用來跨越障礙的大型構造物。確切的說是用來將交通路線 (如道路、鐵路、水道等) 或者其他設施 (如管道、電纜等) 跨越天然障礙 (如河流、海峽、峽谷等) 或人工障礙 (高速公路、鐵路線) 的構造物。也是交通運輸系統中最關鍵環節之一，由於橋樑之地位不可或缺，鋼結構橋樑之競爭優勢也日益增加。 然而橋梁施工方法甚多，例如預鑄預力I形梁吊裝工法、全跨預鑄工法、支撐先進工法、節塊推進工法、場鑄懸臂工法、預鑄節塊吊裝工法、鋼管桁架橋梁工法、就地支撐法…等，本文僅就「節塊推進工法」加以探討。橋梁施工法在設計上及施工上可能發生之問題進行探討並提出因應對策，再據而提出施工自主檢查表以供施工者參考，本工法施工中各階段所產生之內部應力可能超出設計之荷重能量，在進行施工計畫時需注意施加預力順序之正確性乃本橋樑結構成敗之關鍵。本工法應配合各施工階段進行結構分析，以隨時確認內部應力之容許範圍。本文亦進行完工後之可能破壞模式探討，並據以提出可能之破壞荷重，以供設計者參考。目錄 中文摘要	I 英文摘要	II 目錄	III 表目錄	IV 圖目錄	V 第一章 緒論 一、前言	 1 二、研究動機與目的	 4 三、橋梁的型式及力學原理	 4 四、橋梁的演進	 6 五、橋梁的規劃設計	 9 六、研究目的及內容	 10 第二章 相關研究文獻回顧 一、橋梁工法的分類	 11 二、各種橋梁施工法概述 (一) 預鑄預力I形梁吊裝工法	 12 (二) 場撐逐跨工法	 15 (三) 基樁式墩柱橋梁工法	 19 (四) 支撐先進工法	 20 (五) 節塊推進工法	 25 (六) 場鑄懸臂工法	 32 (七) 預鑄節塊吊裝工法	 37 (八) 預鑄斜撐板工法	 42 (九) 全跨預鑄吊裝工法	 45 (十) 斜張橋	 52 (十一) 降拱施工法	 60 (十二) 斜張式外露鋼腱橋梁工法	 61 (十三) 板拉橋施工法	 62 (十四) 鋼管桁架橋梁工法	 62 (十五) Y型柱全跨支撐預鑄節塊吊裝工法	 63 第三章 各種橋梁施工法的比較與分析 一、各橋梁施工法施工速率的比較	 64 二、各橋梁施工法造價與跨徑長度及橋墩高度的關係比較	 65 三、各橋梁施工法適用狀況之比較	 66 四、各橋梁施工法優缺點比較	 67 第四章 節塊推進工法及施工中自主檢查表研擬	 70 一、工法概述	 70 二、施工期間之設計考量	 72 三、施工設備	 74 四、施工步驟	 79 五、施工計實	 90 六、節塊推進工法於施工中易發生之問題與因應對策	 95 七、施工中自主檢查表研擬	 103 第五章節塊推進工法橋梁之破壞模式探討 一、前言	 119 二、破壞模式之探討	 120 第六章 結論	 127 參考文獻	 128 表目錄 表 3. 3. 1 各種橋梁適用狀況一覽表	 66 表 3. 4. 1 各橋梁施工法優缺點一覽表	 67 表 4. 6. 1 施工設備組裝自主檢查表	 105 表 4. 6. 2 預鑄床整理自主檢查表	 106 表 4. 6. 3 橋柱放樣自主檢查表	 107 表 4. 6. 4 橋柱鋼筋施工自主檢查表	 108 表 4. 6. 5 橋柱模板施工自主檢查表	 109 表 4. 6. 6 鋼鉸支承構件預埋自主檢查表	 110 表 4. 6. 7 混凝土施工自主檢查表	 111 表 4. 6. 8 橋樑節塊底座施工自主檢查表	 112 表 4. 6. 9 橋樑節塊鋼模施工自主檢查表	 113 表 4. 6. 10 預鑄節塊鋼筋施工自主檢查表	 114 表 4. 6. 11 預鑄節塊混凝土施工自主檢查表	 115 表 4. 6. 12 節塊推進自主檢查表	 116 表 4. 6. 13 預鑄節塊預力施拉作業自主檢查表	 117 表 4. 6. 14 附屬工程自主檢查表	 118 圖目錄 圖 1. 2. 1 版橋	 5 圖 1. 2. 2 梁式橋	 5 圖 1. 2. 3 拱橋	 5 圖 1. 2. 4 懸索橋	 5 圖 1. 3. 1 木橋(人行景觀橋) 	 8 圖 1. 3. 2 竹橋(溪頭大學池) 	 8 圖 1. 3. 3 圬工橋(國姓糯米橋) 	 8 圖 1. 3. 4 混凝土橋(國道彰化二號橋) 	 8 圖 1. 3. 5 鋼橋(西螺大橋) 	 8 圖 2. 2. 1 預鑄預力I形梁吊裝工法	 12 圖 2. 2. 2 預鑄預力 I型梁作業流程圖	 14 圖 2. 2. 3 場撐逐跨工法	 15 圖 2. 2. 4 場撐逐跨工法作業流程圖	 18 圖 2. 2. 5 基樁式墩柱橋梁工法	 19 圖 2. 2. 6 支撐先進工法	 20 圖 2. 2. 7 節塊推進工法	 26 圖 2. 2. 8 節塊推進工法作業流程圖	 30 圖 2. 2. 9 場鑄懸臂施工法	 32 圖 2. 2. 10 場鑄懸臂施工法作業流程圖	 36 圖 2. 2. 11 預鑄節塊吊裝工法	 38 圖 2. 2. 12 預鑄節塊吊裝工法作業流程圖	 41 圖 2. 2. 13 預鑄斜撐板工法	 43 圖 2. 2. 14 預鑄斜撐板工法施工示意圖	 44 圖 2. 2. 15 全跨預鑄吊裝工法	 45 圖 2. 2. 16 全跨預鑄吊裝工法作業流程圖	 51 圖 2. 2. 17 斜張橋	 53 圖 2. 2. 18 降拱施工法	 61 圖 2. 2. 19 斜張式外露鋼腱橋梁工法	 61 圖 2. 2. 20 板拉橋施工法	 62 圖 2. 2. 21 鋼管桁架橋梁工法	 63 圖 2. 2. 22 Y型柱局部支撐預鑄節塊吊裝工法	 63 圖 3. 1. 1 各橋梁工法施工速率的比較	 64 圖 3. 2. 1 橋梁造價比較-橋墩高度與跨徑數之關係	 65 圖 4. 1. 1 推進工法	 71 圖 4. 1. 2 拉進工法	 72 圖 4. 3. 1 預鑄床混凝土基座	 74 圖 4. 3. 2 預鑄床全景	 74 圖 4. 3. 3 支承鋼梁及升降千斤頂	 75 圖 4. 3. 4 系統模板	 75 圖 4. 3. 5 推進導軌	 76 圖 4. 3. 6 推進千斤頂	 76 圖 4. 3. 7 臨時滑動墊座	 76 圖 4. 3. 8 側制導架	 77 圖 4. 3. 9 鼻梁	 77 圖 4. 3. 10 臨時橋墩	 78 圖 4. 4. 1 外模組裝	 79 圖 4. 4. 2 內模組裝	 80 圖 4. 4. 3 側制導架組裝	 80 圖 4. 4. 4 鼻梁與第一節快結合	 81 圖 4. 4. 5 臨時橋墩組裝	 81 圖 4. 4. 6 外模定位調整	 81 圖 4. 4. 7 底、腹板鋼筋綁紮	 82 圖 4. 4. 8 頂板混凝土澆置	 82 圖 4. 4. 9 頂板模組立	 83 圖 4. 4. 10 頂板鋼筋綁紮及預力套管安裝	 83 圖 4. 4. 11 永久支承墊換裝	 84 圖 4. 4. 12 混凝土澆置前檢查	 86 圖 4. 4. 13 施拉預力檢查	 86 圖 4. 4. 14 推進千斤頂系統檢查	 87 圖 4. 5. 1 伸縮縫塑膠膜披覆	 93 圖 4. 5. 2 高拉力鋼棒安裝	 93 圖 4. 5. 3 混凝土養護	 93 圖 5. 1. 1 箱型梁基本斷面	 120 圖 5. 1. 2 連續箱型橋樑上部結構破壞機構示意圖	 123 圖 5. 1. 3 彎矩及剪力同時破壞下線性方程	 12...|$|R

It should be aimed at coastline preservation together with saving of the natural environment. Within the worldwide trend in shore protection, activities friendly to environment have been lately very much preferred. In many countries, recommendations existing in the framework of various legal regulation imply use of soft and ecologically friendly measures (e. g. artificial beach nourishment) while hard solutions (like seawalls, revetments and groins) are most often declined. In most European Union countries, due to various requirements and restrictions, a limited number of <b>shore</b> protection <b>methods</b> can be applied. An ultimate choice of the optimal option depends on site-specific issues. The sustainable (environmentally friendly) available solutions, aside from artificial nourishment (either by dumping from a hopper dredger/barge or by pumping of the water-soil mixture using a hydro-monitor or by beach fills made directly on the emerged part of a shore), comprise bio-technical shore protection by use of sand-trapping fences, brushwood and special types of grass, bushes and trees. Besides, protective measures based on geo-textiles are widely used, e. g. in the form of Geotubes and Geocontainers constituting cores of such massive structures like detached breakwaters (both emerged and submerged). 1...|$|R

In this investigation, beachrock was synthesized using beach sand and beachrock samples from Heron Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) in aquarium experiments in which natural beachrock formation conditions were simulated.

40|$|The grain-size {{samples taken}} from opened {{sections}} of the cores consisted of 10 cc of sediment. Project directions for the actual sampling procedure were followed; however, personal judgment, in most cases, governed the decision as to where in the core the actual sample was taken. More often than not, specific coarse-grained silt or sand units (turbidite layers), or ash-bearing units were sampled. Therefore, the data presented in the accompanying charts and tables {{should not be considered}} as derived from a random sampling program. It is also highly probable that some of the sand units sampled had been subjected to washing during core-barrel retrieval. The data presented for these sand units should be interpreted carefully. Core sections that were highly deformed were sampled only if a distinct coarse-grained lithology was present. The <b>shore</b> laboratory <b>method</b> of grain-size analysis followed standard methods as outlined in the DSDP project manual. In general, the methods consisted of sediment dispersal in a Calgon solution, or other suitable dispersant, using an ultrasonic bath. Sand and any coarser fractions were sieved, while the silt and clay fractions were analyzed by pipette methods. There were 113 samples taken for grain-size analysis, and 23 of these samples were further analyzed for detailed size determinations in the sand- and silt-size fractions (Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2).

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 We {{study the}} {{development}} of two numerical algorithms for long nonlinear wave runup that utilize the generalized Carrier-Greenspan transform. The Carrier-Greenspan transform is a hodograph transform that allows the Shallow Water Wave equations to {{be transformed into a}} linear second order wave equation with nonconstant coefficients. In both numerical algorithms the transform is numerically implemented, the resulting linear system is numerically solved and then the inverse transformation is implemented. The first method we develop is based on an implicit finite difference method and is applicable to constantly sloping bays of arbitrary cross-section. The resulting scheme is extremely fast and shows promise as a fast tsunami runup solver for wave runup in coastal fjords and narrow inlets. For the second scheme, we develop an initial value boundary problem corresponding to an Inclined bay with U or V shaped cross-sections that has a wall some distance from the <b>shore.</b> A spectral <b>method</b> is applied to the resulting linear equation in order to and a series solution.

40|$|Impulse {{waves in}} oceans, bays, lakes, or {{reservoirs}} are generated by landslides, rock falls, shore instabilities, snow avalanches, glacier calvings, or meteorite impacts. Examples are the 1958 Lituya Bay case in Alaska where the generated impulse wave reached a maximum run-up height of 524 m {{on the opposite}} shore or the 1963 Vaiont case in North Italy where an impulse wave overtopped a dam by about 70 m and killed 2, 000 people. The mainly passive methods to face such catastrophes include evacuations, water level draw-down, or freeboard control in artificial reservoirs. They require detailed knowledge of the wave features and of the wave effects on the dam or <b>shore</b> line. Numerical <b>methods</b> such as SPH may {{play an important role}} in the future in predicting the effects of impulse waves since numerical models may result in more accurate predictions for complex geometries than general physical model studies at lower costs than specific physical case studies (Heller et al. 2009).

The samples were prepared by modifying commercial formulation by addition of itaconates in the amounts of 2. 5, 5, 7. 5 and 10 % by weight. After polymerization samples were characterized by FT-IR and DSC analysis while residual monomer content was determined by HPLC-UV. Accelerated ageing was performed at 70 °C in water for periods of 7, 15 and 30 days. Tensile measurements were performed using Instron testing machine while the hardness of the polymerized samples was measured by <b>Shore</b> D <b>method.</b> The addition of itaconate significantly reduces the residual MMA. Even at the small amounts of added itaconates (2. 5 %) the residual MMA content was reduced by 50 %. The increase of itaconate content in the system leads to the decrease of residual MMA. It {{has been found that}} the addition of di-n-alkyl itaconates decreases the tensile strength, hardness and Charpy impact strength and increases elongation at break. Samples modified with DMI had higher values of tensile strength, hardness and Charpy impact strength compared to the ones modified with DBI. This is {{explained by the fact that}} DBI has longer side chain compared to DMI. After accelerated ageing during a 30 days period the tensile strength decreased for all the investigated samples. The addition of DMI had no effect on the material ageing and the values for the tensile strength of all of the investigated samples decreased around 20 %, while for the samples modified with DBI, the increase of the amount of DBI in the polymerized material leads to the higher decrease of the tensile strength after the complete accelerated ageing period od 30 days, aulthough after the first seven days of the accelerated ageing the values of hardness have increased for all of the investigated samples. Such behavior is explained as the result of the polymer chain relaxation. The values of Charpy impact strength decreased after accelerated ageing. The amount of added DMI have no affect on the decrease of Charpy impact strength after accelerated ageing, the decrease was similar as for pure PMMA. The decrease of Charpy impact strength increased as the amount of added DBI increases...|$|R
5000|$|In certain situations, {{such as an}} {{unconscious}} patient, one might [...] "go and tow" [...] the victim back to <b>shore.</b> Unlike other <b>methods</b> of rescue, the rescuer now enters {{the water in a}} swimming capacity. This method of rescue is also referred to as a [...] "live bait rescue", where the rescuer swims to the aid of the victim while tethered to a team member at an anchor point, very much like bait on a hook {{at the end of a}} fishing pole. For example, a parent with children trapped in a vehicle in flowing water that needs to extricate and control scared or injured children on to the roof of the vehicle (there is a greater than 50% chance of dying in a vehicle that is flooded). If that platform (car, rock, bridge, roof etc.) becomes unstable or begins to succumb to rising water, that rescuer may need to tow a victim to the shore, eddy or pre-planned egress point. Towing rescues are extremely difficult and require training with a practiced rescuer as a victim. Actual tows with scared, hypothermic, exhausted, injured or panicked victims are extremely difficult and dangerous for both parties and should be left to rescuers well versed in proper rescuer/victim communication, holds, and swimming techniques. When a victim is not accessible from any of the previous rescue methods, resources permitting, a helicopter rescue may be attempted. A helicopter, or [...] "helo", is a stable rescue platform from which a variety of rescue methods can be initiated. While the helicopter must be equipped for rescue work, the crew must be equipped, trained and well practiced in the art of swift water rescue ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Determination of the {{influence}} of a dye addition and electrochemical ageing on the change of dynamic mechanical properties, investigated by DMTA method for samples made of polypropylene was the aim of this work. The investigation of crystallinity degree using DSC method as well as the investigation of the structure using optical microscopy have been made. Hardness by ball indentation <b>method,</b> <b>Shore</b> hardness, Vicat softening point and water absorptivity were tested. Design/methodology/approach: Investigation using DMTA method was carried out for samples subjected to one-axial bending. The change {{in the value of the}} storage modulus E’ and the mechanical loss factor (tangent δ) in function of the temperature and oscillation frequency in DMTA tests were determined. In order to verify the change of thermal properties of PP with 2 % of dye addition, before and after electrochemical ageing, the investigation using DSC method was made. Findings: Higher values of the storage modulus occurred for the samples with dye addition. The crystallinity degree values were lower for the samples after electrochemical ageing. It was found that electrochemical ageing results in decrease in hardness values and Vicat softening temperature while increase in water absorptivity was noticed. Research limitations/implications: Dynamic properties of polypropylene with the dye addition were determined in one-axial bending test. In real application, the parts manufactured from this material can be subjected to more complex load. Practical implications: The investigation results let know about dyed polypropylene behaviour after ageing, what can be useful in practice, when selecting the material for parts that will have to work in conditions of electrochemical ageing. Originality/value: In order to estimate the polymer behaviour in different thermal conditions, dependences of the storage modulus and the mechanical loss factor were determined in function of temperature in one-axial bending...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of nano ceramic fiber fillers on the physical properties of VST- 50 HD silicone maxillofacial prosthesis. Nano alumina fibers at 2 percent, 4 -percent, and 6 -percent wt were mixed into the VST- 50 HD silicone elastomer (Factor II Inc., Lakeside, AZ), a commercially-available poly(dimethylsiloxanes). Ten dumb-bell-shaped specimens were used to determine the tensile strength according to ISO 37 : 2005 and elongation at fracture. Ten trouser-shaped test pieces were used to determine the tear resistance according to ISO 34 - 1 : 2004. <b>Shore</b> A test <b>method</b> was used to measure the hardness of the material. The data collected from all quantitative studies of the modified silicones were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with concentration of nano ceramic fiber as the main variable. Specimens from VST- 50 HD were also made and tested as control. Results: The mean values for tensile strength (MPa) of control group, 2 -percent, 4 -percent, and 6 -percent reinforced nano ceramic fiber fillers were from 3. 43 ± 0. 12 to 5. 48 ± 0. 71. Tear strength (MPa) were from 2. 34 ± 0. 37 to 5. 01 ± 0. 39. Elongations at fracture were from 699. 66 ± 43. 69 to 793. 51 ± 57. 27. Shore A hardness were from 25. 76 ± 2. 18 to 38. 76 ± 1. 83. Conclusion: There was a significant difference (p 0. 05) between 2 -percent, 4 -percent, and 6 -percent reinforced nano ceramic fiber fillers. There was a significant difference (p 0. 05) between control group, 4 -percent, and 6 -percent reinforced nano ceramic fiber fillers. The properties of the experiment were all lower than the control. Further research is needed to determine the appropriate material and amount of dispersing agent, coupling agent, and determination of the hydprophilicity of the nano ceramic fiber fillers with great emphasis on the dispersing agent...|$|R
40|$|Different {{strains of}} rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), Ten Sleep, Sand Creek, Beitey, Shepherd-of-the-Hills, New Zealand, Fish Lake- Desmet, Desmet, were {{compared}} for survival to the creel, growth and catchability after being stocked in a fluctuating 80 ha Utah reservoir. Fish were stocked {{in the spring}} and fall as fingerlings and monitored by creel censusing, gill netting and electrofishing. Fish were tagged with coded wire snout tags prior to stocking. An angler opinion survey was conducted to determine angler satisfaction with numbers and size of fish caught. Regardless of strain, spring stocking was superior to fall stocking in survival to the creel. In the spring 78 stocking the Ten Sleep strain had the highest survival to the creel (33. 7 percent), followed in order by Shepherd-of-the-Hills (11. 0 percent), Beitey (5. 5 percent), Sand Creek (5. 4 percent), New Zealand (4. 1 percent), and Fish Lake-Desmet (2. 9 percent). In the spring 79 stocking the Shepherd-of-the- Hills strain had the highest survival to the creel (7. 6 percent), followed in order by the Sand Creek (7. 3 percent) and the Ten Sleep (6. 5 percent). Similar trends in survival were found in gill netting and electrofishing samples. Migration out of the reservoir was negligible for each strain. There were no strain differences in catchability by different <b>methods</b> (<b>shore,</b> boat) or gear (bait, artificial lure). Differences in growth between the fastest growing strains (Ten Sleep, Sand Creek) and the slowest growing strains (New Zealand, Fish Lake-Desmet) averaged as great as 16 mm in length and 43 g in weight. Differences in growth and survival among strains were great enough to span the range of angler satisfaction with numbers caught and size of fish caught from satisfactory to unsatisfactory. Therefore, strain selection can be a useful tool to improve fingerling stocking programs and manipulate the number of anglers who are satisfied with the angling experience...|$|R
