40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Chainsaw users value cutting {{performance}} and safety. Knowledge {{of the forces}} exerted during sawing are necessary to understand and improve the cutting performance of <b>saw</b> <b>chain.</b> Additionally, cutting forces {{can be used to}} form metrics for evaluating performance tradeoffs when using a safety (i. e. low-kickback) <b>saw</b> <b>chain</b> versus a standard chain. The presented work investigates material and operational parameters influencing cutting forces through construction of a custom test stand and analysis using multiple linear regression. The experimental techniques are then applied in a comparison study of several commercially available low-kickback and non-low-kickback saw chains. Test methods were formed that successfully account for variations in workpiece physical properties (moisture content and density) as well as an observed cutting overload phenomenon. Maximum cut-ting efficiency was found to be governed by an operational parameter defined as the overload depth-of cut. Additionally, important interactions were observed be-tween depth-of-cut with both workpiece moisture content and density. Three different low-kickback saw chains were compared to a non-low-kickback <b>saw</b> <b>chain</b> in both nose-clear down bucking and boring cutting modes. In down bucking, the best performing low-kickback <b>saw</b> <b>chain</b> had negligible differences in cutting forces compared to the non-low-kickback <b>saw</b> <b>chain.</b> In the boring cutting mode, professional <b>saw</b> <b>chain</b> had distinctly reduced operator effort (i. e. feed force) and greater cutting efficiency than the low-kickback chains.

Neverthless, as cutter of <b>saw</b> <b>chain</b> is of pecular shape and presents complicated cutting mechanism, investigation about <b>saw</b> <b>chain</b> has scarcely been developed. The purpose {{of this research was}} to measure the cutting force and investigate the cutting mechanism as the first step for the synthetic study about chain sawing machine and <b>saw</b> <b>chain.</b> The experiment consisted of three parts Experiment (1) was the measuring of cutting force while the chain sawing machine being drived and wood specimen being cut through. Experiment (2) was that in order to know the situation of cutting in single cutter, cutting force was measured using the cutter which was restricted from rotation itself being fixed to the rneasuring apparatus. Experiment (3) was that in order to observe the rotation of cutter, cutting force in single cutter of the actual <b>saw</b> <b>chain</b> was measured and scene of the cutter motion was taken in photogragh. This report gives us the summary of cutting characteristics of <b>saw</b> <b>chain</b> which was made clear though the experiments and we can recognize that many problems for further discussion exist in <b>saw</b> <b>chain.</b> They are summarized as follows : (a) As the relation between cutting and chip formation is special the problem of chip formation and number of cutter which will take part in actual cutting must be investigated. (b) Theãresearch for the reason based on the suitable chain tension is expected by means of cutting force theory. (c) The problem about rotation of chain link which causes the vibration and changing of cutting force is very inportant, and the study of tooth shape also must be examined. Moreover, it is previous question that we grasp the relation between cutting force and the change of the rake angle caused by inclination of cutter.

40|$|This paper aims {{to report}} on the cutting {{characteristics}} in more details, in connection with our previous research which was made with the fixed single blade of a <b>saw</b> <b>chain,</b> imposing restriction on its rotation. (a) The variation of the cutting force is not rectilineal with the exception of its vertical component. As the amount of cutting increases, the cutting force value increases by degrees within the depth of approximately 0. 8 millimeters, and then it gains a great deal but beyond 2. 0 millimeters returns to a steady increase. The vertical force has a rectilineal variation, tending to decrease inãproportion to depth. All this while, we observed some minus force working, and this may be the reason why the vertical force decreases. ï¼bï¼ The degree of the rake angle being lessened, the cutting force value increases gently attended with a lineal variation. In this case it must be considered that the change of the rake angle is brought about by the inclination of the blade itself, but that it has no effect on its tool angle. (c) The shape of the chips shows that the increasing amount of cutting and the lessening of the rake angle brings about a similar result in cutting wooden pieces. ï¼dï¼ The two-dimentional cutting by the top plate of a blade explains the fundamental cutting behaviour similar that of the standard cutting shown in ï¼aï¼...|$|E
