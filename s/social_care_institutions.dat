In Ukraine, public opinion did not contribute to the protection of citizens against possible recurrence of political abuse of psychiatry. There were no demonstrations and rallies in support of the mental health law. But there was a public campaign against developing the civilized law and against liberalizing the provision of psychiatric care in the country. The campaign was initiated and conducted by relatives of psychiatric patients. They wrote to newspapers, yelled in busy places and around them, behaved in the unbridled way in ministerial offices and corridors. Once Gluzman saw through a trolleybus window a group of 20-30 people standing by a window of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine with red flags, portraits of Lenin and Stalin and the slogan coarsely written on the white cardboard: [...] "Get the Gluzman psychiatry off Ukraine!" [...] Activists of the dissident movement far from the nostalgia for the past also participated in the actions against changes in the mental health system. But in general, it should be remembered that all these protest actions have been activated by nomenklatura psychiatrists. The whole Ukrainian psychiatric system actually consists of the two units: hospital for treatment of acute psychiatric conditions and internat-hospice for helpless [...] "chronic patients" [...] unable to live on their own. And between hospital and internat-hospice is desert. That is why about 40 percent of patients in any Ukrainian psychiatric hospital are so-called social patients whose stay in the psychiatric hospital is not due to medical indications. A similar pattern is in internats. A significant part of their lifelong customers could have lived long enough in society despite their mental illnesses. They could have lived quite comfortably and safely for themselves and others in special dorms, nursing homes, [...] "halfway houses". Ukraine does not have anything like that.|$|E

Contemporary world trends in care for people with mental disability prefer to class employment opportunities into the area of educational occupation in <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions.</b> The problem of employment {{is one of the}} most serious questions regarding people with mental disability. A fulfillment on a labor market influences several factors in their lives. It is not only the economic situation and social statute but also self-realization. There are several forms of occupational and social fulfillment for people who are disadvantaged on labor market. These are supported employment, protected jobs or protected workshops.

From the point of view of residential structure in Rokycany region it seems to be clear that the region itself has to play a big role so that the services would be provided even in small municipalities, and distant urban areas of the region. The above remarks confirm the hypothesis: 1. Social hospitalization in a health <b>care</b> <b>institution</b> results in insufficient facilities of places in retirement homes and in residence <b>institutions</b> of <b>social</b> <b>care.</b> I propose to improve the organiation of <b>social</b> and health <b>care</b> services for old and handicapped people in SO ORP Rokycany region, which I can regard as an availability of <b>social</b> and health <b>care</b> services in the whole region, as an icrease and enlargement of the social services mainly in non-governmental and nonprofitable sector, and as an increase of the quality of provided social services. The range of social hospitalization in Rokycany hospital, Corp., conditions was investigated within the practical part of my thesis. Both aims were fulfilled by working up the practical part of the thesis, and by carrying out the social demographic analysis. By observing the basic data and information while observing the <b>social</b> <b>care</b> in the health <b>care</b> <b>institution,</b> it definitely bears to the hypothesi 2. : The refund of social hospitalization doesnt include the costs of sickbed in a health <b>care</b> <b>institution,</b> which is contributing tounfavourable economical situation in a health <b>care</b> <b>institution.</b> The new law doesnt solve this problem of financing the social sickbeds.

This results in repeated and longtime peoples hospitalization,who are being given this health care allowance. I think it is necessary to ammend the accepted law 108 / 2006, of Law Digest, abot social services. The matter of finance of longtime hospitalization in health <b>care</b> <b>institution</b> could be solved by the items up increase for longtime lying people.

We aimed to identify the key components of institutional care for people with longer term mental health problems {{and the effectiveness of}} these components. Methods: We undertook a systematic review of the literature using comprehensive search terms in 11 electronic databases and identified 12, 182 titles. We viewed 550 abstracts, reviewed 223 papers and included 110 of these. A "critical interpretative synthesis" of the evidence was used to identify domains of institutional care that are key to service users' recovery. Results: We identified eight domains of institutional care that were key to service users' recovery: living conditions; interventions for schizophrenia; physical health; restraint and seclusion; staff training and support; therapeutic relationship; autonomy and service user involvement; and clinical governance. Evidence was strongest for specific interventions for the treatment of schizophrenia (family psychoeducation, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and vocational rehabilitation). Conclusion: Institutions should, ideally, be community based, operate a flexible regime, maintain a low density of residents and maximise residents' privacy. For service users with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, specific interventions (CBT, family interventions involving psychoeducation, and supported employment) should be provided through integrated programmes. Restraint and seclusion should be avoided wherever possible and staff should have adequate training in de-escalation techniques. Regular staff supervision should be provided and this should support service user involvement in decision making and positive therapeutic relationships between staff and service users.

40|$|ABSTRACT The use {{of animals}} as mans helpers or companions {{is as old}} as {{domestication}} itself. Contact with an animal, if accepted positively by the person, relaxes, slows down heartbeat and lowers blood pressure, releases tension, intermediates communication, compensates for missing abilities of people. Canistherapy as a supporting rehabilitation method contributes to the relaxation of muscle spasms, development of fine and gross motor skills, stimulates verbal and non-verbal communication, orientation in space, enhances motivation to participate in ones own healing process, and improves the clients interaction with other clients and nurses. The theoretical part of the Bachelor thesis is dedicated to the definition of canistherapy within comprehensive rehabilitation of people with a motor apparatus disability. Particular attention is paid to the issue of individuals affected by cerebral palsy and achondroplasia. The goal of the Bachelor thesis is to determine the influence of a dog-assisted therapy on people with a motor apparatus disability. A partial goal is to define the standing and position of a dog-assisted therapy within integral comprehensive rehabilitation of the client.

We chose families with a new born baby because birth situations put at stake family roles and the links between families and institutions are reinforced at children’s birth. According to our first results, the major differences between the family types involve the form of parenthood: more or less reflective, authoritarian or negotiated relationships, more or less linked to gender.

The target group of this institution are senior citizens, who are becoming an ever more significant group needing social assistance. They {{do not want to be}} excluded from the company of their peers. They want to live dignified and full lives even in this stage of their lifetimes. Therefore, compliance with care quality standards, especially in relation to senior citizens in residential establishments, is very important aspect of provision of high-quality social services. In the theoretical part, I define the basic concepts in the field of social services and focus on the Act on Social Services and the subsequently ensuing quality standards for social services and inspection of social service provision to deal with them in greater width. The objective of the paper was to establish whether the selected standards in relation to the clients, but also in relation to their relatives, are complied with. Two hypotheses were defined. To achieve the objectives of this bachelor's paper and to verify the hypotheses defined, quantitative research was chosen in the theoretical part. Data collection was performed using the interview method, by controlled interview technique for the clients, and by questionnaire technique for their relatives. Document analysis, a secondary data analysis technique, was used as an auxiliary method. Having processed the research part and made its subsequent evaluation, I believe that the quality standards are being complied with in the senior citizens' home of the BLANKA Centre, both in relation to the clients and in relation to their relatives. Although you may infer from the results achieved that the standards are fulfilled and complied with in the senior citizens' home, it is important to point out that evaluation of quality standards does not mean mere monitoring of fulfilment of the individual quality standards and the methodologies elaborated from them. It is a long-term, continuously developing and changing process, in which mutually suitable possibilities have to be sought both by the users and by the provider in order to respect the individualities of the users, their rights and needs...|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} concept of gender {{mainstreaming}} based on Lithuanian and EU documents and scientific literature. Gender mainstreaming concentrates main attention towards both problems {{of men and}} women in their private and public lives. For the equity between men and women to become reality it is an imperative not only to solve specific problems {{of men and women}}, but also to understand them as complex issues incorporated in reallife situations. This practically can be achieved through consistent integration of gender aspects into legal documents, programmes and policies related to institutions active in society. In order to accomplish gender mainstreaming two elements are of key importance – adequate and relevant understanding of strategy and specific methods of gender aspect integration in public institution practices. Two methods for the integration of gender mainstreaming in <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> at the municipal level and for direct social work practice are represented and discussed. Remiantis Lietuvos ir ES dokumentais bei moksline literatūra, straipsnyje atskleidžiama lyčių aspekto integravimo strategijos (angl. gender mainstreaming) samprata bei pateikiami lyčių lygybės perspektyvą integruojantys metodai socialinės apsaugos institucijose savivaldybių lygmenyje bei tiesioginiame socialiniame darbe su klientais...|$|E
40|$|The {{conjunction}} of wireless computing, ubiquitous Internet access, and the miniaturisation of sensors {{have opened the}} door for technological applications that can monitor health and well-being outside of formal healthcare systems. The health-related Internet of Things (H-IoT) increasingly {{plays a key role in}} health management by providing real-time tele-monitoring of patients, testing of treatments, actuation of medical devices, and fitness and well-being monitoring. Given its numerous applications and proposed benefits, adoption by medical and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> and consumers may be rapid. However, a host of ethical concerns are also raised that must be addressed. The inherent sensitivity of health-related data being generated and latent risks of Internet-enabled devices pose serious challenges. Users, already in a vulnerable position as patients, face a seemingly impossible task to retain control over their data due to the scale, scope and complexity of systems that create, aggregate, and analyse personal health data. In response, the H-IoT must be designed to be technologically robust and scientifically reliable, while also remaining ethically responsible, trustworthy, and respectful of user rights and interests. To assist developers of the H-IoT, this paper describes nine principles and nine guidelines for ethical design of H-IoT devices and data protocols...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} {{between the state and the}} Catholic Church during the years 1948 - 1989 and its impact on women's religious orders, namely the Union Order of St. Ursula, whose members in 1950 have been victims of internment and as a result of the centralization of the state in the event "Ř". Specific stories of six nuns documented the conditions in which the Order was forced to survive in a time when the activities of all religious orders were prohibited. The persecution of nuns were forced to work in agriculture, industry, and later also worked in psychiatric hospitals and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions.</b> The authentic experiences of survivors help us not only to reconstruct the sequence of historical events, but also give us nuns personal views on this difficult period, during which, regardless of circumstances, they managed to maintain their inner freedom. Individual narrative report in view of the time they experienced mostly match, but we find little differences. The aim of this work is to find continuity in the experiences, to understand and learn the motivations behind the positions of the narrators and on this basis to achieve at least partial conclusions.

40|$|Since {{the nineteenth}} century historians {{developed}} models on the contradiction between the economy of profit and the economy of care. Nowadays it seems inconsistent. Thus, we can study the role of some Italian hospitals in the credit management. It is not relevant, whether they were funded or renewed since the thirteenth century We try to relate them to the “Monti”. They are structures funded since {{the second half of}} the fifteenth century relating each other credit and <b>social</b> <b>care.</b> Soon after, further enterprises aiming to organise and manage the <b>social</b> <b>care</b> in a profitable way spread rapidly. Santa Maria della Scala is a case study. The “Siena-system” shows a bank-town and an enterprise-hospital. The latter had a major role within the business. A comparison at a European scale has been made. It shows that several <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> of the late middle ages invested in the financial market of the towns...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examined}} how {{the relationship between}} emotions and work, present in the discourses about <b>social</b> <b>care,</b> configure the meaning of aging for professionals in this area in a Long Term <b>Care</b> <b>Institution</b> for Elders. The contextualist approach of studies of emotions was theoretically articulated intertwined {{with the process of}} subjective constitution of the social workers. In order to collect the data a documental research was provided by the institution, and semi-structured interviews with the social workers were carried out, two interns of the professional segment and four elderly residents of the institution. The results demonstrated a polarization between two hegemonic models of understanding of old age, in which emotional engagement acts as the subjective sphere that allows the objectification of this process of social cleavage. Through the analysis of emotional engagement in the <b>social</b> <b>care</b> work activities, we identified organizational practices that confirm the model of impoverishment and neglect of older people in society...|$|R
