5000|$|A magnetic-coded lock is a lock {{device that}} uses pins in {{combination}} with magnets to prevent entry by either non-matching keys by teething or magnetic polarity. Magnetic-coded <b>locks</b> encompass <b>knob</b> <b>locks,</b> cylinder locks, lever locks, and deadbolt locks as well as applications in other security devices.|$|R
50|$|Through {{the latter}} half of the nineteenth century the company grew. The firm {{manufactured}} builders’ hardware including coat and hat hooks, sash fasteners, picture nails, <b>locks,</b> <b>knobs,</b> as well as coffin trimmings. Beginning in early 1870 the company switched its focus to decorative hardware. Many prominent buildings from Boston to Philadelphia, including the Connecticut State Capitol in Hartford are outfitted with Corbin decorative hardware.|$|R

50|$|As {{described}} above, the Caps Lock behaviour in most QWERTY keyboard layouts {{differs from}} the <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> behaviour in that it capitalizes letters but does not affect other keys, such as numbers or punctuation. Some early computer keyboards, such as the Commodore 64, had a <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> but no Caps Lock; others, such as the BBC Micro, had both, only one {{of which could be}} enabled at a time.|$|R

5000|$|There was {{at least}} one point in which Archy {{happened}} to jump onto the <b>shift</b> <b>lock</b> key — a chapter titled [...] "Capitals at Last" [...] (styled as [...] "CAPITALS AT LAST").|$|R
50|$|The <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key was {{introduced}} so the shift operation could be maintained indefinitely without continuous effort. It mechanically locked the typebars in the shifted position, causing the upper character to be typed upon pressing any key. Because the two shift keys on a typewriter required more force to operate and {{were meant to}} be pressed by the little finger, it could be difficult to hold the shift down for {{more than two or three}} consecutive strokes, therefore the introduction of the <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key was also meant to reduce finger muscle pain caused by repetitive typing.|$|R
50|$|Automatic Transmission <b>shift</b> <b>lock</b> was {{mechanism}} {{instead of}} an electrical control, a unique method that deregulation was mechanically wire extending from the brake pedal. This was also {{the advantage of being}} unaffected by the battery.|$|R
50|$|Mindset had dual {{front-mounted}} ROM cartridge ports with a <b>locking</b> <b>knob</b> on {{the left}} side of the main computer module to lock the ROM modules into place. The Mindset had the option (through its System Configuration Utility) to be able to select whether the system booted from left or right ROM carts, or disk drive. Cartridges could also contain CMOS RAM, which would be retained when unplugged by a battery in the cartridge case. Cartridges were envisioned to be a primary medium for software distribution on the Mindset, but sales of the system were too low for cartridges to be economical, and software was distributed on disk instead.|$|R
50|$|In some {{keyboard}} layouts, {{the status}} of the Caps Lock key only changes the meaning of the alphabet keys (verbatim as per capital <b>shift</b> <b>lock),</b> not that of the number row, which then still requires the Shift key to be pressed to reach the alternative key definitions.|$|R
50|$|A {{version of}} Caps Lock that behaves like a {{traditional}} <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> does exist on certain layouts {{such as the}} French AZERTY. Some operating systems and window managers allow Caps Lock {{to be used for}} a similar function. This behavior of the Caps Lock survives, however, in German and Austrian QWERTZ keyboards.|$|R
50|$|A key {{providing}} one of {{the functions}} Capitals lock (usually called “Caps Lock”), Level 2 lock (i. e. “Shift lock”), or Generalized lock shall be present, occupying the position C00. (The function “Generalized lock” is not specified in the ISO/IEC 9995 series). It is to {{be noted that the}} specific way the Caps <b>Lock</b> or <b>Shift</b> <b>Lock</b> works (i. e. swapping the lock state by hitting the key, as it is usually implemented) is not specified in the ISO/IEC 9995 series. Thus, solutions avoiding the status dependency as well as the problem of inadvertent hitting (e.g., the lock key pressed together with <b>Shift</b> turns <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> on, together with AltGr turns Caps Lock on, pressed alone switches off any lock status but has no effect when no lock status is activated) would not prevent compliance to the standard.|$|R
50|$|While {{the typical}} locking {{behaviour}} on keyboards with Caps Lock key {{is that of}} a toggle, each press reversing the shift state, some keyboard layouts implement a combi mode, where pressing a Shift key in Caps Lock mode will also release the Caps Lock mode, just as it typically happens in <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> mode.|$|R
50|$|Caps Lock is {{a button}} on a {{computer}} keyboard that, when pressed, causes all letters to be generated in capitals until deactivated. It {{is located in the}} position of a similar <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key (and sometimes a Ctrl key) found in some other keyboard layouts. It is usually a toggle key: each press reverses its action.|$|R
50|$|This input {{is used to}} {{determine}} whether to activate the <b>shift</b> <b>lock</b> solenoid to prevent the driver selecting a driving range with no foot on the brake. In more modern TCUs this input is also used {{to determine}} whether to downshift the transmission to increase engine braking effect if the transmission detects that the vehicle is going downhill.|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} {{technique for}} phase noise improvement in a fractional-N synthesizer is described. The method requires using in a 90 " phase <b>shift</b> <b>lock</b> a non-linear continuous-time or sampled-data block before the loop filter. Behavioral simulations on a fractional-N synthesizer incorporating different non-linear blocks and a second-order single bit sigma delta modulator {{show that it}} is possible to achieve phase noise improvements at medium frequency as good as 17 dB. 1...|$|R
2500|$|The mansion's {{exterior}} {{included many}} turrets and minarets, {{and on the}} interior, a spiral staircase without a center support, rising [...] into the central [...] tower. Two elevators also served the building. The Palmers constructed their mansion's outside doors specifically without <b>locks</b> and <b>knobs</b> so {{that the only way}} to get in was to be admitted from the inside.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Jazzmaster, the floating tremolo was used on the then top-of-the-line Fender Jaguar guitars, released in 1962, and also on the Fender Bass VI, released in 1961. Jaguar and Jazzmasters share the same bridge plate and string saddles, though Jaguar bridges (and the earliest Jazzmaster bridges) have taller [...] "legs". The two are functionally interchangeable and replacement parts for each {{are one and the}} same. The Bass VI bridge has a wider plate and longer intonation screws to allow the bass strings to be correctly intonated, and the saddles have threads cut for larger diameter strings. There have also been a small number of not very notable imitations by other makers, generally without the <b>locking</b> <b>knob.</b> Fender discontinued all floating tremolo models by 1980, but reintroduced both the Jazzmaster and Jaguar first as Japanese models in the mid 1980s, then as American-made reissues in the 1990s. The tremolo-equipped Bass VI was reintroduced as a US Custom Shop model in 2006.|$|R
50|$|The first {{developments}} {{took place}} around {{the junction of}} the Rash Behari Connector and the E.M. Bypass - the Kasba Golpark area. Ruby Hospital, the office of Siemens {{and a host of}} government-sponsored housing complexes came up in the area. Then the Meghalaya House <b>shifted</b> <b>lock,</b> stock and barrel to this growth region from their old premises at Russel Street, huge amounts of money began pouring into real-estate activities and this resulted in feverish construction activity all along the stretch of the Rash Behari Connector.|$|R
5000|$|For example, in most {{keyboard}} layouts the Shift {{key combination}} [...] {{will produce a}} capital letter [...] "A" [...] instead of the default lower-case letter [...] "a" [...] (unless in Caps <b>lock</b> or <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> mode). A combination of [...] in Microsoft Windows will close the program in the active window; in this instance, Alt is the modifier key. In contrast, pressing just [...] or [...] will probably do nothing unless assigned a specific function in a particular program (for example, activating input aids or the toolbar of the active window in Windows).|$|R

In February 1988 {{there was an}} {{improved}} and some 20 releases Super medalist anniversary special edition. In May 1988, the [...] "Hawaii Touring" [...] model was released. In September of the same year, the Super Series Selection {{was added to the}} lineup. In December discontinued captive model. In January 1989 Laurels with an automatic gearbox received a <b>shift</b> <b>lock.</b> The fifth generation was discontinued in July 1993.|$|R
2500|$|Because of {{the high}} {{centrifugal}} forces encountered during drifting, drivers are usually retained by a racing seat and five-point harness. This allows the hands to merely turn the wheel, instead of bracing {{the body in the}} seat. The same applies for the feet, which are free to move rapidly between clutch, brake and accelerator pedals. The steering wheel is usually relatively small, dished, and perfectly round, {{so that it can be}} released and allowed to spin through the hands as the caster returns the front wheels to center. The <b>locking</b> <b>knob</b> on the hand brake is usually replaced with a spin turn knob; this stops the hand brake locking on when pulled. Nearly all drivers move the hand brake location or add an extra hydraulic hand brake actuator for greater braking force. Additional gauges used to monitor boost levels, oil pressure and temperature, intake and coolant temperatures, air-fuel ratio (also called λ, or [...] "lambda" [...] ratio), etc. Some drivers, especially in larger cars, move the seating position for a better weight distribution, such as Daigo Saito's 2014 JZX100 Mk.II Chaser.|$|R
50|$|The Caps Lock key {{originated}} as a <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key on mechanical typewriters. An early {{innovation in}} typewriters was {{the introduction of}} a second character on each typebar, thereby doubling the number of characters that could be typed, using the same number of keys. The second character was positioned above the first on the face of each typebar, and the shift key caused the entire type apparatus to move, physically shifting the positioning of the typebars relative to the ink ribbon. Just as in modern computer keyboards, the shifted position was used to produce capitals and secondary characters.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of the few}} C64 {{programs}} that fail on a C128 will run correctly when the CAPS LOCK key is pressed down (or the ASCII/National key on international C128 models). This {{has to do with}} the larger built-in I/O port of the C128's CPU. Whereas the <b>SHIFT</b> <b>LOCK</b> key found on both C64 and C128 is simply a mechanical latch for the left SHIFT key, the CAPS LOCK key on the C128 can be read via the 8502's built-in I/O port. A few C64 programs are confused by this extra I/O bit; keeping the CAPS LOCK key in the down position will force the I/O line low, matching the C64's configuration and resolving the issue.|$|R
50|$|The {{interiors}} {{generally are}} notable for early cedar joinery and early door and window hardware including door <b>knobs,</b> <b>locks,</b> drop bolts, porcelain finger plates and key plates, and brass door handles to inner entrance doors. There is a gaslight fitting {{to the left}} of the vault opening.|$|R
50|$|There's no {{specific}} <b>Locking</b> <b>Shift</b> Character Set for the Spanish language. Uses the default Basic Character Set.|$|R
40|$|A {{device for}} {{attaching}} an experiment carrier to {{a space station}} handrail is provided. The device has two major components, a clamping mechanism for attachment to a space station handrail, and a pointing carrier on which an experiment package can be mounted and oriented. The handrail clamp uses an overcenter mechanism and the carrier mechanism uses an adjustable preload ball and socket for carrier positioning. The handrail clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a spring loaded button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible handrail thicknesses. Three load points are incorporated in the clamping mechanism thereby spreading the clamping load onto three separate points on the handrail. A four bar linkage is used to provide for a single actuation lever for all three load points. For additional safety, a secondary lock consisting of a capture plate and push lock keeps the clamp attached to the handrail {{in the event of}} main clamp failure. For the carrier positioning mechanism, a ball in a spring loaded socket uses friction to provide locking torque; however. the ball and socket are torque limited so that the ball ran slip under kick loads (125 pounds or greater). A lead screw attached to disk spring stacks is used to provide an adjustable spring force on the socket. A <b>locking</b> <b>knob</b> is attached to the lead screw to allow for hand manipulation of the lead screw...|$|R
50|$|Braille (a {{writing system}} for the blind) uses either 6 or 8 tactile 'points' from which all letters and numbers are formed. When Louis Braille invented it, it was {{produced}} with a needle holing successively all needed points in a cardboard sheet. In 1892, Frank Haven Hall, superintendent of the Illinois Institute for the Education of the Blind, created the Hall Braille Writer, which was like a typewriter with 6 keys, one for each dot in a braille cell. The Perkins Brailler, first manufactured in 1951, uses a 6-key chord keyboard (plus a spacebar) to produce braille output, and has been very successful as a mass market affordable product. Braille, like Baudot, uses a number symbol and a shift symbol, which may be repeated for <b>shift</b> <b>lock,</b> to fit numbers and upper case into the 63 codes that 6 bits offer.|$|R
50|$|Like the Prevé, the Suprima S {{has also}} been {{developed}} to house a maximum of 6 SRS airbags, an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA), Traction Control (TCS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESC). However, unlike the Prevé, all Suprima units came standard {{with all of its}} engineered safety features at launch, whereas the MDM Prevé Premium trim was only offered with a maximum of 4 airbags with all electronic safety equipment, and the MDM Prevé Executive trim models were only fitted with 2 airbags without BA, TCS & ESC at launch. However, the MDM Prevé has since been updated for the 2014 model year and currently offers all of its engineered safety features as standard across all trim variants, without a hike in pricing. Additionally, the Suprima Premium variant offers front parking sensors, a reverse camera, Hill-Hold Assist, an Electronic Gear <b>Shift</b> <b>Lock</b> and brighter LED daytime running lights (DRL) which help contribute to an overall increase in safety standards.|$|R
6000|$|Therefore, in {{allotting}} expenses, {{set this}} {{down as a}} must-be: [...] "Our house must have fresh air,--everywhere, at all times, winter and summer." [...] Whether we have stone facings or no; whether our parlor has cornices or marble mantles or no; whether our doors are machine-made or hand-made. All our fixtures shall be of the plainest and simplest, but we will have fresh air. We will open our door with a latch and string, if we cannot afford <b>lock</b> and <b>knob</b> and fresh air too; but in our house we will live cleanly and Christianly. We will no more breathe the foul air rejected from a neighbor's lungs than we will use a neighbor's tooth-brush and hair-brush. Such is the first essential of [...] "our house,"--the first great element of human health and happiness,--AIR.|$|R
500|$|The United Auto Workers (UAW) {{was founded}} in Detroit on August 26, 1935. The labor union {{struggled}} to gain members until the Flint Sit-Down Strike in 1937. The strike started on December 30, 1936, when workers at the Fisher Body Plant No.1 stopped loading tool dies on the night <b>shift,</b> <b>locking</b> themselves into the plant. The dies were destined for shipment to plants where union activity was much weaker than the UAW-organized plants in Flint. [...] On January 3, 1937, workers at the plant {{sat down on the}} job; Fisher Plant No.2 later joined in the sit-down strike. The heat was shut off at the plants, and on January 11, food deliveries were stopped, sparking a riot. Governor Frank Murphy mobilized 4,000National Guard troops to keep peace at the plants. A second riot occurred at Chevrolet Plant No.4 on February 1. The National Guard troops surrounded the 12striking plants in Flint, but the governor never ordered them into action. President Franklin D. Roosevelt encouraged the two parties to sit down once more, and an agreement was signed, recognizing the UAW in the 17 striking plants across the country.|$|R
50|$|Along {{the course}} of the canal there are 16 locks with lifting heights of up to 25 m. The 16 locks are managed from four remote control centres (Neuses since 2007, Kriegenbrunn, Hilpoltstein, and Dietfurt from the {{beginning}} of 2007). These centres are manned with one worker on the night shift, and two on the day <b>shift.</b> The <b>locks</b> were modernized from 2001 to 2007, replacing the outdated relay technology with computers and a PLC. The cost was approximately $ 1.3 million per lock.|$|R
