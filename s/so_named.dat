The other lakes are Laguna Cari Launa on the Chilean side in the northeastern sector of the field, and Laguna Fea in the south and Laguna Negra lake both on the Argentine side.

5|$|There are two distinct, though connected, {{regions of}} ER that differ in {{structure}} and function: smooth ER and rough ER. The {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} is <b>so</b> <b>named</b> because the cytoplasmic surface is covered with ribosomes, giving it a bumpy appearance when viewed through an electron microscope. The smooth ER appears smooth since its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|A {{slightly}} broader definition {{used by the}} Office for National Statistics (ONS) includes developed areas adjoining Bristol {{but outside}} the city-council boundary, such as Whitchurch village, Filton, Patchway and Bradley Stoke, but excludes undeveloped areas within that boundary. The ONS has defined a Bristol Urban Area, which includes Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Stoke Gifford, Winterbourne, Frampton Cotterell, Almondsbury and Easton in Gordano.

5|$|Because of {{morphological}} similarities, the Sumatran rhinoceros {{is believed}} to be closely related to the extinct woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). The woolly rhinoceros, <b>so</b> <b>named</b> for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros, first appeared in China; by the Upper Pleistocene, it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain. The woolly rhinoceros survived the last Ice Age, but, like the woolly mammoth, most or all became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Although some morphological studies questioned the relationship, recent molecular analysis has supported the two species as sister taxa.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145Â° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is <b>so</b> <b>named</b> because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E

Popular attractions along this portion include Negro Bill Canyon, with hiking trails to Morning Glory Arch, campgrounds and boat docks at a curve in the river called Big Bend.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-based blue {{pigments}} (cobalt blue) {{have been}} used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists {{to be due to}} the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were <b>so</b> <b>named</b> because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.|$|E

5|$|Ghats (stone steps laid on {{a gradual}} bank slope to descend {{to the lake}} edge) at Pushkar are {{integral}} to the lake. Ghats are also used for sacred bathing and rites, such as ancestor worship. Out of 52 ghats used by pilgrims to take a holy bath in the lake, ten important ghats {{on the periphery of}} the lake, which have other contiguous ghats adjoining them, have also been declared as 'Monuments of National Importance'. These ghats are: the Varaha Ghat, the Dadhich Ghat, Saptarishi Ghats, Gwalior Ghat, Kota Ghat, Gau ghat, Yag Ghat, Jaipur Ghat, Karni Ghat and Gangaur Ghat. These ghats as well as the sacred Pushkar Lake (which is also a declared heritage monument) have been refurbished over the centuries by the Royal families of Rajasthan and by the Maratha kings. These are now undergoing further works as part of a heritage improvement programme launched with funds provided by the Government of Rajasthan and several departments of the Government of India. There are strict codes to be followed while taking a bath in the ghats, such as removing shoes away from the ghats and avoiding the passing of unwarranted comments about Hindu religious beliefs by non-Hindus, since the ghats and the temples are linked to the divine lake. The sacred water of the lake is said to be curative of many skin diseases. Local belief is that water around each ghat has a special curative power. While many ghats have been named after the Rajas who built them, some ghats have particular importance. Varaha ghat is <b>so</b> <b>named</b> since Vishnu appeared here in his incarnation of a boar (Varaha). Brahma Ghat is <b>so</b> <b>named</b> since Brahma bathed here. The Gau Ghat was renamed as Gandhi Ghat after Mahatma Gandhi's ashes were immersed at this ghat. Nart Singh Ghat, close to Varaha Ghat, has a stuffed crocodile on display.|$|E

Solitaire lies to Mr Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr Big decides to release Bond and Leiter, and has one of Bond's fingers broken. On leaving, Bond kills several of Mr Big's men, while Leiter is released with minimal physical harm by a gang member, sympathetic because of a shared appreciation of jazz.|$|E
5|$|Myriostoma is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Geastraceae. The genus is monotypic, {{containing}} the single species Myriostoma coliforme. It is an earthstar, <b>so</b> <b>named</b> because the spore-bearing sack's outer wall splits open {{into the shape of}} a star. The inedible fungus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and has been found in Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Europe, where it grows in humus-rich forests or in woodlands, especially on well-drained and sandy soils. A somewhat rare fungus, it appears on the Red Lists of 12 European countries, and in 2004 it was one of 33 species proposed for protection under the Bern Convention by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi.|$|E
