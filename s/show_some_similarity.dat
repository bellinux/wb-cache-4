5|$|The Bronze Age in Scotland {{lasted from}} {{approximately}} 2000 BC to 800 BC. The oldest known {{remains on the}} Jarlshof site date from this period, although {{there is evidence of}} inhabitation as far back as 2500 BC. The remains of several small oval houses with thick stone walls date to the late Bronze Age and the structures <b>show</b> <b>some</b> <b>similarity</b> to Skara Brae on Mainland, Orkney, but are smaller and of a later date. These buildings may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} noted that {{northern}} communities of Kikai are phonologically more conservative and <b>show</b> <b>some</b> <b>similarity</b> to Amami Ōshima and Tokunoshima {{while the rest of}} the island is closer to Southern Amami. For example, Northern Kikai retains seven vowels, /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/, /ɨ/ and /ɘ/ while South-Central Kikai only has five vowels. /k/ is palatalized into /t͡ɕ/ before /i/ in South-Central Kikai but not in Northern Kikai.|$|E

But whether Lamasina {{is in fact a}} close relative of the former is not thoroughly studied. The upperwings of Lamasina males and females are bluish, with broad black margins which are broader in females. The underwings are greenish to brown, with a striped or mottled pattern that distinguishes males from females. In some, the males have blue forewing undersides also.|$|E

Actually the word [...] "shopar" [...] in Bulgarian means [...] "young boar" [...] and {{has nothing to do with}} the Shopi.

50|$|As well as {{houses and}} palaces, he also {{designed}} {{a number of}} churches, such as those at Renswoude and at Hooge Zwaluwe, and the Nieuwe Kerk in Haarlem. Of that design, Pieter Saenredam made no fewer than three paintings and eight engravings. Furthermore, Van Campen designed gates and towers, e.g. for the Westerkerk and Nieuwe Kerk, both in Amsterdam.

50|$|Comparatively recently, a peptide was {{isolated}} from the cockroach Diploptera punctata that showed no similarity to any known insect peptide but did <b>show</b> <b>some</b> <b>similarity</b> to vertebrate calcitonin (Furuya et al., 2000). The D. punctata peptide, subsequently named Dippu-DH31, {{turned out to be}} the first example of a whole new family of insect diuretic peptides - the calcitonin (CT)-like peptides. Dippu-DH31 {{was isolated}} using a cyclic AMP assay at the same time as a CRF-related peptide from the same insect. Ct-like peptides and CRF-related peptides both stimulate cAMP production by isolated tubules, but it is suspected that CT-like peptides target a different cAMP-dependent effector system or activate a different second messenger pathway. CT-like peptides have since been identified in other orders - Diptera, Lepidoptera, and one has been partially sequenced from Hymenoptera. Unpublished studies show immunologically-related peptides in Tenebrio molitor (Coast et al., 2002).|$|E
50|$|The {{buildings}} in the village <b>show</b> <b>some</b> <b>similarity</b> of age and building style commensurate with estate management. This {{can be seen in}} window frames and doors, the use of ironstone and brick building materials with limestone decoration. At the T junction {{to the west of the}} village, set upon a bank, is a terrace of six houses called Sykes Row. The red brick and tiled roof construction with decorative window arches are striking. Ivy House Farm, the Old Barn and Woodbine Cottage are opposite and as the road dips down into the village the church can be glimpsed behind the mature trees that border its north and west walls. As the visitor proceeds along the road such cottages as Primrose, Highfield and Laburnum Cottage grace the sides with their unspoilt red brick and tile construction and well kept gardens. Further along Manor Farm and Glen Farm, working farms, display wonderful building features such as working sash windows. The Manor Farmhouse is Grade II listed. Since 1994 Freeby has been under the protection of the Freeby Conservation Area which covers 3.38 hectares sand was designated by Melton Borough Council. The settlement is relatively unspoilt as an agricultural village, certainly worthy of preservation and its buildings and rural nature are a credit to English heritage. Most of the village, other than some farm buildings, are encompassed in the conservation area.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a summary of}} an {{analysis}} of the ground-effect characteristics of a large-scale twin-engine, tilt-nacelle V/STOL model. The analysis considers data from the flow field beneath the full-scale model, as well as small-scale model test data, and makes comparisons with jet-ground interactions predicted by a computer code. The data from the large-scale test comprise ground-plane surface temperatures, static pressure distribution and wall-jet total-pressure profiles, fuselage undersurface static pressures, and model forces and moments. The results indicate that the near-field flow is more complex than is indicated by either the small-scale uniform jet studies or the computer predictions. The far-field flow characteristics do <b>show</b> <b>some</b> <b>similarity</b> for these three cases...|$|E

40|$|Guillaume Lamy and the {{material}} soul. Guillaume Lamy, author of several medico-philosophical works, defended an epicurean and anti-finalistic philosophy, which led him to reject new medical ideas. His definition of the fiery material soul in his 6 th Discours anatomique was reproduced in several 18 th-century works, but his works {{do not seem to}} have played a vital {{role in the development of}} materialistic thought. Only La Mettrie, who preferred a different explanation of intellectual functions, refers to him. Unlike Willis and Duncan, with whom his ideas <b>show</b> <b>some</b> <b>similarity,</b> Lamy's explanations of the functioning of the brain are theoretical, not based on experimental evidence and thus were ignored by the vitalists.
