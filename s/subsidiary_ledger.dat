50|$|NewViews {{does not}} rely on {{accounting}} modules, as is typical of other accounting software programs. Instead, reporting structure {{is controlled by the}} way accounts are totalled on reports (referred to as report arithmetic). An account can total to another account on the same report, or to an account on any other report. The ability to total an account on one report to an account on another report is the foundation of integration in NewViews. For example, the change to retained earnings on the income statement can be totalled to the retained earnings on the balance sheet to reflect this relationship. Total amounts from <b>subsidiary</b> <b>ledgers</b> and schedules can also be totalled directly to controlling accounts on financial statements or other subsidiary reports. In this way, NewViews can be set up to accommodate standard <b>subsidiary</b> <b>ledgers</b> (e.g. accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory, etc.) as well as highly customized reports that are specific to user needs (e.g. reports required for fund accounting in not-for-profit agencies).|$|R

40|$|This study {{looks at}} the {{hitherto}} unexamined accounting and financial arrangements that undergirded the management of J & P Coats Ltd, one of Britain's largest and most successful multinational companies, from 1890 to 1960. Four elements of Coats' financial systems are scrutinized: consolidation accounting, the control and funding of <b>subsidiaries,</b> private <b>ledgers</b> and, finally, management accounting practices. The contribution of each to detailed organizational control {{and the maintenance of}} secrecy/ confidentiality is analysed. The article concludes that each element contributed substantially to these objectives. The study has implications for the debate on British entrepreneurial failure, in which it is alleged by some writers that Britain's family-owned holding and subsidiary-type companies did not achieve their potential. It makes it clear that Coats was highly successful, in part due to its tight accounting systems and controls. The study opens up the possibility that other examples may be found where successful British businesses based on family capital relied on similar management and accounting controls...|$|R
