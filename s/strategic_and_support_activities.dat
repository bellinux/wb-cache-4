40|$|Abstract — Software {{industry}} is gaining momentum due to {{profound impact on}} the productivity of the various tasks. Typically software development life cycle includes, development activity and post release activities. The post release activities cover software maintenance <b>and</b> <b>support.</b> It is inevitable to deny the significance of software maintenance <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>activities</b> due to fairly a large size of the software. In this study we are analyzing the relationship of team size, application size and software maintenance <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>activities.</b> We used the latest dataset of International Standard Benchmark Group data repository containing the software maintenance <b>and</b> <b>support</b> information to conduct this empirical investigation. The results of this empirical investigation further reinforce the current perceptions of the significantly important role of application size, team structure and size on the software maintenance <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>activities.</b> Index Terms—Software maintenance, Software size, Empirical studie...|$|R
