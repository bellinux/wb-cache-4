We argue that the presence of non-epistemic agendas and severe non-epistemic consequences are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions <b>for</b> <b>EDD</b> to obtain. We clarify their role by arguing that they are contingent enabling factors, not stable difference-makers, in the production of EDD. We maintain that two stable difference-makers are core to the production of EDD: production of skewed science and effective public dissemination...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Eosinophilic {{digestive}} disease (EDD) {{includes a}} broad spectrum of clinical presentations due to eosinophilic inflammation involving anywhere from the esophagus to the rectum. The heterogeneity in the clinical presentations of EDD is determined by the site and depth of eosinophilic infiltration. The sites of inflammation determine the nomenclature <b>for</b> <b>EDD.</b> The most well characterized of these, eosinophilic esophagitis (EE), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG), and eosinophilic colitis or enterocolitis. While the depth of esosinophilic infiltration through the three main layers (mucosa, musculosa and serosa) determines the prominent clinical manifestation. The recent advances in gastrointestinal endoscopy and the increasing awareness and diagnosis of EDD, in my viewpoint, can be of help to add {{to our understanding of the}} heterogeneous clinical syndrome under the broad title bronchial asthma. Here I present my viewpoint that EDD and the allergic bronchial asthma can be regarded as two clinical expressions of one disease in two different but related anatomical systems. </p...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} if the detrimental {{impact of}} year of entering education in preterm infants persists into adolescence. Preterm infants are often enrolled in school {{a year earlier}} than would be expected if this decision is based on their actual date of birth rather than their due date. Initially these infants appear to do disproportionately worse {{than those who do}} not 'skip' a year. However, it is unclear if this effect remains as the infants grow, to have an important effect on long term achievements in education. A cohort study, drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). The exposure measurement was gestational age (defined as preterm (< 37 weeks gestation) or term (37 - 42 weeks)). The primary outcome was a low score at the Key Stage 4 (KS 4) educational assessment or receiving special educational needs support (both at age 16). We derived conditional regression models matching preterm to term infants on their date of birth (DOB), their expected date of delivery (EDD), or their expected date of delivery and year of school entry. After matching for DOB, preterm infants had an increased odds of SEN (OR 1. 57 (1. 33 - 1. 86)) and the association remained after adjusting for potential confounders (OR 1. 39 (1. 14 - 1. 68)). The association remained in the analysis matching <b>for</b> <b>EDD</b> (fully adjusted OR 1. 43 (1. 17 - 1. 74)) but attenuated after restricting to those infants who were enrolled in school in the same year as the control infants (fully adjusted OR 1. 21 (0. 97 - 1. 52)). There was less evidence for an impact of prematurity on the KS 4 score (Matched for DOB; OR 1. 10 (0. 91 to 1. 34), matched <b>for</b> <b>EDD</b> OR 1. 17 (0. 96 to 1. 42) and EDD and same year of schooling, OR 1. 00 (0. 80 to 1. 26)). This modifiable effect of going to school a year earlier than predicted by their due date appears to have measurable consequences for ex-preterm infants in adolescence and is likely to limit adulthood opportunities...|$|R
