5|$|Another {{impact was}} the {{competition}} with Canada that Australia and New Zealand had with Irish immigration. The increasing Irish immigration was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> economic boon by these antipodean countries. One {{of the reasons}} for the increase was due to many Irish deciding against emigrating to the warring nations of North America.|$|E
5|$|In {{academic}} {{circles the}} case is generally <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> example of the court taking two different approaches to statutory interpretation, with the legalistic approach of the majority judges {{in contrast with the}} purposive approach of the minority judges.|$|E

5|$|Queen Catherine {{remains one}} of the most {{important}} figures in the folk tradition and history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite there being no evidence that she was beatified, the Queen has long been venerated by Catholics in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is increasingly <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> important transethnic state symbol.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} {{generally}} well received by literature critics, and is <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> early classic of the Golden Age of Science Fiction.

5|$|According to 20th Century Fox accounts, however, by April 1980 {{when the}} film had earned a {{reported}} $100million at the box office, after advertising, distribution fees, penalties and other costs were deducted, it was still recorded as having 'lost' $2.4million. This was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> example of Hollywood creative accounting and was much criticised. However, by August, Fox had started saying the film made $4 million in profit.|$|E

5|$|Although {{previous}} Congress governments {{developed the}} capability {{for a nuclear}} weapons test, the Vajpayee government broke with India's historical strategy of avoiding it and authorised Pokhran-II, a series of five nuclear tests in 1998. The tests came soon after Pakistan tested a medium-range ballistic missile. They were <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to display India's military prowess to the world, and a reflection of anti-Pakistan sentiment within the BJP.|$|E
5|$|As a character, Spencer {{has been}} <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> everyman figure, his blank {{expression}} and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype. Spencer displays a pacifistic and fatalistic inactivity throughout the film, simply allowing events to unfold around him without taking control. This passive behavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at the film's climax; his apparent act of infanticide {{is driven by}} his life of being domineered and controlled. Spencer's inactivity has also been seen by film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as a precursor to Lynch's 1983–92 comic strip The Angriest Dog in the World.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice Alice Hicks (January 2, 1919– October 21, 1979) was an American {{engineer}}, {{the first}} woman engineer to be hired by Western Electric, and both co-founder and {{first president of the}} Society of Women Engineers.

During her time there, Hicks developed a gas density switch that would be used in the U.S. space program, including the Apollo moon landing missions.|$|E

5|$|Bo's chief ideological rival, former Guangdong party chief Wang Yang, went on {{to become}} Vice-Premier holding the {{portfolios}} of agriculture, commerce, and poverty reduction. Wen Jiabao, who was seen as Bo's foremost critic in the top leadership, suffered significant public embarrassment himself over a New York Times article about his family's vast empire of wealth whose release coincided closely with Bo's dismissal. Huang Qifan, the mayor of Chongqing long <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ally of Bo, continued his political career basically unscathed. Wang Lijun was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for defection, corruption, and abuse of power.|$|E
5|$|Branch's music {{regularly}} expresses {{religious and}} political themes emphasizing American exceptionalism.

She has released nine singles and an EP, and is working on her debut album for release in 2013.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20thcentury, the {{difficulty}} of navigating the Columbia was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> impediment to the economic development of the Inland Empire region east of the Cascades.

From November18 through December9,2007, he scored in double figures in six consecutive games. On February10,2008, Allen's season-high 20points led Temple to an 80-70 overtime victory over the UMass Minutemen. Allen was benched in the February17 game against Dayton due to missing a study assignment.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Thơ was the Secretary of State for the National Economy. In November, Diệm {{appointed}} Thơ as {{vice president}} {{in an effort to}} widen the regime's popular appeal. The appointment was endorsed by the National Assembly in December 1956, in accordance with the constitution. The move was widely <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to use Thơ's Mekong Delta roots to increase the government's popular appeal among southern peasants, because Diệm's regime was dominated by family members, Catholics from central Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} the original, Thompson {{returned}} to Nanny McPhee with 2010's Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang. Her screenplay transported the story to Britain during the Second World War, and incorporated a new cast including Maggie Gyllenhaal. Building on the first film's success, it was another UK box office number one and the sequel was widely <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> improvement. The same year, Thompson reunited with Alan Rickman for the BBC television film The Song of Lunch, which focused on two unnamed characters meeting at a restaurant 15 years after ending their relationship. Thompson's performance earned her a fourth Emmy Award nomination.|$|E

5|$|From the Albanian perspective, adopted also by Italian and Austrian {{sources of}} that time, the Northern Epirote {{movement}} was directly {{supported by the}} Greek state, {{with the help of}} a minority of inhabitants in the region, resulting in chaos and political instability in all of Albania. In Albanian historiography, the Protocol of Corfu is either scarcely mentioned or <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to divide the Albanian state and proof of the Great Powers' disregard for Albania's national integrity.|$|E
5|$|Harold Innis {{wrote his}} PhD thesis {{on the history}} of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The {{completion}} of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.|$|E
5|$|Having {{made only}} 5 and 18 in the {{previous}} Test, Jack Crapp was originally dropped from the team but was reprieved by Washbrook's injury. The England selectors were widely condemned for their decisions, which were <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> investment in youth rather than necessarily picking the best players available at the time. Their frequent changes meant the home team had used a total of 21 players for the five Tests.|$|E
