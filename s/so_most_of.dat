5|$|Following the {{unification}} of Italy in 1861, the new Regia Marina (Royal Navy) began a construction program to prepare a fleet of ironclad warships capable of defeating the Austrian Navy. Italy considered the Austrian Empire to be its main rival, since it controlled predominantly Italian areas, including Venice. The nascent Italian shipyards were incapable of building the number of ships the new fleet would require, <b>so</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> this first generation of ironclads were built by foreign ship builders. In 1861, the two ships of the Re d'Italia class were ordered from the American shipyard owned by William H. Webb, {{under the direction of}} General Luigi Federico Menabrea, then the Italian Navy Minister. The design for the ships was based heavily on the contemporary French ironclad , but they did not meet the high expectations the Italian fleet placed upon them.|$|E

5|$|The winning {{candidates}} were informed {{of their success}} in an e-mail from NRP and were also sent various contracts to sign and return.

5|$|The first {{qualifying}} session began {{under the}} threat of rain, <b>so</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the teams tried to set a good lap time before the conditions deteriorated. The Audis and Peugeots swapped the overall pole position several times, {{and at the end}} of the session the No. 1 Audi was fastest overall with a time of 3.28.301. The No. 33 Barazi-Epsilon Zytek led LMP2, after an earlier misfiring problem had been repaired. Oreca's Saleens were the fastest two GT1 cars, while Ferrari and Porsche were close to one another in GT2. The session was red flagged about halfway through because of an accident in which the No. 53 JLOC Lamborghini Murciélago, driven by Marco Apicella, hit the wall at the first Mulsanne chicane. The No. 25 Ray Mallock Ltd. Lola and No. 81 LNT Panoz were the only cars not to set a lap time before the session briefly returned to green as rain began. The ACO extended the session by fifteen minutes to compensate for the earlier red flag.|$|E

25|$|The inexistence of {{nationwide}} gendarmerie, {{meant that}} the Army would partially be employed in that role, mainly {{in the rural areas}} of the country. <b>So,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Army units were frequently requested by the local administrative authorities to maintain public order and to perform other police duties, employing in these services an important part of their personnel.|$|E
