500|$|Taylor said in 1980, [...] "I {{was getting}} a bit fed up. I wanted to broaden my scope as a guitarist and do <b>something</b> <b>else...</b> <b>I</b> wasn't really {{composing}} songs or writing at that time. I {{was just beginning to}} write, and that influenced my decision... There are some people who can just ride along from crest to crest; they can ride along somebody else's success. And there are some people for whom that's not enough. It really wasn't enough for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the Crew Cut Man, saying [...] "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, {{this is the guy}} who killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode just seems like half of one thing for a while, then half of <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> think that was a curious choice for Chris [...] He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him." [...] X-Files writer James Wong also had a negative view of the episode, saying [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} most confusing episodes I've ever seen. It had some really neat ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally." ...|$|E
2500|$|I'd {{been getting}} {{bored with the}} stereotyped changes that were being used, ... and I kept {{thinking}} there's bound to be <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> could hear it sometimes. I couldn't play it.... I was working over 'Cherokee,' and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. It came alive—Parker.|$|E
60|$|I {{believe he}} said <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> but <b>I</b> never heard it. I was already fast asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Like him! I'd wish <b>something</b> <b>else</b> before <b>I</b> wished that,' said Ellen. 'Don't {{think about}} it, Alfred dear; here are Miss Jane's pictures.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Jenney said <b>something</b> <b>else</b> that--that <b>I</b> {{wanted to}} ask you about," [...] she went on, {{breathing}} more deeply. [...] "It was about the railroad." ...|$|R
2500|$|In December 2011, Romney stated: [...] "I {{kind of like}} America. I'm {{not looking}} {{for it to be}} {{fundamentally}} transformed into <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> don't want it to become like Europe." [...] In January 2012, Romney said: [...] "We want to ensure that we remain a free and prosperous land of opportunity. This president takes his inspiration from the capitals of Europe; we look to the cities and small towns of America." [...] Romney accused President Obama of wanting to [...] "turn America into a European-style entitlement society." ...|$|E
2500|$|My {{whole body}} changed into <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> {{could see through}} myself. And I went up... I wasn't in human form... I landed on a planet that I {{identified}} as Saturn... they teleported me and I was down on [...] stage with them. They wanted to talk with me. They had one little antenna on each ear. A little antenna over each eye. They talked to me. They told me to stop [...] because {{there was going to}} be great trouble in schools... the world was going into complete chaos... I would speak , and the world would listen. That's what they told me.|$|E
2500|$|... "It was, I wouldn't say hypocritical. I {{think they}} are {{genuinely}} happy to see a Chinese director win an Academy Award with good artistic value. I think that pride is genuine, so I would not think that's hypocritical at all. Not only in my judgment, I literally meet people who are genuinely happy. No, no, I don't think so, it's just like they don't want homosexual movie shown in the movies, it's hard to put American logic... It's just <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> don't know how to describe it, it's just something else. So what can I say?"The word [...] "brokeback" [...] (...) has entered the Chinese lexicon as a slang word for homosexuality. As well as this, the film, upon its release was dubbed by the press [...] "the gay cowboy movie" [...] which is a term that was propelled into the American vernacular.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is <b>something</b> <b>else</b> which <b>I</b> {{must tell}} you before I leave [...] England. Come to me at once. The bearer will bring you. Come alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is <b>something</b> <b>else</b> that <b>I</b> {{want to say}} to you," [...] she resumed. [...] "My {{friend had}} a loss while she was staying at the inn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{for that}} dance, of course. But {{now you are}} engaged to him for <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> and <b>I</b> tell you that I {{knew it was going}} to be so." ...|$|R
2500|$|O'Neal {{announced}} his retirement via social media on June 1, 2011. Two days later, O'Neal {{held a press conference}} at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement. When asked who was the greatest player he ever played with during his career, O'Neal did not answer but Bryant was the only player whose name was mentioned. He also mentioned that his departure from Los Angeles {{has nothing to do with}} Kobe Bryant, saying [...] "the reason I left wasn't about what Kobe did; it was about <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> was making maximum dollars and felt I deserved more. It was a business end." [...] When asked whether leaving Los Angeles was a bad decision, he answered [...] "I don't like to live in a world of ifs. But if we would have stayed, possibly we could have got six [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Radwańska's main {{weaknesses}} is {{her lack}} of power in her serve. Her serve, especially her second serve, is generally slow and vulnerable to attack. Her shots sometimes lack penetration on court, posing little threat to power hitters. [...] "I don't think I can ever serve 200 kilometers per hour, it's just not my body," [...] Radwańska said. [...] "I have to do <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> was just born to play like this. I have so many ideas. In your mind it's like, 'OK, I go down the line, then crosscourt, maybe drop shot.' But you have just one second, or even not one second, it just has to be automatic." [...] Radwańska merely exhales when she strikes the ball, rather than loudly grunting like many of her peers. She bounces the ball {{no more than four}} times before serving. She says she can play with any racket and likes to use one for an entire match, unlike most players, who routinely grab frames with fresh strings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--ghost. Generically--provisionally. We always {{consider}} them ghosts, don't we, till they prove themselves <b>something</b> <b>else?</b> <b>I</b> once saw an apparition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shadows {{remind me}} of Midwinter; or, if the shadows don't, <b>something</b> <b>else</b> does. <b>I</b> must have another look at his letter, and then I will {{positively}} go to bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have every}} excuse," [...] he answered. [...] "But you trouble {{me all the}} same. There was <b>something</b> <b>else</b> that <b>I</b> had to say to you--and your curiosity gets in the way." ...|$|R
5000|$|Frustrated {{with the}} evident artificiality of the blowpipe, an item that {{could hardly have}} been used without being seen by another passenger, Poirot {{suggests}} that the means of delivering the dart may have been <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>Is</b> it the flute of one passenger, or perhaps one of the ancient tubes carried by one of the two French archaeologists (father and son) on board? Or maybe Lady Horbury's long cigarette holder? Why were there two coffee spoons in the victim's saucer? ...|$|R
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. I do {{not think}} I can rest. I think there is <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>I</b> have to do, I forget what it is.|$|E
60|$|And there's <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>I</b> {{must tell}} you.... It appears that various enterprising {{people have been}} laying plans to put {{me out of the}} way.|$|E
6000|$|... "On what? O yes; on my eleven {{thousand}} pounds, you mean. Well, since I didn't get <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> <b>I</b> must {{be content}} with getting that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mr. Knightley.'--You {{always called}} me, 'Mr. Knightley;' and, from habit, {{it has not}} so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal. I want you to call me <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> but <b>I</b> do not know what." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look round here {{a minute}} more," [...] said Mr. George; [...] "there is <b>something</b> <b>else</b> that <b>I</b> wish {{to explain to}} you. You see there are no bridges below this, though {{there are a great}} many above." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And just {{at present}} there is <b>something</b> <b>else</b> that <b>I</b> {{specially}} {{want to say}} to you. Indeed, I went to Silverbridge on the same subject yesterday, and have come here expressly to have a little conversation with you." ...|$|R

6000|$|KIT. Then, shake hands. You're {{an honest}} man, Pew--old Pew!--and I'll make your fortune. But there's <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> if <b>I</b> {{could keep the}} run of it. Oh, ah! But can you? That's the point. Can you? don't you see? ...|$|R
5000|$|Goma: I am very {{surprised}} to see...this verdict {{to come on}} me, because I was not expecting that. When I came, they told me <b>something</b> <b>else</b> and <b>I</b> am coming. [...] "You got an interview," [...] that's all. So a big surprise anyway.|$|R
60|$|I {{have had}} another {{note from the}} editor of the 'New Monthly Magazine'--very flattering, and praying for farther supplies. The Angels were not ready, and I was obliged to send <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> which <b>I</b> will not ask you to read. So don't be very uneasy.|$|R
6000|$|GEOFFREY [Not remembering.] I did! Must {{have been}} {{thinking}} of <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> shall be in here if you want me. [He goes into the other room.] ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Jack. [...] "Now I want <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> want to {{know what}} Mrs. Housekeeper has been saying. I have been seriously alarmed about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Lady, returning: [...] "Oh, yes! Give me your pencil." [...] She {{writes on}} a piece of the white wrapping-paper. [...] "There! That is it."

6000|$|... "Yes, dear; {{but while}} the grass grows, the horse starves. At any rate, I will try for <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> If <b>I</b> get anything, it won't prevent my writing; and when my genius is recognized, I can drop the other thing, and take to {{literature}} regularly, again.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} on VH1's Behind the Music, Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh stated {{in reaction to the}} song that: [...] "I was in shock. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard.
