The restrictions {{of the new}} law are <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> third countries have warned about the interference with their trade. However under Obama, Iran's oil exports have been halved.|$|E
25|$|During descent {{the air in}} {{the suit}} is {{compressed}} and unless more is added, the folds may be pressed together so tightly by water pressure that they pinch the skin, which is painful and may cause local bruising. The suit may also become <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> movement is restricted, particularly in a membrane suit. This problem is managed by suit inflation from a low pressure gas supply.|$|E

Liner bushings, sometimes called master bushings, are permanently installed into the jig and accept liners that can easily be replaced. Press-fit wearing bushings are used in short run applications or in applications where the tolerance on a hole location is <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> it cannot facilitate {{the use of a}} liner bushing.|$|E
25|$|After {{the failure}} of the Nanchang Uprising, Zhou left China for the Soviet Union to attend the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Sixth National Party Congress in Moscow, in June–July 1928. The Sixth Congress had to be held in Moscow because {{conditions}} in China were considered dangerous. KMT control was <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> many Chinese delegates attending the Sixth Congress were forced to travel in disguise: Zhou himself was disguised as an antiquarian.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains in}} the ossuary were placed with great care and were {{undamaged}} {{at the time of}} burial. In order to maximise the use of space, the remains were packed very tightly together; <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> it was nearly impossible to identify individual skeletons unless articulated. Due to the tightly compacted nature of this ossuary, bones were broken or bent {{in the shape of the}} walls (particularly long bones). These fractures are not consistent with trampling and because the broken ends remained in close proximity, it was interpreted that great care was taken to minimize damage to the bones in the filling and packing of the ossuary.|$|E
50|$|One sign of {{a frozen}} {{shoulder}} is that the joint becomes <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> and stiff <b>that</b> {{it is nearly impossible}} to carry out simple movements, such as raising the arm. The movement that is most severely inhibited is external rotation of the shoulder.|$|R

500|$|The mixing was {{supposed}} to be overseen by the band members, but their schedule in October was <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> Lawrence did it without them. This dismayed the band at first, but the sound turned out cleaner, heavier and more polished than on their debut. The tapes were mixed in both mono and stereo, but the mono tapes were trashed, as neither Tetragrammaton nor EMI, Deep Purple's British label, [...] had any use for them.|$|E
500|$|Bradner met {{his future}} wife, Marjorie Hall Bradner, {{who was also}} working as a {{secretary}} on the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos [...] Laboratory. The couple were married in Los Alamos in 1943. Security at the top secret facility was <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> neither Bradner's nor Hall's parents were allowed to attend the ceremony, though Oppenheimer was among the wedding guests. The couple remained together for over 65 years until she died on April 10, 2008 {{at the age of}} 89.|$|E
500|$|In {{the prose}} {{introduction}} to the poem Sigrdrífumál, the hero Sigurd rides up to Hindarfell and heads south towards [...] "the land of the Franks". On the mountain Sigurd sees a great light, [...] "as if fire were burning, which blazed up to the sky". Sigurd approaches it, and there he sees a skjaldborg with a banner flying overhead. Sigurd enters the skjaldborg, and sees a warrior lying there—asleep and fully armed. Sigurd removes the helmet of the warrior, and sees {{the face of a}} woman. The woman's corslet is <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> it seems to have grown into the woman's body. Sigurd uses his sword Gram to cut the corslet, starting from the neck of the corslet downwards, he continues cutting down her sleeves, and takes the corslet off of her.|$|E
50|$|A {{potometer}} (from Greek ποτό = drunken, and μέτρο = measure) —sometimes {{known as}} a transpirometer— is a device used for measuring the rate of water uptake of a leafy shoot. The causes of water uptake are photosynthesis and transpiration. Everything must be completely water <b>tight</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> no leakage of water occurs.|$|R
2500|$|However, in {{the second}} half of the century, courtiers are often shown, if they have the figure for it, wearing nothing over their closely {{tailored}} cotehardie. [...] A French chronicle records: [...] "Around that year (1350), men, in particular noblemen and their squires, took to wearing tunics <b>so</b> short and <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> they revealed what modesty bids us hide. [...] This was a most astonishing thing for the people".|$|R
5000|$|Each {{evening before}} going to bed, and each morning as soon as I got up, one of the under governesses drew the laces a little <b>tighter,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> in a week my waist was reduced five inches. After that, I was only reduced half an inch a month, till, when I left, I {{measured}} just seventeen inches.|$|R
500|$|The {{handover}} on {{the first}} day was <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> builders moved out at midday, and the first service was run at 7pm that evening. The late opening resulted in the reviewers for the Michelin Guide having only a two-week window in which to re-assess the restaurant for the 2008 guide. Bosi admitted later that the restaurant was not yet up to scratch in those two weeks and agreed with the decision of Michelin to downgrade Hibiscus to a single star in the 2008 Guide. The restaurant was also given a [...] "rising star" [...] as one with potential to go up to two stars in the future. During the run up to Christmas, the stress of serving 550 covers a week in a new location with a modified menu resulted in three sous chefs resigning.|$|E
500|$|Casting for the {{character}} was hectic, with Oberman describing the process as a [...] "whirlwind" [...] affair. The role of the second Mrs Den Watts was highly sought after with Oberman eventually beating out high-profile stars like Patsy Kensit, Cheryl Baker and Joanna Lumley for the part. In a 2004 'Star Chat' interview featured in The People, Oberman commented on her casting: [...] "I couldn't have wished for a better part. I mean the Watts family are a national institution. When I realised I was auditioning {{for the role of}} Dirty Den's wife, my jaw just dropped. I never thought I'd get it. Amazing, swanky actresses, like Joanna Lumley and Patsy Kensit, were all considered, but Leslie Grantham and I had great chemistry from the off and I think he said: 'I want her.'" [...] Oberman was on holiday when she received a call saying she had been cast in the role and was required to be on set the next Tuesday. All told the audition process had taken just two weeks, with Oberman beginning filming a mere ten days after her initial screen test. In fact the schedule was <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> Oberman was on set and taping scenes before a contract had even been signed.|$|E
2500|$|Howard Jones says [...] "Madame Nhu was chauffeured {{in a black}} Mercedes {{and wore}} a small diamond crucifix", and [...] "wore form-fitting apparel <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> one French {{correspondent}} suggestively described her as 'molded into her ... dress like a dagger in its sheath.' On formal occasions, she wore red satin pantaloons with three vertical pleats, which was {{the mark of the}} highest-ranking women of the imperial court in ancient Annam." [...] When Diệm once criticized her apparel, she snapped: [...] "It's not your neck that sticks out, it's mine. So, shut up." ...|$|E

My hands are {{fastened}} <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> now <b>that</b> the ropes seem cutting into my wrists, and after they had set me on my feet and cut the cords of my legs I could scarcely stand at first, my feet were so numbed by the pressure. However, we must keep up our pluck. Possibly they may keep us at Canton for a bit, {{and if they do}} the squadron may arrive and fight its way past the forts and take the city before they have quite made up their minds as to what kind of death will be most appropriate to the occasion. I wonder what they are doing now? They seem to be chopping sticks." ...|$|R
5000|$|But it was Yuja Wang's orange {{dress for}} which Tuesday night {{is likely to}} remembered ... Her dress Tuesday was <b>so</b> short and <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> had there been any less of it, the Bowl might {{have been forced to}} {{restrict}} admission to any music lover under 18 not accompanied by an adult. Had her heels been any higher, walking, to say nothing of her sensitive pedaling, would have been unfeasible.Swed was widely criticised for this aspect of his review.|$|R

2500|$|... "You and I {{should not}} now {{pull on the}} ends of the rope in which you have tied a knot of war, because the harder you and I pull, the tighter the knot will become. And a time may come when this knot is tied <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> the person who tied it is no longer capable of untying it, and then the knot will have to be cut. What that would mean I need not explain to you, because you {{yourself}} understand perfectly what dreaded forces our two countries possess." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{researcher}} Rachael Hutchinson, [...] "although Taki is {{sheathed in}} fabric, it is <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> {{the shape of}} her body is clearly visible, making her the only female character with visible nipples and pubis. Taki is arguably the most sexualized of all the female characters [...] in this respect, although her costume is very strong and powerful where the costumes of Sophitia, Xianghua and Seung Mi-na are softer and more fluid." [...] The game's producer Hisaharu Tago said of her appearance in Soulcalibur V, in which Taki is depicted as over 40, [...] "In terms of her outfit, we don't know if she'll be in body tights." ...|$|E
50|$|The four {{coupled axles}} {{were very close}} together, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>tight</b> curves could be negotiated. The centre axles were {{installed}} with side play, which meant the connecting rod had to drive the fourth axle. The wheelbase was only 2.6 metres and, with the overall length of the locomotive being almost 8.5 metres, it had very long overhangs. The result was a relatively rough ride.|$|R
6000|$|... "It will do no good," [...] {{said the}} teacher, [...] "for he won't come open, {{if he can}} {{possibly}} help it. And there's another fellow (pointing). His name is Slivertwist. If you get a crack in him, you will find him full of twisted splinters that he holds himself together with. The only way is to cut them through with a sharp axe. But he holds on <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> with them <b>that</b> I don't believe you can get him open. He says he never gives up to boys." ...|$|R
50|$|To {{properly}} inspect a shinai, {{one first}} examines {{the area around}} the datotsu-bu, inspecting all sides of the shinai for splinters. This is very important, as bamboo splinters can easily cause injury. The saki-gawa should be intact and the tsuru should be <b>tight</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the saki-gawa does not slip off the end of the shinai during use. In addition, the nakayui should be tight enough as not to rotate easily.|$|R
2500|$|A crupper {{needs to}} be snug {{enough to keep the}} saddle or harness in place, but not <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> the horse is irritated or the skin of the tail is damaged. [...] Cruppers are {{adjusted}} to engage only when needed; pressure is not meant to be constantly applied. [...] If a crupper is too tight, it can cause severe chafing, discomfort and sores. If it is too loose, the saddle or harness may not stay in the proper position. If used in an improper manner for too long a period of time, the horse may even [...] become disabled in the hindquarters. [...] The loop of a crupper is kept very clean.|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} {{became so}} tense that {{war with the}} United States seemed imminent. On April 22, 1914, on the initiative of Felix A. Sommerfeld and Sherburne Hopkins, Pancho Villa traveled to Juárez to calm fears along the border and asked President Wilson's emissary George Carothers to tell [...] "Señor Wilson" [...] {{that he had no}} problems with the American occupation of Veracruz. Carothers wrote to Secretary William Jennings Bryan: [...] "As {{far as he was concerned}} we could keep Vera Cruz [...] and hold it <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> not even water could get in to Huerta and [...] [...] [...] he could not feel any resentment". Whether trying to please the U.S. government or through the diplomatic efforts of Sommerfeld and Carothers, or maybe as a result of both, Villa stepped out from under Carranza’s stated foreign policy.|$|E
2500|$|After Sekret Sekret disbanded, The Cruel Sea {{was formed}} in late 1987 by Elliot on drums and Rumour on guitar. They enlisted Dee Corben on bass guitar and his brother, Gerard [...] "Ged" [...] Corben (also in Lime Spiders), on guitar. The name was from a 1964 surf instrumental, [...] "Cruel Sea", by United States group The Ventures (a cover of The Dakotas' 1963 single, which was in turn {{inspired}} by the novel and film of the same name). Early gigs in 1988 were played at the Harold Park Hotel, behind a pool table where space was <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> <b>that</b> the guitarists had {{to move out of}} the way when pool players took a shot. The original line-up played about 20 shows and parties, then Dee Corben left, he was replaced by former Sekret Sekret bandmate, Gormly. Barry Turnbull (ex-John Kennedy's Love Gone Wrong, The Widdershins) briefly substituted for Gormly on bass guitar. James Cruickshank (The Widdershins) joined on keyboards and guitars.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Garfield, Magic creator, {{acted as}} the sole {{designer}} for the set, and developed it in parallel with other teams working on what would become Ice Age and Mirage. The Ice Age design team, composed of Jim Lin, Chris Page, Dave Pettey, and Skaff Elias, was called upon to become the development team for Arabian Nights as well, but instead of playtesting the set they managed only to submit some comments because their schedule was <b>so</b> <b>tight.</b> At <b>that</b> point in Magics development, the role of expansions was relatively undefined, and Garfield intended for Arabian Nights cards to bear a purple and gold back that would allow players to exclude Arabian Nights from their games. In his article, [...] "The Making of Arabian Nights", Garfield cites this as his inspiration to [...] "be more adventurous in creating mechanics and themes".|$|R

She dressed in ultra-tight skirts (<b>so</b> <b>tight</b> in fact, <b>that</b> she would lie down on the stage and shuffle back and forth on her back to pick up whatever she had contrived to drop). Her hat sported a lone daisy, feather, or fish bone, and once even a lit candle (supposedly, so she could see where she was going and where she had been).|$|R
60|$|The {{reason for}} this {{reluctance}} to dismount is that the nights are howlingly cold, black, and windswept, and a car is a haven of refuge. From village to village the miners travel, {{for a change of}} cinema, of girl, of pub. The trams are desperately packed. Who is going to risk himself in the black gulf outside, to wait perhaps an hour for another tram, then to see the forlorn notice 'Depot Only', because there is something wrong! Or to greet a unit of three bright cars all <b>so</b> <b>tight</b> with people <b>that</b> they sail past with a howl of derision. Trams that pass in the night.|$|R
