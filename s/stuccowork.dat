25|$|The {{estate was}} {{purchased}} sometime in 1928 by the Dominicaines de l'Immaculée Conception, {{an order of}} Dominican sisters who catered {{to the needs of}} blind children. They transformed the place to suit their needs - converting the library to a chapel, the orangery into a retreat house, and the attics into dormitories. They also concealed some of the <b>stuccowork</b> sculptures of classical figures installed by Lefranc, but these are have now been revealed again. In 1929 the mother house and novitiate moved from Toulouse to Pompignan. The chateau was sold again when the order moved back to Toulouse in 1987.|$|E
2500|$|According to the German art {{historian}} Cornelius Gurlitt, [...] "the abbey church of Wilhering {{is the most}} brilliant achievement of the Rococo style in the German-speaking world." [...] It {{gives the impression that}} more decoration, colour, sculptures, paintings and <b>stuccowork</b> could not be found in a single place. The Baroque dream that heavenly light-heartedness and timeless happiness can be brought down to earth, a dream which in the Rococo period reached its nearly unrestrained climax, has come true at Wilhering. Moreover, all the individual elements are in harmony and seem to be connected in some way: the altars, the pulpit, the two organs, the choir stalls, the putti and the frescoes with numerous saints, with clouds and blue sky. These artists had a uniform feeling for style and taste.|$|E

40|$|Stucco samples moulded {{during a}} long period (from 1500 to 1700) were {{collected}} from Palazzo Grimani in Venice to study the binder and the working techniques. Three types of mixtures based on calcite and magnesite, on calcite, magnesite and gypsum and finally only on calcite were detected. The presence of magnesite in <b>stuccoworks</b> brings up questions about the employment of this substance, probably added to modify the workability and the aspect of the stuccoes...|$|R
40|$|The {{finishes}} applied on <b>stuccoworks</b> deserves in-depth analytical investigations. A complete chemical andmorphological {{survey is}} very useful in reconstructing the artist’s technique, {{the history of}} the artworksthrough the sequence of the applied layers, and is needed as a basis for any conservation approach. Microscopic observations, both optical and electronic (SEM), and spectroscopic analyses (Raman, FTIRand EDS) of gilded and polychrome finishes on plaster relieves, were carried out on 17 samples from acelebrated neoclassical hall in the Royal Palace of Milan (Hall of Caryatids). The original decorative patternhad been damaged during a bomb-induced fire in the Second World War. Most of the surfaces have beenfatally compromised and blackened by the effects of the fire. The survey presented here analysed thematerials constituting the stucco surfaces and the damage induced by the fire. Green pigments wereindividuated and mapped, although no green surfaces were visible to the naked eye. It was thereforepossible to reconstruct a decorative pattern painted in green, gold and white, similar to traditions ofdecoration in Austria and southern Germany...|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Rococo {{mirror and}} <b>stuccowork</b> in Schloss Ludwigsburg reflect the style's {{characteristic}} anti-architectural integration {{of materials and}} forms ...|$|E
50|$|The church {{ceiling is}} {{decorated}} with Baroque and Rococo <b>stuccowork,</b> with frescoes by Johann Georg Bergmüller. The Goldsmith's Chapel (Goldschmiedkapelle) was donated in 1420 by Conrad and Afra Hirn.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{originally}} built in 1540 for Cardinal Girolamo Capodiferro. Bartolomeo Baronino, of Casale Monferrato, was the architect, while Giulio Mazzoni {{and a team}} provided lavish <b>stuccowork</b> inside and out.|$|E
50|$|The palace's {{relatively}} modest west façade, on Krakowskie Przedmieście, is embellished with some fine <b>stuccowork,</b> {{and the central}} balcony is supported by four elegant stone Atlantes carved in 1787 by André Le Brun.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{excavated}} by Pietro Rosa in 1850 who reconstructed a single marble column and travertine supports. In 1852 segments of concrete vaulting with <b>stuccowork</b> coffering was unearthed but later destroyed in 1872.|$|E
50|$|Despite several {{alterations}} to its interior, {{it is one}} of the few palazzi in Florence to {{have retained}} much of its interior furniture (essentially in the Empire style) and decoration, notably frescoes, <b>stuccowork</b> and sculpted fireplaces.|$|E
5000|$|The Łańcut Synagogue, {{built in}} 1761. {{although}} plain on the exterior, the interior {{walls and ceiling}} are decorated with restorations of paintings and <b>stuccowork</b> from the 18th century and polychromies from the 19th - 20th centuries.|$|E
50|$|The Audience Chamber {{is a small}} {{circular}} room adjoining the Antechamber and the Mythological Corridor. A {{door leading}} from the Audience Chamber to a staircase was preserved from the Trèkovský dùm, {{one of the original}} properties on the site. Several other salvaged architectural pieces were incorporated into the palace. <b>Stuccowork</b> and paintings depict Ovid’s Four ages and portraits of the Four Periods of the Day. The Baroque <b>stuccowork</b> of the dome in the Audience Chamber is mirrored in the Mythological corridor. The mythological corridor also has murals depicting planet motifs and legends such as Mercury & Argus, Diana and Acteon, Perseus killing Medusa, Callisto metamorphosed into a bear, and the Rape of Europa. Ovid’s Metamorphoses inspired Baccio del Bianco's frescoes in this corridor.|$|E
5000|$|Construction {{took place}} between 1745 and 1754, and the {{interior}} was decorated with frescoes and with <b>stuccowork</b> {{in the tradition of}} the Wessobrunner School. [...] "Everything was done throughout the church to make the supernatural visible. Sculpture and murals combined to unleash the divine in visible form".|$|E
50|$|This {{magnificent}} {{temple was}} built by Siromani Chudamoni Devi, the queen of Raja Bir Singha Dev and mother of Durjan Singha Dev in 1665. This latente ekratna temple is dedicated to Murali Mohan Jiu. A few decorations of floral designs is noticed. <b>Stuccowork</b> is found in this temple.|$|E
50|$|In 1738, Giuseppe Martelli Maria, Archbishop of Florence and Niccolo Martelli, bailiff of Florence, unified the palaces {{under the}} designs of the {{architect}} Bernardino Ciurini. The piano nobile of the palace was decorated by frescoes by Vincenzo Meucci, Ferdinando Melani, Niccolò Connestabile, and Bernardo Minozzi, as well as <b>stuccowork</b> by Giovanni Martino Portogalli.|$|E
50|$|The two {{ground floor}} rooms include white <b>stuccowork,</b> {{typical of the}} early and mid 16th century white-on-white-and-gold style which began to {{dominate}} Florence after {{the arrival of the}} Albertoli brothers. On the first floor is the main salon with rich white <b>stuccowork</b> commissioned by the Compagni family in the 18th century, gilded furniture, a large Murano ware glass vessel and two history paintings commissioned by Sloane from Giuseppe Bezzuoli - they are entitled Dino Compagni trying to make peace between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines inside the baptistery and The laying of the foundation stone for the basilica of Santa Croce in the presence of Pope Pius IX and Vittorio Emanuele II. At the four corners of the room are four coats of arms celebrating other important Florentine families linked to the Compagni family by marriage.|$|E
50|$|All tombs {{have been}} beautifully carved and are {{magnificent}} pieces of art. The {{detail of the}} <b>stuccowork</b> on these structures is intricate. They have become extremely popular because of the geometrical features carved on them. Apart from the geometrical designs, the floral designs, trellis marble fencing and canopies are also very intricate and beautiful.|$|E
50|$|Between 1766-1783, the {{architect}} Gaspare Paoletti, {{during the third}} and final renovation of the villa, accomplished the definitive restructuring of the villa to twice its previous size. Paoletti added the two flanking inner courtyards to the central courtyard, and also designed the rear facade and the great ballroom on the piano nobile. This was embellished with the notable <b>stuccowork</b> by Giocondo and Grato Albertolli.|$|E
5000|$|Next to the prang is the Ordination Hall with a Niramitr Buddha image {{supposedly}} {{designed by}} King Rama II. The front {{entrance of the}} Ordination Hall has a roof with a central spire, decorated in coloured ceramic and <b>stuccowork</b> sheated in coloured china. There are two demons, or temple guardian figures, in front. [...] The murals were created {{during the reign of}} Rama V.|$|E
50|$|During the 16th-century Protestant Reformation and German Peasants' War {{the monastic}} {{community}} decayed. In {{the course of}} the 1552 rebellion against Emperor Charles V, the premises were plundered by the troops of Elector Maurice of Saxony; even the grave of Maurice' brother Severinus was destroyed. The monastery was largely rebuilt in its present-day Baroque style from the early 17th century onwards, including Wessobrunner <b>stuccowork</b> by Franz Xaver Feuchtmayer.|$|E
50|$|The Cappella Palatina ("Palace Chapel") {{was built}} in 1683 by the {{brothers}} Giuseppe and Giacomo Serpotta, with a great profusion of precious marble, <b>stuccowork,</b> putti, and friezes that commemorate the most resplendent moments {{in the history of}} the House of Ventimiglia. Here is kept the holy relic of the skull of Saint Anne, in an urn that acts as the pedestal to the sculpted bust of Castelbuono's patron saint.|$|E
50|$|In Spain, {{the dome}} of Seville's Santa Maria la Blanca (begun 1659) used stucco to create high-relief {{scrolling}} foliage patterns like those of Islamic arabesque ornament. In Granada, <b>stuccowork</b> was introduced by Francisco Hurtado Izquierdo and used to embellish classical forms in the dome (c. 1702) and sacristy dome (c. 1713-42) of La Cartuja, in contrast to earlier vaults {{such as that of}} San Jerónimo (1523-43), which used diagonal ribs in an idiosyncratic way and had apparent Moorish influences.|$|E
50|$|Echteler {{was the son}} of the {{economist}} and baker Leonhard Echteler und Marianna von Sandholz. After tending to sheep and cattle up to age twelve, he learned the craft of stone masonry, carving, <b>stuccowork</b> and sculpting at a chiseler in Leutkirch im Allgäu. On his journeyman years he came to Stuttgart, where he visited the fine arts school. From November 1872 he continued his artistic education at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich under Max von Widnmann and Joseph Knabl.|$|E
50|$|Chief {{among several}} major changes was the {{relocated}} entrance, {{from the street}} formerly known as Via del Teatro (where the garden of the Hotel Quirinale is now) to the opposite side, where Piazza Beniamino Gigli exists today. In addition, the amphitheatre inside the theatre {{was replaced by a}} fourth tier of boxes (now the third tier) and the balcony. The interior was embellished by new <b>stuccowork,</b> decorations, and furnishings, including a magnificent chandelier measuring six meters in diameter and composed of 27,000 crystal drops.|$|E
5000|$|An {{article in}} The Hindu, [...] "Crying for Attention," [...] cited plant growth invading local mosques. [...] "It doesn't require a {{connoisseur}} {{to see the}} rot that has set in the Qutb Shahi Khairtabad Mosque and Khairati Begum's tomb in Khairatabad," [...] both protected architectural monuments. [...] "The lime plaster and <b>stuccowork</b> can be seen peeling off at many places. There are ... fissures in the structure with vegetation growing from the minarets. The vegetal growth is particularly heavy {{at the rear of}} the mosque." ...|$|E
5000|$|Between 1623 - 1636, at the {{initiative}} of Sigismund III Vasa and later completed by his son Wladyslaw IV Vasa, the Baroque style Saint Casimir chapel by royal architect Constantino Tencalla was built of Swedish sandstone. Its interior was reconstructed in 1691-1692 and decorated with frescoes by Michelangelo Palloni, the altar and <b>stuccowork</b> by Pietro Perti. This chapel contains sculpted statutes of Jagiellon kings and an epitaph with Wladyslaw IV Vasa's heart. More {{than anything in the}} Cathedral this chapel symbolizes the glory of Polish-Lithuanian union and common history.|$|E
50|$|In decor {{the ceiling}} has {{returned}} to its Elizabethan form, which involves either timber with exposed beams or flat patterned stucco. Beams are commonly used in a grid formation for aesthetic purposes and can be left in their natural state or painted. Free-hand <b>stuccowork</b> and inset stucco have also been revived as they enable {{a small amount of}} ornamentation on a generally flat surface, although both are quite costly. Ceiling papering has also become popular as it provides visual variety without being obtrusive. Ceiling papers differ from wallpapers in that their patterns are non-directional and powdered so as they do not become overbearing.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} opens {{straight into}} the Italianate hall. The walls are adorned with busts of Roman emperors set into oval niches and the panelled ceiling is stuccoed with rococo motifs. The dining room on the south front was especially designed to display works by Canaletto and Giovanni Paolo Panini. The original works are long gone, being replaced by copies. The drawing room has panels of elaborate <b>stuccowork</b> featuring scrolls, shells, fruit and flowers; these serve {{as a framework for}} more Italian works of art. A stucco garland of fruit and flowers encircles the skylight above the staircase hall.|$|E
50|$|The {{estate was}} {{purchased}} sometime in 1928 by the Dominicaines de l'Immaculée Conception, {{an order of}} Dominican sisters who catered {{to the needs of}} blind children.

In 1929 the mother house and novitiate moved from Toulouse to Pompignan. The chateau was sold again when the order moved back to Toulouse in 1987.|$|E
50|$|After the Thirty Years War, the Palace {{underwent}} {{a number of}} significant changes, particularly under Václav Eusebius, 2nd Prince Lobkowicz. He was responsible for the palace’s significant baroque alterations and some of its more lavishly decorated salons. Václav Eusebius redesigned the palace in the Italianate style. His design influence can be seen today in the Imperial Hall, whose walls are painted in fresco with trompe l'oeil statues of emperors surrounded by geometric designs, floral and other decorative motifs. Additional examples of the Italianate style are the Concert Hall and the Balcony Room, whose ceilings are adorned with elaborate painted <b>stuccowork</b> and frescoes by F.V. Harovník.|$|E
50|$|Abroad, Boffrand {{worked for}} the Duke of Lorraine (not yet a part of France), where he was {{appointed}} Premier Architecte to Duke Léopold in 1711, but little of significance remains. He also constructed a fountain and a hunt pavilion, Bouchefort, in the gardens of the schloss belonging to the Elector of Bavaria, Maximilian II Emmanuel. In 1724 Boffrand worked on site at Würzburg with Balthasar Neumann, who had been consulting him in Paris, on the Prince-Bishop's Residenz (under construction 1719-1744). His designs were {{carried out in the}} main suite of rooms, where Fiske Kimball detected Boffrand's artistic control in the <b>stuccowork</b> by Johann Peter Castelli of Bonn.|$|E
50|$|The Classic Era was {{dominated}} by numerous independent city-states in the Maya region and also featured the beginnings of political unity in central Mexico and the Yucatán. Regional differences between cultures grew more manifest. The city-state of Teotihuacan dominated the Valley of Mexico until the early 8th century, but we know little of the political structure of the region because the Teotihuacanos left no written records. The city-state of Monte Albán dominated the Valley of Oaxaca until the late Classic, leaving limited records in their mostly undeciphered script. Highly sophisticated arts such as <b>stuccowork,</b> architecture, sculptural reliefs, mural painting, pottery, and lapidary developed and spread during the Classic era.|$|E
5000|$|The {{restoration}} {{project has}} taken nine years - significantly {{longer than it}} took to build {{the house in the}} first place. Every single aspect of the house from the roof down required remedial attention. Skilled craftsmen worked on the elaborate inlaid floors, repaired the gilding and the <b>stuccowork</b> or treated the stone work of the house which was disintegrating. Overseen by Jim Reynolds, the restoration project combined the conservation expertise of Purcell Miller Tritton and John J. O’Connell, Architects, who had previously been in charge of the restoration of Fota, County Cork, another house designed by the Morrisons. Woody Clark acted as Project Manager.|$|E
50|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries the {{appearance}} of the castle did not change much. Only some interior changes were preserved, and the <b>stuccowork</b> of the Knights' hall from the years around 1700 or Rococo paintings in the bedroom and in the Chinese parlour from the 1760s. Outbuildings were erected around the castle; a new Baroque chapel with fresco paintings by Francis Gregor Ignacus Eckstein from 1716 replaced the older castle chapel. The new owners had their coat-of-arms sculpted in the rock, and kept on spreading the original park. East of the barbican there is an old yew-tree connected with the tales of the foundation of the castle. Its circuit is 4.5 m and it is the oldest and biggest yew in the southern Moravian region.|$|E
