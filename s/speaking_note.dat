This is to say that the most stable energy configuration of the field constituents, (in this case magnetic atoms), may in fact be to arrange into a topology which can be described as an [...] =1 topology. Such is the case for magnetic skyrmions stabilized by the D.M. interaction, which causes adjacent magnetic spins to 'prefer' having a fixed angle between each other (energetically <b>speaking).</b> <b>Note</b> that from a point of view of practical applications this does not alter the usefulness of developing systems with D.M.I., as such applications depend strictly on the topology the skyrmions, or lack thereof, which encodes the information, and not the underlying mechanisms which stabilize the necessary topology.|$|E
40|$|PowerPoint has {{received}} much criticism regarding {{excessive use of}} text {{and the lack of}} contact with the audience. Why presenters use PowerPoint in this way has not been studied so far. Our study using interviews with beginning and advanced presenters shows that some use the program as a <b>speaking</b> <b>note</b> and as a means to draw the attention away from themselves. Some even think that PowerPoint can replace rhetorical skills. Slides are mainly designed on the basis of commonsense, instead of guidelines based on human information processing. Implications for the teaching of PowerPoint use in business communication are discussed. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{features}} of the smartphone make it an indispensible commodity of Western urban lifestyles. However, the most common problems of using a mobile device for work-related activities are limited screen space and poor input techniques. People in the workforce whose daily job entails being in a mobile environment generally prefer to carry light, mobile devices along with a pen and a notepad. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate optimal input modality for taking notes. The three modes of input evaluated were <b>spoken</b> <b>notes,</b> typing on the phone, and writing by hand using a pen and paper. The variables measured to evaluate the three modalities were accuracy of content, perceived mental task load, preferred mode, and number of words. Spoken notes were significantly more accurate, less taxing mentally, and more detailed compared to typed or handwritten notes. The difference between typed and handwritten notes was shown to be nonsignificant. However, the majority of participants preferred the typed or handwritten modality. The study shows that even though the accuracy of the spoken modality by far exceeded the rest, <b>spoken</b> <b>notes</b> are best suited for taking rough notes for personal use only...|$|R

It also became customary for officials to shield their mouths with their hu when speaking to the Emperor. The hu can be made of different material according to the holder's rank: sovereigns used jade (similar to, but not the same as, the ceremonial jade scepter gui 圭), nobles used ivory, and court officials used bamboo. Japanese shaku is usually made of woods like Japanese yew, holly, cherry, sakaki or Japanese cedar. It also became a religious instrument in Taoism and Shintoism.|$|R

They are very expressive songs dealing with emotions from passion to horror. A song for the Lord Mayor's Table was written by William Walton in 1962. This work was commissioned for special performance for the festival of the city of London. It was specially written for soprano, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and pianist, Gerald Moore. It employes many rhythmical devices to enchance to songs, such as, the voice in two-four meter and the piano in six-four meter. Also, sound effects are achieved by the vocalist through repetition of vowel sounds over an otherwise sustained line and the use of sharp accents and occasionally sharp <b>spoken</b> <b>notes.</b> The texts are by different poets and each song depicts a special scene from London life.
