5|$|Little {{can be seen}} of {{the levels}} now for the entrances were {{destroyed}} when the mine closed, but several spoil heaps remain, one covering the gill, along with the old miners’ path which zigzags up the hillside, a <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> to lower ore to the dressing floor, and the old winding-drum house. The narrow leat which once diverted water from Brownrigg Well into the gill beside the mine may also be seen, much higher up the fellside.|$|E
25|$|Six {{locomotives}} {{worked in}} the quarry. Allenby, Beatty, Haig and Trotter were based at the shed {{at the top of}} the main <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline,</b> while Ian Hamilton and Stringer were based in a shed at a higher level. Three steam navvies were used to load stone into the railway wagons, and there were nineteen or twenty steam cranes, all of which were self-propelled and ran on the tracks either in the quarry or on top of the dam. An official visit by officers of the Corporation on 5 June 1925 used motor transport to reach Scar House, but the party then made the zig-zag railway journey to cross the valley and inspect the steam generating plant, which was on the far side. They ascended the incline to Carle Fell Quarry, sitting in wagons fitted with transverse seats, and having inspected the new workings, descended again, a scene which was officially recorded by a photographer.|$|E
25|$|Completion of the Low Horse Level in the 1840s {{meant that}} new ore {{dressing}} facilities were needed {{at a lower}} level than at the old High Mill. A new Low Mill was built near the smelt mill, with a <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> to lower wagons of ore to the new mill. There it was crushed, washed, and the concentrated ore was delivered to the smelt mill. Leats from Glenridding Beck brought a plentiful supply of water to operate the machinery at the mill. Increased ore production in the 1840s also meant that the smelting capacity had to be increased. One reverberatory furnace {{seems to have been}} installed in 1844, with more in 1851. These could process much larger amounts of lead ore, but were expensive to run, consuming large amounts to coal, and needing frequent replacements of their fireclay brick linings. They were soon abandoned and a number of the simpler ore hearths were installed in 1855. Since these produced greater quantities of lead dust and fumes, the flue was extended {{at the same time to}} the new chimney.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} about 6 mi in extent, and it {{included}} two <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclined</b> planes to gain altitude in reaching {{the high ground}} where the mines were located.|$|R
25|$|It {{was first}} {{powered by a}} single engine that moved the whole 3.6 {{kilometre}} (2.2 mile) length of ropeway, but was later modified {{into a series of}} five <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Funiculars used in mines were {{sometimes}} unpowered gravity planes, {{also known as}} <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclines</b> or brake inclines. The weight of descending loaded wagons was used to pull the empty mine wagons.|$|R
2500|$|George Stephenson {{planned to}} ascend {{from the valley}} of the Murk Esk at Beckhole to the high moors at Goathland by means of a [...] long rope-worked incline at an average {{gradient}} of 1 in 15. [...] "The method of working was that of a <b>self‑acting</b> <b>incline</b> common in mines, but here, differing from the case of a mine, the load was equal each way, and so there was attached to each train a water‑tank this was filled with water {{at the top of the}} incline, and its preponderating weight as it descended pulled the other train up the hill arrived at the bottom, the water‑tank was emptied and was sent up with the next train".|$|E
2500|$|Near the Scar House dam site, {{a network}} of sidings were constructed, zig-zagging down to the Nidd, and back up {{the other side of}} the valley. A double track <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> {{provided}} access to the Carle Fell Quarry, to the north of the reservoir, and as the quarry was worked, two further inclines were constructed. One was single track, with a winding engine at the top, and around 1930, an incline worked by locomotives was added. Above the later quarry face, a Simplex petrol locomotive worked on a [...] track, removing overburden. Hydro-electric power for the works was generated using water from Angram reservoir, which was discharged into Haden Carr reservoir. A [...] pipeline supplied the turbines. This was later supplemented by a steam generating station. Two locomotive sheds were built, one near the village and another on the north side of the River Nidd, with a further two at Carle Fell Quarry. All had two tracks. Twelve four-wheeled carriages were bought from the Maryport and Carlisle Railway, to provide transport for the workers and their families from Scar House to Lofthouse, and a two-track carriage shed was built to the east of the main complex.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge is}} {{constructed}} of Old Red Sandstone, and forms a single arch, approximately 3.25 meters high, over the B4231 Road. The bridge is 6 meters wide, with high parapets, the width indicating its {{function as a}} <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> bridge, with two parallel rails running its length.|$|E
5000|$|The cost {{of working}} the <b>self-acting</b> <b>{{inclines}}</b> on the Stanhope and Tyne Railway in 1839 was £415 per mile; the inclines with stationary engines {{in the same}} period was about £485 per mile. Tomlinson, writing about the North Eastern Railway in 1903, said: ...|$|R
50|$|The quarried {{stone was}} lowered by <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclines</b> to the 3 ft (914 mm) gauge tramway which ran to jetties {{from where the}} setts were loaded into ships. After 1848 the {{majority}} of the quarry output was sent by main-line rail, although the quarry and its internal narrow gauge railway continued to operate through the nineteenth century.|$|R
50|$|The Bowes Railway {{was used}} for the {{transport}} of coal from Kibblesworth to the River Tyne at Jarrow. The line was started by George Stephenson in 1826 and extended to Kibblesworth when Robert Pit was sunk in 1842. The railway used three types of power - locomotives, stationary steam engines and <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclines.</b> There is now a cycletrack that runs along the former track bed.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, a <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> is one {{in which}} the loaded wagons going down pull, via a cable and drum, the empty wagons going up. There might be two {{separate}} tracks, or a single track with a passing loop. This system was widely used on slate railways in Wales.|$|E
50|$|By December 1861 the Directors were impatiently {{suggesting}} opening {{as much of}} {{the line}} as was ready, working it with horses, and changing to locomotives as soon as traffic warranted. On 4 February 1862 the engineer reported that the whole of the formation was completed, {{with the exception of the}} <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> at the staith at Brimspill.|$|E
5000|$|A re-inspection of {{the line}} took place on 25 June, and the opening to {{passenger}} traffic was then approved on 28 June 1877. The line opened on 2 July 1877, to a [...] "Glencross" [...] station opposite the Glencorse Barracks. The station was later renamed Glencorse. [...] There were five passenger trains daily, with first second and fourth class available. There was a <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> running from Greenlaw Colliery to Glencorse station.|$|E
50|$|Little is {{recorded}} about {{the operation of}} the Monmouth Railway. As a horse-operated plateway, and with two <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclines</b> on the line, it was overtaken by technological progress as edge railways came to be commonplace. The prospectus for the South Wales Railway issued in 1844 showed that the future included long distance locomotive-operated railways. The South Wales Railway was opened in stages from 1850.|$|R
5000|$|The eastern {{section was}} opened on 10 September 1834, {{the first public}} railway on Tyneside. Horse {{traction}} was used as well as locomotives, and in the hilly section there were inclines worked by stationary engines as well as <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclines.</b> The first consignment of coal was brought from the Medomsley collieries in a train of 100 wagons, and was loaded on a ship named [...] "Sally".|$|R
5000|$|In the 1830s {{commercial}} granite quarries {{were opened}} on Penmaenmawr {{to meet the}} growing demand for granite setts. The granite was lowered from the quarry by <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclines</b> to the [...] narrow gauge tramway which ran to jetties from where the setts were loaded into ships. The standard gauge Chester to Holyhead railway reached Penmaenmawr in 1848, after which {{the majority of the}} quarry output was sent by rail.|$|R
50|$|Little {{can be seen}} of {{the levels}} now for the entrances were {{destroyed}} when the mine closed, but several spoil heaps remain, one covering the gill, along with the old miners’ path which zigzags up the hillside, a <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> to lower ore to the dressing floor, and the old winding-drum house. The narrow leat which once diverted water from Brownrigg Well into the gill beside the mine may also be seen, much higher up the fellside.|$|E
5000|$|In 1840 George Stephenson, in {{building}} the North Midland Railway, discovered deposits of coal at Clay Cross and formed what later became the Clay Cross Company. He realised that burning lime would provide a use for the coal slack that would otherwise go to waste. He leased Cliff Quarry and built limekilns at Bullbridge. They were connected by another wagonway including a section known as [...] "The Steep", a [...] <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> at a slope of 1 in 5.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{attempts}} were made to quarry {{the south side of the}} hill for iron ore in the 19th century. Between 1861 and 1868 small amounts of iron ore were probably taken away by horse and cart. Another attempt was made between 1871 and 1874. In 1873 a <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> was constructed to take the ore to the London and North Western Railway's Market Harborough to Peterborough line. The quarry and traces of the incline remain. Further up the hill limestone was quarried from 1942.|$|E
25|$|The pit {{known as}} Wellington, renamed William in 1843, was also {{operating}} from 1843; coal was brought down from it to Lady Anne by a separate <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclined</b> plane. In 1847 no. 9 Pit was sunk, near to Lady Anne. Light parallel iron rails {{were used in}} the short branch connection. In 1850 the George Pit was sunk on the north of Cuttlehill; a standard gauge waggonway was built to connect to the nearby Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway.|$|R
50|$|Once {{raised up}} the shaft, the coal was yarded or emptied into wagons; each of 1 t capacity. Loaded wagons were run in pairs down a <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclined</b> plane railway (two loaded wagons going down hauled another two emptied ones up). They were then pushed by hand, {{assisted}} by gravity, along a graded wooden trestle. It crossed a sandy area, now occupied by Hunter Street and the Great Northern Railway, to a loading staith at which small ships could berth while coal was tipped into their holds.|$|R
50|$|The {{gradients}} {{then fell}} further towards the east, descending by <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclines</b> consisting, from west to east, of the Stanley bank (maximum gradient 1 in 21), Twizell bank (1 in 17½), Eden bank (1 in 17), and the Long Waldridge bank (1 in 20½ to 1 in 24½). The line then crossed {{the course of}} present-day East Coast main line, opened here in 1868, north of Chester le-Street. This section was level enough for locomotive working, passing through Washington and Boldon, and near Brockley Whins to reach South Shields. Running at high level through the town, the line ended at quays off Wapping Street and Long Row.|$|R
5000|$|In 1791 Benjamin Outram and Samuel Beresford {{had built}} kilns at nearby Bullbridge to process {{limestone}} from their quarry at Crich. George Stephenson had discovered deposits of coal at Clay Cross and realised that burning lime {{would provide a}} use for the slack which otherwise would go to waste. He leased Cliff Quarry at Crich, and built eight limekilns beside the railway. Within a year they had grown to twenty. They were connected by another wagonway known as [...] "The Steep", a 550 yd <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> at a slope of 1 in 5.|$|E
50|$|In {{the frenzied}} {{atmosphere}} of the Railway Mania, {{a huge number of}} railway schemes were put forward, many with little justification. The Taff Vale Railway presented a Parliamentary Bill in the 1846 session which included a proposed railway to a waterfall at Pistyll-goleu, near the present day Clydach reservoir, close to Llanwonno in the Clydach Valley. The gradients necessary to reach the chosen destination were difficult, and the technology of the day would have required operation partly by <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline.</b> The TVR already had one of these on its main line. The £59,204 estimated cost of the line and dubious benefits resulted in this scheme not progressing further.|$|E
50|$|The {{line had}} a 1 in 40 ruling gradient, {{and there were}} several {{inclined}} planes on it. Lobley Hill <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> south of Dunston was 50 chains long at 1 in 16 to 1 in 18. The Fugar (or Sunnyside) incline, also self-acting, was one mile four chains in length at a maximum of 1 in 11. At Tanfield Moor the incline was up to 1 in 9. There were three inclines worked by stationary engines: at Bowes Bridge at 1 in 40 northwards and Causey East Bank southwards at 1 in 57, worked by the same engine; There was also a more moderate Causey West Bank running northward from Tanfield East. Horse worked the intermediate sections.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} surviving {{features of the}} tramway are the elevated tramway branch at Bugsworth Basin, Stodhart Tunnel and the <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclined</b> plane at Chapel-en-le-Frith, known as the Chapel inclined plane. The elevated tramway branch forms part of the Scheduled Ancient Monument of Bugsworth Basin. It was believed that the Grade II* listed Stodhart Tunnel was the oldest railway tunnel in the world until archaeological work on the Butterley Gangroad (also in Derbyshire) in May 2013 suggested that Fritchley Tunnel on that line was older than Stodhart Tunnel. A wagon is {{on display in the}} York Railway Museum and a wheel and track items at the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum.|$|R
50|$|In 1879 the mine's {{new owners}} - who also leased and {{operated}} other quarries in Borrowdale - installed <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclines</b> to serve both the Honister and Yew Crags mines. Despite {{the cost to}} build these feats of engineering, the financial outlay proved correct as they improved efficiency in the mines. For instance the Dubbs Quarry incline allowed slate to be pulled up and then down into the valley to The Hause. Although by mid-1920s, aerial ropeways now served the Honister and Yew Crags Mines, the external Yew Crags incline proved to be so efficient it remained in use until the late 1960s. A petrol-driven narrow-gauge locomotive was {{used to make the}} connection between the Hause/slate works and the incline and short aerial ropeway. A bridge carried the railway over the Seatoller-Buttermere road. The bridge was scrapped in the early 1970s.|$|R
500|$|Details of the {{inclined}} planes {{have been}} the subject of some speculation, largely because contemporary documents from the time of their construction are unknown. A local writer called Ap Huw stated that [...] "the inclined planes were manipulated by hydraulic pumps which were considered to be great discoveries". He also noted that only two of the inclines were used, but whether this was because Hirwaunissa was unfinished or because there was no traffic on the upper section is not clear. The railway engineer W. Robinson described [...] "balance caissons with hydraulic brakes apparatus to check the barges in their descent and to arrange that the full ones coming down pull the empty ones up". The Colliery Guardian carried an eye-witness report of their operation, in which they were described as <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclines,</b> and it is stated that all three were in operation at the time.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Powell had {{extensive}} colliery interests in Monmouthshire and Glamorganshire, {{and he needed}} to get a transport link to pits he owned at Llantwit Fardre. Failing to generate interest elsewhere, he determined to build a railway himself to the Glamorganshire Canal at Maesmawr from Llantwit Fardre. This was known as the Dihewyd Railway or the Llantwit Fardre Railway. It was completed by 28 December 1843 and a connection to the Taff Vale Railway was opened on 25 April 1844, when a train of Powell's coal was taken to Cardiff. His line climbed out of Maesmawr on a 297-yard <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> at a gradient of 1 in 6.6. The line was later extended to Ystradbarwig colliery.|$|E
5000|$|George Stephenson {{planned to}} ascend {{from the valley}} of the Murk Esk at Beckhole to the high moors at Goathland by means of a 1500 yd long rope-worked incline at an average {{gradient}} of 1 in 15. [...] "The method of working was that of a <b>self‑acting</b> <b>incline</b> common in mines, but here, differing from the case of a mine, the load was equal each way, and so there was attached to each train a water‑tank this was filled with water {{at the top of the}} incline, and its preponderating weight as it descended pulled the other train up the hill arrived at the bottom, the water‑tank was emptied and was sent up with the next train".|$|E
5000|$|The railway {{was built}} between Mount Moor and Jarrow via Springwell village. The first section to open was between Springwell and Jarrow which opened on 17 January 1826, Mount Moor {{followed}} in April 1826. When the line opened it comprised four inclined planes: one steep incline from Mount Moor to Blackham's Hill, {{and one from}} Blackham's Hill to Springwell. At Blackham's Hill, the summit of both inclines, was the [...] "hauler house", housing stationary engines to wind the ropes. A long <b>self-acting</b> <b>incline</b> ran from Springwell. Nearly 5 mi of locomotive-worked line extended to Jarrow where a final incline served the coal staiths. The line was extended across the Team Valley to Kibblesworth Colliery in May 1842. The railway was completed in 1854 when a link from Marley Hill to Kibblesworth was connected enabling collieries in Dipton to be accessed.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the incline}} {{did not work}} well. [...] In 1884, the company {{chairman}} reported to shareholders that [...] "one of the greatest difficulties that had had to be overcome in working the mine had been the task of finding a competent mechanical engineer to work the incline." [...] A new engineer, Henry Hughes, was engaged {{at the end of}} 1883 and the whole system remodelled. George Binns, an Inspector of Mines, had suggested in 1883 that an ordinary endless rope system would be better than the system then being tried for lowering coal on the incline. Mr Hughes adopted this idea and altered the system into five <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclines,</b> each with an endless rope. In 1884, George Binns reported that the new inclines worked very well, but noted it was necessary to stop each incline every time a tub (truck) passed the incline terminus, causing considerable delays. He expected this would soon be resolved.|$|R
5000|$|Since 6 February 1839, the Brandling Company {{had been}} engaged in re-laying the old Tanfield Lea waggonway between the Colliery and Lobley Hill ( [...] miles) and in making a short {{connecting}} line ( [...] mile) {{between it and the}} Team branch. Leaving some of the heavier works to be finished afterwards, they began the leading of coals on 26 November 1839, employing horses on those parts of the line which were intended to be worked by stationary engines. Rising 536 feet in [...] miles and falling 90 feet in [...] miles, the line presented a series of gradients varying from 1 in 12 to 1 in 454, which involved several changes of motive power. Between Redheugh and Tanfield Lea there were three horse planes Tanfield Lea ( [...] , three engine planes Causey Wood west incline ( [...] , and two <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclines,</b> (the Lobley Hill incline ( [...] mile) with a gradient of 1 in 18 and the Fugar Bar incline or Baker’s Bank (1 mile) with gradients of 1 in 12 and 1 in 21).|$|R
5000|$|Like {{other early}} railways, it {{followed}} canal practice {{in that it}} consisted of essentially level sections linked by inclines (taking {{the place of the}} canal's locks), where the trains were drawn up and lowered down by rope. Even so, it featured some quite heavy earthworks. From a station and coal wharf alongside the Soar Navigation at West Bridge {{on the west side of}} the Fosse Way in Leicester, it headed northwards for about a mile, before passing through the [...] long tunnel at Glenfield, to the valley of the Rothley Brook. It proceeded about five miles to Desford, then swung north west towards Bagworth. The original Bagworth station was at the foot of a 1 in 29 <b>self-acting</b> <b>inclined</b> plane to the summit at 565 ft. Then the line passed through a cutting at Battleflat before reaching Bardon Hill and on to Long Lane where new collieries were opened. Beyond Long Lane the railway descended by a further inclined plane of 1 in 17 to the existing coal mines at Swannington and an end on connection with the Coleorton Tramway, which linked to further coal mines and limestone quarries. The track was to be single throughout.|$|R
