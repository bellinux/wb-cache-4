25|$|Shunting signals allow a {{train to}} move forward onto a line which may already be occupied, for example the {{platform}} of a station, a siding, or a particular road in a marshaling yard. Modern ones comprise of three lenses in a triangular formation. They may be attached to a main signal in which case they are only cleared when the <b>shunting</b> <b>movement</b> is required (known as a subsidiary signal). When cleared they display two white lights at an angle of 45° indicating that the driver may pass the signal with caution, even if the main signal is showing danger, but at a speed that allows the train to stop short of any obstruction. When not cleared these signals would be unlit, displaying nothing, and the train driver would simply obey the aspect of the main signal.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{bottlenecks}} in the logistic {{planning process}} at Netherlands Railways is {{the capacity of}} the infrastructure at the larger railway stations. To provide passenger trains with the right composition of rolling stock, many <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> between platform tracks and shunting areas are necessary, especially just before and after the peak hours. These <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> use the same infrastructure as the timetabled passenger and cargo trains. In this paper we describe a capacity test that has been developed to test at any moment during the planning process, whether {{the capacity of the}} infrastructure between the platform tracks and the shunting areas is sufficient for facilitating all the <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> that have to be planned in between the already timetabled train movements. With this test it is not necessary anymore to plan every detail of the <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> far before the actual operations. The capacity test is based on a mixed integer programming model. The running time of the Branch-and-Bound algorithm of CPLEX 9. 0 is sufficiently small, as was observed in computational experiments related to three stations in the Netherlands...|$|R
50|$|Schutzsignale = {{protection}} signals. (This section {{uses the}} terminology for West Germany, whereas ex-DR uses different names.)These signals {{used to control}} only <b>shunting</b> <b>movements,</b> but nowadays, they apply to trains as well. <b>Shunting</b> <b>movements</b> do not leave a station whereas train movements do. These signals are sometimes combined with main signals, which {{is the reason why}} main signals sometimes have one red light and sometimes two. Historically, <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> were allowed to ignore main signals. They had to stop only at main signals with two red lights, because a double red light means Hp 0 (stop for train movements) and additionally Sh 0 (stop for <b>shunting</b> <b>movements).</b> When they were allowed to pass this signal, it showed a red and two white lights, still forbidding train movements (Hp 0 + Sh 1). After a change, a red signal always means stop for all movements. Therefore, only one red light is needed (a double red has the same meaning), so single red lights will be used for new installations.|$|R

50|$|The Deutsche Bundesbahn mainly {{kept the}} H/V signalling, with colour-lights {{directly}} replacing sempahore signals; nevertheless, the signals did change their design over the years. One very early change was {{the inclusion of}} shunting signals (Sh, Schutzsignale) into the main signal's head. This affected mainly exit signals. These signals show two red lights to disallow any train or <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> and a red-white-white combination to allow <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> only. Later the subsidiary signal aspects (Zs 1, Zs 7, Zs 8), which had their own head, were also merged into the main head. Therefore, several signals, whether main, (certain types of both) subsidiary or shunting, can be merged into a common rectangular head.|$|R
50|$|A white diamond sign on {{a signal}} post {{means that the}} driver is not {{required}} to contact the signaller because a telephone is not provided, but the presence of the train or <b>shunting</b> <b>movement</b> is indicated to the signaller by detection.|$|E
50|$|DS 213 (TMS DS 134) was {{purchased}} in 1982 by PPCS {{to work at}} the Islington freezing works. It was donated to the Midland Railway Heritage Trust in 2005, and towed to the group's base at Springfield by a special <b>shunting</b> <b>movement.</b> It is painted in the PPCS livery of red and white, and has been fitted with a strobe light on top of the cab roof.|$|E
50|$|Dwarf {{signals are}} usually {{positioned}} {{on the left}} of the tracks and only apply to that track. In case it is positioned on the right hand side of the track it has an illuminated indicator (arrow) to make clear for which track it is valid. They are set to allow the passage of trains as well as the standard light signals for mainline movements. The last dwarf signal before entering the main line will show a Proceed aspect for a train or a Proceed with caution aspect for a <b>shunting</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E

50|$|The variant KLUB-P (КЛУБ-П) is {{restricted}} to cab signaling without track safety equipment. It is only used in category-II trains (including special cars and <b>shunting</b> <b>movements).</b> The variant KLUB-UP (КЛУБ-УП) is allowed for category-I trains (including passenger transport) where it replaces the cab signaling of ALSN.|$|R

25|$|Masterton is {{a unique}} {{signalling}} arrangement with Track Warrant Control ending at 'TWC Ends' boards north of the two-position home signal, which allows <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> {{to be carried out}} without the need for a Track Warrant. Along with Horotiu (on the NIMT between Te Rapa and Ngaruawahia) Masterton still has Woods Points Keys. The Horotiu ones are not in regular use.|$|R
25|$|For steam-hauled trains, the Llanberis <b>shunt</b> <b>movement</b> {{includes}} {{a trip to}} the water crane and coaling stage outside the locomotive shed. At Halfway Station steam locomotives also take water from a water crane, fed from a large tank located just above the station. For emergency use another large water tank is situated near Clogwyn Station which can feed two water cranes.|$|R

50|$|The {{reversals}} (including {{change of}} locomotives) {{in the early}} 1980s took at least six minutes and required numerous shunting movements; up to 3000 <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> were counted at Mannheim Hauptbahnhof each day. These circumstances led to frequent delays. The reversal of the trains required all station tracks to be crossed. The Western Entrance to the Riedbahn project was developed to resolve these problems.|$|R
50|$|The station {{originally}} was an island platform. In October 1990, the eastern platform was decommissioned, later being filled in and redeveloped {{as a coach}} stop. The Murwillumbah line branches off immediately North of the station, although {{it has not been}} used since 2004, the track is still in place and a short distance at Casino is used for occasional <b>shunting</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... as {{semaphore}} signal: A white {{circle with}} a black line horizontally across it, mounted on a black box. It means Fahrverbot (literally [...] "movement forbidden"), and all train and <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> must stop short of it. These signals are still in use by mechanical signal boxes. 'Black box' indicators fixed at aspect Sh 0 are commonly found mounted on buffer stops.|$|R
50|$|The MKB is a co-user of the Zehlendorf Railway {{in its own}} right. Rail services, as {{on other}} museum {{railways}} is not {{carried out by the}} MKB, operations are limited to <b>shunting</b> <b>movements.</b> Nevertheless, visitors may ride on the vehicles on the museum site. Each year in September the activities and progress with the society's work are exhibited to the public at an open day.|$|R
50|$|After a {{few years}} of operation, two {{additional}} guard's vans, four sitting and two sleeping cars were added to the fleet. These would have allowed a consist of two sleeping, four sitting and four vans, including one acting as the guard's van. It is possible that one guard's van may have been placed {{at either end of the}} train, to provide some degree of noise insulation and simplify <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> at either end to and from the yards.|$|R
5000|$|Heathfield station. This was {{originally}} named Chudleigh Road, and was renamed from 2 October 1882. The line from Exeter via Chudleigh terminated {{here in a}} north-east facing bay platform; it was only connected for <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> until 2 October 1916, when a running connection was provided; it was made a full double junction from May 1943. The intention {{was to make the}} Chudleigh route a diversionary route if the Dawlish route should become blocked by enemy action.|$|R
50|$|The Railway {{is fully}} {{operated}} by volunteers. These volunteers {{come from all}} walks of life and have diverse and varied interests within the railway. Trackwork enthusiasts can lead a hand on a Wednesday work train, however the majority of work occurs on Saturdays where activities range from <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> to engineering. Complimentary training is offered in both correspondence form, and through one-on-one and group lecturing. No fees occur (except for the issue of steam locomotive firemans and drivers certificate, assessed by an external examiner) for these services.|$|R
50|$|Cleaner: Based {{aboard the}} locomotive, taking {{direction}} from engine driver to ensure safe {{operations of the}} train, assisting with piloting and <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> (including coupling and uncoupling operations), completing the preparation and presentation of the operating locomotive, taking direction from the fireman (in most cases cleaners will be either preparing to begin training, or be under training to become qualified firemen) {{during the course of}} operations - particularly in resupply of coal and water, assisting with the shutting down and cleaning of the locomotive {{at the end of the}} operating day etc.|$|R
40|$|In this note, we prove NP-completeness of the {{following}} problem: Given a set of trams of different types, which are stacked on sidings in their depot and an order in which trams of specified types are supposed to leave. Is there an assignment of trams to departure times without any <b>shunting</b> <b>movements?</b> For the special case where the number of sidings is fixed the problem is solvable in polynomial time. We derive a brute force and a more sophisticated implementation of the associated algorithm. Furthermore, we compare the implementations on random and real word data...|$|R
5000|$|In 1987 {{the engine}} was {{classified}} as a minor locomotive (Kleinlok) and reclassified. Class 260 became Class 360 and the 261s became 361s. Its categorisation as a Kleinlok saved staff costs, because the railway {{no longer had to}} employ [...] "engine drivers", only [...] "Kleinlok operators", whose training was cheaper. The installation of radio control enabled one-man <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> using remote control; the fully radio controlled models were called the Class 364 (light class) or 365 (heavy class), however the only loco in Class 364 was soon renumbered to 365 700.|$|R
50|$|If a {{locomotive}} fails, {{it can be}} easily replaced with minimal <b>shunting</b> <b>movements.</b> There would {{be no need for}} passengers to evacuate the train. Failure of a multiple unit will often require a whole new train and time-consuming switching activities; also passengers would be asked to evacuate the failed train and board another one. However, if the train consists of more than one multiple unit they are often designed such that in the event of the failure of one unit others in the train can tow it in neutral if brakes and other safety systems are operational.|$|R
50|$|Tawa Flat {{station was}} {{equipped}} with crossovers, a loop, and a siding. A miniature lever frame in the new Tawa Flat station building gave local control of the signalling to allow trains to be passed using the crossing loop, to control <b>shunting</b> <b>movements,</b> and to allow trains to terminated at Tawa Flat and returned to either Wellington or Porirua. As Tawa Flat {{was the end of}} the track duplication it was a manned station to allow trains to be switched to the single track and to allow tablets to be issued for the single track section to Porirua.|$|R
50|$|Rothley {{station was}} built partly {{in a cutting}} {{at the north end}} (across which the bridge 354 crosses) and on an {{embankment}} at the south end. A modest goods yard with a goods shed, weigh bridge and coal store were provided {{on the east side of}} the station, with train and <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> controlled from a signal box a little to the south of station on the west side of the main running lines. A station master's house at the north eastern corner of the site watches over the station from on top of the banks.|$|R
50|$|With these locomotives, {{there was}} some concern about water supply. The {{capacity}} of the tender was limited at only 6200 imp gal and, with few watering points in service, the full capacity of the locomotive was not always used for fear of running short of this essential commodity in the semi-arid Spanish landscape. For example, for the 163 km stretch between Medina del Campo and Burgos that rises 131 m with an uphill start, three intermediate stops, one slack and some <b>shunting</b> <b>movements</b> to couple extra coaches to the train, {{the amount of water}} consumed was about 7300 imp gal.|$|R
