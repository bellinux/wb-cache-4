5|$|In 1913, {{representative}} William J. Hughes of Whatcom County {{proposed the}} formation of a commission to adopt the state flag, consisting of the Governor, <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> <b>and</b> Adjutant General. Governor Ernest Lister became a supporter of the idea, issuing a call for designs from the state's citizens and city organizations. The campaign for a state flag, however, was opposed by patriotic groups like the Sons of the American Revolution and Sons of Veterans, finding the use of a state flag to be detrimental to the national flag.|$|E

5|$|Congress created {{executive}} departments during Washington's {{first months}} in office in 1789, including the State Department on July 27, the Department of War in early August, and the Treasury Department on September 2. The President also received two additional officers without departments: the Attorney General and Postmaster General. Washington appointed Richmond lawyer Edmund Randolph as Attorney General and Samuel Osgood as Postmaster General. He also appointed fellow Virginian Thomas Jefferson to be <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> Henry Knox as Secretary of War. Finally, he appointed Alexander Hamilton to head the Treasury Department. Washington's cabinet eventually developed into a consultation and advisory body, although this was not mandated by the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Desha's {{trial began}} January 17, 1825, in Cynthiana. William K.

Rowan, {{who had just}} been elected to the U.S. Senate, was Desha's primary defense counsel, assisted by the governor's <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> (<b>and</b> later U.S. Senator) William T. Barry, former Congressman William Brown, T. P. Taul, and James Crawford. It took two days to empanel a jury. Witness testimony consumed the next week, and Governor Desha attended each day of the trial. The closing statements of Rowan and Barry, both known as outstanding orators, took several days, and Chambers spoke last.|$|E
5|$|Following Mary's childless death, her {{half-sister}} Elizabeth {{inherited the}} throne. One {{of the most}} important concerns during Elizabeth's early reign was religion. Elizabeth could not be Roman Catholic, as that church considered her illegitimate. At the same time, she had observed the turmoil brought about by Edward's introduction of radical Protestant reforms. Communion with the Roman Catholic Church was again severed by Elizabeth. She relied primarily on her chief advisors, Sir William Cecil, as her <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> <b>and</b> Sir Nicholas Bacon, as the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, for direction on the matter. Chiefly she supported her father's idea of reforming the church but made some minor adjustments. In this way, Elizabeth and her advisors aimed at a church that included most opinions.|$|E

5|$|In February 1799, Adams {{surprised}} many {{by sending}} diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France. Napoleon, {{realizing that the}} conflict was pointless, signaled his readiness for friendly relations. At the Convention of 1800, the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and {{to allow for the}} peaceful transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation. The Treaty of Alliance of 1778 was superseded and the United States was then free of foreign entanglements, as Washington had advised in his farewell address. Adams brought in John Marshall as <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> demobilized the emergency army. Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process.|$|E
5|$|John Rowan (July 12, 1773July 13, 1843) was a 19th-century {{politician}} and jurist from the U.S. state of Kentucky. Rowan's family moved from Pennsylvania to the Kentucky frontier {{when he was}} young. From there, they moved to Bardstown, Kentucky, where Rowan studied law with former Kentucky Attorney General George Nicholas. He was a representative to the state constitutional convention of 1799, but his promising political career was almost derailed when he killed {{a man in a}} duel stemming from a drunken dispute during a game of cards. Although public sentiment was against him, a judge found insufficient evidence against him to convict him of murder. In 1804, Governor Christopher Greenup appointed Rowan <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> <b>and</b> he went on to serve in the Kentucky House of Representatives and the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, followed in order of succession by the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> the Attorney General. Prior to the current constitution, {{the duties of the}} office would devolve upon the lieutenant governor, without that person actually becoming governor. The term begins at noon on January 1 of the year following the election. Prior to the 1963 constitution, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected through separate votes, allowing them to be from different parties. In 1963, this was changed, so that votes are cast jointly for a governor and lieutenant governor of the same party.|$|E

5|$|The Tyler-Texas {{treaty was}} in its final stages when its chief architects, Secretary Upshur and Secretary of the Navy Thomas W. Gilmer, died in an {{accident}} aboard USS Princeton on February 28, 1844, just a day after achieving a preliminary treaty draft agreement with the Texas Republic. The Princeton disaster proved a major setback for Texas annexation, in that Tyler expected Secretary Upshur to elicit critical support from Whig and Democratic Senators during the upcoming treaty ratification process. Tyler selected John C. Calhoun to replace Upshur as <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> to finalize the treaty with Texas. The choice of Calhoun, a highly regarded but controversial American statesman, risked introducing a politically polarizing element into the Texas debates, but Tyler prized him as a strong advocate of annexation.|$|E

However, the meeting with Dulles turned into a farce after the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> his subordinates decided to visit Diá»‡m at Blair House.

5|$|Two {{successive}} inquiries {{failed to}} find evidence against Clayton. The legislature refused to continue, all charges were dropped, and Clayton was exonerated. In fact, he was never found guilty of any wrongdoing while governor. Finally a deal was reached. Johnson, now politically badly damaged by his impeachment ordeal and willing to take any position he could get, resigned as lieutenant governor, was appointed <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> <b>and</b> was given a compensation of several thousand dollars for his loss of power and prestige, since he would not become governor. A staunch Clayton supporter, O.A. Hadley, was then appointed lieutenant governor. Three days later, Clayton left the state for Washington, D.C., to join the US Senate, and Hadley succeeded him as governor.|$|E

5|$|Tyler {{appointed}} Abel P. Upshur, {{a popular}} Secretary of the Navy and close adviser, as his new <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> <b>and</b> nominated Gilmer to fill Upshur's former office. Tyler and Upshur began quiet {{negotiations with the}} Texas government, promising military protection from Mexico {{in exchange for a}} commitment to annexation. Secrecy was necessary, as the Constitution required congressional approval for such military commitments. Upshur planted rumors of possible British designs on Texas to garner support among Northern voters, who were wary of admitting a new pro-slavery state. By January 1844 Upshur told the Texas government that he had found a large majority of senators in favor of an annexation treaty. The republic remained skeptical, and finalization of the treaty took until the end of February.|$|E
5|$|With his own {{campaign}} at a close, Crittenden resumed direction of Taylor's presidential campaign, dispatching accomplished Whig speakers to {{all parts of}} the country. After Taylor was elected, he offered Crittenden the post of Secretary of State. Appeals came in from both Whig and Democratic leaders across the country urging him to serve in the cabinet; Taylor was inexperienced, and many felt that without Crittenden to guide him, his administration would fail. Taylor personally visited Crittenden in Frankfort on February 15, 1849, in hopes of persuading him to accept the appointment. Crittenden refused Taylor's overtures, and Taylor similarly rejected Crittenden's appeals to appoint his friend, Robert P. Letcher, as Postmaster General. Crittenden's input is believed to have contributed significantly to the appointments of John M. Clayton as <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> Orlando Brown as Commissioner of Indian Affairs.|$|E
5|$|Historian James C. Klotter has speculated that, had John C.

Burdened with her husband's debts, widow Mary Breckinridge and her {{children}} moved to her in-laws' home near Lexington, Kentucky, where John C. Breckinridge's grandmother taught him the political philosophies of his late grandfather, U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge. John Breckinridge believed {{the federal government was}} created by, and subject to, the co-equal governments of the states. As a state representative, he introduced the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 and 1799, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts and asserted that states could nullify them and other federal laws that they deemed unconstitutional. A strict constructionist, he held that the federal government could only exercise powers explicitly given to it in the Constitution.|$|E
