5|$|Turner {{writes that}} the two most {{prominent}} opponents of military integration (brassage) were Colonel Jules Mutebusi, a Munyamulenge from <b>South</b> <b>Kivu,</b> and Laurent Nkunda, a Rwandaphone Tutsi who Turner says was allegedly from Rutshuru in North Kivu. In May–June 2004 Mutebusi led a revolt against his superiors from Kinshasa in <b>South</b> <b>Kivu.</b> Nkunda began his long series of revolts against central authority by helping Mutebusi in May–June 2004. In November 2004 a Rwandan government force entered North Kivu to attack the FDLR, and, it seems, reinforced and resupplied RCD-Goma (ANC) at the same time. Kabila despatched 10,000 government troops to the east in response, launching an attack which was called 'Operation Bima.' In {{the midst of this}} tension, Nkunda's men launched attacks in North Kivu in December 2004.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the intervention, Tshombe lost the support of Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu and was {{dismissed}} from his post as prime minister in October 1965. Soon after Dragon Rouge, ANC and mercenary troops captured Stanleyville putting an end to the Simba rebellion. Pockets of Simba resistance continued to hold out in the eastern Congo, most notably in <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> where Laurent-Désiré Kabila led a Maoist cross-border insurgency which lasted until the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Kagame first {{provided}} {{troops and}} military training to aid a rebellion against Zaire by the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi group living near Bukavu in the Zairian <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> province. With Rwandan army support, the Banyamulenge defeated local {{security forces and}} began attacking the Hutu refugee camps in the area. At the same time, Kagame's forces joined with Zairian Tutsi around Goma to attack two of the camps there. Most refugees from the attacked camps moved to the large Mugunga camp. In November 1996 the Rwandan army attacked Mugunga, causing an estimated 800,000 refugees to flee. Many returned to Rwanda {{despite the presence of}} the RPF; others ventured further west into Zaire.|$|E

5|$|Many {{efforts have}} also been made to promote guinea pig {{husbandry}} in developing countries of West Africa, where they occur more widely than generally known because they are usually not covered by livestock statistics. However, {{it has not been}} known when and where the animals have been introduced to Africa. In Cameroon, they are widely distributed. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they can be found both in peri-urban environments as well as in rural regions, for example, in <b>South</b> <b>Kivu.</b> They are also frequently held in rural households in Iringa Region of southwestern Tanzania.|$|E
5|$|To {{assist the}} new government, since February 2000 the United Nations {{has had the}} United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (now called MONUSCO), which {{currently}} has a strength of over 16,000 peacekeepers in the country. Its principal tasks are to provide security in key areas, such as the <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> and North Kivu in the east, and to assist the government in reconstruction. Foreign rebel groups {{are also in the}} Congo, as they have been {{for most of the last}} half-century. The most important is the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), against which Laurent Nkunda's troops were fighting, but other smaller groups such as the anti-Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army are also present.|$|E
5|$|By late 1996, Hutu militants {{from the}} camps were {{launching}} regular cross-border incursions, and the RPF-led Rwandan government launched a counteroffensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi {{group in the}} Zairian <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> province, helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the Banyamulenge, and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked the refugee camps, targeting the Hutu militia. These attacks caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} refugees to flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north western provinces. By 1999, a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the national army succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.|$|E
25|$|Ugandan and Rwandan forces within Congo {{began to}} battle {{each other for}} territory, and Congolese Mai Mai militias, most active in the <b>South</b> and North <b>Kivu</b> provinces (in which most {{refugees}} were located) {{took advantage of the}} conflict to settle local scores and widen the conflict, battling each other, Ugandan and Rwandan forces, and even Congolese forces.|$|R
50|$|Orientale (French: Province orientale) (also Oriental; {{formerly}} Haut-Zaïre, then Haut-Congo) {{is one of}} {{the eleven}} former provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The province laid in the northeast of the country. It bordered Équateur to the west, Kasaï-Oriental province to the southwest, Maniema to the <b>south,</b> and North <b>Kivu</b> to the southeast. It also bordered the Central African Republic and South Sudan to the north, and Uganda to the east. The provincial capital is Kisangani.|$|R
50|$|The Nyungwe {{rainforest}} {{is located}} in southwestern Rwanda, at the border with Burundi, to the <b>south,</b> and Lake <b>Kivu</b> and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west.

It {{is located in}} the watershed between the basin of the river Congo to the west and the basin of the river Nile to the east. From {{the east side of the}} Nyungwe forest comes also one of the branches of the Nile sources.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{agreement}} and subsequent ceasefire, relations between Kagame and the Congolese government have remained tense. A 2003 United Nations report alleged that Rwanda was using demobilised soldiers {{to continue its}} illegal exploitation of Congolese minerals. Meanwhile, Kagame blamed Kabila for failing to suppress Hutu rebels in North and <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> provinces. Two major insurgencies {{have occurred in the}} eastern provinces: the first, from 2005 to 2009, was led by Congolese Tutsi Laurent Nkunda, while the second, carried out by the March 23 Movement (M23) under leader Bosco Ntaganda, began in 2012; Ntaganda gave himself up to the International Criminal Court in early 2013, and peace talks have taken place, but as of May 2013 the conflict is at risk of resuming. Human Rights Watch alleges that both insurgencies were supported by Rwanda, a charge Kagame denies. A leaked United Nations report in 2012 also alleges Rwandan support for M23; this report cites Kagame's defence minister James Kabarebe as being effectively the commander of the movement.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his primary}} reason for {{military}} action in Zaire was {{the dismantling of the}} refugee camps, Kagame also began planning a war to remove long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based in the camps, and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Kagame supported the newly created Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL), an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The ADFL, helped by Rwandan and Ugandan troops, took control of North and <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> provinces in November 1996 and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting. By May 1997, they controlled almost the whole of Zaire except for the capital Kinshasa; Mobutu fled and the ADFL took the capital without fighting. The country was renamed as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Kabila became the new president. The Rwandan Defence Forces and the ADFL were accused of carrying out mass atrocities during the First Congo War, with as many as 222,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees declared missing.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to dismantling the refugee camps, Kagame began planning {{a war to}} remove long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based in the camps, and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with Uganda, the Rwandan government supported an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The rebels quickly took control of North and <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> provinces and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting, and controlling the whole country by May 1997. Mobutu fled into exile, and the country was renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Rwanda fell out with the new Congolese regime in 1998, and Kagame supported a fresh rebellion, leading to the Second Congo War. This war lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and massive damage. A 2010 United Nations report accused the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the two Congo wars, charges denied by the Rwandan government.|$|E
40|$|Angular {{leaf spot}} (Pseudocercospora griseola Crous U, Brown) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} diseases hindering common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) production in the Great Lakes Region of Africa, including the Democratic Republic of Congo. The disease causes extreme yield losses, estimated at 384. 2 tonnes per year, in Sub-Saharan Africa. Little is known about the distribution, severity and incidence of the disease and the effect of agronomic practices and environmental factors on the disease prevalence in the country to facilitate interventions. A field survey was conducted during two crop seasons, February to June and September to January, in two main beans growing zones of eastern DRC namely; sub-humid highland and sub-humid mid altitude at low latitudes, in <b>South</b> and North <b>Kivu,</b> respectively. Severity and incidence of angular leaf-spot and other occurring diseases were assessed on common bean plants in farmers’ fields. Angular leaf spot in these fields had an average severity index (PSI) of 49. 9 %. PSI was significantly different (P< 0. 05) between districts and seasons. Using multiple regression analysis, independent variables: growth stage, cropping system, districts and altitude were shown to have significant influence on the observed PSI (P< 0. 05) with R 2 = 96. 2 %. The highest severity (PSI= 59. 7 %) was observed in Kabare district, and the lowest in Uvira district (PSI= 39. 5 %). Screening of a set of 37 released common bean varieties in DRC using virulent Andean and Mesoamerican isolates identified four resistant bean varieties; ARA 4, COD MLV 059, MLV 224 / 94 B, LSA 144 and Mexico 54. Some of these varieties possess useful traits, in addition to acceptable seed market class, and are hence recommended as suitable parents for ALS resistant variety development and promotion in ALS prone environments.

40|$|The eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has {{experienced}} constant instability and conflict since 1996. With {{the collapse of}} the state of Zaire and the renaming of the country by the late Laurent Desire Kabila in late 1996, there were high expectations from the Congolese population that the country was going to move forward. However, in less than two years, the central government in Kinshasa was facing a new rebellion from the east of the country, followed by widespread violence and criminal activities by armed and militia groups. Although military intervention from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola halted the rebellion march to Kinshasa, the capital city of DRC, and allowed the DRC government to sign peace agreement with its opponents in 2002; since then, the prospect of peace in the eastern DRC, especially the North and South Kivus seems bleak. Since 2002, that region has been the theatre of armed and militia groups (both local and foreign), owing to, in the views of various experts, the presence of mineral resources to support their criminal activities, as well as the economic interests of regional actors to create proxy militia and armed groups in the absence of central government in much of eastern DRC. The purpose and rationale {{of this study is to}} critically identify actors in the postconflict reconstruction process, and examine the role of mineral resources among other perpetuating factors of the protracted conflict in eastern DRC, in order to arrive at a comprehensive analysis of the reasons for the failure of peace building and post-conflict reconstruction processes that have been undertaken. This study aims to fill a gap in available literature, by pointing to some conflict drivers and factors which have previously been overlooked in post-conflict reconstruction, and in existing research on the topic, especially the role of mineral resources in sustaining conflict. A thorough conceptualization of relevant conflict theory and a historical overview of the conflict in DRC were provided as a point of departure in order to understand other factors that contribute to the intractability of conflict in eastern DRC, this study found that those factors were rooted in the legacy of colonialism; the bad leadership under both the colonial powers and subsequent government of Joseph Mobutu, manipulation and politicization of ethnic identities especially in the <b>South</b> and North <b>Kivu</b> and the geopolitical location of the eastern DRC. This study further established that the presence of mineral resources in eastern DRC indeed contributes to the continued insecurity in that region by providing succour to armed groups, thus undermining peace agreements especially the Pretoria agreement that formally ended hostilities in 2002. Furthermore, the study found that the issue of mineral resources is not the sole driver of the eastern DRC conflict, as the issues of ethnic polarisation especially, discrimination against Kinyarwanda speaking Congolese in the east, and the view that only military means can solve this problem; coupled with other security threats including the presence of foreign militia groups motivate the neighbouring countries of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi to constantly meddle in DRC's internal affairs. The study suggests that additional research be conducted to further investigate the regional dimensions of the conflict and how perceived interests in mineral revenue contribute to the polarisation of the population in eastern DRC; leading to the proliferation of armed groups...|$|R
5|$|The {{reform plan}} adopted in 2005 envisaged the {{formation}} of eighteen integrated brigades through the brassage process as its first of three stages. The process consists firstly of regroupment, where fighters are disarmed. Then they are sent to orientation centres, run by CONADER, where fighters take the choice of either returning to civilian society or remaining in the armed forces. Combatants who choose demobilisation receive an initial cash payment of US $110. Those who choose {{to stay within the}} FARDC are then transferred to one of six integration centres for a 45-day training course, which aims to build integrated formations out of factional fighters previously heavily divided along ethnic, political and regional lines. The centres are spread out around the country at Kitona, Kamina, Kisangani, Rumangabo and Nyaleke (within the Virunga National Park) in Nord-Kivu, and Luberizi (on the border with Burundi) in <b>South</b> <b>Kivu.</b> The process has suffered severe difficulties due to construction delays, administration errors, and the amount of travel former combatants have to do, as the three stages' centres are widely separated. Following the first 18 integrated brigades, the second goal is {{the formation of}} a ready reaction force of two to three brigades, and finally, by 2010 when MONUC is anticipated to have withdrawn, the creation of a Main Defence Force of three divisions.|$|E
25|$|Local {{authorities}} in North and <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> Provinces routinely required travelers to present official travel orders from an employer or transitional government official.|$|E
25|$|Armed groups outside {{government}} control committed numerous serious abuses, especially {{in rural areas}} of North and <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> provinces, northern Katanga Province, and Ituri District.|$|E
25|$|Mai Mai militia {{groups in}} the provinces of Katanga, <b>South</b> <b>Kivu,</b> and North Kivu {{continued}} to commit abuses against civilians, including killings, abductions, rapes, and child soldier recruitment.|$|E

25|$|MONUC {{reported}} that ANR officers in Kalemie and Lubumbashi, Katanga Province, and Uvira, <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> Province, {{made more than}} 30 arrests for political reasons and mistreated and tortured some of the detainees who were members or supporters of political parties. There were no reports of authorities taking action against those responsible for these actions.|$|E
25|$|The FDLR, largely {{made up of}} Rwandan Hutus {{who fled}} to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1994 after the Rwandan genocide, {{continued}} to be led by individuals responsible for executing and fomenting the genocide. Between 8,000 and 10,000 FDLR fighters and their families remained in the eastern provinces of North and <b>South</b> <b>Kivu.</b> Several hundred opted to voluntarily demobilize and return to Rwanda during the year.|$|E
25|$|Internal {{conflict}} {{continued in}} rural and mineral-rich {{parts of the}} east, particularly in Ituri District, northern Katanga province, and the provinces of North Kivu and <b>South</b> <b>Kivu.</b> Unlike in the previous year, there was no confirmation of reports of Rwanda or Uganda providing material support to armed groups that operated and committed human rights abuses in the country, or {{of the presence of}} Rwandan soldiers in the country.|$|E
25|$|Security forces {{recruited}} {{children and}} used them as soldiers during the year although the exact number was not known. In March MONUC identified 22 children among soldiers of the Fifth Integrated FARDC Brigade in Katanga Province.
