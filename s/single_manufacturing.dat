2500|$|In law, [...] "chemical {{substances}}" [...] {{may include}} both pure substances and mixtures with a defined composition or manufacturing process. For example, the EU regulation REACH defines [...] "monoconstituent substances", [...] "multiconstituent substances" [...] and [...] "substances of unknown or variable composition". The latter two consist of multiple chemical substances; however, their identity {{can be established}} either by direct chemical analysis or reference to a <b>single</b> <b>manufacturing</b> process. For example, charcoal is an extremely complex, partially polymeric mixture that can be defined by its manufacturing process.

50|$|Saraswat {{has worked}} on {{modeling}} of CVD of silicon, conduction in polysilicon, diffusion in silicides, contact resistance, interconnect delay, and oxidation effects in silicon. He pioneered the technologies for aluminum/titanium layered interconnects, which became an industry standard, as well as CVD of MOS gates with alternative materials such as tungsten, WSi2, and SiGe. During the late 80's he focused on <b>single</b> wafer <b>manufacturing</b> and developed equipment and simulators for it. Jointly with Texas Instruments a microfactory for <b>single</b> wafer <b>manufacturing</b> was demonstrated in 1993. Since the mid 90's, Saraswat {{has worked on}} technology for scaling MOS technology to sub-10 nm regime and pioneered several new concepts of 3-D ICs with multiple layers of heterogeneous devices.

We provide necessary conditions and sufficient {{conditions for the}} optimality of Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing, and further show that the necessary and sufficient conditions coincide when the negative buffer costs for all the parts are equal. In general, finding optimal hedging policies for multiple part-type problems is extremely difficult. We provide bounds on the optimal hedging points, and also prove that, under an optimal hedging policy, the buffer levels will be upper bounded. 1 Introduction We consider the following model of a failure-prone <b>single</b> machine <b>manufacturing</b> system producing N part-types. Under the assumption that set-up times are negligible, the dynamics of x i (t), the buffer level of part-type i at time t, satisfy the following differential equation: dx i dt = u i (t) Î“ d i; i = 1; ::::; N; (1. 1) where d i is the constant demand rate for part-type i and u i is the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} we study the multi-product Economic Lot Scheduling Problem (ELSP) with manufacturing and remanufacturing opportunities. Manufacturing and remanufacturing operations are {{performed on the}} same production line. Both manufactured and remanufactured products have the same quality thus they fulfil the same demand stream. Tang and Teunter (2006) firstly studied this type of Economic Lot Scheduling Problem with Returns (ELSPR) and presented a complex algorithm for the optimal solution. More recently Teunter, Tang, and Kaparis (2009) proposed several heuristics {{to deal with the}} same problem using more computational efficient approaches. However, both studies have limited the attention to the common cycle policy with the assumption that a <b>single</b> (re) <b>manufacturing</b> lot is used for each item in each cycle. Relaxing the constraint of common cycle time and a <b>single</b> (re) <b>manufacturing</b> lot for each item in each cycle, we propose a simple, easy to implement algorithm, based on Segerstedt (1999), to solve the model using a basic period policy. Several numerical examples show the applicability of the algorithm and the cost savings. Funding Agencies|Italian Ministry of Research and Higher Education||</p...|$|R
