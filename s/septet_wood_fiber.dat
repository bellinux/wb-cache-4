40|$|Coupling {{agents in}} <b>wood</b> <b>fiber</b> and polymer {{composites}} (WFPC) {{play a very}} important role in improving the compatibility and adhesion between polar <b>wood</b> <b>fibers</b> and non-polar polymeric matri-ces. In this paper, we review coupling agents, pretreatment, and mixing technology for <b>wood</b> <b>fiber</b> and polymer currenrly used in the manufacture of WFPC. So far, over forty coupling agents have been used in production and research. These agents are classified as organic, inorganic, and organic-inor-ganic groups, among which organic agents are better than inorganic agents because of stronger inter-facial adhesion. The most popular coupling agents currently being used include isocyanates, anhy-dridcs, silanes, imd anhydride-modified copolymers. Coupling agents are usually coated on the surface o i <b>wood</b> <b>fiber,</b> polymer or both by compounding, blending, soaking, spraying, or other methods. Three basic processes suitable for coupling treatment are discussed: directly coating during mixing and fully or partly pretreating before mixing. The pretreatment of <b>wood</b> <b>fiber</b> and polymer by coating or grafting is the preferred method to improve the mechanical properties of WFPC. 2 Kuvwords: Coating, coupling agents, grafting, polymer, thermoplastic matrix, WFPC, <b>wood</b> <b>fiber.</b> INTRODUCTION fiber as filler in a polymer matrix, and pressin...|$|R

Superiority of hybrids over their parents ranged from 36.3 % to 41.6 % for diameter, from 20.0 % to 25.3 % for height, from 6.9 % to 20.7 % for specific gravity, and from 6.1 % to 12.8 % for <b>wood</b> <b>fiber</b> length.
