Model building (or simulation) using such representations will be numerically unstable near such limits in consequence.

We show that these difficulties are overcome by using a new shifted Cartesian representation which characterizes the entire stable law family in a completely continuous way. Standardization is still possible with this representation so that tabulation, using just two bounded parameters, can be carried out. Its use is illustrated in a non-regular threshold estimation problem involving <b>stable</b> <b>distributions</b> which are discontinuous limits in conventional representations...|$|R

Consistent with their role as <b>stable</b> <b>distributions,</b> power <b>laws</b> have frequently been proposed to model such datasets. However there are physical situations that require distributions with finite means. Such situations may call for power laws with high-end cutoffs. Here, I present a maximum-likelihood technique for determining an optimal cut-off power law to represent a given dataset. I also develop a new statistical test of the quality of fit. Results are demonstrated for a number of benchmark datasets. Non-power-law datasets can frequently be represented by power laws, but this is a trivial result unless the dataset spans a broad domain. Nevertheless, I demonstrate that there are non-power-law distributions, including broad log-normal distributions, whose tails can be fit to power laws over many orders of magnitude. Therefore, caution is called for whenever power laws are invoked to represent empirical data...|$|R

We apply the tamed laws to calculate certain familiar queuing properties, such as the transform of the stationary distribution of the long-run virtual waiting time and mean thereof. We show that, by norming or scaling traffic intensity, waiting times, and other measures of congestion, we can obtain bona fide limiting distributions as the underlying service times become untamed, i. e. return to the wild.

40|$|We develop Bayesian {{methods for}} right censored multivariate failure time data for populations with a cure fraction. We propose a new model, called the multivariate cure rate model, {{and provide a}} natural {{motivation}} and interpretation of it. To create the correlation structure between the failure times, we introduce a frailty term, which is assumed {{to have a positive}} <b>stable</b> <b>distribution.</b> The resulting correlation structure induced by the frailty term is quite appealing and leads to a nice characterization of the association between the failure times. Several novel properties of the model are derived. First, conditional on the frailty term, it is shown that the model has a proportional hazards structure with the covariates depending naturally on the cure rate. Second, we establish mathematical relationships between the marginal survivor functions of the multivariate cure rate model and the more standard mixture model for modelling cure rates. With the introduction of latent variables, we show that the new model is computationally appealing, and novel computational Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are developed to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Specifically, we propose {{a modified version of the}} collapsed Gibbs technique (J. S. Liu, 1994, J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 89, 958 - 966) to sample from the posterior distribution. This development will lead to an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure, which would otherwise be extremely difficult.

The random normalization used {{in the definition of}} discrete stability is applicable for continuous random variables as well.
