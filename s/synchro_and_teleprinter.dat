5000|$|Telephone system: modern local, interisland, and {{international}} (wire/radio integrated) public and special-purpose telephone, telegraph, <b>and</b> <b>teleprinter</b> facilities; regional radio communications center; telephone or radio telephone links to almost all inhabited islands; most towns and large villages have automatic telephone exchanges and direct dialing; combined fixed and mobile-cellular teledensity roughly 100 per 100 persons (2011).|$|R
5000|$|SATTS, {{a legacy}} of Morse <b>and</b> <b>teleprinter</b> systems (see [...] "Background," [...] below), has {{historically}} been employed by military and communications elements of Western countries for handling Arabic text {{without the need for}} native fonts or special software. Although its use has decreased in recent years with the demise of Morse code and the obsolescence of the <b>teleprinter,</b> <b>and</b> with the increased availability of native-font software, it is still used for the quick and handy platform-independent recording and transmission of Arabic terms and text.|$|R
5000|$|Collins Radio Company {{produced}} the AN/TRC-80 Radio Terminal Set {{specifically for the}} Pershing system. The [...] "Track 80" [...] used an inflatable dish antenna to provide line-of-sight or tropospheric-scatter voice <b>and</b> <b>teleprinter</b> communications between missile firing units and higher headquarters. The erector-launcher, PTS, PS and RTS could {{be removed from the}} carriers and air-transported in fourteen CH-47 Chinook loads.|$|R

50|$|Communications {{underpin}} {{the artillery}} system, {{as it must}} be reliable and available in real-time. During the 20th century communications often used flags, morse code by radio, line and lights (which could include voice <b>and</b> <b>teleprinter,</b> {{to name a few}} contrivances). Radio has included HF, VHF, satellite and radio relay as well as modern tactical trunk systems. In western armies radio communications are now usually encrypted.|$|R
5000|$|All BzRFuZ {{were given}} the {{designation}} [...] "A1" [...] prefixed by the respective provincial code number, for example, the Totenstein near Karl-Marx-Stadt was designated as 14A1. In the mid-1960s, the NVA joined the system with their own narrowband radio relay network. Both systems were only communication networks over which telephone <b>and</b> <b>teleprinter</b> circuits were operated. The towers in these networks were not used for surveillance.|$|R
50|$|The 2007 World Aquatics Championships or the XII FINA World Championships {{were held}} in Melbourne, Australia from 17 March to 1 April 2007.

5|$|Early {{means of}} {{communicating}} over a distance included visual signals, such as beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs. Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, and loud whistles. 20th and 21st century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies, such as telegraph, telephone, <b>and</b> <b>teleprinter,</b> networks, radio, microwave transmission, fiber optics, and communications satellites.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{commissioned}} in July 1943, {{and at the}} peak period of the war had an establishment of about 150 personnel, of whom more than eighty were women. Tens of thousands of code groups were handled each day, mostly for the British Pacific Fleet in Japanese waters. A dozen or more circuits were manned simultaneously <b>and</b> <b>teleprinter</b> land lines fed the signals to the Navy Office in Wellington.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, Makanec {{established}} the Multimedia Center of the Zagreb University Referral Center (MMC). The MMC {{was an open}} type computer center intended {{to be used for}} non-numerical purposes. The MMC was equipped with a Hewlett-Packard HP 2000 Time-Sharing BASIC system, computer terminals, <b>and</b> <b>teleprinter.</b> The MMC, during nearly twenty years of existence, gave thousands of children and students an opportunity to learn programming and socialise with people of similar interests.|$|R

50|$|The Trampolining {{competition}} for the 2014 Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships was held on 10 April to 12 April 2014 at the Richmond Olympic Oval. The juniors and seniors competed together in the team final but competed separately for the <b>synchro</b> <b>and</b> individual competition. The synchro competition was held on 10 April, the individual and team competitions were held on 11 April, and finals were held on 12 April.|$|R
25|$|Long-running {{regional}} affairs program The Country Hour {{began in}} December, 1945. The ABC's coverage of rural affairs was significantly {{enhanced by the}} deployment of journalists and 'extension officers' to major country areas. The increasing availability of landlines <b>and</b> <b>teleprinters</b> allowed the organisation to gather and broadcast news and other program material with much greater efficiency {{than in the previous}} two decades. By this time, as many as 13 national news bulletins were broadcast daily.|$|R
5000|$|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma {{enabled the}} western Allies in World War II to read {{substantial}} amounts of secret Morse-coded radio communications of the Axis powers that had been enciphered using Enigma machines. This yielded military intelligence which, along with that from other decrypted Axis radio <b>and</b> <b>teleprinter</b> transmissions, was given the codename Ultra. This was considered by western Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower to have been [...] "decisive" [...] to the Allied victory.|$|R
50|$|The new NX {{series is}} {{announced}} which includes 45 - 60HP Cab models available with <b>Synchro</b> Shuttle <b>and</b> Hydrostatic Transmissions.|$|R
50|$|A {{surfaced}} submarine can use ordinary radio communications. Submarines may use naval frequencies in the HF, VHF and UHF ranges (i.e. bands), {{and transmit}} information via both voice <b>and</b> <b>teleprinter</b> modulation techniques. Where available, dedicated military communications satellite systems are preferred for long distance communications, as HF may betray {{the location of}} the submarine. The US Navy's system is called Submarine Satellite Information Exchange Sub-System (SSIXS), a component of the Navy Ultra High Frequency Satellite Communications System (UHF SATCOM).|$|R
