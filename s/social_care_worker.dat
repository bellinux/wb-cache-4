40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on the Professional Identity Formation (PIF) of Social Care Workers. The {{timespan}} of the research coincided with the progression towards registration and regulation of Social Care as a profession in its own right in Ireland. The starting point of the study was with the lived professional experience of the workers themselves. Particular emphasis was placed on the written and verbal discursive practices encountered by, and engaged in, by the <b>Social</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Worker.</b> A core aim of the research was to gain a deeper understanding of how PIF occurs, and by doing so, to better understand the emerging profession at a critical time in its evolution. Under a broad Social Constructionist banner, a theoretical framework based on Rhetorical Genre Theory and Enactment Theory was constructed that informed an approach to data collection and analysis in which the voice of the worker was central. The twin-theory approach allowed deeper contextual analysis of the individual worker’s experiences. The Collective-Case Study approach facilitated a greater breadth of experiences to be included. The data-gathering instruments of ‘Conversational Interviewing’ and ‘e-Diaries’ ensured that the newly qualified workers were active participants in generating the data. The ‘within-case’ analysis emphasised the individual voice of the worker, and themes emerging there fed forward to the cross-case analysis that followed. Nvivo ™ qualitative analysis software was used to assist the analytical process. Three key themes emerged to frame the cross-case analysis: 1. Policy, power and ‘situated’ professional identity. 2. Worker Activity in context - professional identity as a socially constructed concept. 3. Workers Self Awareness - professional identity as an internalised construct. The conclusions of the research are expressed as five ‘meaningful points’ that look inward to the research data and outward towards implications for professional practice.

40|$|A {{high rate}} of growth in {{population}} ageing combined with a low fertility rate has led to significant demographic changes in Japan. It is projected that one third of population will be aged sixty-five or over by 2050. The ageing population raises concerns regarding health and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> for the elderly, including fears about the shortage of Japanese workers in these sectors. In 2007, Japan included within an 'Economic Partnership Agreement' (EPA) an intention to allow Filipino nurses and other <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> to work in Japan and subsequently signed parallel agreements with Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. This {{was the first time}} in Japan's history that the government made a formal agreement to allow the deployment of migrant health and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> in Japan. This thesis will reveal the complex drivers behind Japan's acceptance of migrant nurses and care givers through EP As. It will also investigate the conflicts between different policy stakeholders, as theses reflect the context in which Japan's immigration policy is responding to population ageing and the commercialisation of health and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> labour in East Asia. Firstly, this thesis will argue that the desire to conclude economic and trade treaties, rather than the need for health and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> labour, has been the driving force for Japan's acceptance of migrant health and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> from Southeast Asia. Second, it will argue that disputes over the acceptance of migrant health and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> have been managed through restricted implementation mechanisms - such as training and professional licensing system - and that this provides a method for exploiting the cheap labour of migrant workers and controlling them on a temporary basis. Lastly, the policy of accepting migrant nurses and caregivers through EPAs reveals the contradictions between Japan's desire to maintain its restrictive immigration policy and the need to address the implications of population ageing as well as to respond to the pressure exerted from labour exporting countries in the region to open its borders to their health and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Most {{research}} {{to date on}} implicit gender stereotyping has been conducted with one age group – young adults. The mechanisms that underlie the on-line processing of stereotypical information in other age groups have received very little attention. This is the first study to investigate real time processing of gender stereotypes at different age levels. We investigated the activation of gender stereotypes in Italian in four groups of participants: third- and fifth-graders, young and older adults. Participants heard a noun that was stereotypically associated with masculine (preside headmaster) or feminine (badante <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>worker)</b> roles, followed by a male (padre father) or female kinship term (madre mother). The task was to decide if the two words – the role noun and the kinship term – could describe the same person. Across all age groups, participants were significantly faster to respond, and {{significantly more likely to}} press ‘yes’, when the gender of the target was congruent with the stereotypical gender use of the preceding prime. These findings suggest that information about the stereotypical gender associated with a role noun is incorporated into the mental representation of this word and is activated as soon as the word is heard. In addition, our results show differences between male and female participants of the various age groups, and between male- and female-oriented stereotypes, pointing to important gender asymmetries...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the role of}} the <b>Social</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Worker</b> in interventions into unacceptable sexual behaviour in people who have a learning disability. It takes as point of departure ways in which support organisations and individual members of staff become aware that a service user’s sexual behaviour needs to be addressed. This raises issues about the service user’s human rights, confidentiality, and the concept of {{what it is to be}} ‘professional’ which can affect information sharing between support organisations and also between fellow support workers. In the case of the latter this relates to the workers status within the organisation, relations of power/knowledge which also has implications for the status of these workers as ‘professionals’. The thesis goes on to determine the support workers’ perceptions of what Bourdieu has termed, their ‘field’. That is to say, those behaviours they feel they can address without consulting health professionals. In addition to this, criteria used to decide when it is appropriate to consult health professionals is also described which thus demarcates their ‘field’ as perceived by the social care workers. The subsequent roles of the SCW whether working with or without input of health professionals is then discussed in terms of the individual worker’s ‘proximity’ or working relationship with the service user in question, and also their status within the support organisation. Findings suggest that some front-line workers who can claim closer ‘proximity’ to the service user may not have the same level of information about the behaviour as their managers who work off-site and do not have their direct care. Consideration is then given to accounts of situations in which input from health professionals is sought but is not forthcoming leaving SCWs and their organisations to deal with the behaviour in-house. Some of these such as sexual assault and rape are thus being treated in the community when otherwise the individuals concerned would be treated in locked NHS wards. Thus a new ‘field’ emerges requiring of the SCW a level of responsibility and skill that goes unacknowledged. The thesis ends by considering the feelings of workers involved in interventions into unacceptable sexual behaviour and concludes with recommendations on the education and support these workers require. Acknowledgement of the work they do and re-assessment of their status as workers is also recommended...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In France, {{the access}} to {{treatment}} has become a priority and a right. Hence, the supply of care has been reorganised {{in order to improve}} the management of the health scourges for all the patients, whether they can pay for what they need or not. The free delivery of drugs (FDD) is part of the services offered by the public hospitals for the low income patients or those who do not yet benefit from social security coverage. As such, it is inscribed {{within the context of the}} right to treatment and is a corner stone to a new mission of the public hospital services and care networks. METHOD: The polyclinic of the Max Fourestier hospital is one of hospitals in the Paris area that supplies medical and surgical consultations to the population and provides drugs free of charge. From April 1, 1999 to the end of June 2000, all the FDD were studied for all the non-hospitalised outpatients who came to the consultations with a prescription for drugs, which could not be supplied in a pharmacy because of lack of revenues or social security coverage. RESULTS: The diseases encountered in the context of FDD were the same as those of the general population. No specificity was revealed in the prescriptions related to vulnerability. If it were necessary, this would confirm the fact that the management of persons in difficulty should be integrated in the provisions of common rights. The treatments concerned were essential, and for some persons life saving, and justifying the interest of FDD without which the health of these individuals would rapidly decline. Furthermore, this study shows the need for careful management of FDD in order to avoid the anarchical and uncontrolled delivery of several prescriptions, source of deleterious drug interactions and iatrogenia. This is the reason for the recommendation to all the staff delivering free drugs that they systematically ask the patients to meet a referring physician and contact the hospital pharmacist when necessary. COMMENTS: The FDD request is an ideal occasion for a physician to meet the patient and, because of the professional secrecy, to learn more of the patient's life style, and reveal, other than the diseases, the patients risk factors or elements of vulnerability that interact with the general state of health. The access to rights, on the occasion of FDD, is a fundamental public health strategy, since it provides the patient with access to preventive and primary care health measures. This is why we propose that FDD, other than the medical consultation, become systematically coupled with a consultation with a <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>worker,</b> to permit the rapid return of the patients to their common rights. CONCLUSION: Free drug delivery should not be conceived as a traditional pharmaceutical delivery, it should be the pretext for the reintegration of persons to their social rights and with a strategy of improved medical care. Organised in this manner, FDD is a precious tool for access to care and prevention, but also to the construction of a social relationship...|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{experiences}} of a sample of residential <b>social</b> <b>care</b> staff working with young people who self injure. Initially, a phone survey was conducted with residential centres caring for young people aged between 12 - 18 years located in Dublin, to identify centres where self injury had occurred within the twelve months prior to data collection in February 2008. Questionnaires were then sent to the centres where confirmed self injury had occurred and follow up interviews were thereafter conducted with ten residential <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers.</b> Each of the workers interviewed {{had been involved in}} managing the most recent incident of self injury in their centres.

40|$|In Ireland, the {{austerity}} era {{of recent}} years brought (un) employment to the fore in a manner {{not seen since the}} 1980 s. Within the arena of health and <b>social</b> <b>care,</b> this was epitomised by the embargo. Confined within an embargo process, recruitment agencies became a first choice response to maintaining service delivery in a deepening recessionary period. Located against this backdrop, this study explored agency-working arrangements in <b>social</b> <b>care</b> through the use of semi-structured interviews with service provider managers (n= 3) and agency <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> (n= 6). Analysed using a variation of conventional content analysis; these interviews reveal a central tension between the flexibility afforded by agency working arrangements and the instability that such arrangements can foster. Although flexibility and variety in agency based employment arrangements can be beneficial for service providers, and in certain stages of career development for <b>social</b> <b>care</b> practitioners, underlying tensions arise within such working arrangements, which have a particular resonance for the <b>social</b> <b>care</b> profession. Most notably, the relationship based nature of <b>social</b> <b>care</b> practice can be disturbed by a restructuring of traditional employment pathways, especially in relation to continuity of care and practitioner support and development. Nonetheless, the findings also reveal that the extent of disruption is being dampened by adaptions to the agency process by service provider managers and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> through a pooling approach to agency staffing.

40|$|This {{research}} project {{sets out to}} explore, analyse and theorise the way district nurses and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> construe their identity, and their relationships within the changing context of collaborative projects. Unlike previous research in this field, this project offers an alternative, relational view of exploring professional identities and inter-professional relationships. The research adopted a constructivist phenomenological approach drawing upon the theories of personal construct psychology (Kelly, 1955) and existential phenomenology (Merleau Ponty, 1962), as elaborated by Butt (2004, 1998). The project consists of three studies. The first empirical work is a preliminary study using individual interviews of students undertaking degree courses in community nursing or social work. This study is concerned with examining the students' concepts {{of what it means}} to belong to a particular occupational group and the influences that shape their ideas. Using focus groups and individual interviews, the second study explores how district nurses and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> negotiate their identity as a result of national changes and service developments. The final study explores interprofessional relationships of individual district nurses and <b>social</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers,</b> using reflective interview techniques (Hargreave, 1979, Salmon, 2003). In keeping with phenomenological methodology, data was analysed using template analysis (King, 2004). A number of emerging constructs were identified that highlight the personal, historical and contextual influences upon professional role construction and inter-professional relationships, notably: visibility and recognition, role flexibility and rigidity. In particular the findings illustrate how professional identity is constructed, challenged, and reconstructed, through on-going interaction. To facilitate role re-construction and sociality, the reflective interview techniques were adapted and extended to encourage practitioners to reflect upon their every-day practice and relationships when working in a multi-disciplinary setting.
