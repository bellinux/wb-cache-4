40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} failure of a rocker arm shaft of a {{passenger}} car. The shaft failed by brittle fracture across one of the four <b>holes</b> <b>supporting</b> the shaft into the cylinder head. The running distance of the engine just before failure was 40, 626 km. Visual examinations of etched sections of the failed shaft and a new one revealed four distinct zones of darker etching appearance. These zones correspond to the four locations where the rocker arms fit the shaft. Microscopic observations of the failed shaft revealed that the four dark-etching areas are surface hardened zones of martensitic microstructure. Furthermore, scanning the microstructure along the failed shaft showed that the heat treatment was so mistakenly extended by excessive heating so that the structure of the shaft near the <b>supporting</b> <b>holes</b> contains considerable content of martensite phase. This conclusion has been confirmed by the results of hardness measurements along the surface of the shaft. Microscopic investigations of the failed shaft revealed the presence of microcracks close to the <b>supporting</b> <b>holes.</b> These cracks may have been induced in the shaft by the non-uniform cooling during quenching in the course of heat treatment, or may be nucleated by repeated loading during service. This premature failure has occurred by the rapid crack propagation because of the lower fracture toughness of the martensite...|$|R

40|$|Network Address Translation (NAT) {{presents}} well-known difficulties to {{all forms}} of peer-to-peer (P 2 P) network communication, because the peers involved may not be reachable at any globally valid IP address. Several NAT traversal techniques are known, but their documentation is slim, and data about their robustness or relative merits is even slimmer. This paper documents and analyzes one of the simplest but most robust and practical NAT traversal techniques, commonly known as “hole punching. ” Contrary to what its name might suggest, hole punching does not compromise {{the security of a}} private network, as long as the NAT implements the standard firewall policy of dropping unsolicited incoming traffic. Hole punching is moderately well-understood for UDP communication, but we show how it can be reliably used to set up peer-to-peer TCP streams as well. After gathering data on the reliability of this technique {{on a wide variety of}} deployed NATs, we find that about 76 % of the NATs tested <b>support</b> <b>hole</b> punching for UDP, and about 61 % <b>support</b> <b>hole</b> punching for TCP streams.

Progress requires the development of modified PNA duplexes having unique and well defined properties. We find that anthraquinone groups bound to internal positions of a PNA oligomer intercalate in the PNA–DNA hybrid. Their irradiation with near-UV light leads to electron transfer and oxidative damage at remote GG doublets on the complementary DNA strand. This behavior mimics that observed in related DNA duplexes and provides the first evidence for long range electron (hole) transport in PNA–DNA hybrid.

The first two material in particular, dictate where the maximum interface shear stress occurs between the loaded and supported fibre ends.

40|$|The {{singular}} behaviour at {{the free}} {{edges of the}} fibre-matrix interface is analysed for the fibre push-out test geometry based on the boundary element method. The fibre push-out test has been extensively {{used to measure the}} fibre-matrix interfacial properties in polymer, ceramic and metal matrix composites. There are two free edges in the fibre push-out specimen: one is at the loaded fibre end and the other at the supported fibre end. The singular stresses can be expressed as a function of singular exponent and singular stress intensity. It is shown that the singular exponents obtained at both fibre ends are characteristic of composite constituent properties, such as Young's moduli of fibre and matrix, and does not vary with specimen dimensions. The singular exponents are real and identical for the shear and radial stress components at fibre ends where the wedge angles are the same. The singular stress intensities are also implicit in material properties, and vary with specimen dimensions, such as fibre to matrix radius ratio, fibre aspect ratio and <b>support</b> <b>hole</b> size. An interfacial failure criterion is proposed here based on the average stress concept to determine the critical singular stress intensities in mode I and mode II loads...|$|R
