25|$|Campese {{played in}} the one-off Bledisloe Cup Test in 1989 between Australia and New Zealand. The Test, which Australia lost 12-24, {{contains}} a Campese try. Australia's eightman Steve Tuynman took the ball {{from the back of}} a scrum and passed the ball to Nick Farr-Jones. Farr-Jones passed the ball to Campese, who <b>stepped</b> <b>around</b> John Kirwan causing him to slip over. Campese then passed to Farr-Jones who had looped him. As Farr-Jones and Campese were running down the sideline, and with Farr-Jones about to be tackled into touch, Campese pointed forwards signalling Farr-Jones to kick the ball forwards. Farr-Jones executed a grubber kick. Campese and All Blacks inside centre John Schuster were engaged in a sprint towards the ball. As Schuster tried to dive on the ball, Campese was able to kick the ball forwards and fall upon it.|$|E
25|$|With about {{a minute}} left in the round, Chávez hit Taylor {{squarely}} with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Chávez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Chávez back ahead of him. Suddenly Chávez <b>stepped</b> <b>around</b> Taylor, positioning him so that Taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from Chávez' desperate final flurry. Chávez then nailed Taylor with a tremendous right hand that dropped the younger man. By using the ring ropes to pull himself up, Taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. Referee Richard Steele asked Taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but Taylor failed to answer. Steele then concluded that Taylor was unfit to continue and signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a TKO victory for Chávez with only two seconds to go in the bout.|$|E

Some called him Tom Sawyer the Traveler, and that just swelled him up fit to bust. You see he laid over me and Jim considerable, because we only went down the river on a raft and came back by the {{steamboat}}, but Tom went by the steamboat both ways.

6000|$|... "You're {{all right}} now," [...] said Lucy, soothingly. Slowly she reached a hand toward his head. He drew it {{back as far}} as he could. She <b>stepped</b> <b>around,</b> closer, and more back of him, and put a hand on him, gently, for an instant. Then she slipped out of the brush and, untying one lasso from the pommel, she {{returned}} to the horse and pulled it from round his legs. He was free now, except the hackamore, and that rope was slack. Lucy stood near him, watching him, talking to him, waiting for him to get up. She could not be sure he was not badly hurt till he stood up. At first he made no efforts to rise. He watched Lucy, less fearfully, she imagined. And she never made a move. She wanted him to see, to understand that she had not hurt him and would not hurt him. It began to dawn upon her that he was magnificent.|$|E

"Then {{he cocked}} his head down and took another look; he glances up {{perfectly}} joyful, this time; winks his wings and his tail both, and says, 'Oh, no, this ain't no fat thing, I reckon!

So he flew down and got that acorn, and fetched it up and dropped it in, and was just tilting his head back, with the heavenliest smile on his face, {{when all of a sudden}} he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded gradually out of his countenance like breath off'n a razor, and the queerest look of surprise took its place. Then he says, 'Why, I didn't hear it fall!' He cocked his eye at the hole again, and took a long look; raised up and shook his head; <b>stepped</b> <b>around</b> to the other side of the hole and took another look from that side; shook his head again. He studied a while, then he just went into the Details--walked round and round the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass. No use. Now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and scratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute, and finally says, 'Well, it's too many for ME, that's certain; must be a mighty long hole; however, I ain't got no time to fool around here, I got to [...] "tend to business"; I reckon it's all right--chance it, anyway.' ...|$|E
