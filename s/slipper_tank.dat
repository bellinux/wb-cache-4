2500|$|The JetStar has {{a fairly}} typical {{business}} jet design layout, with a swept wing and a cruciform tail. The wing has a 30° sweepback and features large fuel tanks at about half-span, extending some distance {{in front and}} behind the wing. [...] The wings hold 10,000 pounds of fuel, and each <b>slipper</b> <b>tank</b> holds 4,000 pounds of fuel for a total fuel load of 18,000 pounds. [...] The wing also includes leading edge flaps (not slats) along {{the front of the}} wing outboard of the tanks (these leading edge flaps reduce the stalling speed by an additional three knots), while double-slotted trailing edge flaps span the entire rear surface inboard of the ailerons. [...] The wing incorporates inflatable rubber deicing boots for the removal of accumulated inflight ice. The horizontal stabilizer is mounted nearly halfway up the fin to keep it clear of the engines' jet blast. One feature is that the horizontal stabilizer is trimmable by pivoting the entire tail fin and stabilizer assembly, which has a distinctive unpainted area {{at the base of the}} fin that is noticeable in most pictures. The JetStar does not have any tail deicing capability, nor was it required for certification. [...] A speed brake is located on the underside of the fuselage to aid deceleration for landing. The original prototypes used a tricycle landing gear with one wheel per leg, but after an accident in 1962 the nose gear was modified with two tires.|$|E
50|$|To {{protect the}} engine inlets, another wire ran diagonally from the {{nose to the}} <b>slipper</b> <b>tank</b> on each wing.|$|E
50|$|To reduce low-frequency (70 MHz) {{reflections}} {{from the}} leading and trailing {{edges of the}} wings, a wire was placed parallel to and ahead of each wing's leading edge and another parallel to and behind each wing's trailing edge. To anchor the outboard end of each wire, a fiberglass pole was attached to each wingtip to give anchor points ahead and behind the wings. Each wire then ran from the front end of each pole to the <b>slipper</b> <b>tank</b> (which projected in front of the wing) and from the <b>slipper</b> <b>tank</b> to the fuselage. Behind each wing, a wire ran from the back end of the fiberglass pole to the fuselage. The horizontal stabilizer was treated in a similar manner.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first two}} prototypes were {{equipped}} with two Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engines, {{the first of}} these flying on 4 September 1957. The second of these was also equipped with the wing-mounted [...] "slipper tanks", which was originally to be an option. Lockheed attempted to arrange a contract to produce the Orpheus in the US, but when these negotiations failed it re-engined the second prototype with four Pratt & Whitney JT12s in 1959. The <b>slipper</b> <b>tanks</b> were removed and placed on the first prototype. The JT12 fit proved successful and was selected for the production versions, the first of which flew in mid 1960. These versions entered commercial service in 1961.|$|R

5000|$|Under German rule all Czechoslovak {{aircraft}} were {{absorbed into}} the Luftwaffe - and the huge Czechoslovak manufacturing base was converted to produce German aircraft and engines. After {{the end of the}} war in late 1945 four Czechoslovak RAF squadrons, Numbers 310, 311, 312, and 313 were all dispatched to Czechoslovakia and became part of the Czechoslovak armed forces. The Aircraft issued to the Czechoslovak Air Force after the war were not initially Migs but Supermarine Spitfire MK9. All of which were flown back by the centrally amalgamated 313 squadron comprising all Free Czechoslovak Air Force squadrons which had been supplied with off the production line Newly built Spitfires MKIX. The newly Equipped group was flown back from England with Long range <b>Slipper</b> <b>tanks</b> fitted. These Spitfires were the primary fighters for the Postwar Czechoslovak air force before the 1948 Communist Putsch which ultimately removed all wartime serving Czechs from the air force placing them into prison camps or forced labour, some managed to escape and return to England.

40|$|A {{laminar flow}} control (LFC) flight test article was {{designed}} and fabricated {{to fit into the}} right leading edge of a JetStar aircraft. The article was designed to attach to the front spar and fill in approx. 70 inches of the leading edge that are normally occupied by the large <b>slipper</b> fuel <b>tank.</b> The outer contour of the test article was constrained to align with an external fairing aft of the front spar which provided a surface pressure distribution over the test region representative of an LFC airfoil. LFC is achieved by applying suction through a finely perforated surface, which removes {{a small fraction of the}} boundary layer. The LFC test article has a retractable high lift shield to protect the laminar surface from contamination by airborne debris during takeoff and low altitude operation. The shield is designed to intercept insects and other particles that could otherwise impact the leading edge. Because the shield will intercept freezing rain and ice, a oozing glycol ice protection system is installed on the shield leading edge. In addition to the shield, a liquid freezing point depressant can be sprayed on the back of the shield...|$|R
5000|$|Model years: 2009 - Present.The V-Rod Muscle was {{introduced}} in the summer of 2008 at the Harley-Davidson dealer show in Las Vegas for the 2009 production model year. In promoting the Muscle, American fashion model Marisa Miller was hired for an advertising campaign aimed at younger, urban riders. [...] It would be one of only three VRSC models for 2009. Like the other two models, the Muscle used the [...] Revolution Engine, a 240 mm wide rear tire, [...] fuel <b>tank,</b> <b>slipper</b> clutch and forward controls. Unlike the other models in the VRSC lineup, the Muscle had straight shot dual exhausts, with a crossover, one {{on each side of the}} bike, unlike the 2>1>2 exhaust found on all other VRSC models. Additionally, the Muscle used an air-box with mock-up air-rams like those found on many American pony and muscle cars. In the production version of the bike the air-rams are cosmetic. The VRSCF also had a chopped rear fender with integrated turn signals, and a side-mounted license plate. Turn signals were integrated into the rear view mirrors for the first time as a stock feature on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. The VRSCF provided at the crank a claimed [...] of torque at 6,500 rpm, which was slightly more torque than the other VRSC models, at a slightly lower engine speeds. Claimed peak crank horsepower was slightly lower than the Night Rod Special, at [...] at 500 rpm lower engine speed.|$|R
