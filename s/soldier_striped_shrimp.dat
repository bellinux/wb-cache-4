This project should include some activities for the valorisation and promotion of this new shellfish product, as well as for scientific-technical and social divulgation, and for giving advice to the decision-makers. Lastly, with the aim of developing a new fishing activity in the Cape Verdes on a responsible and sustainable basis, authors have scheduled a second study phase. This should consist of a process of technology transfer, followed by an experimental fishing pilot project including a study on biological and commercial viability with the participation of the Capeverdian fishing sector...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} part of the PROACTIVA 1 - 2 (2009 - 2012) and MARPROF-CV (2010 - 2014) projects, in the {{framework}} of the Canary Islands Government and UE PCT MAC 2007 - 2013 programmes respectively. Research has mainly focused on the stock assessment of the <b>striped</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Plesionika edwardsii (Brandt, 1851), because it has shown moderate to high levels of fishing yield and abundances compatible with {{the development of a new}} sustainable fishery in the Cape Verde Islands. Cruises took place on board the R/V Prof. Ignacio Lozano. Four 15 -day surveys have been conducted to date: Cabo Verde 2010 - 04 (April 2010), Camar˜ao- 1 (November 2011), Camar˜ao- 2 (Mars 2012) and Camar ˜ao- 3 (July 2012). An innovative fishing gear so-called multiple semi-floating shrimp trap (MSFST) was used. Each fishing line was composed by 40 - 65 traps operating around 2. 4 m above the seafloor, using Decapterus macarellus (Carangidae) as unique bait of the traps. Fishing depth was 66 - 458 m, and efective fishing time was 16 - 18 h. Each trap was attached to the main bottom line every 15 m, and the maximum attraction of this bait was established to be 100 or 150 m, according to the experience gained from the local fishery for deep-sea lobsters. So density by area was calculated assuming two different areas of attraction of the fishing gear. Initial biomass was estimated from depletion experiments at different abundance stations by applying the Leslie & Davis (1939) method, modified by Ricker (1975). Each fishing operation was classified according to its yield (CPUE in g/trap/night). The potential fishing planar area was estimated between the isobathymetric lines between 90 and 220 m. Total biomasses (Bt) were calculated from areas (km 2) and mean minimum/maximum densities (kg/km 2). Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated from Bt using the Beddington and Cooke (1983) model by entering natural mortality (0. 6), growth rate (0. 53 year� 1) and recruitment age (1. 32 year), which are the parameters for this target species published for the Canaries. These parameters estimate a biological exploitation rate () of 0. 262. Interpolations were applied to estimate MSY for insular stocks representing lesser than 5 % of the total fishing grounds for this species in the archipelago. The MSY estimated by depletion were 30. 5 tons/year for the stock of S˜ao Vicente, Santa Luzia, Ilheus and S˜ao Nicolau, 10 tons/year for the stock of Santiago, 138. 8 tons/year for the stock of Boa Vista and Maio, and 5. 6 tons/year for the stock of Sal. The small stocks estimated by interpolation were: 4. 5 tons/year for the stock of Santo Ant˜ao, 1. 3 tons/year for the stock of Fogo, and 1. 8 tons/year for the stock of Brava and Ilheus. In total, 192. 5 tons per year was the total MSY for the <b>striped</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>shrimp</b> around the islands of the Cape Verde archipelago, occupying a total area of 1, 918 km 2 of new fishing grounds at between 90 and 220 m of depth. In comparison with the traditional bottom trap used in the Canary Islands, the innovative fishing gear MSFST were proved to be more selective for pandalid shrimps, minimizing the gear impact on the seafloor as well as the by-catch by reducing the discards. Depletion methods are based on the assumption of a closed system, that is with minimum or zero immigration between neighbouring areas. The straight forward decline of CPUEs obtained during the depletion experiments seems to confirm that P. edwardsii is a low mobility species, making this assumption valid at least during short-time periods. Because of the bathymetry profile of these islands,the depth range is from very close (few nautical miles in Santiago) to far away (10 - 12 n. m. in Boa Vista) to the coastline. Fishing effort should be controlled on the basis of quotas, number of fishing vessels and a precautionary approach in order to ensure that catching is commensurate with sustainable levels of exploitation. MSY estimates suggest that this new Capeverdean fishery should be carried out by specialized medium-sized fishing vessels. During the last decades a combination of shrimp trawling and industrial trapping activity has threatened over-exploitation in the Mediterranean fisheries targeting on P. edwardsii; currently the shrimp collapse has conducted to the decline of these fisheries.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that discards and overexploitation produced by intense fishing activities {{are not only}} a risk for fisheries sustainability but also {{the cause of the}} marine resources decline, this involving significant changes in the trophic webs and habitats. This is especially the case of bottom trawl fisheries, and more specifically shrimp trawls, which produce average discards that can be higher than 70 % of catches. A Spanish shrimp fishery has been traditionally developed in West African fishing grounds, being especially relevant in Mauritanian waters, due to their high productivity. Since 2010, discards produced by this fishery have been studied from the information obtained through a “Program of scientific observers onboard” carried out by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO). Two annual observation cycles (2010 and 2014) have been conducted in Mauritania, giving information on catches and discards from a total of 996 (2014) and 1143 hauls (2010). More than 250 species were identified in the discards produced by this fleet. Cluster analyses and multidimensional scaling (MDS) revealed the occurrence of three well-defined assemblages, related to the depth fishery of the three main target species: one coastal shelf assemblage, in fishing depths of the southern pink shrimp Penaeus notialis (30 - 60 m depth), one slope assemblage in fishing depths of the deep-water rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris (90 - 300 m) and a deep slope assemblage in fishing depths of the <b>striped</b> red <b>shrimp</b> Aristeus varidens (300 - 900 m). The structure of each assemblage is presented in this work. Quantifying the bycatch and discard and identifying the main species are key steps to address a solution to effectively reduce their effects and to maintain healthy marine ecosystems.

In later years, the indulgence of using the colour should only be granted as a reward, after it has shown care and progress in its drawings with pencil. A limited number of good and amusing prints should always be within a boy's reach: in these days of cheap illustration he can hardly possess a volume of nursery tales without good woodcuts in it, and should be encouraged to copy what he likes best of this kind; but should be firmly restricted to a few prints and to a few books. If a child has many toys, it will get tired of them and break them; if a boy has many prints he will merely dawdle and scrawl over them; it is by the limitation of the number of his possessions that his pleasure in them is perfected, and his attention concentrated. The parents need give themselves no trouble in instructing him, as far as drawing is concerned, beyond insisting upon economical and neat habits with his colours and paper, showing him the best way of holding pencil and rule, and, so far as they take notice of his work, pointing out where a line is too short or too long, or too crooked, when compared with the copy; accuracy being the first and last thing they look for. If the child shows talent for inventing or grouping figures, the parents should neither check, nor praise it. They may laugh with it frankly, or show pleasure in what it has done, just as they show pleasure in seeing it well, or cheerful; but they must not praise it for being clever, any more than they would praise it for being stout. They should praise it only for what costs it self-denial, namely attention and hard work; otherwise they will make it work for vanity's sake, and always badly. The best books to put into its hands are those illustrated by George Cruikshank or by Richter. (See Appendix.) At about the age of twelve or fourteen, it is quite time enough to set youth or girl to serious work; and then this book will, I think, be useful to them; and I have good hope it may be so, likewise, to persons of more advanced age wishing to know something of the first principles of art.|$|R

Sustainability in aquaculture is receiving increasing attention, and this issue is not only the concern of government, but also stakeholders participating in the value chain. Therefore, this study aims to identify sustainability issues of farmed seafood by assessing the main sustainability issues raising concern. The Global Value Chain framework described by Gereffi et al. (2005) is applied for this study to explore the business relationships in supply chain and the perceptions of sustainability concerned by the value chain actors. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was used to collect data. An assessment of four species cultured on the Mekong Delta, the countries farmed seafood ‘hub’, found a clear distinction between species cultured with a local domestic market orientation (Giant Freshwater Prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii; and Tilapia Oreochromis niloticus) and the two key export commodities - Striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) and Penaeid shrimp (Penaeus monodon & Litopenaeus vannamei). These orientations were based on a range of factors including the development of effective seed supplies and the cultural value of marketing in the live format. This study, conducted in ten provinces in the Mekong Delta from 2009 to 2013 had a focus on understanding the export-orientated commodities, <b>striped</b> catfish and <b>shrimp</b> through collection of baseline information on the value chain of farmed seafood, focusing on the farming sector, the actors and institutions involved and beneficiaries.

This industry includes the production of ornamental fish, {{fish for human consumption}} (food fish), and recreational fish that are used to stock private and public ponds and lakes. Fish are produced in both man-made ponds and indoor tank systems throughout the state. The different types of fish that are produced include, but are not limited to, yellow perch, tilapia, bait fish, hybrid <b>striped</b> bass, marine <b>shrimp,</b> freshwater fish, ornamentals, and trophy fish. ^ Economic data such as annual cost structures and sales was collected from a sample of fish farmers in Indiana and used to assess the overall economic impact of the industry using IMPLAN (IMpact Analysis for PLANning). The direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts of the aquaculture industry were estimated. The industry supports 280 jobs within the aquaculture industry and other supporting industries. Of those 280 jobs, 169 of them are employed directly by the producers in the aquaculture industry. The aquaculture industry generates 3, 731, 842 worth of labor income within the industry and a total of 7, 541, 867 worth of labor income in the aquaculture industry and other supporting industries.
