25|$|At {{approximately}} 7:00 p.m. McLoren and Farris {{were in the}} McLoren backyard in {{the immediate}} vicinity of the fort. Without permission or invitation, all appellants as a group entered the McLoren backyard by hopping over a fence. Micah Holland (Micah) and Miliotti entered first. Jason and Hein followed approximately ten to fifteen feet behind Micah and Miliotti. Micah immediately entered the fort and Miliotti <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> Appellants did not have permission or invitation to enter the fort. There had not been prior arrangement for the sale of marijuana between McLoren and appellants.|$|E
25|$|Charles Cortimiglia was an {{immigrant}} {{who lived with}} his wife and baby on the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Second Street in Gretna, Louisiana, a New Orleans suburb, across the Mississippi River. On the night of March 10, 1919, screams were heard coming from the Cortimiglia Residence. Grocer Iorlando Jordano rushed across the street to investigate. Upon his arrival, Jordano noticed that Charles Cortimiglia, his wife Rosie, and their infant daughter, Mary, had all been attacked by the unknown intruder. Rosie <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> with a serious head wound, clutching her deceased daughter. Charles laid on the floor, bleeding profusely. The couple was rushed to Charity Hospital, where it was discovered that both had suffered skull fractures. Nothing was stolen from the house, but a panel on the back door had been chiseled away. A bloody axe was found on the back porch of the home. Charles was released two days later, while his wife remained in the care of doctors. Upon gaining full consciousness, Rosie made claims that Iorlando Jordano and his 18-year-old son, Frank, were responsible for the attacks. Iorlando, a 69-year-old man, was in too poor of health to have committed the crimes. Frank Jordano, more than six feet tall and weighing over 200 pounds, would have been too large to have fit through the panel on the back door. Charles Cortimiglia vehemently denied his wife's claims, yet police nonetheless arrested the two, and charged them with the murder. The men would later be found guilty. Frank was sentenced to hang, and his father to life in prison. Charles Cortimiglia divorced his wife after the trial. Almost a year later, Rosie announced that she had falsely accused the two out of jealousy and spite. Her statement was the only evidence against the Jordanos, and they were released from jail shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Andy Koch and John Eide, {{who once}} shared {{a room with}} Cho at Cochrane Hall during 2005 and 2006, stated that Cho {{demonstrated}} other repetitive behaviors, such as listening repeatedly to [...] "Shine" [...] by the alternative rock band Collective Soul. He wrote the lines from the song's lyrics [...] "Teach me how to speak/Teach me how to share/Teach me where to go" [...] {{on the wall of}} his dormitory room. Koch described two further unusual incidents, one in which Cho <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of his room late at night taking photographs of him, and another in which Cho repeatedly placed harassing cell phone calls to Koch as [...] "Cho's brother, 'Question Mark'," [...] a name Cho also used when introducing himself to girls. Koch and Eide searched Cho's belongings and found a pocket knife, but they did not find any items that they deemed threatening.|$|E

500|$|As Greeneville {{ascended to}} periscope depth, Waddle checked the sonar {{displays}} {{and the fire}} control station monitors, but reported later that he heard and saw nothing {{to suggest that the}} previously detected vessels in the area were now any closer to the submarine's position than had been reported before the submarine began the high speed maneuvers. Because the AVSDU was not working, Greenevilles executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens. [...] Pfeifer then <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room. [...] At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14. [...] Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow [...] accurate determination on Ehime Marus range or course. [...] Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.|$|E

2500|$|Looking for {{marijuana}}, {{the five}} {{drove to the}} home of Michael McLoren, who was known to sell marijuana from a desk drawer in a ramshackle one-room [...] "fort" [...] in his backyard. [...] A key factor in the murder trial would be whether the five intended to buy marijuana or to steal it. [...] McLoren, 17, and his friend, Jimmy Farris, 16, were in the yard outside the fort when four of the five youths hopped the fence, with Micah Holland, 15, leading the way. [...] Micah entered the fort and Anthony Miliotti, 17, physically the largest of the group, <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> Their entry to the property would draw an additional charge of burglary.|$|E

[...] As he <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> a Portland Police officer ordered him {{to move on and}} threatened to arrest him if he refused to comply. [...] Believing he had done no wrong, Stewart objected and the policeman arrested him and made him walk a mile on his prosthetic leg to the police station where he was booked for drunkenness. [...] Authorities refused to charge Stewart, and the next day he filed a complaint of assault and battery with the district attorney, who issued an arrest warrant against the officer. At the hearing the officer maintained that Stewart was very inebriated while Stewart produced numerous witnesses from the banquet arguing the opposite. [...] The complaint was dismissed and Stewart appealed to the Mayor of Portland and publicized the incident in The Oregon Journal. [...] Whether there was any further action is unknown.|$|E
