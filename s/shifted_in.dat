40|$|Between 1950 and 2012, boreal summer (rainy season) {{rainfall}} in the Sahel {{changed from}} a multi-decadal decreasing trend to an increasing trend (positive trend <b>shift)</b> <b>in</b> the mid- 1980 s. We found that this trend shift was synchronous with similar trend <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> global oceanic evaporation and in land precipitation on all continents except the Americas. The trend <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> oceanic evaporation occurred mainly in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and the subtropical oceans of the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Because increased oceanic evaporation strengthens the atmospheric moisture transport toward land areas, the synchrony of oceanic evaporation and land precipitation is reasonable. Surface scalar winds over the SH oceans also displayed a positive trend shift. Sea surface temperature (SST) displayed a trend <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> the mid- 1980 s that was negative (increasing, then decreasing) in the SH and positive in the NH. Although SST had opposite trend <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> both hemispheres, the trend <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> evaporation was positive in both hemispheres. We infer that because strong winds promote evaporative cooling, the trend <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> SH winds strengthened the trend <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> both SST and evaporation in the SH. Because high SST promotes evaporation, the trend <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> NH SST strengthened the NH trend <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> evaporation. Thus differing oceanic roles in the SH and NH generated the positive trend <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> evaporation; however, the details of moisture transport toward the Sahel are still unclear, or perhaps {{there is no single}} determining influence...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to help {{supply chain}} {{managers}} {{to determine the}} value of retailer-supplier partnership initiatives beyond information sharing (IS) according to their specific business environment under time-varying demand conditions. For this purpose, we use integer linear programming models to quantify the benefits that can be accrued by a retailer, a supplier and {{system as a whole}} from <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> inventory ownership and <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> decision-making power with that of IS. The results of a detailed numerical study pertaining to static time horizon reveal that the <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> inventory ownership provides system-wide cost benefits in specific settings. Particularly, when it induces the retailer to order larger quantities and the supplier also prefers such orders due to significantly high setup and shipment costs. We observe that the relative benefits of <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> decision-making power are always higher than the <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> inventory ownership under all the conditions. The value of the <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> decision-making power is greater than IS particularly when the variability of underlying demand is low and time-dependent variation in production cost is high. However, when the shipment cost is negligible and order issuing efficiency of the supplier is low, the cost benefits of <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> decision-making power beyond IS are not significant...|$|R

40|$|According to Paul Krugman, "the European {{unemployment}} {{problem and}} the US inequality problem are {{two sides of the}} same coin". In other words, both continents have had the same <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> demand towards skill; in the US relative wages have adjusted and in Europe not. The implication of this hypothesis is that in Europe the unemployment rate for the unskilled will have risen but the unemployment rate for the skilled will have fallen. In fact it has risen. To investigate the hypothesis more systematically we develop an internally consistent model which allocates the change in a country's unemployment between that resulting from (a) <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> relative demand for skill minus <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> relative supply, (b) <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> the relative intercepts of skilled and unskilled wage functions, (c) <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> aggregate wage pressure. We show that the rise in British unemployment relative to the US since the 1970 s is almost certainly due to <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> aggregate wage pressure. Similarly for 5 other European countries the combination of (a) and (b) accounts for none of the increase in unemployment since the 1970 s. ...|$|R

5|$|Subdivision {{surfaces}} in computer graphics use subdivision rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision. These subdivision surfaces (such as the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface) take a polygon mesh (the kind used in 3D animated movies) and refines it to a mesh with more polygons by adding and shifting points according to different recursive formulas. Although many points get <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> this process, each new mesh is combinatorially a subdivision {{of the old}} mesh (meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh, you can identify a corresponding edge and vertex in the new one, plus several more edges and vertices).|$|E

5|$|In {{another study}} that {{appeared}} in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were <b>shifted</b> <b>in</b> traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.|$|E
