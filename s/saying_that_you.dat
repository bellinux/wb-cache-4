5|$|Several nuns {{were given}} a {{platform}} to air their views including activist nuns such as Marjorie Tuite, Margaret Traxler, and six nuns of the order Sisters of Loretto, an order known for its work on pacifism and social justice. In some cases, signers of the statement grew more radical in their beliefs after being reprimanded by church authority. In the publicity surrounding the dispute with the nuns and the theologians, the statistics showing that most American Catholics disagreed with church teachings about abortion were repeated many times. Traxler appeared in a television spot with a tube of toothpaste, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> cannot put the toothpaste back in the tube. The various responses to the 1984 advertisement and its aftermath remained in the news through 1986.|$|E

2500|$|Jessie J {{has been}} criticized by people who find the lyrics of the song hypocritical: a [...] "rich rock star" [...] telling {{the rest of us}} that money doesn't matter, or {{questioning}} why she then charges for her music. She has repeatedly explained in interviews that this is a misreading of her meaning, which skewers the superficiality of conspicuous consumption -- or more simply, that [...] "show-offs suck." [...] "For me, so much I hear about how much money people have and how people just take stuff too seriously. It’s not me <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can live for free, because obviously that isn’t the case; but I’m <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don’t always have to let it be about that.

2500|$|Ayatollah Rafsanjani is a {{supporter}} of Iran's nuclear program. In 2007 Rafsanjani reiterated {{that the use of}} weapons of mass destruction was not part of the Islamic Republic culture. Rafsanjani said: [...] "You [...] are <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> cannot trust Iran would not use its nuclear achievements in the military industries, but we are ready to give you full assurances in this respect."

I won't get into any trouble by the NFL by <b>saying</b> <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> know. I have had fun throughout my years and, you know, predominantly in the offseason." [...] The interview drew criticism from the league office, and his agent tried to spin it that his words were taken out of context.

2500|$|Within the story, after {{spending}} time with Luke, Noah is seen struggling {{to come to terms}} with his sexuality, and is often angry and confused. Luke and Noah's portrayers, Hansis and Silbermann, spoke with magazine The Advocate about the attention the storyline has generated. [...] "The fan response has been really great to both the individual characters and where we're taking the relationship," [...] Silbermann stated. [...] "Noah and Luke were voted top couple in a Soap Opera Digest poll. The funny thing is, a lot of people want them to be happy, but a lot want them to suffer heartache and tragedy [...] because that's what couples on daytime TV do. It's a good sign, actually." [...] Hansis said that [...] "it does throw you a bit, especially since this was [...] first big role on television" [...] and [...] "You go from waiting tables to doing interviews with national magazines and people <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> changed their lives. It's definitely tricky".|$|E
2500|$|... "Young, Wild & Free" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by most music critics. Kyle Anderson writing for Entertainment Weekly praised the song {{by saying that}} evokes nostalgic sentiments due to the [...] "sweet" [...] Bruno Mars' hook. Anderson continued, his compliments, saying that it has [...] "song of summer written all over it" [...] and that [...] "could have been a graduation anthem for stoners everywhere", if it was released in May. MTV's Jenna Rubenstein gave a generally positive review as she strongly believes {{that is more than}} a [...] "reckless party jam". The three singers don't care who judges them and Rubenstein thinks [...] "that's the positive, family-friendly, family-friendly message we're taking". Billboard magazine rated the song three and half out of five stars, calling it [...] "a haze of nostalgia". The review acclaimed Snoop Dogg's effortless flow, although it criticized the flow by Whiz Khalifa labeled its delivery as [...] "forceful" [...] and [...] "punchy" [...] since it [...] "gets on top of the beat and harshes the mellow laid-back production." [...] In a similar review, Lewis Corner from Digital Spy had a positive opinion towards Dogg's verses, while finding the single [...] "cool and addictive". However, he felt that the flavor of the recording didn't last long. In negative perspective, Shea Serrano from LA Weekly compared the track's atmospheric to the [...] "inside of a cloud (smoke), a celebration or idea of what some teenagers who smoke pot would like". The reviewer continued by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't have a song where the protagonists are not young, wild & free, addressing such critics to Snoop Dogg.|$|E

2500|$|This {{prohibition}} {{also was}} (and in many circles, still is) commonly understood to disallow operating electrical switches. One reason is that, when actuating electromechanical switches that carry a live current, {{there is always}} the possibility that a small electric spark will be generated. [...] This spark may {{be thought of as a}} kind of fire, although since it is incidental and one does not benefit from it, it may not be a Sabbath violation at all. In any case, as science became more advanced, and the properties of fire and electricity became better understood, the former reasoning broke down: fire is a chemical reaction involving the release of energy; the flow of an electric current is a physical reaction. Therefore, some hold that the proper reason it is forbidden to complete electric circuits is because it involves construction or building (i.e., the building and completion of an electric circuit—see above). Rav Aurbach, a leading and widely accepted ultra-orthodox posek declined this argument comparing it to <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> cannot shut a door, as it will effectively be completing a wall. He wrote, [...] "In my opinion there is no prohibition [...] on Shabbat or Yom Tov... There is no prohibition of ma'keh bepatish or molid... (However, I [...] am afraid that the masses will err and turn on incandescent lights on Shabbat, and thus I do not permit electricity absent great need...) ... This matter requires further analysis. ... However, the key point in my opinion is that there is no prohibition to use electricity on Shabbat unless the electricity causes a prohibited act like cooking or starting a flame." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} film with three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying; [...] "It involved actual questions of morality, just as The Dark Knight does. It's not simply about good and evil but about choices". He also felt [...] "the movie works like thrillers used to work, before {{they were required to}} contain villains the size of buildings", also calling the film [...] "a skillful thriller". Sandra Hall of the Sydney Morning Herald was more equivocal, saying, [...] "... it just about works, thanks to Carter's sense of timing and the script's allegorical enhancements." [...] Empire gave the film three stars ("good"), but expressed a desire for Chris Carter to return to the more comedic and [...] "post-modern" [...] elements of the series upon the next revisit. Stephanie Zackarek was mostly positive towards the film, saying; [...] "I Want to Believe comes off like a solid if not great episode from one of the show's early seasons, a reasonably suspenseful story made by a director with a sturdy sense of how to tell a story." [...] Mick LaSalle was also positive towards the film, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> didn't need to know anything about the previous settings and calling it a [...] "compelling suspense thriller with some tense moments." [...] TV Guide reviewer Maitland McDonagh gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four saying that the film was not [...] "sufficiently gripping to transform a middling thriller into something truly provocative or haunting." [...] About the theme and story she said, [...] "such weighty concerns aren't the stuff of most mainstream genre movies." ...|$|E
