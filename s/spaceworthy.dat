50|$|When Shockwave {{arranged}} for the capture and extradition of Prime and Megatrons forces as war criminals, Soundwave was among the captives, but when Starscream jettisoned Megatron into space on the return trip to Cybertron, Soundwave made {{the best of a}} bad lot and teamed with Starscream to return to Earth and conquer it, being reunited with Ratbat in the process. Heading back to Earth in a kidnapped Sky Lynx and with the Combaticons now added to their ranks, the Decepticons attacked the Ark in hopes of acquiring parts to make the Nemesis <b>spaceworthy</b> again, however Soundwave, Skywarp and Thundercracker were defeated and thrown in the Arks brig. When the Combaticons, combined as Bruticus, laid into the vessel, they were freed.|$|E
50|$|With {{the stolen}} ship emptied of its cargo of weapons, the Mechs {{lay out the}} bodies {{of half a dozen}} Patrolmen who had been shot with Arch rifles. An alien among them takes pictures, clearly {{intending}} to blame Yorke's Horde for an atrocity against the most respected institution in the galaxy. Once the Mechs and their Llor helpers leave, Hansu takes his men down into the scene and they give the Patrolmen a proper burial. They find that the ship, appearing to have been looted, is still <b>spaceworthy,</b> so the four men strap themselves into the acceleration seats and the Horde's engineer lifts them into space, setting course for Terra. The men need to get their message of betrayal to Deputy-Commander Matthias.|$|E
50|$|Earth's {{efforts to}} {{construct}} starships {{of its own}} using reverse-engineered alien technology begin in the season 4 episode , with the less-than-successful X-301. In season 6, the X-302 (later F-302), the first <b>spaceworthy</b> Earth fighter, is introduced, along with Earth's first space battlecruiser, the Prometheus. Squadrons of F-302s are eventually stationed on Earth, Atlantis, the SGC's alternative sites, and its battlecruisers. In season 2 of Stargate Atlantis, the Daedalus-class battlecruiser is introduced, incorporating advancements that were tested on the Prometheus. Thus far, six Daedalus-class battlecruisers {{have appeared in the}} series: the Daedalus, the Odyssey, the Korolev (destroyed in season 9), the Apollo, the Sun Tzu, and the George Hammond (named the Phoenix in an alternate timeline). Except for the Korolev and the Sun Tzu, which are operated by the Russians and Chinese respectively, all Earth combat spacecraft are operated by the United States Air Force. The United States Senate Appropriations Committee considers the construction of Daedalus-class ships to be its top priority in terms of planetary defense.|$|E
50|$|Later, when Optimus Prime led a {{rebellion}} against Shockwave's domination of Cybertron in 2003, Starscream {{took the opportunity}} to form a power base, taking the protoform Combaticons to Earth and outfitting them with new alternate modes taken from an abandoned military base, then leading them in an attack on the Ark in order to acquire parts to make the Decepticon space cruiser, the Nemesis, <b>spaceworthy.</b> Confronted in battle by Brawn, Bruticus was caught in an explosion as Ratchet self-destructed the Ark, but he survived the conflagration, only to be knocked out by artillery fire from an incoming Autobot shuttle. After a battle with the evil clone, Sunstorm, Brawn opted to work out some of his stress on Bruticus's unconscious body, punching the gestalt about the head until his comrades yelled at him to stop. Bruticus would return, battling Sky Lynx for Starscream's amusement - until the Predacons appeared in their combined form of Predaking. The two gestalts battled as Starscream fled and Bruticus lost. The ultimate fate of the Combaticons in the Dreamwave universe was not revealed, due to the company's closure.|$|E

Ships are mysteriously disappearing on the direct [...] "Alderson" [...] (hyperspace) path from the planet Meiji in the 82 Eridani system to the Earth. In Pournelle's future history, the CoDominium authority discourages scientific research; only renegade physicist Marie Ward remembers the old idea of black holes, and she theorizes that a stellar black hole is causing passing vessels {{to drop out of}} hyperspace and trapping them in its gravity well. Captain Bartholomew Ramsey commands a likely to be suicidal mission along the fateful trajectory to test the theory, and finds it all too true and himself with his own craft trapped right alongside the missing—and grotesquely damaged—ships. Following a hunch of Ward, a heroic officer (and Ramsey's romantic rival) volunteers to pilot the most <b>spaceworthy</b> of the hulks straight into the hole, to unleash a torrent of powerful gravity waves. By turning on its short-lived Alderson drive at the precisely calculated moment of impact, Ramsey's ship is able to surf out of the well and return to 82 Eridani with all the black hole's previous survivors on board.|$|E

5000|$|In the Homeworld series, the ion cannon is a {{powerful}} space-borne artillery weapon primarily used against large capital ships. When fired, it produces a glowing particle beam (in one of three colours, depending on which faction the weapon belongs to) that makes contact with the target instantaneously, but the beam can only be maintained {{for a few seconds}} before it must shut down for several seconds, presumably to prevent overheating. The weapon itself is so large and power-hungry that {{in order to make it}} <b>spaceworthy</b> an entire frigate chassis is required to carry it, and such a craft can only carry one standard cannon. Larger ships can carry multiple cannons, with the Heavy Cruiser packing four in dual turret mounts, and the Hiigaran Battlecruiser and Somtaaw Dreadnaught carrying one on the top and one on the bottom for maximum coverage. Again though, the usual fire-time limits apply. Both the Bentusi and the Kadeshi have managed to improve the original design: the Kadeshi version has much smaller size and power requirements, hence a single frigate can carry four ion cannons and still retain remarkable maneuvering capabilities. The Bentusi version, on the other hand, can fire indefinitely and can switch between and track targets so quickly that even nimble fighters are viable targets. The Bentusi also miniaturized their weapon to an even larger extent than the Kadeshi, to the point that their [...] "Super Acolyte" [...] fighter carries a pair of them, an engineering feat that less advanced species' navies require at least a destroyer-class starship to manage. It is implied in Homeworld 2 that the technological basis of these weapons are the ancient Phase Cannon Arrays carried by larger Progenitor warships.|$|E
40|$|A {{segmented}} {{linear approximation}} of the quadratic phase function {{that is used}} to focus the synthetic antenna of a SAR was studied. Ideal focusing, using a quadratic varying phase focusing function during the time radar target histories are gathered, requires a large number of complex multiplications. These can be largely eliminated by using linear approximation techniques. The result is a reduced processor size and chip count relative to ideally focussed processing and a correspondingly increased feasibility for <b>spaceworthy</b> implementation. A preliminary design and sizing for a <b>spaceworthy</b> linear approximation SAR azimuth processor meeting requirements {{similar to those of the}} SEASAT-A SAR was developed. The study resulted in a design with approximately 1500 IC's, 1. 2 cubic feet of volume, and 350 watts of power for a single look, 4000 range cell azimuth processor with 25 meters resolution...|$|E

In order to develop an improved system level mission design, an integration of evolutionary robotics and `traditional' space mission design methodologies is proposed. 1. OVERALL CONCEPT The success of currently planned near/medium term planetary exploration missions is almost invariably based on unmanned autonomous or semi-autonomous activities requiring high levels of reliability and mission robustness. Studies into such mission scenarios show that conventional European space technology, even with optimistic predictions of near-term development, is unlikely to achieve the necessary system performance. Using traditional design techniques, current robotic vehicles need to exhibit virtually fault-free [...] ...|$|E

40|$|A <b>spaceworthy</b> {{adiabatic}} demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) under development at NASA-Goddard is presented. A baseline model heat switch was tested extensively with an on/off ratio of about 10, 000 and a parasitic heat leak of 10 micro-W. Data {{obtained from the}} breadboard models were used to design an ADR with improved structural integrity. The core of the ADR is the salt pill which consists of the paramagnetic salt crystal and the thermal bus. When a magnetic field {{is applied to the}} salt it forces the alignment of the magnetic moments, thereby decreasing the entropy of the salt. Preliminary tests results showed a net crystal mass of 680 g instead of the expected 740 g, which indicate that there are gaps in the salt pill. A partial fix was accomplished by sealing helium gas in the salt pill at a pressure of 2 bar, which improved the thermal contact during salt magnetization, at about 2 K...|$|E
40|$|A <b>spaceworthy</b> Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator {{is under}} {{development}} at Goddard Space Flight Center {{as part of}} the X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS), an instrument on the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF). XRS will employ an array of 32 microcalorimeters capable of detecting X-rays in the energy range of 0. 3 - 10 keV. In order to achieve a desired resolution of 12 eV, these detectors must be operated at a temperature of 0. 065 - 0. 100 K. An ADR must be used to cool these detectors in space. A breadboard model was designed and built less than two years ago, and provided excellent results. We are presently at the development stage of the engineering model. Several changes have been made to the original design in order to improve the efficiency of the ADR, to reduce its weight, and to strengthen the salt pill suspension system so that the ADR can survive launch loads and have low sensitivity to microphonic inputs. We shall report on the results of these changes; what worked and what did not...|$|E

The coating is composed primarily of carbon-carbon, a carbon-fiber and carbon-matrix composite material that has gained a <b>spaceworthy</b> reputation due to its ability to withstand ultrahigh temperatures. C-CAT's high-melt coating embeds hafnium carbide (HfC) and zirconium diboride (ZrB 2) within the outer layers of a carbon-carbon structure. The coating demonstrated enhanced high-temperature durability and suffered no erosion during a test in NASA's Arc Jet Complex. (Test parameters: stagnation heat flux= 198 BTD/sq ft-sec; pressure=. 265 atm; temperature= 3, 100 F; four cycles totaling 28 minutes) In Phase I of the project, C-CAT successfully demonstrated large-scale manufacturability with a 40 -inch cylinder representing {{the end of a}} nozzle extension and a 16 -inch flanged cylinder representing the attach flange of a nozzle extension. These demonstrators were manufactured without spalling or delaminations. In Phase II, C-CAT worked with engine designers to develop a nozzle extension stub skirt interfaced with an Aerojet Rocketdyne RL 10 engine. All objectives for Phase II were successfully met. Additional nonengine applications for the coating include thermal protection systems (TPS) for next-generation spacecraft and hypersonic aircraft...|$|E
