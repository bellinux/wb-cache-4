5|$|The German women's {{national}} football team wears white shirts with black <b>shorts</b> and white socks, following {{the tradition of}} the German men's team– black and white are the colours of Prussia. The current change kit is red and black, with black <b>shorts</b> and red socks. In the past, Germany also used green shirts with white <b>shorts</b> and green socks as the away kit.|$|E
5|$|The club is {{associated}} with two very different colour schemes—white and black (first permanently adopted in 1920), and orange, navy and white (first used in 1973, and worn by the team as of the 2015–16 season). Luton mainly wore a combination of light blue and white before 1920, when white shirts and black <b>shorts</b> were first adopted. These colours were retained for over half a century, with the colour of the socks varying between white and black, until Luton changed to orange, navy and white {{at the start of}} the 1973–74 season. Luton began playing in white shirts, <b>shorts</b> and socks in 1979, with the orange and navy motif reduced to trim; navy <b>shorts</b> were adopted in 1984. This palette was retained until the 1999–2000 season, when the team played in orange shirts and blue <b>shorts.</b> From 2000 to 2008, Luton returned to white shirts and black shorts; orange was included as trim until 2007. The white, navy and orange palette favoured in the 1980s was brought back in 2008, following the results of a club poll, but a year later the colours were changed yet again, this time to a predominantly orange strip with white <b>shorts.</b> Navy <b>shorts</b> were readopted in 2011. Luton are wearing orange shirts, navy <b>shorts</b> and white socks during the 2015–16 season.|$|E
5|$|The team {{adopted a}} new home kit, which {{featured}} red shirts with white collars, white trims on the shoulders and white sleeves that included red trims. York started the season wearing red <b>shorts</b> with white trims, but these were replaced {{later in the season}} with navy blue <b>shorts</b> with white trims. The home kit also included red <b>shorts</b> with white trims. The away kit, retained from the previous season, comprised light blue shirts with white horizontal stripes, light blue <b>shorts</b> and light blue socks. Pryers Solicitors continued as shirt sponsors for the second successive season.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of the}} club's history, Hull {{have worn}} black and amber shirts with black <b>shorts.</b> These black and amber colours are where Hull's nickname, The Tigers, {{originated}} from. However, in the club's first match against Notts County in 1904, white shirts were worn, with black <b>shorts</b> and black socks. During their first season in the League, Hull wore black and amber striped shirts and black <b>shorts,</b> which they continued to wear until the Second World War {{with the exception of}} the 1935–36 season, in which they wore sky blue shirts. Following the end of the Second World War, Hull spent another season wearing sky blue, but changed to plain amber shirts, which they wore until the early 1960s, when they swapped back to stripes.|$|E

5|$|In March 1939, Aberdeen {{changed the}} black and gold colours to red and white, {{reflecting}} the silver and red colours of the official City of Aberdeen arms. The first red strips were worn with white <b>shorts,</b> with either red or white socks from 1939 until the 1965–66 season. In 1966, Aberdeen adopted red <b>shorts,</b> making the official kit all-red, {{similar to that of}} Liverpool, who made a similar change at around the same time. This arrangement has continued to the present day, with several variations in design, in common with most senior clubs as the replica shirt market has expanded. In the late 1970s an Admiral strip featured five vertical white stripes {{on the left side of}} the shirt and <b>shorts,</b> and the early 1980s shirts—as worn at the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup final—featured white vertical pinstripes. Later design changes included significant amounts of blue, and a one-season reversion to white <b>shorts,</b> although the all-red scheme returned in 1997.|$|E

5|$|Stockport County's {{traditional}} kit colours {{are blue}} and white, {{although they have}} played in other colours throughout their history. Originally competing in blue and white striped jerseys and white <b>shorts,</b> they experimented with red and white stripes in the early 1900s, and from the mid-1930s to mid-1960s played in white jerseys and black <b>shorts.</b> No set pattern has been established for the club's use of blue and white as main colours, as they have played at various times in a white jersey with a blue band and blue <b>shorts</b> and a blue jersey with white pin stripes and white <b>shorts.</b> They made a short experiment with an Argentina-style kit, light blue and white stripes with black <b>shorts,</b> after the 1978 World Cup. This was abandoned after {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War, and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue <b>shorts</b> in the 1980s. County marked their 125th anniversary during 2008 by bringing in a third kit – a gold colour with black trim. The kit was worn on 17 occasions, all away trips. The strip was retired 'undefeated' {{at the end of the}} year, having been worn for 13 victories and 4 draws. The kit was also worn during a match against Chester City which was abandoned after 59 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The French team {{traditionally}} {{played in}} blue shirts, white <b>shorts,</b> and red socks, {{the colors of}} the national flag, and as such were nicknamed les tricolores. Due to the mostly blue strip the French team currently wears, the team is now often referred to as les Bleus (the Blues), like many other French sporting teams. When this strip clashes with that of their opponents, such as in games against Scotland and Italy, French players wear white. New strips were developed for the 2007 World Cup, one of which is a darker blue. In June 2011 they relaunched another kit which they wear blue shirt, blue <b>shorts</b> and blue socks for their home kit and they wear white shirt, white <b>shorts</b> and white socks for their away kit.|$|E
