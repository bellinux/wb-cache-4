5|$|At 22:30 the fog {{lifted and}} Kouma <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid {{across the river}} {{directly}} in front of his position. Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5|$|In June 1943, Mayer {{encountered}} Robert S. Johnson, {{a future}} ace from the 56th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force. Johnson's P-47 Thunderbolt had been badly shot-up by some Focke Wulf Fw 190s during a routine mission. As Johnson limped home, with a canopy {{that would not}} open and hydraulic fluid and oil covering his windscreen, Mayer pulled alongside him in his Fw 190. Mayer looked the wounded P-47 over, and then circled to come in from Johnson's six-o'clock {{to give it the}} coup de grâce. The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter out of the sky. Mayer made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, Mayer pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even moving around the airplane. He also <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> 20mm cannon shell had exploded just behind his headrest, which had made it impossible to open his canopy.|$|E
5|$|Later in {{the morning}} North Korean barges crossed the Naktong below A Company. The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the {{southern}} tip of the ridge overlooking Agok to take these troops under fire. When the squad reached the tip of the ridge they <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> North Korean force occupied houses at its base. The company hit these houses with artillery. The North Koreans broke from the houses, running for the river. At this the light machine gun {{at the tip of the}} ridge took them under fire, as did another across the Naktong to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector. Proximity fuze artillery fire decimated this group. Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force. In the afternoon, US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company; only part of it was recovered. The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night.|$|E

25|$|Although a socialist, Attlee still {{believed}} in the British Empire of his youth. He {{thought of it as}} an institution that was a power for good in the world.

25|$|According to Eleanor Womer, Dugal Campbell (Mary's brother) {{accompanied}} Colonel Bouquet to the Muskingum.

25|$|Britain {{found itself}} {{bound by the}} Westminster Convention and entered the war on the Prussian side. Newcastle was deeply {{reluctant}} to do this, but he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Prussian collapse would be disastrous to British and Hanoverian interests. The Anglo-Prussian Alliance was established, which saw large amounts of subsidy given to Prussia. Some supporters of George II were strong advocates of support for Prussia, as they saw {{it would be impossible}} to defend his realm of Hanover if they were to be defeated. Despite his initial dislike of Frederick, the King later moved towards this viewpoint.|$|E
25|$|Thielmann, {{judging by}} the want of vigour {{displayed}} in the French pursuit and by the French not having attempted to secure {{the passage of the}} Dyle at Mousty, , and Limale, considered that it was only a weak detachment that was advancing upon Wavre, confining itself to the design of creating some little uneasiness by its movement along this road to Brussels. He had hitherto been of the opinion that the occupation of Wavre by a few battalions, as directed by Blücher, would be quite sufficient, but he now plainly <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> moment had arrived which required him, in pursuance of his instructions, to maintain the position at Wavre. Accordingly, he ordered the halt of his whole corps for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|After further delays, Revolution {{announced}} on 5 November {{that the game}} will be released as a two-part episodic title, with the first episode coming on 4 December 2013, and the second one in Q1 2014. Initial releases would be for desktop platforms, and other releases would follow shortly after. Cecil explained that the game became much larger than they had anticipated, with enough content for two full-fledged games. This meant that the title would not be fully completed {{by the end of}} 2013, but Revolution had promised a 2013 release, and so came the decision to split the game in two. Cecil also added that sometimes games are too long, and players don't find time to finish it, and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> split would also benefit in this field. He compared the length of a single episode to that of The Smoking Mirror.|$|E

500|$|As the {{railroad}} age evolved, business-oriented Southerners <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> railroad linking the South with the Pacific Coast would expand trade opportunities. [...] They thought the topography {{of the southern}} portion of the original boundary line to the Mexican Cession (future states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, western Colorado) of 1848 was too mountainous to allow a direct route. Projected southern railroad routes tended to veer to the north as they proceeded eastward, which would favor connections with northern railroads and ultimately favor northern seaports. Southerners saw that to avoid the mountains, a route with a southeastern terminus might need to swing south into what was still Mexican territory.|$|E
500|$|Most of the cytosol is [...] water, {{which makes}} up about 70% {{of the total}} volume of a typical cell. The pH of the {{intracellular}} fluid is 7.4. while human cytosolic pH ranges between 7.0 - 7.4, and is usually higher if a cell is growing. The viscosity of cytoplasm is roughly the same as pure water, although diffusion of small molecules through this liquid is about fourfold slower than in pure water, due mostly to collisions with {{the large numbers of}} macromolecules in the cytosol. Studies in the brine shrimp have examined how water affects cell functions; these <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> 20% reduction in the amount of water in a cell inhibits metabolism, with metabolism decreasing progressively as the cell dries out and all metabolic activity halting when the water level reaches 70% below normal.|$|E
500|$|The legend narrates {{the tale}} behind the {{tradition}} of offering the Ucchishta, which otherwise is a taboo in Hinduism. Once, Shiva {{on a visit to}} Vishnu's abode Vaikuntha, <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> few food grains (Ucchishta) had fallen on the ground after Vishnu finished his meal. [...] Shiva quickly picked up a grain and swallowed it. Unbeknownst to him, half of it stuck to his beard. [...] When he returned to his abode, the sage Narada saw the half grain on Shiva's beard, and ate it. [...] Parvati, Shiva's consort, was upset that her rightful share of Vishnu's prasad had been eaten by Narada. In a peeved mood, she went to Vishnu and complained. Vishnu pacified her saying that in the Kali Yuga (the present era as per Hindu beliefs), she would live at Puri as Vimala, and would daily eat the remnants of his food.|$|E

500|$|On 20 March 1917, McNamara, {{flying a}} Martinsyde, {{was one of}} four No.1 Squadron pilots taking part in a raid against a Turkish railway {{junction}} near Gaza. Owing to a shortage of bombs, the aircraft were each armed with six specially modified 4.5-inch howitzer shells. McNamara had successfully dropped three of his shells when the fourth exploded prematurely, badly wounded him in the leg with shrapnel, an effect he likened to being [...] "hit with a sledgehammer". Having turned to head back to base, he spotted a fellow squadron member from the same mission, Captain David Rutherford, on the ground beside his crashlanded B.E.2. Allied airmen had been hacked to death by enemy troops in similar situations, and McNamara <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> company of Turkish cavalry was fast approaching Rutherford's position. Despite the rough terrain and the gash in his leg, McNamara landed near Rutherford in an attempt to rescue him.|$|E
500|$|After {{a day or}} so, Adams' family {{began searching}} the city for him, placing notices in several {{newspapers}} such as the New York Courier and Enquirer and the New York Weekly Tribune notifying people he was missing. A neighbor of Colt's, Asa H. Wheeler, told Adams' father-in-law, Joseph Lane, {{that he had heard}} noises in Colt's office that sounded like a fight followed by a crash to the floor. Peering in the keyhole, he saw someone [...] "bending over something on the floor". [...] Wheeler later secured a key from the landlord and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> large packing crate was missing and that the floor had been scrubbed. On September 22, 1841, Colt visited Adams' print shop inquiring about the status of his books and the whereabouts of Adams. Adams' bookbinder, Charles Wells, told Colt that the last time Adams had been seen was on the way to visit Colt himself. Colt made no reply to the implied allegation, and excused himself.|$|E

Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, with Kouma manning the M2 Browning [...]50-caliber machine gun atop the tank. As the gunner fired the tank's main cannon, Kouma sank many of the boats attempting to cross the river with his machine gun. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks heard over the field telephone that the company was withdrawing and that they should do likewise. Kouma instead opted to act as a rearguard to cover the infantry. He was wounded shortly thereafter in the foot reloading the tank's ammunition. He quickly fought off another North Korean attack across the river with his machine gun.|$|E

500|$|After the duel {{between the}} two ironclads at Hampton Roads there was concern by some Navy {{officials}} who witnessed the battle that Monitors design might allow for easy boarding by the Confederates. In a letter dated 27 April 1862 Lieutenant Commander O.C. Badger wrote to Lieutenant H. A. Wise, Assistant Inspector of Ordnance, advising the use of [...] "liquid fire", scalding water from the boiler through hoses and pipes, sprayed out via the vents and pilothouse window, to repel enemy boarders. Wise who was aboard and inspected Monitor after the battle responded in a letter of 30 April 1862: [...] "With reference to the Monitor, the moment I jumped on board of her after the fight I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> steam tug with twenty men could have taken {{the upper part of}} her in as many seconds... I hear that hot water pipes are arranged so as to scald the assailants when they may dare to set foot on her." [...] The chance to employ such a tactic never arose. There are conflicting accounts as to whether such an anti-personnel provision was installed.|$|E
500|$|The plot of {{the episode}} has origins in the 1970s. Marc Scott Zicree was {{attending}} a Clarion Science Fiction Writer's Workshop, and afterwards completed his undergraduate degree at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). While there, he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> class was being conducted by Theodore Sturgeon; Zicree snuck in since undergraduates {{were not allowed to}} attend. This resulted in Zicree meeting Michael Reaves, who was acting as the teacher's assistant for the lecture; the two became close friends. Around the same time, Reaves pitched a Sulu-based story for , but after the series went unproduced, the plot was never completed. The two began working as a writing duo over the following decades, but not exclusively, with Reaves writing the [...] episode [...] "Where No One Has Gone Before" [...] with Diane Duane. In 2005, Zicree was introduced to [...] by Walter Koenig when they were both on a Star Trek panel at a science fiction convention held at UCLA. Koenig was about to travel to film the episode [...] "To Serve All My Days".|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} a new [...] {{motorcycle}} was conceived in 1956, when Honda Motor's Soichiro Honda and Takeo Fujisawa toured Germany and witnessed the popularity of mopeds and lightweight motorcycles. Soichiro Honda was primarily the engineering and production leader of the company, always with an eye towards winning on the racetrack, while his close partner Fujisawa was the man of finance and business, heading up sales and formulating strategies intended to dominate markets and utterly destroy Honda Motor's competitors. Fujisawa {{had been thinking about}} a long term expansion strategy, and unlike other Japanese companies, {{they did not want to}} simply boost production to cash in on the recent economic boom in Japan. A small, high-performance motorcycle was central to his plans. Upwardly mobile consumers in postwar Europe typically went from a bicycle to a clip-on engine, then bought a scooter, then a bubble car, and then a small car and onwards. Fujisawa <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> motorcycle did not fit in this pattern for the average person, and he saw an opportunity to change that. Soichiro Honda was at the time tired of listening to Fujisawa talk about his new motorcycle idea; Honda came to Europe to win the Isle of Man TT race and wanted to think about little else.|$|E
