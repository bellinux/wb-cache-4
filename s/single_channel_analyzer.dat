The sodium iodide (NaI) scintillator {{has a high}} attenuation coefficient for the interaction of gamma rays and gives high efficiency and good resolution of gamma rays. When the analyzer of the counting system is in the differential mode, both lower and upper discriminators are used and the scintillation counting system is called a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> <b>analyzer</b> (SCA).

The principal idea is to output an analog signal that corresponds to the event counts during exposure time.

A very low noise performance is expected since no digital noise is involved. In addition, since no digital counter {{is included in the}} pixel a significant reduction in area and power concumption is obtained. The window discriminator is insensitive to the rise time of the input pulse. Circuit constrains are discussed, and a performance simulation is presented for a design example.

In the present work, seme coincidence studies were made {{on one of the}} beta groups appearing in the cerium- 144 decay and on the gamma rays appearing in the deexcitations from the energy levels of praseodymium- 144. Sources of cerium- 144 were prepared frcm carrier free radioactive cerium- 144 as supplied by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The sample material was more than two {{years old at the time}} of preparation of sources. No additional chemical purification was attempted. Sources for use in the beta crystal spectrometer were mounted on thin Formvar film on spectrometer ring mounts. The gamma ray spectrum of cerium- 144 in the energy range 20 kev to 180 kev is shown in Figure 1. This spectrum was determined using a 2 -inch by 2 -inch NaI(Tl) crystal. The pulse spectrum was analyzed by a Radiation Instrument Development Laboratory (RIDL) 200 channel analyzer. The spectrum gives clear evidence of gamma ray peaks at 34 {+-} 3 kev and 134 {+-} 2 kev. A rather broad peak at 80 kev is observed. An indication of a gamma ray group of energy near 100 kev is also shown. The resolution of the detecting assembly was 9. 8 percent at 662 kev. The uncorrected relative intensities of the three groups of 34, 80 and 134 kev are 95, 35, and 100, respectively. These intensities are for the gamma radiation exclusive of internal conversion. Gamma-gamma coincidence measurements were made using two of the 2 -inch by 2 -inch sodium iodide crystals placed at 90 degrees to one another, Ganmma radiation of a particular energy was selected by means of a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> <b>analyzer</b> and the 200 channel analyzer was used to analyze any coincident pulses frcm detector number two.

Five hour true and random counts were taken at each setting. Figure 2 shows the spectrum of gamma radiation of cerium- 144 -praseodymium- 144 in coincidence with the 34 kev gamma radiation. There is evidence for coincident radiation of 34, 55, 82 and 101 kev energy with only weak coincidences at 135 kev energy. Figure 3 shows the gamma ray spectrum of cerium- 144 -prasedymium- 144 in coincidence with the 80 kev gamma radiation.
