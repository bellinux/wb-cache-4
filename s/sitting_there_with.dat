500|$|Bakshi had {{originally}} intended to cast Drew Barrymore and Brad Pitt in the film's leading roles. Brad Pitt was cast as Frank Harris instead, with Gabriel Byrne as Deebs and Kim Basinger as Holli. The film's voice cast includes Maurice LaMarche, Charlie Adler and Candi Milo. According to Bakshi, Basinger had attempted to rewrite the film halfway into its production because she [...] "thought {{it would be great}} [...] if {{she would be able to}} show this picture in hospitals to sick children [...] I said, 'Kim, I think that's wonderful, but you've got the wrong guy to do that with.'

500|$|Among the Canadians, {{only two}} players were not suspended: goalie Jimmy Waite and forward Pierre Turgeon. [...] Waite {{felt he could}} not risk being ejected for {{fighting}} under {{the belief that the}} game would resume, and that the Canadian backup goaltender, Shawn Simpson, was injured. [...] Steve Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, but trying to help break the players apart. [...] Many of their teammates never forgave Turgeon for failing to defend his teammates. In the words of Everett Sanipass: [...] "I'm looking for someone to help (Stéphane) Roy out and I look over at the bench. [...] There's this dog Turgeon, just <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> <b>with</b> his head down. He wouldn't get his ass off the bench ... just sitting there when everyone's off the Soviet bench and at least one of our guys is in real trouble getting double-teamed." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift wrote [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] {{during her}} {{freshman}} year, {{knowing that she}} and her senior boyfriend, Brandon Borello, would break {{up at the end of}} the year when he left for college. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job writing songs for Sony/ATV [...] "with the idea and the melody. She knew exactly what she wanted." [...] The nostalgic song describes a summer romance and Swift's hope that when Borello [...] "think Tim McGraw" [...] he would [...] "think [...] favorite song" [...] – McGraw's [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothin" [...] – and remember her. Conversely, [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] describes a girl furious after a break-up. Swift says that while the song is about [...] "just being mad" [...] and is [...] "completely, brutally honest"; she gave it a comedic edge. While at work after school, Swift [...] "found self just <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> [...] guitar going, 'I hate his stupid truck that he doesn't let me drive. He's such a redneck! Oh my God!'," [...] a line which developed into the song's chorus. The up-tempo song is heavy with banjos and drums, while the chorus is marked by distorted guitars and big vocals.|$|E
60|$|And {{then she}} {{repeated}} to herself the words which Lily had spoken, <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> leaning <b>with</b> her elbow on her knee, {{and her head}} upon her hand.|$|R
5000|$|Milius {{said the}} film was a [...] "boy's {{adventure}} movie ... seen through children's eyes ... I'm sick of seeing children used {{as a point of}} view when they're <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> blanching <b>with</b> terror".|$|R
60|$|As he was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> chatting <b>with</b> Mr. and Mrs. Shrewsbury, he saw Kate Ellison {{come out}} of her father's gate along the road with her basket, as usual. Catching up his hat, he ran out and stood bareheaded, {{awaiting}} her.|$|R
2500|$|A four-track EP, Kill Kill Kill was {{released}} in 1985 containing cover versions of [...] "Kill Kill Kill" [...] originally by The Sacred Cows on [...] "The Groovy Guru" [...] episode of US comedy TV series, Get Smart; Australian group Supernaut's [...] "I Like it Both Ways"; The Ramones' [...] "Do You Remember Rock'n'Roll Radio?" [...] and The Saints' [...] "Know Your Product". Their first single, [...] "Basia!", released in March 1985 on Big Time Records, was a paean to Basia Bonkowski—lyrics include [...] "B she's so beautiful, A articulate too, S sensual, I international, Ay Ay" [...] and [...] "She's <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> her multi-coloured hair / She's <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> that multi-cultured stare"—who was presenter of SBS' music television show, Rock Around the World from 1982 to late 1984. A live album, Bucket, released in October 1986 on the band's own label Dock Records (distributed by Shock Records) and Big Time Records, featured one of their live pub rock performances.|$|E
2500|$|Keane {{has done}} media work but {{expressed}} {{his lack of}} enthusiasm to do so again in future when he said, [...] "I was asked last week by ITV to do the Celtic game," [...] he said. [...] "A {{couple of weeks before}} that I was asked to do the United game against Celtic at Old Trafford. I think I've done it once for Sky. Never again. I'd rather go to the dentist. You're <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> people like Richard Keys and they're trying to sell something that's not there." [...] Keane added, [...] "Any time I watch a game on television I have to turn the commentators off".|$|E
2500|$|Last Train to Paris {{is officially}} {{credited}} to Diddy – Dirty Money. The group was formed when Diddy asked former Danity Kane member, Dawn Richard, and singer-songwriter Kalenna Harper to perform alongside {{him on the}} album. In an interview with All Hip-Hop, Diddy said that Dirty Money is [...] "not about no drug money, illegal money, or anything negative". Instead he described it as [...] "a sound, a movement, [...] a crew", something fresh and unique for his new album. He explained that [...] "he wanted to tell a love story" [...] but needed Dirty Money because [...] "he couldn’t just tell the male’s point of view." [...] Further elaborating on the group's name, Diddy told Slant Magazine that its origins are dated back to 2005 when the group was at [...] "a strip club in Jacksonville, Florida, during the Super Bowl. People heard I was there, {{and all of a}} sudden so many people came in that I had to rush outside to my truck. I was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> a bunch of money and I was like, 'Damn, this is some dirty money.' A light bulb went off that day." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly described the group's role on the album as [...] "fleshing out Last Trains skeletal storyline, playing jealous lovers, disappointed partners, and commanding divas to his conflicted playboy." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News said that Dirty Money [...] "sing loudly, often and well -- a good thing", on the disk. [...] Henry Yanney of Soulculture said that Last Train to Paris was vocally-led Harper and Richard, who give the album [...] "attitude and style". He said [...] "the duo sing harmoniously and break into solos with much precision and pace, remaining in sync at all times with the abrasive club influenced beats on hand." [...] David Jeffries said that at times Dirty Money came off as [...] "fine background singers or part of Diddy’s Fashion Week posse." [...] Matt Sayles disagreed, stating that on the record, [...] "Diddy takes a backseat" [...] which allowed [...] "Kaleena and Dawn to do a lot of the heavy lifting (and breathing) on a wide range of songs." [...] Dirty Money was inspired by the 1980s bands Soul II Soul and Loose Ends though Diddy pointed out that he [...] "wanted to flip things" [...] by having two girls and one guy in the band. [...] "Two bad divas, one for the left and one for the right side of me". He told Amos Barshad from New York that [...] " [...] diamonds in the rough. These girls got a certain flavor and swagger, which is rare in this marketplace." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{should have}} thought Dick mad had not the cat been <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> before me <b>with</b> its eyes looking into mine. As it was, I only grew more {{interested}} in his tale.|$|R
60|$|On a cold {{afternoon}} in January, Sholto Douglas entered a hold in New York, and ascended {{to a room}} on the first floor. Marian was <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> thinking, <b>with</b> a letter in her lap, She only looked up for a moment when he entered; and he plucked off his sealskin gloves and threw aside his overcoat in silence.|$|R
60|$|He {{shook his}} head solemnly over his {{monotonous}} career, and, gazing at a war-club from Samoa which hung over the fireplace, put a few leading questions to the captain concerning {{the manner in which}} it came into his possession. When Prudence came in half an hour later he was still <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> listening <b>with</b> rapt attention to his host’s tales of distant seas.|$|R
60|$|She got up {{and came}} to his side; she could not speak <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> his eyes on her.|$|E
60|$|He was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Mrs. Archie. He {{was looking}} a bit dazed, {{but she was}} {{simmering}} with joy. She welcomed me as the faithful friend.|$|E

6000|$|Here--where the Waverley {{novels and}} Byron's works and Gibbon's Roman Empire and Humboldt's Cosmos, and the bronzes on the mantelpiece, and that {{masterpiece}} of the oily school, 'Dutch Fishing-Boats at Sunset,' were fixed as fate, {{and for all}} sign of change old Jolyon might have been <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> still, <b>with</b> legs crossed, in the arm chair, and domed forehead and deep eyes grave above The Times--here they came, those two grandchildren. And Jolly said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Er own {{daughter}} was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> beside 'er <b>with</b> 'alf a dozen silver bangles on 'er wrist, and {{a sort of}} thing 'anging around 'er neck, as, 'ad it been real, would 'ave been worth perhaps a thousand pounds. But Emma wanted a job, so she kept 'er thoughts to 'erself.|$|R
60|$|Those {{who saw him}} <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> so quietly, <b>with</b> {{his face}} resting on his hand, imagined, no doubt, that he was wrestling with some deep, {{abstract}} proposition, some great thought {{to be given to}} mankind; for there was that about Hilary which forced everyone to connect him instantly with the humaner arts.|$|R
60|$|When I spoke next, I {{was back}} in the school-house, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> my bonnet on my head, Gavin looking at me. We had {{forgotten}} the cannon at last.|$|E
60|$|At the {{threshold}} he paused. She had not {{looked up at}} him. She was still <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> bowed head and hidden face. He closed the door softly, and went out.|$|E
60|$|A lady in {{a velvet}} jacket was <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> <b>with</b> her {{eyes fixed on the}} ground. A {{flowering}} laurel, however, stood between, and, taking shelter behind this, young Jolyon prepared his easel.|$|E
5000|$|Once outside, {{she realizes}} {{that she does not}} have her bags. She returns to the cafeteria, and her bags are not in the booth she was sitting in. Anxious, she paces back and forth, not noticing that there are bags in the next cubicle. When she does notice, she sees a salad <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> along <b>with</b> her bags. Realizing that the man never {{actually}} stole her salad and instead was eating his own, she laughs, takes her bags, and leaves the restaurant.|$|R
5000|$|In December 1951, President Truman, {{described}} as being [...] "deeply moved," [...] decorated Mroz and Floyd Boring with silver lapel buttons for their roles in saving him. He said they were [...] "two straight-shooting secret service agents" [...] and gave them [...] Collazo survived and was put on trial in February 1951. At the trial, Mroz identified Collazo, [...] "He's <b>sitting</b> right <b>there</b> <b>with</b> a brown suit and a red tie and glasses on." [...] Collazo was convicted and imprisoned for decades.|$|R
60|$|In the North and East {{there is}} a popular idea that the {{frontier}} of the West is a thing long past, and remembered now only in stories. As I think of this I remember Ranger Sitter when he made that remark, while he grimly stroked an unhealed bullet wound. And I remember the giant Vaughn, that typical son of stalwart Texas, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> quietly <b>with</b> bandaged head, his thoughtful eye boding ill to the outlaw who had ambushed him. Only a few months have passed since then--when I had my memorable sojourn with you--and yet, in that short time, Russell and Moore have crossed the Divide, like Rangers.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, old 'un!' cried Fascination, in {{his light}} raillery, 'what dodgery {{are you up}} to next, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> your eyes shut? You ain't asleep. Catch a weasel at it, and catch a Jew!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] he said softly, [...] "is where I found Jimmy. He was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> {{his rifle}} on his knee, looking {{straight}} at me, {{as though there}} were lots of things he could tell me." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} midnight when Edgar {{returned}} from the settlement and saw, to his surprise, lights still burning in the homestead. Entering the living-room, he found Grierson <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Jake, and it struck him that they looked uneasy.|$|E
5000|$|... "Ive {{heard them}} all, but your Rectilinear III {{speakers}} are really wonderful! The sound is so natural that I feel that I am <b>sitting</b> in <b>there</b> right <b>with</b> the band. I am so {{very pleased with}} these speakers that I feel {{you should know about}} it."

6000|$|He went on {{with the}} air of one {{conscious}} of having said something fatal. [...] "We must get somebody to go across whom he will really listen to. He may be mad, but there's method in his madness. There nearly always is method in madness. It's what drives men mad, being methodical. And he never goes on <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> after sunset, <b>with</b> the whole place getting dark. Where's his nephew? I believe he's really fond of his nephew." ...|$|R
60|$|Sally {{had often}} pitied these birds, {{and more than}} once had pleaded in vain with Abrahams for a {{remission}} of their sentence, but somehow at this moment it did not occur to her that this one was merely praying in its own language, as she often had prayed in her thoughts, {{to be taken out}} of this place. To her, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> wrestling <b>with</b> Fate, the song seemed cheerful. It soothed her. It healed her to listen to it. And suddenly before her eyes there rose a vision of Monk's Crofton, cool, green, and peaceful under the mild English sun, luring her as an oasis seen in the distance lures the desert traveller...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not sure}} of that. She has no conversation, you see; not a word. She has been <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Lord Dumbello at her elbow for the last hour, and yet she has hardly opened her mouth three times." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What in {{the world}} is my girl {{thinking}} about all alone here, with such a solemn face?" [...] asked Dr. Alec, coming into the study, one November day, to find Rose <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> folded hands and a very thoughtful aspect.|$|E
60|$|I frowned. It {{seemed to}} me the affair had now gone much too far. Lord Porthoning had {{staggered}} to a chair and was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> his face buried in his hands. He was a stricken man. I turned to my father-in-law.|$|E
5000|$|One {{theme of}} the story is the {{difficulty}} of meaningful political participation in such a widely dispersed polity as China. Another theme is the life and death impact politics is able to make on people, even down at the village level. [...] "I don't think the emperor will ascend the throne. I passed Mr. Chao's wine shop today, and he was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> reading again, <b>with</b> his queue coiled {{on the top of his}} head. He wasn't wearing his long gown, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{terror and}} horror that frail and faded woman threw into the one word fairly startled Gwendoline. She {{opened her eyes}} and stared aghast at her mother. And well she might, for the effect was electrical. Mrs. Gildersleeve was <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> transfixed <b>with</b> awe and some unspeakable alarm; her figure was rigid; her face was dead white; her mouth was drawn down with a convulsive twitch; she clasped her bloodless hands on her knees in mute agony. For a moment she sat there like a statue of flesh. Then, as sense and feeling came back to her by slow degrees, she could but rock her body up and down in her chair with a short swaying motion, and mutter over and over again to herself in that same appalled and terrified voice, [...] "Mambury--Mambury--Mambury--Mambury." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{forgot the}} plow and the reaper while <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> in conference <b>with</b> those men {{for they were}} thinkers as well as warriors. Within the walls of that lodge they were not despised outcasts, they were leaders, councillors, men of weight. They had reëntered a world which caused their faces to shine just as my father's face shone when he told of Grant at Vicksburg or recounted the days of his youth on The Old Wisconse. For a little while I {{inhabited}} their world, and when I left them I carried with me a deepened sense of their essential manliness.|$|R
