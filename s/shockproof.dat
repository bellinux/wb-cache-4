25|$|On 15 July 1951, Straffen {{went to the}} cinema, on his own. His route {{took him}} past 1 Camden Crescent in Bath, where 5-year-old Brenda Goddard lived with her foster parents. According to Straffen's later {{statement}} to the police, he saw Brenda gathering flowers and offered to show her a better place. He lifted Brenda over a fence into a copse, after which she fell and hit her head on a stone. She was unconscious, and he strangled her. Straffen did not make any attempt to hide the body and simply {{went on to the}} cinema (to see the film <b>Shockproof)</b> and returned home.|$|E

50|$|While {{the basic}} K-26 design {{was shared by}} these manufacturers, some of them carried on {{building}} watches using movements of the same fundamental design under various names, incorporating further refinements and alterations, such as <b>shockproofing,</b> and automatic day/date indicators. For instance, Petrodvorets used brand names including Lotos, Majak ("Маяк", Lighthouse), Neva ("Нева", the Neva River), Start ("Старт"), Svet ("Свет", Light), and Raketa (Ракета, Rocket), which eventually became the firm's single brand name from 1962. The Chistopol plant produced Chaika ("Чайка", Seagull), Druschba ("Дружба", Friendship), Jantar ("Янтарь", Amber), Kama ("Кама", River Kama), Kolos ("Колос", Spike), Raduga ("Радуга", Rainbow), Rubin ("Рубин"), Saturn ("Сатурн"), Uran ("Уран"), and Vostok, which became the standard brand for the company.|$|R

30|$|Therefore, {{methods for}} {{improving}} the electrochemical properties of Si electrodes are of high interest, and extensive {{research has been conducted}} to solve the problems associated with the Si electrode, such as using electrodes with a carbon (C) composite composition, multidimensional structures, and metal-alloyed forms [6 – 12]. In particular, for active material methods used in <b>shockproofing,</b> many studies have pursued approaches for coating the subject with various materials [13 – 16]. Conductive materials such as carbon, metal alloys, and even conductive polymers have been employed to restrain the expansion effect, and they have provided not only a buffering effect but also charge transportation enhancement. However, these research methods have limitations regarding their use in commercial applications because of their detailed fabrication procedures.|$|R
