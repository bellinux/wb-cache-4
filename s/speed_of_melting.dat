In the cold room, previously cut one meter ice core sticks of 3 x 3 cm, are melted continuously on a heated melter head specifically designed to eliminate contamination from the atmosphere or by the external parts of the ice. The melted ice from the most inner part of the ice stick is continuously pumped by a peristaltic pump and carried to a clean lab by Teflon lines. The recorded signal is continuous, integrating a sample volume of about 0. 05 mL, for which the temporal resolution depends on the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>melting,</b> ice density and snow accumulation rate at the ice core drilling site. For annual accumulation derived from the WAIS and Law Dome ice cores, we assumed ~ 3. 1 cm water equivalent uncertainty in each year's accumulation from short scale spatial variability (glaciological noise) which was determined from several measurements of annual accumulation in multiple parallel ice cores notably from the WAIS Divide ice core site (Banta et al., 2008) and from South Pole site (McConnell et al., 1997; McConnell et al., 2000). Refractory black carbon (rBC) concentrations were determined using the same method as in (Bisiaux et al., 2011) and adapted to continuous flow measurements as described by (McConnell et al., 2007).

The results of erosion {{studies show that the}} runoff {{generated}} in the cold period can cause more intensive erosion than in the warm half year. By analysis of the monthly catchment of suspended sediments, it was found maximum of suspended sediments in the spring likely as effect of the spring melting of snow. Erosion caused by water from melting snow in our conditions does not reach the same intensity as the erosion caused by torrential rainfall. However, the torrential rainfall has only a local character, while the spring melting of snow usually affects larger territory. Erosive potential of water stored in snow cover can be established {{on the basis of the}} quantity of water resulting from melting snow and the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> snow. Erosion caused by melting snow is given by quantity and the maximum speed of water runoff, which may be enhanced by rainfall, occurring in parallel with the snow melting. The total soil loss due to melting snow is also influenced by other factors: soil moisture, which affects the size of infiltration, soil freezing, the topography, the protective effect of vegetation, soil erodibility and implemented erosion control measures. The work analyzed erosive potential of snow cover during the cold period 1981 / 82 to 2007 / 2008 for the part of the Czech Republic, which falls within the scope of the Brno branch of the Czech Hy­dro­me­teo­ro­lo­gi­cal Institute (CHMI).

40|$|The {{ultrahigh}} {{demand for}} faster computers is currently tackled by traditional {{methods such as}} size scaling (for {{increasing the number of}} devices), but this is rapidly becoming almost impossible, due to physical and lithographic limitations. To boost the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> computers without increasing the number of logic devices, one of the most feasible solutions is {{to increase the number of}} operations performed by a device, which is largely impossible to achieve using current silicon-based logic devices. Multiple operations in phase-change–based logic devices have been achieved using crystallization; however, they can achieve mostly <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> several hundreds of nanoseconds. A difficulty also arises from the trade-off between the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> crystallization and long-term stability of the amorphous phase. We here instead control the process <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> through premelting disordering effects, while maintaining the superior advantage of phase-change–based logic devices over silicon-based logic devices.

40|$|The {{literature}} on atomization <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> has been reviewed. Models {{have been developed}} and applied to analyze the phenomena associated with centrifugal atomization <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> using rotating disk method. Some suggestions and guidelines for the development and operation of a centrifugal atomizer have been given. Previous experiments <b>of</b> <b>melt</b> atomization and present observations of water disintegration {{at the edge of}} a rotating disk have confirmed that the disintegration <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> or water occurs in one of three basic modes: direct droplet formation (DDF), ligament formation (LF) and film formation (FF). Wave theories have been used to analyze the disintegration <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> in the different regimes. The equations for the fastest growing wave number have been derived. Models for the calculation of powder particle sizes have been suggested and the calculated results have compared with available experimental data in the literature. Calculations have shown that disk diameter and disk rotating speed are two very important atomizing parameters. The type <b>of</b> <b>melt</b> and melt superheat also affect the powder particles size. In general, fine powder particles can be obtained by increasing disk rotating speed and using large diameter disk, provided that the melt does not solidify on the disk. In the DDF regime waves forming at the periphery of a disk are responsible for the break up <b>of</b> <b>melts.</b> The fastest growing wave number depends on the disk speed, disk diameter and properties <b>of</b> <b>melt.</b> In the FF regime sheet wave theory of Dombrowski and Johns was used to study the collapse <b>of</b> the <b>melt</b> sheet. The fastest growing wave number is a complex function <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> and thickness <b>of</b> film and the properties <b>of</b> <b>melt</b> and atomizer atmosphere. The effects of disk diameter, disk rotating speed and melt flow rate on atomization are achieved through influencing the <b>speed</b> and thickness <b>of</b> film. The studies on the flow <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> on rotating disks have shown that the film forming on the disk was very thin, about tens of microns and the tangential velocity <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> was much higher than the radial velocity. The analysis of heat transfer <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> on a rotating disk has shown that partial solidification <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> on the disk is possible. To obtain a good atomization condition it is necessary to control the partial freezing <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> on the disk. A large melt superheat and a high melt flow rate are required to prevent melts from freezing on the disk. The use of a small diameter disk can also avoid freezing <b>of</b> the <b>melt</b> on the disk. Combining the calculations of heat transfer on the disk with the prediction of wave theory for particle sizes, it is shown that a disk of small diameter rotating at high speed is desirable for the production of fine powders. The cooling ability obtained by centrifugal atomization using the rotating disk method depends on the design of atomizer, the operating conditions and the type of material to be atomized. A large diameter disk on which solidification <b>of</b> <b>melt</b> is avoided and a high disk rotating speed result to the formation of fine powder particles which experience a high cooling rate. The nucleation undercooling <b>of</b> <b>melt</b> depends on particle size, disk speed, material to be atomized and the nucleation condition. A small particle size and a high disk speed lead to a large undercooling. The times for the completion of solidification of powder particle of typical sizes produced by centrifugal atomization have been calculated and their effects on the atomizer vessel diameter have been discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Mass-energy {{equivalence}} {{also holds}} in macroscopic systems. [...] For example, if one takes exactly one kilogram of ice, and applies heat, {{the mass of}} the resulting melt-water will be more than a kilogram: it will include the mass from the thermal energy (latent heat) used to melt the ice; this follows from the conservation of energy. This number is small but not negligible: about 3.7 nanograms. It is given by the latent heat <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> ice (334 kJ/kg) divided by the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light squared (c2 = 9&times;1016 m2/s2).|$|R
40|$|The {{dependence}} {{of physical and}} mechanical properties of manganese steel grade 110 H 13 L {{on the effect of}} electrical activity during crystallization of the casting is considered. Treatment <b>of</b> the <b>melt</b> by electric current increases the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> dissolution of metallic impurities and other components in the melt many times, providing not only finely crystalline structure, but also improving the homogeneity of metal casting. Improvement of mechanical properties is a consequence of crushing those which constitute microstructure. Processing by electric current does a beneficial effect on the process of crystallization <b>of</b> metal <b>melts</b> during casting, which significantly improves the structure of the ingot and its mechanical properties...|$|R
