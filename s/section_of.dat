40|$|Abstract. To {{localize}} {{factors that}} guide axons reinnervating skeletal muscle, we cultured ciliary ganglion neurons on cryostat <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> innervated and denervated adult muscle. Neurons extended neurites on <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> muscle (and several other tissues), generally in close apposition to sectioned cell surfaces. Average neurite length was greater on <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> denervated than on <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> innervated muscle, supporting {{the existence of}} functionally important differences between innervated and denervated muscle fiber surfaces. Furthermore, outgrowth was greater on <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> denervated muscle cut from endplate-rich regions than on sections from endplate-free regions, suggesting that a neurite outgrowth-promoting factor is concentrated near synapses.
