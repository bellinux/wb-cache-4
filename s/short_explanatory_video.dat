50|$|The {{main problem}} with depictions is {{defining}} {{what constitutes a}} mythological scene, for any given scene might in principle also represent a moment in a ritual sequence, a visual metaphor stemming from oral literature, a scene from mundane life, or a historical event. It is, in any case, clear that the Twin myth - albeit in a version which considerably diverged from the Popol Vuh - already circulated in the Classic Period. In some cases, ancient Mayan myths may only have been preserved by neighboring peoples; the narrative of the principal Maya maize god, and, to a lesser extent, that of the Bacabs are cases in point. As the process of hieroglyphic decipherment proceeds, the <b>short</b> <b>explanatory</b> captions often included within the scenes will hopefully be restored to their original eloquence, and make ancient narrative come to life more fully.|$|R
