50|$|As the Federal Reserve {{maintained}} {{low interest}} rates to favor economic growth, a housing bubble {{began to appear in}} the United States. In 2007, the rise in interest rates and the collapse of the housing market caused a wave of loan payment failures in the U.S. The <b>subsequent</b> <b>mortgage</b> crisis caused a global financial crisis, because the subprime mortgages had been securitized and sold to international banks and investment funds. Despite the extensive intervention of central banks, including partial and total nationalization of major European banks, the crisis of sovereign debt became particularly acute, first in Iceland, though as events of the early 2010s would show, it was not an isolated European example. Economic activity was severely affected around the world in 2008 and 2009, with disastrous consequences for carmakers.|$|E
50|$|Baroness Hale {{identified}} that the onus is upon the person seeking {{to show that}} the beneficial ownership is different from the legal ownership and that the key question in cases such as this is “did the parties intend their beneficial interests to be different from their legal interests?”, although she acknowledged that cases of this type would be very unusual. Baroness Hale stated that, contrary to Lloyd's Bank plc v Rosset, many factors other than financial contributions may be relevant to divining the parties' true intentions, such as any discussions {{at the time of the}} transfer which cast light upon their intentions; the reasons why the home was acquired in their joint names; the nature of their relationship; whether they had children for whom they both had responsibility to provide a home; how the purchase was financed, both the initial purchase price and the <b>subsequent</b> <b>mortgage</b> payments; how the parties arranged their finances, whether separately or together or a bit of both; how they discharged their household expenses. Baroness Hale stated that these and other factors should be taken into account when deciding whether the parties' beneficial interests should be different from their legal interests and whether a constructive trust existed. Because the parties had kept their finances rigidly separate, Baroness Hale was of the opinion that, taking their entire course of conduct into account, the appeal by Mr Stack should be dismissed and the Court of Appeal's order of a 65/35 split in favour of Ms Dowden should stand.|$|E

50|$|Shotgunning: Occurs when {{multiple}} {{loans for}} the same home are obtained simultaneously for a total amount greatly {{in excess of the}} actual value of the property. These schemes leave lenders exposed to large losses because the <b>subsequent</b> <b>mortgages</b> are junior to the first mortgage to be recorded and the property value is insufficient for the subsequent lenders to collect against the property in foreclosure. The Matthew Cox and Robert Douglas Hartmann cases are the most notable example of this type of scheme. The result of this fraud is that lenders often litigate which has first priority to the property.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} use of {{simultaneous}} close junior lien lending ("piggybacks") {{over the course of}} the recent housing bubble and <b>subsequent</b> <b>mortgage</b> market collapse. Using both state-level and Zip code-level data over the period 2001 - 2008, we find that the fraction of piggyback originations is related to higher foreclosure and default rates in subsequent years, and this relation is strongest for non-owner-occupied properties. The pattern, however, appears to be limited to {{the use of}} subprime piggybacks, rather than a more general phenomenon. Using a topology-based housing supply elasticity measure as an instrument for house price growth, we further confirm that the strong association of subprime piggyback origination with worse loan performance was not driven by the endogeneity of house price appreciation.

50|$|Bridge {{loans are}} often used for {{commercial}} real estate purchases to quickly close on a property, retrieve real estate from foreclosure, or {{take advantage of a}} short-term opportunity in order to secure long-term financing.

5000|$|One rapid response, in December 1914, was the {{creation}} by the Cantonal government of the Graubünden Credit Co-operative (Bündner Kreditgenossenschaft), {{with the objective of}} preserving intrinsically viable enterprises and minimizing losses of value ("zur Durchhaltung lebensfähiger Unternehmungen und zur Verhinderung des Untergangs bedeutender Werte").

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a rapid {{expansion in the}} supply of mortgages driven by disintermediation explains a large fraction of recent U. S. house price appreciation and <b>subsequent</b> <b>mortgage</b> defaults. We identify the effect of shifts in the supply of mortgage credit by exploiting within-county variation across zip codes that differed in latent demand for mortgages in the mid 1990 s. From 2001 to 2005, high latent demand zip codes experienced large relative decreases in denial rates, increases in mortgages originated, and increases in house price appreciation, {{despite the fact that}} these zip codes experienced significantly negative relative income and employment growth over this time period. These patterns for high latent demand zip codes were driven by a sharp relative increase in the fraction of loans sold by originators shortly after origination, a process which we refer to as "disintermediation. " The increase in disintermediation-driven mortgage supply to high latent demand zip codes from 2001 to 2005 led to subsequent large increases in mortgage defaults from 2005 to 2007. Our results suggest that moral hazard on behalf of originators selling mortgages is a main culprit for the U. S. mortgage default crisis. ...|$|E
40|$|Misstatement {{of income}} on {{mortgage}} loan applications (the “liar-loan ” problem) {{is thought to}} have been a contributor to the boom and bust of mortgage markets. We provide nationwide measurements that reflect the degree to which incomes on mid- 2000 home-purchase mortgage loan applications were overstated relative to the actual incomes of mortgage applicants. Our results suggest a substantial degree of income overstatement in 2005 and 2006, one consistent with the average mortgage application overstating income by almost 20 percent. We find the tendency to misstate income was influenced by securitization markets. We find limited evidence that income overstatement played a role in <b>subsequent</b> <b>mortgage</b> defaults. *Helpful comments were provided by seminar participants at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

40|$|U. S. households' debt skyrocketed between 2000 and 2007, but {{has since}} been falling. This {{leveraging}} and deleveraging cycle cannot {{be accounted for by}} the liberalization and <b>subsequent</b> tightening of <b>mortgage</b> credit standards that occurred during the period. We base this conclusion on a quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated using macroeconomic aggregates and microeconomic data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. From the perspective of the model, the credit cycle is more likely due to factors that impacted house prices more directly, thus affecting the availability of credit through a collateral channel. In either case, the macroeconomic consequences of leveraging and deleveraging are relatively minor because the responses of borrowers and lenders roughly wash out in the aggregate...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the United States housing bubble and the <b>subsequent</b> {{subprime}} <b>mortgage</b> crisis there has been increased interest in renegotiation or modification of the mortgage loans rather than foreclosure, and some commentators have speculated that the crisis was exacerbated by the [...] "unwillingness of lenders to renegotiate mortgages". Several policies, including the U.S. Treasury sponsored Hope Now initiative and the 2009 [...] "Making Home Affordable" [...] plan have offered incentives to renegotiate mortgages. Renegotiations can include lowering the principal due or temporarily reducing the interest rate. A 2009 study by Federal Reserve economists found that even using a broad definition of renegotiation, only 3% of [...] "seriously delinquent borrowers" [...] received a modification. The leading theory attributes the lack of renegotiation to securitization and a large number of claimants with security interest in the mortgage. There is some support behind this theory, but an analysis of the data found that renegotiation rates were similar among unsecuritized and securitized mortgages. The authors of the analysis argue that banks don't typically renegotiate because they expect to make more money with a foreclosure, as renegotiation imposes [...] "self-cure" [...] and [...] "redefault" [...] risks.Government supported programs such as Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) may provide homeowners the ability to refinance their mortgages if they are unable to obtain a traditional refinance due to their declined home value.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} payment shocks on {{subprime}} hybrid ARM mortgage prepayment and delinquency is examined. Using loan level data from private label securities, we modeled {{the effects of}} payment shocks on mortgage performance. Our study provided interesting empirical results in three main areas: First, we addressed the effect of payment shocks on <b>subsequent</b> <b>mortgage</b> delinquency. Second, we studied how the effect of payment shocks varies and decays over time. Third, we disentangled the impact of payment shocks based on {{the reason for the}} shocks: payment shock due to the expiration of a teaser rate (i. e. "teaser shock") versus the payment shock due to index rate changes at the time of reset (i. e. "market rate shock"). We find that the effect of payment shock on loan performance varies by the delinquency status of the loan {{at the time of the}} shock. That is, the payment shock has the most significant effect on "current" loans rather than loans already in delinquency. Also of note, we find that the effect of a payment shock decays only gradually over time. We find that the impact of "teaser shocks" and "market rate shocks" on mortgage performance do not differ substantially, even though teaser shocks may be somewhat more predictable than market rate shocks. This suggests that either subprime ARM borrowers did not fully understand the product and the extent of the shock at the first reset date or that financially strapped borrowers used the product to speculate and were caught by the teaser shock when they were unable to refinance or sell (i. e. "flip") their properties. The study suggests that any modification plan designed to eliminate potential payment shocks or to otherwise lower payments will be most effective for loans that are currently performing rather than loans that are already in delinquency.

40|$|Lowering of {{underwriting}} standards {{may have contributed}} much to the unprecedented recent rise and <b>subsequent</b> fall of <b>mortgage</b> volumes and house prices. Conventional data do not satisfactorily measure aggregate {{underwriting standards}} over the past decade: the easing and then tightening of underwriting, inside and especially outside of banks, was likely much more extensive than they indicate. Given mortgage market developments since the mid- 1990 s, the method of principal components produces a superior indicator of mortgage underwriting standards. We show that the resulting indicator better fits the variation over time in the laxity and tightness of underwriting. Based on a vector auto-regression, we then show how conditions affected underwriting standards. The results also show that our new indicator of underwriting helps account for the behavior of mortgage volumes, house prices, and gross domestic product during the recent boom in mortgage and housing markets. ...|$|R
40|$|The recent U. S. {{consumption}} {{boom and}} the <b>subsequent</b> surge in <b>mortgage</b> defaults {{have been linked}} to mortgage equity withdrawals (MEWs). MEWs are correlated with covariates consistent with a permanent income framework augmented for credit-constraints. Nevertheless, many households are financially illiterate. We assess the unexplored linkages between “active MEW” and measures of financial literacy using panel data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Findings indicate that declines in mortgage interest rates encouraged MEWs. Nevertheless, financially illiterate households {{were significantly more likely to}} withdraw housing equity via traditional first or second mortgages (including cash-out mortgage refinancings but not home equity loans). >; We find that the financially less savvy are 3 – 5 percentage points more likely to engage in this type of MEW relative to those who answered financial literacy questions correctly.

40|$|The U. S. economy {{experienced}} a dramatic {{rise in the}} price of owner occupied housing during 1999 - 2007, and then a precipitous decline from 2007 through 2009. In this paper we utilize data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) during 1999 – 2009 to study first the factors and borrowing decisions which were related to the run-up and then to see how these diverse positions in owner-occupied housing related to the <b>subsequent</b> difficulties and <b>mortgage</b> distress as of 2009. Our research shows that much of the rise and subsequent difficulties were concentrated among younger and less educated homeowners, and that the difficulties were also concentrated in selected real estate markets where home owners were allocating a substantial share of their income to debt service and other home related outlays such as taxes, utilities, and insurance. This pattern of high costs to support a housing position is interpreted {{as the result of a}} speculative price run-up supported by the joint decisions of the homeowners and their lenders. I...|$|R
40|$|The United States (US) {{subprime}} crisis, {{driven by}} the decline in US house prices and the <b>subsequent</b> threats of <b>mortgage</b> defaults, has had a significant (negative) impact on financial markets. From 2006 onwards, threats of US mortgage loan defaults heightened and prices of collateralized asset-backed securities (ABS) containing subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations (CDO) tumbled, all of which resulted in an almost complete halt in trading and disruption in the normal price discovery process. Furthermore, financial markets suffered from significant recessionary expectations as both market and funding liquidity shrunk within the financial system. Caruana and Kodres (2008) {{point out that the}} average maturity of US short-term asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) shortened by six days with outstanding ABCP declines amounting to approximately $ 300 billion from August 2007 onwards. As the liquidity of both money markets and structured credit markets withered, the ability of banking institutions to raise external funds was severely impaired. Meanwhile, the level of interbank lending also declined as evidenced by the widening of LIBOR overnight index swap spreads. These national effects evolved into a global (and catastrophic) context, and was followed by a series of collapses and bailouts of renowned financial institutions, most notably, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Washington Mutual, AIG, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. All of these effects led to a prolonged period of global economic recession characterized by frequent injections of liquidity and rescue actions by central banks and government authorities...|$|R
40|$|By {{looking beyond}} the {{financial}} characteristics of borrowers, this research brings {{to light the}} social factors that influence a borrower's choice of a lender and mortgage product. Previous {{research has indicated that}} distinct channels exist that funnel borrowers into lower or higher cost loan products (Apgar, Bendimerad, and Essene 2007). But little is known as to how borrowers seek out or are directed to such channels. A particular concern that this paper hopes to address is why black borrowers disproportionately have higher priced products. Some research indicates that even when credit worthiness is controlled for, blacks are overrepresented in the subprime sector and in higher-cost products (Bocian, Ernst, and Li 2006). Through in-depth interviews with 32 borrowers, this research (1) highlights how borrowers seek mortgage credit and evaluate their mortgage options, and (2) demonstrates how borrowers make use of their social networks (friends and family) when making their decisions. The preliminary findings indicate that borrowers' preferences and <b>subsequent</b> demands for <b>mortgage</b> products were shaped by the informal and formal advice they received. Those borrowers who consulted the most diverse sources of information had loans with lower interest rates. Those borrowers who received advice only from family and friends did not fare {{as well as those who}} received help from credit counselors. Thus, arguably, their loan outcomes varied not just based on if they consulted others, but especially whom they consulted. When given the right advice, potential homebuyers make better decisions in choosing both a lender and a loan...|$|R
