50|$|An {{intervening}} cause {{is an event}} that occurs after a tortfeasor's initial act of negligence and causes injury/harm to a victim. An {{intervening cause}} will generally absolve the tortfeasor of liability for the victim's injury only if the event is deemed a <b>superseding</b> <b>cause.</b> A <b>superseding</b> <b>cause</b> is an unforeseeable intervening cause. By contrast, a foreseeable intervening cause typically does not break the chain of causality, meaning that the tortfeasor is still responsible for the victim's injury—unless the event leads to an unforeseeable result.|$|E
40|$|A mentally {{handicapped}} female {{working for}} Safeway Stores, Inc. was sexually assaulted at work by {{an employee of}} a company that provided janitorial services for Safeway. The assaults occurred in a storage room and in the parking lot while she was gathering shopping carts. She filed a complaint against Safeway and the janitorial company, Action Cleaning, alleging five causes of action {{as a result of the}} sexual assault. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Safeway, determining that Safeway was immune from suit because of coverage provided by the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act (the “NIIA”). The district court also granted summary judgment in favor of Action Cleaning pursuant to NRS 41. 745 because it was not liable for intentional torts committed by its employee and because the employee’s intervening criminal acts were a <b>superseding</b> <b>cause</b> that relieved Action Cleaning of responsibility. The Nevada Supreme Court concluded that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Safeway and Action Cleaning. The Court also took the opportunity to clarify that the “slightest doubt” standard in Nevada’s summary judgment jurisprudence was an incorrect statement of the law and should no longer be used when analyzing motions for summary judgment. The Court formally adopted the federal standard for summary judgment...|$|E
40|$|This article {{identifies}} {{and discusses}} the three principal {{limitations on the}} extent of legal responsibility for tortiously caused harm and explains and justifies them by reference to the principle of interactive justice, which holds one legally responsible for causing (or being imminently about to cause) harm to another 2 ̆ 7 s person or property as a result of conduct that is inconsistent with others 2 ̆ 7 right to equal freedom. The three principal limitations prevent liability for a tortiously caused harm when (1) the harm almost certainly would have occurred anyway {{in the absence of any}} tortious conduct or condition (the 2 ̆ 2 no worse off 2 ̆ 2 limitation), (2) there was a <b>superseding</b> <b>cause</b> of the harm (an actual cause of the harm that (i) intervened between the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s tortious conduct and the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s injury, (ii) was a necessary (2 ̆ 2 but for 2 ̆ 2) cause of the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s injury, and (iii) was highly unexpected), or (3) the harm did not occur as part of the realization and playing out of one of the foreseeable risks that made the person 2 ̆ 7 s conduct tortious, before the hazards created by the realization of that risk had dissipated (the 2 ̆ 2 risk playout 2 ̆ 2 limitation). None of the three limitations match the usual academic prescription for limiting the extent of legal responsibility for tortiously caused harm, which would rely solely on a harm-matches-the-risk (2 ̆ 2 harm-risked 2 ̆ 2) limitation that is often confused with, but which differs significantly from, the risk-playout limitation. However, as this article demonstrates, the results reached by the courts are consistent with the three stated limitations rather than the harm-risked limitation, despite the longstanding efforts of the academic drafters of the Restatements to install the harm-risked limitation as the sole, comprehensive limitation {{on the extent of}} legal responsibility for tortiously caused harm. These three limitations are neither exclusive nor absolute. Some of them do not apply or apply less broadly to some intentional torts and some strict liability actions. Moreover, there are other limitations on the extent of legal responsibility, such as the de-minimis-contribution limitation, as well as limitations on legal responsibility for certain types of losses - such as pure emotional distress, pure economic loss, and wrongful birth - that are more appropriately handled as categorical limitations on the scope of a person 2 ̆ 7 s duty rather than as limitations on the extent of legal responsibility for tortiously caused harm...|$|E

2500|$|Proximate cause {{means that}} you {{must be able to}} show that the harm was caused by the tort you are suing for. The defense may argue that there was a prior <b>cause</b> or a <b>superseding</b> {{intervening}} <b>cause.</b> A common situation where a prior cause becomes an issue is the personal injury car accident, where the person re-injures an old injury. For example, someone who has a bad back is injured in the back in a car accident. Years later he is still in pain. He must prove the pain is caused by the car accident, and not the natural progression of the previous problem with the back. [...] A <b>superseding</b> intervening <b>cause</b> happens shortly after the injury. For example, if after the accident the doctor who works on you commits malpractice and injures you further, the defense can argue that it was not the accident, but the incompetent doctor who caused your injury.|$|R

50|$|Technical {{obsolescence}} usually {{occurs when}} a new product or technology supersedes the old, and it becomes preferred {{to use the new}} technology in place of the old. Historical examples of <b>superseding</b> technologies <b>causing</b> obsolescence include bronze replacing flint in handtools, higher-quality multimedia DVD over videocassette recorder and the telephone, with audio transmission, over the telegraph's coded electrical signals. On a smaller scale, particular products may become obsolete due to replacement by a newer version of the product. Many products in the computer industry become obsolete in this manner; for example, Central processing units frequently become obsolete in favor of newer, faster units. Singularly, rapid obsolescence of data formats along with their supporting hardware and software can lead to loss of critical information, a process known as digital obsolescence.|$|R

40|$|That PhD {{candidates}} fail {{to graduate}} on time {{in large numbers}} across {{a number of countries}} is a well-known fact. An extreme example is Estonia, where according to some estimates {{less than a third of}} PhD students complete their studies on time. A number of studies have addressed the likely reasons for such behavior, both comparatively and country-specifically, but empirical evidence is controversial and scant. To remedy the situation, we use the population data of Estonian doctoral students in order to explain the abysmal success rate. Findings suggest that student's age and academic leave increase the probability to drop out. Contrary to the expectations, we find no evidence that drop out rates cluster around certain fields of studies. Furthermore, we argue that structural reasons <b>supersede</b> individual <b>causes</b> of failure and therefore instead of increasing the number of PhD positions to meet the demands of the labor market, the policy must incentivize doctoral candidates to stay fully engaged in their studies and subsequently graduate within nominal time limits. Our findings have profound implications regarding the higher education policy...|$|R

It was established that stability of a vitreous state is defined by a ratio of ZnO / (PbO + B [2]O[3]) in the glass composition. Dependences of thermal and rheological characteristics of glass systems of ZnO – PbO – B[2]O[3] from a chemical composition are studied. The increase in the maintenance of B[2]O[3] <b>superseded</b> by PbO <b>causes</b> the essential growth of viscosity and decreas e of its gradient. The components able to reduce viscosity are arranged in the following way: B[2]O[3]→ZnO →PbO. By the results of research of glass rheological properties of ZnO – PbO – B[2]O[3] system, the area of glass compositions with viscosity less than 10 { 5 } Pa · s at a temperature not over 450 °C that provides the demanded spreadability indicators is defined. Regulation of indicators of TCLE is reached by creation of compositions glass – a crystal filler. Influence of such crystal filler as zircon, spodumene, cordierite on properties of composite glass-ceramic cement is re searched. The target TCLE indexes being equal to (77 ± 1) · 10 {– 7 } K{– 1 } are achieved {{by the introduction of}} a spodumene. The composite glass-ceramic cement, intended for vacuum-tight connections of fiber-optical elements with a metal frame was developed. TCLE indexes of the glass-ceramic cement are equal to 77. 2 · 10 {– 7 } K{– 1 }, that coordinates it with TCLE containing a fiber-optical element.
