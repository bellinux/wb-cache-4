25|$|It is {{relatively}} superficial at its start, {{where it is}} contained in the carotid triangle of the neck, and lies behind and medial to the external carotid, overlapped by the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and covered by the deep fascia, the platysma, and integument: it then passes beneath the parotid gland, being crossed by the hypoglossal nerve, the digastric muscle and the stylohyoid muscle, the occipital artery and the posterior auricular artery. Higher up, it is separated from the external carotid by the <b>styloglossus</b> and stylopharyngeus muscles, {{the tip of the}} styloid process and the stylohyoid ligament, the glossopharyngeal nerve and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve. It is in relation, behind, with the longus capitis, the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk, and the superior laryngeal nerve; laterally, with the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve, the nerve lying on a plane posterior to the artery; medially, with the pharynx, superior laryngeal nerve, and ascending pharyngeal artery. At the base of the skull the glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory, and hypoglossal nerves lie between the artery and the internal jugular vein.|$|E
500|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve provides motor {{control of the}} extrinsic muscles of the tongue: genioglossus, hyoglossus, <b>styloglossus,</b> and the intrinsic muscles of the tongue. These represent all muscles of the tongue except the palatoglossus muscle. [...] The {{hypoglossal nerve}} is of a general somatic efferent (GSE) type.|$|E
500|$|At a {{point at}} the level of the angle of the mandible, the {{hypoglossal}} nerve emerges from behind the [...] posterior belly of the digastric muscle. It then loops around a branch of the occipital artery and travels forward into the region beneath the mandible. The hypoglossal nerve moves forward deep to the hyoglossus and stylohyoid muscles and lingual nerve. It continues deep to the genioglossus muscle and continues forward to the tip of the tongue. It distributes branches to the intrinsic and extrinsic muscle of the tongue innervates as it passes in this direction, and supplies several muscles (hyoglossus, genioglossus and <b>styloglossus)</b> that it passes.|$|E

50|$|The <b>styloglossus</b> draws up {{the sides}} of the tongue to create a trough for swallowing. As a pair they also aid in {{retracting}} the tongue.|$|E
50|$|The <b>styloglossus</b> is {{innervated by}} the Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) like all {{muscles of the}} tongue except palatoglossus which is innervated by the Pharyngeal plexus of vagus nerve (CN X).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Styloglossus,</b> the {{shortest}} and {{smallest of the}} three styloid muscles, arises from the anterior and lateral surfaces of the styloid process near its apex, and from the stylomandibular ligament.|$|E
50|$|It {{extends from}} the root to {{the apex of the}} tongue: behind, some of its fibers are {{connected}} with the body of the hyoid bone; in front it blends with the fibers of the <b>Styloglossus.</b>|$|E
50|$|A trough is then {{formed at}} the back of the tongue by the {{intrinsic}} muscles (XII). The trough obliterates against the hard palate from front to back, forcing the bolus to the back of the tongue.The intrinsic muscles of the tongue (XII) contract to make a trough (a longitudinal concave fold) {{at the back}} of the tongue. The tongue is then elevated to the roof of the mouth (by the mylohyoid (mylohyoid nerve—V3), genioglossus, <b>styloglossus</b> and hyoglossus (the rest XII)) such that the tongue slopes downwards posteriorly. The contraction of the genioglossus and <b>styloglossus</b> (both XII) also contributes to the formation of the central trough.|$|E
50|$|Posterior to it, {{near its}} origin, is the {{superior}} laryngeal nerve; and higher up, it {{is separated from}} the internal carotid by the <b>Styloglossus</b> and Stylopharyngeus, the glossopharyngeal nerve, the pharyngeal branch of the vagus, {{and part of the}} parotid gland.|$|E

50|$|The {{tonsillar}} {{branch of}} the facial artery ascends between the pterygoideus internus and <b>styloglossus</b> muscles, and then {{along the side of}} the pharynx, perforating the constrictor pharyngis superior, to ramify in the substance of the palatine tonsil and root of the tongue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve provides motor {{control of the}} extrinsic muscles of the tongue: genioglossus, hyoglossus, <b>styloglossus,</b> and the intrinsic muscles of the tongue.

50|$|The {{ascending}} palatine artery arises {{close to}} {{the origin of the}} facial artery and passes up between the <b>styloglossus</b> and stylopharyngeus {{to the side of the}} pharynx along which it is continued between the superior pharyngeal constrictor and the medial pterygoid muscle to near the base of the skull.|$|E
50|$|They are {{situated}} on the under surface of {{the apex of the}} tongue, one {{on either side of the}} frenulum, where they are covered by a fascicle of muscular fibers derived from the <b>styloglossus</b> and inferior longitudinas muscles. They produce a glycoprotein, mucin that absorbs water to form a sticky secretion called mucus.|$|E
50|$|Posteromedial relations: The gland is {{situated}} anterolaterally to mastoid process of temporal bone with its attached sternocleidomastoid and digastric muscles, styloid process of temporal bone with its three attached muscles (stylohyoid, stylopharyngeus, and <b>styloglossus)</b> and carotid sheath with its contained neurovasculature (internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th cranial nerves).|$|E
50|$|The hyoglossus, {{thin and}} quadrilateral, {{arises from the}} side of the body and from the whole length of the greater cornu of the hyoid bone, and passes almost {{vertically}} upward to enter the side of the tongue, between the <b>styloglossus</b> and the inferior longitudinal muscle of the tongue. It forms a part of the floor of submandibular triangle.|$|E
5000|$|This vessel lies here {{in front}} of, and {{superficial}} to, the external carotid, being crossed by the facial nerve, and gives off in its course the posterior auricular, superficial temporal, and internal maxillary branches: more deeply are the internal carotid, the internal jugular vein, and the vagus nerve, separated from the external carotid by the <b>Styloglossus</b> and Stylopharyngeus, and the hypoglossal nerve ...|$|E
50|$|The nerve then passes {{between the}} medial pterygoid muscle and the ramus of the mandible, and crosses obliquely {{to the side}} of the tongue beneath the {{constrictor}} pharyngis superior and <b>styloglossus,</b> and then between the hyoglossus and deep part of the submandibular gland; it finally runs from laterally to medially inferiorly crossing the duct of the submandibular gland, and along the tongue to its tip becoming the sublingual nerve, lying immediately beneath the mucous membrane.|$|E
50|$|Anterior lingual glands (also called apical glands) {{are deeply}} placed seromucous glands that are {{located near the}} tip of the tongue {{on each side of the}} {{frenulum}} linguae. They are found on the under surface of the apex of the tongue, and are covered by a bundle of muscular fibers derived from the <b>Styloglossus</b> and Longitudinalis inferior. They are between 12 and 25 mm. in length, and approximately 8 mm. wide, and each opens by three or four ducts on the under surface of the tongue's apex.|$|E
50|$|The parotid fascia {{in human}} anatomy is a fascia that builds a closed {{membrane}} {{together with the}} masseteric fascia. This common membrane sheaths the parotid gland, its excretory duct and the passing out branches {{of the facial nerve}} as well. The parotid fascia proceeds of the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia that splits to cover the gland. At the lateral side of the gland this fascia is called the parotid fascia. The fascia itself is made of two layers: A superficial layer (lat. Lamina superficalis) that passes cranial into the temporal fascia and lateral into the masseteric fascia, and a deeper layer (lat. Lamina profunda) that covers the Stylohyoid muscle, the <b>styloglossus</b> and the Musculus stylopharyngeus. The superficial layer is attached to the zygomatic arch above and to the mandible below.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>styloglossus</b> muscle was histologically studied bilaterally in nine human fetuses (18 sides). In all cases, the muscle {{originated}} in Reichert’s cartilage, which {{gives rise to the}} temporal styloid process. We identified three types of variation: type A, an accessory muscle fascicle originating from the mandibular angle, found in 7 cases (12 sides); type B, where the <b>styloglossus</b> muscle was attached to the mandibular angle by fibrous tracts, found in three cases (4 sides); and type C, where an accessory muscle fascicle arose from the fibrous tract connecting Reichert’s cartilage to the mandibular angle; found in one case. In all cases (2 sides), the <b>styloglossus</b> muscle was innervated by the hypoglossal nerve.

30|$|Animal {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} that the genioglossus muscle is a key protrusion muscle, {{as opposed to the}} <b>styloglossus</b> and hyoglossus muscles which retract the tongue [13]. In 1989, Miki et al. found a relationship between the hypoglossal nerve and upper airway resistance during stimulation in six canines [14]. In 1992, Schwarz et al. reported a correlation of V 1 max stimulation and decrease in critical closing pressure (Pcrit) in 18 decerebrate felines. Yoo et al. suggested that multi-contact nerve electrodes can be effective in achieving upper airway dilation and patency by selective activation of various branches of the hypoglossal nerve in eight beagles [15]. Oliven et al. reported on the effect of airway modulation by selectively stimulating protrusor and retrusor muscles in anesthetized canines [16]. The study confirmed that selective genioglossus muscle stimulation significantly stabilized the airway while stimulation of the <b>styloglossus</b> and hyoglossus muscles collapsed the airway.|$|E
40|$|Background. Surgical {{approaches}} to the parapharyngeal spaces are challenging. Little {{is known about the}} transoral perspective of the anatomy of the parapharyngeal space. Thus, transoral approaches are seldom performed, and only for small-sized tumors. Methods. Six freshly injected cadaver heads were dissected to illustrate the transoral surgical anatomy of the parapharyngeal space. Results. The transoral window dominates the parapharyngeal space from the medial pterygoid muscle laterally to the superior constrictor muscle medially. The stylopharyngeus and <b>styloglossus</b> muscles seem to be critical landmarks in this approach. Posterior to these muscles and laterally to the superior constrictor muscle, the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and lower cranial nerves are identifiable. Conclusion. This anatomic study emphasizes the critical role of the superior constrictor, <b>styloglossus,</b> and stylopharyngeus muscles and highlights the concept of a logical step by step technique that allows the identification of important structures and the creation of safe surgical corridors...|$|E
40|$|The hyoid {{musculature}} and hyoid {{apparatus of}} bats {{of the family}} Megadermatidae are described and compared with the hyoid morphology of bat families described elsewhere. Megadermatids share an apomorphic character state with nycterids, rhinopomatids, and emballonurids in that the omohyoid muscle has shifted its origin from the scapula to the mid-clavicle. We suggest that be-cause of the omohyoid shift, megadermatids {{have been able to}} develop a morphological condition described previously only in New World phyllos-tomid bats. The sternohyoid, hyoglossus, and ge-niohyoid muscles have partially detached from the basihyal, retaining a connection only through a tendon and a few deep fibers of the geniohyoid. The <b>styloglossus</b> muscle has a posteriorly shifted insertion, as in phyllostomids. Within the Mega-dermatidae, there is morphological variation in the origin of the sternothyroid, hyoglossus, and sphincter colli profundus muscles, in the mor-phology of the <b>styloglossus,</b> and in the insertion ofthe geniohyoid and ceratohyoid muscles. A cla-distic analysis ofthe data suggests that Laviafrons is closely related to Megaderma spasma and M. lyra. Cardioderma cor is a sister species to the Lavia-Megaderma group. Macroderma gigas is the most distantly related of the four megadermatid genera...|$|E
40|$|Previously, {{we showed}} that {{artificial}} rearing using the 'pup in a cup ' model results in decreased tongue activity and caused some minor alterations in the tongue retrusor musculature. However, the artificial rearing time frame previously chosen was brief (11 days). The {{purpose of the present}} investigation was to extend the artificial rearing period from postnatal day 3 to 21 (P 21) to determine if significant alterations occur {{as a result of this}} reduced tongue use. 1) Several changes in contractile properties were observed due to the artificial rearing process, which fully recovered by postnatal day 41 to 42 (P 41 - 2). These changes included a shorter twitch contraction time, shorter twitch half-relaxation time, and decreased fatigue resistance. <b>Styloglossus</b> muscle exhibited more neonatal myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform at P 21 for the artificially reared (AR) group. 2) Changes that were persistent at P 41 - 2 were also observed. Maximum tetanic tension was lower for the AR group at P 21 and P 41 - 2 compared to their dam-reared counterparts. Twitch tension was also lower by P 41 - 2 in the AR group. At P 41 - 2, the AR group exhibited an increase in MHC IIa and a decrease in MHC IIb for the <b>styloglossus</b> muscle. In addition, the AR group exhibited a decreased MHC IIb for the long head of the biceps brachii at P 41 - 2. 3) Ou...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis article {{provides}} experimental evidence for two hypotheses, "the interdental-space effect" and the "stabilization effect", {{that may help}} to understand quantal acoustic properties of certain vowels. The interdental-space effect has its basis on the hypothesis [Stevens, K. N., & Perkell, J. S. (1977). Speech physiology and phonetic features. In M. S. Sawashima, & F. Cooper (Eds.), Dynamic aspect of speech production (pp. 323 - 341). Tokyo: University of Tokyo Press] that {{the gap between the}} upper and lower dental arches is involved in abrupt changes of oral cavity volume between low and high vowels. Our magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data indicate that this side cavity of the vocal tract is fused with the oral cavity in low vowels such as [a] but forms a bilateral side-branch in non-low vowels such as [i] and [e]. This abrupt change in the cavity's affiliation to the vocal tract contributes a discontinuity in otherwise smooth formant transitions. The stabilization effect [Fujimura, O., & Kakita, Y. (1979). Remarks on quantitative description of the lingual articulation. In B. Lindblom, & S. O¨hman (Eds.), Frontiers of Speech Communication Research (pp. 17 - 24). London: Academic Press] is the hypothesis that co-contraction among bundles of the genioglossus muscle stabilizes the formant pattern for [i], which was supported by analysis of electromyographic data. Our MRI-based measurement of tongue muscle geometry suggests an additional cause of vowel stabilization for [a]: posterior bulging of the tongue base for this vowel by the hyoglossus and <b>styloglossus</b> is mechanically limited by the parapharyngeal tissue that surrounds the extra-lingual <b>styloglossus...</b>|$|E
