5|$|Although Chadderton's {{industries}} declined {{during the}} mid-20th century, the town {{continued to grow}} {{as a result of}} suburbanisation and urban renewal. The legacy of the town's industrial past remains visible in its landscape of red-brick cotton mills, now used as warehouses or distribution centres. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> listed buildings because of their architectural, historical and cultural significance.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Airport is {{approximately}} 10miles (15km) away. The nearest major road is the A368, which {{runs along the}} southern edge of the lake and provides access from Bath and Weston super Mare. The A37 and A38 are slightly further away, providing access from Bristol. Car parking is available at the visitor centre and Woodford Lodge, for which a charge is made, and a small amount of parking is available at points around the lake; <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> restricted to those with fishing permits.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{near the}} arch resumed between 1994 and 1996, {{directed}} by Ronny Reich and Yaacov Billig. These have uncovered {{much of the}} debris from {{the collapse of the}} arch.

5|$|Migration southwards {{from the}} {{breeding}} range starts in October but {{the bulk of}} birds arrive in the United Kingdom in November. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> still on passage and carry on into continental Europe but others remain.

5|$|Nemerteans {{often have}} {{numerous}} temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), forming a row down {{each side of}} the body in the mesenchyme. Temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, are built when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, some lay them in a burrow or tube, and some protect them by cocoons or gelatinous strings. Some bathypelagic (deep sea) species have internal fertilization, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> viviparous, growing their embryos in the female's body.|$|E
5|$|Nesbitt found {{a number}} of further {{potential}} synapomorphies, and discounted {{a number of}} synapomorphies previously suggested. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> also present in silesaurids, which Nesbitt recovered as a sister group to Dinosauria, including a large anterior trochanter, metatarsals II and IV of subequal length, reduced contact between ischium and pubis, {{the presence of a}} cnemial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus, and many others.|$|E

5|$|With its mountainous {{terrain and}} ample rainfall, water {{is one of}} Wales' most {{abundant}} resources. The country has many man-made reservoirs and supplies water to England as well as generating power through hydroelectric schemes. The largest reservoirs, such as the Claerwen, are in the Elan Valley, and other notable bodies of water include Lake Vyrnwy, Talybont Reservoir and Llyn Brianne. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> popular resorts for outdoor activities such as sailing, kayaking, cycling, fishing and bird-watching.|$|E
5|$|A less violent side to Alexander's {{government}} {{is demonstrated by}} other evidence. Over a century after his time, his administrative decisions were still being cited as precedents. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> known from a surviving edict issued on July 6, 68, {{less than a month}} after Nero's death. This denounces, and introduces measures against, a variety of abuses including inaccurate tax assessments, malicious prosecutions and the imprisonment of debtors by private creditors. The edict's only allusion to the chaotic political situation comes as a call for trust in the benevolence of the new Emperor, Galba, and his ability to put right the wrongs of the past. Alexander was making representations to Galba on behalf of the provincials, presumably representing the desired reforms as the price of loyalty from this vital grain-producing province.|$|E
5|$|All {{that is left}} of Missouri Row is a four-sided {{concrete}} fireplace {{surrounded by}} pieces of foundation, a few sets of stairs, metal plumbing, and a retaining wall. East of that, surrounding {{what is now the}} Monte Ne boat launch, are remnants of limestone structures. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> foundations from the broad wooden staircase built in front of Hotel Monte Ne; some are structural components for the twin stone bridges that crossed the lagoon and some are simply low retaining walls. The amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the Pyramid are underwater. Occasionally, when water levels drop in summer, they can be seen.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the first}} major neo-noir films—the term often applied to films that {{consciously}} refer back to the classic noir tradition—was the French Tirez sur le pianiste (1960), directed by François Truffaut from a novel {{by one of the}} gloomiest of American noir fiction writers, David Goodis. Noir crime films and melodramas have been produced in many countries in the post-classic area. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> quintessentially self-aware neo-noirs—for example, Il Conformista (1969; Italy), Der Amerikanische Freund (1977; Germany), The Element of Crime (1984; Denmark), As Tears Go By (1988; Hong Kong), and El Aura (2005; Argentina). Others simply share narrative elements and a version of the hardboiled sensibility associated with classic noir, such as The Castle of Sand (1974; Japan), Insomnia (1997; Norway), Croupier (1998; UK), Blind Shaft (2003; China), and The Square (2008; Australia).|$|E
5|$|As {{ubiquitous}} insects, dipterans play {{an important}} role at various trophic levels both as consumers and as prey. In some groups the larvae complete their development without feeding, and in others the adults do not feed. The larvae can be herbivores, scavengers, decomposers, predators or parasites, with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviours. The fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated micro-organisms, a sieve-like filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles, while flesh-eating larvae have mouth-hooks to help shred their food. The larvae of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> serious pests of agricultural crops. Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants. Many of the parasitoid larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods, while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hosts.|$|E
5|$|Entrance to {{national}} park is available by boat in Wijdefjorden from the north, or over land from Billefjorden and Dicksonfjorden from the south. During winter, {{the area is}} accessible from Longyearbyen, either by snowmobile or by ski. There are several older trapper cabins in the park, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> lent to residents of Longyearbyen. Except for Einsteinvatnet, a lake with Arctic char, there are few destinations within the park, although the park {{can be used as}} a basis for other destinations. This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of the park, there is little good hiking within the park, except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord. It is possible to see the entire national park from Mittag-Lefflerbreen, which can be hiked to from Pyramiden.|$|E
