Hewenden, Bents and Beckfoot mills have all since {{been converted into}} private accommodation buildings. Hallas Bridge Mill was destroyed by fire. Goit <b>Stock</b> <b>Mill</b> was later utilised as a café and ballroom. It too burnt down (in 1927) with no reports of casualties. Its chimney and flue are still extant, with the chimney being built on the northern ridge to aid the dispersal of smoke from the narrow valley. Harden Bridge Mill is still in private use as a printers.|$|E
50|$|Stock Windmill {{was built}} circa 1816 joining an {{existing}} post mill. In 1845, a second post mill {{was moved to}} a site close by. By 1862, the mill had four shuttered sails. The two post mills were demolished c.1890, about which time the millstones were moved down a floor and the drive converted from underdrift to overdrift. A steam engine was added in 1902 and the mill was working by wind until 1930 and afterwards by an internal combustion engine until c.1936. The mill was bought by Essex County Council in 1945 and although preserved, by 1977 it was without the fantail and associated supporting timbers, and down to only one pair of sails. Major repairs were started in 1991 by Vincent Pargeter. A grant from English Heritage part-funded the work. The Friends of <b>Stock</b> <b>Mill</b> were formed in 1993 on completion of the restoration.|$|E

50|$|Probably {{built around}} 1781, {{it was named}} <b>Stocks</b> <b>Mill</b> after the village stocks that stood nearby. The mill may be older {{and may have been}} moved from Stone in Oxney, with the date 1781 carved into the main post {{denoting}} its re-erection. The Mill House was at one time used as the parish Poorhouse. The mill was last worked circa 1900, and was then preserved by Norman Forbes-Robertson, who owned the mill and Mill House. The mill passed into the ownership of the artist Randolph H Sauter. and then Sir Edward Parry. The mill was repaired in 1958, and in 1968 a new stock and pair of sails was fitted by the millwright Derek Ogden. In 1980, the mill was acquired by Kent County Council and the Friends of <b>Stocks</b> <b>Mill</b> was set up to allow the mill to be opened to the public. The mill underwent a restoration programme starting in 2002 and partly funded by the National Lottery, which included two new sails amongst other work. Some of the milling machinery which had been removed over the years was recreated. The mill was reopened to the public in 2004.|$|R

50|$|Great clipper {{ships of}} the 19th century, however, {{bypassed}} Ipswich {{in favor of}} the deep-water seaports at Salem, Newburyport, Quincy, and Boston. The town remained primarily a fishing and farming community, its residents living in older homes they could not afford to replace—leaving Ipswich with a considerable inventory of early architecture. In 1822, a stocking manufacturing machine which had been smuggled out of England arrived at Ipswich, violating a British ban on exporting such technology, and the community developed as a mill town. In 1828, the Ipswich Female Seminary was founded. In 1868, Amos A. Lawrence established the Ipswich Hosiery Mills beside the river. It would expand into the largest <b>stocking</b> <b>mill</b> in the country {{by the turn of the}} 20th century. What may be the last witchcraft trial in North America was held in Ipswich in 1878. In the Ipswich witchcraft trial, a member of the Christian Science religion was accused of using his mental powers to harm others, including a spinster living in the town.|$|R
5000|$|Balbriggan {{was also}} the {{location}} of the 19th century Smith's <b>Stocking</b> <b>Mill,</b> which made stockings as well as men's [...] "Long-Johns" [...] called Balbriggans. These are often mentioned in John Wayne films - 'he put his balbriggans on' - and both Queen Victoria and the Czarina of Russia also wore [...] "Balbriggans". Wavin has been manufacturing plastic pipes, contributing to the provision of running water in many Irish rural homes, in their purpose-built facility since 1962.Balbriggan's strong textile connections also include the linen & cotton manufacturing of Charles Gallen & Company, who in 1870, purchased the existing weaving mill and associated facilities built by Baron Hamilton. The firm became famous as the finest linen weavers in Ireland and had custom all over the world. They were also suppliers of linens to the Vatican, Embassies of Ireland and the US, and fine hotels worldwide. The business continues today from another location as the old mill in the town centre has been redeveloped.|$|R

40|$|At present, mills {{producing}} {{structural timber}} generally undertake strength grading {{at the end}} of the production process, i. e., after buying the material and sawing it into timber which is then dried. This means that any variation in wood stiffness between forest stands and between trees is unknown and unaccounted for until the end of the manufacturing process. Portable stress-wave-based tools provide a cost effective means for predicting the stiffness of the resource, either in standing tree or in log form. Better knowledge of the properties of the available forest resource will allow manufacturers to optimise production capability. By knowing the average properties of their raw material <b>stocks</b> <b>mills</b> will be better able to predict the grade outturn of structural products. They will also be able to segregate out low stiffness stands or logs and use this material to create non-structural products, such as fencing, pallets, etc. Finally, knowledge about the average stiffness of individual logs, could potentially allow a mill to change the cutting pattern in order to maximise the value of each log. In this paper, the application of stress-wave-based tools to the Sitka spruce supply chain in the UK is discussed along with the implications of raw material segregation on timber mechanical properties...|$|R
50|$|The four patent sails are now {{carried by}} {{traditional}} wooden <b>stocks.</b> When the <b>mill</b> was restored in the 1950s, the Dutch millwright Christiaan Bremer of Adorp, Gronungen was employed, {{and he made}} the stocks in the Dutch style. Although these <b>stocks</b> served the <b>mill</b> for over forty years, they did not represent Kentish practice and were not {{in accordance with the}} Code of Practice of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings covering mill restoration and repair. The stocks pass through the canister on the cast-iron windshaft, and this carries the brake wheel. The brake wheel drives the wallower, {{at the top of the}} upright shaft, and a sack hoist. At the bottom of the upright shaft is the great spur wheel, which drove three pairs of millstones, of which two remain. These are driven overdrift. A crown wheel drove auxiliary machinery.|$|R
5000|$|Messing Maypole Mill {{was built}} in 1775 by Colchester {{millwright}} John Mathett {{at a cost of}} £315 excluding the brickwork. Matchett also rebuilt a post mill which stood some 190 yd south west of the tower mill (TL 894 167) and sum of £315 may include that work. Matchett owned the mill until it was purchased by miller Thomas Green in 1797. The mill passed to Edward Harvey on Green’s death in 1806. Harvey died in 1829 and in 1829 the mill was purchased by miller James Peake. Peake was declared bankrupt in 1845 and the mill sold by his assignees. George Ransom was the next miller, and he introduced steam power. After the death of Ransom in 1884 the mill was run by his widow for a few years and then by Henry Cattermole. In 1890, the Colchester millwright Bryant replaced the old wooden windshaft with the cast iron windshaft from the annular sailed mill at Roxwell. Bryant may have added the fantail at this time. [...] Milling by wind ceased c1911. During World War I the mill was worked by steam alone. Frederick King put the mill back to full working order in the 1920s, but the sails were finally removed in February 1927, leaving just the <b>stocks.</b> <b>Milling</b> continued until at least 1962, although the millstones were removed in 1960. Power latterly was by electricity. The mill was converted into a residence in 1969.|$|R

40|$|Few {{empirical}} basis {{studies have}} examined the basis in multiple regions and few have concentrated on cotton. This paper addresses this topic, examining consumption market factors that affect the cotton basis in five U. S. cotton production regions. The seemingly unrelated regression results indicate that the following factors are significant in explaining the basis: total U. S. cotton stocks and the ratio of foreign cotton <b>stocks</b> to foreign <b>mill</b> use in the Southeast and North Delta regions; regional stocks, the opportunity cost of storage and the foreign stocks to use ratio in the West Texas region; and regional stocks, total U. S. stocks, the opportunity cost of storage, and the foreign stocks to use ratio in the Desert Southwest and San Joaquin Valley regions. All significant coefficients have the hypothesized signs except the coefficient for the opportunity cost of storage and the coefficient for the ratio of foreign <b>stocks</b> to foreign <b>mill</b> use in two regions. The results indicate that the cotton basis in different regions is typically affected by different factors. cotton basis, futures markets, Marketing,...|$|R

50|$|At KI Finsshriber {{continued}} his social activism, inviting such notables as Margaret Sanger, {{the founder of}} the modern birth control movement, to speak at KI and making the Noble prize winning physicist, Albert Einstein, an honorary member of the Congregation. Einstein spoke at KI’s 90th anniversary celebration. Fineshriber was also nationally active in the movie industry, working with Hollywood leaders to adopt a “decency code” for the film industry. He also was involved in the labor arbitration, in Philadelphia and elsewhere. In settling the Aberle <b>Stocking</b> <b>Mill</b> strike he worked with Jewish leaders of the textile workers union and the Jewish managers and owners of the textile companies. In this sense, Fineshriber acted in the tradition of Rabbis settling disputes within their own community. Fineshriber’s work led to a nationally accepted arbitration procedure for most of the textile industry. More complicated was Fineshriber’s response to the Zionism and the rise of Nazism. Reflecting the mainstream position of the Reform movement, Fineshriber supported the emigration of Eastern European Jews to what was then British controlled Palestine, but he did not support the creation of a Jewish state or believe that American Jews should emigrate there. He consistently argued that Jews were members of a religion, not a nationality, and thus KI accepted the formal position of the Reform Movement (as expressed through the Union of American Hebrew Congregations) to “disassociate itself completely from any controversy pertaining to political Zionism.” Like all Jews, in the 1930s he was shocked and appalled by the rise of Nazism with its grotesque persecution of Jews, and some members of KI were actively associated holocaust rescue, especially Gil and Eleanor Kraus who rescued at least fifty German-Jewish children before World War II began.|$|R
50|$|In 1851, David Levy Yulee {{established}} a 5000 acre sugar plantation on the Homosassa River, {{close to the}} current town of Homosassa. The plantation was worked by approximately 1,000 slaves, but Yulee was an absentee owner, spending {{most of his time}} in Fernandina. Among the crops raised were sugar cane, cotton and citrus. The Yulee Groves were one of the first in Florida to grow sweet oranges budded from sour orange <b>stock.</b> The <b>mill,</b> which was steam-driven, operated from 1851 to 1864 and produced sugar, syrup and molasses, the last of which was part of the rum-making process.

The remains of the plantation are preserved at the Yulee Sugar Mill Ruins Historic State Park.|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{critical}} regionalism {{and sustainable}} design through the adaptive reuse {{of the former}} Interwoven <b>Stocking</b> Company <b>mill</b> in Martinsburg, West Virginia. New programming establishes the manufacturing complex as the Interwoven School of Crafts, a learning institution dedicated {{to the production of}} functional, handcrafted arts and thereby also to the continuance of local culture. Regionalistic ideas are further explored through the development of a visitor center and gallery building that showcases the work of the artists. Nestled within the historic complex, this contemporary building is the interface between spaces, materials, and time periods. By building a contemporary structure the character of the existing buildings is enhanced by the contrast rather than trivialized by imitation or replication. By designing with sustainable principles and building craft in mind the newer components will contribute to both the character and the long lifespan of what is already on site...|$|R
