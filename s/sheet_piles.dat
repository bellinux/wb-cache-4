2500|$|On April 5, 2006, {{months after}} {{independent}} investigators had {{demonstrated that the}} levee failures were not due to natural forces beyond intended design strength, Lt. Gen. Carl Strock testified before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that, [...] "We have now concluded we had problems with {{the design of the}} structure." [...] He also testified that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not know of this mechanism of failure prior to August 29, 2005. The claim of ignorance is refuted by the National Science Foundation investigators hired by the Army Corps of Engineers, who point to a 1986 study (E-99 study) by the corps itself that such separations were possible in the I-wall design. This issue is addressed again in a study released in August 2015 by J. David Rogers et al. who concluded that a misinterpretation of the 1986 study occurred apparently because the Corps had draped a tarpaulin over the gap that formed between the bases of the deflecting <b>sheet</b> <b>piles</b> and the soil in which they were embedded, so they did not see the gap. The tarpaulin was there for safety and to stop water that would seep through the interlocks. Failure to include the gap in interpretation of the test results introduced unconservatism in the final designs based on these tests. It allowed the use of shorter <b>sheet</b> <b>piles,</b> and reduced overall flood protection reliability.|$|E

2500|$|Flooding due to {{rain and}} storms {{has long been}} an issue since the New Orleans' early {{settlement}} due to the city's location on a delta marsh, much of which sits below sea level. The city is surrounded by the Mississippi River to the south, Lake Pontchartrain to the north, and Lake Borgne to the east. Construction of the levees along the River began soon after the city was founded, and more extensive river levees were built as the city grew. The levees were originally designed to prevent damage caused by seasonal flooding. Today, the floodwalls atop the 17th Street and London Avenue Canals are used for drainage, to pump water from the city streets out to Lake Pontchartrain. These floodwalls are one foot (300mm) wide at the top and widened to two feet (600mm) at the base. The visible portion is a concrete cap on steel sheet pile that anchors to the wall. [...] <b>Sheet</b> <b>piles</b> are interlocked steel columns, in this case at least 30 feet (10 m) long, with 6 to 10 feet (2 to 3 m) visible above ground; examinations afterward showed that some pilings were not as deep as specified.

2500|$|Rock-fill dams are {{embankments}} of compacted free-draining granular {{earth with}} an impervious zone. The earth utilized often contains {{a high percentage}} of large particles, hence the term [...] "rock-fill". The impervious zone may be on the upstream face and made of masonry, concrete, plastic membrane, steel <b>sheet</b> <b>piles,</b> timber or other material. The impervious zone may also be within the embankment in which case it is referred to as a core. In the instances where clay is utilized as the impervious material the dam is referred to as a composite dam. To prevent internal erosion of clay into the rock fill due to seepage forces, the core is separated using a filter. Filters are specifically graded soil designed to prevent the migration of fine grain soil particles. When suitable material is at hand, transportation is minimized leading to cost savings during construction. Rock-fill dams are resistant to damage from earthquakes. However, inadequate quality control during construction can lead to poor compaction and sand in the embankment which can lead to liquefaction of the rock-fill during an earthquake. Liquefaction potential can be reduced by keeping susceptible material from being saturated, and by providing adequate compaction during construction. An example of a rock-fill dam is New Melones Dam in California or the Fierza Dam in Albania.|$|E

40|$|For {{over three}} {{quarters}} of a century steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are applied in geotechnical practice. For example in quay walls and construction pits in urban surroundings. Steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are often composed of so called double U-profiles. These profiles consist of two single U profiles fixed in the common interlock by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double U-profile is an asymmetric cross-section which can lead to a rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of this, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall tends to deflect both forward (lateral) and sideways (transverse). This phenomenon is called oblique bending. As a result of oblique bending, the strength and lateral stiffness of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall may be decreased considerably up to values of 60 % to 70 % compared to a continuous <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall. This leads to uneconomical designs. Four different methods to reduce oblique bending in a steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall have been studied: 1) Cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall in dry sand. 2) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a fix of the horizontal displacement at the top. 3) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a capping beam on top. 4) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> with the sliding interlock welded during the excavation. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine which method is able to give the highest resistance against oblique bending. Therefore calculations have been made with a 3 D-finite element model (DIANA) of a dry excavation of a sand body in front of a cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall consisting of double U-profiles. The lower limit of the strength and stiffness is obtained when no transverse bending moment is activated and the in plane deformation is free. The maximum or upper limit strength and stiffness is derived if oblique bending is prevented by fixing the free interlocks (no in plane deformation). Depending on the loading conditions, the stiffness varies from 0. 49 to 1 time the maximum stiffness. The strength appeared to vary from 0. 59 to 1 time the maximum strength. 3 D-finite element calculations have been made for the mentioned four methods to reduce oblique bending. From the 3 D calculations it followed that the use of these methods may increase the strength and stiffness up to about 0. 8 times the maximum value for strength and stiffness. Welding of the interlock during excavation gave the highest reduction of oblique bending. Foundation Engineering GroupHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|During {{vibratory}} <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> {{quite often}} the soil near the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall will settle. In many cases {{this is not}} a problem. For situations with houses, pipelines, roads or railroads at relative short distance these settlements may not be acceptable. The purpose of the research described in this thesis is to develop a model that is capable of predicting the settlement due to vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> with reasonable accuracy. The research is limited to <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> in sand. First a description is given of the processes during vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>piling.</b> From this description the main mechanisms that are responsible for the settlement during vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> are identified. These are the densification of the soil and the displacement of a soil volume due to the volume of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Presently available models to predict the settlement are described and commented. It is concluded that all models possess some shortcomings. As densification {{is one of the main}} causes for the settlement much attention is paid to the behaviour of sand during cyclic loading. Available models to predict the densification for large numbers of loading cycles are described. Attention is paid to the combined effect of generation and dissipation of excess pore pressure. To supplement the findings from the literature a series of cyclic triaxial tests is performed to clarify some aspects. These tests show that the history of the sand greatly influences the behaviour during cyclic loading. A numerical model is developed that takes into account the different sub processes during vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> (interface behaviour <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> - soil, propagation of vibrations, densification, dissipation excess pore pressure and summation of the local volume strains). For the propagation and the densification different options are considered and implemented. The selected constitutive models are extended to handle both undrained and drained soil behaviour. To validate the developed model a well instrumented field test is designed and executed. This test is performed at Raamsdonksveer, The Netherlands. Measured data are the vibrations near the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile,</b> the pore pressure, the local densification, the settlement at surface and at two depths and the change in cone resistance. The measured data are processed and interpreted. In addition to the results of this test, measured surface settlements from a number of projects are used as well to compare predictions with the developed model with actual behaviour. A reasonable agreement between measured and predicted settlement is found. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

The effect of excavation and backfilling process on the behavior of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall have been thoroughly investigated and the results are presented in terms of the wall deformations and bending moments, developed anchor forces, and the earth pressures developed on both active and passive side of the wall. Development of failure mechanism in terms of soil displacements and incremental deviatoric strains, slip lines and plastic points formations have been illustrated.
