25|$|The Mojave Desert {{appears to}} have {{little in the way}} of {{wildlife}} but actually has large, diverse populations. The extremely warm desert environment has animals that have adapted to their environment with each filling an important niche in the desert ecosystem. Animals in the Mojave Desert include the Mohave rattlesnake, desert tortoise, glossy snake, common side-blotched lizard, California kingsnake, giant hairy <b>scorpion,</b> <b>stripe</b> tailed <b>scorpion</b> and the desert iguana.|$|R
50|$|The {{region is}} home to a large number of reptiles. Some of the {{prevalent}} wildlife in the southern area are coyote, <b>striped</b> bark <b>scorpions,</b> rattlesnakes, and common house geckos.|$|R
50|$|The <b>striped</b> bark <b>scorpion</b> (Centruroides vittatus) is an {{extremely}} common scorpion found throughout the midsection of the United States and northern Mexico. It {{is perhaps the most}} frequently encountered scorpion in the U.S.|$|R
50|$|Although {{at first}} glance the Mojave Desert seems to have {{little in the way}} of wildlife, it {{actually}} contains large, diverse populations. The extremely warm desert environment may seem an unlikely place for animals to thrive or even exist. However, desert animals have adapted to their environment, and each fills an important niche in the desert ecosystem. Known animals in the Mojave Desert include the Mohave rattlesnake, desert tortoise, glossy snake, common side-blotched lizard, California kingsnake, giant hairy <b>scorpion,</b> <b>stripe</b> tailed <b>scorpion</b> and the desert iguana.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{signaling}} promotes mate location throughout numerous animal taxa. In {{this study}} we investigated the possibility that <b>striped</b> <b>scorpions,</b> Centruroides vittatus, use chemical signaling {{in the form of}} odor plumes or substrate-borne deposits as communication channels. A Y-shaped arena was constructed to test scorpions’ use of air-borne chemical cues in the detection of potential mates. A second, circular behavioral choice chamber was used to test male scorpions’ responses to female deposits by direct substrate contact. Male scorpions showed no tendency to move toward the female in tests of air-borne chemical transmission but they did demonstrate behavior associatedwith chemical detection when exposed to substrate-borne feminine deposits. Our experiments do not provide evidence that male C. vittatus use aerial pheromones to locate female scorpions but that they are highly sensitive to direct contact of substrate-borne chemical deposits...|$|R
50|$|The {{scorpions}} of Nevada {{are well}} represented by four main families: Buthidae, Caraboctonidae, Vaejovidae and the intriguingly named Superstitioniidae. Nevada has 23 species of scorpion, including the extremely common <b>striped</b> bark <b>scorpion.</b> Other species of scorpion include the giant desert hairy scorpion, Baja California bark scorpion and Hadrurus spadix. Nevada's hot climate {{makes it an}} ideal state for certain spiders to live. Spiders include Carolina wolf spider, jumping spider, funnel-weaving spider, crab spider, black widow and tarantula.|$|R
50|$|A {{medium-sized}} scorpion that {{is rarely}} longer than 70 mm (up to around 2 3/4 inches), the <b>striped</b> bark <b>scorpion</b> is a uniform pale-yellow scorpion {{that can be}} identified by two dark, longitudinal stripes on its carapace, with a dark triangular above the ocular tubercle. There are minor variations on this theme, however; specimens that are lighter-colored and lack the characteristic stripes {{have been described as}} separate species in the past. Their color suits their environment well, providing them with a natural camouflage from predators as well as prey. Males have a pectinal tooth count of 21-30, while females count 20-27.|$|R
50|$|While {{the genus}} Centruroides implies this species is a semi-arboreal one, the <b>striped</b> bark <b>scorpion</b> spends a {{substantial}} amount of its time on the ground and can be found in under rock and surface debris, within vegetation, and in weathered rural structures like old sheds and barns during the day. The terrestrial preferences of this species carry into the night hours, when the scorpion will emerge from its temporal shelter at or after sunset to search forage for potential prey. Juveniles, however, spend {{a substantial amount}} of time in vegetation likely to avoid predation to which they are more vulnerable. C. vittatus has a very dynamic diet which includes insects, smaller arachnids and juveniles of the same species. It is preyed on by birds, reptiles, some mammals and larger arachnids.|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{can result}} from sexual or ecological selective pressures, but the importance of alternative reproductive roles and trait compensation in generating phenotypic differences between the sexes is poorly understood. We evaluated morphological and behavioral sexual dimorphism in <b>striped</b> bark <b>scorpions</b> (Centruroides vittatus). We propose that reproductive roles have driven sexually dimorphic body mass in this species which produces sex differences in locomotor performance. Poor locomotor performance in the females (due to the burden of being gravid) favors compensatory aggression {{as part of an}} alternative defensive strategy, while male morphology is coadapted to support a sprinting-based defensive strategy. We tested the effects of sex and morphology on stinging and sprinting performance and characterized overall differences between the sexes in aggressiveness towards simulated threats. Greater body mass was associated with higher sting rates and slower sprinting within sexes, which explained the greater aggression of females (the heavier sex) and, along with longer legs in males, the improved sprint performance in males. These findings suggest females are aggressive to compensate for locomotor costs of reproduction while males possess longer legs to enhance sprinting for predator evasion and mate finding. Sexual dimorphism in the metasoma ("tail") was unrelated to stinging and sprinting performance and may best be explained by sexual selection...|$|R
