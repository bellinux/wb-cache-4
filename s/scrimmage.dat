5|$|Camp's new <b>scrimmage</b> rules {{revolutionized}} the game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used <b>scrimmage</b> play {{to slow the}} game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined {{with the establishment of}} the line of <b>scrimmage,</b> transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.|$|E
5|$|The line {{judge is}} {{positioned}} {{on the end}} of the line of <b>scrimmage,</b> opposite the head linesman. He or she supervises player substitutions, the line of <b>scrimmage</b> during punts, and game timing. He notifies the referee when time has expired at the end of a quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.|$|E
5|$|The team's first intra-squad <b>scrimmage</b> showcased Pitino's fast-paced, three-point-heavy style; the {{two teams}} {{combined}} to shoot 98-of-175 from the field, including 23-of-57 from three, as the Blue team defeated the White team 14585. Farmer led the White team (the projected reserves) in scoring with 26 points, including 5-of-13 shooting from three-point range. In the next <b>scrimmage,</b> played at Farmer's alma mater, Clay County High School, Farmer scored 32 points, but the White team lost to the Blue team again, 125117. The teams again combined for 175 shots, and Pitino said before the game that he wanted both teams to exceed 120 points. Farmer sat out much {{of the second half}} of the final <b>scrimmage</b> due to illness but scored 17 points on 5-of-16 shooting in a 124120 victory for the White team.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a single}} or rouge, play resumes with the non-scoring team <b>scrimmaging</b> {{from its own}} 35-yard line, unless the single is awarded on a missed field goal, {{in which case the}} non-scoring team <b>scrimmages</b> from either the 35-yard line or the yard line from which the field goal was attempted, {{whichever}} is greater.|$|R
5|$|The {{three types}} of <b>scrimmage</b> kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points. The place kick is the {{standard}} method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football {{makes it difficult to}} reliably drop kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a <b>scrimmage</b> kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of <b>scrimmage.</b> If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver, but the play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{categories}} of kicks in football: <b>scrimmage</b> kicks, which can be executed by the offensive team on any down from behind or on the line of <b>scrimmage,</b> and free kicks. The free kicks are the kickoff, which starts {{the first and third}} quarters and overtime and follows a try attempt or a successful field goal, and the safety kick, which follows a safety.|$|E
5|$|A strong game by Doug Williams {{carried the}} Buccaneers despite an anemic rushing attack. Both teams later complained about officiating errors and the {{malfunctioning}} game clock. The Metropolitan Stadium 30-second clock failed {{for the second}} week in a row, as did both regulation clocks. The Buccaneers survived a last-minute drive by the Vikings in which quarterback Tommy Kramer was penalized for throwing a pass from beyond the line of <b>scrimmage,</b> which helped to keep the Vikings out of field goal range. Curtis Jordan sealed the victory by deflecting Kramer's last-second Hail Mary pass. Kramer later admitted to being aware of having crossed the line of <b>scrimmage,</b> but had hoped that the officials would miss it as they had missed so many other penalties in the game.|$|E
