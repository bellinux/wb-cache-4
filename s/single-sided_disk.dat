2500|$|An Easter egg {{is present}} on the Apple II floppy disk release. Though claimed to be sold as a <b>single-sided</b> <b>disk,</b> the reverse side of the disk {{included}} a full version of the game that would be rendered upside-down on the player's monitor. According to Mechner, this was done as a joke, causing naive users to call tech support and ask why the game was upside-down. Invariably, those users would receive the reply, [...] "take the disk out, insert it right-side up, and reboot".|$|E
50|$|Atari {{initially}} used <b>single-sided</b> <b>disk</b> drives {{that could}} store up to 360 kB. Later drives were double-sided and stored 720 kB. Some commercial software, particularly games, shipped by default on single-sided disks, even supplying two 360kB floppies {{instead of a}} single double-sided one, for fear of alienating early adopters.|$|E
50|$|Early floppy disks {{only used}} one surface for recording. The term <b>single-sided</b> <b>disk</b> was not common until the {{introduction}} of the double-sided disk, which offered double the capacity in the same physical size. Initially, double-sided disks had to be removed and flipped over to access data on the other side, but eventually devices were made that could read both sides without the need to eject the disk.|$|E
5000|$|The CP/M BIOS of the Executive could {{automatically}} {{detect and}} use <b>single-sided</b> <b>disks</b> formatted {{in the following}} systems: ...|$|R
5000|$|Manufacturers sold both <b>single-sided</b> and {{double-sided}} <b>disks</b> {{with the}} double-sided disks being typically 50% {{more expensive than}} <b>single-sided</b> <b>disks.</b> While the magnetic-coated medium was coated on both sides, the single-sided floppies had a read-write notch on only one side, thus allowing only {{one side of the}} disk to be used. When users discovered this, they began buying the less-expensive <b>single-sided</b> <b>disks</b> and [...] "notching" [...] them using scissors, a hole punch, or a specially-designed [...] "notcher" [...] to allow them to write to the reverse side of the disk.|$|R
5000|$|ADFS {{supported}} hard discs, and 3½" [...] floppy discs formatted up to 640 KB capacity using {{double density}} MFM encoding (L format; <b>single-sided</b> <b>disks</b> were supported with the S format (160 KB) and M format (320 KB)). ADFS as {{implemented in the}} BBC microcomputer system (and later RISC OS) never had support for single-density floppies.|$|R
50|$|Floppy disks were {{supported}} on IBM's PC DOS and Microsoft's MS-DOS from their beginning {{on the original}} IBM PC. With version 1.0 of PC DOS (1981), only single-sided 160 KB floppies {{were supported}}. Version 1.1 the next year saw support expand to double-sided 320 KB disks. Finally, in 1983, DOS 2.0 supported 9 sectors per track rather than 8, providing 180 KB on a (formatted) <b>single-sided</b> <b>disk</b> and 360 KB on a double-sided.|$|E
50|$|Its {{principal}} deficiencies were a tiny 5 in {{display screen}} {{and use of}} single sided, single density floppy disk drives which could not contain sufficient data for practical business applications, and considerable unit weight. Adam Osborne decided to use <b>single-sided</b> <b>disk</b> drives out of concern about double-sided drives suffering head damage from rough handling. A single-density disk controller was used to keep costs down. As a result, the Osborne's floppy disks held a mere 90k.|$|E

50|$|<b>Single-sided</b> <b>disks</b> {{began to}} become {{obsolete}} after {{the introduction of}} IBM PC DOS 1.1 in 1982, which added support for double-side diskette drives with capacity of 320 KB to the IBM 5150 PC. In 1983 PC DOS 2.0 pushed the formatting capacity to 180 KB single-sided or 360 KB double-sided by utilizing 9 instead of only 8 sectors per track.|$|R
25|$|Single sided disks were {{coated on}} both sides, despite the {{availability}} of more expensive double sided disks. The reason usually given for the higher cost was that double sided disks were certified error-free {{on both sides of}} the media. Double-sided disks could be used in some drives for <b>single-sided</b> <b>disks,</b> as long as an index signal was not needed. This was done one side at a time, by turning them over (flippy disks); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.|$|R
5000|$|The Apple Disk II stored 140 kB on single-sided, [...] "single-density" [...] floppy disks, but it {{was very}} common for Apple II users to extend the {{capacity}} of a <b>single-sided</b> floppy <b>disk</b> to 280 kB by cutting out a second write-protect notch {{on the side of the}} disk using a [...] "disk notcher" [...] or hole puncher and inserting the disk flipped over. Double-sided disks, with notches on both sides, were available at a higher price, but in practice the magnetic coating on the reverse of nominally <b>single-sided</b> <b>disks</b> was usually of good enough quality to be used (both sides were coated in the same way to prevent warping, although only one side was certified for use). Early on, diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read/write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster, and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day. In practice, however, this method was an inexpensive way to store twice as much data for no extra cost, and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} table {{illustrates the}} layout of Commodore 1541 BAM. The table would be larger for higher-capacity disks (described below).The bitmap was contained in 3 bytes for Commodore 1541 format (<b>single-sided)</b> <b>disks</b> because it had 17 to 20 sectors per track (note 3 bytes can hold at least 20 bits). [...] Similarly, the Commodore 1571 used 3 bytes for the bitmap of each track, but the BAM was twice the size because there were twice as many tracks when formatted as double-sided. [...] In contrast, the Commodore 1581 disk drive used 5 bytes for the bitmap because the disk format had 40 blocks per track (note 5 bytes can hold 40 bits).|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} formats existed for Atari disks. Atari DOS 2.0S, <b>single-sided,</b> single-density <b>disk</b> had 720 sectors divided into 40 tracks. After formatting, 707 sectors were free. Each 128 byte sector used the last 3 bytes for housekeeping data (bytes used, file number, next sector), leaving 125 bytes for data.|$|R
50|$|The MacVenture {{engine was}} written in 1985 for the first game in the series, Déjà Vu. Making the entire game fit {{together}} with system software on two 400 k <b>single-sided</b> floppy <b>disks</b> proved {{to be quite a}} challenge and special image compression routines had to be written to accomplish this.|$|R
5000|$|Three-inch diskettes bear much {{similarity}} to the 3½-inch size, {{but with some}} unique features. One example is the more elongated plastic casing, taller than a 3½-inch disk, but less wide and thicker (i.e. with increased depth). The actual 3-inch magnetic-coated disk occupies less than 50% of the space inside the casing, the rest {{being used by the}} complex protection and sealing mechanisms implemented on the disks, which thus are largely responsible for the thickness, length, and relatively high costs of the disks. On the early Amstrad machines (the CPC line and the PCW 8256), the disks are typically flipped over to change the side (acting like 2 separate <b>single-sided</b> <b>disks,</b> comparable to the [...] "flippy disks" [...] of 5¼-inch media) as opposed to being contiguously double-sided. Double-sided mechanisms were introduced on the later PCW 8512 and PCW 9512, thus removing the need to remove, flip, and then reinsert the disk.|$|R
50|$|The {{term was}} first used by Apple Computer in 1988 to refer to their 1.40 MB 3.5 inch floppy drive. This {{replaced}} the older 800 KB floppy drive that had been standard in the Macintosh up to then, but remained compatible in that it could continue {{to read and write}} both 800 KB (double-sided) and 400 KB (<b>single-sided)</b> floppy <b>disks,</b> as well as the then-new high-density floppies.|$|R
50|$|Like the 5¼-inch, the 3½-inch disk {{underwent}} {{an evolution}} of its own. When Apple introduced the Macintosh in 1984, it used <b>single-sided</b> 3½-inch <b>disk</b> drives with an advertised capacity of 400 kB. The encoding technique used by these drives {{was known as}} GCR, or Group Coded Recording (similar recording methods were used by Commodore on its 5¼-inch drives and Sirius Systems Technology in its Victor 9000 non-PC-compatible MS-DOS machine). Somewhat later, PC-compatible machines began using <b>single-sided</b> 3½-inch <b>disks</b> with an advertised capacity of 360 kB (the same as a double-sided 5¼-inch disk), and a different, incompatible recording format called MFM (Modified Frequency Modulation). GCR and MFM drives (and their formatted disks) were incompatible, although the physical disks were the same. In 1986, Apple introduced double-sided, 800 kB disks, still using GCR, and soon after, IBM began using 720 kB double-sided double-density MFM disks in PCs like the IBM PC Convertible. IBM PC compatibles adopted it too, whilst the Amiga used MFM encoding on the same disks to give a capacity of 1 MB (880 KB available once formatted).|$|R
50|$|Like the cosmetically similar Rainbow 100 and DECmate II (also {{introduced}} at that time),the PRO series used the LK201 keyboard and 400kB <b>single-sided</b> quad-density floppy <b>disk</b> drives (known as RX50), {{and offered a}} choice of color or monochrome monitors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{disk drives}} offered on the Model I were Shugart SA-400s which {{supported}} 35 tracks, however the Model 3/4/4P used Tandon TM-100 40-track drives. The combination of 40 tracks and double-density gave a maximum capacity of 180 kilobytes per <b>single-sided</b> floppy <b>disk.</b> The use of index-sync meant that a [...] "flippy disk" [...] required a second index hole and write-enable notch. One could purchase factory-made [...] "flippies". Some software publishers formatted one side for Apple {{systems and the}} other for the TRS-80.|$|R
50|$|Early {{systems could}} be fitted with an {{optional}} single density {{floppy disk controller}} card that could interfaced to either internal 5¼-inch or external 8-inch floppy disk drives. Disk capacity was 80 KB per side on 5¼-inch disks and 250.25 KB per side on 8-inch disks. Double-sided disk drives were treated as two independent disks with a drive letter per side. CP/M used the first 4 tracks on 5¼-inch disks and the first 3 tracks on 8-inch disks, reducing the usable capacity of a single density, <b>single-sided</b> 5¼-inch <b>disk</b> to 72 KB.|$|R
50|$|Alpha Waves was {{initially}} released on the Atari ST. This version is notable for allowing two players to compete simultaneously. It lacked music {{entirely on the}} Atari 520ST, because of insufficient memory to store the music samples. On Atari 1040ST and later models, the theme song played during the intro. The music was stored on the second side of the floppy disk, since any Atari ST with enough memory also had a dual-sided floppy drive. A promotional version {{of the program was}} distributed by a French magazine on <b>single-sided</b> floppy <b>disks,</b> crashing any machine with more than 512K of memory.|$|R
50|$|FileWare drives are 5¼-inch double-sided, {{but are not}} {{mechanically}} {{compatible with}} industry-standard diskettes. In a <b>single-sided</b> floppy <b>disk</b> drive, the disk head is opposed by a foam pressure pad. In a normal double-sided floppy disk drive, {{the top and bottom}} heads are almost directly opposed to each other. Apple was concerned about head wear, and instead designed the FileWare drive such that the top and bottom heads are {{on opposite sides of the}} spindle, and each is opposed by a pressure pad. Since there is only one actuator to move the heads, when one head is near the spindle, the other is near the outer rim of the disk.|$|R
25|$|The first Macintosh {{computers}} used <b>single-sided</b> 3½-inch floppy <b>disks,</b> {{but with}} 400 KB formatted capacity. These were followed in 1986 by double-sided 800 KB floppies. The higher capacity was achieved {{at the same}} recording density by varying the disk rotation speed with head position so that the linear speed of the disk was closer to constant. Later Macs could also read and write 1.44 MB HD disks in PC format with fixed rotation speed.|$|R
50|$|In January 1986, Apple {{introduced}} the Macintosh Plus {{which had a}} Sony double-sided 800K capacity disk drive, and used the new HFS disk format providing directories and sub-directories. This drive was fitted into an external case as the Macintosh 800K External Drive (M0131), which was slimmer than the earlier 400K drive. It could be used with Macintosh models except for the original 128K, which could not load the HFS disk format. The drive supported the older 400K <b>single-sided</b> <b>disks</b> allowing them to be shared. The use of Apple's GCR with variable speed (as used on the 400K drive) accommodated a higher storage capacity than its 720K PC counterparts. In addition, the mechanism was much quieter and significantly faster than its predecessor. Designed primarily to run on Macs with the new 128K ROM which contained the necessary code to support the drive, {{it could be used}} with Macs with older 64K ROMs if the proper software was loaded from the system folder of a Hard Disk 20 into the Mac's RAM. The drive controlled its own speed and was no longer dependent on an external signal from the Mac, which was blocked on the early drive mechanisms compatible only with the Macintosh. Later universal mechanisms, first used on the Apple II to accommodate proprietary signals, required special cables to isolate the speed signal from the Mac, to prevent damage to the drive. However, with its increased storage capacity combined with 2-4x RAM available on the Mac Plus, the external drive was less of a necessity than it had been with its predecessors. Nevertheless, with the only option for adding additional storage being extremely expensive hard drives, a year later Apple increased the maximum number of floppy drives that could be accessed simultaneously to three on the Macintosh SE (the Macintosh Portable was the only other Mac to do so).|$|R
5000|$|The {{successor}} to the Model III was the TRS-80 Model 4 (April 1983, with [...] "4" [...] written as an Arabic numeral). It had faster Z80A 4 MHz CPU, a larger video display 80 columns x 24 rows, bigger keyboard, and could be upgraded to 128KB of RAM. The Model 4 was fully compatible with Model III software and industry-standard CP/M applications software. A diskless Model 4 (with 16KB RAM) cost $999, with 64KB RAM and one <b>single-sided</b> 180K <b>disk</b> drive $1699, and two drives $1999; an upgrade for Model III owners cost $799 and provided a new motherboard and keyboard. Tandy sold 71,000 in 1984. The new computer used exactly the same all-in-one cabinet as the Model III, but instead of the silvery-gray plastic formerly used the Model 4's case was off-white.|$|R
5000|$|The Commodore 1570 is a 5¼" [...] {{floppy disk}} drive for the Commodore 128 home/personal computer. It is a single-sided, 170 kB version of the Commodore 1571, {{released}} as a stopgap measure when Commodore International was unable to provide large enough quantities of 1571s due to a shortage of double-sided drive mechanisms (supplied from an outside manufacturer). Like the 1571, it can read and write both GCR and MFM disk formats.The 1570 utilizes a 1571 logic board in a cream-colored original-1541-like case with a drive mechanism similar to the 1541's {{except that it was}} equipped with track-zero detection. Like the 1571, its built-in DOS provides a data burst mode for transferring data to the C128 computer at a faster speed than a 1541 can. Its ROM also contains some DOS bug fixes that didn't appear in the 1571 until much later. The 1570 can read and write all <b>single-sided</b> CP/M-format <b>disks</b> that the 1571 can access.|$|R
50|$|The Software Toolworks in 1981 {{released}} The Original Adventure. Endorsed by Crowther and Woods, it was {{the only}} version for which they received royalties. Microsoft released Adventure in 1981 with its initial version of MS-DOS 1.0 as a launch title for the IBM PC, making it the first game available for the new computer. It was released on a <b>single-sided</b> 5 inch <b>disk,</b> required 32K RAM, and booted directly from the disk; it could not be opened from DOS. Microsoft's Adventure contained 130 rooms, 15 treasures, 40 useful objects and 12 problems to be solved. The progress of two games could be saved on a diskette. Later versions of the game moved away from general purpose programming languages such as C or Fortran, and were instead written for special interactive fiction engines, such as Infocom's Z-machine.|$|R
5000|$|Competitors {{were more}} skeptical. Adam Osborne said [...] "when {{you buy a}} {{computer}} from IBM, you buy a la carte. By the time you have a computer that does anything, it will cost more than an Apple. I don't think Apple has anything to worry about." [...] Apple's Mike Markkula agreed that IBM's product was {{more expensive than the}} Apple II, and claimed that the Apple III [...] "offers better performance". He denied that the IBM PC offered more memory, stating that his company could offer more than 128K [...] "but frankly we don't know what anyone would do with that memory". At Tandy, John Roach said [...] "I don't think it's that significant"; Jon Shirley admitted that IBM had a [...] "legendary service reputation" [...] but claimed that its thousands of Radio Shack stores [...] "can provide better service", while predicting that the IBM PC's [...] "major market will be IBM addicts"; another executive claimed that Tandy could undersell a $3,000 IBM computer by $1,000. Many criticized the PC's design as not innovative and outdated, and believed that its alleged weaknesses, {{such as the use of}} <b>single-sided,</b> single-density <b>disks</b> with less storage than the computer's RAM, existed because the company was uncertain about the market and was experimenting before releasing a better computer. (Estridge later boasted, [...] "Many ... said that there was nothing technologically new in this machine. That was the best news we could have had; we actually had done what we had set out to do.") ...|$|R
2500|$|The Macintosh {{contained}} a single 400KB, <b>single-sided</b> 3.5-inch floppy <b>disk</b> drive, dedicating no space to other internal mechanical storage. The Mac OS was disk-based from the beginning, as RAM {{had to be}} conserved, but this [...] "Startup Disk" [...] could still be temporarily ejected. (Ejecting the root filesystem remained an unusual feature of the classic Mac OS until System 7.) One floppy disk was sufficient to store the System Software, an application and the data files created with the application. Indeed, the 400KB drive capacity was larger than the PC XT's 360KB 5.25-inch drive. However, more sophisticated work environments of the time required separate disks for documents and the system installation. Due to the memory constraints (128 KB) of the original Macintosh, {{and the fact that}} the floppies could hold 400 KB, users frequently had to swap disks in and out of the floppy drive. [...] For this reason, external floppy drives were frequently used. [...] The Macintosh External Disk Drive (mechanically identical to the internal one, piggybacking on the same controller) was a popular add-on at US $495. Third-party hard drives were considerably more expensive and usually connected to the slower serial port (as specified by Apple), though a few manufacturers chose to use the faster non-standard floppy port. The 128K can only use the original Macintosh File System for storage.|$|R
