5|$|Many of Oldham's present {{divisions}} and suburbs have origins as pre-industrial hamlets, manorial commons and ancient chapelries. Some, such as Moorside, exist as recently constructed residential <b>suburbia,</b> whilst places like Hollinwood exist as electoral wards and thoroughly industrialised districts. Throughout {{most of its}} recorded history, Oldham was surrounded by large swathes of moorland, which {{is reflected in the}} placenames of Moorside, Greenacres moor, Littlemoor, Northmoor among others.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{formerly}} being working class, Summer Hill {{and many}} of the surrounding suburbs have gradually undergone gentrification over recent years. Culturally, Summer Hill is a blend of medium-density European Sydney <b>suburbia,</b> with Italian influences (which are most evident in Leichhardt to the east and Haberfield to the north), Asian (mainly Chinese) influences (which are most strongly evident in Ashfield to the West), and smaller influences from many other cultures.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Pope Nicholas I, {{in a letter}} sent to Michael III on September 28, 865, {{mentions}} that the <b>suburbia</b> of the imperial capital were recently raided by the pagans who were allowed to retreat without any punishment. The Venetian Chronicle of John the Deacon reports that the Normanorum gentes, having devastated the suburbanum of Constantinople, returned to their own lands in triumph ("et sic praedicta gens cum triumpho ad propriam regressa est").|$|E

5|$|The Chumscrubber is a 2005 American-German comedy-drama film, {{directed}} by Arie Posin, starring an ensemble cast led by Jamie Bell. The plot, written by Posin and Zac Stanford, {{focuses on the}} {{chain of events that}} follow the suicide of a teenage drug dealer in an idealistic but superficial town. Some of the themes addressed in the film are the lack of communication between teenagers and their parents and the inauthenticity of <b>suburbia.</b> The titular Chumscrubber is a character in a fictional video game that represents the town and its inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} {{built in the}} mid-18th century {{as part of the}} New Road, a bypass of Central London for coach traffic. It was named Pentonville Road after the new town of Pentonville, that encouraged manufacturing {{to move out of the}} city and into <b>suburbia.</b> Numerous factories and commercial premises became established on the road in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly after the arrival of London railways in the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|By 1964 over 20,000 {{new homes}} had been built, {{transforming}} the dense overcrowded and unsanitary slums of the pre-war city into a low density, dispersed <b>suburbia.</b> Most {{of the city}} centre shops had been destroyed and those that remained were cleared to enable a zoned reconstruction according to his plan. In 1962 the modernist high rise of the Civic Centre was constructed, an architecturally significant example of mid-twentieth century civic slab-and-tower set piece. The Plymouth City Council allowed it to fall into disrepair but it was grade II listed in 2010 by English Heritage to prevent its demolition.|$|E

50|$|When the MRC block started, it faced {{very low}} ratings against other {{networks}} (especially with FOX's Animation Domination). After {{only a few}} weeks the CW pulled the entire block and announced that the status of <b>Suburbia's</b> air date was TBA. An additional factor in schecduling changes may have been the fact that Media Rights Capital had been unable {{to keep up with the}} set production schedule and had begun running out of episodes. CW never released any announcements concerning the series' air date.|$|R

5|$|While {{many critics}} refer to film noir as a genre itself, {{others argue that}} it can be no such thing. While noir is often {{associated}} with an urban setting, many classic noirs take place in small towns, <b>suburbia,</b> rural areas, or on the open road; setting, therefore, cannot be its genre determinant, as with the Western. Similarly, while the private eye and the femme fatale are character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of film noirs feature neither; so there is no character basis for genre designation as with the gangster film. Nor does film noir rely on anything as evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements of the horror film, the speculative leaps of the science fiction film, or the song-and-dance routines of the musical.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the {{automotive}} industry and others were directly responsible for the decline of public transportation. The Great American streetcar scandal saw GM, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, Mack Trucks and other companies purchase a number of streetcars and electric trains in the 1930s and 1940s, such that 90percent of city trolleys had been dismantled by 1950. It was argued {{that this was a}} deliberate destruction of streetcars {{as part of a larger}} strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency. In United States v. National City Lines, Inc., many were found guilty of antitrust violations. The story has been explored several times in print, film and other media, for example in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Taken for a Ride and The End of <b>Suburbia.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a series}} of photographs produced by American artist Larry Sultan (1946 - 2009) titled, Homeland. Made between 2006 and 2009 —a financially tumultuous period when {{the collapse of the}} US housing market would precipitate what was known as the Great Recession—the images depict suburban landscapes populated by immigrant day laborers. In treating these sites as staged fictions, Sultan introduces visual and narrative ambiguities, which, I argue, reveal the complex underpinnings of <b>suburbia’s</b> social and aesthetic construction. Focusing on Creek, Santa Rosa (2009) as an exemplary work from the series, the paper traces the narrative anomalies of the picture, alongside the technical specificities of the photograph’s production, in order to present an allegorical framework through which the larger socio-economic conditions of labor and the fragile economies of home might newly be addressed...|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in <b>suburbia,</b> they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E
5|$|Tonkin Highway reaches {{past the}} edge of <b>suburbia</b> at its {{southern}} extent. Planning provides {{for it to be}} extended when required. The initial plans indicated the extension would continue south through undeveloped or semi-rural areas such as Mundijong, Cardup & Jarrahdale. South of Mundijong, the planned route would deviate east to terminate at South Western Highway near Jarrahdale Road, which would then be upgraded. Following the 2001state election, the new government abandoned the Jarrahdale Road option, preferring a shorter route that deviated to South Western Highway near Orton Street, closer to Byford. In July 2012, seven years after the previous extension was completed, the Minister for Transport announced the formation of a community working group to investigate an extension of Tonkin Highway beyond Thomas Road. The group met several times to identify and evaluate possible solutions to traffic congestion in the area, and prepare a strategic business case for the next extension. , the preferred options are to extend the highway to South Western Highway, at a location either south of Lakes Road or south of Mundijong Road.|$|E

40|$|The exhibition, 'Where Happiness Happens' was {{the outcome}} of 12 months’ {{research}} exploring the relationship between aspiration and the suburbs. It depicted the suburbs as a social and cultural hybrid, reinforced within the house by the nuances and idiosyncrasies of decoration and material culture. These idiosyncrasies were described in the work by small moments of aspirational creativity: men construct model railways or customize low spec cars. It questions <b>suburbia’s</b> status as a landscape of conformity and compromise, and proposes the notion that diversity and enterprise positively thrive in the British suburbs. This work references the depiction of British suburban aspiration, failure and compromise through television comedy. Evans sought to question the use and viability of the suburban caricature through a painterly visual narrative, mindful of contemporary problematic stereotypes. Using photographic documentation to inform {{the development of the}} paintings, Evans presented a form of constructed reality through the investigation of the properties of acrylic paint and to establish a convincing schematic visual depiction...|$|R

40|$|Under {{is located}} in <b>suburbia's</b> {{marginal}} space, defined as the open territories between the city boundary and the countryside: these are spaces that are generated as inevitable by-products of urban spatial development. The site and the BMX trails pictured exist {{in this sort of}} 'non-place', outside of cultural classification. The county council theoretically owns the land but they do not enforce any regulations or safety legislation here; the trails are not signposted locally or marked on maps and the exact location is not clearly defined on websites. Therefore to all intents and purposes it is a space that does not officially exist - this adds to the mystery of the site. I have presented the mud constructions on the 'trails' as enigmatic structures: their physical presence mirroring the ambiguous landscape around them. The images can be viewed as evidence of other unseen things but implicit within the objects pictured are ideas about land-use, settlement, earth building methodology, arguably encoded in a kind of primitivist nostalgia. There is a continual tension between what the photographs describe and what they reveal. I am exploiting the potential of photography's indexicality - when it is at its most factual is often when it is most obscure...|$|R
