500|$|Dawson's initial {{inspiration}} {{came from}} a visit to The Orchard, an inn in Grantchester where she encountered a photograph of maids who had been there while Brooke was in residence there from 1909–1914. The Orchard became the primary setting of The Great Lover and the maids inspired {{the creation of the}} character Nell Golightly. Dawson choose to write about Brooke because she was intrigued by his personality and why women kept falling in love with him. To explore Brooke's personality, <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> the question [...] "What if Rupert Brooke put a note under one of these floorboards—a note, in a way, just for me?" [...] She also was particularly interested in capturing the essence of Grantchester, the primary setting for the novel.|$|E
60|$|Thoughts came to her, as <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> that question, {{which have}} startled and saddened us all.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What is he {{thinking}} of?' <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself.</b> Her thoughts flashed back. 'And {{why did he}} ask me so peculiarly {{whether he}} should wire them at home?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Love {{says she}} favors [...] "fiscal discipline, limited government, and {{personal}} responsibility." [...] She has {{also said that}} <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> <b>herself</b> three questions whenever she approaches an issue: [...] "Is it affordable? Is it sustainable? Is it my job?" ...|$|R
60|$|All {{the time}} <b>she</b> was <b>asking</b> <b>herself</b> {{how much he}} knew. She motioned him to proceed.|$|R
50|$|Gaia: Set in 2003, {{it tells}} the last moments {{of the life of}} Alma Echegaray, who has been {{unjustly}} sentenced to die on the electric chair by Georgia's governor, Joe Hamilton. <b>She</b> <b>asks</b> <b>herself</b> why has this happened, since she never hated anyone before. This traumatic event leads her soul to seek for revenge.|$|R
60|$|He had {{discovered}} a reason. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> breathlessly what might that reason be, and finding herself no answer to the question, she put it next to him.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} it, {{and put it}} down again. [...] "Why should I read it," [...] <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself,</b> [...] "when I know what is in it, without reading?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{can it be}} possible," [...] <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself,</b> as a tear or two {{began to}} show {{themselves}} in her eyes, [...] "that Ralph could be so cruel as that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What are {{you going}} to do with him?" [...] said Mrs. Hammond, {{regarding}} her infant as if <b>she</b> often <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> the same question about her boy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that," [...] <b>she</b> <b>asked,</b> {{throwing}} <b>herself</b> into an easy-chair and {{selecting a}} cigarette, [...] "just an ordinary {{type of a}} nice, well-bred, unintelligent, self-sufficient Englishman, or--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>asked.</b> <b>She</b> {{answered}} <b>herself</b> at once, with {{a curious}} change from rapid speech {{to an almost}} melancholy tone. [...] "I think you're very wise to give it up. You will be much happier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What shall I do? Shall I tell Aunt Lida?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself,</b> {{and ended}} by {{kneeling}} down and praying to Jesus {{to give the}} young man a new heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must go to}} Delphi, of course," [...] she said. [...] "But," [...] <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself,</b> [...] "what do I {{want from}} him? Perhaps it is {{something}} that I have missed...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{why does}} the king want all these tailors and hatters so suddenly, telescope-makers and swordmakers and shoemakers, too?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself,</b> as {{she stood at the}} window {{watching}} the moon.|$|E
5000|$|Right before {{beginning}} to write, <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> <b>herself</b> three questions: [...] "What {{is the story}} about; what is my attitude toward the story; and what is my purpose for writing it?" [...] Then, she {{comes up with a}} theme statement in three sentences that is attached to her computer screen. After that, she writes a timeline and plans characters. When she finally gets to writing the book, she says, [...] "I have an idea for the start and end and then I just start writing." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{convention}} {{has not yet}} died out. I {{was reading}} the other day a most interesting book by a brilliant American authoress. Seeing I live {{far away from the}} lady's haunts, I venture to mention names. I am speaking of [...] "Patience Sparhawk," [...] by Gertrude Atherton. I take this book because it is typical of a large body of fiction. Miss Sparhawk lives a troubled life: it puzzles her. <b>She</b> <b>asks</b> <b>herself</b> what is wrong. Her own idea is that it is civilisation.|$|R
60|$|Was once lost always lost {{really true}} of chastity? <b>she</b> would <b>ask</b> <b>herself.</b> <b>She</b> might prove it false {{if she could}} veil bygones. The recuperative power which pervaded organic nature was surely not denied to maidenhood alone.|$|R
6000|$|Lee's {{mind was}} off now on another tangent. [...] "Suppose it is true?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself.</b> [...] "Suppose he has fallen sick away up there, {{miles and miles}} from any nurse or doctor--" ...|$|E
60|$|And at last <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> another question,--had she {{any special}} liking for Mr. Gibson? As {{far as she}} {{understood}} such matters everything was blank there. Thinking of that other question, she went to sleep.|$|E
60|$|Annie {{wanted to}} laugh too, {{but she did}} not like his laughing. She {{questioned}} if it were not undignified. She felt that it might be disrespectful. Then <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> why he should respect her.|$|E
60|$|In a {{very few}} days, Kate had been settled into {{the ways of the}} {{household}} in Bruton Street; and found one day so like another, that <b>she</b> sometimes <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> whether <b>she</b> had not been living there years instead of days.|$|R
5000|$|In a 2008 CNN interview, Ford {{said that}} when making music videos <b>she</b> often <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> whether <b>she</b> was [...] "perpetuating a {{negative}} stereotype" [...] about black women. When <b>she</b> was <b>asked</b> whether music videos, overall, are [...] "demeaning to women", Ford replied, [...] "Yes, I definitely have to say that".|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him intently, and an {{observer}} might have said that <b>she</b> was <b>asking</b> <b>herself</b> whether <b>she</b> might not most quickly end their common pain by confessing that she was mocking him. [...] "No; I am not," [...] she presently said.|$|R
60|$|She {{suddenly}} turned pale. All {{the love that}} she had in her to give to a man, she had given to Amelius. Her heart sank; <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself,</b> in blank terror, if she had lost him.|$|E
60|$|As <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> this {{question}} one day, feeling sure that Mr. Fletcher {{would come in}} the evening, and would soon put his fortune to the touch again, the thought of Mrs. Wilkins seemed to answer her.|$|E
6000|$|She {{fell into}} thought--thought that only deepened {{the grave and}} gentle {{composure}} of her face. [...] "Shall I write him a farewell word?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself.</b> [...] "Shall I tell him the truth before I leave him forever?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Miss Batchelor is {{a retired}} missionary schoolteacher who lives with Mabel Layton at Rose Cottage. Barbie is a simple, down-to-earth woman, who {{believes}} strongly in her god and in egalitarian Christianity and has clear ideas about right and wrong. She is troubled that in all her years of missionary work, she was not very successful in converting the children in her charge to Christianity ("How many of them did I bring to God?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> <b>herself.)</b> Above all, Barbie wants to be useful {{and to have a}} role in the society in which she lives.|$|R
6000|$|Herminia {{looked at}} him hard in return. Her cheeks were glowing now with {{something}} like the shame {{of the woman who}} feels her love is lightly rejected. [...] "Is that final?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>asked,</b> drawing <b>herself</b> up as she sat, and facing him proudly.|$|R
60|$|The {{old lady}} turned towards me sharply. She peered right through me, {{as if she}} were a Röntgen ray. I could see <b>she</b> was <b>asking</b> <b>herself</b> whether this was a conspiracy, and whether I had come there on purpose to meet 'Harold.' But I flatter myself I am tolerably {{mistress}} of my own countenance. I did not blench. 'How do you know?' <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> quickly, with an acid intonation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Annie, {{and with}} a thrill of dismay <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself</b> how much she had let her manner betray that she had {{supposed}} he was a book agent. [...] "I shall be very glad indeed, Mr. Brandreth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why has he {{not written}} to me," [...] <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself,</b> [...] "and {{why should he}} have gone away without a word of greeting, explanation, or good-bye? It would have taken but a moment's time to call at the door." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Vanborough {{staggered}} back. She {{caught at}} the white curtains of the window to save herself from falling, and tore them. She looked at her husband, with the torn curtain clenched fast in her hand. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>herself,</b> [...] "Am I mad? or is he?" ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. Oh, what nonsense! When a man's as {{attentive}} {{to a girl}} as George has been to you <b>she</b> can't help <b>asking</b> <b>herself</b> if she'd like to marry him or not.|$|R
60|$|They {{both laughed}} again, for {{whatever}} reason or no reason, and then the young girl became sober. To a girl everything a young man does is of significance; and if he holds a shaving down with his foot while she pokes through it with her parasol, <b>she</b> must <b>ask</b> <b>herself</b> what he means by it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, there is, when you've got a {{girl like}} Lottie to deal with. Quite likely <b>she</b> would <b>ask</b> him <b>herself.</b> We must take him because we can't leave her." ...|$|R
