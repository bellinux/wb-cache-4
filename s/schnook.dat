HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Cole's return was as much fun as I hoped it would be - in some ways, even better than his first appearance in season two's 'Chuck vs. the Delorean,' where I liked Sarah and Jack's interaction but thought the actual con job was a bit thin.

But once Jack turned up in Burbank to help his daughter and her <b>schnook</b> of a fiance be heroes and get back in the good graces of General Beckman, 'Wedding Planner' was really very strong, both as a comedy piece (loved Yvonne Strahovski's accent as she impersonated Daphne) and another story about Sarah's colorful but ultimately sad past." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{scene in}} a wood. Beetzie and Musiker hide behind a bush as they watch Captain Bristlepunkt and his followers, the Purple Shirties, induct Private Aloysius <b>Schnook</b> as a new recruit. The Purple Shirties sing their version of Musiker's tune ("How {{peaceful}} is our captain!"). The induction ceremony begins as <b>Schnook</b> reveals he joined only to retain his business clients. Captain Bristlepunkt urges <b>Schnook</b> to vow death to the mongrels who [...] "run the stores and banks in evâ€™ry town", whips <b>Schnook,</b> and then has <b>Schnook</b> whip himself. Horrified by the scene, Beetzie and Musiker run away.|$|E
5000|$|He {{slept through}} the {{phone call from the}} Nobel Prize Committee. When he woke up, he knew the prize would have been {{announced}} already, so he said [...] "Okay, who's the <b>schnook</b> that got the Prize this time?" [...] And so he opened up his laptop, got to the Nobel Prize site and found out that he was the <b>schnook!</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|The title Springtime for Hitler {{was first}} coined by Brooks {{as a joke}} during the press conference for All American in 1962. Shortly afterwards, he also decided to relate this title to a {{character}} named Leo Bloom, an homage to Leopold Bloom, protagonist of James Joyce's Ulysses. It was reused by him years later once he had an idea about [...] "two <b>schnooks</b> on Broadway who set out to produce a flop and swindle the backers." [...] The inspiration was some people Brooks met during his early show business days: Benjamin Kutcher, a New York producer who financed his plays by sleeping with elderly women, {{became the basis for}} Max Bialystock, and the scheme had origins in two theater producers who had a lavish lifestyle while making various unsuccessful plays. When imagining what play [...] "would have people packing up and leaving the theatre even before the first act is over," [...] Brooks decided to combine Adolf Hitler and a musical.|$|R
50|$|Gus Brubaker (Dick Shawn) is a {{self-described}} <b>schnook.</b> Soon {{after the end}} of the Korean War, his wife talks him into applying for G.I. insurance for which he is eligible from his World War II service with the Air Force. Gus is reluctant because he was shot down and became a prisoner of war, but the military listed him as killed. A red-tape foulup results in Gus being back in uniform, assigned to a ramshackle radar station on a backwater island near Shima, Japan. Boredom has made the airmen assigned there apathetic, slovenly, and unmotivated. Its equipment and supplies are a collection of junk, abandoned or surplus.|$|E
5000|$|On November 13, 1965 Sherman made a rare {{prime time}} {{television}} acting appearance in [...] "The Sheriff of Fetterman's Crossing," [...] {{an episode of}} Rod Serling's short-lived Western series The Loner (1965-66). Sherman played Walton Peterson Tetley, a local <b>schnook</b> who went off to war and rose to regiment cook before returning home a hero thanks to tall tales and yarn-spinning. The town hails its conquering hero and Tetley is appointed sheriff. Series star Lloyd Bridges as William Colton, a wandering Union veteran, comes to town and signs on to be Tetley's deputy, discovering quickly his boss' utter incompetence in the office. Tetley receives a threatening note from a gunslinger challenging this purported hero to a gunfight when he arrives on the noon stage, {{at which point the}} story becomes a parody of iconic Western movie High Noon (1952). Colton sets to teaching the shivering in his boots sheriff courage and gunmanship. Sherman's semi-serious and sympathetic performance was strong and his presence an affable one.|$|E
50|$|Michael Makeshift (Jason Alexander) is a <b>schnook</b> who can't {{get over}} the fact his girlfriend dumped him. To make matters worse, his {{landlord}} is beginning to bug him for long-overdue rent. Things for Michael's brother Reggie (James Woods) are much better. He is planning to rob the credit union where his own mother (Bea Arthur) works. His new wife Valerie (Lolita Davidovitch) {{has no idea what}} Reggie is planning and is therefore puzzled when she awakes at Michael's apartment after Reggie left her there whilst she was drunk and unconscious. She also does not know that Reggie has paid Michael for the favor. Despite his well-laid plans, things go badly for Reggie when his henchmen mutiny and force him to reveal that the clueless Valerie carries the security codes they need to pull off the job in her suitcase, which in turn begins a merry chase. While Michael helps Valerie escape, he reveals the truth about Reggie. At the same time, she becomes increasingly attracted to her new protector.|$|E
