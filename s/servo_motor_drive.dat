This definition reveals the elements involved yet it eludes to the complexity and the constant balance of tradeoffs which are prevalent in the context of applying Mechatronics to a successful design process. This work pursues the use of various tools for the application of Mechatronics to the modeling and design of a <b>servo</b> <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> motion system. The use of Mechatronics is pervasive in and among today 2 ̆ 7 s highly integrated devices and systems. By virtue {{of the fact that the}} phrase 2 ̆ 2 Mechatronics 2 ̆ 2 may carry different meaning depending upon ones discipline or industry, the most general definition is sought and embodied within the work. An overview of the relevant discipline specific perspectives is offered; as sufficient background for the systems modeling and analysis presented. In the course of developing and applying a Mechatronics design process for <b>servo</b> <b>motor</b> actuated motion systems, the use of frequency response analysis and alternative modeling techniques is emphasized, not only as a tool for understanding and applying the matter but, also for the purposes of model verification.

40|$|In this paper, {{the initial}} pole-position {{estimation}} of a surface (non-salient) permanent magnet synchronous motor is mathematically analyzed and surveyed {{on the basis}} of simulation analysis, and developed for accurate <b>servo</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drive.</b> This algorithm is well carried out under the full closed-loop position control without any pole sensors and is completely insensitive to any motor parameters. This estimation is based on the principle that the initial pole-position is simply calculated by the reverse trigonometric function using the two feedback currents in the full closed-loop position control. The proposed algorithm consists of the predefined reference position profile, the information of feedback currents, speed, and relative position, and the reverse trigonometric function for the initial-pole position estimation. Comparing with the existing researches, the mathematical analysis is introduced to get a more accurate initial pole-position of the surface permanent magnet motor under the closed-loop position control.

The profilometer has large measuring range, {{high precision}} and small measuring touch force. It {{is composed of}} a two-dimensional (2 D) displacement sensor, a 3 D platform based on vertical scanning, measuring and control circuits and an industrial control computer. When a workpiece is measured, the vertical undulation of the profile at a sampling point leads to a zero offset of the 2 D displacement sensor. According to the zero offset, a piezoelectric actuator and a <b>servo</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> the vertical scanning platform to move vertically {{to ensure that the}} lever returns to its balance position. So the non-linear error caused by the rotation of the lever is very small even if the measuring range is large. When the stylus barges up against a steep wall, the horizontal resistance force results in another zero offset of the 2 D displacement sensor. If the zero offset exceeds a quota, the vertical scanning platform descends to make the stylus climb the steep wall successfully.

40|$|Abstract. Controlling a biped robot with a {{high degree}} of freedom to achieve stable {{movement}} patterns is still an open and complex problem, in particular within the RoboCup community. Thus, the development of control mechanisms for biped locomotion have become an important field of research. In this paper we introduce a model-free approach of biped motion generation, which specifies target angles for all driven joints and is based on a neural oscillator. It is potentially capable to control any <b>servo</b> <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> biped robot, in particular those {{with a high}} degree of freedom, and requires only the identification of the robot’s physical constants in order to provide an adequate simulation. The approach was implemented and successfully tested within a physical simulation of our target system- the 19 -DoF Bioloid robot. The crucial task of identifying and optimizing appropriate parameter sets for this method was tackled using evolutionary algorithms. We could show, that the presented approach is applicable in generating walking patterns for the simulated biped robot. The work demonstrates, how the important parameters may be identified and optimized when applying evolutionary algorithms. Several so evolved controllers were capable of generating a robust biped walking behavior with relatively high walking speeds, even without using sensory information. In addition we present first results of laboratory experiments, where some of the evolved motions were tried to transfer to real hardware. ...|$|R
40|$|In this research, a new {{approach}} to develop an object pushing system with a simple mobile robot with two DC <b>servo</b> <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> wheels and two castor wheels are introduced. This is an attempt to design and develop a system with less number of sensors to detect the reaction force generated on the mobile robot while pushing an object. The robot behavior is such that it always tends to push the object towards the center of the pusher attached to the robot. This is achieved by rotating one driving wheel of the robot by a fixed amount of rotation. This rotation is such that the motor torque is increased continuously by increasing the motor driving positive pulse width of the pulse width modulated signal from its neutral position until the required amount or rotation is obtained. At this moment the motor stops and the wheel attached to the other motor follows the same operation. This motion creates a zigzag movement on the pushing plate attached in front of the robot. This zigzag motion always moves the object towards the centre of the pusher. When the object comes close to the centre of the pusher the force applied from both motors becomes equal. Detection of this force is done by using the positive pulse width of the motor and the encoder pulses generated by the optical encoder attached to both wheels of the robot. The test results are given to support the proposed approach...|$|R

Second, the maximum earthquake displacement can not be larger than the table. s displacement capacity. In the present work, the recorded strong motion acceleration time series are processed in order to obtain useful data for engineering analysis. Strong motion accelerogram processing (earthquake data processing) is performed in Scilab.

The processing concentrates on the lowfrequency ranges of the usable signal in the records. The results obtained from comparison of the present work's outputs and some data providers' outputs are satisfactory.
