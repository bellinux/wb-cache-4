The year 1961 saw major progress in academics at the institute with the construction of the Gaerttner Linear Accelerator, then the most powerful in the world, and the Jonsson-Rowland Science Center. In addition to new academic buildings, the growing student body also needed a larger student union, which was finished in 1967.|$|E

30|$|The {{application}} of lithium-ion battery is playing {{an important role}} in the development of portable electric and electro vehicles. Graphite has dominated as the anode material of lithium-ion batteries and has been commercialized for many years due to its excellent behaviour during prolonged charge/discharge cycles. However, the theoretical capacity of graphite is limited to 372  mAh/g, which is low relative to the requirement of high energy density application fields [1]. To develop a low-cost electrode material with a high energy capacity is of great significance to improve the performance of products that use rechargeable batteries. Crystal Si has attracted much attention as a possible anode candidate due to the much higher lithium storage capacity (4200  mAh/g, about ten times higher than graphite), low lithium alloying/dealloying potential, long discharge plateau and natural abundance [2]. However, Si-based anodes also face grand challenges due to the large volume expansion (about 400  %) of the Si particles during lithiation/delithiation processes. It results in pulverization, breaks the electrical contact of the electrode structure and brings in great capacity decay [3]. The lack of electrical contacts between Si particles or between Si and current collector even makes capacity fading worse. Many investigations have been done to accommodate this severe volume expansion, mainly including novel nanostructured Si such as Si wires [4], Si tubes [5], porous Si thin films [6] and nest-like Si nanospheres [7] or multiphase composites consisting of active Si and other active/inactive phases [8, 9]. Among these materials, Si-based composites containing Si and coating other ductile materials as buffer were conducted to reduce volume expansion. Carbon, metal, metal oxide and conducting polymers are used as the shell materials, which can act as both conducting and mechanical supporting material [10 – 14]. Among them, the coating of metal and metal oxide on Si electrodes will be a good way to improve their electrochemical performances. Due to the introduction of the <b>surplus</b> <b>metal</b> Cu in the coating layer, it has been proved to greatly increase the electrical conductivity in a Si-based anode system and help buffer the volume changes during insertion/extraction processes of lithium ions [15 – 17].|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} parts of interconnects for silicon based logic and memory devices consist of metal wiring (e. g. copper), a barrier metal (Ta, TaN), and of insulation (SiO 2, low-k polymer). The deposition of the conducting metal cannot {{be confined to}} trenches, resulting in additional coverage of Cu and Ta/TaN {{on the surface of}} the dielectrics, yielding an electrically conducting continuous but an uneven surface. The <b>surplus</b> <b>metal</b> must be removed until a perfectly flat surface consisting of electrically isolated metal lines is achieved with no imperfections. This task is accomplished by the chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) process, in which the wafer is polished with a slurry containing abrasives of finely dispersed particles in submicrometer to nanometer size. The slurries also contain dissolved chemicals to modify the surfaces to be planarized. Eventually the final product must be cleared of any adhered particles and debris left after polishing is completed. Obviously the entire process deals with materials and interactions which are the focal subjects of colloid and surface science, such as the natures of abrasive particles and their stability in the slurry, the properties of various surfaces and their modifications, adhesion and detachment of the particles and different methods for the characterization of constituents, as well as elucidation of the relevant interfacial phenomena. This review endeavors to describe the colloid approach to optimize the materials and processes in order to achieve desirable polish rates and final surfaces with no imperfections. Specifically, the effects of the composition, size, shape, and charge of abrasive particles on the polish process and the quality of planarized wafers is described in detail. Furthermore, the interactions of metal surfaces with oxidizing, chelating, and other species which affect the dissolution and surface modification of metal (copper) surfaces are illustrated and related to the planarization process. Finally, using the packed column technique the adhesion phenomena of abrasives on metals and oxides is evaluated on suitable model systems, that contain the same additives in the slurries as in the actual planarization process. A close correlation is established in all cases between the attachment and detachment results with experimentally determined polish rates...|$|E

This lake was man-made in 2005 and filled by natural surface runoff until January 2006. In summer 2006 and 2008, the actual development of sediments {{and the evolution of}} the phosphorus (P) cycle were studied. 19. 7 % of the original lake volume was filled by sediment within the first 3 years. A fine-grained sediment representing silt (6. 3 – 63 μm) accumulated at high accretion rates at the deepest point (200 mma− 1, 0 – 24 mmweek− 1) due to massive erosion in the catchment. The sediment is low in organic matter (2. 5 – 5. 2 %) and total P (TP, 0. 31 – 0. 97 mgg− 1). Low amounts of P associated with degradable organic matter and <b>surplus</b> of <b>metal</b> hydroxides (Fe:P∼ 40, Al:P∼ 20) favor an efficient P binding and low dissolved P concentrations in pore water (1 – 107 μgl− 1). Hence, the mineral sediment quality and the low rates of P release (0. 06 mgm− 2 d− 1) revealed that a lake at an initial stage of development has essentially no sedimentary P cycle compared to eutrophic shallow lakes. However, the increasing emersed and submersed macrophyte growth will control further lake succession by intensifying the internal nutrient cycling. The macrophytes drive the evolution of a sedimentary P cycle by mobilizing and translocating P, by accumulating carbon and thus by stimulating microbial and redox processes...|$|R
40|$|The first {{results of}} the National Soil Quality Monitoring Network of the Netherlands are described. The network is a {{cooperative}} effort of the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), the Agricultural Economic Research Institute (LEI-DLO) and the Research Institute for Agrobiology and Soil Fertility (AB-DLO). The primary objective of the network is to establish changes in soil quality over time. Secondary objective is to establish the actual quality of soil and upper groundwater. Attention is focussed primarily on the rural part of the country. The monitoring program is divided evenly in time units: about 40 locations are sampled yearly. The network started in 1993 with the sampling of soil and upper groundwater on 35 cattle farms in the sandy regions of the Netherlands. The farms are divided into two categories: extensive (19) and intensive (16). These farms represent 25 % of the agricultural area in the sandy regions and 12 % of the total agricultural area of the Netherlands. The report contains information on concentrations of heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochlorine pesticides in the topsoil (0 - 10 cm). Information on concentrations of macroparameters, nutrients and heavy metals in groundwater is also presented. The measured concentrations are compared with the Dutch objectives for soil and groundwater quality (target values). No exceedance of target values was observed for heavy metals in soil. Target values {{for a number of}} individual PAHs and organochlorine pesticides were exceeded in soil. The same holds for nitrate and for a number of metals in groundwater. There are no statistical significant differences between both categories with respect to heavy metal, PAH and organochlorine concentrations in the soil. Heavy metal balances have been computed at farm level for cadmium, copper, lead and zinc. There is a balance <b>surplus</b> for all <b>metals</b> involved due to the net result of input through atmospheric deposition and farming practice (feedstuff, manure and fertilizer) and output as a result of leaching to the groundwater. Therefore it is concluded that accumulation of heavy metals occurs. However, there is no correlation between the actual balance <b>surplus</b> and present <b>metal</b> concentrations in the soil.

These pits would need to be safely disassembled and permanently converted to an unclassified form that would be suitable for long-term disposition and international inspection. To determine the feasibility of an integrated pit disassembly and conversion system, a Pit Disassembly and Conversion Demonstration is proposed to take place at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). This demonstration would be done in existing buildings and facilities, and would involve the disassembly of up to 250 pits and conversion of the recovered plutonium to plutonium metal ingots and plutonium dioxide. This demonstration also includes the conversion of up to 80 kilograms of clean plutonium metal to plutonium dioxide because, as part of the disposition process, some <b>surplus</b> plutonium <b>metal</b> may be converted to plutonium dioxide in the same facility as the surplus pits.

40|$|Accounting for {{agricultural}} {{activities such as}} P fertilization in regional models of heavy metal accumulation provides suitable sustainable management strategies to reduce nutrient <b>surpluses</b> and <b>metal</b> inputs in agricultural soils. Using the balance model PROTERRA-S, we assessed the phosphorus (P), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) flux balances in agricultural soils of a rural region in Switzerland for different farm types and crop types. The P requirements of crops on arable farms were mainly supplied by commercial fertilizers and sewage sludge, while on animal husbandry farms P fertilizer demands were met by animal manure alone. Metal accumulation in soil was very different between the balance units. Estimated net Cd fluxes ranged between 1. 0 and 2. 3 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for arable farm types, 0. 6 and 2. 0 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for dairy and mixed farm types, and 9. 1 and 17. 8 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for animal husbandry farm types. Largest net Zn fluxes of 17. 9 - 39. 8 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1) were estimated for animal husbandry farms, whereas for arable farm types net Zn fluxes of 101 - 260 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) and for dairy and mixed farm types of 349 - 3360 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) were found. The results indicate that P management is a primary factor determining the variation of these net Cd and net Zn fluxes. The latter were highly sensitive to the Zn/P concentration ratio in animal manure, atmospheric deposition and crop concentrations. Variation of net Cd fluxes resulted mainly from uncertainty in crop concentrations, atmospheric deposition, leaching parameters and uncertainty in Cd/P concentration ratio of commercial fertilizers. In addition, element balances were sensitive to empirical assumptions on fertilization strategy of farmers, such as the partitioning of manure between balance units...|$|R

The first sampling, of soil and upper groundwater, took place on 35 dairy-cattle farms in the sandy regions of the Netherlands in 1993. In 1994, 20 intensively managed cattle farms with a high phosphate production and 20 forest sites on sandy soils were sampled, while in 1995, sampling was carried out on 19 arable farms on sandy soils and 18 cattle farms on peaty soils. The primary objective of the network is to identify changes in soil quality over time. The secondary objective is to identify the actual quality of soil and upper groundwater. Attention is focused primarily on rural areas. The monitoring programme involves sampling 40 locations yearly over a period of five years. Concentrations of heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides and triazines in the topsoil (0 - 10 cm), and at a depth of 30 - 50 cm, have been reported. Concentrations of macroparameters, nutrients and heavy metals in the upper groundwater are also presented.

MoS 2 and WS 2 are materials that are of interest as potential absorbers in thin film solar cells. They are layer type semiconductors that crystallise into a characteristic sequence of S-M-S stacks (M = Mo, W). The stacks are only linked to each other weakly by van-der-Waals forces, whereas the bonds within the stacks are of a covalent nature. Analysing the stoichiometry of the films using ERDA and RBS revealed sulphur-to-metal ratios of x ≥ 2. 3, dependent on the amount of H 2 S in the sputtering gas. Stoichiometric MS 2 is however only formed at substrate temperatures below 200 °C, at which the films are practically x-ray amorphous. It was possible to prepare well crystallised films at substrate temperatures of 450 °C and above; the S/M ratio then equalled approximately x = 1. 7 - 1. 8. From in situ-EDXRD spectra which were measured with a time resolution of 20 - 30 s structural properties of the films were obtained in dependence on the deposition parameters H 2 S partial pressure, sputtering power, sputtering pressure, substrate temperature (190 - 620 °C) and film thickness. Low deposition rates {{led to the formation of}} a strong (001) texture, which is a prerequesite for high photoactivity of MS x films. At high deposition rates, the initial (001) preferential orientation of the crystallites turns into a (100) texture at a film thickness of about 20 nm to a maximum of 100 nm. X-ray reflection measurements revealed a density of the basal layer which is near to the bulk density of MS 2. Films deposited with increasing deposition rates showed densities that were up to 70 % smaller were grown and analysed by ERD which is an additional proof of the extremely porous structure of the films. The cross-over of the texture is irreversible what can be explained by different growth velocities of the crystallites in the directions perpendicular and parallel to their c-axes. A characteristic evolution of the lattice strain η of the c-axis relative to the lattice parameter of the powder materials MoS 2 and WS 2 and the relative volume of the coherently scattering crystallites which have their c-axes perpendicular to the substrate could be detected during sputtering. The strain ? of the c-axis was proved not to result from mechanical stress in the films. The values of η at the end of the depositions were up to 4 % and depended on the deposition rate for MoS x films. It is assumed that crystal defects such as dislocations, self intercalation or by analogy to graphite turbostratic growth is responsible for the c lattice strain. In combination with the <b>metal</b> <b>surplus</b> of many films in comparison to stoichiometric MS 2 the strain of the crystallographic unit cell can also be explained by the intercalation of additional metal atoms between the van-der-Waals planes. The analysis of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (0 0 2 l) reflections (l = 1, 2, 3) resulted in a grain size of up to a maximum of 60 nm (MoS x) or 14 nm (WS x). Dislocation densities of up to 3 · 10 12 cm - 2 were estimated from high resolution TEM images...|$|R
