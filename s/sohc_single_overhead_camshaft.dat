50|$|As {{popularity}} and marketing {{value of the}} VTEC system grew, Honda applied the system to <b>SOHC</b> (<b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>camshaft)</b> engines, which share a common camshaft for both intake and exhaust valves. The trade-off was that Honda's SOHC engines benefitted from the VTEC mechanism only on the intake valves. This is because VTEC requires a third center rocker arm and cam lobe (for each intake and exhaust side), and, in the SOHC engine, the spark plugs are situated between the two exhaust rocker arms, leaving no room for the VTEC rocker arm. Additionally, the center lobe on the camshaft cannot be utilized by both the intake and the exhaust, limiting the VTEC feature to one side.|$|E

50|$|The engine has a {{displacement}} of 244 cc. Along with electronic fuel injection, the water-cooled motor also has four valves and a <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>camshaft.</b> The increased engine capacity, combined with reduced emissions, gives {{a top speed}} of 118 km/h.|$|R
50|$|A {{bevel gear}} at the {{junction}} drove a vertical shaft from which the <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>camshaft</b> and dual magnetos for each bank were driven. Two magnetos were mounted {{on the outside of}} each cylinder bank. Each magneto fired all eight cylinders for that bank, driven by bevel gear from the vertical shaft that also drove the bank's <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>camshaft.</b> Each cylinder had two vertical inlet valves and a single vertical exhaust valve, all driven by rocking levers from the camshaft. Four carburettors each fed four cylinders via a water jacketed manifold. Each cylinder exhausted into an individual pipe in the space between the cylinder blocks. The whole construction was protected by patents until 1935.|$|R
50|$|The V-1710 has 12 {{cylinders}} with a bore {{and stroke}} of 5.5 by 6 in in 60° V-format, for 1710.6 cuin L total displacement, with a compression ratio of 6.65:1. The valvetrain has <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>camshafts</b> per bank of cylinders and four valves per cylinder.|$|R
