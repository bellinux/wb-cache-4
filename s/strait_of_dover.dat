5|$|Starting in November, the I Squadronless the Wittelsbach-class ships, {{which were}} still {{occupied}} with trialsconducted {{a number of}} short cruises, culminating in the annual winter cruise that began on 1 December. The ships steamed into the Kattegat and stopped in Frederikshavn, Denmark, before continuing on to Bergen, where they stayed from 6 to 10 December. Kaiser Friedrich III {{and the rest of}} the squadron returned to Kiel, arriving two days later. On 2 April 1903, the squadron went to sea again, and began gunnery training two days later. These exercises continued for the rest of the month, interrupted only by heavy storms. A major training cruise followed the next month; on 10 May the ships departed the Elbe river and made their way into the Atlantic. They cruised south to Spain, passing Ushant on 14 May and reaching the Iberian Peninsula five days later. There, they conducted a reconnaissance exercise off Pontevedra before anchoring in Vigo on 20 May. Prince Heinrich left Kaiser Friedrich III for a visit to Madrid. After he returned, the squadron departed Spain on 30 May. The ships passed through the <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dover</b> on 3 June and continued into the Kattegat. There, they rendezvoused with the torpedo boats of the I Torpedobootsflotille (Torpedo Boat Flotilla)commanded by Korvettenkapitän (Lieutenant Commander) Franz von Hipperfor a mock attack on the fortifications at Kiel.|$|E

25|$|With Germany's {{occupation}} of the Pas-de-Calais region in Northern France, the possibility of closing the <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dover</b> to Royal Navy warships and merchant convoys {{by the use of}} land-based heavy artillery became readily apparent, both to the German High Command and to Hitler. Even the Kriegsmarines Naval Operations Office deemed this a plausible and desirable goal, especially given the relatively short distance, , between the French and English coasts. Orders were therefore issued to assemble and begin emplacing every Army and Navy heavy artillery piece available along the French coast, primarily at Pas-de-Calais. This work was assigned to the Organisation Todt and commenced on 22 July 1940.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dover</b> {{is thought}} to have been created around 200,000 years ago by a catastrophic GLOF caused by the {{breaching}} of the Weald-Artois Anticline, which acted as a natural dam that held back a large lake in the Doggerland region, now submerged under the North Sea. The flood would have lasted several months, releasing as much as one million cubic metres of water per second. The cause of the breach is not known but may have been caused by an earthquake or simply the build-up of water pressure in the lake. As well as destroying the isthmus that connected Britain to continental Europe, the flood carved a large bedrock-floored valley {{down the length of the}} English Channel, leaving behind streamlined islands and longitudinal erosional grooves characteristic of catastrophic megaflood events.|$|E

25|$|In 1806 {{at the age}} of 17, Cooper {{joined the}} crew of the {{merchant}} ship Sterling as a common sailor. At the time, the Sterling was commanded by young John Johnston from Maine. Cooper served as a common seaman before the mast. His first voyage took some 40 stormy days at sea and brought him to an English market in Cowes with a cargo of flour. There Cooper saw his first glimpses of England. The Sterling passed through the <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dover</b> and arrived at Cowes, where she dropped anchor. Britain {{was in the midst of}} war with Napoleon's France at the time, so their ship was immediately approached by a British man-of-war and was boarded by some of its crew. They seized one of the Sterling's best crew members and impressed him into the British Royal Navy.|$|E
25|$|Nothing further {{is heard}} of Crabbe until {{the spring of}} 1310, when he seized a ship {{carrying}} cloth, jewels, gold, silver and other goods worth £2000 which were the property of Alice of Hainault (d. 26 October 1317), Countess Marshal. As revealed in a letter of complaint from Edward II of England to Count Robert of Flanders dated 29 May 1310, the ship was in the <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dover,</b> bound for London, when it was attacked by Crabbe, then master of the De la Mue (i.e. of Mude or Muiden). Although the King sent further letters to the Count, Crabbe was not brought to justice. In 1315, some of Crabbe's men were punished, but no restitution had been made, in consequence of which Edward II ordered the seizure of Flemish ships and goods in London to compensate the Countess.|$|E

A Bf110 over Goodwood and a Do17 were shot down by 238 Squadron. The convoy reached the Isle of Wight at daybreak and Do17s escorted by around 50 Bf109s and Bf110s from III./JG 27 and V./LG 1 attacked the convoy south of the Needles, where 43 Squadron engaged the formation, shooting down a Bf109 and a Bf110 for one pilot killed; 238 Squadron claimed the Bf110 and the Dorniers failed to damage the ships. The only other daylight action was {{the destruction of a}} Do17 from 4.(F)/121 by Hurricanes of 145 Squadron and 23 July was quiet, a Ju88 from 4.(F)/121 being shot down by 242 Squadron near Yarmouth. A small convoy passed the strait on 24 July and was attacked by Do17s from KG 2. Spitfires from 54 Squadron intercepted the attack, no ships were hit and no aircraft were shot down. In the afternoon, StG 1 sank the Terlings and the Norwegian steamer Kollskegg.|$|E
25|$|Louis XIV's {{first act}} was an {{official}} recognition of Philip V's {{place in the}} French line of succession by proclaiming {{the doctrine of the}} divine right of kings. This gave rise to the spectre of France and Spain uniting under a single monarch, a direct contradiction of Charles II's will. Next, in early February 1701 Louis XIV moved to secure the Bourbon succession in the Spanish Netherlands and sent French troops to take over the Dutch-held 'Barrier' fortresses that William III had secured at the Peace of Ryswick. The Spanish Netherlands were of vital strategic interest to the Dutch as they acted as a buffer zone between France and the Republic. But the French incursion was also detrimental to Dutch commercial interests in the region as there was now no prospect of keeping the Scheldt trade restrictions in place – restrictions that up till now had ensured the Republic's position as the primary inlet and outlet for European trade. England also had its own interests in the Spanish Netherlands, and ministers recognised the potential danger posed by an enemy established to the east of the <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dover</b> who, taking advantage of favourable wind and tide, could threaten the British Isles. The French move was designed in part to pressure the States General of the Netherlands into recognising Philip as King of Spain – which they soon did – but from William III's perspective, losing the hard-won securities overturned the work of the last twenty years.|$|E

40|$|We {{assess the}} {{capability}} of lead isotopes to study the transport of pollution aerosols above the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dover</b> by collecting atmospheric aerosols above the Eastern Channel and the Southern Bight of the North Sea. During the same period, we characterized the lead isotopic signature of the main industrial sources on the French coast near the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dover.</b> Urban and automobile-derived aerosols were also collected. Due to the phasing out of lead in gasoline, the urban isotopic composition (206 Pb/ 207 Pb= 1. 158 ± 0. 003) has become more radiogenic, although it is highly variable. On a regional scale, major industrial emissions have a well-defined isotopic composition (1. 13 < 206 Pb/ 207 Pb< 1. 22), more radiogenic than the petrol-lead signature (1. 06 < 206 Pb/ 207 Pb< 1. 12). These results together with those measured near the main coastal highway show that the automobile source has become a minor component of particulate lead in air. On a local scale, Dunkerque, the most urbanized and industrialized area along the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dover,</b> may transiently control elevated lead concentrations. Except for the occurrence of local and regional range transport episodes, lead concentrations in the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dover</b> {{can be related to}} remote or semi-remote pollution source emissions. Combining air mass retrospective trajectories and related lead abundances and isotopic compositions, it can be shown that lead aerosols originating from eastern Europe have an isotopic signature (1. 145 < 206 Pb/ 207 Pb< 1. 169) different from the isotopic composition of west-European lead aerosols (1. 111 < 206 Pb/ 207 Pb< 1. 142). The influence of remote North American sources is suggested, with caution, due to uncertainties in meteorological calculations. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.
