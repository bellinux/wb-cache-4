5|$|Micro Machines is a {{top-down}} racing game: players observe races from above. Players race in environments such as {{breakfast and}} pool tables, work desks, and treehouses, driving toy vehicles such as powerboats, helicopters, formula one cars, and tanks that can shoot other racers. Courses have a predefined path that racers must follow: {{if a player}} leaves the defined route for too long they are {{sent back to the}} track. Many have obstacles such as cereal boxes on breakfast tables, and pencil <b>sharpeners</b> on desks.|$|E
500|$|David, who {{selected}} the stock, was uncompromising in {{her choice of}} merchandise; despite its large range of kitchen implements, the shop did not stock either wall-mounted knife <b>sharpeners</b> or garlic presses. David wrote an article called [...] "Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless", refused to sell them, and advised customers who demanded them to go elsewhere. Not available elsewhere, by contrast, were booklets by David printed specially for the shop. Some of them were later incorporated into the collections of her essays and articles, An Omelette and a Glass of Wine and Is There a Nutmeg in the House?

500|$|Hans Hendricksz Bouwer was {{the first}} to list [...] "dodos", most likely {{referring}} to the Rodrigues solitaire, as part of the fauna of Rodrigues in 1601. Sir Thomas Herbert mentioned [...] "dodos" [...] on Rodrigues again in 1634, and they were also mentioned in 1700. The next account, which {{was the first}} referring to the bird as the [...] "solitaire", was published in François Leguat's 1708 memoir, A New Voyage to the East Indies. Leguat was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees, who were the first to colonise the island from 1691 to 1693, after they were marooned there by their captain. His description of the Rodrigues solitaire and its behaviour is the most detailed account of the bird in life, and he also described other species that are now extinct. Leguat's observations are considered some of the first cohesive accounts of animal behaviour in the wild. He later left for Mauritius, but was too late to observe dodos there. The Huguenots praised the Rodrigues solitaires for their flavour, especially that of the young, and used their gizzard stones as knife <b>sharpeners.</b> D'Héguerty later claimed these were also useful in medicine, and referred to them as bezoars. The second most detailed description of the bird was found in an anonymous document rediscovered in 1874 called Relation de l'Ile Rodrigue, which has been attributed to Julien Tafforet, a mariner marooned on Rodrigues in 1726. His observations are considered credible, though it is known he had a copy of Leguat's memoirs with him during his stay.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Work Sharp {{released}} an upgraded model of their knife and tool <b>sharpener,</b> the Ken Onion Edition <b>sharpener.</b> Ken Onion, renowned knife maker, used the original Work Sharp Knife and Tool <b>sharpener</b> during a hunting trip in Alaska and had positive feedback for Work Sharp {{but had a}} few suggestions for improvements. Shortly after that conversation, Ken Onion and the engineers and Work Sharp began collaborating and produced the Ken Onion Edition <b>Sharpener.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Marc Brown's children, Tolon, Eliza and Tucker, are {{referenced}} in {{the show}} many times, {{just as they are}} in the Arthur book series. For example, the town's moving company is called [...] "Tolon Moving", and everyday items such as cups or pencil <b>sharpeners</b> have the word [...] "Eliza" [...] printed on them. References to Cookie Jar Entertainment and WGBH also appear often on the show. In one episode, Francine and Buster are shown playing a table hockey game in which one team's players wear shirts in the Montreal Canadiens' signature colours with Montreal-based Cinar's logo on them (Cinar was the predecessor to today's Cookie Jar Entertainment) and the other team's players wear shirts in the Boston Bruins' colors with Boston-based WGBH's sting logo on them. Subsequent episodes that involve hockey also depict players wearing these sweater designs. Also, in the episode [...] "The Big Blow-Up" [...] in Season 2, a racecar driver wears a jersey with [...] "Cinar" [...] written on it and a car with [...] "WGBH" [...] written on it. In the episode [...] "Prove It" [...] in Season 4, The Brain introduces D.W. to science while watching a non-animated episode of Nova, a science series also produced by WGBH. Brown's son Tolon, for whom Brown first invented the character of Arthur the Aardvark in a bedtime story, {{is the executive director of}} the show.|$|E
60|$|It was one {{of those}} queer little shops so {{constantly}} seen in the side streets of London, which must be called toy-shops only because toys upon the whole predominate; for the remainder of goods seem to consist of almost everything else in the world--tobacco, exercise-books, sweet-stuff, novelettes, halfpenny paper clips, halfpenny pencil <b>sharpeners,</b> bootlaces, and cheap fireworks. It also sold newspapers, and a row of dirty-looking posters hung along the front of it.|$|E
6000|$|With {{a view to}} abating {{somewhat}} {{the horrors}} of this recurring season of depravity, it has been proposed by several wise and decent Tamtonians to extend the term of office of the Tnediserp to six years instead of five, but the <b>sharpeners</b> of axes are too powerful to be overthrown. They have made the people believe that if the man whom the country chooses to rule it because it thinks him wise and good were permitted to rule it too long {{it would be impossible}} to displace him in punishment for his folly and wickedness. It is, indeed, far more likely that the term of office will be reduced to four years than extended to six. The effect can be no less than hideous! ...|$|E

Some models use replaceable shaving razor blades, while others have permanently-fitted blades. Linear blade <b>sharpeners</b> may require more skill, but they allow one to sharpen the tip of the pencil into any desired shape and angle of taper, whereas prism <b>sharpeners</b> have a fixed sharpening angle and produce circular symmetry.|$|E
