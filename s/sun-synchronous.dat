25|$|<b>Sun-synchronous</b> orbit: An orbit which {{combines}} altitude and inclination {{in such a}} way that the satellite passes over any given point of the planets' surface at the same local solar time. Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for imaging, spy, and weather satellites.|$|E
25|$|PSLV-C6 carried and {{deployed}} two Indian satellites, Cartosat-1 (a.k.a. IRS-P5) and HAMSAT {{into the}} <b>Sun-synchronous</b> orbit. Built by ISRO, Cartosat-1 was a stereoscopic remote sensing satellite and {{first of the}} Cartosat series of satellites. HAMSAT was a microsatellite, built for providing satellite based amateur radio satellite to the national {{as well as the}} international community of amateur radio operators (HAM).|$|E
25|$|PSLV-C6 was {{the sixth}} {{operational}} launch and overall ninth {{mission of the}} PSLV program. This launch was also the fifty-fourth launch by Indian Space Research Organisation since its first mission on 1 January 1962. The vehicle carried and injected India's two satellites; Cartosat-1 (a.k.a. IRS-P5) and HAMSAT into the <b>Sun-synchronous</b> orbit. PSLV-C6 was launched at 04:44 hours Coordinated Universal Time (10:14 hours Indian Standard Time) on 5 May 2005 from the second launch pad of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre.|$|E
25|$|Retrograde orbit: An orbit with an {{inclination}} of {{more than}} 90°. Or rather, an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet. Apart from those in <b>sun-synchronous</b> orbit, few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them {{is much greater than}} for a prograde orbit. This is because when the rocket starts out on the ground, it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitude.|$|E
25|$|PSLV-C5 was {{the fifth}} {{operational}} launch and overall eighth mission of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle program. This launch was also the fifty-second launch by the Indian Space Research Organisation (IRSO) since its first mission on 1 January 1962. The vehicle carried and injected India's remote sensing satellite Resourcesat-1 (also known as IRS-P6) into a <b>sun-synchronous</b> orbit; this was the heaviest and most sophisticated satellite built by IRSO through 2003. PSLV-C5 was launched at 04:52 hours Coordinated Universal Time (10:22 hours Indian Standard Time) on 17 October 2003 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre.|$|E
25|$|PSLV-C1 was {{the overall}} fourth {{mission of the}} PSLV program by Indian Space Research Organisation. The vehicle carried IRS-1D {{satellite}} which was deployed in the <b>Sun-synchronous</b> Low Earth orbit. This was India's first launch vehicle built without Russian assistance and PSLV's first operational flight placed IRS-1D into a polar orbit. However, it could not place the satellite in the desired circular orbit but in an elliptical orbit due to a leak of helium gas {{from one of the}} components. The mission was termed partial failure since the satellite could not be placed at the desired altitude.|$|E
25|$|Indian Remote Sensing {{satellites}} (IRS) are {{a series}} of earth observation satellites, built, launched and maintained by ISRO. The IRS series provides remote sensing services to the country. The Indian Remote Sensing Satellite system is the largest constellation of remote sensing satellites for civilian use in operation today in the world. All the satellites are placed in polar <b>Sun-synchronous</b> orbit and provide data in a variety of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions to enable several programmes to be undertaken relevant to national development. The initial versions are composed of the 1 (A, B, C, D) nomenclature. The later versions are named based on their area of application including OceanSat, CartoSat, ResourceSat.|$|E
500|$|Landsat 2 was {{originally}} set to launch on January 19, 1975, but an electrical {{problem with the}} launch vehicle caused the launch to be postponed. Landsat 2 was launched January 22, 1975 on a Delta 2910 out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The satellite {{was placed in a}} <b>sun-synchronous,</b> near-polar orbit with an inclination of 99.2 degrees and an altitude of [...] Landsat 2 orbited Earth every 103 minutes, totaling 14 times per day. The orbital cycle of the satellite was repeated every 18 days.|$|E
500|$|Landsat 2 is {{the second}} {{satellite}} of the Landsat program. The spacecraft originally carried a designation of ERTS-B (Earth Resource Technology Satellite B) but was renamed [...] "Landsat 2" [...] prior to its launch on January 22, 1975. The objective of the satellite was to acquire global, seasonal data in medium resolution from a near-polar, <b>sun-synchronous</b> orbit. The satellite, built by General Electric, acquired data with the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS). Despite having a design life of one year, Landsat 2 operated for over seven years, finally ceasing operations on February 25, 1982.|$|E
500|$|Svalbard Satellite Station (...) or SvalSat is a {{satellite}} ground station located on Platåberget near Longyearbyen in Svalbard, Norway. Opened in 1997, it is operated by Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), {{a joint venture}} between Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace and the Norwegian Space Centre (NSC). SvalSat and KSAT's Troll Satellite Station (TrollSat) in Antarctica are the only ground stations that can see a low altitude polar orbiting satellite (e.g., in <b>sun-synchronous</b> orbit) on every revolution as the earth rotates. The facility consists of 31 multi-mission and customer-dedicated antennas which operate in the C, L, S and X bands. The station provides ground services to more satellites than any other facility in the world.|$|E
500|$|Landsat 2 was {{manufactured}} by General Electric's Space Division in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. This satellite {{was considered an}} experiment, unlike Landsat 1. Landsat 2 was originally designated as ERTS-B (Earth Resources Technology Satellite-B) and was renamed prior to launch. The satellite was designed to operate {{for a minimum of}} one year. The primary objective of the MSS was to acquire global, seasonal data in medium resolution from a near-polar, <b>sun-synchronous</b> orbit. NASA administrator James C. Fletcher said, [...] "If I had to pick one spacecraft, one space age development to save the world, I would pick ERTS and the satellites which I believe will be evolved from it later in this decade." ...|$|E
500|$|PSLV-C37 was {{launched}} from the First Launch Pad of Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota at 09:28 IST on 15 February 2017.
