40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel framework for training models to recognise simple spatial-motion events, {{such as those}} described by the verbs pick up, put down, push, pull, drop, tip, and tap and classifying novel observations into previously trained classes. Simple colour- and motionbased segmentation and tracking techniques are used to produce a time series of feature vectors constructed from the 2 D object positions, orientations, shapes, and sizes. Hidden Markov models are trained on this time series data and used to classify novel occurrences into previously trained classes. The particular choice of features used allows the system to construct meaningful semantic representations of the event classes that it has learned.

5000|$|On March 27, 2007, the Deseret Morning News {{reported}} that Jeffs had renounced {{his role as}} prophet of the FLDS Church {{in a conversation with}} his brother Nephi. Nephi quoted him as saying he was [...] "the greatest of all sinners" [...] and that God never called him to be a prophet. Jeffs and his defense team had no comment on the statement. Rumors suggest it was a lie from his brother Nephi, who was trying to usurp his brother's role, while more rumors circulated <b>saying</b> <b>Jeffs</b> must step down as prophet so a new man could perform marriages and continue adding wives to the men of the community. An unnamed source said that Jeffs retracted his statement to Nephi. However, the veracity of that source was called into question when Jeffs presented a handwritten note to the judge at the end of trial on March 27 saying that he was not a prophet of the FLDS Church.|$|R

60|$|Mat, I {{am quite}} {{glad to hear}} that you are not hurried and fretted with work from New York this spring--I am sure I should think Sis and housekeeping, etc., would be enough to attend to. I was real amused with Sis's remarks, and all that was in the letter about her. You must none of you notice her smartness, nor criticisms, before her, nor {{encourage}} her to spread herself nor be critical, as it is not good to encourage a child to be too sharp--and I hope Sissy {{is going to be a}} splendid specimen of good animal health. For the few years to come I should think more of that than anything--that is the foundation of all (righteousness included); as to her mental vivacity and growth, they are plenty enough of themselves, and will get along quite fast enough of themselves, plenty fast enough--don't stimulate them at all. Dear little creature, how I should like to see her this minute. Jeff must not make his lessons to her in music anyways strong or frequent on any account--two lessons a week, of ten minutes each, is enough--but then I dare <b>say</b> <b>Jeff</b> will think of all these things, just the same as I am <b>saying.</b> <b>Jeff</b> writes he wonders if I am as well and hearty, and I suppose he means as much of a beauty as ever, whether I look the same. Well, not only as much but more so--I believe I weigh about 200, and as to my face, (so scarlet,) and my beard and neck, they are terrible to behold. I fancy the reason I am able to do some good in the hospitals among the poor languishing and wounded boys, is, that I am so large and well--indeed like a great wild buffalo, with much hair. Many of the soldiers are from the West, and far North, and they take to a man that has not the bleached shiny and shaved cut of the cities and the East. I spent three to four hours yesterday in Armory hospital. One of my particular boys there was dying--pneumonia--he wanted me to stop with him awhile; he could not articulate--but the look of his eyes, and the holding on of his hand was deeply affecting. His case is a relapse--eight days ago he had recovered, was up, was perhaps a little careless--at any rate took cold, was taken down again and has sank rapidly. He has no friends or relatives here. Yesterday he labored and panted so for breath, it was terrible. He is a young man from New England, from the country. I expected to see his cot vacated this afternoon or evening, as I shall go down then. Mother, if you or Mat was here a couple of days, you would cry your eyes out. I find I have to restrain myself and keep my composure--I succeed pretty well. Good-bye, dearest mother.|$|R
