25|$|Dozens {{of species}} of fish {{have been found in}} the middens. Some of the most common are pike, whitefish, cod and ling at Østenkaer, anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and eel at Krabbesholm. The oldest site, Yderhede, {{featured}} remains of flatfish and sharks: porbeagle, topeshark, smoothhound and at Lystrup Enge <b>spurdog.</b> At Egsminde herring, cyprinids and European perch were found. The presence of deep-sea fish and sharks probably indicates the Ertebølle fishermen often ventured out on deep water. Whether they did so in their marshland dugouts or also owned larger, ocean-going ones is an answer that waits for more evidence.|$|E
500|$|The {{growth rate}} of the velvet belly is slow, though faster than some other deep-sea sharks, such as the leafscale gulper shark (Centrophorus squamosus) or the shortspine <b>spurdog</b> (Squalus mitsukurii). Males mature sexually at [...] long and females at [...] long. The average age at {{maturity}} is 4.0 years for males and 4.7 years for females, though four-year-old mature individuals of both sexes have {{been caught in the}} wild, along with immature females over eight years old. Males and females eight and 11 years old, respectively, have been caught in the wild; the potential lifespan of this species has been estimated at 18 years for males and 22 years for females.|$|E
2500|$|Like other skates, {{the common}} skate is a bottom feeder. Its diet {{consists}} of crustaceans, clams, oysters, snails, bristle worms, cephalopods, and small to medium-sized fish (such as sand eel, flatfish, monkfish, catsharks, <b>spurdog,</b> other skates). The {{size of the}} individual can affect its diet. Larger ones eat larger things like fish. The bigger the skate is the more food that {{will be needed to}} sustain its large body size. The activity level determines how much it eats; the more active it is the more it eats. [...] The common skate does not only feed on creatures {{at the bottom of the}} ocean, as some do ascend to feed on mackerel, herring, and other pelagic fish, which are caught by rapidly moving up from the seabed to grab the prey.|$|E
50|$|Small {{numbers of}} bighead <b>spurdogs</b> are caught {{incidentally}} by longliners fishing for ruby snapper (Etelis carbunculus) south of New Caledonia. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient data {{to assess the}} conservation status of this species.|$|R
50|$|Squalus is a genus of {{dogfish sharks}} {{in the family}} Squalidae. Commonly known as <b>spurdogs,</b> these sharks are {{characterized}} by smooth dorsal fin spines, teeth in upper and lower jaws similar in size, caudal peduncle with lateral keels; upper precaudal pit usually present, and caudal fin without subterminal notch. In <b>spurdogs,</b> the hyomandibula (the bone connecting the braincase to the jaws) is oriented at a right angle to the neurocranium, while in other sharks, the hyomandibula runs more parallel to the body. This led some {{to think that the}} upper jaw of Squalus would not be as protractile as the jaws of other sharks. However, a study that compared different jaw suspension types in sharks showed {{that this is not the}} case and that Squalus is quite capable of protruding its upper jaw during feeding.|$|R
40|$|In age {{and growth}} studies, many species seem {{to follow a}} {{different}} growth trajectory than the traditionally applied von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM). To test a methodology for improving growth modeling in poorly studied chondrichthyans, 568 longnose <b>spurdogs</b> of Mediterranean origin were aged. A set of seven growth models were fitted to the obtained age-length data. Comparisons in growth model accuracy based on the Akaike Information Criterion allowed {{the assessment of the}} best model. In the case that no model fitted the data correctly, a multi-model inference (MMI) was carried out based on model averaging. The results provided evidence that the growth parameters inferred with the VBGM should be used with caution. JRC. G. 3 -Maritime affair...|$|R
50|$|The Philippines <b>spurdog</b> (Squalus montalbani), {{also known}} as the Indonesian greeneye <b>spurdog</b> is a {{relatively}} large species of dogfish shark native to waters off the coast of Australia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The species was identified in 1912 from a specimen caught off the coast of Luzon Island, and has been both bycatch and a targeted species in fisheries since. Its taxonomy is complex, having been renamed in 1931, being misidentified as a type of shortspine <b>spurdog,</b> then being revived as a species in 2007.|$|E

50|$|The blacktailed <b>spurdog</b> {{has been}} seldom studied for parasites.

50|$|The first {{specimens}} of the bighead <b>spurdog</b> were collected during South Pacific biodiversity surveys {{conducted by the}} Institut de recherche pour le développement (IRD). The species was described by Peter Last, Bernard Séret, and John Pogonoski in a 2007 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) publication. The specific name bucephalus {{is derived from the}} Latin bu ("large") and the Greek kephalis ("of the head"). Of the four original specimens, a 56 cm long immature male caught over Norfolk Ridge was selected as the holotype. Morphologically, this species belongs to a subgroup of Squalus defined by the shortnose <b>spurdog</b> (S. megalops) and the Cuban dogfish (S. cubensis).|$|E
50|$|The blacktailed <b>spurdog,</b> Squalus melanurus, is a dogfish, {{a member}} of the family Squalidae, found around New Caledonia in the central Pacific Ocean, at depths from 320 to 320 m. Its length is up to 75 cm.|$|E
50|$|The bighead <b>spurdog</b> {{has only}} been {{recorded}} from the waters south of New Caledonia, and from seamounts on the Norfolk Ridge in the northern Tasman Sea. It has been caught between the depths of 448 - 800 m.|$|E
