40|$|IntroductionAscending aortic {{pathology}} {{presents a}} unique challenge for treatment by thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), {{because of lack}} of adequate endograft landing zones. This report describes a unique “reverse” extra-anatomical aortic arch debranching procedure performed to enable TEVAR of the ascending aorta. ReportA 71 -year-old male presented with a large ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm secondary to previous arch repair anastomosis. This pathology was treated by TEVAR of the ascending aorta. To create a <b>sufficient</b> <b>landing</b> zone for the endovascular stent graft, a “reverse” extra-anatomical aortic arch debranching procedure was performed. This involved a left subclavian artery to left carotid artery bypass, left to right carotid-to-carotid bypass, ligation of proximal left common carotid artery, and embolization of the innominate artery origin. DiscussionTEVAR of the ascending aorta can be made feasible through a novel debranching procedure that creates <b>sufficient</b> <b>landing</b> zones for the endograft. This surgical approach may prove useful in patients who present with aortic arch pathology and comorbidities that prevent open surgical repair...|$|R

25|$|The answer, he said, would largely {{depend on}} the way in which {{sovereignty}} was said to have been acquired. He observed that although the legal authorities claimed that sovereignty over Australia was acquired by occupation, the country was not vacant, but already occupied; nor had it been conquered or ceded under a treaty. Rather, Judge Willis said, sovereignty was actually acquired under the principle expounded by Vattel in his The Law of Nations, referred to by both the prosecution and the defence, that a 'civilised' people may take possession of territory occupied by 'uncivilised' people, provided they leave for them <b>sufficient</b> <b>land</b> for their sustenance.|$|E

25|$|Food access {{refers to}} the {{affordability}} and allocation of food, {{as well as the}} preferences of individuals and households. The UN Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights noted that the causes of hunger and malnutrition are often not a scarcity of food but an inability to access available food, usually due to poverty. Poverty can limit access to food, and can also increase how vulnerable an individual or household is to food price spikes. Access depends on whether the household has enough income to purchase food at prevailing prices or has <b>sufficient</b> <b>land</b> and other resources to grow its own food. Households with enough resources can overcome unstable harvests and local food shortages and maintain their access to food.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, a Land Commission was {{appointed}} {{to deal with the}} settlement of Africans on the land. The Commission recommended that two large territories be set aside for native occupation, the Shangani and Gwaai Reserves in Matabeleland, of about 2,486,000 acres. Before the arrival of the Europeans, Africans had held nearly 100,000,000 acres in what became Southern Rhodesia. The Land Commission's plan showed such poor judgment, and the bases of allocation were so ill-considered, that the attempt to confine the native population within these two areas was never really practicable. Failure to make suitable provision for African lands may {{have been one of the}} prime causes of the Matabele and Mashona rebellions of 1896. Following these rebellions, BSAC was required to assign <b>sufficient</b> <b>land</b> to Southern Rhodesian Africans for their agricultural and pastoral requirements, including access to sufficient water. Native Reserves were set up under this directive, which by 1902 had an estimated indigenous population of 530,000. Although later modifications were made, the basic pattern of land allocation persisted until independence. The European district officers who responsible for defining the reserves were advised to allow between 9 and 15 acres of arable land for each family, and adequate pasture, but they had little geographic knowledge of the country and no maps. In 1910, a Native Affairs Committee of Enquiry was set up, which made very few changes. The Committee's land apportionment was 19 million acres for Europeans and 21.4 million acres for Native Reserves with an African population of about 700,000. A further 51.6 million acres was unassigned, but available for future alienation to Europeans.|$|E

Initially, Dalgety remained at the forefront, but by the eighth round Yass-Canberra had emerged as a new leader, and the site was confirmed in the ninth round of voting.

500|$|With the {{validity}} of the agreement in question, the tribes, joined by the Indian Rights Association (IRA) and local ranchers, lobbied against its ratification by Congress. [...] The IRA wrote letters to Senators, stating that the agreement was: [...] "utterly destructive of that honor and good faith which should characterize our dealings with any people, and especially with one too weak to enforce their rights as against us by any other mean as than an appeal to our sense of justice." [...] The Secretary of the Interior informed Congress that the allotment would be devastating to the tribes, as the land was not suited to farming, and the amount of land allotted would not allow them <b>sufficient</b> <b>land</b> to graze cattle. [...] A bill was introduced in 1892 to ratify the agreement, but failed to receive the necessary votes. [...] It was reintroduced every year until it passed in 1900, eight years later.

2500|$|Slow {{sand filters}} {{may be used}} where there is <b>sufficient</b> <b>land</b> and space, as the water must be passed very slowly through the filters. These filters rely on {{biological}} treatment processes for their action rather than physical filtration. The filters are carefully constructed using graded layers of sand, with the coarsest sand, along with some gravel, {{at the bottom and}} finest sand at the top. Drains at the base convey treated water away for disinfection. Filtration depends on the development of a thin biological layer, called the zoogleal layer or Schmutzdecke, {{on the surface of the}} filter. An effective slow sand filter may remain in service for many weeks or even months if the pretreatment is well designed and produces water with a very low available nutrient level which physical methods of treatment rarely achieve. Very low nutrient levels allow water to be safely sent through distribution systems with very low disinfectant levels, thereby reducing consumer irritation over offensive levels of chlorine and chlorine by-products. Slow sand filters are not backwashed; they are maintained by having the top layer of sand scraped off when flow is eventually obstructed by biological growth.|$|E

25|$|As English law {{applied in}} both in Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia, all land {{that had not}} already been alienated should in {{principle}} have been Crown land.

It also claimed the right to alienate this land as its owner. In 1890 and 1891, the Colonial Office and the High Commissioner accepted that BSAC had obtained title to the land in Mashonaland. After the Matebele wars, the company also claimed in 1894 {{to have the right}} to dispose of all land in Matebeleland, on the basis that the Ndebele king, Lobengula had owned it, but had forfeited it.
