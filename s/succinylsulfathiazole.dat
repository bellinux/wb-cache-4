50|$|<b>Succinylsulfathiazole</b> is a sulfonamide. It is also spelled as succinylsulphathiazole. It is a {{white or}} yellow-white {{crystalline}} powder. It dissolves in aqueous solutions of alkali hydroxides and carbonates but is very slightly soluble in water.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other {{surgeries}} for anal incontinence, {{a preliminary}} colostomy {{is not necessary}} for Warren operation. The surgery is planned {{in such a way}} that it takes place 2-3 days after the cessation of menstrual flow, such that there is ample time for the surgical wound to heal until the next menses. <b>Succinylsulfathiazole</b> is the recommended intestinal antiseptic given two days before the surgery since it keeps the stool soft in the post-operative period. Enema is given early on the day of surgery.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} N 4 dicarboxylic acid-substituted {{sulfonamides}} which resists absorp-tion from the gastrointestinal tract {{was found to}} produce varying degrees of intestinal bacteriostasis (1). Toxicological studies of <b>succinylsulfathiazole,</b> one of this series, have been described previously (2). Another compound in this group, 2 -(N 4 -phthalyl-sulfanilamido) -thiazole (phthalylsulfathiazole) 2 has re-cently engaged our attention. Preliminary reports (3, 4) indathd that this compound exerts a marked bacteriostatic effect on the intestinal coliform or-ganisms of dogs, and that smaller doses are required to produce this effect than are necessary with <b>succinylsulfathiazole.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|NIELSEN and Elvehjem and Martin have {{demonstrated}} the counteracting effect of folic acid concentrates on growth inhibition of rats due to <b>succinylsulfathiazole</b> and sulfaguanidine. These findings, indicating synthesis of folic acid by the intestinal bacteria, are {{in accord with the}} findings of Mitchell and Isbell on synthesis of this substance by rat intestinal flora...|$|E
40|$|Same new -complexes of {{the types}} MLCh (where M = Cu(II) or Hg(II) and L = sulfamethazine (SZ) or <b>succinylsulfathiazole</b> (SST) and ML 2 Ch [where M = Cu(lI) or Hg(II) and L = {{phthalylsulfathiazole}} (PST) have been synthesized and their structures investigated by analyses, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibility, UV-visible and IR spectral measurements. Molar eonductivities of the complexes indicate their non-electrolytic behaviour. Electronic, infrared and far IR-spectral studies suggest octahedral geometry for copper(II) complexes and tetrahedral geometry for mercury(II) complexes...|$|E
40|$|Alteration in {{the vitamin}} {{requirements}} of the white rat results from the feeding of highly insoluble sulfonamides-sulfaguanidine or <b>succinylsulfathiazole</b> (sulfasuxidine) -incorporated into specific purified die-ts. " 7 The animals develop a leukopenia and granulpcytopenia, with marrow studies revealing decreased numbers of cells of the myeloid series, particularly the adult polymorphonudear cells. Welch and Wnrght 9 attributed these hematopoietic changes to an alteration in the bacterial flora of the lower intestinal tract whereby the coliform bacteria are greatly reduced in number. According to Hogan and Parrott 5 this creates in the rat an exogenous requirement for some component of a preparation containing "folic acid. " Associated with {{the reduction in the}} number of coliform bacteria, a quantitative diminution in "folic acid " has been demonstrated by Topley, Krebl, and Elvehjem 8 in the cecal contents of rats on highly purified diets containing 4 per cent <b>succinylsulfathiazole.</b> Crystalline "folic acid " will overcome in rats the experimental leukopenia and granulocytopenia resulting from treatment with insoluble sulfonamides. 2 Recently, Zondek and Bromberg" 0 described another leukopoietic agent, viz., methyl acetamide with para-chloro-xylenol which evidently acts by direct stimulation of the granulopoietic function of the bone marrow. With this indirect method of producing neutropenia through the use of purified diets containing insoluble sulfonamides, and the well-known effect of the subcutaneous injection of benzol in olive-oil solution, 4 two contrasting ways of attaining a similar result are available. Two methods of stimulating granulocytosis also are possible: indirectly, through the oral administration of a preparation of liver extractt containing 20 to 40 micrograms of "folic acid" per gram, and directly, through the intramuscular injection of 2...|$|E
40|$|Pseudopolymorphs of two sulfonamide drugs, namely {{sulfathiazole}} and <b>succinylsulfathiazole,</b> {{have been}} prepared by recrystallization of the drugs from various organic solvents and their properties have been studied by several physicochemical methods. Thermal Analysis involving Thermal Gravimetry (TG) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) were used to investigate such thermal properties of the crystals as stabilities, desolvation processes and their kinetics {{as well as the}} melting of pure polymorphic forms of the drugs resulting from desolvation. Complementary studies of the compounds using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and DSC allowed identification and assignment of the products of desolvation i. e. polymorphs. Single crystal studies were carried out by X-ray diffraction methods. Interesting structural features such as crystal packing modes, hydrogen bonding schemes, cavity versus channel occupation by guest molecules and host conformations were investigated. From a high level of agreement of results obtained using these methods, the pseudopolymorphs and polymorphs studied were characterized unambiguously...|$|E
