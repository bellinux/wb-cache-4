40|$|Considering the {{importance}} of explaining how a nation brand is effectively managed and how nation branding aligns the nation's brand with country management so as to gain competitiveness, this research aims to assess the role of nation branding {{and to create a}} strategic management tool for nation branding to achieve <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness</b> of nations. Focusing on performance in nation branding, the dissertation develops a brand management model towards a systematic and strategic application for nation branding. Adopting a deductive approach based on a five-step plan for systematic research, the study proposes the Nation-Branding Mechanism Model as a mechanism-based process model. To provide empirical evidence a case study methodology is implemented involving two countries: the Republic of Korea and the Republic of Ireland. Longitudinally, the research investigates contextual variables of the nation branding process and their dynamics in branding Korea and Ireland by analyzing the "Export, Science, Technology and Industry"-brand system of Korea and the "FDI, Industry, Enterprise and Knowledge"- brand system of Ireland. The study identifies the nation-specific branding mechanisms within their nation-brand systems and the similarities and differences in both nation branding processes. An important finding is that nation branding is a process that must align with country management to influence the <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness</b> of a nation and that needs a systematic approach to building a nation brand. The mechanism-based process structures a set of activities carried out by branding actors. Moreover, nation branding is an ongoing and iterative process to develop a nation-brand system and to influence a nation's <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness.</b> This research suggests the ‘Nation-Branding Mechanism Model’ as an effective model for explaining performance in nation branding. Through its development, this study contributes to building a body of knowledge concerning the role of nation branding as a strategic management tool for achieving <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness</b> of nations...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, around the world, {{the concept of}} {{competitiveness}} was long debated by economists (and others), widely used and even sometimes overused. Although at the theoretical level, a number of determinant factors of health care organizations’ competitiveness have been proposed, their diversity and the little empirical data available argues for the need to create and validate a model of competitiveness of health organizations. The {{purpose of this paper}} is (considering the theoretical approach) to shape a model of <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness</b> of health organizations. In this respect, a 51 item questionnaire was designed and applied on a sample of 291 respondents from 12 Romanian health organizations. The exploratory factor analysis undertaken recovered more than 69 % of the common variability of the initial 51 variables and revealed four factors/dimensions of <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness</b> of health organizations (Economic Dimension, Quality Dimension, Social Dimension, and Strategic Dimension). Among the results of the exploratory factor analysis is also the empirical evidence on the contribution of leadership and managerial processes to enhance the influence of all other factors/dimensions in increasing the <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness</b> of health organizations, thus bringing into focus the concept of sustainable management and leadership.

This article reviews {{a case study of}} the World Port Days in Rotterdam in order to demonstrate how annual city festivals can contribute to <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness,</b> despite limitations as well.

The direct value of the event for business in terms of sales and recruitment is limited, while the long-term effects of educational function deserve further attention. Finally, we provide policy lessons that, when properly contextualized, other cities may help to use annual local festivals as tools for <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the nature of}} the underlying concept of integrating knowledge management and ICT in urban management towards <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness.</b> The consistent and rapid growth of the Malaysian economy since the 60 s has undoubtedly resulted in an increase in the urban growth in Malaysia. The question that arises is, whether this growth is sustainable or not? Local authorities are responsible for the urban planning as well as making sure it is also sustainable. Thus, this paper will explore the potential of the implementation of knowledge management system as a tool in local authorities to manage urban growth. According to Garry L. Adam and Bruce T. Lamont (2003), knowledge management system (KMS) is a networked system that share information and leverage knowledge throughout the enterprise. In this case, enterprise refers to the local authorities. This model consists of five key elements; contents, technology, people, process and context that are related to each other and needed for the development of knowledge management systems. It will be used to help organizations to develop knowledge management systems more effectively that support all activities. KMS is a model that can {{play a role in the}} development and maintenance of <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness</b> advantage over time. <b>Sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness</b> is an ability to consistently maintain the surrounding environment and while the city continuous to grow. Sustainable means the involvement the people, facilities, environment and governance within the city. Thus, this paper will also highlight the role, tools and techniques of KMS which might assist local authorities.

40|$|Structural (SC) {{capital is}} part of the {{intellectual}} capital that is owned by an organisation and its efficient and dedicated management is essential for the creation of shareholder value, sustainable competitive advantage, and prolonged first-mover advantage. SC consists of three types of capital, namely: innovation, organisational and process capital. Organisational capital consists of organisational culture, management philosophies etc. and has received a large amount of management attention. However, organisational capital is not as valuable towards the creation of <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness</b> and first-mover advantage as innovation and process capital are. It is {{the purpose of this article}} to demonstrate how a thorough understanding and the efficient management of innovation and process capital enables organisations to achieve the afore-mentioned benefits. Innovation capital management consists primarily of patent and brand management, which are particularly important as patent management forms a high-margin justification for the implementation of organisation-wide intellectual property management, and the management of high-equity brands secures a loyal customer base and associative <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness</b> and first-mover advantage benefits. Although not as obviously valuable as innovation capital, the article also explores the value that the efficient management of unique organisational processes and methodologies contribute towards the achievement of prolonged first-mover advantage and the provision of protection against competitor actions. This exploration involved an examination of contemporary literature, theories and business cases and subsequently revealed that SCM is a vital discipline/philosophy that must be implemented by any organisation wishing to achieve greater <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitiveness.</b> Innovation and process capital are of particular importance as these assets can be made tangible, leveraged and integrated into existing business operations to create unique, inimitable and sustainable competitive advantage. </span...|$|E
