The objectives {{of this study were}} to test the use of rhizobia inoculation as an alternative N source for <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> production under rain fed conditions, and to identify suitable cultivars and appropriate agro-ecology for high pod yield and N 2 fixation in Ethiopia.

40|$|<b>Snap</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{production}} by large scale commercial producers in Ethiopia is under intensive production and relies on {{high rates of}} nitrogen (N) fertilizer and irrigation during the dry season. Despite increasing interest to produce this crop, small scale farmers cannot afford {{the high cost of}} N fertilizer. Field and greenhouse experiments were conducted to test <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> production under a low input production system better suited to small scale resource limited farmers. Field experiments were conducted in 2011 and 2012 under rain fed conditions, and in 2012 under irrigation, at three locations (Debre Zeit, Hawassa, Ziway) representing different climate zones in Ethiopia. This experiment used three N treatments: 0 and 100 kg N ha- 1, and inoculation with Rhizobium etli [HB 429], and eight cultivars: Andante, Boston Contender Blue, Lomami, Melkassa 1, Melkassa 3, Paulista and Volta. The general objective of the field experiment was to determine the potential of <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> production under a low input production system using rhizobium inoculation as the nitrogen source, and use rain fed conditions. Results obtained indicated that rhizobial inoculation and applied inorganic N increased on average the marketable pod yield of <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> under rain fed conditions by 18 % and 43 %, respectively. Nodulation and subsequent N 2 fixation was not effective in improving yield or other traits of <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> pod under irrigation, although applied N increased marketable yield by 33 %. Melkassa 1 was the most suitable cultivar for a reduced input production system due to its successful nodulation characteristics, greatest N 2 fixation levels and consistently good performance across locations under rain fed conditions. Commercial cultivars possessed the best pod quality characteristics and they yielded better under irrigation. Cultivars interacted with locations to affect pod traits including total soluble solids and concentrations of protein, calcium, and potassium under rain fed conditions. <b>Snap</b> <b>bean</b> cultivrs produced at Debre Zeit and Hawassa were similar in marketable yield and several other traits particularly under rain fed conditions. Zinc (Zn) concentration in pods was greatest at Hawassa both under rain fed and irrigated conditions. Conditions at Debre Zeit were the most conducive for supporting biological N 2 fixation for <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> production. The eight cultivars were also used for a greenhouse study that was evaluated treatments of drought stress of 50 % field capacity (50 % FC) during the vegetative (V 4. 4), flowering (R 6) and pod formation (R 7) developmental stages. Our result showed that drought stresses during reproductive stages (R 6 and R 7) were the most sensitive stages in deteriorating the quality of <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> pods. Drought stress increased protein, phosphorus and Zn concentrations but it reduced iron concentration in <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> pods. All cultivars had a similar response to drought stress. A second greenhouse experiment was conducted to test foliar application of growth regulators: the control, 10 - 5 M and 10 - 4 M concentrations of each of abscisic acid (ABA), kinetin and salicylic acid (SA); and two concentrations of yeast extract (4 g l- 1 and 8 g l- 1), under drought (50 % FC) stressed and unstressed conditions. Foliar application of SA on <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> under greenhouse conditions reduced the impact of drought stress, particularly the pod quality parameters: marketable yield, pod curving, texture and appearance of <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> pods. However, application of ABA, kinetin and SA reduced pod quality of <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> under unstressed conditions. In conclusion, pod yield improvement could be achieved by a N 2 fixation system under rain fed conditions, which is more sustainable than N fertilizer inputs. Pod quality was also adequate for commercial export production. Rhizobium inoculant can therefore be used as an alternative N source, particularly under low input production system for resource-limited small-scale <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> producers...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cultivar}} and planting season on growth development and pod yield of <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were analysed in a 2 -year, 2 -location experiment in Spain. Phenology, pod production, and quality differed significantly among <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars. Planting season {{had a significant}} effect on most pod traits except the number of seeds per pod, length, thickness, soluble solids content, tenderness, and string, and this effect varied markedly among environments. High and negative correlations for vegetative growth traits between early and late planting seasons confirmed the strong planting season influence on those traits. Fresh pod yields were highest in the early planting season, and the longer pod maturation phase could be considered {{to be one of the}} main factors. Planting of <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> earlier in the season should thus contribute to a longer growing vegetative cycle and greater productivity than normal or summer and late autumn planting. The earliest maturing <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars would have the highest fresh pod yields in late planting seasons, while the latest maturing <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars would have the highest yields in early and normal planting seasons. These results will allow breeders to optimise the level of earliness for each planting season without reducing the yield. This is a key requirement for <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> crops, and it is the first step towards selecting parental lines with stability of pod traits to be used in breeding programs for different growing areas and planting seasons.
