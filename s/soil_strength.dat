40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent years, {{geotechnical}} {{engineers have}} {{paid much attention}} on reliability-based design. The probability density functions (PDFs) of the uncertain soil parameters are required for the reliability-based design. Once these PDFs are obtained, reliability analysis can be conducted, and reliability-based design can be achieved. Among the <b>soil</b> parameters, <b>soil</b> <b>strengths</b> play important roles in geotechnical design, e. g. friction angle of sand and undrained shear strength of clay. It {{is essential to obtain}} the PDFs of the <b>soil</b> <b>strengths</b> to facilitate reliability-based design. How to obtain those PDFs based on all available information is an important research subject. It is possible to establish the PDFs of the <b>soil</b> <b>strengths</b> based on results from sophisticated laboratory tests, e. g. drained test for sand to obtain its friction angle, but those tests may be expensive and time consuming. On the other hand, some in-situ and laboratory tests are quick and convenient, but they usually do not provide direct information on the <b>soil</b> <b>strengths.</b> Nevertheless, they do usually provide indirect information of the <b>soil</b> <b>strengths</b> by correlation, e. g. SPT-N is positively correlated to friction angle of sand, and overconsolidation ratio (OCR) is also related to undrained shear strength of clay. Therefore, it is possible to update the PDFs of the <b>soil</b> <b>strengths</b> by using the in-situ and laboratory test data. ...|$|R

25|$|Dr. Robert Bea, {{chair of}} an {{independent}} levee investigation team, {{has said that the}} New Orleans-based design firm Modjeski and Masters could have followed correct procedures in calculating safety factors for the flood walls. He added, however, that design procedures of the Corps may not account for changes in <b>soil</b> <b>strength</b> caused by the changes in water flow and pressure during a hurricane flood. Dr. Bea has also questioned the size of the design safety margins. He said the corps applied a 30%margin over the maximum design load. A doubling of strength would be a more typical margin for highway bridges, dams, off-shore oil platforms and other public structures. There were also indications that substandard concrete may have been used at the 17th Street Canal.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the mechanical and electronic cones, {{a variety of other}} CPT-deployed tools have been developed over the years to provide additional subsurface information. One common tool advanced during CPT testing is a geophone set to gather seismic shear wave and compression wave velocities. This data helps determine the shear modulus and Poisson's ratio at intervals through the soil column for soil liquefaction analysis and low-strain <b>soil</b> <b>strength</b> analysis. Engineers use the shear wave velocity and shear modulus to determine the soil's behavior under low-strain and vibratory loads. Additional tools such as laser-induced fluorescence, X-ray fluorescence, soil conductivity/resistivity, pH, temperature and membrane interface probe and cameras for capturing video imagery are also increasingly advanced in conjunction with the CPT probe.|$|E
2500|$|The {{engineers}} {{responsible for}} the design of the canal levees and the I-walls embedded in them overestimated the <b>soil</b> <b>strength,</b> meaning that the <b>soil</b> <b>strength</b> used in the design calculations was greater than what actually existed under and near the levee during Hurricane Katrina. [...] They made unconservative (i.e., erring toward unsafe) interpretations of the data: the soil below the levee was actually weaker than that used in the I-wall design (ASCE: External Review Panel, pg 48). [...] Another critical engineering oversight that led to the failure of the 17th Street Canal involves not taking into account the possibility of a water-filled gap {{which turned out to be}} a very important aspect of the failures of the I-walls around New Orleans. [...] “Analysis indicate that, with the presence of a water-filled gap, the factor of safety is about 30 percent lower. [...] Because a factor of safety of 1.3 was used for design, a reduction of 30 percent would reduce the factor of safety to approximately one: a condition of incipient failure.” (ASCE: External Review Panel, pg 51) This meant that the design included a safety factor of 30% ("1.3"), and could cope in theory with stresses 30% more than expected, but the error due to the water gap was about 30%, which immediately used up the entire safety margin, leaving no leeway in the design if any other excess stress occurred.|$|E

30|$|Over the years, {{many studies}} have been {{conducted}} to quantify the contribution of root reinforcement to <b>soil</b> shear <b>strength.</b> These studies include in situ direct shear tests on soil blocks with plant roots (e.g. [3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and laboratory direct shear tests of soils with roots (e.g. [4, 13, 14] or soils reinforced by fibres that simulate roots (e.g. [15, 16, 17, 18]. These studies together give evidence on the increase in <b>soil</b> shear <b>strength</b> due to root reinforcement.

2500|$|The {{main purpose}} of the test is to provide an {{indication}} of the relative density of granular deposits, such as sands and gravels from which {{it is virtually impossible to}} obtain undisturbed samples. [...] The great merit of the test, and the main reason for its widespread use is that it is simple and inexpensive. The <b>soil</b> <b>strength</b> parameters which can be inferred are approximate, but may give a useful guide in ground conditions where it may not be possible to obtain borehole samples of adequate quality like gravels, sands, silts, clay containing sand or gravel and weak rock. In conditions where the quality of the undisturbed sample is suspect, e.g., very silty or very sandy clays, or hard clays, it is often advantageous to alternate the sampling with standard penetration tests to check the strength. If the samples are found to be unacceptably disturbed, it may be necessary to use a different method for measuring strength like the plate test. [...] When the test is carried out in granular soils below groundwater level, the soil may become loosened. In certain circumstances, it can be useful to continue driving the sampler beyond the distance specified, adding further drilling rods as necessary. Although this is not a standard penetration test, and should not be regarded as such, it may at least give an indication as to whether the deposit is really as loose as the standard test may indicate.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{variation}} of <b>soil</b> shear <b>strength</b> parameters with depth on slope stability considering spatial variability of soil parameters has not been studied systematically. A probabilistic method is proposed for infinite slope stability analysis considering the variation of <b>soil</b> shear <b>strength</b> parameters with depth. First, the Karhunen-Loeve expansion is adopted to simulate the random field of spatially varying soils. Second, the effect of spatial variability of soil parameters on failure probability and critical slip surfaces is investigated. Finally, an infinite slope is presented {{to demonstrate the validity}} and capacity of the proposed method. The results indicate that the spatial variability of <b>soil</b> shear <b>strength</b> parameters has a significant influence on the failure probability of the infinite soil slope. The failure probability decreases with the increasing correlation length of <b>soil</b> shear <b>strength</b> parameters. For an undrained clay slope, a significant change in the undrained shear strength parameter varying with depth results in a smaller failure probability. Most of the critical slip surfaces will occur {{at the base of the}} slope. For a frictional/cohesive slope, the failure probability does not monotonically decrease with the increase of the variation of the <b>soil</b> shear <b>strength</b> parameters with depth.

Foreword Mudslide is a common geological disaster. China, with complex geological environment and concentrate precipitation, which result into frequent mudslide, suffers a great threaten to its people's lives and property safety. Mudslide, in essence, is the soil shear failure.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the mobilization of}} reinforcement tension within geosynthetic-reinforced soil (GRS) structures at working stress and at large soil strains. Fully-mobilized reinforcement tension is assumed in most current design methods for the internal stability of GRS structures.

However, comparison with reinforcement tension loads measured in the field has shown that this approach is conservative (excessively safe) by as much as a factor of two.
