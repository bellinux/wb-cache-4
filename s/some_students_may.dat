25|$|Since {{singing is}} a {{performing}} art, voice teachers spend {{some of their}} time preparing their students for performance. This includes teaching their students etiquette of behavior on stage such as bowing, addressing problems like stage fright or nervous tics, {{and the use of}} equipment such as microphones. <b>Some</b> <b>students</b> <b>may</b> also be preparing for careers in the fields of opera or musical theater where acting skills are required. Many voice instructors will spend time on acting techniques and audience communication with students in these fields of interest. Students of opera also {{spend a great deal of}} time with their voice teachers learning foreign language pronunciations.|$|E

25|$|A written {{document}} that addresses a student's specific individual needs. It may specify accommodations, materials, or classroom instruction. IEPs are often created {{for students with}} disabilities, who are {{required by law to}} have an IEP when appropriate. Most states are not required to have IEPs for students who are only identified as gifted. <b>Some</b> <b>students</b> <b>may</b> be intellectually gifted in addition to having learning and/or attentional disabilities, and may have an IEP that includes, for instance, enrichment activities as a means of alleviating boredom or frustration, or as a reward for on-task behavior. In order to warrant such an IEP, a student needs to be diagnosed with a separate emotional or learning disability that is not simply the result of being unchallenged in a typical classroom. These are also known as Individual Program Plans, or IPPs.|$|E

2500|$|For many parents, the {{decision}} {{of whether or not}} to enroll students into school-based speech therapy or privately practiced therapy is challenging. Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, <b>some</b> <b>students</b> <b>may</b> not be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, {{students are more likely to}} qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability.|$|E
2500|$|Although not a requirement, <b>some</b> <b>students</b> <b>may</b> {{submit their}} written reports (ranging from 15-25 pages) {{to the faculty}} {{committee}} {{in order to be}} considered for publication in the university's research journals. Publication in the UROP Undergraduate Research Journal is known to be extremely competitive. In many cases, students are asked to submit numerous drafts to the faculty committee for review, only to find out that their papers are later denied publication. In the past, a mere 5% of all submissions were accepted for publication in the journal. [...] UROP is comparable to similar programs at other large universities, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, and the University of Michigan.|$|E

The school attempts to keep class sizes particularly low in comparison to the rest of the state, although this has been hampered by severe funding cuts in the last fifteen years.
