In 1979, the Cheyenne Mountain Complex Improvements Program 427M system became fully operational. It was a consolidated Cheyenne Mountain Upgrade program for command center, space, ballistic missile, and space functions, developed using new software technology and designed for computers with large processing capacity. There were three major segments of the 427M system: the Communication <b>System</b> <b>Segment</b> (CSS), NORAD Computer System (NCS), and Space Computational Center (SCC). The 425L Command and Control System, Display Information Processor, Command Center Processing System, and other hardware were replaced by the NORAD Computer System (NCS). The new system was designed to centralize several databases, improve on-line display capabilities, and consolidate mission warning information processing and transmission. It was intended to have greater reliability and quicker early warning capability. The Command Center Processing System's original UNIVAC 1106, re-purposed for Mission Essential Back-up Capability (MEBU), was upgraded to the more robust UNIVAC 1100/42.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} problem of modeling the joint time-spectral structure of speech for recognition. Four areas are covered in this work: segment modeling, estimation, recognition search algorithms, and extension to a more general class of models. A unified view of the acoustic models that are currently used in speech recognition is presented; the research is then focused on segment-based models that provide a better framework for modeling the intrasegmental statistical dependencies than the conventional hidden Markov models (HMMs). The validity of a linearity assumption for modeling the intrasegmental statistical dependencies is first checked, and it is shown that the basic assumption of conditionally independent observations given the underlying state sequence that is inherent to HMMs is inaccurate. Based on these results, linear models are chosen for {{the distribution of the}} observations within a segment of speech. Motivated by the original work of the stochastic segment model, a dynamical <b>system</b> <b>segment</b> model is proposed for continuous speech recognition. Training of this model is equivalent to the maximum likelihood identification of a stochastic linear system, and a simple alternative to the traditional approach is developed. This procedure is based on the ExpectationMaximization algorithm and is analogous to the Baum-Welch algorithm for HMMs, since the dynamical <b>system</b> <b>segment</b> model {{can be thought of as}} a continuous state vii HMM. Recognition involves computing the probability of the innovations given by Kalman filtering. The large computational complexity of segment-based models is dealt with by the introduction of fast recognition search algorithms as alternatives to the typical Dynamic Programming search. A Split-and-Merge segmentation algorithm is [...] ...|$|E

In this approach we used Hough transform algorithm for skew detection at word level. Skew of the word is the angle of distortion from horizontal line. The image is acquired using scanner or camera and pre-processed for noise removal. After removing noise, each word of document is extracted. Finally Hough transform is applied on each word for skew detection and rotation transformation is used for skew correction. If skew of the word is in positive angle then it is corrected by rotating it in clockwise direction, otherwise it will be rotated in anti-clockwise direction. The proposed <b>system</b> <b>segment</b> words with 97 % accuracy and corrects skew with 92. 88 % accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{retrospectively}} {{examine the}} usefulness of gray-scale reversal imaging of T 2 -weighted images (3 D-T 2 R) {{in conjunction with other}} modes of 3 D MRI for preoperative assessments in patients with glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) due to neurovascular compression. Material/Methods: Imaging findings on 3 D-T 2 R, constructive interference in steady state (CISS), and MRA were analyzed with reference to operative charts in 10 patients with GPN. Results: Offending vessels were associated with the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) in 9 of 10 patients (90 %). Eight of the 10 patients (80 %) had offending vessels located at the supraolivary fossette. Of those eight patients, six (75 %) had a shift of the ipsilateral vertebral artery to the affected side. Five (42 %) and seven (48 %) contact points were associated with the root entry/exit zone and the peripheral nerve <b>system</b> <b>segment,</b> respectively. In six of nine contact points (67 %), 3 D-T 2 R demonstrated the pathomorphological features at the contact points better than CISS. Conclusions: The offending vessels were mostly associated with posterior inferior cerebellar arteries, were frequently located at the supraolivary fossette, and had attachments at the root entry/exit zone and at the peripheral segment of the glossopharyngeal nerve, which was well demonstrated on 3 D-T 2 R...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from American Society of Civil Engineers via the DOI in this record. Isolation valves are crucial components of water distribution systems for separating pipe segments from the network for repair or maintenance purpose. This paper looks at the impacts of isolation valves failure on the three indictors including number of valves that are needed to isolate a distribution <b>system</b> <b>segment,</b> the size of distribution system segments and the shortfall in meeting demands during failure. A network with various isolation valve configurations {{in terms of the}} density of valves is used as a case study. The results obtained from the case study show that the failure of an isolation valve has substantially varying impacts on system performance during a shutdown. The density of valves in the network determines impacts of inoperable valves on a shutdown. Generally speaking, a higher density of isolation valves leads to the less impact of valve failure. Finally, several conclusions drawn from the critical valve analysis in this study could be applied to guide the isolation valve maintenance and management. Bentley Systems provided the software to conduct the hydraulic simulation and valve segmentation.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the time-series modelling of high dimensional data. Currently, the hidden Markov model (HMM) {{is the most}} popular and successful model especially in speech recognition. However, there are well known shortcomings in HMMs particularly in the modelling of the correlation between successive observation vectors; that is, inter-frame correlation. Standard diagonal covariance matrix HMMs also lack the modelling of the spatial correlation in the feature vectors; that is, intra-frame correlation. Several other time-series models have been proposed recently especially in the segment model framework to address the inter-frame correlation problem such as Gauss-Markov and dynamical <b>system</b> <b>segment</b> models. The lack of intra-frame correlation has been compensated for with transform schemes such as semi-tied full covariance matrices (STC). All these models can be regarded as belonging to the broad class of generalised linear Gaussian models. Linear Gaussian models (LGM) are popular as many forms may be trained efficiently using the expectation maximisation algorithm. In this paper, several LGMs and generalised LGMs are reviewed. The models can be roughly categorised into four combinations according to two different state evolution and two different observation processes. The state evolution process can be based on a discrete finite state machine such as in the HMMs or a linear first-order Gauss-Markov process such as in the traditional linear dynamical systems. The observation process can be represented as a factor analysis model or a linear discriminant analysis model. General HMMs and schemes proposed to improve their performance such as STC can be regarded as special cases in this framework. ii...|$|E
