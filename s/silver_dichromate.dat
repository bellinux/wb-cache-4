40|$|When {{recording}} thick holograms, Bragg's law must {{be taken}} into account; this imposes additional limitations on the geometry of the recording sources if the reconstruction geometry is fixed. However, the results we have reported from previous papers do not enable the recording geometry required to give maximum diffraction efficiency of the hologram to be calculated for an arbitrary specified reconstruction geometry when there is a possible change in the thickness and refractive index of the recording medium. Bleached <b>silver</b> halide, <b>dichromated</b> gelatin and <b>silver</b> halide sensitized gelatin are well known techniques for phase holographic formation in commercially available emulsion. These techniques are applicable to volume phase formation. This occurs when the refractive index and/or thickness of the exposed/non-exposed portion of the emulsion varies relative to the bulk unexposed portion. We present theoretical expressions of third-order aberrations in off-axis holographic lenses of different f/No, taking into account the index and thickness variations of the recording materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of the <b>silver</b> sulfate-acid <b>dichromate</b> oxidation (chemical oxygen demand) method for determining the carbon-bound electron compositions of microbial cells, substrates, and metabolic by-products was evaluated. An approach for approximating the carbon-bound electron composition of microbial cells from CHN data is also presented. Ten aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, 17 amino acids, and 8 sugars generally gave 96 to 101 % (mainly â‰¥ 98 %) recovery with 0. 0625 N dichromate (digestion mixture of 10 ml of sample- 10 ml of 0. 25 N dichromate- 20 ml of Ag 2 SO 4 -amended concentrated H 2 SO 4). Recoveries of nicotinic acid (5 %) and methionine (65 %) were incomplete; arginine (125 %) and two purine and three pyrimidine bases (105 to 120 %) were overestimated. The validity of 0. 0625 N dichromate for determining the carbon-bound electron composition of bacterial cells was supported by theoretical analysis of the carbon-bound electron composition of hypothetical bacterial cell material (defined monomer composition) and by the compatibility of elemental and dichromate oxidation-derived carbon-bound electron compositions of typical bacterial cells...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedSelf-organized {{patterns}} can {{be formed}} in diffusion experiments where two interdiffusing electrolytes {{react to form}} an insoluble precipitate in a medium (such as gelatin) that permits diffusive motion of ions, but prevents product particles from moving from their site of formation. Various pattern morphologies such as periodic bands, dendritic crystals, and continuous precipitates can be formed in many types of diffusion media. We hypothesized that interfering ions that {{are not part of}} the dominant precipitation reaction could affect the formation of self-organized patterns in a reproducible fashion, and that the same precipitation reaction occurring in different diffusion media would produce different pattern morphologies (depending on the physical and chemical properties of that medium).; To initially characterize the patterns formed by various diffusion/reaction systems, we performed experiments with ferrous carbonate, phosphate, and hydroxide precipitation in agarose gel. Ferrous compounds were precipitated under reducing conditions, forming self-organized patterns such as periodic bands, and were subsequently oxidized as atmospheric oxygen diffused into the gel. Mineral replacement occurred upon introduction of a reactant that formed a more insoluble compound than the one already present, and after replacement the banding pattern remained unaltered, allowing identification of the original precipitate.; We also characterized the effects of the diffusion medium and interfering ions on self-organized precipitation in silver nitrate/potassium chromate and <b>silver</b> nitrate/potassium <b>dichromate</b> reaction systems. We observed that precipitate morphology was characteristic of the reactants that were initially present and the type of gel medium in which they precipitated. It was found that soluble impurities in agarose gel were responsible for the slight banding produced in silver chromate precipitation experiments. We then tested the effects of organic compounds (simple amino acids and their N-acetylated derivatives) on morphologies of silver chromate precipitates in purified agarose gel. High concentrations of pure amino acids caused periodic banding of crystals, and N-acetyl amino acids were more effective than pure amino acids, because of their negative charge. We hypothesized that the length and orientation of the neutral side chain of the amino acids, as well as charge, affects the degree of binding to the crystal surface, and hence the ability to induce banded patterns.; To better apply these studies to self-organized patterns that form in natural systems, where the diffusion medium may be inhomogeneous (such as sand or sandstone), we studied laboratory and field examples of self-organized mineral precipitates in porous media. Silver chromate precipitation experiments in tubes of glass beads and glass bead/gel mixtures produced structures such as finger fluid fronts, periodic banding, and millimeter-size spherules. The spheroidal precipitates produced in our experiments nucleated via self-organizing processes throughout the glass bead medium, and bear morphological resemblance to iron oxide concretions formed via self-organizing processes in the Navajo Sandstone, UT, that preserve records of fluid flow events in a porous and permeable sandstone...|$|R

The eddy diffusivity and the eddy viscosity {{near the center}} of a pipe have been determined for the case of turbulent, cylindrically symmetric, steady, non-uniform flow*. The eddy properties were calculated from measurements of composition and velocity in a test section 36 in. long and 6 in. in diameter. Natural gas was introduced into a turbulent air stream through an annulus section 1 / 8 in. thick. Experiments were made at Reynolds numbers of 45, 000 and 82, 300. Both eddy properties were found to vary appreciably with distance downstream from the annulus. The eddy diffusivity varied much more than did the eddy viscosity, being less in some regions and much greater in others. However, there appeared to be no tendency for either eddy property to approach zero {{at the center of the}} channel. The results of the experiments are discussed and compared to the data of other workers. IIA. The optical absorbance of the liquid phase of mixtures of nitric acid, nitrogen dioxide**, and water was measured at 32 [degrees]F at wavelengths of 500 and 425 m[ [...] . ]. At the longer wavelength compositions containing 0. 8 or more weight fraction nitric acid were studied. At the shorter wavelength the compositions were limited to a minimum weight fraction nitric acid of 0. 93. The results indicate that the absorbance varies linearly with the weight fraction nitrogen dioxide at small concentrations of this component. The optical absorption appears to be a useful intensive property of the liquid phase to be employed as an aid in determining the composition of the ternary system. IIB. Values of the optical absorbance of solutions of nitrogen dioxide in nitric acid were measured at 32 [degrees]F and one atmosphere using light at a wave length of 425 m[ [...] . ]. The data obtained were applied in a study of the ionisation occurring in the solutions. The numerical solution of simultaneous equations based on equilibrium expressions indicated that in nitric acid solutions containing less than one weight per cent nitrogen dioxide the nitrogen dioxide is about 70 per cent dissociated into nitrosonium ([ [...] . ]) and nitrate ([ [...] . ]) ions whereas the nitric acid is about five per cent dissociated into nitronium ([ [...] . ]) ions, nitrate ions, and water. Although the uncertainty is high, the order of magnitude of these values is correct. III. In aqueous solution, Na 2 S 2 O 4, sometimes called sodium hydrosulfite but more correctly sodium dithionite, undergoes irreversible decomposition at a measurable rate to give NaHSO 3, sodium bisulfate, and Na 2 S 2 O 3, sodium thiosulfate, as products. Studies of this reaction with initial compositions in the range 0. 01 - 0. 10 F Na 2 S 2 O 4 were made with the exclusion of air. A solution of Na 2 S 2 O 4 alone decomposes in a fashion suggesting that a degenerate branching chain mechanism is involved. An apparent positive salt effect on the reaction rate results when NaCl is added to the solution. At values of the concentration of H[superscript+] above 10 [superscript - 3] moles per liter this decomposition is extremely rapid. Initial concentrations*** of the products of decomposition, NaHSO 3 and Na 2 S 2 O 3 less than the initial concentration of [ [...] . ] catalyze the decomposition, indicating that it is autocatalytic in nature. Initial concentrations of [ [...] . ] up to tenfold that of [ [...] . ] markedly catalyze the decomposition. However, in the presence of initial concentrations of NaHSO 3 greater than the initial concentration of [ [...] . ] the chain mechanism is overshadowed, and the reaction is first order with respect to both the species [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ] and is independent of the initial concentration of [ [...] . ] and of the concentration of H[superscript +] but is slightly dependent on the initial concentration of [ [...] . ]. With only [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ] added the reaction rate is greatly inhibited, and part of this effect may be attributed to the corresponding lowering of the concentration of [ [...] . ]. In the presence of initial concentrations of both Na 2 S 2 O 3 and NaHSO 3 which are equimolar or greater than the initial concentration of Na 2 S 2 O 4 the reaction appears to be approximately first order with respect to the concentrations of the species [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ], and [ [...] . ]. In the presence of both [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ], however, the reaction rate is dependent on both the initial concentration of the H[superscript +] and the concentration of [ [...] . ]. Superposed on these overall first order reactions is an inherent periodicity in the reaction rate. The bulk of the kinetics measurements were made at 60 [degrees] C, although several measurements were made at 50 [degrees] and 70 [degrees] C to obtain the activation energy of the thermal decomposition reaction. A few measurements were made at 50 [degrees], 60 [degrees], and 70 [degrees] C of the rapid oxidation of 0. 01 F Na 2 S 2 O 4 in aqueous solution by air. This oxidation reaction appears to be first order with respect to the concentration of [ [...] . ] and is inhibited in basic solutions. A modified analytical procedure employing methylene blue in a basic aqueous solution of methanol or acetone was used to determine Na 2 S 2 O 4 in the presence of large quantities of other reducing agents. IV. A method is described for determining amounts of chromium of the order of a few milligrams. Trivalent chromium is oxidized by fuming perchloric acid in the presence of a small amount of <b>silver</b> ion. The <b>dichromate</b> is then determined iodimetrically. For small amounts of chromium the method gives better results than do other methods listed in the literature. The method has not been tried for large amounts of chromium. *Flow is defined as steady when the average velocity, temperature, and other properties of interest at a point do not change with time. Flow is defined as uniform when the derivatives with respect to x, the coordinate in the direction of flow, of velocity, temperature, and other properties of interest are zero. Uniform flow is theoretically unattainable but may be closely approached in practice. **The term nitrogen dioxide is used to designate equilibrium mixtures of nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen tetroxide. ***Unless otherwise specified, concentrations refer to molar or formal concentrations...|$|R
