50|$|Thysanoplusia orichalcea, the <b>slender</b> <b>burnished</b> <b>brass,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae. It is a {{polyphagous}} pest of vegetable crops that originated in Indonesia, from where it spread to Europe, South Asia, India, Sri Lanka, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In northern Europe it is a migrant species.|$|E

50|$|Diachrysia chrysitis, the <b>burnished</b> <b>brass,</b> is {{a species}} of moth of the family Noctuidae. It is found in Europe, the Caucasus, Russia, Russian Far East and Siberia. In the south of Europe the range extends to {{southern}} Spain, southern Italy and the Balkan peninsula. It is lacking {{on most of the}} Greek Islands. In the north it extends into almost to the Arctic circle and far north Russia. In the east the range extends to the Amur region and Japan.|$|R

The front of the clubhouse featured a long gallery described as a piazza where ladies and friends might view the meet. The interior was decorated in light oak with <b>burnished</b> <b>brass.</b> The fireplace in the entrance hall was decorated with Dutch tiles depicting hunting scenes. The swimming pool was described as [...] "an oriental plunge bathroom all inlaid with white tiles." ...|$|R
5000|$|Benares is {{a pilgrimage}} site in India, {{as it is}} {{considered}} home to Shiva or Visweswara, in Utash Pradesh (Uttar Pradesh State). Benares is particularly famous for its Benares Ware - decorative brass ware and the related popular tourist destination is the Benares Brass Bazaar. Benares is located in an area naturally rich in copper- a requisite ingredient of brass. Benares Brass is highly decorated by engraving, and highly sought after as an antique. Still produced, and available today are new and reproduction wares which may be any combination of embossed, engraved, enameled or <b>burnished</b> <b>brass</b> vessels and brass items.|$|R
6000|$|So they rowed {{into the}} harbour, among a {{thousand}} black-beaked ships, each larger far than Argo, toward a quay of polished stone. And they wondered at that mighty city, with its roofs of <b>burnished</b> <b>brass,</b> and long and lofty walls of marble, with strong palisades above. And the quays {{were full of}} people, merchants, and mariners, and slaves, going to and fro with merchandise among the crowd of ships. And the heroes’ hearts were humbled, and {{they looked at each}} other and said, ‘We thought ourselves a gallant crew when we sailed from Iolcos by the sea; but how small we look before this city, like an ant before a hive of bees.’ ...|$|R

[p.315] Inside there are, or are {{supposed}} to be, three tombs facing the South, surrounded by stone walls without any aperture, or, as others say, by strong planking.[FN#31] Whatever this material may be, it is hung outside with a curtain, somewhat like a large four-post bed. The external railing is separated by a dark narrow passage from the inner, which it surrounds; and is of iron filigree painted of a vivid grass green,-with a view to the garden. Here carefully inserted in the verdure, and doubly bright by contrast, is the gilt or <b>burnished</b> <b>brass</b> work forming the long and graceful letters of the Suls character, and disposed into the Moslem creed, the Profession of Unity, and similar religious sentences.|$|R
25|$|The main iron work gallery covers European wrought {{and cast}} iron from the mediaeval period {{to the early}} 20th century. The master of wrought {{ironwork}} Jean Tijou is represented by both examples of his work and designs on paper. One of the largest items is the Hereford Screen, weighing nearly 8 tonnes, 10.5 metres high and 11 metres wide, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1862 for the chancel in Hereford Cathedral, from which it was removed in 1967. It was made by Skidmore & Company. Its structure of timber and cast iron is embellished with wrought iron, <b>burnished</b> <b>brass</b> and copper. Much of the copper and ironwork is painted {{in a wide range}} of colours. The arches and columns are decorated with polished quartz and panels of mosaic.|$|R
6000|$|But {{when they}} came nearer to the island they saw a wondrous sight upon the cliffs. For on a cape to the westward stood a giant, taller than any {{mountain}} pine, who glittered aloft against the sky like a tower of <b>burnished</b> <b>brass.</b> He turned and looked on all sides round him, till he saw the Argo and her crew; {{and when he saw}} them he came toward them, more swiftly than the swiftest horse, leaping across the glens at a bound, and striding at one step from down to down. And when he came abreast of them he brandished his arms up and down, as a ship hoists and lowers her yards, and shouted with his brazen throat like a trumpet from off the hills, ‘You are pirates, you are robbers! If you dare land here, you die.’ ...|$|R
60|$|But he had {{forgotten}} that though the roofs might be wet the interior was as dry as tinder. He had hardly spoken before a great yellow tongue of flame licked {{out of one of}} the windows, and again and again, until suddenly half of the roof fell in, and the cottage was blazing like a pitch-bucket. The flames hissed and sputtered in the pouring rain, but, fed from below, they grew still higher and fiercer, flashing redly upon the great trees, and turning their trunks to <b>burnished</b> <b>brass.</b> Their light made the enclosure and the manor-house as clear as day, and exposed the whole long stretch of the river. A fearful yell from the woods announced that the savages had seen the canoes, which were plainly visible from the windows not more than a quarter of a mile away.|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{was before}} him, save the foaming, dashing, measureless ocean. But, suddenly, {{as he looked}} towards the horizon, he saw something, a great way off, which {{he had not seen}} the moment before. It gleamed very brightly, almost as you may have beheld the round, golden disk of the sun, when it rises or sets {{over the edge of the}} world. It evidently drew nearer; for, at every instant, this {{wonderful}} object became larger and more lustrous. At length, it had come so nigh that Hercules discovered it to be an immense cup or bowl, made either of gold or <b>burnished</b> <b>brass.</b> How it had got afloat upon the sea is more than I can tell you. There it was, at all events, rolling on the tumultuous billows, which tossed it up and down, and heaved their foamy tops against its sides, but without ever throwing their spray over the brim.|$|R
60|$|We steamed merrily {{out into}} the middle of the bay. The water was slumberously smooth, and under the tawny haze of the morning it shone with the sheen of <b>burnished</b> <b>brass.</b> From the gentle plowing of our bow it rolled lazily to one side, as if in truth it were molten metal. Land, at varying picturesque distances, lay on all sides of us. In some {{directions}} the shore was not more than a mile and a half off; in others, the eye wandered down a vista of water framed by low headlands for ten miles or more. But the atmosphere gave the dominant thought, a strange slumber-like seclusion. So rich and golden, it shut this little corner of the world in a sort of happy valley of its own, and the smoke from my pipe drifted dreamily astern, a natural incense to the spirits of the spot.|$|R
6000|$|I find, too, a {{still more}} {{remarkable}} {{expression of the}} modern spirit in a tract, [...] "The Call of the Kingdom," [...] by that very able and subtle, Anglican theologian, the Rev. W. Temple, who declares that under the vitalising stresses of the war we are winning [...] "faith in Christ as an heroic leader. We have thought of Him so much as meek and gentle {{that there is no}} ground in our picture of Him, for the vision which His disciple had of Him: 'His head and His hair were white, as white wool, white as snow; and His eyes were as a flame of fire: and His feet like unto <b>burnished</b> <b>brass,</b> {{as if it had been}} refined in a furnace; and His voice was as the voice of many waters. And He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword; and His countenance was as the sun shineth in its strength.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{inflorescence}} is 5 - 25 cm {{long and}} it is composed of flowers gathered in dense cylindrical spikes (up to 50 flowers per spike). These inflorescences are scented and genes underlying eugenol (a volatile scent compound) production {{have been identified in}} Gymnadenia conopsea, Gymnadenia odoratissima and Gymnadenia densiflora [...] The flowers are petiolated, placed in the axils of long bracts and reach on average 8 - 14 cm. They have a distinctive three lobed lip and long spurs. Their light scent is similar to cloves. Their colors vary from white and pink to pink-purple, more rarely white. These flowers bloom in the Summer, from June to July. They are hermaphrodite and pollinated by insects (entomophily), including moths. The species is almost exclusively pollinated by moths (Lepidoptera). The most common pollinators are the small elephant hawk-moth (Deilephila porcellus), hummingbird hawk-moth (Macroglossum stellatarum), silver Y (Autographa gamma), <b>burnished</b> <b>brass</b> (Diachrysia chrysitis) and large yellow underwing (Noctua pronuba). Fruit set is high with an average of 73%. The seeds germination is conditioned by the presence of specific fungi.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the first}} day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1, 1863, Burns took up his flintlock musket and powder horn and walked out to the scene of the {{fighting}} that morning. He encountered a wounded Union soldier and asked if he could use his more modern rifle; the soldier agreed and Burns moved on with the rifle and with cartridges in his pocket. Approaching Major Thomas Chamberlin of the 150th Pennsylvania Infantry, Burns requested that he be allowed to fall in with the regiment. Chamberlin later wrote of Burns moving with deliberate step, carrying his Enfield rifle at a trail. His somewhat peculiar dress [...] "consisted of dark trousers and a waistcoat, a blue 'swallow tail' coat with <b>burnished</b> <b>brass</b> buttons, such as used to be affected by well-to-do gentlemen of the old school about 40 years ago, and a high black silk hat, from which most of the original gloss had long departed, of a shape to be found only in the fashion plates of the remote past." [...] Despite his skepticism about the request, Chamberlin referred him to the regimental commander, Colonel Langhorne Wister, who sent the aged Burns into the woods next to the McPherson Farm, where he would find better shelter from the sun and enemy bullets.|$|R
5000|$|He {{retired to}} Hoxton, where he preached privately, {{and at the}} same time {{assisted}} Thomas Doolittle in his school at Bunhill Fields. During 1665, the year of the Great Plague of London, he preached constantly in parish churches. And if Monday night was dreadful, Tuesday night was more dreadful, when far the greatest part of the city was consumed: many thousands who on Saturday had houses convenient in the city, both for themselves, and to entertain others, now have not where to lay their head; and the fields are the only receptacle which they can find for themselves and their goods; most of the late inhabitants of London lie all night in the open air, with no other canopy over them but that of the heavens: the fire is still making towards them, and threateneth the suburbs; it was amazing to see how it had spread itself several times in compass; and, amongst other things that night, the sight of Guildhall was a fearful spectacle, which stood the whole body of it together in view, for several hours together, after the fire had taken it, without flames, (I suppose because the timber was such solid oak,) in a bright shining coal as if it had been a palace of gold, or a great building of <b>burnished</b> <b>brass.</b>|$|R

6000|$|There was {{no further}} speech {{for a long}} time. The hot wind whistled without, and the dry trees sobbed.

60|$|In this way, Walter, so {{far from}} forgetting or losing sight of his {{acquaintance}} with Florence, only remembered it better and better. As to its adventurous beginning, and all those little circumstances which gave it a distinctive character and relish, he took them into account, more as a pleasant story very agreeable to his imagination, {{and not to be}} dismissed from it, than as a part of any matter of fact with which he was concerned. They set off Florence very much, to his fancy; but not himself. Sometimes he thought (and then he walked very fast) what a grand thing it would have been for him to have been going to sea on the day after that first meeting, and to have gone, and to have done wonders there, and to have stopped away a long time, and to have come back an Admiral of all the colours of the dolphin, or at least a Post-Captain with epaulettes of insupportable brightness, and have married Florence (then a beautiful young woman) in spite of Mr Dombey's teeth, cravat, and watch-chain, and borne her away to the blue shores of somewhere or other, triumphantly. But these flights of fancy seldom <b>burnished</b> the <b>brass</b> plate of Dombey and Son's Offices into a tablet of golden hope, or shed a brilliant lustre on their dirty skylights; and when the Captain and Uncle Sol talked about Richard Whittington and masters' daughters, Walter felt that he understood his true position at Dombey and Son's, much better than they did.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The truth is,' {{said the}} man in the train, 'that we live in a {{tropical}} country for three months of the year, only we won't recognise. Look at this.' He handed over a long list of deaths from heat that enlivened the newspapers. All the cities where men live at breaking-strain were sending in their butcher-bills, and the papers of the cities, themselves apostles of the Gospel of Rush, were beseeching their readers to keep cool and not to overwork themselves while the hot wave was upon them. The rivers were patched and barred with sun-dried pebbles; the logs and loggers were drought-bound somewhere up the Connecticut; and the grass {{at the side of the}} track was burned in a hundred places by the sparks from locomotives. Men--hatless, coatless, and gasping--lay in the shade of that station where only a few months ago the glass stood at 30 below zero. Now the readings were 98 degrees in the shade. Main Street--do you remember Main Street of a little village locked up in the snow this spring?[2]--had given up the business of life, and an American flag with some politician's name printed across the bottom hung down across the street as stiff as a board. There were men with fans and alpaca coats curled up in splint chairs in the verandah of the one hotel--among them an ex-President of the United States. He completed the impression that the furniture of the entire country had been turned out of doors for summer cleaning in the absence of all the inhabitants. Nothing looks so hopelessly 'ex' as a President 'returned to stores,' The stars and stripes signified that the Presidential Campaign had opened in Main Street--opened and shut up again. Politics evaporate at summer heat when all hands are busy with the last of the hay, and, as the formers put it, 'Vermont's bound to go Republican.' The custom of the land is to drag the scuffle and dust of an election over several months--to the improvement of business and manners; but the noise of that war comes faintly up the valley of the Connecticut and is lost among the fiddling of the locusts. Their music puts, as it were, a knife edge upon the heat of the day. In truth, it is a tropical country for the time being. Thunder-storms prowl and growl round the belted hills, spit themselves away in a few drops of rain, and leave the air more dead than before. In the woods, where even the faithful springs are beginning to run low, the pines and balsams have thrown out all their fragrance upon the heat and wait for the wind to bring news of the rain. The clematis, wild carrot, and all the gipsy-flowers camped by sufferance between fence line and road net are masked in white dust, and the golden-rod of the pastures that are burned to flax-colour burns too like <b>burnished</b> <b>brass.</b> A pillar of dust on the long hog-back of the road across the hills shows where a team is lathering between farms, and the roofs of the wooden houses flicker in the haze of their own heat. Overhead the chicken-hawk is the only creature at work, and his shrill kite-like call sends the gaping chickens from the dust-bath in haste to their mothers. The red squirrel as usual feigns business of importance among the butternuts, but this is pure priggishness. When the passer-by is gone he ceases chattering and climbs back to where the little breezes can stir his tail-plumes. From somewhere under the lazy fold of a meadow comes the drone of a mowing-machine among the hay--its whurr-oo and the grunt of the tired horses.|$|R
