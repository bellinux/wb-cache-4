The Soviets managed their losses with the formation of 76 horse transport battalions of 500 horses each, and employed reindeer in the Arctic and camels in the South. But overcoming shortage of horses themselves was insurmountable: a work horse matures in three to four years; farm stocks were already depleted of horses as well as tractors. Western European nations, starting with the United Kingdom, witnessed shortage of horses since the 1920s and adjusted their armies accordingly. Germany of the 1920s managed to restore their population of horses, but then it declined again as farm horses were replaced by motor power.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to transporting gas via pipelines {{for use in}} power generation, other end uses for natural gas include export as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or conversion of natural gas into other liquid products via gas to liquids (GTL) technologies. GTL technologies can convert natural gas into liquids products such as gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. A variety of GTL technologies have been developed, including Fischer–Tropsch (F–T), methanol to gasoline (MTG) and STG+. F–T produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products, while MTG can produce <b>synthetic</b> <b>gasoline</b> from natural gas. STG+ can produce drop-in gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and aromatic chemicals directly from natural gas via a single-loop process.

The alloys were a SiMo (Fe 3. 86 Si 0. 6 Mo 3 C) and a Ni-Resist (Fe 32 Ni 5. 3 Si 2. 1 C). Polished sections were exposed at temperatures between 650 and 1, 050 degrees C, mostly for 50 h. The oxidation product was characterized by means of SEM/EDX, AES, XPS and XRD. Iron oxides nodules formed above a continuous layer of Fe-Si-oxide for SiMo. The alloy failed in forming a continuous silica layer at low temperatures. At 850 degrees and above silica was formed, but austenite formation enhanced the decarburization. Escaping CO/CO 2 increased the oxide porosity, and consequently the oxidation rate. The oxidation resistance of Ni-Resist was dependent on Cr assisting the formation of SiO 2. However, this effect was restrained to cell boundaries in particular when water enhanced the Cr evaporation or the diffusion was slow at low temperatures.

One alloy was ferritic (Fe 18 Cr 1. 4 Nb 2. 1 Mn 0. 32 C) and one austenitic (Fe 20 Cr 9 Ni 1. 9 Nb 2. 7 W 0. 47 C). Polished sections were exposed, mostly for 50 h, at temperatures between 650 and 1, 050 degrees C. The oxidation product was characterized by means of SEM/EDX, AES, and XRD. Inter-dendritic non-Cr carbides initiated thick oxides. The ferritic steel formed a rather thin and adherent oxide scale at all temperatures. It consisted of (Mn, Cr) oxide on top of Cr 2 O 3 and, starting at 850 degrees C, a thin silica film at the metal-oxide interface. Chromium depletion triggered dissolution of carbides providing Cr to the oxide. Water vapor did not accelerate the attack since the outer (Mn, Cr) spinel oxide reduced the Cr evaporation. The austenitic grade was very sensitive to water vapor.

Many citizens of countries like the United States and Canada who drive personal cars often, see well over half of their climate change impact stemming from the emissions produced from their cars. Modes of mass transportation such as bus, light rail (metro, subway, etc.), and long-distance rail are far and away the most energy-efficient means of motorized transportation for passengers, able to use in many cases over twenty times less energy per person-distance than a personal automobile. Modern energy-efficient technologies, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and carbon-neutral <b>synthetic</b> <b>gasoline</b> & Jet fuel may also help to reduce the consumption of petroleum, land use changes and emissions of carbon dioxide.

5000|$|Natural gas {{is almost}} always a {{byproduct}} of producing oil, since the small, light gas carbon chains come out of solution as they undergo pressure reduction from the reservoir to the surface, similar to uncapping a bottle of soda where the carbon dioxide effervesces. Unwanted natural gas can be a disposal problem at the well site. If {{there is not a}} market for natural gas near the wellhead it is virtually valueless since it must be piped to the end user. Until recently, such unwanted gas was burned off at the wellsite, but due to environmental concerns this practice is becoming less common. Often, unwanted (or 'stranded' gas without a market) gas is pumped back into the reservoir with an 'injection' well for disposal or repressurizing the producing formation. Another solution is to export the natural gas as a liquid. Gas to liquid, (GTL) is a developing technology that converts stranded natural gas into <b>synthetic</b> <b>gasoline,</b> diesel or jet fuel through the Fischer-Tropsch process developed in World War II Germany. Such fuels can be transported through conventional pipelines and tankers to users. Proponents claim GTL fuels burn cleaner than comparable petroleum fuels. Most major international oil companies are in advanced development stages of GTL production, e.g. the [...] Pearl GTL plant in Qatar, scheduled to come online in 2011.

Particulate matter (PM) is formed as a contaminant in the gasification process, and the aim of this work was to develop and apply a method for sampling and characterization of PM in the hot product gas.   A particle measurement system consisting of a dilution probe combined in series with a bed of granular activated carbon for tar adsorption was developed, with the aim of extracting a sample of the hot product gas without changing the size distribution and composition of the PM. The mass size distribution and concentration, as well as the morphology and elementary composition, of PM in the size range 10 nm to 10 µm in the product gas from a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) gasifier, a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) gasifier and an indirect BFB gasifier using various types of biomass as fuel were determined.   All gasifiers and fuels displayed a bimodal particle mass size distribution with a fine mode in the 0. 5 µm size range. Compared with the mass concentration of the coarse mode the mass concentration of the fine mode was low from all gasifiers. The evaluation of the results for the fine-mode PM was complicated by condensing potassium chloride for the CFB gasifier when using miscanthus as fuel and by condensing tars for the indirect BFB gasifier when using wood C as fuel. The mass concentration of the coarse-mode PM was higher from the CFB gasifier than from the two BFB gasifiers. The coarse-mode PM from the BFB gasifier when using wood A as fuel was dominated by char. In the CFB gasifier the coarse-mode PM was mainly ash and bed material when using all fuels.

The Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was reduced for 16  h at a temperature of 723  K. Following this, the reactor temperature was decreased to the required reaction temperature (413  K). The reactor was then pressurised to the desired pressure (20  barg). Once the reactor had obtained the desired conditions, the reaction was started with a particular flow of PyGas feed of 0.042  ml min− 1 (WHSVPyGas 8  h− 1) and a flow of H 2 /N 2 gas (10  ml min− 1). The PyGas was vaporised and mixed with hydrogen and then passed through the catalyst bed. The hydrogenated PyGas was condensed in a knockout pot, which was chilled to 273  K. Liquid samples were collected every 2  h during daytime and analysed using a Thermo Finnigan Focus G.C. The hydrogenated PyGas mainly condensed in the knockout pot; however, very small amounts of the reaction products remained in the gaseous phase and, therefore, the effluent gas was also analysed at regular intervals by online Agilent G.C. All reactions were run for 76  h. After finishing each reaction, nitrogen gas was passed through the catalyst over night so as to remove any species present in the reactor. The reactor was then cooled to room temperature in the flow of nitrogen gas and then an in situ TPO was performed on the post reaction catalyst. The gas was switched to a flow of 2  % O 2 /Ar (40  ml min− 1) and the temperature increased to 723  K at a ramp of 5  K min− 1 and then the reactor temperature was held constant at 723  K until all evolution of gases other than O 2 and Ar ceased. The TPO process was monitored by an online mass spectrometer (QMS) in which the ion current of main species of mass fragments with m/z 28 (CO), 44 (CO 2), 32 (O 2), 18 (H 2 O) was monitored.
