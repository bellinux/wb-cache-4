5|$|In {{the first}} six days after Baker, when {{radiation}} levels were highest, 4,900 men boarded target ships. Sailors tried to scrub off the radioactivity with brushes, water, soap, and lye. Nothing worked, short of <b>sandblasting</b> to bare metal.|$|E
5|$|Designed without {{expansion}} joints, Time {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of outdoor sculptures made of reinforced pebble/concrete aggregate, few of which have been created since the 1930s. In 1936, Times weather-related cracks were repaired; further work occurred in 1955. The sculpture's subsequent repairs were followed by a rededication celebration in 1966. Although the sculpture received regular maintenance, early repair crews often did more harm than good, by using techniques such as <b>sandblasting</b> and patching cracks with rigid materials.|$|E
5|$|In the arts, {{silicon carbide}} {{is a popular}} {{abrasive}} in modern lapidary due to the durability and low cost of the material. In manufacturing, it is used for its hardness in abrasive machining processes such as grinding, honing, water-jet cutting and <b>sandblasting.</b> Particles of silicon carbide are laminated to paper to create sandpapers and the grip tape on skateboards.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} disinfectants on the tensile bond strength of Nickel-Chromium alloy bonded with resin cement. 180 pairs of Nickel-Chromium dumbbells were prepared. The dumbbells were divided into 3 groups (n= 60), which received {{one of the following}} treatments: <b>Sandblasted</b> only (control), <b>sandblasted</b> and Perform (R) -ID or <b>sandblasted</b> and sodium hypochlorite (SH) before bonding with resin cement. All bonded specimens were stored in distilled water for 24 h and half of the specimens were subsequently thermocycled (500 cycles) before debonding. Tensile bond strength was recorded and each dumbbell was examined for failure mode. Two-way ANOVA analysis indicated that overall there was a statistically significant difference between 24 h and thermocycling test, but no differences between <b>sandblasted</b> only, <b>sandblasted</b> and Perform-ID or <b>sandblasted</b> and SH groups. Post-ANOVA contrasts indicated that only the <b>sandblasted</b> and SH group showed {{a significant difference between the}} 24 h and thermocycling test. Disinfectants did not significantly decrease tensile bond strength between Nickel-Chromium dumbbells bonded with resin cement. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{color of}} the shellac was matched to closets where the wood had not been darkened by {{exposure}} to light. The mosaic floors were recreated by Italian craftsmen {{at a cost of}} $50 per square foot ($538.12 per square meter). A local firm was found that could reproduce the complicated process of <b>sandblasting</b> and hide glue application used to create the original feather chipped glass. This reproduced glass was used to restore the partitions and naturally lit corridors of Root's design. To recreate the doors and wood trim, Donnell purchased the firm that had created the original oak woodwork—and still used the same 19th century machinery. Perfect replicas of the original aluminum light fixtures were fabricated from early photographs and carbon filament light bulbs were obtained to recreate the original lighting effect. A single surviving aluminum staircase was discovered behind a wall, restored, and used as a model to rebuild the lobby stairways and metalwork. The wainscoting on the upper floors was restored with marble salvaged from the recently modernized, nearby 19 LaSalle and Manhattan Buildings. Marble was purchased from the same Italian quarry that supplied Root's original construction to restore the lobby walls and ceilings.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} of the Stumpf was filmed using an actual New Orleans ferry in {{a portion of the}} Mississippi River sectioned off especially for the event; the occurrence took over four hours to prepare. Under the supervision of pyrotechnics expert John Frazier, the ferry was coated entirely with fire retardant and rigged with fifty gasoline bombs including black dirt and diesel, each one set to detonate within a five-second range. People and cars were added in later as elements of computer-generated graphics. Chris Lebenzon was largely responsible for moving clips from each of the sixteen cameras in place to create the sensation of an extended explosion sequence. The spectacular explosion actually caused no significant structural damage to the ferry; after a bout of <b>sandblasting</b> and repainting, the ferry was very similar to its previous state. The ferry was returned into service four days after the production of the film's scene concluded. During filming of the underwater car scenes, actual cars were dropped into the water; computer-generated effects were later added, simulating the entities' explosions. Compositing was done on the Autodesk Inferno special effects program.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sand{{blasting}}</b> or {{bead blasting}} is a generic {{term for the}} process of smoothing, shaping, and cleaning a hard surface by forcing solid particles across that surface at high speeds. <b>Sandblasting</b> equipment typically consists of a chamber in which sand and air are mixed. The mixture travels through a hand-held nozzle to direct the particles toward the surface or workpiece. Nozzles {{come in a variety}} of shapes, sizes, and materials. Boron carbide is a popular material for nozzles because it resists abrasive wear well. In 1870, the <b>sandblasting</b> process was invented and patented by Benjamin Chew Tilghman.|$|E
30|$|The {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} (SEM) images of the bare and <b>sandblasted</b> surfaces of thermoplastic are shown in Fig.  3 b, c. The <b>sandblasted</b> surface was uniformly covered by microstructures, but the bare surface was smooth. To observe the wettability of the <b>sandblasted</b> and bare surfaces, we measured the contact angle (CA) and the contact angle hysteresis (CAH). The CA between the bare thermoplastic surface and the LM droplet (volume ~ 1  μL) is ~ 150 °, and the CAH is ~ 20 °. The CA between the modified surface and the LM droplet is ~ 165 °, and the CAH is ~ 2 °. The smaller CAH of the modified surface indicates that the LM droplet moves more easily on the <b>sandblasted</b> surface than on the bare surface.|$|R

25|$|Silica is an {{occupational}} hazard {{for people who}} do <b>sandblasting,</b> work with products that contain powdered crystalline silica. Amorphous silica, such as fumed silica, may cause irreversible lung damage in some cases, but is not associated with development of silicosis.

25|$|The {{surface of}} Tethys {{is one of}} the most {{reflective}} (at visual wavelengths) in the Solar System, with a visual albedo of 1.229. This very high albedo is the result of the <b>sandblasting</b> of particles from Saturn's E-ring, a faint ring composed of small, water-ice particles generated by Enceladus's south polar geysers. The radar albedo of the Tethyan surface is also very high. The leading hemisphere of Tethys is brighter by 10–15% than the trailing one.|$|E
25|$|The name {{silicosis}} (from the Latin silex, or flint) {{was originally}} used in 1870 by Achille Visconti (1836–1911), prosector in the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan. The recognition of respiratory problems from breathing in dust dates to ancient Greeks and Romans. Agricola, in the mid-16th century, wrote about lung problems from dust inhalation in miners. In 1713, Bernardino Ramazzini noted asthmatic symptoms and sand-like substances {{in the lungs}} of stone cutters. With industrialization, as opposed to hand tools, came increased production of dust. The pneumatic hammer drill was introduced in 1897 and <b>sandblasting</b> was introduced in about 1904, both significantly contributing to the increased prevalence of silicosis.|$|E
25|$|On March 11, 1982, {{the revised}} design was {{formally}} approved, and on March 26, 1982, ground was formally broken. Stone {{for the wall}} came from Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It was chosen because of its reflective quality and also because of opposition to Swedish and Canadian stone, as those countries were destinations for draft evaders. Stone cutting and fabrication was done in Barre, Vermont. The typesetting of the original 58,195 names on the wall was performed by Datalantic in Atlanta, Georgia. Stones were then shipped to Memphis, Tennessee where the names were etched. The etching was completed using a photoemulsion and <b>sandblasting</b> process. The negatives used in the process are in storage at the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
