25|$|The first Griffon-powered Spitfires {{suffered}} from poor high altitude performance due to having {{only a single}} stage supercharged engine. By 1943, Rolls-Royce engineers had developed a new Griffon engine, the 61 series, with a two-stage supercharger. In {{the end it was}} a slightly modified engine, the 65 series, which was used in the Mk XIV. The resulting aircraft provided a <b>substantial</b> <b>performance</b> increase over the Mk IX. Although initially based on the Mk VIII airframe, common improvements made in aircraft produced later included the cut-back fuselage and tear-drop canopies, and the E-Type wing with improved armament.|$|E

On 26 April 2014, Lynx AH.9A ZF540 of the Army Air Corps, crashed near Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan, killing the 3 crew and 2 passengers on board.

25|$|If {{there are}} {{uncertain}} or incomplete clauses in the contract, and all options in resolving its true meaning have failed, {{it may be}} possible to sever and void just those affected clauses if the contract includes a severability clause. The test of whether a clause is severable is an objective test—whether a reasonable person would see the contract standing even without the clauses. Typically, non-severable contracts only require the <b>substantial</b> <b>performance</b> of a promise rather than the whole or complete performance of a promise to warrant payment. However, express clauses may be included in a non-severable contract to explicitly require the full performance of an obligation.|$|E
2500|$|The APLNext VisualAPL {{system is}} a {{departure}} from a conventional APL system in that VisualAPL is a true [...]NET language which is fully interoperable with other [...]NET languages such as VB.NET and C#. VisualAPL is inherently object-oriented and Unicode-based. While VisualAPL incorporates most {{of the features of}} standard APL implementations, the VisualAPL language extends standard APL to be [...]NET-compliant. VisualAPL is hosted in the standard Microsoft Visual Studio IDE and as such, invokes compilation in a manner identical to that of other [...]NET languages. By producing Common Intermediate Language (CIL) code, it utilizes the Microsoft just-in-time compiler (JIT) to support 32-bit or 64-bit hardware. <b>Substantial</b> <b>performance</b> speed-ups over standard APL have been reported, especially when (optional) strong typing of function arguments is used.|$|E

2500|$|For example, in Sumpter v Hedges {{a builder}} {{performed}} £333 worth of work, but then abandoned {{completion of the}} contract. The Court of Appeal held he could not recover any money for the building left on the land, even though the buyer subsequently used the foundations to complete the job. This rule provides a powerful remedy in home construction cases to a customer. So in Bolton v Mahadeva Mr Bolton installed a £560 heating system in Mahadeva's house. However, it leaked and would cost £174 to correct (i.e. 31% of the price). Mahadeva did not pay at all, and the Court of Appeal held this was lawful because the performance was so defective that there could {{not be said to}} be any <b>substantial</b> <b>performance.</b> However where an obligation in a contract is [...] "substantially performed", the full sum must be paid, only then deducting an amount to reflect the breach. So in Hoenig v Isaacs Denning LJ held a builder who installed a bookcase poorly, with a price of £750 but costing only £55 to correct (i.e. 7.3% of the price), had to be paid minus the cost of correction. If a contract's obligations are construed as consisting of an [...] "entire obligation", performance of it all will be a condition precedent (a requirement before) to performance from the other side falling due, and allowing a breach of contract claim.|$|E

40|$|As an {{important}} task in Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT), Topic tracking aims to monitor story stream arranged in temporal order and identify relevant stories to given topics. On this basis Adaptive Topic Tracking focuses on modifying topic descriptions by learning feedbacks {{in real time}} to improve the accuracy of tracking. Many researches have achieved <b>substantial</b> <b>performances</b> in this field, however most of them attempt to resolve the issues of tracking in use of existing techniques in Information Retrieval which often ignore the characteristics of TDT corpus such as timeliness, novelty and burst of news stories. In this paper we propose an incremental novelty learning algorithm (INL) which learns the evolution of topic based on the incremental distribution of novel terms and modifies the topic description by combining seminal terms with novel ones in real time. The algorithm focuses on increasing the efficiency of updating the kernel of topic description and improving the ability of tracking novel events suddenly occurred in story stream. We compare our method with some existing tracking systems on TDT 4 corpus, which demonstrates INL can substantially improve the accuracy of adaptive topic tracking...|$|R
40|$|Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors (CNFETs) can {{potentially}} provide significant energy-delay-product benefits compared to silicon CMOS.
