5|$|Australia {{eventually}} bowled England out for 441, {{leaving them}} {{a target of}} 98 on the final day. Bradman’s openers progressed quickly {{at the start of}} the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, but Morris again lacked fluency. Australia reached 38 from 32 minutes when Bedser bowled Morris for nine, but the tourists steadied to reach their target with eight wickets in hand. After bowling several balls that moved away, Bedser caught out Morris with an inswinger. Morris had developed a habit of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while <b>shuffling</b> towards the off, and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off the pitch. Following the match, Fingleton criticised Morris, feeling that he was <b>shuffling</b> across the crease too much instead of playing from the back foot.|$|E
5|$|Other {{recognized}} motor {{signs and}} symptoms include gait and posture disturbances such as festination (rapid <b>shuffling</b> steps and a forward-flexed posture when walking with no flexed arm swing). Freezing of gait (brief arrests when the feet seem to get stuck to the floor, especially on turning or changing direction), a slurred monotonous quiet voice, mask-like facial expression, and handwriting that gets smaller and smaller are other common signs.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens {{generally}} walk {{when moving}} {{around on the}} ground, though do hop when hurrying. They preen themselves frequently, particularly when roosting {{in the middle of}} the day. They also engage in allopreening, where birds will preen each other's head and neck. This takes place particularly in autumn, winter and spring, and is important in pair bonding. Either member may initiate it, generally by landing near the other bird, <b>shuffling</b> next to its mate, then bending its head forward and presenting its nape.|$|E
40|$|AbstractOperations on {{strings and}} languages, such as <b>shuffle,</b> {{iterated}} <b>shuffle,</b> inverse <b>shuffle</b> and cancellation, {{have been used}} to describe sequentialized execution histories of concurrent processes. The power of these operations and their relation to the usual AFL-operations is studied and it is shown that flow expressions [11, 12], event expressions [8 – 10] and even very restricted variants of them define all the recursively enumerable sets. The family of recursively enumerable languages is equal to the least full trio which is in addition closed under iterated <b>shuffle,</b> and it is also equals the the smallest family of languages containing the finite sets and closed under(a) <b>shuffle,</b> iterated <b>shuffle,</b> and inverse shuffle;(b) <b>shuffle,</b> iterated <b>shuffle,</b> and cancellation;(c) product, iterated <b>shuffle,</b> and cancellation with finite sets;(d) product, iterated <b>shuffle,</b> and inverse <b>shuffle</b> with regular sets;(e) product, iterated <b>shuffle,</b> homomorphisms, and inverse homomorphisms. The family of languages definable by <b>shuffle</b> expressions [6, 12] is incomparable with the family of computation sequence sets [2 – 5]...|$|R
50|$|<b>Shuffle</b> {{tracking}} is {{an advantage}} gambling technique where a player tracks certain cards or sequences of cards {{through a series of}} <b>shuffles.</b> <b>Shuffle</b> tracking is typically done in blackjack games, although it can be done in other card games. Games with simple <b>shuffles</b> are generally easier to <b>shuffle</b> track than games with complicated <b>shuffles.</b> Thus, <b>shuffle</b> tracking is usually done in 6 or 8 deck shoe-dealt blackjack games, as these tend to have simpler <b>shuffles</b> compared to pitch games, due to the time required to accomplish a complicated <b>shuffle</b> on 6 or 8 decks of cards.|$|R

5|$|In the wild, {{little brown}} bats {{can be very}} active during {{the day in the}} spring months, where they can be heard loudly squeaking, <b>shuffling</b> {{position}} and seen hanging out the bottom of the bat house during all hours of the daytime. The average sleep time of a little brown bat in captivity is said to be 19.9 hours per day. This long period of sleep is thought to be a way of conserving energy, by only hunting for a few hours each night when their insect prey are available.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated, with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions. When new genes are assembled from <b>shuffling</b> pre-existing parts, domains act as modules with simple independent functions, {{which can be}} mixed together to produce new combinations with new and complex functions. For example, polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics; they contain up to one hundred independent domains that each catalyse one step in the overall process, like a step in an assembly line.|$|E
5|$|Their {{answer was}} {{surprising}} in two ways. First, they proved that there were, in fact, {{limits to what}} mathematical logic could accomplish. But second (and more important for AI) their work suggested that, within these limits, any form of mathematical reasoning could be mechanized. The Church-Turing thesis implied that a mechanical device, <b>shuffling</b> symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could imitate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction. The key insight was the Turing machine—a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation. This invention would inspire a handful of scientists to begin discussing the possibility of thinking machines.|$|E

5|$|While {{appearing}} in Don't Just Lie There, Say Something! at the Metro Theatre, Sydney in 1971, Terry-Thomas felt unwell and visited a doctor, who noticed his patient's left hand was shaking slightly; the doctor suggested a visit, {{upon his return}} to the UK, to a specialist, who diagnosed the actor with Parkinson's disease. Fearing the condition would affect offers of work, he did not make the news public, but as the symptoms began to manifest themselves in tremors, a <b>shuffling</b> gait, stooped posture and affected speech, he made the news known—partly to stop rumours of on-set drunkenness.|$|E
5|$|Barnes took {{advantage}} of his reprieve to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122, as Yardley made frequent bowling changes {{in an attempt to}} disrupt their progress. Wright came on and bowled a no ball, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. Morris stopped <b>shuffling,</b> while Barnes decided to adopt a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the pitch to Laker. Earlier in the tour, Barnes had often been bowled or trapped lbw trying to force off breaks into the leg side. He drove Laker into the pavilion and Australia were 73/0 at lunch with Morris on 40 and Barnes 25, an overall lead of 208.|$|E
5|$|Prescribed 90 {{medications}} {{during the}} war years by his personal physician, Theodor Morell, Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments. He regularly consumed amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine, as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna (the latter in the form of Doktor Koster's Antigaspills). He suffered ruptured eardrums {{as a result of the}} 20 July plot bomb blast in 1944, and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs. Newsreel footage of Hitler shows tremors in his left hand and a <b>shuffling</b> walk, which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life. Ernst-Günther Schenck and several other doctors who met Hitler in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
40|$|<b>Shuffle</b> {{projection}} {{is motivated}} by the verification of safety properties of special parameterized systems. Basic definitions and properties, especially related to alphabetic homomorphisms, are presented. The relation between iterated <b>shuffle</b> products and <b>shuffle</b> projections is shown. A special class of multi-counter automata is introduced, to formulate <b>shuffle</b> projection in terms of computations of these automata represented by transductions. This reformulation of <b>shuffle</b> projection leads to construction principles for pairs of languages closed under <b>shuffle</b> projection. Additionally, it is shown that under certain conditions these transductions are rational, which implies decidability of closure against <b>shuffle</b> projection. Decidability of these conditions is proven for regular languages. Finally, without additional conditions, decidability of the question, whether a pair of regular languages is closed under <b>shuffle</b> projection, is shown. In an appendix the relation between <b>shuffle</b> projection and the <b>shuffle</b> product of two languages is discussed. Additionally, a kind of <b>shuffle</b> product for computations in S-automata is defined...|$|R
50|$|A perfect <b>shuffle</b> is a riffle {{in which}} the deck is split into two equal-sized packets, and {{in which the}} {{interleaving}} between these two packets strictly alternates between the two. There {{are two types of}} perfect <b>shuffle,</b> an in <b>shuffle</b> and an out <b>shuffle,</b> both of which can be performed consistently by some well-trained people. When a deck is repeatedly <b>shuffled</b> using these permutations, it remains much less random than with typical riffle <b>shuffles,</b> and it will return to its initial state after {{only a small number of}} perfect <b>shuffles.</b> In particular, a deck of 52 playing cards will be returned to its original ordering after 52 in <b>shuffles</b> or 8 out <b>shuffles.</b> This fact forms the basis of several magic tricks.|$|R

5|$|Stowe's house, {{which was}} {{located on the}} bank of the St. Johns River, became a tourist attraction, as riverboats <b>shuffling</b> {{tourists}} from Jacksonville to Palatka or Green Cove Springs passed close by and slowed, so the captains could point out her home to their clients. Eventually a dock was built so that visitors could come ashore and peek into the windows of the home. One, who dared to pull down a tree branch covered with orange blossoms in full bloom over the Stowe's veranda, was chased off the property by Calvin. Local residents who held Stowe in less than high regard insinuated that she worked with the enterprising riverboat captains to pose for tourists.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{remained}} in Germany {{in support of}} V Corps for almost 25 years, seeing no deployments. It underwent a <b>shuffling</b> of units as several of its battalions were reassigned elsewhere {{following the end of}} the Cold War in 1990, and it gained new battalions from units deactivating elsewhere. Though three of the brigade's subordinate battalions deployed to support Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, the brigade headquarters itself {{remained in}} Germany {{along with the rest of}} V Corps. The operations were conducted by VII Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps, which had significant engineer assets of their own. Throughout the early 1990s, the brigade would continue to see units come and go from its command as they were transferred from the restructuring 18th Engineer Brigade and the deactivating 7th Engineer Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Australia progressed {{quickly at}} the start of the chase. Barnes took 13 runs, {{including}} three boundaries, from the opening over, bowled by Bedser, while Morris again lacked fluency. However, Barnes continued to score quickly, and 24 runs came from the first four overs. Yardley tried to stop the run-scoring by bringing on Young, but Morris hit him for four and the bowler was promptly taken off. The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Bedser bowled Morris for nine; after bowling several balls that moved away, Bedser caught out Morris with an inswinger. Morris had developed a habit of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while <b>shuffling</b> towards the off, and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off the pitch. Bradman came to the crease and batted for 12 minutes without getting off the mark. From the 10th ball he faced, the Australian skipper was out for a duck, again caught by Hutton at short fine leg in Bedser's leg trap. Bradman showed obvious displeasure at allowing himself to be dismissed by the same trap in consecutive innings, and his departure left Australia at 48/2. It was the first time in four tours to England that Bradman had made a duck in a Test.|$|E

5|$|King Frederick William IV {{suffered}} a stroke in 1857 and could no longer rule. This led to his brother William becoming Prince Regent of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1858. Meanwhile, Helmuth von Moltke had become chief of the Prussian General Staff in 1857, and Albrecht von Roon would become Prussian Minister of War in 1859. This <b>shuffling</b> of authority within the Prussian military establishment would have important consequences. Von Roon and William (who took an active interest in military structures) began reorganizing the Prussian army, while Moltke redesigned the strategic defense of Prussia by streamlining operational command. Prussian army reforms (especially {{how to pay for}} them) caused a constitutional crisis beginning in 1860 because both parliament and William—via his minister of war—wanted control over the military budget. William, crowned King Wilhelm I in 1861, appointed Otto von Bismarck to the position of Minister-President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck resolved the crisis in favor of the war minister.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather was}} fine as Australia started their second innings {{on the third}} morning. The Australian openers took a {{cautious}} approach to begin with, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that {{were not going to}} hit the stumps, looking for a solid start. Both openers were given early reprieves. Barnes survived a stumping opportunity when he was 18. Laker came on and induced Morris into hitting an airborne ball back down the pitch, but he was slow to react to the possibility of a caught and bowled. According to O'Reilly, most other bowlers {{would have been able to}} reach the ball and attempt a catch. The openers took advantage to combine for an opening stand of 122. Wright came on and again bowled a no ball at the start of his spell, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. After <b>shuffling</b> around with uncertainty at the start of his innings, Morris began to play more fluently. He was eventually bowled for 62, knocking a ball from Wright onto his stumps. The opening partnership laid the platform for Australia's 7/460 declared, which allowed them to set an imposing target of 596 and win by 409 runs to take a 20 series lead.|$|E
