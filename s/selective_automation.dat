40|$|Abstract—Research on {{smart grid}} {{technologies}} has been ad-vancing {{over the last}} years, producing novel practices concerning mainly the power distribution networks. However, in many countries these networks still operate in their traditional form, without offering the real-time operational characteristics which are essential for the utilization of the aforementioned practices. On the other hand, due {{to the extent of}} urban power distribu-tion networks, as well as the substantial cost of medium voltage equipment, the full upgrade of these networks is in most cases not a feasible option. In this work, alternative options of <b>selective</b> <b>automation</b> upgrade in power distribution networks are offered, corresponding to the desired operational status of these networks. More specifically, the essential upgrades are analyzed for the implementation of reliability improvement and loss reduction techniques on such a network.

40|$|This {{project will}} carry out two studies {{directly}} related to digital library collections and services. The first study will investigate how computational tools can provide active support for human resource cataloging by distributed library members. This study will conduct vital targeted research into a challenging problem facing all NSDL efforts: how to effectively enable community members to contribute to {{and participate in the}} ongoing maintenance of their library’s resource catalog. The second study will create, pilot, and evaluate a methodology for developing library technology adoption plans. The results should directly address a critical problem facing all NSDL efforts: in order to improve education, libraries must first be successfully adopted and their use effectively incorporated into the daily practice of both faculty and students. Both studies will be carried out {{in the context of the}} Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) project and will directly impact this project. However, the results from these studies should also have immediate impact on funded work in other NSDL tracks. Towards this end, this project will build the necessary partnerships with other NSDL projects in order to begin the process of piloting the tools and methodologies developed here in other contexts. Study 1 : Active Computational Support for Resource Cataloging. Resource cataloging is a cognitively demanding and time-consuming task. A key challenge is to reduce variability and ensure that different people consistently interpret and apply the library’s resource classification schema when cataloging. Preventing errors and reducing variability are extremely important because both affect the usability and utility of the library’s resource discovery system. Towards this end, I will develop a computational tool that provides active support for distributed human cataloging through: (1) <b>selective</b> <b>automation</b> based on heuristics used by expert human catalogers, and (2) enabling ‘learning-on-demand ’ to reduce variability in performance across catalogers with differing levels of cataloging experience and expertise...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{doctorate}} dissertation is {{the solution of the}} problem of loss reduction by network reconfigurations in Distribution Networks (DNs) in real time, {{and at the same time}} the investigation of potential reliability improvement. At first the implementation of a Multiagent System (MAS) that deals with both aforementioned problems is examined. In this analysis it is considered that the installation of MAS in DNs aims to optimize the problem of faults isolation and power restoration to the maximum possible number of customers within the minimum possible time period after the fault occurance. At the same time the analysis investigates whether the MAS’s installation could contribute in real time management of the network for loss reduction due to the increased automation level that incurs. The results of this analysis show that optimization of both problems presupposes universal automation upgrade in the DN and based on feasibility studies that are presented, the payback time for the required investments could be determined. Next, o novel algorithm that incorporates load variations in the problem of network reconfigurations for loss reduction is presented. It is assumed that the implementation of the proposed algorithm simulates real operational conditions since it takes into account the stochastic load variations and thus, it examines the influence of these variations to the necessary switching operations for optimal reconfigurations. The algorithm is implemented in 3 DNs of the published literature and in a real segment of the urban DN of Thessaloniki. Useful conclusions are depicted regarding the tolerance in load variations that defines whether a new reconfigured topology should be searched or not for real operational conditions. Finally, a novel method is proposed concerning <b>selective</b> <b>automation</b> upgrade in DNs that result in near optimum management for loss reduction in real time, and at the same time contributes in significant reliability improvement. ...|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{agricultural}} water distribution infrastructure in the western United States is aging {{and in need of}} upgrade. Water managers now recognize that improvements [...] to make systems more efficient and responsive [...] are necessary and are striving to find cost-effective solutions. Financial pressures on irrigation districts are increasing, making major rehabilitation prohibitively expensive. Projects throughout the State of Utah have demonstrated that even smaller districts can benefit from <b>selective</b> canal <b>automation</b> technologies. Automated control has resulted in more efficient water management with benefits from improved crop yields, reduced operation and maintenance costs, and water conservation through reduced spillage and seepage. This paper will discuss Utah experiences with low-cost, solar-powered canal automation...|$|R
