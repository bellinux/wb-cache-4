5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is <b>septic</b> <b>arthritis.</b> This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed.

Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E

5|$|S. iniae {{can cause}} {{opportunistic}} infections in weakened or immunocompromised humans. It is most {{commonly associated with}} bacteremic cellulitis, but {{has been known to}} cause endocarditis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and <b>septic</b> <b>arthritis.</b> The first recognized cases of human infection occurred in Texas in 1991 and in Ottawa in 1994, but the sources of infection were not determined. Human infection with S.iniae was also identified in Toronto between 15 and 20 December 1995, when three Asian patients were admitted to a hospital with cellulitis of the hand after injuring themselves while handling raw fish. All three were found to have bacteremia, initially attributed to Streptococcus uberis, but later correctly identified as S.iniae. In February 1996, a Chinese man was admitted to the same hospital with sepsis one week after preparing a fresh whole tilapia, and was also diagnosed with S.iniae bacteremia. A subsequent epidemiological investigation found other cases in the Toronto area, for a total of nine patients; all were of Asian descent and all had handled raw fish (mostly tilapia) before developing infection. Other cases were later identified in the United States and elsewhere in Canada, and have since been reported in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore). Asian descent is a common trend in the majority of invasive human cases, but it is unknown whether this is due to inherent differences in immunity or because of cultural differences in the fish preparation which lend themselves to a higher incidence of infection.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSeptic {{arthritis}} in the {{sternoclavicular joint}} (SCJ) is uncommon. Early diagnosis {{is difficult because}} of its insidious onset and lack of a radiological reference standard. In addition to joint destruction and dysfunction, delayed diagnosis and treatment may result in additional expansion of infection, sepsis, and mortality. Case ReportWe present a previously healthy 38 -year-old man who presented after 10  days of fever and painful swelling on the upper chest. <b>Septic</b> sternoclavicular <b>arthritis</b> and mediastinitis were diagnosed and treated by parenteral antibiotics and staged surgery. The range of motion in the right shoulder completely returned; however, mild weakness of the right shoulder remained. ConclusionIn patients presenting with upper chest, neck, or shoulder pain, physicians should include SCJ arthritis as a differential diagnosis. Multiple imaging examinations are often needed to reach a diagnosis. In <b>septic</b> SCJ <b>arthritis,</b> early institution of appropriate antibiotics is important, and surgical interventions are often needed to eradicate the infection...|$|R
40|$|<b>Septic</b> (poly) <b>arthritis</b> is a {{frequently}} seen severe {{illness in}} neonatal piglets. Although 3 rd generation cephalosporins are often used, amoxicillin is theoretically {{a more efficient}} and more rational choice of treatment. This trial is a pilot-study to determine if Cofamox® 15 LA, a 150 mg/ml amoxicillin suspension, is suitable for treating arthritis in neonatal piglets and investigates the required duration of treatment. Sixty five piglets with signs of arthritis were treated for 2, 3 or 4 days. The piglets were scored for several clinical parameters (such as lameness-score) during 7 days. The results clearly show that a duration of treatment of 3 and 4 days of 15 mg/kg amoxicillin (Cofamox® 15 LA) is effective against arthritis in neonatal piglets, while a duration of 2 days is insufficient. These data suggest that amoxicillin is a potential candidate to replace 3 rd generation cephalosporins for treating <b>septic</b> (poly) <b>arthritis</b> and justify the launch of a large scale trial for registration...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{most common}} cause of low back pain is {{degenerative}} disease of the intervertebral disc and other structures of the lumbar spine. However, in some cases other less frequent causes of such pain can be seen, for example <b>septic</b> facet joint <b>arthritis.</b> Until now, only 40 cases of such inflammatory changes within the spine {{have been reported in the}} literature. The disease isprobably underestimated due to improper diagnostic pathway. Case Report: The authors describe a case of a 53 -year-old woman who was repeatedly hospitalized during a five-month period because of an acute, severe low back pain, with sphincter dysfunction, partially resembling sciatic symptoms. Physical examinations revealed also focal tenderness in the area of the lumbar spine. Inflammatory markers (ESR - erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP - C-reactive protein) were elevated. Conservative analgetic treatment brought only partial and temporary relief of the pain and symptoms. The final accurate diagnosis of isolated <b>septic</b> facet joint <b>arthritis</b> at the level of L 5 /S 1 was established after several months from the onset of the first symptoms, after performing various imaging examinations, including bone scintigraphy as well as CT and MRI of the lumbosacral spine. The patient fully recovered after antibiotic therapy and surgery, which was proven in several follow-up examinations showing no relevant pathology of the lumbar spine. The authors broadly describe the etiology and clinical symptoms of the <b>septic</b> facet joint <b>arthritis</b> as well as the significant role of imaging methods, especially MRI, in diagnostic process. The authors also discuss currently available treatment options, both conservative and surgical. Conclusions: The diagnostic procedure of <b>septic</b> facet joint <b>arthritis</b> requires several steps to be taken. Establishing a correct diagnosis may be difficult, that is why it is important to remember about rare causes of low back pain and to perform detailed physical examination, laboratory tests and choose appropriate imaging techniques...|$|R

40|$|Staphylococcal enterotoxins A through D (SEA through SED) {{and toxic}} shock {{syndrome}} toxin- 1 display superantigen properties, i. e., they stimulate a great fraction of T cells expressing certain T-cell receptor V beta sequences.

In {{the present study}} we decided to employ another five S. aureus strains, each one producing a distinct exotoxin. Almost all rats injected with superantigen-producing strains developed arthritis. In contrast, only 20 % of rats injected with an S. aureus strain lacking superantigen production displayed mild and transient arthritis. Mortality was preferentially induced among the rats inoculated with the S. aureus strains producing SEB and SED.

We determined the number of procedures performed, bone loss originating to control infection, and final reconstruction in these patients. An average of five arthroscopic lavage procedures had been performed at the referring centers. Fungal infection was diagnosed based on pathologic samples; five infections were the result of mucormycosis and one was Candida. After final débridement, the mean segmental bone loss was 12. 8  cm.

25|$|Horses may acquire cellulitis, usually {{secondarily}} to a wound (which can {{be extremely}} small and superficial) or to a deep-tissue infection, such as an abscess or infected bone, tendon sheath, or joint. Cellulitis from a superficial wound usually creates less lameness (grade 1–2 of 5) than that caused by <b>septic</b> <b>arthritis</b> (grade 4–5). The horse exhibits inflammatory edema, which is hot, painful swelling. This swelling differs from stocking up in that the horse does not display symmetrical swelling in two or four legs, but in only one leg. This swelling begins near the source of infection, but eventually continues down the leg. In some cases, the swelling also travels distally. Treatment includes cleaning the wound and caring for it properly, the administration of NSAIDs, such as phenylbutazone, cold hosing, applying a sweat wrap or a poultice, and mild exercise. Veterinarians may also prescribe antibiotics.|$|E

40|$|Macrophage {{migration}} inhibitory factor (MIF) {{accounts for}} one of the first cytokine activities to have been described, and it has emerged recently to be an important regulator of innate and adaptive immunity. MIF is an upstream activator of monocytes/macrophages, and it is centrally involved in the pathogenesis of <b>septic</b> shock, <b>arthritis,</b> and other inflammatory conditions. The protein is encoded by a unique but highly conserved gene, and X-ray crystallography studies have shown MIF to define a new protein fold and structural superfamily. Although recent work has begun to illuminate the signal transduction pathways activated by MIF, the nature of its membrane receptor has not been known. Using expression cloning and functional analysis, we report herein that CD 74, a Type II transmembrane protein, is a high-affinity binding protein for MIF. MIF binds to the extracellular domain of CD 74, and CD 74 is required for MIFinduced activation of the extracellular signal–regulated kinase– 1 / 2 MAP kinase cascade, cell proliferation, and PGE 2 production.

MIF also regulates wound healing processes. Given that fibroblast migration is a central event in wound healing and that MIF {{was recently}} demonstrated to promote leukocyte migration through an interaction with G-protein-coupled receptors, we investigated the effect of MIF on fibroblast migration in wounded monolayers in vitro. Transient but not permanent exposure of primary mouse or human fibroblasts with MIF significantly promoted wound closure, a response that encompassed both a proliferative and a pro-migratory component. Importantly, MIF-induced fibroblast activation was accompanied by an induction of calcium signalling, whereas chronic exposure with MIF down-regulated the calcium transient, suggesting receptor desensitization as the underlying mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} implicated nitric oxide and peroxynitrite in the {{pathogenesis}} of many diseases, such as <b>septic</b> shock, <b>arthritis,</b> lung disease, and atherosclerosis. Nitric oxide ('NO) exerts many diverse effects on vascular tone, affecting neurotransmission and cellular cytotoxicity/communication. Our laboratory and others have documented a proinflammatory role for 'NO in ocular inflammation. Uveitis, which is an inflammation of the highly vascular uveal tract in the eye, is a debilitating condition {{that can lead to}} visual impairment and blindness. It is characterized by acute, recurrent, or persistent inflammation with disruption of the blood-aqueous barrier and is accompanied by protein leakage and leukocyte infiltration into the aqueous humor and anterior chamber. Systemic injection of endotoxin into mice and rats, or intraocular injection of endotoxin into mice, rats, and rabbits induces acute uveitis, which clinically and histologically resembles acute anterior uveitis in humans. These models facilitate the study of pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to ocular inflammation. In addition to 'NO, superoxide anion radicals (02 '-), and peroxynitrite (ONOO-), the products of the reaction between 'NO and 02 '-, are also implicated in uveitis. The role of peroxynitrite in ocular inflammation is still largely unknown. Characterization of the roles of these important uveitic mediators in the ocular inflammatory response will provide information critical to the understanding of {{the pathogenesis of}} intraocular inflammation so that more effective therapeutic intervention(s) can be developed...|$|R
