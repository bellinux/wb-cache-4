50|$|The {{downside}} {{of this method}} {{is that it may}} not be suited for a more complex and repetitive production because it requires perfect contention of the WIP (raw materials and assemblies) on the shop floor: the materials issued to a production order shouldn't interfere with another production order or the next production order of the same kind. This can be done only if all work-steps required to complete the production order are limited more or less to a single work-place. That is why this kind of approach can be implemented for complex products only by using the push <b>strategy.</b> <b>Push</b> strategy means that a complex finished product is divided into many smaller assemblies and even assemblies may contain smaller assemblies and so on. All these assemblies will receive their own production order. These production orders are usually created automatically by the MRP\ERP - system. The ERP system uses Manufacturing resource planning (MRP) for the planning of production orders. Usually only the production planning for the finished product is done manually by the production planner, the assemblies are planned automatically based on backward scheduling. This is especially useful if the assemblies are being produced in another production line, workshop or plant. The {{downside of}} MRP and Push strategy is that it usually leads to larger stocks in the supply chain. That is why Push is regarded as the opposite of lean production because lean production involves the Pull strategy which means that any part should only be produced if there is a certain demand for it and therefore WIP will be small. Push strategy is when MRP is used also to schedule production orders for semi-finished products (assemblies) based on the forecasted demand of the finished product. These assemblies are put into stores without any reference to a certain production order of the finished product. The finished product may not even have had production orders released at the time the assembly was delivered to the store. That is why using MRP to schedule the execution of production orders is by definition a push system because releases are made according to a master production schedule without regard to system status. Hence, no a priori WIP limit exists. However MRP can be designed {{in such a way that}} it has an explicit WIP constraint. That means that assemblies are not produced further if a certain level of inventory is reached. MRP with a WIP constraint can be regarded as a pull system. However, even if a WIP constraint is implemented, Push-strategy generally means that the time, needed from the first operation or assembly until the finished good is obtained, is much longer as opposed to pull-strategy. This is due to the lead-times needed for each assembly and can be analyzed by using a technique called Value stream mapping. There is usually also much more handling: putting the assemblies into the stores, picking the assemblies from stores to the next production step (order) which uses the assembly to make another assembly or finished product. In reality, most firms use both strategies. For example: you could use MRP (push) without WIP constraint to schedule assemblies that are produced in another workshop, plant or external supplier and Kanban (pull) in your own plant. You can also use Kanban to schedule the assemblies in another workshop or plant, but it is usually not done when these assemblies are produced on large machines because with MRP the demand of several days can be comprised in bigger lot sizes of production orders of similar type in such a way that the workshops own scheduling system (MES) is then able to use the available machine-capacity better by bringing the production orders into an optimal sequence using suitable algorithms. This is usually the case when the machines are expensive, their number is relatively small and they have big output-capacities and setup time is expensive. Implementing Kanban in such a case would require to use a bigger number of smaller\cheaper machines, dedicated to certain production lines, in order to react more flexibly to the demand. Another requirement would be that the frequency of transports from\to that plant to be higher and the distance to that plant to be relatively small. These requirements however, cannot be accomplished in each case. On the other side, the workshop (supplier) which manufactures the assemblies may very well use a push strategy or a pull-strategy for delivering the needed materials to each of its own machines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we compare the {{performance}} of the pull and <b>push</b> <b>strategy</b> in a large homogeneous distributed system. When a pull strategy is in use, lightly loaded nodes attempt to steal jobs from more highly loaded nodes, while under the <b>push</b> <b>strategy</b> more highly loaded nodes look for lightly loaded nodes to process some of their jobs. Given the maximum allowed overall probe rate R and arrival rate λ, we provide closed form solutions for the mean response time of a job for the <b>push</b> and pull <b>strategy</b> under the infinite system model. More specifically, we show that the <b>push</b> <b>strategy</b> outperforms the pull strategy for any probe rate R> 0 when λ < φ − 1, where φ = (1 + √ 5) / 2 ≈ 1. 6180 is the golden ratio. More generally, we show that the <b>push</b> <b>strategy</b> prevails if and only if 2 λ < √ (R + 1) 2 + 4 (R + 1) −(R+ 1). We also show that under the infinite system model, a hybrid pull and <b>push</b> <b>strategy</b> is always inferior to the pure pull or <b>push</b> <b>strategy.</b> The relation between the finite and infinite system model is discussed and simulation results that validate the infinite system model are provided.

40|$|Background: New {{technologies}} {{have created a}} growing audience for mobile electronic communication and promotions that companies can utilize. From this, the phenomenon of mobile marketing has evolved, along with methods such as push notifications. Consumers attitudes towards this marketing strategy {{and its effect on}} the equity of brands is however debated in the literature, increasing the relevance of examining this subject in relation to consumer-based brand equity and its dimensions. Based on the importance of CBBE in highly competitive markets and the suggestion of examining the concept on different product categories, the context of fashion and the differentiation between fast fashion and bridge brands were chosen. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the relationship between consumer attitudes towards mobile marketing, namely push notifications, and the dimensions of consumer-based brand equity towards fast fashion and bridge brands. Research Questions: What is the relationship between consumer attitudes towards mobile marketing <b>strategies</b> (<b>push</b> notifications) of fast fashion brands and bridge brands on the dimensions of consumer-based brand equity? How strongly do consumer attitudes towards mobile marketing <b>strategies</b> (<b>push</b> notifications) differ in their influence on the dimensions of consumer-based brand equity for fast fashion brands and bridge brands? Methodology: This research takes on a quantitative approach with an exploratory research design. The chosen data collection method is  perfromed through two independent surveys. Conclusion: Push notifications as a mobile marketing strategy have a direct relationship (and effect) on the brand equity of fashion brands.

That is, a control-oriented reduced model is proposed to approximate the mapping from tip-sample separation to oscillation amplitude, whose accuracy is verified by experimental results. Considering the facts that the parameters of an AM-AFM system vary with different combinations of piezo-scanner and cantilever as well as detected samples, and measuremen-t saturation occurs frequently in dynamic AFM systems, an OFRAC strategy for the piezo-scanner is designed to keep the oscillation amplitude of the cantilever staying at the desired set-point under various complex situation. It is shown theoretically that the proposed control <b>strategy</b> <b>pushes</b> the system away from the saturation state in finite time, and it ensures uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) result for the control error.
