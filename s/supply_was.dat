50|$|A power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> an {{electronic}} device that supplies electric energy to an electrical load. The primary {{function of a}} power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> to convert one form of electrical energy to another. As a result, power <b>supplies</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} electric power converters. Some power <b>supplies</b> <b>are</b> discrete, stand-alone devices, whereas others are built into larger devices along with their loads. Examples of the latter include power supplies found in desktop computers and consumer electronics devices.|$|R
50|$|Power <b>supplies</b> <b>are</b> {{packaged}} {{in different ways}} and classified accordingly. A bench power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> a stand-alone desktop unit used in applications such as circuit test and development. Open frame power supplies have only a partial mechanical enclosure, sometimes consisting of only a mounting base; these are typically built into machinery or other equipment. Rack mount power <b>supplies</b> <b>are</b> designed to be secured into standard electronic equipment racks. An integrated power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> one that shares a common printed circuit board with its load.|$|R
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{resources}} not in short <b>supply</b> <b>was</b> petroleum oil; supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities. Considerable effort and enthusiasm was put into making use of petroleum products as a weapon of war. The Army had not had flame-throwers since the First World War, but a significant number were improvised from pressure greasing equipment acquired from automotive repair garages. Although limited in range, they were reasonably effective.|$|E
5|$|Past {{servicing}} missions have exchanged old {{instruments for}} new ones, both avoiding failure and making possible {{new types of}} science.

40|$|ASEE 2007 Regular power <b>supply</b> cannot <b>be</b> {{used for}} some special {{applications}} such as discharging plasma generator, air purification system, medical discharging equipment, etc. Instead, a special low-power high-voltage pulsed power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> required. In this paper, the design and simulation of a separate excited pulse power <b>supply</b> <b>are</b> proposed. The power supply can produce high-voltage small-current pulses adaptive to different loads. The working principle of the power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> analyzed. A comparison between this power supply and other pulsed power supply based on capacitance energy storage is discussed. The circuit implementation of power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> proposed. The key component for the power supply, pulse transformer, {{as well as other}} components is studied in detail. Based on the analysis, an optimized design of the power <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> proposed. Computer simulation is used to verify the performance of the designed power supply, such as the output characteristics under different load resistances, the pulse frequency and the duty ratio. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed power supply. Some possible performance improvements on the power <b>supply</b> <b>are</b> also suggested. The designed power supply can satisfy the requirements for commercial {{applications such as}} plasma generation and air purification system...|$|R
5|$|The final {{source of}} <b>supply</b> <b>was</b> Allied air drops. This {{was the only}} way to obtain more exotic, highly useful {{equipment}} such as plastic explosives and antitank weapons such as the British PIAT. During the war, 485 air-drop missions from the West (about half of them flown by Polish airmen) delivered some 600 tons of supplies for the Polish resistance. Besides equipment, the planes also parachuted in highly qualified instructors (Silent Unseen), 316 of whom were inserted into Poland during the war.|$|E
5|$|A {{design team}} {{was formed in}} 1946 under the {{leadership}} of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from canard to tailless designs; all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of <b>Supply</b> <b>was,</b> however, interested in the most radical of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental tailless DH 108s to serve as proof of concept aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both low-speed and high-speed flight. During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being accident-prone and unstable, leading de Havilland and BOAC to gravitate to conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical risk. The DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106's power controls.|$|E
5|$|After the {{announcement}} of the device, a lack of <b>supply</b> <b>was</b> evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.|$|E

5|$|Also at {{the dawn}} of the new century, however, rising demand for coffee and rubber gave the Brazilian {{government}} an influx of revenue. Contemporary writers estimated that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee <b>supply</b> <b>was</b> grown in Brazil. Prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and the Baron of Rio Branco, moved to have the country recognized as an international power, as they believed that the short-term windfall would continue. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal. The National Congress of Brazil drew up and passed a large naval acquisition program in late 1904, but it was two years before any ships were ordered. While they first ordered three small battleships, the launch of the revolutionary British Dreadnought—which heralded a new and powerful type of warship—caused the Brazilians to cancel their order in favor of two dreadnoughts, with a third to follow.|$|E
5|$|Early {{housing in}} the village {{consisted}} of groups of thatched cottages clustered around and near the parish church. The influx of workers from areas around the village accompanied an increased demand for extra housing. Even after {{the establishment of the}} local board of health new properties were often built in the gardens of existing dwellings, leading to severe overcrowding. In 1852 the streets were paved with boulders, sewerage was non-existent, and water <b>supply</b> <b>was</b> a local well. During {{the latter half of the}} 19th century new housing was erected alongside the railway, and large areas of open land were soon occupied with new housing estates built for the area's more wealthy residents.|$|E

5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation.

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of the oil supply, nozzle type, air supply, the performance of sliding friction element under the lubrication preloads were investigated by measuring the element’s temperature and friction coefficient based on the M 2000 -A friction wear testing machine.
