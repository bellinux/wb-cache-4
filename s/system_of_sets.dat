40|$|Self-synchronization {{under the}} {{presence}} of additive noise {{can be achieved by}} allocating a certain number of bits of each codeword as markers for synchronization. Difference <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> are combinatorial designs which specify the positions of synchronization markers in codewords {{in such a way that}} the resulting error-tolerant self-synchronizing codes may be realized as cosets of linear codes. Ideally, difference <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> should sacrifice as few bits as possible for a given code length, alphabet size, and error-tolerance capability. However, it seems difficult to attain optimality with respect to known bounds when the noise level is relatively low. In fact, the majority of known optimal difference <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> are for exceptionally noisy channels, requiring a substantial amount of bits for synchronization. To address this problem, we present constructions for difference <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> that allow for higher information rates while sacrificing optimality to only a small extent. Our constructions utilize optimal difference <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> as ingredients and, when applied carefully, generate asymptotically optimal ones with higher information rates.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> of lengths of non-finitely {{generated}} atomic Puiseux monoids (a Puiseux monoid is an additive submonoid of Q_> 0). We begin by presenting a BF-monoid M with full <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> of lengths, {{which means that}} for each subset S of Z_> 2 there exists an element x ∈ M whose set of lengths L(x) is S. It {{is well known that}} systems of sets of lengths do not characterize numerical monoids. Here, we prove that systems of sets of lengths do not characterize non-finitely generated atomic Puiseux monoids. In a recent paper, Geroldinger and Schmid found the intersection of systems of sets of lengths of numerical monoids. Motivated by this, we extend their result to the setting of atomic Puiseux monoids. Finally, we relate the sets of lengths of the Puiseux monoid P = 〈 1 /p | p is prime〉 with the Goldbach's conjecture; in particular, we show that L(2) is precisely the set of Goldbach's numbers.

40|$|This master thesis aims {{to study}} the notions of {{operator}} ideals, generating systems of sets and generating systems of sequences and connections between them. The master thesis consists of seven chapters. In the first chapter the necessary notions and general lemmas are introduced. In the second chapter the definition and historical background {{of the notion of}} relatively (p; r) -compact sets are given, where 1 p 1; 1 r p and p is the conjugate index of p. It is shown that the relatively (1; 1) -compact sets are exactly the relatively compact sets. In the third chapter we look at the notion of an operator ideal. Let the class of all operator ideals be denoted by OI. An operator is said to be (p; r) -compact if it maps every bounded set to a relatively (p; r) -compact set. We denote the class of all (p; r) -compact operators by K(p;r) and show that K(p;r) 2 OI. The fourth chapter starts with the notion of generating <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> that was introduced in [12] by I. Stephani in 1980 s. This notion is of importance because it gives a possibility to generate a new operator ideal from two given generating systems of sets. We denote the class of all generating systems of sets by GHS and define a partial order on GHS. Let the class of all relatively (p; r) -compact sets be denoted by K(p;r). The class K(1; 1) coincides with the class K of the relatively compact sets. The fifth chapter is devoted to the notion of generating system of sequences that was also introduced in [12] by Stephani. Let the class of all generating systems of sequences be denoted by GJS. Stephani showed that from a given generating system of sequences it is possible to generate a new generating <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets.</b> Let g 2 GJS. We denote the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> generated from g by `g. Denote the system of convergent sequences by c. It is easily obtained that `c = K. We define a system G 2 GHS to be generatable if there exists a system g 2 GJS such that `g = G. We ask the question: is the system K(p;r) generatable? More generally, given a system G 2 GHS, how to decide whether this system is generatable? We start the sixth chapter by introducing a pre-order on the class GJS. With the help of this pre-order, we define an equivalence relation on GJS and find 57 the corresponding quotient class GJS=. On this class we now introduce a partial order. We then define operations ! and between the classes GJS= and GHS. We show that these operations (!;) form a Galois connection. Using the Galois connection we give a criterion that allows to decide whether a given generating <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> is generatable. We also give an answer to the question whether the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> K(p;r) is generatable.
