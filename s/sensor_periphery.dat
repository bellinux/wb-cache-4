40|$|We {{present the}} {{co-integration}} of CMOS-compatible Al/Al 2 O 3 interdigitated microelectrodes (IDEs) with an electrokinetic-driven macroelectrode for sensitive detection of whole-cell bacteria in a microfluidic channel. Two frequency ranges {{applied to the}} macroelectrode were identified to notably increase the bacterial coverage of the impedimetric sensor per unit time. Around 10 kHz, the bacterial cells were directed towards the IDE center thanks to AC electroosmosis (AC-EO) and the sensor capacitance linearly increased, achieving a limit of detection (LoD) of 3. 5 × 105 CFU mL− 1 after an incubation time of 20 min with Staphylococcus epidermidis. At 63 MHz precisely, a resonance effect due to the device was found to dramatically increase the trapping of S. epidermidis on the <b>sensor</b> <b>periphery,</b> due to the combined actions of short-range contactless dielectrophoresis (cDEP) and long-range Joule heating electrothermal (J-ET) flow. Thanks to a flow-based method, the bacterial cells were redirected towards the sensor center and an LoD of 105 CFU mL− 1 was achieved within 20 min of incubation, which is almost two orders of magnitude better than the impedimetric sensor alone. Analytical models and 2 D simulations using the Maxwell stress tensor (MST) provide a comprehensive analysis of the experimental results, especially about the spectral balance between cDEP, AC-EO and J-ET accounting for the 33 -nm thick insulating layer atop the electrodes. Electrode CMOS compatibility confers portability, miniaturization and affordability capabilities for building point-of-care (PoC) diagnostic tests in a lab-on-a-chip (LoC) ...|$|E

Real time data of a breathing profile provided by the sensor can be recorded and it is very useful for medical diagnosis. The working principle of the proposed sensor is presented and the developed prototype is described. Experimental testing of the sensor with different proposed materials has been performed.

40|$|Given the {{clinical}} significance of pain disorders {{and the relative}} ineffectiveness of current therapeutics, {{it is important to}} identify alternative means of modulating nociception. The most obvious pharmacological targets are the ion channels that facilitate nervous transmission from pain <b>sensors</b> in the <b>periphery</b> to the processing regions within the brain and spinal cord. In order to design effective pharmacological tools for this purpose, however, it is first necessary to understand how these channels are regulated. A growing area of research involves the investigation of the role that trace metals and endogenous redox agents play in modulating the activity of a diverse group of ion channels within the pain pathway. In the present review, the most recent literature concerning trace metal and redox regulation of T-type calcium channels, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, GABAA (γ-aminobutyric acid A) receptors and TRP (transient receptor potential) channels are described to gain a comprehensive understanding of {{the current state of the}} field as well as to provide a basis for future thought and experimentation...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{transmission}} range, data sensed by each sensor has to be forwarded in a multi-hop fashion before being delivered to the sink. The sensors closer to the sink have to forward comparatively more messages than <b>sensors</b> at the <b>periphery</b> of the network，and will deplete their batteries earlier. Besides {{the loss of the}} sensing capabilities of the nodes close to the sink, a more serious consequence of the death of the first tier of sensor nodes is the loss of connectivity between the nodes at the periphery of the network and the sink; it makes the wireless networks expire. To alleviate this undesired effect and maximize the useful lifetime of the network, we investigate the energy consumption of different tiers and the effect of multiple battery levels, and demonstrate an attractively simple scheme to redistribute the total energy budget in multiple battery levels by data traffic load. We show by theoretical analysis, as well as simulation, that this substantially improves the network lifetime...|$|R
40|$|Aspergillus fumigatus is {{the most}} {{pathogenic}} species among the Aspergilli, and the major fungal agent of human pulmonary infection. To prosper in diverse ecological niches, Aspergilli have evolved numerous mechanisms for adaptive gene regulation, {{some of which are}} also crucial for mammalian infection. Among the molecules which govern such responses, integral membrane receptors are thought to be the most amenable to therapeutic modulation. This is due to the localisation of these molecular <b>sensors</b> at the <b>periphery</b> of the fungal cell, and to the prevalence of small molecules and licensed drugs which target receptor-mediated signalling in higher eukaryotic cells. In this review we highlight the progress made in characterising receptor-mediated environmental adaptation in A. fumigatus and its relevance for pathogenicity in mammals. By presenting a first genomic survey of integral membrane proteins in this organism, we highlight an abundance of putative 7 TMD receptors, the majority of which remain uncharacterised. Given the dependency of A. fumigatus upon stress adaptation for colonisation and infection of mammalian hosts, and the merits of targeting receptor-mediated signalling as an antifungal strategy, a closer scrutiny of sensory perception and signal transduction in this organism is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Joint {{manipulation}} elicits {{a response}} from the <b>sensors</b> in the <b>periphery</b> which, via the spinal cord, arrives in the cortex. The average evoked cortical response recorded using electroencephalography was shown to be highly nonlinear; a linear model can only explain 10 % of the variance of the evoked response, and over 80 % of the response is generated by nonlinear behavior. The goal {{of this study is}} to obtain a nonparametric nonlinear dynamic model, which can consistently explain the recorded cortical response requiring little a priori assumptions about model structure. Wrist joint manipulation was applied in ten healthy participants during which their cortical activity was recorded and modeled using a truncated Volterra series. The obtained models could explain 46 % of the variance of the evoked cortical response, thereby demonstrating the relevance of nonlinear modeling. The high similarity of the obtained models across participants indicates that the models reveal common characteristics of the underlying system. The models show predominantly high-pass behavior, which suggests that velocity-related information originating from the muscle spindles governs the cortical response. In conclusion, the nonlinear modeling approach using a truncated Volterra series with regularization, provides a quantitative way of investigating the sensorimotor system, offering insight into the underlying physiology.

40|$|Large {{wireless}} sensor networks {{promise to}} revolutionize the way we sense and control the physical world. In the envisioned paradigm, large numbers of sensor nodes are scattered throughout the geographical area to be monitored. Due to the limited transmission range, data sensed by each sensor has to be forwarded in a multi-hop fashion before being delivered to a base station. The sensors closer to the base station have to forward comparatively more messages than <b>sensors</b> at the <b>periphery</b> of the network. Assuming that this increased activity of the sensors near the base station translates into a higher power consumption and each node has the same initial battery power, the nodes closer to the base station will deplete their batteries earlier. Besides {{the loss of the}} sensing capabilities of the nodes close to the base station, a more serious consequence of the death of the first tier of sensor nodes is the loss of connectivity between the nodes at the periphery of the network and the base station. Depending {{on the size of the}} network and the actual power consumed for transmission and reception, it is quite possible that a large percentage of the nodes will have almost full batteries, and yet be incapable of reaching the base station due to this loss in connectivity. Effectively, the lifetime of the network has expired. To alleviate this undesired effect, we investigate the effect of multiple battery levels to maximize the useful lifetime of the network. We demonstrate a powerful, yet attractively simple scheme to redistribute the total energy budget in multiple (but few) battery levels. We show by theoretical analysis, as well as simulation, that this substantially improves the network lifetime. ...|$|R
40|$|Tool sets, {{algorithms}} {{and technologies}} developed to create value from {{the availability of}} big data have potential not only to justify and reward the collection of sensor data from space but also {{to improve the quality}} of sensor data collection. The 2017 HawkEye 360 Pathfinder mission will demonstrate the use of tight interactions between constrained, space-based compute platforms with sensor hardware and an approach to ground-segment data processing typical of cloud-based, Big Data analysis to maximize the performance of payload hardware on-orbit. We present specific examples related to the improvement of time- and frequency-of-arrival (TOA and FOA) estimation for AIS transmissions due to specific-emitter characterization on-orbit made feasible by the application of machine learning to take place on the ground. Using a small corpus of raw AIS data captured from commodity hardware on planes over the Chesapeake Bay, we investigate early prototype machine-learning models and test hypotheses as to on-orbit collection improvements. Providing a description of the compute resources available as part of the HawkEye Pathfinder payload, we discuss system design considerations and practical approaches to deploying payload sensor data collection enhancement as part of an automated system for smallsat data collection, ingestion and enhancement. Limitations facing the application of techniques derived from Big Data analytics to the problem of enhanced payload data collection via specific-emitter characterization arise as part of the system design discussion. The HawkEye Pathfinder power budget and payload processing resources will not support constant execution for the most effective methods to enhance TOA and FOA estimation on-orbit, and sensor connectivity to the ground system lags most terrestrial Big Data processing systems in most aspects. We describe the HawkEye Pathfinder analytic software stack, focusing on how it leverages code and concepts developed to enable Big Data processing and how those concepts extend to facilitate improved sensor data collection as part of a mutual feedback system between space and ground processing components. Typical Big Data business models involving power-sensitive commodity hardware <b>sensors</b> at the <b>periphery</b> of a system serviced by a backbone of cloud compute resources have evolved a number of effective open-source and academic software resources amenable to the smallsat use case. We posit ideas for mitigating these factors through the application of predictive analytics...|$|R
