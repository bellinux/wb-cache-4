50|$|Two {{alternative}} versions to the GP-X were produced. The first, {{called the}} Road Racer, {{used the same}} frame as the GP-X in canary yellow powder coat finish, with black V rims and slick tyres.The other was a UK specific beach racer model, with <b>sealed</b> <b>bearing</b> hubs, Black V rims, disc brake as standard, and beach tread tyres.|$|E
50|$|Many {{bearings}} require {{periodic maintenance}} to prevent premature failure, {{but many others}} require little maintenance. The latter include various kinds of fluid and magnetic bearings, as well as rolling-element bearings that are described with terms including <b>sealed</b> <b>bearing</b> and sealed for life. These contain seals to keep the dirt out and the grease in. They work successfully in many applications, providing maintenance-free operation. Some applications cannot use them effectively.|$|E
50|$|The bits {{are further}} {{classified}} {{based on their}} internal bearings. Each bit has three rotating cones and each one will rotate on its own axis during drilling. While the bits are fixed to the drilling rigs, {{the rotation of the}} drill pipe will be in a clockwise direction and the roller cones are rotated in an anti-clockwise direction. Each roller cone is rotated on its own axis {{with the help of the}} bearing. Again, the bearings are classified mainly into three types: Open bearing bits, <b>Sealed</b> <b>Bearing</b> Bits and Journal Bearing bits.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{precursor}} to the current external bearings/through spindle design was developed by Sweet Parts, a micro manufacturer of high end cranks and stems. Their Sweet Wings cranks from the early 1990s incorporated the through spindle concept by attaching the two half pipes coming off each crank arm and held together with a single bolt that resided within the cavity of the spindle itself. Their bottom bracket bearing arrangement was a [...] "hybrid" [...] - the right side was internal while the left side was external (and had the 6805-RS <b>sealed</b> <b>bearing,</b> too).|$|E
50|$|The {{operating}} environment and service needs {{are also important}} design considerations. Some bearing assemblies require routine addition of lubricants, while others are factory sealed, requiring no further maintenance {{for the life of}} the mechanical assembly. Although seals are appealing, they increase friction, and in a permanently <b>sealed</b> <b>bearing</b> the lubricant may become contaminated by hard particles, such as steel chips from the race or bearing, sand, or grit that gets past the seal. Contamination in the lubricant is abrasive and greatly reduces the operating life of the bearing assembly. Another major cause of bearing failure is the presence of water in the lubrication oil. Online water-in-oil monitors have been introduced in recent years to monitor the effects of both particles and the presence of water in oil and their combined effect.|$|E
50|$|Fly reels, or fly casting reels, {{with a few}} exceptions, {{are really}} little more than line-storage devices. In use, a fly angler strips line off the reel {{with one hand while}} casting and {{manipulating}} the rod with the other. Slack line is picked up by rotating the reel spool. Even today, the vast majority of fly reels are manually operated, single-action reels of rather simple construction, with a simple click-pawl drag system. However, in recent years, more advanced fly reels have been developed for larger fish and more demanding conditions. These newer reels feature disc-type mechanical, adjustable drag systems to permit the use of lighter leaders and tippets, or to successfully capture fish that undertake long, powerful runs. Many newer fly reels have large arbors to increase the speed of the retrieve and to improve drag performance during long runs. In order to prevent corrosion, saltwater fly reels often use aluminum frames and spools or stainless steel components with <b>sealed</b> <b>bearing</b> and drive mechanisms.|$|E

50|$|After Walter Sharp died in 1912, Hughes {{purchased}} Sharp's {{half of the}} business. The {{company was}} renamed Hughes Tool Company in 1915, and Hughes, Jr. inherited it after his father's death in 1924. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Hughes Tool Company remained a private enterprise, owned by Hughes. While Hughes was engaged in his Hollywood and aviation enterprises, managers in Houston, such as Fred Ayers and Maynard Montrose, kept the tool company growing through technical innovation and international expansion. In 1958, the Engineering and Research Laboratory was enlarged to accommodate six laboratory sections that housed specialized instruments, such as a direct reading spectrometer and x-ray diffractometer. In 1959, Hughes introduced self-lubricating, <b>sealed</b> <b>bearing</b> rock bits. After collecting data from thousands of bit runs, Hughes introduced the first comprehensive guides to efficient drilling practices in 1960; 1964 saw {{the introduction of the}} X-Line rock bits, combining new cutting structure designs and hydraulic jets.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1920s, the ever-growing {{dissemination}} of <b>sealed</b> <b>bearings</b> throughout the manufacturing industries {{has made the}} use of grease fittings less common. <b>Sealed</b> <b>bearings</b> are lubricated for life at the factory, and are sealed such that the lubricant is not lost or dirtied. Grease fittings are far from obsolete, however, and much new machinery is built with them every year (e.g., tractors, lawnmowers, industrial plant equipment, and still a few car and truck parts). As long as maintenance is even minimally attended to (via occasional lube jobs where new grease is pumped into the bearing), this type of bearing and lubrication setup is cost-effective, simple, and long-lasting.|$|R
