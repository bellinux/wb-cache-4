He was first posted in the Maritimes in 1954, and stayed there for several years until heading to Paris, France to be a staff officer at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). He then {{returned to}} Canada to work at an RCAF station in Moisie, Quebec from 1965 through 1967, as the first fully bilingual RCAF officer. From there he served at the Canadian Armed Forces Headquarters in Ottawa from 1967 through 1971, during which time he was sent to assess the severity of Quebec's 1970 October Crisis. Following his 1971 retirement from the Armed Forces, he took up a position as an administrator at the University of Ottawa, eventually rising to the position of Housing Director. Brooks died on February 1, 1984 of a heart attack while <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk.</b> Four years later, the university named one of the student residences in his honour.|$|E

25|$|Weill, {{shortly after}} graduating from Cornell University, got his first job on Wall Street in 1955 – as a runner for Bear Stearns. In 1956, he became a {{licensed}} broker at Bear Stearns. Rather than making phone calls or personal visits to solicit clients, Weill found he was far more comfortable <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> poring through companies' financial statements and disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For weeks his only client was his mother, Etta, until Joan persuaded an ex-boyfriend to open a brokerage account.|$|E

500|$|In 1922, Macdonald {{became a}} {{part-time}} lecturer {{at the law}} school. When he left the attorney-general's office in 1924, he became a full-time professor. Macdonald was a popular and effective teacher.

500|$|In late 2010 as the Jets were {{preparing}} for the playoffs, a foot fetish video of woman appearing to be Ryan's wife Michelle surfaced on various internet outlets. The video features a clothed Michelle having her bare feet handled and commented on by an unseen camera operator with a voice similar to Rex's. The Jets released a press statement saying that Ryan and the organization considered the situation a private matter and would provide no comment. Multiple media reports soon linked the Ryans to a user profile named [...] "ihaveprettyfeet" [...] on a site for alternative sexual lifestyles, and more videos of Michelle emerged in the following months. In September 2015, a photo of Ryan surfaced of him <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> with a framed photo of a person's feet behind him.|$|E
500|$|Around 1918, {{the leaders}} of the Italian Communists and Anarchists in the United States settled {{themselves}} in New Kensington. The group was guided by the ideas of Carlo Tresca, a union organizer for Industrial Workers of the World, [...] which were recorded first, in his newspaper La Plebe, or The Worker, and later in his anti-fascist paper, Il Martello (which translates to [...] "the hammer"). The Italian Communists and Anarchists harassed members of the Catholic Church. Italians who did go the church were made to feel inferior and many became too intimidated to go to church at all. At St. Peter's, one priest was shot through a window while he was <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk.</b> Another priest was threatened that if he did not leave New Kensington he would be killed. In 1918, there were only thirteen families who attended Mass at St. Peter on Sunday. This continued for several years until Carlo Tresca moved from New Kensington to New York City in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Bentham {{was born}} in Houndsditch, London, England, to a wealthy family that {{supported}} the Tory party. He was reportedly a child prodigy: he was found as a toddler <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>desk</b> reading a multi-volume history of England, {{and he began to}} study Latin at the age of three. He had one surviving sibling, Samuel Bentham, with whom he was close.|$|R

2500|$|Though he {{originally}} {{called his}} salary [...] "liberal," [...] Poe would later complain of his [...] "nambypamby" [...] payment of $800 per year {{when compared to}} Graham's alleged $25,000 in profit. A possibly [...] story is that Poe returned to the office in April 1842 after a brief illness to find Charles Peterson, another editor, <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> and performing his duties. Upset, he impulsively resigned on the spot. By then, however, he had already made {{a significant impact on}} Graham's. A year after Poe's departure, Philadelphia editor George Lippard said, [...] "It was Mr. Poe that made Graham's Magazine what it was a year ago; it was his intellect that gave this now weak and flimsy periodical a tone of refinement and mental vigor".|$|E

2500|$|When Ament {{became aware}} of the {{criticism}} of his activities and the subsequent controversy, he was affected adversely. Ament admitted the strain {{in a letter to his}} wife on Sunday, 27 January 1901: [...] "I am doing what I do not recall that I ever did before, remaining at home deliberately and missing all the services. I need the rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night." [...] Missionary colleague Miss Nellie Naomi Russell (born Ontonagon, Michigan, 31 March 1862; died 22 August 1911 in China) records: ...when he was weary in body and mind, there came like a thunderbolt the article by Mark Twain in the North American Review. I remember that day I went to his study on a matter of business, and found him <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> as if stricken at the heart. I exclaimed, [...] "What is it? Are you ill?" [...] "If I am what that man says, I am not fit for you to speak to me ! I feel as though I should go off and hide myself in a cave in the mountain, never again to be seen of man." [...] I thought he had gone out of his head with all his cares, and I replied, [...] " [...] What you need is rest and a doctor, and I am going to send for one." [...] If the writer of that article could have seen how he suffered he would have felt that every cent he received for that article would be a red hot coal of fire. A brave, masterful man he was, ever ready to relieve, not to add to the sum of human suffering, and while in some things he may have been unwise, his mistakes, whatever they may have been, were of the head and not the heart.|$|E

60|$|He {{stepped outside}} {{and stood by}} the lift, listening. The landing was deserted, {{and there was no}} sound of any one moving anywhere. The lift itself was on the ground floor. It had not ascended {{recently}} or he must have heard it. He returned to his room and softly closed the door. Again the sense of emptiness oppressed him. A faint perfume around the place where she had stood came to him like a whiff of some delicious memory. He set his teeth, lit a cigarette, and <b>sitting</b> down <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> wrote a few lines to his neighbour, embodying the message which had been given him. With the note in his hand he ascended to the next floor.|$|R

Of course, he is wonderful, but Phineas Cross, David Sands and some of the others have shown a positive genius for organisation.

5000|$|Thomas {{worked at}} the Natural History Museum on mammals, {{describing}} about 2,000 new species and subspecies for the first time. He {{was appointed to the}} Museum Secretary's office in 1876, transferring to the Zoological Department in 1878. In 1891 Thomas married Mary Kane, daughter of Sir Andrew Clark, heiress to a small fortune, which gave him the finances to hire mammal collectors and present their specimens to the museum. He also did field work himself in western Europe and South America. His wife shared his interest in natural history, and accompanied him on collecting trips. In 1896 when William Henry Flower took control of the department he hired Richard Lydekker to rearrange the exhibitions, allowing Thomas to concentrate on these new specimens. Officially retired from the museum in 1923, he continued his work without interruption. Although popular rumours suggested he died by shooting himself with a handgun while <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> museum <b>desk,</b> he actually died at home in 1929, aged 71, about a year {{after the death of his}} wife, [...] "a severe blow from which he never recovered".|$|R

60|$|Immediately {{afterwards}} Colonel Osborne went away, and Mrs. Trevelyan {{was left}} alone in her drawing-room. She knew {{that her husband was}} still down-stairs, and listened for a moment to hear whether he would now come up to her. And he, too, had heard the Colonel's step as he went, and for a few moments had doubted whether or no he would at once go to his wife. Though he believed himself to be a man very firm of purpose, his mind had oscillated backwards and forwards within the last quarter of an hour between those two purposes of being round with his wife, and of begging her pardon for the words which he had already spoken. He believed that he would best do his duty by that plan of being round with her; but then it would be so much pleasanter--at any rate, so much easier, to beg her pardon. But of one thing he was quite certain, he must by some means exclude Colonel Osborne from his house. He could not live and continue to endure the feelings which he had suffered while <b>sitting</b> down-stairs <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> with the knowledge that Colonel Osborne was closeted with his wife up-stairs. It might be that there was nothing in it. That his wife was innocent he was quite sure. But nevertheless, he was himself so much affected by some feeling which pervaded him in reference to this man, that all his energy was destroyed, and his powers of mind and body were paralysed. He could not, and would not, stand it. Rather than that he would follow Mr. Poole, and take his wife to Naples. So resolving, he put his hat on his head {{and walked out of the}} house. He would have the advantage of the afternoon's consideration before he took either the one step or the other.|$|R
5000|$|He {{also spoke}} about the lyrical vibe on the EP, saying: [...] "It's like this man. In the thank you section of Something Else, I said, [...] "I can't {{wait to see what}} doors this album opens up for me". So far, it gave me all the content for Therapy. The people who called me [...] "Devil Worshipper" [...] and {{all of these things are}} now sucking the dick. I've got a song that goes, [...] "We don't need no head now we're good!" [...] You were dogging us back then. We don't need head now. We got enough head as it is. [...] "Head Now" [...] is one of my {{favorite}} songs. There are songs about problems with me and my girl. I dreamt a song out there. Ross came to me in a dream. We were <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> control <b>desk</b> and he pointed down at a record, and it said [...] "Hiccup". He looked at me and said, [...] "Hiccup". I woke up, and I had an idea for a song called [...] "Hiccup". I told Ross and Wes. They recorded me doing hiccups and shit. They made a beat around it. I left and went to lunch. I came back, and they had it dude! It was fucking crazy. We just thought it up right there. We did one called [...] "When Demons Come". Everything came from getting recognition from Something Else. That's how my life is. I like my life. [...] "So Much Love" [...] on Something Else had me ready for [...] "When Demons Come". There's so much love you can get lost in this shit. You don't know when something's going to hit. You have to be ready with angels when demons come. Songs like that just came out of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{walked on}} smiling {{up the long}} wharf, {{encumbered}} with trucks and hacks and piles of freight, and, taking {{his way through the}} deserted business streets beyond this bustle, made a point of passing the door of Lapham's warehouse, on the jambs of which his name and paint were lettered in black on a square ground of white. The door was still open, and Corey loitered a moment before it, tempted to go upstairs and fetch away some foreign letters which he had left on <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> and which he thought he might finish up at home. He was in love with his work, and he felt the enthusiasm for it which nothing but the work we can do well inspires in us. He believed that he had found his place in the world, after a good deal of looking, and he had the relief, the repose, of fitting into it. Every little incident of the momentous, uneventful day was a pleasure in his mind, from <b>his</b> <b>sitting</b> down <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> to which Lapham's boy brought him the foreign letters, till his rising from it an hour ago. Lapham had been in view within his own office, but he had given Corey no formal reception, and had, in fact, not spoken to him till {{toward the end of the}} forenoon, when he suddenly came out of his den with some more letters in his hand, and after a brief [...] "How d'ye do?" [...] had spoken a few words about them, and left them with him. He was in his shirt-sleeves again, and his sanguine person seemed to radiate the heat with which he suffered. He did not go out to lunch, but had it brought to him in his office, where Corey saw him eating it before he left <b>his</b> own <b>desk</b> to go out and perch on a swinging seat before the long counter of a down-town restaurant. He observed that all the others lunched at twelve, and he resolved to anticipate his usual hour. When he returned, the pretty girl who had been clicking away at a type-writer all the morning was neatly putting out of sight the evidences of pie from the table where her machine stood, and was preparing to go on with her copying. In his office Lapham lay asleep in his arm-chair, with a newspaper over his face.|$|R
