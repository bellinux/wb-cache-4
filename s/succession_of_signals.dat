40|$|Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectra were {{recorded}} on a magnetic sector mass spectrometer using the point detector {{by using the}} laser pulses to outline the ion peaks. The instrument was set to scan slowly so that about 10 laser shots were fired during the time the instrument took to scan over a mass peak. This procedure produced a <b>succession</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> that defined the ion peak profile. The profile was then obtained by smoothing the data. Although slow, this technique enables the mass spectrum to be obtained in a single scan and also enables high resolution data to be acquired; the spectrum of the biantennary N-linked glycan [(Gal) 2 (Man) 3 (GlcNAc) 4] was recorded at a resolution of 15 000. The liquid binary matrix of 3 -aminoquinoline and a-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid, introduced by Colli and Orlando, was initially used but was found to produce Schiff base derivatives with glycans possessing a free reducing terminus. Other binary mixtures giving prolonged ion beams were investigated and a mixture of 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid and 2, 4, 6 -trihydroxyacetophenone found to be reasonably satisfactory although less so than 3 -aminoquinoline and a-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid. Spectra were normally recorded as single scans from about 100 pmol of sample loaded. For low concentrations, {{in the range of}} 1 – 10 pmol, spectra were averaged to produce better signal:noise ratios. The method was used to record the spectra of N-linked glycans released from glycoproteins. # 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEpithelial–mesenchymal {{interactions}} are {{crucial for the}} development of the endoderm of the pharyngeal pouches into the epithelia of thymus and parathyroid glands. Here we investigated the dynamics of epithelial–mesenchymal interactions that take place at the earliest stages of thymic and parathyroid organogenesis using the quail-chick model together with a co-culture system capable of reproducing these early events in vitro. The presumptive territories of thymus and parathyroid epithelia were identified in three-dimensionally preserved pharyngeal endoderm of embryonic day 4. 5 chick embryos on the basis of the expression of Foxn 1 and Gcm 2, respectively: the thymic rudiment is located in the dorsal domain of the third and fourth pouches, while the parathyroid rudiment occupies a more medial/anterior pouch domain. Using in vitro quail-chick tissue associations combined with in ovo transplantations, we show that the somatopleural but not the limb bud mesenchyme, can mimic the role of neural crest-derived pharyngeal mesenchyme to sustain development of these glands up to terminal differentiation. Furthermore, mesenchymal-derived Bmp 4 appears to be essential to promote early stages of endoderm development during a short window of time, irrespective of the mesenchymal source. In vivo studies using the quail-chick system and implantation of growth factor soaked-beads further showed that expression of Bmp 4 by the mesenchyme is necessary during a 24 h-period of time. After this period however, Bmp 4 is no longer required and another signalling factor produced by the mesenchyme, Fgf 10, influences later differentiation of the pouch endoderm. These results show that morphological development and cell differentiation of thymus and parathyroid epithelia require a <b>succession</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> emanating from the associated mesenchyme, among which Bmp 4 plays a pivotal role for triggering thymic epithelium specification...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel Bayesian {{strategy for the}} estimation <b>of</b> smooth <b>signals</b> corrupted by Gaussian noise. The method assumes a smooth evolution <b>of</b> a <b>succession</b> <b>of</b> continuous <b>signals</b> that can have a numerical or an analytical expression with respect to some parameters. The Bayesian model proposed {{takes into account the}} Gaussian properties of the noise and the smooth evolution <b>of</b> the successive <b>signals.</b> In addition, a gamma Markov random field prior is assigned to the signal energies and to the noise variances to account for their known properties. The resulting posterior distribution is maximized using a fast coordinate descent algorithm whose parameters are updated by analytical expressions. The proposed algorithm is tested on satellite altimetric data demonstrating good denoising results on both synthetic and real signals.

The {{activation}} of immune cells {{in response to}} a pathogen involves a <b>succession</b> <b>of</b> <b>signaling</b> events leading to gene and protein expression, which requires metabolic changes to match the energy demands. Here, the metabolic profile associated with the MEK/ERK cascade in macrophages was studied and the effect of its inhibition on the specific metabolic pattern of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation was characterized. A [1, 2 - 13 C 2]glucose tracer-based metabolomic approach was used to examine the metabolic flux distribution in these cells. Bioinformatic tools were used to analyze changes in mass isotopomer distribution and changes in glucose and glutamine consumption and lactate production in basal and LPS-stimulated conditions in the presence and absence of the selective inhibitor of the MEK/ERK cascade, PD 325901. Results showed that PD 325901 -mediated ERK 1 / 2 inhibition significantly decreased glucose consumption and lactate production, but did not affect glutamine consumption. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in the glycolytic flux, consistent with the observed decrease in fructose- 2, 6 -bisphosphate (Fru- 2, 6 -P 2) concentration. The oxidative and non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathways (PPP) and the ratio between them also decreased. However, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux did not change significantly. LPS activation led to the opposite responses, although all these were suppressed by PD 325901. However, LPS also induced a small decrease in PPP fluxes and an increase in glutamine consumption that were not affected by PD 325901. We conclude that inhibition of the ERK 1 / 2 cascade interferes with central metabolism, and this crosstalk between signal transduction and metabolism also occurs in the presence of LPS.

40|$|International audienceA chorus {{generation}} {{mechanism is}} discussed, {{which is based}} on interrelation of ELF/VLF noise-like and discrete emissions under the cyclotron wave-particle interactions. A natural ELF/VLF noise radiation is excited by the cyclotron instability mechanism in ducts with enhanced cold plasma density or at the plasmapause. This process is accompanied by a step-like deformation of the energetic electron distribution function in the velocity space, which is situated at the boundary between resonant and nonresonant particles. The step leads to the strong phase correlation of interacting particles and waves and to a new backward wave oscillator (BWO) regime of wave generation, when an absolute cyclotron instability arises at the central cross section of the geomagnetic trap, in the form <b>of</b> a <b>succession</b> <b>of</b> discrete <b>signals</b> with growing frequency inside each element. The dynamical spectrum of a separate element is formed similar to triggered ELF/VLF emission, when the strong wavelet starts from the equatorial plane. The comparison is given of the model developed using some satellite and ground-based data. In particular, the appearance of separate groups <b>of</b> chorus <b>signals</b> with a duration 2 - 10 s can be connected with the preliminary stage of the step formation.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of monetary policy implementation In {{the years since}} New Zealand’s financial markets were liberalised in 1984 / 5, and indirect methods replaced direct controls, the Reserve Bank’s approach to monetary policy implementation has evolved considerably. 1 The changes have largely reflected shifts {{in our understanding of}} how monetary policy and financial markets work.
