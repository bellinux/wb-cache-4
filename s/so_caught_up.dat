5|$|A sexual {{harassment}} lawsuit was filed against Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{in the previous}} episode, and she must take a {{sexual harassment}} training as a result. In addition, she cannot return to work until she is done with her training. Liz, however, cannot handle life without work, as she needs the stress. Her attitude changes when she meets one of her neighbors, Emily (Elizabeth Marvel). She understands how Liz feels because she was just like Liz and tells her there are better ways to live. Liz hangs out with Emily and her friends (Mary Catherine Garrison, Kerry Butler, and Christina Gausas), who spend majority of their time getting spa treatments and going shopping. Liz gets <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> in their lifestyle that she forgets to watch her show, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). Not wanting {{to come back to}} work—as she is intrigued by her new friends' lifestyle—Liz sexually harasses her counselor, Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane). She goes back to hanging out with Emily and her friends, but soon discovers that they are a Girl Fight Club, which disappoints Liz. In order for her to get out, Liz needs to fight them.|$|E

Some of the messianists were <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with their hope, that they {{interpreted}} each new erosion in the Rebbe's health, and ultimately his very death, as stages in the messianic process. They cited various midrashic statements to fuel their ecstasy as to the imminent revelation of the Messiah, {{and some of them}} drank and toasted l’chaim and danced before and during the funeral - an act that shocked many admirers of Schneerson across the Jewish world. And in the days after Schneerson's death, many journalists and pundits wrote how they expected the end of the movement.|$|E
500|$|The {{displays}} continued {{throughout the}} First World War, {{except that the}} use of rockets was prohibited under the Defence of the Realm Act. Reflecting contemporary events, the theme for the 1915 display was [...] "The Battle of the Marne"; in 1916 it was [...] "The War in Flanders", during which one spectator got <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> in the action that he waded across the lake to join in with the [...] "fighting". Anticipating the outbreak of the Second World War, the theme for the 1933 display was [...] "Air Raid on London".|$|E

500|$|One {{frequently}} criticised {{aspect of}} the game was its low and inconsistent frame rate. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, [...] "The game's inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels." [...] In contrast, IGN {{pointed out that the}} frame rate [...] "can be sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for some odd reason it's never really bothersome. Most of the time you're <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> in the game that you don't notice it, and when you do, you're willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark is just too much fun to dwell on such an issue". Poole also described the [...] "lazy sci-fi fetishism" [...] of Joanna Dark's character design as [...] "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.|$|E
2500|$|We were <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> {{in our own}} {{wild ride}} that we were being swept along doing what we were doing, and, I mean, at the time, we were meeting all these bands that we idolised and, and, were big fans of ... and, um, got to play gigs with them all ...

2500|$|Cherryh's works depict {{fictional worlds}} with great realism {{supported}} by her strong background in languages, history, archaeology, and psychology. In her introduction to Cherryh's first book, Andre Norton compared {{the effect of}} the work to Tolkien's: [...] "Never since reading The Lord of the Rings have I been <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> in any tale as I have been in Gate of Ivrel." [...] Another reviewer commented, [...] "Her blend of science and folklore gives the novels an intellectual depth comparable to Tolkien or Gene Wolfe". [...] Cherryh creates believable alien cultures, species, and perspectives, causing the reader to reconsider basic assumptions about human nature. Her worlds have been praised as complex and realistic because she presents them through implication rather than explication. She describes the difficulties of translating/expressing concepts between differing languages. This is best demonstrated in both the Chanur and Foreigner series.|$|E
2500|$|She is, however, {{at pains}} to stress the {{differences}} between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books {{you go into a}} world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday world. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. I got <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal." [...] New York Times writer Charles McGrath notes the similarity between Dudley Dursley, the obnoxious son of Harry's neglectful guardians, and Eustace Scrubb, the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until converted by Aslan.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group was}} reprised when Johnson joined Mark O'Toole (bass) and Peter [...] "Ped" [...] Gill to form FGTH. During a {{particularly}} fluid period of personnel changes, Jed O'Toole joined FGTH on guitar, {{and a female}} vocalist, Sonia Mazumder, was also a band member for the first Frankie gig at the Leeds nightclub [...] "The Warehouse", supporting Hambi & The Dance. Paul Rutherford [...] {{a member of the}} headline act who had also sung in seminal Liverpool punk band The Spitfire Boys [...] apparently got <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> in Frankie's performance that he effectively replaced Mazumder that very night. The new all-male musical line-up subsequently toured locally with a leather-clad female duo known as [...] "The Leatherpets" [...] and managed to fund promotional videos and demos, despite being eventually turned down by both Arista Records and Phonogram Inc. In October 1982, the group recorded a John Peel Session for BBC Radio 1, comprising the originals [...] "Krisco Kisses", [...] "Two Tribes", [...] "Disneyland", and [...] "The World Is My Oyster". Around this time Jed O'Toole left the group, to be replaced by the returning Brian Nash.|$|E

2500|$|J. K.

[...] Nevertheless, she is at pains to stress the differences between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books you go into a world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong.

60|$|At {{these words}} the Sheriff's men stood {{as still as}} stocks, for they knew right well that Little John would {{be as good as}} his word, and that to disobey him meant death. In vain the Sheriff roared at them, calling them cowards, and urging them forward in a body; they would not budge an inch, but stood and watched Little John as he moved slowly away toward the forest, keeping his gaze fixed upon them. But when the Sheriff saw his enemy thus {{slipping}} betwixt his fingers he grew mad with his rage, so that his head swam and he knew not what he did. Then of a sudden he turned his horse's head, and plunging his spurs into its sides he gave a great shout, and, rising in his stirrups, came down upon Little John like the wind. Then Little John raised his deadly bow and drew the gray goose feather to his cheek. But alas for him! For, ere he could loose the shaft, the good bow that had served him so long, split in his hands, and the arrow fell harmless at his feet. Seeing what had happened, the Sheriff's men raised a shout, and, following their master, came rushing down upon Little John. But the Sheriff was ahead of the others, and <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with the yeoman before he reached the shelter of the woodlands, then leaning forward he struck a mighty blow. Little John ducked and the Sheriff's sword turned in his hand, but the flat of the blade struck the other upon the head and smote him down, stunned and senseless.|$|E

60|$|He stood motionless, listening; but {{no sound}} broke the morning slumbrousness, except the faraway {{warbling}} of a thrush {{in the first}} light. So sudden and transitory had been the experience that it seemed now to be illusory; yet it had <b>so</b> <b>caught</b> him <b>up,</b> it had with so furtive and sinister a quietness broken in on his solitude, {{that for a moment}} he dared not move. A cold, indefinite sensation stole over him that he was being watched; that some dim, evil presence was behind him biding its time, patient and stealthy, with eyes fixed unmovingly on him where he stood. But, watch and wait as silently as he might, only the day broadened at the window, and at last a narrow ray of sunlight stole trembling up into the dusky bowl of the sky.|$|R

2500|$|Between 30 July and August 1809 Camilla {{was one of}} {{the many}} vessels {{participating}} in the debacle of the Walcheren Campaign. On 3 November, Camilla, under temporary captain William Henry Dillon, encountered the Drie Gebroeders. She was sailing from Norway under a Danish master and with a cargo of timber. On her deck were a number of wooden trucks for gun-carriages, which were obviously war material. The master stated that he was taking his cargo to Britain so Dillon let him proceed. After two hours, the merchant vessel was plainly heading toward the Dutch coast <b>so</b> Dillon <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with the vessel and seized it. The master explained that he was sailing toward Holland only to avoid [...] "the Lemon and Oar", a dangerous reef in the North Sea.

2500|$|Race 1 narrative: An {{aggressive}} pre-start by BMW Oracle Racing {{forced a}} foul by Alinghi, {{which had not}} {{taken advantage of the}} diagonal start line allowed for the port-entry boat. [...] Both boats wound up head to the wind over the start line. Alinghi bore off while BMW Oracle Racing remained stalled and started c.650m behind (1:27). BMW Oracle Racing were clearly able to sail higher and faster (average speed 20.2 kt vs. 19.4 kt), <b>so</b> they <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with Alinghi within 15 minutes and thereafter extended their lead eventually winning by over 3,000m. Upwind they were able to out-sail Alinghi even without a jib and their speed differential was greater downwind (23.5 kt vs. 20.7 kt average speed) than upwind. The final delta includes a penalty turn by Alinghi due to not keeping clear at the start. Without the penalty turn the delta was about 8½ minutes. Winds were 5 to 10 knots. Partial timings for the winner were 1h29 upwind, 1h03 downwind.|$|R
