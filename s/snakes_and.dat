40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to know the effectiveness of <b>Snake</b> <b>and</b> Ladder board Games in teaching vocabulary. This research was conducted at one of Private Junior High School in Purwokerto. The Research design used is experimental study. The research findings imply {{that the use of}} <b>Snake</b> <b>and</b> Ladder Board Game can foster the students 2 ̆ 7 vocabulary than those taught using translation. In learning vocabulary, the essential problem faced by the students is how to remember the vocabulary. Findout the vocabulary by themselves, it will help students to memorize the vocabulary longer. Having long term memory about the vocabulary makes them easily to retrieve it when they need it. By implementing <b>Snake</b> <b>and</b> Ladder game, the students will find out their vocabulary easily. They will find out the vocabulary when they have to answer the question in the board. The board providing word, phrase or simple question and the picture as the key word will help them to find out the vocabulary. Besides that, the unforgettable moments when they play <b>Snake</b> <b>and</b> ladder game will help students to memorize the acquired vocabulary easily or it will encourage students to have long term memory about the vocabulary.

5|$|Michigan, one of {{the fifty}} United States, is home to two types of lizards, {{nineteen}} types of <b>snakes</b> <b>and</b> eleven types of turtles, {{all members of the}} class Reptilia. Reptiles are found throughout Michigan, although the only venomous species, the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, is seen only in the Lower Peninsula. Reptiles are cold-blooded, and so usually pass the cold winters of Michigan in frost-free areas, such as underground burrows (for <b>snakes</b> <b>and</b> land-dwelling turtles) or the bottoms of lakes and streams (for water-dwelling turtles). Most reptiles in Michigan are protected by state law, but many are still at risk due to human encroachment on their habitats, the draining of wetlands and, in the case of snakes, indiscriminate killing by fearful humans. In 1995, the painted turtle was named as Michigan's state reptile.|$|E

5|$|Reptiles are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} turtles, tuataras, lizards, <b>snakes</b> <b>and</b> crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the <b>snakes</b> <b>and</b> a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian {{but there is a}} septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.|$|E
