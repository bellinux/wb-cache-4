5|$|There {{were some}} {{attempts}} to conserve the huia, {{but they were}} few, poorly organised and poorly enforced legally: the conservation movement in New Zealand was <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> its infancy. There were successive sharp declines in numbers of huia in the 1860s and in the late 1880s, prompting the chiefs of the Manawatu and the Wairarapa to place a rāhui on the Tararua Range. In February 1892, the Wild Birds Protection Act was amended to include the huia, making it illegal to kill the bird, but enforcement was not taken seriously. Island sanctuaries were set up for endangered native birds after this act, but the new bird sanctuaries, including Kapiti Island, Little Barrier Island and Resolution Island, were never stocked with huia. Although {{attempts were made to}} capture birds for transfer, no huia were ever transferred. The Kapiti Island attempt is documented as being particularly poorly managed. A live pair destined to be transferred to the island in 1893 was instead appropriated by Buller, who bent the law to take them back to England as a present for Lord Rothschild, along with the last collected live pair of laughing owls.|$|E

25|$|The {{final proof}} that the golden days had ended for Blackpool Football Club came during the 1961–62 season, when Stanley Matthews {{returned}} to Stoke after fourteen years on the Lancashire coast. Despite the loss, Blackpool finished the season thirteenth. They also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup, {{in which they were}} beaten by Norwich City over two legs. The competition was <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> its infancy, however; indeed there was no Wembley final to look forwards to.|$|E
25|$|Temporary {{heat sinks}} are {{sometimes}} used while soldering circuit boards, preventing excessive heat from damaging sensitive nearby electronics. In the simplest case, this means partially gripping a component using a heavy metal crocodile clip, hemostat or similar clamp. Modern semiconductor devices, which {{are designed to}} be assembled by reflow soldering, can usually tolerate soldering temperatures without damage. On the other hand, electrical components such as magnetic reed switches can malfunction if exposed to hotter soldering irons, so this practice is <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> use.|$|E

25|$|When {{the news}} reached Europe, Christians were horrified and Pope Sergius IV sent a {{circular}} letter to all churches {{calling for a}} holy fight in the Middle East and expulsion of Muslims from the Holy land. The events would later be recalled by Pope Urban II in his preaching for the Crusade at Clermont.

25|$|JR {{is beyond}} despair, {{but rather than}} {{drinking}} his sorrows away, {{he talks about his}} feelings in great detail to Babe, something which Babe has always wanted from him. Babe blames herself for Dixie's death. JR assures her that he would never wish her dead in his mother's place, but when he catches Babe and Josh kissing in a shed, he forces her to choose between her mother's secret of being pregnant with Tad's baby or custody of Little Adam. Babe pleads with JR that the kiss he witnessed was just a goodbye kiss, and that she is <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> love with him, but JR does not believe her. Babe is devastated when JR verbally lashes out that she should have died instead of Dixie.|$|E
25|$|The {{other major}} {{sticking}} point, which is reportedly causing concern at government level, {{is that the}} majority of people going to Potsdamer Platz are visitors to the city, implying that the original vision of the development as a linking element attracting Berliners themselves, and Berliners {{from both sides of the}} former divide, has not really materialised. There are criticisms that the development does not sit easily with or connect with its surroundings, and as a result Berliners have had difficulty accepting it as theirs (despite the fact that the choice of Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan was partly because it was the only one to address the way the development juxtaposed with the Cultural Forum immediately to the west, although the Cultural Forum has itself faced similar criticisms of its own). Another, more psychological factor that has played a part here is that a long-standing mutual distrust or antipathy felt between former East Berliners and West Berliners (Ossis and Wessis according to the well-known slang terms), is <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> evidence in the city and elsewhere in Germany, and bold civil engineering projects and architectural statements are not going to make it go away by themselves. Politicians past and present have been accused of short-sightedness in speculating that they would.|$|E

25|$|Mark grows fond of Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), {{who is in}} a rocky {{relationship}} with his enemy, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). When she leaves Phil, she turns to Mark. Mark takes her in and they start dating, much to Pauline's horror. Together, they concoct a plan to pretend that she is expecting Mark's baby when Phil is the actual biological father. To facilitate their lie, Mark insists that he'd taken all necessary precautions in relation to his HIV and they fool everyone for a while. Mark loves Lisa so much that he stays with her after she shoots Phil (who survives), and Mark proposes shortly after baby Louise's birth. However, Louise's godmother, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), tells Phil the truth about Louise's parentage and vows to {{take an active role in}} his daughter's upbringing. Mark and Lisa marry, but their happiness is short-lived: Lisa is <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> love with Phil and Phil knows it so he seduces her in order to get more access to Louise. After Sharon discovers Phil's intentions, she talks him out of his plan and he ends the affair with Lisa, but Mark finds out and leaves the Square for a while. After just five months of marriage, Lisa leaves Mark and resumes her affair with Phil. However, Lisa soon realizes her mistake and wants to reconcile with Mark but Pauline refuses to tell her where Mark has gone.|$|E

[...] Portrayer Sela Ward has described her character as a window into House's vulnerability and his heart. House simply describes Stacy as [...] "very convincing", as Mark thinks {{there is nothing wrong with}} him, but House says that if Stacy says that Mark is ill, he is ill. Many critics noted that Stacy's presence affected House's behaviour, Diane Kristine of Blog Critics stated that, with Stacy, House was [...] "almost nice". While Stacy has told House on several occasions that she loves Mark, she is <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> love with House and was willing to have an affair with him; however, she admits that she finds House selfish and that [...] "with Mark, there's room for [...] ".|$|E
