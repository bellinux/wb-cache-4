5|$|Typhula quisquiliaris spores are {{narrowly}} ellipsoid, {{and measure}} from 9 to 14 by 4 to 5.5 micrometres (μm). The spores are white, and contain small granules. The spores are borne on basidia which measure 50 to 70 by 7 to 8 μm, with four spores on each basidium. The downy covering {{of the stem}} {{is made up of}} thick-walled hairs, each measuring 15 to 60 by 3 to 7 μm, though they are often swollen towards the base. The <b>sclerotium</b> measures from 1.5 to 3 by 0.5 μm, and is a pale yellow colour. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|White rot of onions, leeks, {{and garlic}} {{is caused by}} the soil-borne fungus <b>Sclerotium</b> cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, the spore {{color is}} white. The spores are smooth, {{ellipsoidal}} to tear-shaped, hyaline (translucent), not amyloid, and measure 3.9–5.2 by 2.6–3.3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are four-spored and hyaline, with dimensions of 16–20 by 4–5μm. They have clamps at their bases. There are no cystidia on either the edges (cheilocystidia) or faces (pleurocystidia) of the gills. The arrangement of the hyphae in the hymenophoral tissue varies from regular to interwoven. The cap cuticle is a cutis (a type of tissue where the hyphae are arranged more or less parallel to the surface), formed by hyphae with septa, roughly 4–9μm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae. The <b>sclerotium</b> is made of hyphae that have yellow pigment in their walls that appear in cross-section to be pseudoparenchymatous (compactly interwoven short-celled hyphae that resemble parenchyma of higher plants), and measure 5–10μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Reid {{considered}} the genus allied to Leucogyrophana, then thought {{to belong to}} the family Coniophoraceae. Marinus Anton Donk, in a monograph published the next year, agreed and placed it close to Serpula and Coniophora; these genera are now known to represent early-diverging lineages in the Boletales order. However, the white spore print and small, smooth, and hyaline spores are not characteristic of species in the Coniophoraceae. In a large-scale phylogenetic analysis published in 2006, Podoserpula nested far from them in the Plicaturopsis clade, an evolutionarily related group of early-diverging members of the Agaricales order. Other taxa in this clade include Plicaturopsis and <b>Sclerotium</b> rolfsii. The entire clade was later separated into three smaller orders, Podoserpula becoming a member of the Amylocorticiales along with mostly corticioid genera such as Amylocorticium and Serpulomyces.|$|E
500|$|The fruit bodies (technically called apothecia) of W.americana are erect and spoon- or ear-shaped, and {{may reach}} up to [...] tall by [...] wide with the edges usually rolled inward. The outside surface is dark brown, while the inner surface—the spore-bearing hymenium—is pinkish orange to dull purplish red or brown at maturity. The outer surface may develop {{wrinkles}} in maturity. The apothecia, which occur singly or {{in groups of}} up to about 25, arise from a short stalk. The stalk is variable in length and solid, dark outside, white within. The stalks originate from a <b>sclerotium,</b> a compact mass of hardened mycelium. The <b>sclerotium</b> has an almost gelatinous consistency with irregularly shaped lobes and internal chambers, and may reach a diameter of [...] The sclerotium's function is thought to supply moisture and nutrients, or {{to serve as a}} resistant structure capable of sustaining the fungus through times of stress. W.macrotis is the only other species in the genus to bear a <b>sclerotium.</b>|$|E
500|$|The cell has {{chemotactic}} {{and negative}} phototactic capabilities in this phase, {{meaning that it}} is able to move towards nutrients and away from dangerous substances and light. The movements originate in the grainy cytoplasm, which streams by pulsation in one direction within the cell. In this way the cell reaches a speed of up to 1000µm per secondthe speed in plant cells is 2 to 78µm per second. A resting state, the so-called <b>sclerotium,</b> may occur in this phase. The <b>sclerotium</b> is a hardened, resistant form composed of numerous [...] "macrocysts", which enable the myxogastria to survive in adverse conditions, for example during winter or dry periods, in this phase.|$|E
500|$|The gills are adnate (bluntly {{fused to}} the stem), {{becoming}} subdecurrent with age (running slightly {{down the length}} of the stem). The gill spacing is close to subdistant, and the individual gills are whitish to pinkish-buff, thin, narrow to moderately broad, and have straight edges. The stem is [...] long by , and roughly equal in width throughout its length. It is slender and thread-like, flexible and pliant, with a dry surface. The top of the stem is covered with scales or a fine whitish powder, while the lower portion has hairs ranging from delicate to coarse. The color of the stem is generally whitish to pinkish-buff, but it darkens after it has been handled. The stem interior is pithy, and becomes hollow with age. The stems originate from a dark reddish-brown <b>sclerotium</b> of variable shape, typically measuring [...] by [...] The surface of the <b>sclerotium</b> is initially smooth, but later becomes wrinkled or furrowed; its interior is solid and white. It is often compared to an apple seed in appearance. Typically, several sclerotia are connected by thin strands of mycelia. The <b>sclerotium</b> is a resting structure that allows to fungus to overwinter in its host. In 1915, William Murrill reported the sclerotia of C.tuberosa to be bioluminescent.|$|E
500|$|The stem is [...] long by 1mm thick, {{roughly equal}} in width throughout, and tapers {{to a long}} [...] "root" [...] which terminates in a dull black, roughly spherical <b>sclerotium.</b> The stem may be buried deeply in its substrate. The stem surface is roughly {{the same color as}} the cap, with a fine whitish powder on the upper surface. In the lower portion, the stem is brownish, and has fine grooves that run {{lengthwise}} up and down the surface. The lower half is covered with irregularly arranged short branch-like protuberances at right angles to the stem that measure 2–3 by 0.5mm. These projections are cylindrical and tapering, with ends that are covered with a slime head of conidia (fungal spores produced asexually). D.racemosa is the only mushroom species known that forms conidia on side branches of the stem. The <b>sclerotium</b> from which the stem arises is watery grayish and homogeneous in cross section (not divided into internal chambers), with a thin dull black outer coat, and measures [...] in diameter. American mycologist Alexander H. Smith cautioned that novice collectors will typically miss the <b>sclerotium</b> the first time they find the species. The edibility of D.racemosa is unknown, but as David Arora says, the fruit bodies are [...] "much too puny and rare to be of value." ...|$|E
500|$|Collybia tuberosa, {{commonly}} known as the lentil shanklet or the appleseed coincap, is an inedible species of fungus in the Tricholomataceae family, and the type species of the genus Collybia. Like the two other members of its genus, it lives on the decomposing remains of other fleshy mushrooms. The fungus produces small whitish fruit bodies with caps up to [...] wide held by thin stems up to [...] long. On the underside of the cap are closely spaced white gills that are broadly attached to the stem. At the base of the stem, embedded in the substrate is a small reddish-brown <b>sclerotium</b> that somewhat resembles an apple seed. The appearance of the <b>sclerotium</b> distinguishes it from the other two species of Collybia, which are otherwise very similar in overall appearance. C.tuberosa is found in Europe, North America, and Japan, growing in dense clusters on species of Lactarius and Russula, boletes, hydnums, and polypores.|$|E
500|$|The caps {{of young}} {{mushrooms}} are roughly spherical, but soon become convex to flattened in maturity, and reach diameters of [...] The cap margin is rolled or curled inward when young, but straightens out as it matures. The cap color is white to cream. The gills are broadly adnate to slightly decurrent, with a color {{similar to the}} cap; their spacing is close to subdistant. The whitish stem is equal in width throughout, usually not straight but with curves, and [...] long by [...] thick. The upper region of the stem surface can be covered with {{what appears to be}} a white powder, and there are thin hairs near the base. The stems originate from a yellowish-brown <b>sclerotium</b> that is up to [...] long. The <b>sclerotium</b> ranges in shape from roughly spherical to almond-shaped to irregular, and its surface is often wrinkled and pitted. The mushroom has no distinctive odor or taste, and its edibility is unknown.|$|E
500|$|The stem is [...] {{long and}} up to [...] thick, equal in width {{throughout}} to slightly enlarged downward, flexible and filamentous but not fragile. The stem surface is dry, whitish to grayish-orange, sometimes with tiny hairs on the upper portion that become coarser near the base. The stem base often has rhizomorph-like strands or copious whitish mycelia. The stem, unlike the other two species of Collybia, do not originate from a <b>sclerotium.</b> The stem becomes hollow as it matures. Although it is not considered poisonous, C.cirrhata is too small and insubstantial to be considered edible.|$|E
500|$|Typhula quisquiliaris {{produces}} fruit {{bodies in}} the form of clubs. Each fruit body consists of a single distinct [...] "stem" [...] and [...] "head", and measures up to [...] in height. The surface of the head is smooth and white, and measures [...] by [...] The rounded stem is infertile, and of a similar colour to the head. However, it has a very fine [...] covering, and is somewhat translucent. The stem measures from [...] in width. The stem attaches to <b>sclerotium</b> which is buried into the branch from which the fruit body grows.|$|E
500|$|The cortex (outer tissue layer) of the <b>sclerotium</b> {{can be used}} as a {{diagnostic}} character to distinguish between D.racemosa and small white specimens of Collybia. The hyphae of the cortex of D.racemosa are [...] "markedly angular", in comparison with C.cookei (rounded hyphae) and C.tuberosa (elongated hyphae). The cortical layer in D.racemosa [...] has an arrangement that is known as textura epidermoidea—with the hyphae arranged like a jigsaw puzzle. Heavy deposits of dark reddish-brown pigment are evident throughout the cortical tissue in or on the walls and the tips of hyphae. The remaining Collybia species, C.cirrhata, does not form sclerotia.|$|E
500|$|Collybia cookei is {{a species}} of fungus in the Tricholomataceae family, and one of three species in the genus Collybia. It is known from Europe, Asia, and North America. The fungus {{produces}} fruit bodies that usually grow on the decomposing remains of other mushrooms, like Meripilus giganteus, Inonotus hispidus, or species of Russula; occasionally fruit bodies are found on rich humus or well-decayed wood. The fungus produces small white mushrooms with caps up to [...] in diameter, supported by thin stems that originate from a yellowish-brown <b>sclerotium.</b> The mushroom is difficult to distinguish from the other two species of Collybia unless an effort is made to examine the sclerotia, which is usually buried in the substrate. The edibility of the mushroom has not been determined.|$|E
500|$|The {{saprobic}} {{behaviors of}} Collybia and Dendrocollybia are slightly different. In the autumn, fruit bodies of C.cirrhata, C.cookei and C.tuberosa, {{can be found}} on blackened, leathery, mummified fruit bodies of their hosts. Sometimes, these species appear to be growing in the soil (or from their <b>sclerotium</b> in soil or moss), but usually not in huge clusters. In these cases it is assumed that the [...] hosts are remnants of fruit bodies from a previous season. In all observed cases of D.racemosa, however, the hosts have not been readily observed, suggesting that rapid digestion of the host (rather than mummification) may have taken place. Hughes and colleagues suggest that this may indicate the presence of a different enzymatic system, and a differing ability to compete with other fungi or bacteria.|$|E
500|$|Typhula quisquiliaris, {{commonly}} known as the bracken club, is a species of club fungus in the family Typhulaceae. It produces small, white fruit bodies up to [...] in height, each with a single distinct [...] "head" [...] and [...] "stem". The head is fertile, while the stem attaches to a <b>sclerotium</b> embedded in the substrate. The fruit bodies grow from dead wood, and strongly favours bracken, where the species feeds saprotrophically. Though T.quisquiliaris was described under a different name by James Sowerby in 1803, the specific name quisquiliaris was sanctioned in 1821 by Elias Magnus Fries, and the species was moved to the genus Typhula, which resulted in its currently accepted binomial name by Paul Christoph Hennings in 1896. The species has been recorded in Europe and north Africa.|$|E
500|$|Collybia cirrhata is {{a species}} of fungus in the Tricholomataceae family of the Agaricales order (gilled mushrooms). The species was first {{described}} in the scientific literature in 1786, but not validly named until 1803. Found in Europe, Northern Eurasia, and North America, it is known from temperate, boreal, and alpine or arctic habitats. It is a saprobic species that grows in clusters on the decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms. The fruit bodies are small, with whitish convex to flattened caps up to [...] in diameter, narrow white gills, and slender whitish stems [...] long and up to [...] thick. C.cirrhata can be distinguished from the other two members of Collybia {{by the absence of}} a <b>sclerotium</b> {{at the base of the}} stem. The mushroom, although not poisonous, is considered inedible because of its insubstantial size.|$|E

5000|$|P. tuber-regium is a {{saprotroph}} {{found on}} dead wood, including Daniellia trees in Africa. [...] As the fungus consumes the wood, {{it produces a}} <b>sclerotium,</b> or storage tuber, either within the decaying wood or in the underlying soil. These sclerotia are round, dark brown with white interiors, and up to 30 cm wide. The fruiting bodies then emerge from the <b>sclerotium.</b> Both the <b>sclerotium</b> and the fruiting bodies are edible.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1911 by Italian mycologist Pier Andrea Saccardo, based on specimens {{sent to him}} by Peter Henry Rolfs who considered the unnamed fungus to {{be the cause of}} tomato blight in Florida. The specimens sent to Saccardo were sterile, consisting of hyphae and sclerotia. He placed the species in the old form genus <b>Sclerotium,</b> naming it <b>Sclerotium</b> rolfsii.
