40|$|AbstractWe {{amplified by}} {{polymerase}} chain reaction the heavy and light chain antibody genes of two mouse hybridomas secreting neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the G 1 or G 2 envelope proteins of Hantaan virus, cloned them into the phagemid vector pComb 3, and expressed them in bacteria to yield Fab fragments. Expressed Fab fragments had the same antigenic specificities for Hantaan and <b>Seoul</b> <b>viruses</b> as the complete parent MAbs {{and were able to}} neutralize Hantaan virus in plaque-reduction neutralization assays. The authentic MAb to G 2 (HCO 2) could passively protect hamsters from challenge with Hantaan virus when neutralizing antibody titers of at least 1 : 10 were detected in the animals’ sera just prior to challenge. In contrast, although 1 : 10 neutralization titers were also detected in hamsters receiving passively transferred,Escherichia coli-expressed HCO 2 Fab, these animals were not protected from infection with Hantaan virus. Similarly, passive transfer of the HCO 2 MAb on Days 1 through 4 after infection prevented antigen deposition in hamster lungs and kidneys but passive transfer of the recombinant HCO 2 Fab did not. The results suggest that although neutralization by IgG antibodies correlates with protection in hamsters, the same may not be true for neutralizing Fab fragments...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{worldwide}} distribution, {{most of the}} known <b>Seoul</b> <b>viruses</b> (SEOV) {{are closely related to}} each other. In this study, the M and the S segment sequences of SEOV were recovered from 130 lung tissue samples (mostly of Norway rats) and from six patient serum samples by reverse transcription-PCR. Genetic analysis revealed that all sequences belong to SEOV and represent 136 novel strains. Phylogenetic analysis of all available M and S segment sequences of SEOV, including 136 novel Chinese strains, revealed four distinct groups. All non-Chinese SEOV strains and most of the Chinese variants fell into the phylogroup A, while the Chinese strains originating from mountainous areas clustered into three other distinct groups (B, C, and D). We estimated that phylogroup A viruses may have arisen only within the last several centuries. All non-Chinese variants appeared to be directly originated from China. Thus, phylogroup A viruses distributed worldwide may share a recent ancestor, whereas SEOV seems to be as diversified genetically as other hantaviruses. In addition, all available mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of Norway rats, including our 44 newly recovered mtDNA sequences, were divided into two phylogenetic groups. The first group, which is associated with the group A SEOV variants, included most of rats from China and also all non-Chinese rats, while the second group consisted of a few rats originating only from mountain areas in China. We hypothesize that an ancestor of phylogroup A SEOV variants was first exported from China to Europe and then spread through the New World following the migration of Norway rats...|$|R

40|$|Thottapalayam virus (TPMV), {{a member}} of the genus Hantavirus in the family Bunyaviridae, was {{isolated}} from an insectivore, Suncus murinus (musk shrew), captured in southern India in 1964. While the isolation of TPMV predates the discovery of the prototype Hantaan virus, little is known about its genetics and biology. To date, preliminary evidence suggests that TPMV differs significantly, both antigenically and genetically, from all known rodent-borne hantaviruses. However, since detailed epizootiological studies have not been conducted, it is unclear if TPMV is naturally harbored by an insectivore host or if TPMV represents a “spillover” from its natural rodent reservoir host. Moreover, to what extent TPMV causes infection and/or disease in humans is not known. To address these issues, we first studied the antigenic profile of TPMV using monoclonal antibodies against Hantaan and <b>Seoul</b> <b>viruses</b> and polyclonal immune sera against Puumala virus and TPMV. Armed with this newfound information, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for the diagnosis of TPMV infections in shrews and humans, using a recombinant TPMV N antigen manipulated to have an E 5 /G 6 epitope to be captured by monoclonal antibody clone E 5 /G 6. Using this assay, we found anti-TPMV antibodies in sera from a patient with high fever of unknown etiology in Thailand and from two shrews captured in Indonesia. Seropositivity was verified by the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test, Western blotting analysis, and focus reduction neutralization test. Collectively, our data indicate that TPMV is harbored by Suncus murinus as its host in nature and is capable of infecting humans...|$|R
40|$|Hantaviruses as {{a member}} of the family Bunyaviridae are RNA viruses with enveloped, negative-sense, {{single-stranded}} segmental genome. Today, more than 20 different Hantavirus species are recognized. Eleven of them cause clinical symptoms in humans. Hantaan (HTNV), Puumala (PUUV), Dobrava (DOBV), <b>Seoul</b> <b>viruses</b> causes different forms of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), since Sin Nombre virus and Sin Nombre-like viruses found especially in the United States causes hantaviruses pulmonary syndrome (HPS) with high mortality. In our country, infections have been reported with subtypes of the Hantaviruses firstly PUUV in the Western Black Sea region, then DOBV from Giresun and Kastamonu. A case of Hantavirus infection similarly in the form of RSHF from the rural area of Kazan district in Ankara has been reported in this article. Sixty-seven-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency room with complaints of dizziness, fever and fatigue in June of 2011. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia elevated liver enzymes and creatinine was detected in laboratory investigations at emergency room. The patient hospitalized and followed with initial diagnosis of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF). Further investigation of the serum samples at the Refik Saydam Hygiene Center and Research Laboratory of Virology with indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) ((Hantaviruses Mosaic- 1, Euroimmun, Germany) resulted in weakly positivity of anti-hantavirus IgM and IgG. The first serum samples revealed negative by immunoblot test (Euroimmun, Germany). After 11 days second sample of patient revealed DOBV positivite with both IFA and immunoblot serologically.

40|$|Hantaviruses are {{zoonotic}} pathogens {{that maintain}} a persistent infection in their reservoir hosts, yet the mechanisms mediating persistence remain unknown. Regulatory T cell responses cause persistent infection by suppressing proinflammatory and effector T cell activity; hantaviruses may exploit these responses to cause persistence. To test this hypothesis, male Norway rats were inoculated with <b>Seoul</b> <b>virus</b> and regulatory T cells were monitored during infection. Increased numbers of CD 4 +CD 25 +Forkhead box P 3 + T cells and expression of Forkhead box P 3 and TGF-β {{were observed in}} the lungs of male rats during persistent <b>Seoul</b> <b>virus</b> infection. To determine whether regulatory T cells modulate <b>Seoul</b> <b>virus</b> persistence, regulatory T cells were inactivated in male rats by using an anti-rat CD 25 monoclonal antibody (NDS- 63). Inactivation of regulatory T cells reduced the amount of <b>Seoul</b> <b>virus</b> RNA present in the lungs {{and the proportion of}} animals shedding viral RNA in saliva. Because regulatory T cells suppress proinflammatory-induced pathogenesis, pathologic observations in the lungs were evaluated during infection. Subclinical acute multifocal areas of hemorrhage and edema were noted in the lungs during infection; inactivation of regulatory T cells reduced the amount of pathologic foci. Expression of TNF was suppressed during the persistent phase of infection; inactivation of regulatory T cells eliminated the suppression of TNF. Taken together, these data suggest that regulatory T cells mediate <b>Seoul</b> <b>virus</b> persistence, possibly through elevated transcription and synthesis of TGF-β and suppression of TNF. These data provide evidence of regulatory T cell involvement in the persistence of a zoonotic pathogen in its natural reservoir host...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{antigenic}} {{and genetic}} properties of 46 hantaviruses from China, 13 from patients, 23 from rodents, and 10 from unknown hosts, {{were compared with}} those of other hantaviruses. The viruses were classified as either Hantaan (HTN) or <b>Seoul</b> (SEO) <b>viruses.</b> A phylogenetic analysis of the partial M (300 bp) and S (around 485 bp) genomes of HTN viruses identified nine distinct genetic subtypes, one consisting of isolates from Korea. The SEO viruses were divided into five genetic subtypes, although they had less variability than the HTN subtypes. There was a correlation between the subtype and province of origin for four subtypes of HTN viruses, confirming geographical clustering. Hantaan virus NC 167 isolated from Niviventer confucianus and SEO virus Gou 3 isolated from Rattus rattus were the basal clades in each virus. The phylogenetic trees constructed from the entire S and M segments suggested that NC 167 was introduced to N. confucianus in a host-switching event. The reactivity of a panel of 35 monoclonal antibodies was almost exactly the same in NC 167 and a representative HTN virus and in Gou 3 and a representative SEO virus. However, there was a one-way cross-neutralization between them. These results confirm the varied nature of Murinae-associated hantaviruses in China...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOld world hantaviruses, causing {{hemorrhagic fever}} with renal {{syndrome}} (HFRS), still present {{a public health}} problem in Asia and Eastern Europe. The majority of cases has been recorded in China. The aim of our study was to generate human recombinant neutralizing antibodies to a hantavirus by phage display technology. To preserve the structural identity of viral protein, the panning procedure was performed on native Hantaan (HTN) (76 - 118) virus propagated in Vero-E 6 cells. In total, five complete human recombinant IgG antibodies were produced in a baculovirus expression system. All of them were able to completely neutralize HTN, and <b>Seoul</b> (SEO) <b>virus</b> in a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Three of these antibodies could also completely neutralize Dobrava (DOB) virus but not Puumala (PUU) virus. All antibodies bind to Hantaan virus G 2 protein localized in the virus envelope. The sequence areas within the HTN (76 - 118) -G 2 protein detected by five selected antibodies were mapped using peptide scans. Two partial epitopes, 916 -KVMATIDSF- 924 and 954 -LVTKDIDFD- 963, were recognized, which presumably are of paramount importance for docking of the virus to host cell receptors. A consensus motif 916 -KVXATIXSF- 924 could be identified by mutational analysis.

40|$|<b>Seoul</b> (SEO) <b>viruses</b> {{belong to}} the Hantavirus genus (family Bunyaviridae), cause the {{moderate}} form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, and {{have been associated with}} laboratory-acquired infections in many countries. To investigate the pedigree of an isolate, designated IR 461, which was obtained from a laboratory-acquired infection in a UK research institute, we determined the nucleotide sequences of the small (S) and medium (M) genome segments. In addition, we determined the sequences of the S segments of two Chinese isolates (R 22 and L 99) and an American isolate (Tchoupitoulas [TCH]). The S segments range within 1769 – 1785 nucleotides in length and showed identities of &# 62; 88 % in nucleotide sequence and 97 % in amino acid sequence to those of published S segment sequences. The M RNA segment of IR 461 is 3651 nucleotides long and shows &# 62; 84 % identity at the nucleotide level and &# 62; 98 % at the amino acid level to the M segments of other SEO viruses. These data confirm that SEO viruses show the least diversity within the Hantavirus genus. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences showed geographic clustering of the Chinese SEO viruses, and that IR 461 was more closely related to SEO viruses isolated in the New World than to those from the Far East.

Serum samples were tested for immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against Sin Nombre virus N antigen by strip immunoblot assay against Sin Nombre, Puumala, Río Mamoré, and Seoul N antigens. Samples from six patients were positive for IgG antibodies reactive with Andes virus; all patients lived in the Andes Mountains. Foresting was also associated with seropositivity; but not sex, age, race, rodent exposure, or farming activities. Exposure to hantavirus varies in different communities of IX Region. Absence of history of pneumonia or hospital admission in persons with specific IgG antibodies suggests that infection is clinically inapparent. Hantaviruses, RNA-containing viruses, compose a genus within the family Bunyaviridae. The natural reservoirs of the pathogenic New World hantaviruses are rodents of the family Muridae, subfamily Sigmodontinae, in which a chronic and asymptomatic infection develops (1). Hantavirus is a zoonosis transmitted from rodents to humans by inhaling contaminated aerosols from feces, urine, and saliva of infected mice (2). Human infection with hantaviruses have been associated with two diseases. One is the hemorrhagic fever with a renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by Hantaan, Puumala, <b>Seoul,</b> and Dobrava/Belgrade <b>viruses,</b> first recognized during the Korean War in 1950 to 1953.

40|$|Abstract. In rodent populations, {{males are}} more likely to be {{infected}} with hantaviruses and to engage in aggression than are females.

In contrast, neither age nor wounding predicted virus shedding among females. Although viral antigen was not identified in the brain, viral protein was detected in the gonads and adrenal glands of adult males.

40|$|Hantaviruses are a {{group of}} rodent-borne viruses. Seoul {{hantavirus}} {{is considered to be}} the only global hantavirus, although reported human cases outside of Asia are rare. Human infection occurs when breathing in aerosols of excreta from infected rodents.

In the UK, historically, there was evidence for human and animal exposure to hantaviruses demonstrated by the detection of specific antibodies and classic renal disease, however it is only during this study that existence of a UK hantavirus in wild rodent populations has been proven. Since 2012, several cases of acute AKI due to hantavirus infection in the UK have been confirmed. Two cases were from Yorkshire and had documented exposure to wild rats. Wild rodents were trapped from the farm belonging to one of the patient’s and a strain of <b>Seoul</b> <b>virus,</b> named Humber virus, was isolated from rats.
