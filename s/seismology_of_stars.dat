40|$|<b>Seismology</b> <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> is {{strongly}} developing. To address this question we have formed an international collaboration OPAC to perform specific experimental measurements, compare opacity calculations {{and improve the}} opacity calculations in the stellar codes [1]. We consider the following opacity codes: SCO, CASSANDRA, STA, OPAS, LEDCOP, OP, SCO-RCG. Their comparison has shown large differences for Fe and Ni in equivalent conditions of envelopes of type II supernova precursors, temperatures between 15 and 40 eV and densities of a few mg/cm 3 [2, 3, 4]. LEDCOP, OPAS, SCO-RCG structure codes and STA give similar results and differ from OP ones for the lower temperatures and for spectral interval values [3]. In this work we discuss the role of Configuration Interaction (CI) {{and the influence of}} the number of used configurations. We present and include in the opacity code comparisons new HULLAC-v 9 calculations [5, 6] that include full CI. To illustrate the importance of this effect we compare different CI approximations (modes) available in HULLAC-v 9 [7]. These results are compared to previous predictions and to experimental data. Differences with OP results are discussed.

40|$|We are {{reaching}} relative maturity and standardization in one-dimensional single-star stellar evolution and pulsation modeling, and are making advances in binary and 2 D and 3 D models. However, many physical inputs are still uncertain or neglected in {{models of the}} Sun and of other stars. Thanks to the the Kepler, CoRoT, and MOST spacecraft, for example, {{as well as to}} ground-based networks, we now have pulsation data for stars that are of comparable quality to that for the Sun to constrain models and test physical assumptions. Here I will focus on main sequence (core H-burning) or slightly post-main sequence (shell H-burning) stellar models, and some of the unsolved problems for these stars. I will revisit the solar abundance problem, and show the effects of modified electron screening, dark matter, and early mass loss on solar models. I will discuss the gamma Dor/ delta Sct hybrid stars, the mismatch between predicted and observed frequencies for delta Sct stars, and how <b>seismology</b> <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> more massive than the Sun, e. g. the brightest Kepler target theta Cyg, could help us constrain physical processes such as diffusive settling, test pulsation driving mechanisms, and provide clues to the solar abundance problem.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{show how the}} {{formalism}} of Wu & Goldreich developed for weakly nonlinear white dwarf pulsations can be extended to the fully nonlinear case. Due to the computational simplification this affords over the simulations of Brickhill (1992 a) and Ising & Koester (2001), {{we are able to}} obtain the first ever fits of observed light curves. These fits allow us to obtain not only mode identifications but also to constrain the average depth of the convection zone and its sensitivity to changes in Teff.

40|$|Abstract. The {{photometric}} {{experiment on}} Hipparcos {{has led to}} the discovery of, among other types of variables, a large amount of new Slowly Pulsating B Stars. We have selected twelve bright southern <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> this sample, together with five previously known Slowly Pulsating B Stars, for spectroscopic and photometric monitoring.

We here present the results of a preliminary analysis of our data and show that our sample is an extremely important one to perform <b>seismology</b> <b>of</b> intermediate-massive <b>stars.</b> In particular, we find that all but one <b>of</b> the selected <b>stars</b> exhibit clear line-profile variability. The broader-lined Slowly Pulsating B Stars tend to have more complex line-profile variations. One of the previously known Slowly Pulsating B stars was known to be a binary. Besides this <b>star,</b> another six <b>of</b> the selected Slowly Pulsating B stars turn out to be multiple systems.

40|$|A new non-perturbative {{method to}} compute {{accurate}} oscillation modes in rapidly rotating stars is presented. In this paper, {{the effect of}} the centrifugal force is fully taken into account while the Coriolis force is neglected. This assumption is valid when the time scale of the oscillation is much shorter than the inverse of the rotation rate and is expected to be suitable for high radial order p-modes <b>of</b> δ Scuti <b>stars.</b> Axisymmetric p-modes have been computed in uniformly rotating polytropic models <b>of</b> <b>stars.</b> In the frequency and rotation range considered, we found that as rotation increases (i) the asymptotic structure of the non-rotating frequency spectrum is first destroyed then replaced by a new form of organization (ii) the mode amplitude tends to concentrate near the equator (iii) differences with perturbative methods become significant as soon as the rotation rate exceeds about fifteen percent of the Keplerian limit.

40|$|Context. The <b>seismology</b> <b>of</b> early-type <b>stars</b> {{is limited}} by our {{incomplete}} understanding of gravito-inertial modes. Aims. We develop a short-wavelength asymptotic analysis for gravito-inertial modes in rotating stars. Methods. The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation {{was applied to the}} equations governing adiabatic small perturbations about a model of a uniformly rotating barotropic star. Results. A general eikonal equation, including the effect of the centrifugal deformation, is derived. The dynamics of axisymmetric gravito-inertial rays is solved numerically for polytropic stellar models of increasing rotation and analysed by describing the structure of the phase space. Three different types of phase-space structures are distinguished. The first type results from the continuous evolution of structures of the non-rotating integrable phase space. It is predominant in the low-frequency part of the phase space. The second type of structures are island chains associated with stable periodic rays. The third type of structures are large chaotic regions that can be related to the envelope minimum of the Brunt-Väisälä frequency. Conclusions. Gravito-inertial modes are expected to follow this classification, in which the frequency spectrum is a superposition of sub-spectra associated with these different types of phase-space structures. The detailed confrontation between the predictions of this ray-based asymptotic theory and numerically computed modes will be presented in a companion paper.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} here {{a representative}} set <b>of</b> δ Scuti <b>stars</b> {{observed in the}} Praesepe cluster, thanks to recent efforts of multi-site networks. We show {{that the effect of}} rotation on the determination of fundamental parameters Mbol and Teff cannot be neglected when modelling fast rotators as δ Scuti stars. We propose a method to take this effect into account and gain some indication on the rotation rate <b>of</b> the <b>stars.</b> We then use this unique homogeneous set of observational data to investigate the pulsational behaviour <b>of</b> δ Scuti <b>stars</b> for different masses, corresponding to different evolutionary stages at the age of the Praesepe cluster. We propose here an alternative approach to <b>seismology</b> <b>of</b> δ Scuti <b>stars,</b> trying to avoid specific but questionable mode identifications. Via a large set of models, we compare the observed modes with the unstable modes as obtained from a linear stability analysis including a nonlocal time-dependent treatment of convection. We show that, in the framework of the linear analysis adopted here, a satisfying agreement can be reached between the predicted ranges of unstable modes and the ranges derived from observations. However we found that for “low-mass ” δ Scuti stars (1. 6 - 1. 80 M⊙) the agreement is found only for a restricted range of values of the mixing length parameter. These stars thus bring a valuable observational constraint on the description of the convection in the outer layers <b>of</b> <b>stars...</b>|$|R
