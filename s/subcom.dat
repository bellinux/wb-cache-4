40|$|Single-mode silica {{fibers and}} erbium doped fiber {{amplifiers}} {{have been the}} cornerstone of optical communications for decades, but they are now approaching fundamental limits. This workshop aims to look well beyond the immediate short-term horizon and will discuss the need for and potential of more radically new forms of optical fibers and amplifiers. The workshop will bring together fiber and amplifier end-users and manufacturers, glass scientists and network operators to exchange views on the projected requirements for future communications systems and on the anticipated capabilities of alternative fiber and amplifier technologies. Is a gradual evolution of the current technology still possible or is a revolution required at some point? Are there potentially breakthrough technologies that could enable radical cost savings and energy efficient capacity growth? What if not? Blue sky thinking will be actively encouraged.

40|$|In April 2006 several dive {{inspections}} {{were executed}} along the intended {{route of the}} Norned HV DC Electrical Cable between The Netherlands and Norway. These visual underwater inspections are {{the second phase of}} the archaeological assessment of the route, or MIVO 2 (Maritiem Inventariserend Veld Onderzoek or Maritime Archaeological Field Assessment). The purpose of these inspections was to establish the possible archaeological value of observed phenomena on the seabed, which were determined from several hydrographic and geophysical data sets. A total of 5 locations were eventually chosen in collaboration with RACM (former ROB: Rijksdienst voor Oudheidkundig Bodemonderzoek or the Dutch Archaeological Survey) based on the assessment of hydrographic and geophysical datasets. The visual underwater inspections were carried out by <b>Subcom</b> BV from Zierikzee under supervision of Periplus Archeomare BV. On one of the locations the remnants of a large historic shipwreck was discovered, dated at around 1667. After the discovery of this shipwreck, ARC from Groningen carried out the archaeological assessment of the recovered parts of the wreck. Although located at about 15 meters from the intended cable route, the extent of the wreck location did not interfere with the general cable laying operations. Therefore no deviation form this route was deemed necessary and laying operations could be carried out as planned. Phenomena on other locations did not reveal any further archaeological values...|$|E
40|$|Between Norway and The Netherlands, a {{high-voltage}} {{power cable}} (NorNed) is planned and realised by Norwegian Statnett SF and Dutch TenneT TSO BV. Periplus Archeomare BV {{carried out a}} side-scan sonar survey of {{the bottom of the}} eastern Wadden sea. As a result of this survey, a small number of locations was selected for further investigation. The main aim was to determine the archaelogical potential of these locations. At a distance of 29 meters from the proposed route of the electricity cable, a shipwreck was discovered on location D 1. On the 19 th, 20 th and 21 st of April, 2006, Archaeological Research & Consultancy (ARC bv), Groningen, participated in investigating the potentially interesting locations, D 1, D 2 and D 5, by a diving-unit, carried out by <b>Subcom</b> BV and managed by Periplus Archeomare BV. On behalf of ARC bv drs. C. G. Koopstra and mw. drs. J. B. Hielkema, both senior archaeologists, participated in the fieldwork. The finds from location D 1, consisting of wooden samples from the wreck and a human bone, were studied by drs. ing. G. J. de Roller and mw. drs. G. M. A. Bergsma. Prof. dr. H. R. Reinders, Groninger Institute of Archaeology (RUG) and drs. W. Kerkmeijer, head collection and conservator of the Noordelijk Scheepvaartmuseum, Groningen, were so kind as to provide additional information about shipwrecks in general, including their archaeological potention. Near the Eemshaven a shipwreck was discovered, that dates from {{the latter part of the}} 17 th century. Dendrochronological dating of wood from this ship indicates that the ship was built after 1667 AD. The relatively huge size of the planks and beams indicate that it may be a large seafaring ship. The remains that are still embedded in the clay, are well preserved. The parts of the ship that are exposed, however, are afflicted by shipworm, white paddock and probably other sea-organisms. This means that erosion of the ship will continue, unless some action is undertaken to consolidate the condition of the shipwreck...|$|E
