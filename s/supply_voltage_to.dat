2500|$|Ballast {{was also}} a {{component}} used in early model automobiles engine [...] that lowered the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> the ignition system after the engine had been started. Starting the engine requires {{a significant amount of}} electrical current from the battery, resulting in an equally significant voltage drop. To allow the engine to start, the ignition system was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once the vehicle was started and the starter disengaged, the normal operating voltage was too high for the ignition system. To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the ignition system, resulting in two different operating voltages for the starting and ignition systems.|$|E

50|$|A voltage {{regulator}} module (VRM), sometimes called processor power module (PPM), is a buck converter {{that provides a}} microprocessor the appropriate supply voltage, converting +5 V or +12 V to a much lower voltage required by the CPU, allowing processors with different <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> be mounted on the same motherboard.|$|E
50|$|Loss from {{subthreshold}} leakage can {{be reduced}} by raising the threshold voltage and lowering the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage.</b> Both these changes slowdown the circuit significantly. To address this issue, some modern low-power circuits use dual <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> <b>to</b> improve speed on critical paths of the circuit and lower power-consumption on non-critical paths. Some circuits even use different transistors (with different threshold voltages) {{in different parts of}} the circuit, in an attempt to further reduce power consumption without significant performance loss.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{increase}} in power consumption due to interconnects and {{the variation in}} delays (delay spread) among long interconnects are becoming important issues for design of high performance and low power circuits in scaled technologies. In this paper we propose an adaptive <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> technique for low swing interconnects. The proposed technique assigns different <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> <b>to</b> drive interconnects based on their delay. The voltage assignment is done only once during the initialization period of the circuit. Hence, there is no extra power consumption in the active mode. We also {{show that there is}} an optimum number of <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> required <b>to</b> achieve maximum power saving. Simulation results show that for a set of 64 buses we can achieve 42. 8 % and 55. 9 % reductions in the power consumption and delay spread, respectively. I...|$|R

50|$|Some voltage {{regulators}} provide a fixed <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> the processor, {{but most of}} them sense the required supply voltage from the processor, essentially acting as a continuously-variable adjustable regulator. In particular, VRMs that are soldered to the motherboard are supposed to do the sensing, according to the Intel specification.|$|E
50|$|The {{electronics}} industry, {{particularly in}} portable and mobile devices, continually strives to lower <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> save power and reduce emitted electromagnetic radiation. A low supply voltage, however, reduces noise immunity. Differential signaling helps to reduce these problems because, {{for a given}} supply voltage, it provides twice the noise immunity of a single-ended system.|$|E
5000|$|Conversely, all circuit elements, even [...] "linear" [...] elements, show {{nonlinearity}} as {{the signal}} level is increased. If nothing else, the power <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> the circuit usually puts {{a limit on}} the magnitude of voltage output from a circuit. Above that limit, the output ceases to scale in magnitude with the input, failing the definition of linearity.|$|E
50|$|Brownout {{detection}} solves most {{of those}} problems in most systems by causing the system to shut down when mains power is unreliable. One typical system retriggers a timer each time that the AC main voltage exceeds 90% of its rated voltage. If the timer expires, it interrupts the microcontroller, which then shuts down its system. Many systems also measure the power <b>supply</b> <b>voltages,</b> <b>to</b> guard against slow power supply degradation.|$|R

50|$|More {{complex logic}} {{functions}} such as those involving AND and OR gates require manipulating the paths between gates to represent the logic. When a path consists of two transistors in series, both transistors must have low resistance to the corresponding supply voltage, modelling an AND.

50|$|The correct {{supply voltage}} is communicated by the {{microprocessor}} to the VRM at startup via {{a number of}} bits called VID (voltage identification). In particular, the VRM initially provides a standard <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> the VID logic, which {{is the part of}} the processor whose only aim is to then send the VID to the VRM.

5000|$|The TTL [...] "totem-pole" [...] output {{structure}} {{often has}} a momentary overlap when both {{the upper and}} lower transistors are conducting, resulting in a substantial pulse of current drawn from the power supply. These pulses can couple in unexpected ways between multiple integrated circuit packages, resulting in reduced noise margin and lower performance. TTL systems usually have a decoupling capacitor for every one or two IC packages, so that a current pulse from one TTL chip does not momentarily reduce the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> another.|$|E
