5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

In November, both he and Salem al-Hazmi flew to Beirut, though on separate flights and at different times. Ghamdi flew on the same flight as a senior Hezbollah operative, although the 9/11 Commission could find no evidence that either knew the other. His family claims to have last <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> December.|$|E
25|$|Olaus {{accompanied}} his mentor, Bishop Gregersson, to Stockholm {{and attended}} the tumultuous crowning of Danish King Christian II, who had captured Stockholm {{and held it}} {{for about a year}} until returning to Denmark, where he was soon deposed and replaced by his uncle, who became King Frederick I of Denmark. Meanwhile, at the notorious Stockholm Bloodbath in early November, King Christian violated his promises of a general amnesty for the Sture party, and during the post-coronation festivities arrested and executed 80-90 churchmen and secular Swedish nobles, including Bishop Gregersson. When Olaus expressed his outrage, he was almost executed as well, but a German who had <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Wittenberg identified Olaus as a fellow German and thus saved his life. King Christian tried to appoint his friend, Odense's bishop Jens Andersen Beldenak, to the now-vacant Strängnäs bishopric, but both Danes soon returned to Denmark, and the scholar-priest Laurentius Andreae, who had been named archdeacon in 1520, ran the diocese.|$|E

25|$|Martínez Salinas, on {{the other}} hand, stated that {{he was forced to}} confess because he was a {{neighbor}} at Santa Elena and driver of the Hernández family. He said he had been beaten and taken to the ranch where he was told to pose with the exhumed bodies. When asked if he had ever met Constanzo, he stated that he had <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> person at the ranch with the Hernándezes but never talked to him. Martínez Salinas said he was arrested one afternoon at Elio's in-law's house when {{he was looking for a}} car piece for his vehicle. He said he had known Aldrete years before, since he had dated one of her sisters when he was young. He said that he had never heard Aldrete talk about the cult. He said she had talked about her school and marriage. He also said that Elio and Ovidio never invited him to the cult or talked to him about it.|$|E
25|$|The {{main story}} {{leading up to}} the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was the health of the England vice-captain Denis Compton. His famously damaged knee had swollen up after making another century – 115 vs an Australian XI – and hourly bulletins were posted by the MCC manager Brigadier Michael Green expressing optimistically that he would play in order to help draw a large crowd for the Test, though doubts where express by those who had <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> the end he was unfit to play and was {{replaced}} by the Welsh amateur batsmen Gilbert Parkhouse who had made 58 in the Australian XI game, adding 130 with the luckless Compton. The reserve wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre was also dropped from his batting role and the teenaged Brian Close was brought in as the best of a bad bunch, having hit 105 not out against long hops and full tosses served up in a minor game. Brown thought that if nothing else as an all-rounder he could help take some of the strain off the other bowlers and so Close became the youngest Englishman to play Australia in a Test. Australia made only one change, dropping Jack Moroney for having made a pair in the First Test. His successor was chosen in the Australian XI game and opener Ken Archer (12th man at Brisbane) was given his Baggy Green ahead of the middle order batsman Jim Burke (who was made 12th man), although he had only made 81 to Burke's 128. Lindsay Hassett won the toss and batted first on a yellow, matted wicket made for batting.|$|E

Who has <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> any of his disguises and has failed to laugh?" [...] Max Beerbohm later said of Leno's death: [...] "So little and frail a lantern could not long harbour so big a flame".|$|E

Eddy stayed with her for two months, giving Jarvis mental healing to ease a breathing problem, and writing to Quimby six times for absent treatment for herself. She called the latter [...] "angel visits"; {{in one of her}} letters to Quimby, she said that she had <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> her room. In April she gave a public lecture in Warren, contrasting mental healing with Spiritualism, entitled: [...] "P. P. Quimby's Spiritual Science healing disease, as opposed to Deism or Rochester Rapping Spiritualism." ...|$|E

When Dussander has a heart attack, he calls Todd, who {{finishes}} the job, cleans up, and calls an ambulance for Dussander. At the hospital, Dussander is recognized by a death camp survivor sharing his room and he is arrested, prior to being extradited to Israel. Todd graduates as his school's valedictorian and gives a speech about Icarus, saying, [...] "All great achievements arose from dissatisfaction. It is the desire to do better, to dig deeper, that propels civilization to greatness." [...] The scene is juxtaposed in a montage with Dussander's home being searched and the hobo's corpse being found in the basement.|$|E
500|$|Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin, {{a cynical}} red dwarf. Dinklage was Adamson and Johnson's first choice, having <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> The Station Agent. He {{accepted}} because [...] "often, {{you get the}} hero and the villain and not much in between. Trumpkin is in between. He is not a lovable Snow White dwarf. Audiences appreciate these cynical characters. It helps parents and adults {{to go along with}} the journey." [...] Dinklage's prosthetics took three hours to apply, and restricted his performance to his eyes. Even his frown was built into the make-up. On his first day of filming, he was bitten by sand flies and fell into a river. [...] "We were lucky that he returned after his first day!" [...] recalled Johnson.|$|E

500|$|Milk drifted from California to Texas to New York, {{without a}} steady job or plan. In New York City he became {{involved}} with O'Horgan's theater company as a [...] "general aide", signing on as associate producer for Lenny and for Eve Merriam's Inner City. The time he had spent with the cast of flower children wore away much of Milk's conservatism. A contemporary New York Times story about O'Horgan described Milk as [...] "a sad eyed man—another aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads". Craig Rodwell read {{the description of the}} formerly uptight man and wondered if it could be the same person. One of Milk's Wall Street friends worried that he seemed to have no plan or future, but remembered Milk's attitude: [...] "I think he was happier than at any time I had ever <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> his entire life." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{element of}} delusion permeated his thinking: Bundy was always surprised when anyone noticed {{that one of}} his victims was missing, because he imagined America to be a place where everyone is invisible except to themselves. And he was always astounded when people testified that they had <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> incriminating places, because Bundy did not believe people noticed each other. [...] "I don't know why everyone is out to get me", he complained to Lewis. [...] "He really and truly did not have any sense of the enormity of what he had done," [...] she said. [...] "A long-term serial killer erects powerful barriers to his guilt," [...] Keppel wrote, [...] "walls of denial that can sometimes never be breached." [...] Nelson agreed. [...] "Each time he was forced to make an actual confession," [...] she wrote, [...] "he had to leap a steep barrier he had built inside himself long ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Ede Teller {{was born}} on January 15, 1908, in Budapest, Hungary (then part of Austria-Hungary), into a Jewish family. His parents were Ilona (born Deutsch), a pianist, and Max Teller, an attorney. He later became an agnostic. [...] "Religion {{was not an issue}} in my family", he later wrote, [...] "indeed, it was never discussed. My only {{religious}} training came because the Minta required that all students take classes in their respective religions. My family celebrated one holiday, the Day of Atonement, when we all fasted. Yet my father said prayers for his parents on Saturdays and on all the Jewish holidays. The idea of God that I absorbed was that it would be wonderful if He existed: We needed Him desperately but had not <b>seen</b> <b>Him</b> <b>in</b> many thousands of years." [...] Like Einstein and Feynman, Teller was a late talker. He developed the ability to speak later than most children but became very interested in numbers, and would calculate large numbers in his head for fun.|$|E

500|$|Kinsler {{was then}} drafted {{a third time}} by the Texas Rangers in the 17th round (496th overall) in 2003 as a shortstop {{at the urging of}} area scout Mike Grouse. Grouse liked Kinsler's tools, makeup, desire, and gritty approach. In Grouse's {{scouting}} report, he wrote that Kinsler had a great feel for the game, athleticism, solid defensive skills, intensity, and leadership qualities. Grouse knew that Kinsler was probably being underrated by rival scouts who did not know that Kinsler had played with a foot stress fracture while at Missouri, [...] "so [...] really couldn't run like I knew he could. I'd <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Wichita the year before, so I knew he was a plus runner. Most people ... didn't know that, so they probably downgraded him. But I knew it, and I wasn't telling anybody." [...] Kinsler, for his part, says: [...] "I thought I was a lot better than a 17th round pick. I thought I belonged in the top 10 rounds." [...] Kinsler nonetheless agreed to sign with the Rangers on his 21st birthday, for $30,000.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bathurst was {{appearing}} in The Rover during casting {{and arrived at}} his audition [...] "bearded and shaggy".

Langan had <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Joking Apart and some other sitcom pilots and was attracted to his [...] "disciplined comic energy". Hermione Norris first read for Rachel but Lowney asked her to read for Karen because her social class matched that of the character, and she had a good rapport with Bathurst. Other actors appearing are Mark Andrews as Howard, Mark Crowshaw as the waiter, John Griffin as Andrew, David Harewood as the Police Sergeant, Kathryn Hunt as Pru, Pauline Jefferson as the Old Lady, Jeremy Turner-Welch as the Neighbour, and Lewis Hancock as the Evangelist. Mike Bullen makes a cameo appearance as the actor. Bullen insisted on having a line as when he visited the set of The Perfect Match he [...] "felt like a spare part".|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{a medical}} {{convention}} in New Orleans, after graduating medical school, Wilson accidentally broke an antique mirror {{and started a}} bar fight when another customer repeatedly played [...] "Leave A Tender Moment Alone" [...] by Billy Joel to the frustration of Wilson, who {{was going through a}} divorce with his first wife at the time. House met him in jail and, motivated by a desire for companionship and by sheer boredom, bailed him out and hired an attorney to clear his name, thus starting their professional and personal relationship. In the Season 1 episode [...] "Histories", it is revealed that one of his brothers is homeless and that Wilson is unaware if he is still alive as he has not <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> nine years. Wilson has a history of failed marriages: he is married to his third wife during Season 1 and, with the discovery of his wife's infidelity, separates from her during Season 2. After the failure of his third marriage, Wilson lives in various temporary accommodations (including a stint at House's own apartment) until he meets Amber Volakis, who is a female substitute for House. He is described as [...] "nearly 40" [...] in [...] "Don't Ever Change", in Season 4, {{and by the end of}} Season 8, House describes him during a semi-mock DDx as a [...] "46-year-old oncologist". Wilson and House's relationship has been sorely tested on many occasions.|$|E

500|$|The Billboard {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review for its moving story of true love {{shown by the}} actors playing the blind wife and facially disfigured husband. The reviewer {{also noted that the}} photography was up to the usual high standard of Thanhouser releases. The Moving Picture World opened with the declaration that, [...] "When this picture is past, the wonder will linger long in the memory whether the wife would have loved her husband just the same if she had <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the short time when her affliction was alleviated. And it must be admitted that the producers have added materially to the dramatic interest of the film by leaving that question unanswered." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror review praised the film for its photography, setting and acting, but highlighted technical inconsistencies in the progression of the fire and the overly drawn out struggle of the father in the smoke. Walton of The Moving Picture News also praised the film, stating that [...] "The situations are well handled; the acting of the principals shows the true grip of the characters. The work of this firm of late has been not only artistic but throbbing with that clean, human life which is winning high praise." [...] In local papers, the film was reviewed positively by theater advertisements, owing to the sentimental nature of the film and the technical execution of the fire scene.|$|E
500|$|... "Redux" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, awarded {{the first episode}} a C+ rating and wrote that [...] "'Redux ' {{was a pretty good}} episode back in 1997. It’s not a very good episode now". VanDerWerff noted that the idea that Mulder had killed himself was not effective because the show's audience knew that a movie had been scheduled for release in the summer of 1998. Finally, he called the episode's ending [...] "one of the show’s weaker cliffhangers". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave {{the first part of the}} episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She heavily criticized the story's pacing, noting that the episode [...] "is all plot, plot, plot. [...] much of the plot is unbelievable." [...] Furthermore, Vitaris criticized several plot holes in the episode, including Mulder's easy entrance into the Department of Defense and the characters antics, such as his attack of Ostelhoff. However, despite the overall negative review, Vitaris did mention that, [...] "There's only one truly galvanizing scene, as that's the confrontation between Scully and Skinner after he follows her to the lab where she is performing her DNA test." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two heavily criticized the [...] "Skinner-as-traitor" [...] plot, noting sardonically that [...] "the production team aren't going to do , and the shock 'villain in the room' reveal will be Section Chief Blevins–a character so important in the framework of the series that, barring his appearance in the Season Four finale, we haven't <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> ninety-four episodes." [...] Not all reviews were so negative. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files named [...] "Redux" [...] and [...] "Redux II", together, as the tenth best [...] "Episode of All Time". In his critique of [...] "Redux", he noted [...] "While many people don't care for 'Redux', I think it does a good job of preparing us for the second hour (although, it invalidates Gillian's emotional context from the S4 finale)." [...] In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Redux" [...] (along with [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and [...] "Redux II") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E
