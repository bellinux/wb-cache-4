Laccase treatments of cellulose fibres with lauryl gallate conferred the lowest level of water penetration in handsheets. It was observed that the hydrophobization of paper was not possible using the hidrophobe alone. The coupling of lauryl gallate onto cellulose fibres was firstly denoted by kappa number analysis, and further demonstrated by IR spectroscopy.

40|$|A new biotechnological {{procedure}} using laccase {{in combination}} with a hydrophobic phenolic compound (lauryl gallate) for the hydrophobization of cellulose fibres and internal <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> was developed. Cellulose fibres from hardwood kraft pulp were incubated with laccase (Lac), {{in combination with}} lauryl gallate (LG). The Lac-LG treatment resulted in the internal <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> and also in significantly reduced water penetration in the handsheets and wettability of the paper surface.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The effect <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> {{sludge content}} and size on the processibility, {{mechanical}} properties, swelling behavior and morphology of PP–EPDM composites were examined. Results {{show that the}} increasing content <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> sludge in composites has increased the Young’s modulus and water absorption but decreased the tensile strength and elongation at break. At a similar filler content, PP–EPDM composites with the smallest size show the highest mechanical properties but the lowest water absorption resistance. SEM tensile fracture surface of composites show that the smallest <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> sludge has better filler–matrix interaction than the larger <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> sludge.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop an {{innovative}} method for the internal <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> by use of laccase and hydrophobic compounds. Nine different products containing hydrophobic moieties were tested in combination with laccase derived from Trametes villosa on Eucalyptus globulus kraft pulp {{in order to assess}} their internal sizing capability. The strongest internal sizing effect was obtained with lauryl gallate (LG). Heat treatment of the handsheets was found to increase the resistance to water absorption of internally sized samples significantly. Tests were conducted under variable operating conditions, including enzyme and reactant doses and treatment time. In addition to altering the water absorption rate, internal sizing with the laccase–LG treatments was found to affect the mechanical and optical properties of the handsheets. As shown in this work, treatments based on laccase and a hydrophobic compound (particularly lauryl gallate), can provide a new, effective biotechnological method for the internal <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Optimization of ASA {{emulsification}} {{in internal}} <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> and board In paper- and boardmaking, internal sizing {{is used for}} making the end product more resistant to liquid penetration. Rosin, Alkyl Ketene Dimer (AKD) and Alkenyl Succinic Anhydride (ASA) internal sizing agents exist for this purpose. ASA {{is added to the}} papermaking process {{in the form of an}} emulsion. The dispersion of ASA oil, water, and a stabilizing agent (stabilizer) are mixed under shear forces to create the emulsion. In this master’s thesis, different emulsions, emulsification techniques and stabilizers in the process industry were studied. Emulsions in food, medical, petroleum and papermaking processes had potential stabilizers to be used for hydrophobation of paper and board with ASA. The comparison between rosin, AKD and ASA internal sizing agents was also done. The goal was to find optimal emulsification methods and emulsion stabilizers for ASA emulsification. The effect of different ASA compounds, one pure ASA and the other, easy emulsifying (EE-ASA), with surface active agents (surfactants) added, were examined with various emulsion stabilizers. Emulsification process of ASA was studied by choosing thirty four stabilizers based on earlier experiments and literature over various fields of emulsification. The chosen stabilizers were reference cationic potato starch, different charge densities and molecular weights having cationic and anionic polyacrylamides (C- and A-PAM's), caboxymethyl celluloses (cmc's) and amphoteric polymers, among other stabilizers which gave steric or electrostatic stabilization effect on emulsio...|$|E
40|$|Surface <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> by {{anionic starch}} {{were carried out}} {{with the aim of}} its {{concentration}} effect on physical and strength properties of recycled paper. For this, hand sheets (100 GSM) of mixed recycled pulp containing 1 % cationic starch were prepared and were treated by the sizing agent on the sheet surface at various concentration (0, 3 - 10 %). Application and concentration increment of the starch solution caused its higher retention on the surface and lesser penetration into the paper structure (Z direction), contributed to the better hydrophobicity of sized paper and significantly reduction in water absorption of the paper, with the highest reduction in the Cobb test up to the solution concentration of 5 %. Also, the results revealed that regarding to absorption and its increment into the paper surface combined to penetration to the paper thickness, strength properties of bending stiffness, burst and tensile indices have been increased which the improvement rate were more predominant up to the 5 % cons. Penetration of a part of sizing agent into the porous structure of paper and resulted improvement in fiber bonding are possible and probable, that higher concentration and viscosity of the starch solution contributed to the lesser penetration and bonding formation with higher retention on the paper surface which resulted in continuous improvement in paper smoothness. With the sizing solution thickening, tear index decreased due to starch film formation on the paper surface with brittle character. In general, increasing of the anionic starch solution up to the 5 % could be reported as an optimum level...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 First, a {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis was}} carried out upon a sizing-desizing process. The energetic analysis shows that rosin soap size should be bound to fibers through primary chemical forces such as covalent bonds to effect sizing. Secondary chemical forces are all thermodynamically unstable to the attack of water molecules. It is also shown that the stronger the bonding between size and fibers is, the higher the degree of <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> can be. Then ferric and ferrous ions were investigated as mordants for rosin soap size. While ferric ion at pH 3. 0 to 4. 0 and ferrous ion at pH around 5. 5 are able to induce {{a very high level}} of sizing to unbleached Douglas-fir kraft pulp, they have virtually no effect on bleached Douglas-fir kraft pulp and bleached hardwood chemical pulp. The reason is believed to be due to the difference in lignin content of the unbleached and bleached pulps. Two possible structures of the complex formed between these transition metal ions and lignin are postulated. The excellent sizing results induced by iron ions in mechanical pulp strongly support this hypothesis. Finally, metal ions Mg²⁺, Mn²⁺, Fe²⁺, Fe³⁺, Cu²⁺ and Zn²⁺ are used with polyamines as mordants of rosin soap size. While Mg²⁺/PEI and Mn²⁺/PEI shows no effect and Fe³⁺/PEI is very effective in an acidic pH range, Zn²⁺/PEI can induce moderate sizing and Fe²⁺/PEI and Cu²⁺/PEI can induce very high levels of sizing under neutral to alkaline conditions (up to pH 10 with Cu²⁺ /PEI) in various pulps. The incorporation of polyamines can also greatly improve the sizing efficiency when alum is the mordant. The tensile and bursting strength of the handsheets can also be improved by 20 - 30...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at {{understanding}} and fully characterising the association mechanism of an alternating copolymer in water {{and the effect of}} the association in solution on the conformation of the polymer chains at the air/water interface. Self-assembly is an elegant and efficient method to obtain well defined and usually defect-free nano-architectures. The association, variety of shapes and properties of block copolymers have been extensively studied. The present study led to a precise understanding of the complex behaviour of large molecules. The polymer studied is an alternating copolymer; poly(styrene- alt-maleic anhydride) (SMA). This polymer has various applications ranging from surface <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> to nanotechnology and pharmaceutical applications. The detailed theoretical investigation of the SMA association led to the discovery of a novel way to self-assemble polymer chains, and the prediction and characterisation of a tubular structure formed by this association. The nanotubes are several micrometers long and their conformation shows that the hydrophobic groups are mainly located inside the tube and the hydrophilic groups are mainly on the exterior surface of the tube. The predicted tubular structure of SMA in solution was also confirmed by neutron scattering experiments. This study showed that the tubes interact forming two-dimensional sheets of tubes and higher order structures. In addition, the SMA association {{has been shown to be}} thermally stable. Furthermore, neutron reflectivity experiments were performed on the SMA solution to determine the influence of the association in solution on the conformation of the polymer at the air-water interface. This study revealed an equilibrium between the conformation of the polymer in solution and at the interface. Using the knowledge of the association mechanism obtained from the complete theoretical and experimental characterisation of the association of poly(styrene-maleic anhydride) in water and at the air-water interface, a novel application for the polymer has been developed. This application uses the template formed by the nanotubes to form nanowires of intrinsically conducting polymers. Neutron scattering, neutron reflectivity, cryo-TEM and AFM experimental studies characterised the synthesis of the nanowires...|$|E
