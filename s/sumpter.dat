2500|$|In contradistinction to Dover Wilson and Waith, several {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} whilst the speech may not work on the page, it can work in performance. Discussing the Deborah Warner RSC production at The Swan in 1987, which used an unedited text, Stanley Wells argues that Donald <b>Sumpter's</b> delivery of the speech [...] "became a deeply moving attempt to master the facts and thus to overcome the emotional shock of a previously unimagined horror. We had {{the sense of a}} suspension of time, as if the speech represented an articulation, necessarily extended in expression, of a sequence of thoughts and emotions, that might have taken no more than a second or two to flash through the character's mind, like a bad dream." [...] Also speaking of the Warner production and <b>Sumpter's</b> performance, Alan C. Dessen writes [...] "we observe Marcus, step-by-step, use his logic and Lavinia's reactions to work out what has happened, so that the spectators both see Lavinia directly and see through his eyes and images. In the process the horror of the situation is filtered through a human consciousness in a way difficult to describe but powerful to experience." ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Determine the {{incidence}} {{and severity of}} osteitis in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis using a new Global Osteitis Scoring Scale. Design: Validation and prospective case-control study. Setting: Academic Tertiary Otolaryngology Department (Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam). Participants: A prospective series of 102 patients undergoing a computed tomography (CT) sinuses {{as part of their}} evaluation for chronic rhinosinusitis between January and May 2008 (study group) and an age- and gender-matched control group of 68 non-rhinosinusitis patients. Seventy-eight of the chronic rhinosinusitis patients completed the nasal subset of the RhinoSinusitis Outcome Measure (RSOM- 31) and visual analogue scales. Their CT scans were assessed for osteitis using a newly developed Global Osteitis Scoring Scale. A subsample of 35 scans were additionally scored by a second otolaryngologist and a radiologist. Main outcome measures: Global Osteitis Scoring Scale. Results: The interrater variability of Global Osteitis Scoring Scale was low (average intraclass correlation coefficient: 0. 94). Forty per cent of the chronic rhinosinusitis group and none of the control group had evidence of clinically significant osteitis. In the chronic rhinosinusitis group (102 patients), the severity of osteitis was correlated with Lund-Mackay (L-M) score (P < 0. 001), duration of symptoms (P < 0. 01) and previous surgery (P < 0. 001), rising in incidence with increasing number of previous operations. There was no association between osteitis and age, gender, smoking, co-existing asthma, allergy or <b>Sumpter's</b> triad. Additionally, there was no correlation between osteitis and symptom burden including headache, facial pain and nasal subset score of the RhinoSinusitis Outcome Measure. Conclusion: In patients with recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis who have undergone multiple surgeries in the past, {{the incidence}} of osteitis can be as high as 64 %. It {{does not seem to be}} associated with more troublesome symptoms; however, it is strongly associated with previous sinus surgery, which may be a manifestation of a shared endpoint (underlying recalcitrant disease...|$|R

2500|$|For example, in <b>Sumpter</b> v Hedges {{a builder}} {{performed}} £333 worth of work, but then abandoned {{completion of the}} contract. The Court of Appeal held he could not recover any money for the building left on the land, even though the buyer subsequently used the foundations to complete the job. This rule provides a powerful remedy in home construction cases to a customer. So in Bolton v Mahadeva Mr Bolton installed a £560 heating system in Mahadeva's house. However, it leaked and would cost £174 to correct (i.e. 31% of the price).

Davros plays on the Doctor's sympathies to trick him into revitalising a dying Dalek empire, siphoning some of the Doctor's regeneration energy to do so. The Doctor also enlivens a mass of dying Daleks consigned to the sewers of Skaro, who begin to tear the city apart, and he makes his escape with Clara, but not before visiting Davros as a young boy on the battlefields of Skaro, and instilling in him a lesson about the virtues of mercy. In [...] "The Girl Who Died," [...] the Doctor finally remembers that he shares a face with a man he was persuaded to save in Pompeii, despite his initial reluctance to alter the timeline.
