40|$|A general {{method for}} calculating the {{short-circuit}} currents of a squirrel-cage (SCIG) and a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) using crowbar protection is presented. The method {{results in an}} approximate analytic expression that allows calculating the SCIG and DFIG short-circuit currents {{as a function of}} time for symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults in the power system. The presented theoretical analysis highlights some important differences between the short-circuit behavior of the SCIG and the DFIG with high crowbar resistance. A comparison with time simulations of the same model shows that the proposed approach leads to results whose accuracy is comparable to those obtained through dynamic simulations and may be sufficient to replace the use of simulations in many contexts, e. g. calculation of maximum current, calculation of its DC and AC components and <b>short-circuit</b> calculations for <b>protection</b> relay settings.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} mainly {{focused on the}} {{development}} of (i) phase shifting transformers (PSTs) mathematical and simulation models {{that can be used for}} the <b>short-circuit</b> and <b>protection</b> studies, and (ii) new phase shifting transformers protection methods that provide more secure and sensitive solutions than the standard current differential protection. The first part of this thesis describes and presents the modeling of the single-core standard-delta, and two-core symmetrical and asymmetrical PST for <b>protection</b> and <b>short-circuit</b> studies. The models already available for such types of PSTs have limitations and require detailed test report data from the manufacturers. However, winding test data at each tap position is seldom available from the manufacturers. Moreover, they are confined to the balanced system conditions. The proposed modeling approach is based {{on the development of}} positive, negative and zero-sequence networks. Derived mathematical relations are further used to develop the relations of winding terminal voltages, currents and impedances as a function of tap position. Accuracy of the presented models is verified mathematically with the manufacturer’s test report data. Furthermore, electromagnetic transients program (EMTP) modeling, in commercially available simulation tools such as PSCAD/EMTDC and RTDS, is done in order to further verify the proposed models. The proposed modeling approach does not rely on the availability of the manufacturer test report data and only requires the nameplate information. It can also be used for both balanced and unbalanced system conditions. The second part of the thesis presents two protection principles: (a) electromagnetic differential protection, and (b) directional comparison-based protection. The main motive behind the development of new protection principles is to develop a solution that is more secure, sensitive and offers high-speed protection. Correct implementation of these techniques for the protection of various kinds of PSTs comes across various problems and hence leads us to the proposed solution of those issues. Both techniques solve the problems of conventional challenges such as magnetizing inrush current, core saturation, non-standard phase shift, external fault with current transformer (CT) saturation, etc. The electromagnetic differential protection principle can only be applied to the PST it represents and it requires tap position tracking. A directional comparison-based approach can be applied to any kind of PST without tracking the tap position...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to the distributed generation system protection coordination based on directional overcurrent protections with inverse-time characteristics. The key question of protection coordination is the determination of correct values of all inverse-time characteristics coefficients. The coefficients must be correctly chosen considering the sufficiently short tripping times and the sufficiently long selectivity times. In the paper {{a new approach}} to protection coordination is designed, in which not only some, but all the required types of short-circuit contributions are taken into account. In radial systems, if the pickup currents are correctly chosen, protection coordination for maximum contributions is enough to ensure selectivity times for all the required short-circuit types. In distributed generation systems, due to different contributions flowing through the primary and selective protections, coordination for maximum contributions is not enough, but all the short-circuit types must be taken into account, and the protection coordination becomes a complex problem. A possible solution to the problem, based on an appropriately designed optimization, has been proposed in the paper. By repeating a simple optimization considering only one <b>short-circuit</b> type, the <b>protection</b> coordination considering all the required short-circuit types has been achieved. To show the importance of considering all the types of short-circuit contributions, setting optimizations with one (the highest) and all the types of short-circuit contributions have been performed. Finally, selectivity time values are explored throughout the entire protected section, and both the settings are compared...|$|R
40|$|Current Source Inverter (CSI) {{topology}} {{is gaining}} acceptance as a competitive alternative for grid interface {{of renewable energy}} systems due to its unique and advantageous features. Merits of CSI over the more popular Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) topology have been elaborated on {{by a number of}} researchers. However, there is a dearth of quality work in modeling and control of CSI topology interfacing renewable energy resources to the grid. To enrich the study focussing on application of CSI for renewable energy interface, this thesis develops a multilevel structure based on CSI for three-phase grid-connected Photovoltaic (PV) application. In the first part of research, a single-stage CSI interfacing to PV array is developed. The CSI-based PV system is equipped with Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT), DC-link current controller, and AC-side current controller. To eliminate the nonlinearity introduced by the PV array, a feed-forward control is introduced in the DC-link current controller. The AC-side current controller is responsible for maintaining unity power factor at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC). To verify the performance of the developed CSI-based PV system, a number of simulation studies are carried out in PSCAD/EMTDC environment. To illustrate the performance of the CSI-based PV system during transients on the grid side, simulation studies are carried out for four kinds of faults. Results obtained from fault studies are highly in favor of CSI topology and provide illustrative evidence for <b>short-circuit</b> current <b>protection</b> capability of the CSI. On the other hand, the VSI-based PV system performs poorly when subjected to similar grid transients. To extend the research on CSI-based PV system further, a multilevel structure based on CSI is developed. The multilevel structure is a parallel combination of $n$ CSI units and capable of producing $ 2 n+ 1 $ levels of current at the terminal of the inverter. Each unit in the multilevel structure has its own MPPT, DC-link current controller. However, on the AC-side a combined current controller is proposed. The design results in a high power rating with reduced number of filters, sensors and controllers. The developed multilevel structure can operate with PV arrays exposed to equal and unequal insolation level. However, when the PV arrays are operating under unequal insolation level, low order harmonics are generated in the sinusoidal current that is injected into the grid. Elimination of these harmonics is performed by implementing a modified control strategy in stationary reference frame that corresponds to the harmonic component that needs to be minimized. The modified control strategy operates in coordination with the existing DC-side and AC-side current controllers, and MPPTs. Therefore, real-time suppression of current harmonics can be ensured. Performance of the multilevel structure is verified by different transient studies...|$|R

40|$|Despite of {{the careful}} {{building}} {{and maintenance of}} the electricity network, faults like short-circuit and earth-faults take place from time to time. Majority of the faults customers experience in low voltage networks are caused by the faults in the medium voltage networks. Therefore minimizing faults in medium voltage networks contributes {{to the quality of}} delivery. A way of improving the quality of delivery is to sectionalize the protection areas into smaller units with network reclosers. Reclosers include <b>short-circuit</b> and earth-fault <b>protection</b> and auto-reclosing functionalities. The best results are gained by placing the recloser so {{that the majority of the}} faults stay behind the device and the customers on the other side, so that they are not affected by the outage caused by the fault occurring behind the recloser. The quality of delivery indexes are improved by using reclosers. After the great storms in the Nordic countries the network owners started to replace over-head line networks with underground cable. The cable characteristics, however, are very different from the characteristics of an over-head line. Cabling increases the capacitive earth-fault current for it may be considered as a cylindrical capacitor. Due to this, also the reactive power generation is increased in cabled networks. Cable can be represented with a pi-section in which the series impedance consists of reactive and resistive parts. Because an underground cable has a zero sequence series impedance which is non-negligible on contrary to over-head line, cabling long feeders produces a resistive earth-fault current component. This cannot be compensated with the usage of a Petersen coil, which is used to compensate purely capacitive earth-fault current. Increase in earth-fault current may cause hazards for human safety because the earth-fault current can energize network equipment and thereby cause dangerous over-voltages. Therefore the contact voltages have to be limited also in terms of regulations. The studies regarding earth-fault current behavior were carried out with a program namely Power System simulator for Engineering. The studies show that as the cabling increases, the zero sequence resistance becomes more dominating. When using only centralized compensation the zero sequence resistance produces resistive earth-fault current, which may cause dangerous over-voltages and causes voltage drops in zero sequence network. This may lead to difficulties in detecting high impedance earth-faults. The fault detection can be contributed with the usage of distributed compensation. The best results are gained by compensating first 10 - 15 kilometers centrally and the rest locally. The distributed Petersen coil should be dimensioned according to the produced earth-fault current in order to avoid over-compensation which may lead to false relay functions. The cable zero sequence impedance, however, is not an unambiguous matter. Therefore some field tests should be performed in the future in order to achieve even better knowledge regarding these issues. /Kir 1...|$|R
40|$|Proper <b>short-circuit</b> <b>protection</b> in dc {{distribution}} {{systems has}} provided an austere challenge to researchers as {{the development of}} commercially-viable equipment providing fast operation, coordination and reliability still continues. The objective of this thesis is to analyze issues associated with <b>short-circuit</b> <b>protection</b> of low-voltage dc (LVDC) distribution systems and propose a <b>short-circuit</b> <b>protection</b> methodology based on solid-state circuit breakers (SSCBs) that provides fault-current limiting (FCL).

40|$|A {{scheme for}} {{protection}} against short circuits has been devised for series strings of lithium electrochemical cells that contain built-in <b>short-circuit</b> <b>protection</b> devices, which {{go into a}} high-resistance, current-limiting state when heated by excessive current.
