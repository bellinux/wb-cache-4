500|$|On 6 March 1862, {{the ship}} {{departed}} New York bound for Fort Monroe, Virginia, towed by the ocean-going tug Seth Low {{and accompanied by}} the gunboats [...] and [...] Worden, not trusting the seal between the turret and the hull, and ignoring Ericsson's advice, wedged the former in the up position and stuffed oakum and <b>sail</b> <b>cloth</b> in the gap. Rising seas that night washed the oakum away and water poured underneath the turret, {{as well as through}} the hawsepipe, various hatches, ventilation pipes, and the two funnels, so that the belts for the ventilation and boiler fans loosened and fell off and the fires in the boilers were nearly extinguished {{over the course of the}} next day; this created a toxic atmosphere in the engine room that knocked out most of the engine-room crew. First Assistant Engineer Isaac Newton ordered the engine room abandoned and had the able-bodied crew drag the afflicted engine room hands to the top of the turret where the fresh air could revive them. Both Newton and Stimers worked desperately to get the blowers to work, but they too succumbed to the noxious fumes and were taken above. One fireman was able to punch a hole in the fan box, drain the water, and restart the fan. Later that night, the wheel ropes controlling the ship's rudder jammed, making it near impossible to control the ship's heading in the rough seas. Monitor was now in danger of foundering, so Worden signaled Seth Low for help and had Monitor towed to calmer waters closer to shore so she was able to restart her engines later that evening. She rounded Cape Charles around 3:00pm on 8 March and entered Chesapeake Bay, reaching Hampton Roads at 9:00pm, well after the first day's fighting in the Battle of Hampton Roads had concluded.|$|E

2500|$|Kirkcaldy {{became a}} centre for iron {{founding}} and linen manufacturing—specialising in coarser material (i.e. sailcloth). Although {{when the market}} for <b>sail</b> <b>cloth</b> started to dip, Michael Nairn for instance began to focus more towards floorcloth, which he started to produce in his new purpose built Scottish floorboard factory at Pathhead Sands, famously nicknamed [...] "Nairn’s folly" [...] for what would become universally known as linoleum. Linoleum was first introduced by the Scottish Linoleum Company (later Barry, Ostlere and Shepherd), due to the expired patent of Frederick Walton in 1877. Although the Michael Nairn & Co Ltd have since become famous, for their Trade Mark and being the world producers of the cloth. The cloth made from cork, wood flour and linseed oil, saw production conicide with the jute mills of Dundee - with some already present in the town, particularly the West Bridges Mill in Linktown. This made Kirkcaldy easily recognisable from the queer-like smell of the odour {{of one of the}} principal ingredients, linseed oil. The Nairns, as a family, became philanthropists bequeathing land for public and commercial use, {{over the course of several}} decades, as [...] "good deeds" [...] to the citizens of Kirkcaldy, with examples such as two public parks (Beveridge and Ravenscraig) and a museum, art gallery and library complex. Other industries such as coal, pottery, flour, malt, printing, light electrical engineering and furniture manufacturing flourished. Carpets, whose production coincided with linoleum, were also made in the town for a brief time by the firm Victoria Carpets until they moved their production to Kidderminster in 1901. The burghs of Pathhead, Linktown, Gallatown and Sinclairtown were also officially merged into the royal burgh of Kirkcaldy in 1876.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{powering}} {{requirement of}} a land yacht {{is one of the}} most important aspects of land yacht design. Wind tunnel testing of land yacht is an effective design tool. In fact, changing the parameters of the vehicle and testing the changes in the wind tunnel will give us a better understanding of the most efficient vehicle but it is very time consuming, expensive, and has inherent scaling errors. Another set of design tools are Computational Fluid Dynamics and parametric prediction. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes are not yet wholly proven in its accuracy. Parametric prediction is starting point for most of the engineering studies. It will be used to calculate the land yacht’s performance and provide a steady-state trim solution for the dynamic simulation. This tool is absolutely validating. In present work, parametric prediction tool has been used for velocity prediction of a radio control land yacht with a rigid airfoil and <b>cloth</b> <b>sail.</b> The lift and drag coefficient of the rigid wing and <b>cloth</b> <b>sail</b> are obtained from the wind tunnel. The results show that the maximum velocity of the land yacht model with rigid wing is higher than either in <b>cloth</b> <b>sail</b> and occurs in 100 to 130 degree angle of courses. yacht. Another advantage of rigid wing is more longevity than <b>cloth</b> <b>sail.</b> In present work, we have used a typical airfoil with maximum lift coefficient about 1. 3. We have used the velocity calculating method for this land yacht with <b>cloth</b> <b>sail</b> and rigid wing. This method is applicable to all sail craft with appropriate substitutions for references to land [1]. The results show reasonably good agreement in tendency with the experimental results which obtained from the road test of the land yacht.

50|$|The Kirkemølle is the island's oldest {{standing}} stone mill. It {{dates from}} 1861 when it replaced a 150-year-old post mill {{on the same}} site. The cylindrical tower mill measured 9.5 m to the cap. Built of sandstone masony, it had a wooden cap and four floors. Originally it had common <b>cloth</b> <b>sails</b> but in 1899 they were replaced with self-regulating patent sails. Until 1908, the mill was rotated manually but after being heightened a further 1.9 m, it was equipped with a wind rose. In 1932, a 34 hp Ruston & Hornsby diesel engine was installed. The mill was closed in 1969 but from 1969 it functioned using the diesel engine rather than from wind power.|$|R

The longship appeared in its complete form between the 9th and 13th centuries. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boat-building traditions until today. The particular skills and methods employed in making longships are still used worldwide, often with modern adaptations.
