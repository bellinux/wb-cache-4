50|$|An {{interlocked}} yard is {{a railway}} yard where semaphore or coloured light signals are controlled {{in such a}} way that signals cannot be set to proceed unless the points that operate in conjunction with the signals are correctly set. A mechanical interlocking device is a system of rods, <b>sliding</b> <b>bars</b> and <b>levers</b> that are configured so that points cannot be changed in conflict, thus preventing movements that may cause a collision or other accident.|$|R
2500|$|To {{coordinate}} signals {{so that it}} {{is impossible}} to give a [...] "clear" [...] signal to a train unless the route is actually clear, the signals could be interlocked. An interlocked yard is a railway yard where semaphore or coloured light signals are controlled in such a way that the signals will not allow a train to proceed unless the points that operate in conjunction with the signals are correctly set. A mechanical interlocking device, located under a mechanical signal frame, is a system of rods, <b>sliding</b> <b>bars</b> and <b>levers</b> that are configured so that points cannot be changed in conflict, thus preventing movements that may cause a collision or other accident.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a new suction tube for microsurgical procedures which permit a precise {{control of the}} pressure of suction. The new device consists of a suction tube connected to a laterally placed <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> which progressively opens or closes a leak. The surgeon can readily adjust the suction pressure by moving slightly the <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> with his thumb or index!nger up and down almost instantaneously...|$|R

50|$|In a {{double-acting}} steam engine, {{as used in}} {{a railway}} locomotive, {{the direction of the}} vertical thrust on the <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> is always upwards when running forward. It varies from nothing at the end of stroke to a maximum at half stroke when the angle between the con-rod and crank are greatest. When the crank-pin drives the piston, as when coasting, the piston thrust is downwards. The position of maximum thrust is shown by the increased wear at the middle of the <b>slide</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
30|$|Components of {{configuration}} panel are as follows: sensing range <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which sets sensing range of sensor; communication range <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which sets communication range of sensor; supersonic wave range <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which sets supersonic wave range of sensor; frame delay <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which adjusts moving speed of sensor; sensing range checker, which checks if the sensing range of mobile sensor is visualized; communication range checker, which checks if the communication range of sensor is visualized; supersonic wave range checker, which checks if the supersonic wave range of sensor is visualized; node trace line checker, which checks if the distance in which sensor moved until the current time after being {{deployed in the}} beginning is visualized; goal coverage checker, which stops MSNS from operating when a user reaches the desired coverage; interval time checker, which pauses MSNS in operation during a certain time interval; degree K taker, which receives input {{of the number of}} neighboring sensors that sensors should maintain; number of sensor nodes taker, which receives input of the number of sensors to be deployed in the target area; initial deployment selector, which selects the initial location in which sensor are deployed when the MSNS starts; button to start and reset MSNS; and button to pause MSNS in operation and restart it.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{technical}} {{factors such as}} analytical design and virtual prototyping, the simple but representative <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> was chosen in this paper and its mathematical model of working contour was established by using the analytic method. And then, the parameterized model and VRML file structural drawing of <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> were given by using double extrusion method. It was proved that {{the components of the}} tripod universal joint were formed easily by using the double extrusion method based on Extrusion nodes. In addition, the tripod universal joint assembly model was also accomplished by using Inline nodes and bottom-up assembling method...|$|R

50|$|In 1907 the {{locomotives}} were {{fitted with}} new domed boilers, replacing the domeless versions originally fitted. This increased their weight by 3 tons which improved their adhesion factor. Power reversing gear was fitted in 1922, making them {{the first class}} in New South Wales to be so fitted. It was a hydraulic type and was excellent when shunting at Sydney station, however this was only short lived and Johnson <b>bar</b> <b>lever</b> reversing gear was fitted shortly after.|$|R
25|$|The {{drive was}} on the {{trailing}} wheels and the <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> were attached to a motion bracket just behind the leading wheels. The wheels themselves had twelve spokes and very large balance weights. The front pair of wheels of the engine were partially enclosed in splashers which did not come above the running plate.|$|R
25|$|A {{minor change}} to the {{appearance}} of the streamlining was the removal of the locomotives' solid cowcatcher and its replacement with a lattice type, after it was discovered that the original design created a partial vacuum behind the cowcatcher, sucking dust and grime into the <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> for the centre cylinder, leading to maintenance problems.|$|R

5000|$|The {{locomotive}} had flat [...] "D" [...] type sliding valves {{which were}} actuated by Heusinger valve gear, with Laird type crossheads with single <b>slide</b> <b>bars.</b> To protect the motion from wind-blown {{sand in the}} Namib Desert, it had plate shields arranged along {{the full length of}} the engine, hinged on the running board to allow access to the motion.|$|R
50|$|An {{approach}} to slide guitar {{that does not}} use a bottleneck worn over a finger {{is to use the}} index and middle fingers to hold a weighted lighter (sold as the fireslide) against the strings. The middle, fourth and fifth fingers are used to fret between the slide and the bridge, allowing the player to perform <b>sliding</b> <b>barred</b> chords and scales.|$|R

30|$|The buccal segment model {{consisted}} of five (from the second premolar {{to the central}} incisor) monocrystalline ceramic brackets [11]. The interbracket distance was set at 8.5 mm. The canine bracket was welded to a <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> that allowed different vertical positions, while the other brackets were mounted on a vice-like device. A section of a 0.0215 × 0.028 -in. stainless steel wire was used to align all the brackets.|$|R
40|$|We have {{implemented}} a visualization {{tool for the}} demonstration of a nonideal Carnot engine, operating at finite time. The cycle time can be varied using a <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> and the pressure-volume, temperature-entropy, power-time, and efficiency-time diagrams change interactively and are shown on one screen.

5000|$|The Laramie has an {{automatic}} safety on the hammer {{consisting of a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>bar.</b> After each shot, the bar automatically positions itself between the hammer and the frame, preventing accidental discharge. [...] The bar also blocks the barrel releasing device and {{the rotation of the}} cylinder. The revolver can be transported safely when the hammer is in the half-cock notch, in this position the cylinder is able to rotate and the barrel can be opened for loading or unloading.|$|R
5000|$|A steel <b>bar,</b> {{also called}} <b>slide,</b> play <b>bar</b> and bottleneck, is a musical {{apparatus}} {{which is used}} to play on steel guitars. The steel bar can be wound around the fingers or just held in the hand. Instead of pressuring the strings on the neck of the guitar, the steel <b>bar</b> <b>slides</b> over the strings, which produces a glissando effect.|$|R
50|$|The transformer, oil {{operated}} {{main switch}} and stepping switch {{were located in}} the centre body. The power supply {{was obtained from the}} catenary via the two diamond-shaped pantographs mounted on each end body. At the start of a journey, both pantographs had to be lifted since they were only equipped with a single <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> without rocker. The cabinets for the reversing pole shunts and the brake resistors were mounted in front of the pantographs, towards the ends of the outer bodies.|$|R
50|$|Soon after {{entering}} service, problems were experienced with failing connecting rods, big end bearings breaking {{up as well}} as cracks developing in the motion girder of the Alligator crossheads. After investigations by SAR engineers with assistance from the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the crossheads, <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> and coupling rods were modified. The crossheads were converted to the multiple-bearing type with single guide bars while the three independent coupling rods were replaced with the more conventional single coupling rod with knuckle joints.|$|R
50|$|As for Stephenson's Killingworth {{locomotives}} of {{the year}} before, it had a centre-flue boiler with two vertical cylinders of about 9 × 24 in set into its top centreline. The cylinders drove <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> mounted beams which turned crankshafts driving the axles through 2:1 reduction gears between the frames. It had a tall, tapering chimney, the lower part being surrounded by a feedwater heater. It would have weighed about 7.5 tons and had {{a top speed of}} around 4.5 mph and a load capacity of about 90 tons over a short distance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{subway car}} {{used as the}} money train in the film is a {{modified}} R21 subway car. The rolling stock was modified by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and film crew into an imposing subway train covered in silver armor plating and equipped with flashing orange lights and <b>sliding</b> <b>barred</b> doors, like those on a jail cell. After production, the car was donated to the New York Transit Museum, and is currently stored at the Coney Island Complex as of February 2010. Other cars were used as props in the movie.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss the {{suitability}} of various equipment types used to capture the user’s subjective perceptual quality evaluation for video streams with time-variant quality. We present four basic types of testing equipment (mouse, joystick, throttle and <b>sliding</b> <b>bar).</b> Since method and equipment used for testing must not influence the test results, we analyzed the requirements for the testing equipment in general and in particular its usability and design features. Furthermore, we performed and evaluated an assessment of video quality using all presented tools. The evaluation allows us to propose the most appropriate testing tool for time-variant video quality.

50|$|The {{chromatic}} harmonica {{is a type}} of harmonica {{that uses}} a button-activated <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> to redirect air from the hole in the mouthpiece to the selected reed-plate desired. When the button is not pressed, an altered diatonic major scale of the key of the harmonica is available, while depressing the button accesses the same scale a semitone higher in each hole. Thus, the instrument is capable of playing the 12 notes of the Western chromatic scale. The chromatic harmonica can thus be contrasted with a standard harmonica, which can play only the notes in a given musical key.|$|R
50|$|Most {{retractable}} doors use a {{spring-loaded roller}} {{very similar to}} a window blind, except the roller is mounted vertically when used in a door application. Screen material {{is attached to the}} roller while {{the opposite side of the}} material is attached to <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> riding on top and bottom tracks. The bar is moved back and forth to open or close the screen. The bar is usually held closed with a magnetic closure. Different types of mesh fabric options are available from standard fiberglass mesh, pet screen resistant mesh and solar screen mesh. The operation of the screens are manually or motorized.|$|R
