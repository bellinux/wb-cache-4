40|$|The {{security}} sector reform {{literature is}} increasingly turning towards {{the inclusion of}} non-state <b>security</b> <b>providers,</b> but the long-term patterns of political development to which such engagement might contribute remain underexplored. This article thus provides several lenses with which to {{understand the relationship between}} non-state security provision and political development. It first presents three perspectives (functionalism, political economy, and communitarianism) with which to understand the nature and behavior of non-state <b>security</b> <b>providers.</b> Second, it outlines five possible long-term trajectories of political formation and the role of non-state <b>security</b> <b>providers</b> in each. These discussions highlight the idea of hybridity, and the remainder of the paper argues that the concept can be usefully applied in (at least) two ways. The third section proposes that hybridity can help overcome longstanding but misleading conceptual binaries, while the fourth rearticulates hybridity as a dynamic developmental process – 'hybridization' – that can be contrasted with security politics as the underlying logic by which <b>security</b> <b>providers</b> (both state and non-state) interact and change over time...|$|R

The code reinforces and articulates the obligations of private <b>security</b> <b>providers</b> particularly with regard to international humanitarian law and human rights law. The ICoC also sets the foundation for developing an institutional framework to provide meaningful and independent oversight of and accountability to the ICoC. Accordingly, the stakeholders involved agreed on ‘Articles of Association’ setting up an effective oversight mechanism.|$|R

40|$|Within the {{repertoire}} of international stabilization interventions, security sector reform (SSR) and other conventional efforts to strengthen security and governance institutions remain central. There is increasing {{recognition that the}} policies and practices operating {{under the rubric of}} SSR are blind to the empirical reality of 'security pluralism' in most stabilization contexts. In these contexts, both <b>security</b> <b>providers</b> directly authorized by the state (police, army) and a multitude of other coercive actors engage in producing and reproducing order, and enjoy varying degrees of public authority and legitimacy. Recognizing this, research was undertaken in three cities (Beirut, Nairobi, and Tunis) to discern the conditions enabling various <b>security</b> <b>providers</b> to forge constructive relations with local populations and governance actors. Drawing on insights generated by these case studies, this article problematizes conventional state-centric approaches and argues for a bold reimagining of SSR.

5000|$|The ICoC is a non-state {{mechanism}} {{and is therefore}} intended to be supplementary to state legal oversight of private <b>security</b> <b>providers.</b> It {{has been designed to}} apply in complex security environments, meaning any areas experiencing or recovering from unrest or instability, whether due to natural disasters or armed conflicts, where the rule of law has been substantially undermined, and in which the capacity of the state authority to handle the situation is diminished, limited, or non-existent. Other non-state attempts to regulate of private security, however, have often been criticized as ineffective. In contrast, the ICoC has been accepted by a significant number of companies, and is supported by states and civil society organizations: As of June 1, 2013, 659 private <b>security</b> <b>providers</b> were signatories to the ICoC. In addition, the United Nations require membership to the ICoC as a mandatory requirement for the hiring of private <b>security</b> <b>providers</b> by the UN agencies. Similarly, the draft Swiss legislation on private <b>security</b> <b>providers</b> requires membership to the ICoC as a precondition for permission to operate in Switzerland a private security company offering services abroad, and only member companies of the ICoC can be hired by Swiss public authorities. Recently, also the US Department of State indicated [...] "as long as the ICoC process moves forward as expected and the association attracts significant industry participation, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) anticipates incorporating membership in the ICoC Association as a requirement in the bidding process for the successor contract to the Worldwide Protective Services (WPS) program." ...|$|R
