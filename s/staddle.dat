5|$|There is a {{small stone}} chapel in the grounds, {{believed}} to date to about 1450 and built by the Hungerford family for use by themselves and their servants. It has an east window with Perpendicular tracery. After {{a long period of}} use as stables, it was restored in the twentieth century. There is also a brick-built storehouse mounted on <b>staddle</b> stones to prevent incursion by rats.|$|E
25|$|<b>Staddle</b> was {{populated}} {{primarily by}} hobbits {{who made a}} living from light agriculture, including pipe-weed. <b>Staddle</b> was on the south-eastern side of Bree-hill, sitting south of Combe and Archet. It was the only village (other than Bree itself) visible from the Great East Road.|$|E
25|$|Combe was {{populated}} {{primarily by}} men, with some hobbits, {{all of whom}} made a living from agriculture. Combe was situated on {{the borders of the}} Chetwood and on the edge of Bree-hill, between the villages of Archet and <b>Staddle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most granaries {{were used}} for the storage of two or three {{separate}} crops, having a capacity of 500 to 2500 bushels. The arrangement of the stones to support the structure and its weight when in use, required nine, twelve or sixteen <b>staddles.</b> The production of <b>staddles</b> was therefore a fairly significant local industry. Small granaries could make do with five, one being in the middle. The Upper Hexford granary in Oxfordshire uses thirty-six <b>staddles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The name {{itself and}} {{evidence}} from surviving vernacular buildings with wooden 'feet' suggest {{that at first}} the <b>staddles</b> or supports were made of wood, such as at Peper Harow granary in Surrey. Stone <b>staddles</b> were longer lasting and a more reliable means of supporting structures which were sometimes a considerable weight.|$|R

At [...] long and [...] wide, the largest part {{is known as the}} Long Garden, between a wall and a yew hedge, with a long flagstone path through a lawn with the pool in the centre and leading up to the pavilion at the end. On {{the other side of the}} yew hedge is the Leisure Garden, designed to be a garden which does not need weeding, from which there are paths to the [...] "Troughery", the Sunken Garden, the Winter Garden and back to the Terrace. The [...] "Troughery" [...] is a small garden which creates features from stone troughs and <b>staddle</b> stones, surrounded by topiary.|$|E
2500|$|Wester Kittochside has two Stathels, {{both made}} in Edinburgh. The {{structure}} {{is basically a}} cast-iron version {{of a set of}} <b>staddle</b> stones with its upper wooden framework. These rare survivals are still in use for supporting ricks, keeping the material well aired and dry underfoot, as well as free from rats and mice which cannot run up the legs of the structure and make it [...] "up and over" [...] the [...] "mushroom shaped" [...] tops and thence into the hay, etc.|$|E
2500|$|The {{church is}} reached by {{walking through the}} grounds of Manor Farm; {{it is common for}} ancient Sussex churches to stand close to farms, but for one to stand in a {{farmyard}} is unusual. [...] Standing outside the approach to the church is a [...] "magnificent" [...] granary apparently dating from the 17th century (one source attributes it to the late Elizabethan or early Stuart period, and others claim a date of 1600). [...] The hipped-roofed building is constructed of red brick with timber framing. [...] It stands on <b>staddle</b> stones—mushroom-shaped supports that lift the structure clear of the ground as a safeguard against damp and vermin. [...] Some restoration has been carried out. [...] Originally, {{it was part of the}} neighbouring Manor Farm—"one of the best farmhouses in this part of Sussex" [...] according to Nikolaus Pevsner—but since the 1970s it has been used for various purposes by St George's Church.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop the draught {{under the}} wheat-rick!" [...] cried Gabriel to those nearest to him.

50|$|The base stones taper {{towards the}} top with an {{overlapping}} cap stone placed above, making it almost impossible for a rodent to climb up and into the hay or grain stored above. The air could freely circulate beneath the stored crops and this helped to keep it dry. A wood framework was placed onto {{the tops of the}} stones, the <b>staddles</b> being arranged in two or three rows, giving sixteen or more stones. The hayricks, Tithe barns, granaries, etc. were built on top of this frame.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Staddle</b> stones (variations include Steddle stones [...] ) were {{originally}} used as supporting bases for granaries, hayricks, game larders, etc. The <b>staddle</b> stones lifted the granaries {{above the ground}} thereby protecting the stored grain from vermin and water seepage. In Middle English <b>staddle</b> or stadle is stathel, from Old English stathol, a foundation, support or trunk of a tree. They can be mainly found in England, Galicia and Asturias (Northern Spain).|$|E
50|$|Old land deeds {{in northeastern}} United States often refer to Oak <b>Staddle</b> or Walnut <b>Staddle.</b> These deeds {{are from the}} late 18th century to the middle 19th century. Either the owners would cut a tree leaving the stump and request that the {{surveyors}} measure to it, or the surveyor would measure out {{to the location of}} a new lot corner and a <b>staddle</b> would be inserted into the ground like a boundary stone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Staddle</b> was {{populated}} {{primarily by}} hobbits {{who made a}} living from light agriculture, including pipe-weed. <b>Staddle</b> was on the south-eastern side of Bree-hill, sitting south of Combe and Archet.

50|$|These {{were often}} {{constructed}} with wooden weather-boards {{such as at}} Blaxland Farm in Sturry, Kent, which has nine <b>staddles.</b> However, if the grain was stored loose then the sides were filled in with brick nogging and light lath-and-plaster at the wall tops. Wooden {{steps up to the}} buildings were detachable and stored by hanging them up {{on the side of the}} structure. If stone or brick steps were built then the top step was not built, thus denying access to rats and other vermin. Some of these granaries had a 'cat flap' and others had a recess inside the steps which served as a dog kennel.|$|R
60|$|Gabriel {{took the}} key, without {{waiting to hear}} the {{conclusion}} of the tirade. Ten minutes later his lonely figure might have been seen dragging four large water-proof coverings across the yard, and soon two of these heaps of treasure in grain were covered snug--two cloths to each. Two hundred pounds were secured. Three wheat-stacks remained open, and there were no more cloths. Oak looked under the <b>staddles</b> and found a fork. He mounted the third pile of wealth and began operating, adopting the plan of sloping the upper sheaves one over the other; and, in addition, filling the interstices with the material of some untied sheaves.|$|R
60|$|Henchard, as was natural, dealt largely {{with this}} nursery or bed of small farmers close at hand--and his waggons were often down that way. One day, when {{arrangements}} were in progress for getting home corn {{from one of}} the aforesaid farms, Elizabeth-Jane received a note by hand, asking her to oblige the writer by coming at once to a granary on Durnover Hill. As this was the granary whose contents Henchard was removing, she thought the request {{had something to do with}} his business, and proceeded thither as soon as she had put on her bonnet. The granary was just within the farm-yard, and stood on stone <b>staddles,</b> high enough for persons to walk under. The gates were open, but nobody was within. However, she entered and waited. Presently she saw a figure approaching the gate--that of Donald Farfrae. He looked up at the church clock, and came in. By some unaccountable shyness, some wish not to meet him there alone, she quickly ascended the step-ladder leading to the granary door, and entered it before he had seen her. Farfrae advanced, imagining himself in solitude, and a few drops of rain beginning to fall he moved and stood under the shelter where she had just been standing. Here he leant against one of the <b>staddles,</b> and gave himself up to patience. He, too, was plainly expecting some one; could it be herself? If so, why? In a few minutes he looked at his watch, and then pulled out a note, a duplicate of the one she had herself received.|$|R

60|$|Not {{a drop of}} {{rain had}} fallen as yet. He wiped his weary brow, and {{looked again at the}} black forms of the {{unprotected}} stacks. Was his life so valuable to him after all? What were his prospects that he should be so chary of running risk, when important and urgent labour could not be carried on without such risk? He resolved to stick to the stack. However, he took a precaution. Under the <b>staddles</b> was a long tethering chain, used to prevent the escape of errant horses. This he carried up the ladder, and sticking his rod through the clog at one end, allowed {{the other end of the}} chain to trail upon the ground. The spike attached to it he drove in. Under the shadow of this extemporized lightning-conductor he felt himself comparatively safe.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Henchard {{was not in}} the house, but in the store-yard. She was {{conducted}} into the mossy garden, and through a door in the wall, which was studded with rusty nails speaking of generations of fruit-trees that had been trained there. The door opened upon the yard, and here she was left to find him as she could. It was a place flanked by hay-barns, into which tons of fodder, all in trusses, were being packed from the waggons she had seen pass the inn that morning. On other sides of the yard were wooden granaries on stone <b>staddles,</b> to which access was given by Flemish ladders, and a store-house several floors high. Wherever the doors of these places were open, a closely packed throng of bursting wheat-sacks could be seen standing inside, with the air of awaiting a famine that would not come.|$|R

50|$|In 1930 Parsons {{moved from}} Northwood, {{where he had}} lived for many years, to Shalbourne in Wiltshire. There {{he set up a}} studio at Ropewind Farm where he {{converted}} a mid-18th century three-bay barn, adding a large, porch-like window to let in natural light on the north side. He also incorporated a small granary on rather unusual brick and timber <b>staddles</b> thus converting it into a larger purpose-built storage building and garage, giving access directly from Rivar Road. The house he lived in adjoined the site. It should have been an idyllic time for Parsons but his health deteriorated and finally, in 1933, he had to return to London, took a flat in Putney and worked for a while with his great friend Edward Woore. He died there the following year at the young age of 50. After his death on 30 September 1934, the cause of death being given as cerebral thrombosis and arterio-sclerosis, existing commissions were taken over or completed by Woore.|$|R

The lot <b>staddles</b> today's Channing Road from Havern Street down to the Charles River. He lived there with his wife for over a decade, and played {{a leading role in the}} affairs of the town.

50|$|A {{fine example}} is the English Granary built 1731, {{supported}} on <b>staddle</b> Stones, which {{can be seen in}} the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum in West Sussex, UK. Such structures were common in Southern England in the 18th century. At Higher Farm in Heathfield, Tavistock, <b>Staddle</b> Stones are part of the substantial barns built by the Duke of Bedford in the 19th century. The dressed granite stone bases have specially hewn slate tops.|$|E
50|$|The <b>staddle</b> stones {{usually had}} a {{separate}} head and base {{which gave the}} whole structure a 'mushroom' like appearance. Different areas in the United Kingdom had different designs. The base varied from cylindrical to tapered rectangular to near triangular. Flat topped cone shaped <b>staddle</b> stones {{are to be found}} in parts of the Isle of Wight. The tops are flat to support the beams, however some variation does exists, such as square tops, fluted designs, slate tops, etc.|$|E
60|$|There was a moon {{during the}} early part of John's walk home, but when he had arrived within a mile of Overcombe the sky clouded over, and rain {{suddenly}} began to fall with some violence. Near him was a wooden granary on tall stone <b>staddles,</b> and perceiving that the rain was only a thunderstorm which would soon pass away, he ascended the steps and entered the doorway, where he stood watching the half-obscured moon through the streaming rain. Presently, to his surprise, he beheld a female figure running forward with great rapidity, not towards the granary for shelter, but towards open ground. What could she be running for in that direction? The answer came in the appearance of his brother Bob from that quarter, seated {{on the back of his}} father's heavy horse. As soon as the woman met him, Bob dismounted and caught her in his arms. They stood locked together, the rain beating into their unconscious forms, and the horse looking on.|$|R
