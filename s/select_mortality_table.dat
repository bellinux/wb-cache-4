40|$|This paper {{deals with}} pure death risk insurance, {{based on a}} natural premium system. Due to the {{underwriting}} procedure the underlying death risk for an insured person will differ from the mortality of another insured person of the same age, if their policies have been issued at different points of time- the phenomenon of <b>select</b> <b>mortality</b> among insured lives. Despite this, {{it will be necessary}} to base the tariff on an aggregated rating system. Basing the tariff on <b>select</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>tables</b> will result in healthy people continuously lapsing their contracts and demanding the issuing premium rate, according to their actual age. Setting an aggregated premium rate that is not loss-bringing is discussed, taking into consideration lapsing of contracts and including also a presumption regarding the force of entry as a function of age. The framework for the analysis is a multi-state time continuous Markov model...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the payment of {{lifetime}} pensions paid by pension companies based on the <b>selected</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>table</b> of the Czech Statistical Office. We assume different input values {{depending on the size}} of the Sharpe ratio pension companies from selected countries. This paper aims to identify and assess the impact of the Sharpe ratio on the payment of lifetime pensions in postproduction period. We used data of nominal appreciation of pension companies from the Visegrad countries and Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands in the period 2005 – 2013. In the empirical analysis we additionally distinguished between guaranteed and non-guaranteed pension funds. For the purpose of calculating lifetime pensions, we used the formula early paid pension by the pension company on the Czech market down in its her pension plan with an expected median payment period of r years. We found link between the value of the Sharpe ratio and the size of lifetime pensions. Conclusion of the paper shows the effects of low performance of pension funds on lifetime pension with a focus on the Czech Republic.

40|$|Actuarial {{functions}} can {{be calculated}} by using <b>mortality</b> <b>table</b> and its approach by mortality law. One famous mortality law is Makeham mortality law. The mortality law approach towards the <b>mortality</b> <b>table</b> is applied because the result is continuous. The mortality law approach can explain any phenomenon which happens in a population. The discrepancies between data which is approached by data from Makeham mortality law and <b>mortality</b> <b>table</b> can affect the accuracy in estimating actuarial functions and actuarial present value of benefit. In this research, writer calculates the actuarial present value of benefit with constant interest rate, Vasicek and Cox-Ingersol-Ross (CIR) interest rate to anticipate the interest rate fluctuation. Writer uses data from United States <b>mortality</b> <b>table</b> period 1979 - 1981, 3 rd Indonesian <b>Mortality</b> <b>Table</b> (2011) for men, 3 rd Indonesian <b>Mortality</b> <b>Table</b> (2011) for women, and the approximation by Makeham mortality law. Writer intends to discuss the relation between age of the insured and stochastic interest rate parameters to the actuarial present value of benefit. Furthermore, writer compares the actuarial present value of benefits obtained from <b>mortality</b> <b>tables</b> and their approximation.

It describes the construction of generational <b>mortality</b> <b>tables</b> {{and the creation of}} RBNS claims reserves. Besides the demonstration of these models, the work analyzes the results of calculating reserves in accordance with generational <b>mortality</b> <b>tables</b> and actual <b>mortality</b> <b>tables</b> of the Czech Republic. An impor- tant element in provision calculating is the simulation of future life expectancy of the insured, i. e. random generation of life expectancy based on generational mortality data. Characteristics of the distribution of reserves are derived from simulations. Furthermore, we compare the results of stochastic and determi- nistic approach of computing the reserves.

The tables were based on data collected from insurance companies which represent about 80 per cent of the Brazilian insurance market, and they are updates of their previous versions, BR-EMS 2010, which have been the first <b>mortality</b> <b>tables</b> built with Brazilian market experience. Additional data from government sources was used to improve the information of the companies&# 8217; databases. The mortality rates of the population under risk products (death coverage) are remarkably different than those under savings products (survivorship coverage); as such, four different <b>mortality</b> <b>tables</b> are constructed, separating the population by sex as well as the type of insurance coverage. A straight comparison between the BR-EMS 2015 tables with the statistics of the general Brazilian population shows a striking difference on life expectancies.

The data used are drawn from the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) and the National Population Council (CONAPO). We also fit a Brass-type relational model to compare gaps between general population mortality and the mortality estimates for the insured population used by the National Insurance and Finance Commission in Mexico. As the life tables for insured lives are unisex, i. e. they do not differentiate between men and women, we assume various sex ratios in the <b>mortality</b> <b>tables</b> for insured lives.
