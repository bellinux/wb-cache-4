5|$|Princess Andrew {{returned}} to Great Britain in April 1947 {{to attend the}} November wedding of her only son, Philip, to Princess Elizabeth, the elder daughter and heir presumptive of King George VI. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> of her remaining jewels used in Princess Elizabeth's engagement ring. On {{the day of the}} wedding, her son was created Duke of Edinburgh by George VI. For the wedding ceremony, Princess Andrew sat at the head of her family {{on the north side of}} Westminster Abbey, opposite the King, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary. It was decided not to invite Princess Andrew's daughters to the wedding because of anti-German sentiment in Britain following World War II.|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles Timess Agustin Gurza {{described}} {{the creative process}} between the pair as Chan creating the instrumental first, followed by Chana crafting the lyrics and melodies alongside him. Chana based her lyrics on her previous relationships and break-ups, while Chan found inspiration in the music of Manu Chao. Chana reported that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> difficulties during the production process due to the personal nature of the lyrics. Although she {{said that it was}} more challenging to write lyrics in Spanish, Chana expressed a preference for it as she felt that it was more poetic than English. She often consulted a Spanish-English dictionary to translate her ideas.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, while {{cruising}} in North American waters, Dogali {{stopped at}} the Pensacola Navy Yard, where <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> maintenance done on her engines. Later that year she was present for a ceremony in Capitán Pastene, Chile, a town founded by Italian immigrants. In January 1908, the Italian government sold Dogali to Uruguay. She was renamed 25 de Agosto for the date Uruguay declared its independence. At the time, she was the largest warship in the Uruguayan Navy. In 1910, the ship was renamed Montevideo after the country's capital city. She was decommissioned in 1914, but remained in the Uruguayan Navy's inventory until 1932, when the old cruiser was finally sold to be broken up.|$|E

5|$|In late March, West Nohno {{began the}} first of three Boston–Liverpool round trips. On the Halifax–Liverpool leg of this first trip, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> {{unspecified}} problem that required her return to Halifax, but {{it must have been a}} minor problem since she sailed again for Liverpool a week later. The cargo ship returned to Boston on 3 June and began her second voyage to Liverpool on 30 June. While in the UK she called at Loch Ewe, Methil, and Oban in July and August before her 6 September return to Boston. Her third journey was an extended one that began by sailing from Boston on 3 October. She arrived at Liverpool three weeks later. During the next seven weeks, she made her way to Milford Haven, from which she began her last westbound transatlantic crossing on 13 December. West Nohno arrived in Boston on 5 January 1944.|$|E

Jones agreed, she said, {{out of a sense}} of patriotism.|$|E

Ten years after Magherita’s death in 1618 brought upon financial strains on the convent.

While in Puerto Cortés, she wrote much of Seraph on the Suwanee, set in Florida. Hurston expressed interest in the polyethnic nature {{of the population in}} the region (many, such as the Miskito Zambu and Garifuna, were of partial African ancestry and had developed creole cultures).|$|E
25|$|Praed {{never lost}} her {{interest}} in her native country and though {{most of her life}} was passed in England, a large proportion of her novels were based on her Australian experiences.

She was much interested in psychological problems, her character-drawing is good although her women are better than her men, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> sense of humour, and she could tell a story. She is entitled to a leading place among the Australian novelists who developed in the nineteenth century.|$|E

She later appeared in the Calida commercial with her then-boyfriend Dino Morea, which was controversial for picturing them sultrily; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> protesters outside her house after that.

25|$|James {{reports that}} Kent fought {{for almost two}} hours and that Rivington {{was killed by a}} shot to the head as the French boarded. He states that Kents {{armament}} consisted of twenty 12-pounders, and six 6-pounders on her castles, and that Confiances armament consisted of 20-22 long 8-pounder guns. He speculates that if Kent had carried 18 or 24-pounder carronades instead of the long 6-pounders, she {{might have been able to}} use grapeshot to deter boarding. He further reports that in addition to her crew of 100 or so, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> 38 male and three female passengers, including seven or eight passengers that she had picked up at St. Salvador, after a fire there had destroyed the Indiaman Queen on 9 July. Apparently some four or five passengers were among the British dead, and there were also passengers among the wounded. James attributes the crew being overwhelmed by the boarders to a shortage of swords, pikes and pistols.|$|E
500|$|The teams {{wanted to}} [...] "maintain {{some sort of}} the Megan Fox allure" [...] but {{said that it was}} [...] "incredibly {{difficult}} because as soon as [...] warped her face in any direction, the shine kind of came off it". To combat this, they ended up focusing on anything below her nose, where they had the freedom to make things [...] "as horrific as [...] needed to" [...] and then above her nose, [...] " [...] could manipulate it somewhat with warps and color correction in her eye sockets. So even at her worst, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> of that sexiness throughout".|$|E
500|$|Five days later, the Queen {{noted that}} [...] "The Indians always wait now and do so, {{so well and}} quietly." [...] On 3 August, she wrote: [...] "I am {{learning}} {{a few words of}} Hindustani to speak to my servants.

500|$|Stafford's {{creation}} of Darlene Edwards {{had its roots}} in the novelty songs that Mitch Miller, the head of Columbia's artists and repertoire department, had been selecting for her to sing. These included songs such as [...] "Underneath the Overpass", and because she did not agree with Miller's music choices for her, Stafford and her studio musicians often recorded their own renditions of the music, performing the songs according to their feelings about them. Because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> unused studio time at a 1957 recording session, as a joke Stafford recorded a track as Darlene Edwards. Those who heard bootlegs of the recording responded positively, and later that year, Stafford and Weston recorded an album of songs as Jonathan and Darlene, entitled The Piano Artistry of Jonathan Edwards.|$|E
500|$|In March 1921, Shackleton renamed his {{expedition}} vessel Quest. She {{was a small}} ship, 125tons {{according to}} Huntford, with sail and auxiliary engine power purportedly capable of making eight knots, but in fact rarely making more than five-and-a-half. Huntford describes her as [...] "straight-stemmed", with an awkward square rig, and a tendency to wallow in heavy seas. Fisher reports that she was built in 1917, weighed 204tons, and had a large and spacious deck. Although <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> modern facilities, such as electric lights in the cabins, she was unsuited to long oceanic voyages; Shackleton, {{on the first day}} out, observed that [...] "in no way are we shipshape or fitted to ignore even the mildest storm". Leif Mills, in his biography of Frank Wild, says that had the ship been taken to the Beaufort Sea in accordance with Shackleton's original plans, she would probably have been crushed in the Arctic pack ice. On her voyage south she suffered frequent damage and breakdowns, requiring repairs at every port of call.|$|E
500|$|On {{the subject}} of {{returning}} for the sequel, Larter was chosen by New Line Cinema over her co-star Devon Sawa, who played as Alex Browning in the first film. [...] "We’ve brought back Clear in an interesting way and we just felt that to bring both of them back would make you wonder too much just what the hell they’d {{been doing for the}} past few months," [...] producer Craig Perry conveyed on developing the cliffhanger of Final Destination. Perry said that bringing back Clear over Alex was due to narrative reasons, stating that there were no financial problems that prevented Sawa from returning. He also observed that Clear is more knowledgeable in terms of mentoring the new protagonist and that she was utilized as the main link to the original film. Larter was delighted when New Line reinstated her and found it [...] "terrific" [...] that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> input into the script. As a result, Sawa's character was killed off-screen in Final Destination 2, as divulged by Clear to Kimberly during their first meeting.|$|E
