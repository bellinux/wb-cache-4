5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct <b>size</b> <b>classes,</b> small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species {{can be divided into}} two distinct <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider than those of the much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E
5|$|S. ciliata is a benthic {{carnivore}} {{that feeds}} predominantly on polychaetes and various crustaceans. Like {{other species of}} Sillago, the diet of the species {{is related to the}} size and age of the individual, with three distinct <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> identified in a study conducted in Botany Bay, NSW. The smallest fish of 0–10cm take large amount of amphipods and few polychaetes, while fish between 11 and 20cm consume mostly neried polychaetes and few amphipods. The largest fish over 21cm take large amounts of bivalve molluscs and shrimps of the genus Callianassa.|$|E

5|$|The {{sex of the}} {{different}} <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> was determined, not from the skulls, but from the pelvic bones. Contrary to what may be expected, the smaller size class had disproportionately large and wide-set pelvic bones. Bennett interpreted this as indicating a more spacious birth canal, through which eggs would pass. He concluded that the small size class with small, triangular crests represent females, and the larger, large-crested specimens represent males.|$|E
5|$|Hume {{notes that}} the skull of the Rodrigues {{starling}} {{was about the same}} size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The maxilla of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was sexually dimorphic. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but {{this may be due to}} individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, a drift gillnet fishery for {{the common}} {{thresher}} developed in southern California in 1977, beginning with 10 vessels experimenting with a larger-sized mesh. Within two years the fleet had increased to 40 vessels, and the fishery peaked in 1982 when 228 vessels landed 1,091 metric tons. The common thresher population rapidly collapsed from overfishing, with landings decreasing to less than 300 metric tons a year by the late 1980s and larger <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> disappearing from the population. Common threshers are still taken commercially in the United States, with about 85% coming from the Pacific and 15% from the Atlantic. The largest catches remain from the California-Oregon gillnet fishery, which had shifted its focus to the more valuable swordfish (Xiphius gladius) but still take threshers as bycatch. Small numbers of Pacific threshers are also taken by harpoons, small-mesh driftnets, and longlines. In the Atlantic, threshers are primarily taken on longlines meant for swordfish and tuna.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{demographics}} of the genus Acacia in Africa, despite its prominence and the economic and environmental importance of this group. The demographics and species composition of stands of four different Acacia species was investigated in the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve in northern Kwazulu-Natal in order to determine whether stands were self-replacing, or whether other Acacia species were invading them. Soil and stand density as well as the density and composition of the grass layer were investigated in order to determine whether any of these affected Acacia demography and species composition. In three out of four cases, the species whose large <b>size</b> <b>class</b> dominated the stand (known as the "stand species") was found to have a strongly bimodal <b>size</b> <b>class</b> distribution, skewed primarily towards the large <b>size</b> <b>class</b> and secondarily towards the small <b>size</b> <b>class.</b> Other Acacia species in the stands, with few or no large individuals present ("nonstand species") tended to have unimodal <b>size</b> <b>class</b> distributions, skewed primarily towards the small <b>size</b> <b>class</b> and secondarily towards the medium <b>size</b> <b>class.</b> Based on the proportion of small to large individuals, non-stand species are more likely to increase in overall numbers in future, suggesting that the species composition of the stands may be in a state of flux. Few relationships were found between stand density, grass density, grass composition and numbers of small and medium acacias. This could be as a result of differentiation between Acacia species, meaning that they cannot be analysed collectively. Furthermore, sample sizes of individual species may have been too small to analyse individually. Alternatively, it could mean that none of these factors {{have a significant effect on}} one another and that other explanations need to be found for the demographics of this genus...|$|R

25|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} is a predatory fish, taking {{a variety of}} {{crustaceans}} and other small prey items, with its exact diet varying both spatially and temporally. In northern Australia the most common prey items are ostracods, gastropods and euphausiids. The diet of individuals in India is more varied, with crustaceans, notably decapods and copepods making up {{the main part of}} the diet. Small fishes of the genus Anchoviella, pteropods, algal material, diatoms, molluscan larvae and foramanifera make up a lesser part of the diet here also. The species shows some diet partitioning between <b>size</b> <b>classes,</b> and during the year, the diet shifts as prey items vary in abundance. The species is diurnally active in India, while elsewhere in its range, nocturnal feeding has been reported. Unlike some of its relatives, feeding continues during spawning, with no apparent change in food preferences.|$|E
25|$|The torpedo scad, Megalaspis cordyla (also {{known as}} the hardtail scad, finny scad, finletted {{mackerel}} scad and cordyla scad), is a species of moderately large marine fish classified in the jack and horse mackerel family, Carangidae. The torpedo scad is distributed throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific region, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Tonga in the east, extending to Japan in the north and Australia in south. It is a schooling pelagic fish which occupies the surface layers of both inshore and offshore oceanic waters. The torpedo scad is easily identified by both its 'torpedo' shaped body and a series of detached finlets at the rear of both the dorsal and anal fins. The largest recorded individual was 80cm long and weighed 4 kg, although it is more common at lengths less than 40cm. It is a predatory species, taking a variety of fish, cephalopods and crustaceans by both active and filter feeding. There is a shift in diet as the species grow; however fish is the dominant prey in all <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> Torpedo scad reach sexual maturity at 22cm in females and 26.4cm in males, with spawning occurring between March and July in India, where significant research into larval growth and morphometrics has been carried out.|$|E

40|$|Benchmarking {{is often}} used in {{establishment}} surveys to adjust sample weights to match the current distribution {{of the population of}} interest. In the National Compensation Survey (NCS), an establishment survey of employer compensation costs conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the sample reference period is several quarters prior to the reference period for the estimates. Hence, the weight of each sampled establishment is adjusted to match the distribution of current employment by industry from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program. NCS data indicate that compensation costs also are correlated with establishment size. This research studies the effect of splitting each industry cell further by establishment <b>size</b> <b>class</b> for benchmarking purposes. Several <b>size</b> <b>class</b> partitions are being studied.

25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is an {{important}} species to commercial fisheries in parts of Asia, and as such has had significant research published on its biology and ecology. All of this information is published in relatively obscure Indian journals and is unavailable to most institutions. The torpedo scad is a predatory fish which both consumes larger prey and filter feeds to consume planktonic organisms. Larger prey items include a variety of fish and cephalopods including squid and cuttlefish. Smaller foods are mostly crustaceans such as shrimps, prawns, stomatopods, cladocerans and crabs. Molluscs and gastropods are also reported to be minor constituents of the diet of the species. The species also appears to have dietary shifts as it grows, however in all <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> fish are the dominant prey. Species recorded as being predators of torpedo scad include species of drums and requiem shark. Each sex of the torpedo scad reach sexual maturity at different lengths; females are mature by 22cm and males by 26.4cm. Other studies have suggested similar lengths, including 17cm in males and 27cm in females, {{as well as an}} average of 25cm in both sexes. Spawning has not been directly observed, however peaks in larval abundance are known from March to July, with a peak in June in India. the eggs are pelagic, and are spherical and transparent with a yolk and single oil globule. The larval stage is extensively described, with the species having 24 myomeres. The growth of the species is not reported, however numerous morphometric (length vs weight) studies have been carried out on the species. The population structure in Indian waters has also been well studied, with the most recent of these suggesting a major recruitment event occurs between May and August. These studies also guide fisheries regulations, with a theoretical maximum yield achieved when fish are only taken once they reach 18cm.|$|E
25|$|The giant {{trevally}} is {{a powerful}} predatory fish, from the estuaries it inhabits as a juvenile to the outer reefs and atolls it patrols as an adult. Hunting appears to occur {{at different times of}} the day in different areas of its range; off South Africa it is most active during the day, especially at dawn and dusk, while off Zanzibar and Hong Kong, it is nocturnal in its habits. The species' diets have been determined in several countries and habitats; their diets generally vary slightly by locations and age. In all but one study (which was of juveniles), the giant trevally dominantly takes other fishes, with various crustaceans, cephalopods and occasionally molluscs making the remainder of the diet. In Hawaii, the species has a predominantly fish-based diet consisting of Scaridae and Labridae, with crustaceans, including lobsters, and cephalopods (squid and octopus) making up the remaining portion. The large number of reef fishes suggests it spends much of its time foraging over shallow-water reef habitats, but the presence of squid and the schooling carangid Decapterus macarellus indicates exploitation of more open-water habitats, as well. Off Africa, the diet is similar, consisting mostly of fish including eels, with minor squid, octopus, mantis shrimp, lobsters and other crustaceans. Younger fish inside Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii showed the only instance where crustaceans were preferred over fish; stomatopods, shrimp and crabs were the most common prey taken at 89% of stomach content by volume, with fish, mostly of the family Blennidae, making up only 7% of the stomach contents. Estuarine fish in both Hawaii and Australia have mostly fish-based diets, with crustaceans such as prawns and amphipods also of importance, and they are known to take more novel prey, such as spiders and insects, in these habitats. Juvenile turtles and dolphins were reported being found within the stomach contents of larger giant trevally. Studies of different <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of fish have found their diets change with age in some locations, with the changes relating to an increased volume of fish taken.|$|E

40|$|The gross job {{gains and}} gross job loss {{statistics}} from the BLS Business Employment Dynamics (BED) program measure the large gross job flows that underlie the quarterly net change in employment.

This growth is the sum of 8. 1 million gross job gains from opening and expanding establishments, and 7. 2 million gross job losses from contracting and closing establishments. The new BED data have captured the attention of economists and policymakers across the country, and these data are becoming a major contributor to our understanding of employment growth and business cycles in the U.
