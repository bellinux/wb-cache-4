25|$|Jameson’s {{research}} {{showed that}} the kinetics of flotation of fine particles was a strong function of the bubble diameter and {{that the way to}} improve recoveries was to use small bubbles in the order of 300µm in diameter. What was needed was a practical method of making such bubbles in large quantities, of the order of billions per second. The device needed to be simple to construct and operate, capable of running for long periods with minimal maintenance, and should be resistant to blockage by stray large particles in the feed. He began to look at the theory of bubble breakup in sheared flows, that is, in flow fields in which layers of liquid slide over each other. Lewis and Davidson had recently published a theory to predict the maximum size of bubbles in a well-characterised flow environment. By balancing the forces acting on a bubble in a shearing flow, including the disruptive dynamic stresses from the liquid motion and the restoring force of surface tension, it was possible to predict the critical <b>shear</b> <b>rate</b> required to produce a bubble of given size. Jameson then looked for simple and practical ways of generating the required shear rates, and found inspiration in the kitchen sink. If a jet of water from a tap plunges into a basin full of water, a shear layer develops around the jet, that entrains air from the atmosphere into the water, and at the same time, breaks up the entrained air into fine bubbles. The effect is magnified if there is a detergent in the water. Detergents, known as frothers, are used in flotation to prevent bubble coalescence, and to create stable froths. By the correct choice of jet velocity and diameter, it is possible to provide a controlled shear environment that can generate bubbles of a suitable size for flotation, with the added advantage that the air is naturally aspirated by the jet, so {{there is no need for}} a compressor or blower. Thus the idea of the Jameson Cell was born.|$|E

40|$|Atherothrombosis can induce acute {{myocardial}} infarction and stroke by progressive stenosis of a blood vessel lumen to full occlusion. The goal {{of this research is}} to determine what <b>shear</b> <b>rates</b> are pertinent to an occluding blood vessel, the rate of thrombus growth relative to wall <b>shear</b> <b>rates,</b> and to develop a predictive model for estimating length of time to thrombus occlusion for a given atherosclerotic lesion. Computational studies of severely stenotic idealized vessels were performed to investigate the wall <b>shear</b> <b>rates</b> that may exist. The study shows that maximum <b>shear</b> <b>rates</b> in severe short stenoses were found to exceed 250, 000 1 /s (9, 500 dynes/cm 2). We utilize an in vitro experiment consisting of blood flow through a collagen coated stenosis to study the rate of thrombus growth. Growth is monitored through light microscopy and a camera. Computational fluid dynamics are used to determine <b>shear</b> <b>rates</b> along the thrombus surface as it grows. We found a strong positive correlation between thrombus growth <b>rates</b> and <b>shear</b> <b>rates</b> up to 6, 000 1 /s after a log-log transformation (r= 0. 85, p< 0. 0001). Growth <b>rates</b> at pathologic <b>shear</b> <b>rates</b> were typically 2 - 4 times greater than for physiologic <b>shear</b> <b>rates</b> below 400 s- 1. To determine whether transport or kinetic binding limits the rate of thrombus growth, a computational model of platelet transport was developed. The model allows for thrombus growth by occluding computational cells. We show that thrombus is transport rate-limited for <b>shear</b> <b>rates</b> below 6, 000 1 /s, while it {{is more likely to be}} kinetic rate-limited for higher <b>shear</b> <b>rates.</b> Predictions of occlusion times based on the model demonstrate that increases in stenosis severity results in decreased time to occlusion.

2500|$|Protein {{precipitate}} formation {{occurs in a}} stepwise process. [...] First, a precipitating agent is added and the solution is steadily mixed. [...] Mixing causes the precipitant and protein to collide. Enough mixing time is required for molecules to diffuse across the fluid eddies. [...] Next, proteins undergo a nucleation phase, where submicroscopic sized protein aggregates, or particles, are generated. Growth of these particles is under Brownian diffusion control. Once the particles reach a critical size (0.1 µm to 10 µm for high and low shear fields, respectively), by diffusive addition of individual protein molecules to it, they continue to grow by colliding into each other and sticking or flocculating. This phase occurs at a slower rate. During the final step, called aging in a shear field, the precipitate particles repeatedly collide and stick, then break apart, until a stable mean particle size is reached, which is dependent upon individual proteins. The mechanical strength of the protein particles correlates with {{the product of the}} mean <b>shear</b> <b>rate</b> and the aging time, which is known as the Camp number. Aging helps particles withstand the fluid shear forces encountered in pumps and centrifuge feed zones without reducing in size.|$|E

30|$|The {{results show}} that the {{viscosity}} of the linear polymers decreases with the increased <b>shear</b> <b>rates,</b> exhibiting pseudoplastic behavior. However, there was an initial increase in the viscosity of the HAHPAM and polymer–surfactant with the rising <b>shear</b> <b>rates</b> (γ̇[*]<[*] 0.2  s− 1). Most of the conventional polymer fluids are known to show Newtonian behavior at low <b>shear</b> <b>rates,</b> exactly like the linear polymer performs at low <b>shear</b> <b>rates</b> in Fig.  6. Because the structural morphology caused by either hydrophobic grouping or surfactant micelle-like aggregations exists in the two polymers (HAHPAM and polymer–surfactant) at low <b>shear</b> <b>rates,</b> the forces driving the molecular chains oriented towards the shearing direction (shear thinning) are smaller than the forces directing the molecular aggregations that are getting close to each other to form a temporary larger structure (similar to the shear thickening phenomenon of suspending liquid). Therefore, at low <b>shear</b> <b>rates,</b> the initial rise in the viscosity of the two polymers (HAHPAM and polymer–surfactant) occurred. With the increase in the <b>shear</b> <b>rates,</b> the former factor is coming to play a key role, indicating a shear-thinning effect. We suspect that the high shear thinning of the polymer–surfactant and HAHPAM is a consequence of the uncoiling and aligning of the polymer chains along the flow direction.|$|R
2500|$|Commercial {{tomato ketchup}} has an additive, usually xanthan gum, {{which gives the}} {{condiment}} a pseudoplastic or [...] "shear thinning" [...] property - more commonly known as thixotropic. This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount added—usually 0.5%—which can {{make it difficult to}} pour from a container. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures that when a force is applied to the ketchup it will lower the viscosity enabling the sauce to flow. A common method to getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom with the heel of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. A technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together). Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup glass bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct shearing force. These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases with increasing <b>shear</b> <b>rate.</b> The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed the ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.|$|E
