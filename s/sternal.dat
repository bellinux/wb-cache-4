5|$|Andreacarus voalavo is a {{parasitic}} mite {{found on}} the Malagasy rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus. First described in 2007, it {{is closely related to}} Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, which are found on other Malagasy rodents. The length of the idiosoma, the main body, is 630 to 670μm in females and 450 to 480μm in males. Unlike A.eliurus, this species lacks distinct <b>sternal</b> glands (secretory organs) between two lyrifissures (sensory organs) on {{the lower part of the}} female body. The pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the chelicera, is serrate, which distinguishes it from A.gymnuromys. Females of A.gymnuromys also have a less ornamented <b>sternal</b> shield (covering part of the underparts) and shorter setae (bristles) on the upperparts.|$|E
5|$|A {{skeleton}} of Deinonychus, including bones {{from the original}} (and most complete) AMNH 3015 specimen, {{can be seen on}} display at the American Museum of Natural History, with another specimen (MCZ 4371) on display at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. The American Museum and Harvard specimens are from a different locality than the Yale specimens. Even these two skeletal mounts are lacking elements, including the sterna, <b>sternal</b> ribs, furcula, and gastralia.|$|E
5|$|In the female, the pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the {{chelicera}} (mouthpart), is serrate, not {{smooth as}} in A.gymnuromys. The idiosoma (main {{part of the}} body) is 630 to 670μm long and 370 to 435μm wide and the dorsal shield (covering the upper side) is 620 to 655μm long and 360 to 370μm wide. The dorsal setae (bristles) are long relative to A.gymnuromys. The <b>sternal</b> shield (on the lower {{side of the body}}) is 115 to 125μm long and 184 to 200μm wide and is more ornamented than in A.gymnuromys. Unlike A.eliurus, A.voalavo lacks distinct <b>sternal</b> glands (secretory organs) between the lyrifissures (sensory organs) iv1 and iv2 on the lower side of the body. The other shields on the lower side of the body are the genitoventral shield (232 to 253 by 170 to 182μm), the peritrematic shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm), and the anal shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm). On the soft part of the cuticle, there are nine pairs of setae. The first segments of the legs, the coxae, lack hooks. On the coxae of the third pair of legs, the setae at the back are spur-like.|$|E
5|$|Most {{termites}} are blind, so communication primarily occurs through chemical, {{mechanical and}} pheromonal cues. These {{methods of communication}} are used {{in a variety of}} activities, including foraging, locating reproductives, construction of nests, recognition of nestmates, nuptial flight, locating and fighting enemies, and defending the nests. The most common way of communicating is through antennation. A number of pheromones are known, including contact pheromones (which are transmitted when workers are engaged in trophallaxis or grooming) and alarm, trail and sex pheromones. The alarm pheromone and other defensive chemicals are secreted from the frontal gland. Trail pheromones are secreted from the <b>sternal</b> gland, and sex pheromones derive from two glandular sources: the <b>sternal</b> and tergal glands. When termites go out to look for food, they forage in columns along the ground through vegetation. A trail can be identified by the faecal deposits or runways that are covered by objects. Workers leave pheromones on these trails, which are detected by other nestmates through olfactory receptors. Termites can also communicate through mechanical cues, vibrations, and physical contact. These signals are frequently used for alarm communication or for evaluating a food source.|$|E
5|$|The puffball {{was used}} by the Chippewa people of North America as a charm, and medicinally as a hemostat. In British Columbia, Canada, it is used by {{livestock}} farmers who are not allowed to use conventional drugs under certified organic programs. The spore mass of the puffball is applied to bleeding hoof trimming 'nicks', and then wrapped with breathable first-aid tape. It is also similarly used on bleeding areas resulting from disbudding, and wounds resulting from <b>sternal</b> abscesses.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{the section}} behind the metathorax, {{made up of}} a series of rings, each with a hole for {{breathing}} and respiration, called a spiracle, composing three different segmented sclerites: the tergum, pleura, and the sternum. The tergum in almost all species is membranous, or usually soft and concealed by the wings and elytra when not in flight. The pleura are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single spiracle. The sternum is the most widely visible part of the abdomen, being a more or less sclerotized segment. The abdomen itself does not have any appendages, but some (for example, Mordellidae) have articulating <b>sternal</b> lobes.|$|E
5|$|The right lung {{has both}} more lobes and {{segments}} than the left. It {{is divided into}} three lobes, an upper, middle, and a lower, by two fissures, one oblique and one horizontal. The upper, horizontal fissure, separates the upper from the middle lobe. It begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior border of the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border on a level with the <b>sternal</b> end of the fourth costal cartilage; on the mediastinal surface it may be traced backward to the hilum.|$|E
5|$|Zhenyuanlong {{preserves}} wing feathers {{that are}} aerodynamically shaped, with particularly bird-like coverts {{as opposed to}} the longer, wider-spanning coverts of forms like Archaeopteryx and Anchiornis, as well as fused <b>sternal</b> plates. Due to its size and short arms it is unlikely that Zhenyuanlong was capable of powered flight (though the importance of biomechanical modelling in this regard is stressed), but it may suggest a relatively close descendance from flying ancestors, or even some capacity for gliding or wing-assisted incline running.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where males and females were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males and females. These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh <b>sternal</b> glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{behaviour}} {{depends on}} the type of termite. For example, certain species feed on the wood structures they inhabit, and others harvest food that is near the nest. Most workers are rarely found out in the open, and do not forage unprotected; they rely on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators. Subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food, and workers who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a phagostimulant pheromone that attracts workers. Foraging workers use semiochemicals to communicate with each other, and workers who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their <b>sternal</b> glands. In one species, Nasutitermes costalis, there are three phases in a foraging expedition: first, soldiers scout an area. When they find a food source, they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of workers starts to emerge. In the second phase, workers appear in large numbers at the site. The third phase is marked by a {{decrease in the number of}} soldiers present and an increase in the number of workers. Isolated termite workers may engage in Lévy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or foraging for food.|$|E
5|$|The dodo {{had about}} {{nineteen}} presynsacral vertebrae (those {{of the neck}} and thorax, including three fused into a notarium), sixteen synsacral vertebrae (those of the lumbar region and sacrum), six free tail (caudal) vertebrae, and a pygostyle. The neck had well-developed areas for muscle and ligament attachment, probably to support the heavy skull and beak. On each side, it had six ribs, four of which articulated with the sternum through <b>sternal</b> ribs. The sternum was large, but small {{in relation to the}} body compared to those of much smaller pigeons that are able to fly. The sternum was highly pneumatic, broad, and relatively thick in cross-section. The bones of the pectoral girdle, shoulder blades, and wing bones were reduced in size compared to those of flighted pigeon, and were more gracile compared to those of the Rodrigues solitaire, but none of the individual skeletal components had disappeared. The carpometacarpus of the dodo was more robust than that of the solitaire, however. The pelvis was wider than that of the solitaire and other relatives, yet was comparable to the proportions in some smaller, flighted pigeons. Most of the leg bones were more robust than those of extant pigeons and the solitaire, but the length proportions were little different.|$|E
5|$|Though the broad-billed parrot {{may have}} fed {{on the ground}} and been a weak flier, its tarsometatarsus was short and stout, {{implying}} some arboreal characteristics. The Newton brothers and many authors after them inferred that it was flightless, due to the apparent short wings and large size shown in the 1601 Gelderland sketch. According to Hume, the underlying pencil sketch actually shows that the wings are not particularly short. They appear broad, as they commonly are in forest-adapted species, and the alula appears large, a feature of slow-flying birds. Its <b>sternal</b> keel was reduced, but not enough to prevent flight, as the adept flying Cyanoramphus parrots also have reduced keels, and even the flightless kakapo, with its vestigial keel, is capable of gliding. Furthermore, Hoffman's account states that it could fly, albeit with difficulty, and the first published illustration shows the bird on top of a tree, an improbable position for a flightless bird. The broad-billed parrot may have been behaviourally near-flightless, like the now-extinct Norfolk Island kaka.|$|E
25|$|Male M. flavitarsis have larger sixth, seventh, {{and eighth}} <b>sternal</b> glands than other wasps, {{suggesting}} {{a role in}} secretion and possible sexual attractant. Secretion is suggested because the wasps will often rub their abdomens along the nest, spreading a highly repellant substance to deter ants. The use of secretion is also used by males when trying to attract a female because they will rub their abdomen along the perimeter of their perching territory. Near the openings of the glands are <b>sternal</b> brushes, which assist in rubbing the secreted substance along the surface. <b>Sternal</b> brushes occur only in the M. flavitarsis of the Mischocyttarus genus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sternal</b> {{fractures}} {{are frequently}} associated with underlying injuries such as pulmonary contusions, or bruised lung tissue.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sternal</b> plate: Oval, 0.27- 0.30mm {{in length}} {{and a little more}} than twice as long as wide.|$|E
25|$|A {{somewhat}} rare congenital {{disorder of}} the sternum {{sometimes referred to}} as an anatomical variation is a <b>sternal</b> foramen, a single round hole in the sternum that is present from birth and usually is off-centered to the right or left, commonly forming in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th segments of the breastbone body. Congenital <b>sternal</b> foramens can often be mistaken for bullet holes. They are usually without symptoms but can be problematic if acupuncture in the area is intended.|$|E
25|$|The breast {{meridian}} for {{the length}} of the sternum bone (from the <b>sternal</b> notch at the lower-throat) to the xiphoid process (at the lower tip).|$|E
25|$|The upper {{border is}} oval and articulates with the manubrium, at the <b>sternal</b> angle. The lower border is narrow, and articulates with the xiphoid process.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sternal</b> {{portion of}} the muscle is {{sometimes}} wanting and more rarely defects occur in the lateral part of the central tendon or adjoining muscle fibers.|$|E
25|$|Avoid {{sitting in}} the car front seat (no driving) {{for at least four}} weeks: the {{explosion}} of the deployment of an airbag could refracture the <b>sternal</b> union.|$|E
25|$|A bifid sternum is an {{extremely}} rare congenital abnormality caused by the fusion failure of the sternum. This condition results in <b>sternal</b> cleft which can be observed at birth without any symptom.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sternal</b> head is a round fasciculus, {{tendinous}} in front, fleshy behind, {{arising from}} {{the upper part of}} the front of the manubrium sterni. It travels superiorly, laterally, and posteriorly.|$|E
25|$|The {{triangle}} {{formed by}} the clavicle and the <b>sternal</b> and clavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle {{is used as a}} landmark in identifiyng the correct location for central venous catheterization.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis: Capitulum as in female, hypostome {{dentition}} mainly 2/2, 3/3 distally; scutum {{about as}} long as wide with lateral carinae; <b>sternal</b> plate present, oval; anal grooves converging posteriorly but remaining narrowly open; legs as in female.|$|E
25|$|Confuciusornis has {{traditionally}} been assumed {{to have been a}} competent flier based on its extremely long wings with strongly asymmetrical feathers. Other adaptations for improved flight capabilities include: a fused wrist, a short tail, an ossified sternum with a central keel, a strut-like coracoid, a large deltopectoral crest, a strong ulna and an enlarged second metacarpal. The <b>sternal</b> keel and deltopectoral crest (which provides a more powerful upstroke) are adaptations to flapping flight in modern birds, indicating that Confuciusornis may have been capable of the same. However, it may have had a different flight stroke due to being incapable of rotating its arm behind the body, and its relatively smaller <b>sternal</b> keel indicates that it likely was not capable of flight for extended periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{secretions}} from dorsal abdominal or <b>sternal</b> exocrine glands {{are used}} to attract mates by certain species of jewel bugs. In certain genera (like Tectocoris, Psacasta, Odontoscelis, and Irochrotus), males possess special unicellular glands in the abdomen known as the androconia (singular: androconium). They release sex pheromones when ruptured.|$|E
25|$|In cattle, the {{symptoms}} may include drooling, restlessness, uncoordination, urine retention, dysphagia, and <b>sternal</b> recumbency. Laterally recumbent animals are usually {{very close to}} death. In sheep, {{the symptoms}} may include drooling, a serous nasal discharge, stiffness, and incoordination. Abdominal respiration may be observed and the tail may switch on the side. As the disease progresses, the limbs may become paralyzed and death may occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} examination {{of an individual}} with aortic insufficiency involves auscultation of the heart to listen for the murmur of aortic insufficiency and the S3 heart sound (S3 gallop correlates with development of LV dysfunction). The murmur of chronic aortic insufficiency is typically described as early diastolic and decrescendo, which is best heard in the third left intercostal space and may radiate along the left <b>sternal</b> border.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis: A {{very large}} tick when fully engorged; scutum {{about as long}} as broad and {{broadest}} a little posterior to mid length, with strong lateral carinae; capitulum relatively long porose areas deep, cornua usually absent, but when present at most only mild and rounded; auriculae present; hypostome lanceolate, dentition mainly 3/3; no <b>sternal</b> plate; anal grooves meeting at a point behind; all coxae with an external spur decreasing in size posteriorly; trochanters III and IV usually with small, pointed ventral spurs.|$|E
25|$|When two are present, {{they are}} {{generally}} situated one above the other, the upper being the larger; the second piece has seldom more than one; the third, fourth, and fifth pieces are often formed from two centers placed laterally, the irregular union of which explains the rare occurrence of the <b>sternal</b> foramen , or of the vertical fissure which occasionally intersects {{this part of the}} bone constituting the malformation known as fissura sterni; these conditions are further explained by {{the manner in which the}} cartilaginous sternum is formed.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{electrodes}} may rarely {{be placed}} to generate other leads for specific diagnostic purposes. Right-sided precordial leads {{may be used}} to better study pathology of the right ventricle or for dextrocardia (and are denoted with an R (e.g., V5R)). Posterior leads (V7 to V9) {{may be used to}} demonstrate the presence of a posterior myocardial infarction. A Lewis lead (requiring an electrode at the right <b>sternal</b> border in the second intercostal space) can be used to study pathological rhythms arising in the right atrium.|$|E
25|$|The holotype specimen, MPM-PV 1156, {{consists}} of a partial skeleton, somewhat preserved in its original layout, that comprises: a maxilla (jaw) fragment; a tooth; a posterior cervical vertebra; cervical ribs; multiple dorsal vertebrae and dorsal ribs; the sacrum; 32 caudal vertebrae and 18 haemal arches (bones from the tail) that include a sequence of 17 anterior and middle caudal vertebrae and their corresponding haemal arches found in their original layout; the left pectoral girdle and forelimb minus the front foot; both <b>sternal</b> plates; all pelvic elements; the left hind limb lacking a hind foot and right tibia; metatarsals I and II; and one claw from digit I.|$|E
25|$|Surgically, {{the breast}} is an apocrine gland {{overlaying}} the chest — attached at the nipple and suspended with ligaments from the chest — which {{is integral to}} the skin, the body integument of the woman. The dimensions and weight of the breasts vary with her age and habitus (body build and physical constitution); hence small-to-medium-sized breasts weigh approximately 500 gm, or less, and large breasts weigh approximately 750–1,000 gm. Anatomically, the breast topography and the hemispheric locale of the nipple-areola complex (NAC) are particular to each woman; thus, the desirable, average measurements are a 21–23cm <b>sternal</b> distance (nipple to sternum-bone notch), and a 5–7cm inferior-limb distance (NAC to IMF).|$|E
25|$|The body, or gladiolus, is {{the longest}} part. It is flat and {{considered}} to have only a front and back surface. It is flat on the front, directed upward and forward, and marked by three transverse ridges which cross the bone opposite the third, fourth, and fifth articular depressions. The pectoralis major attaches to it on either side. At the junction of {{the third and fourth}} parts of the body is occasionally seen an orifice, the <b>sternal</b> foramen, of varying size and form. The posterior surface, slightly concave, is also marked by three transverse lines, less distinct, however, than those in front; from its lower part, on either side, the transversus thoracis takes origin.|$|E
25|$|Tinamous have a pneumaticized {{skeleton}} with a <b>sternal</b> keel, 16–18 cervical vertebrae, and fused thoracic vertebrae. They have poor circulation, {{evidenced by}} a greenish tint to the skin. They also have relatively the smallest hearts and lungs of all birds, comprising only 1.6–3.1% {{of their body}} weight, whereas the equivalent in a domestic chicken is 12%. Despite their poor flying ability, the percentage of their body mass that is muscle is 28.6–40%, {{which is similar to}} that of hummingbirds. The preen gland is small and tufted. The male has a corkscrew shaped penis, similar to those of the ratites and to the hemipenis of some reptiles. The female has a small phallic organ in the cloaca which becomes larger during the breeding season.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimation}} {{of age in}} bioarchaeology and osteology actually refers to an approximation of skeletal or biological age-at-death. The primary assumption in age estimation is that an individual's skeletal age is closely associated with their chronological age. Age estimation can be based on patterns of growth and development or degenerative changes in the skeleton. Many methods tracking these types of changes have been developed {{using a variety of}} skeletal series. For instance, in children age is typically estimated by assessing their dental development, ossification and fusion of specific skeletal elements, or long bone length. In adults, degenerative changes to the pubic symphysis, the auricular surface of the ilium, the <b>sternal</b> end of the 4th rib, and dental attrition are commonly used to estimate skeletal age.|$|E
