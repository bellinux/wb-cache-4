"I have a <b>state-coach</b> at Carlton House, [...] A chariot in Seymour-place;[35] [...] 20 [...] But they're lent to two friends, {{who make}} me amends [...] By driving my {{favourite}} pace: [...] And they handle their reins {{with such a}} grace, [...] I have something for both {{at the end of}} the race.|$|E

"Now don't {{laugh at}} this relic, {{for it is}} very curious, though you won't {{appreciate}} it as a woman would;" [...] and Dolly unfolded an old-fashioned housewife of red velvet, lined with faded yellow damask. [...] "That was made by my dear mother out of {{a bit of the}} velvet lining of the Governor's <b>state-coach,</b> and the coverlet that a French Comte tore with his spurs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see, when Madam married Captain Scott {{many of the}} Governor's {{things were}} taken from her, among them the <b>state-coach.</b> By the way, {{it is said to}} be in {{existence}} now, stored away in somebody's barn down in Portland. You had better go and sketch it," [...] began Dolly, smoothing out the old housewife, and evidently glad to tell the little story of the ancestress whom she was said to resemble, though she modestly refrained from mentioning a fact of which she was immensely proud.|$|E
60|$|On the whole, we {{will say}} our new Mayor Bailly; our new Commander Lafayette, named also 'Scipio-Americanus,' have bought their preferment dear. Bailly rides in gilt <b>state-coach,</b> with beefeaters and sumptuosity; Camille Desmoulins, and others, {{sniffing}} {{at him for}} it: Scipio bestrides the 'white charger,' and waves with civic plumes in sight of all France. Neither of them, however, does it for nothing; but, in truth, at an exorbitant rate. At this rate, namely: of feeding Paris, and keeping it from fighting. Out of the City-funds, some seventeen thousand of the utterly destitute are employed digging on Montmartre, at tenpence a day, which buys them, at market price, almost two pounds of bad bread;--they look very yellow, when Lafayette goes to harangue them. The Townhall is in travail, night and day; it must bring forth Bread, a Municipal Constitution, regulations of all kinds, curbs on the Sansculottic Press; above all, Bread, Bread.|$|E
6000|$|But the Lord mayor's Day is {{the great}} anniversary. The Lord Mayor is looked up to by the {{inhabitants}} of Little Britain as the greatest potentate upon earth; his gilt coach with six horses as the summit of human splendor; and his procession, with all the Sheriffs and Aldermen in his train, as the grandest of earthly pageants. How they exult in {{the idea that the}} King himself dare not enter the city without first knocking at the gate of Temple Bar, and asking permission of the Lord Mayor: for if he did, heaven and earth! there is no knowing what might be the consequence. The man in armor, who rides before the Lord mayor, and is the city champion, has orders to cut down everybody that offends against the dignity of the city; {{and then there is the}} little man with a velvet porringer on his head, who sits at the window of the <b>state-coach,</b> and holds the city sword, as long as a pike-staff--Odd's blood! If he once draws that sword, Majesty itself is not safe! ...|$|E
60|$|Sidney {{was to be}} {{presented}} at the after-dinner reception at the Louvre the next day, and Sir Francis proposed to take young Ribaumont with him. Berenger coloured, and spoke of his equipment, and Sidney good-naturedly offered to come and inspect. That young gentleman {{was one of the}} daintiest in apparel of his day; but he was amazed that the suit in which Berenger had paid his devoir to Queen Elizabeth should have been set aside--it was of pearl-grey velvet, slashed with rose-coloured satin, and in shape and fashion point-device--unless, as the Ambassador said good-humouredly, 'my young Lord Ribaumont wished to be one of Monsieur's clique.' Thus arrayed, then, and with the chaplet of pearls bound round the small cap, with a heron-plume that sat jauntily on one side of his fair curled head, Berenger took his seat beside the hazel-eyed, brown-haired Sidney, in his white satin and crimson, and with the Ambassador and his attendants were rolled off in the great <b>state-coach</b> drawn by eight horses, which had no sinecure in dragging the ponderous machine through the unsavoury debris of the streets.|$|E
6000|$|Who would govern {{that can}} get along without governing? He that is fittest for it, is of all men the unwillingest unless constrained. By multifarious devices we have been endeavoring to {{dispense}} with governing; and by very superficial speculations, of laissez-faire, supply-and-demand, &c. &c. to persuade ourselves that it is best so. The Real Captain, unless it be some Captain of mechanical Industry hired by Mammon, where is he in these days? Most likely, in silence, in sad isolation somewhere, in remote obscurity; trying if, in an evil ungoverned time, he cannot at least govern himself. The Real Captain undiscoverable; the Phantasm Captain everywhere very conspicuous:--it is thought Phantasm Captains, aided by ballot-boxes, are the true method, after all. They are much the pleasantest for the time being! And so no Dux or Duke of any sort, in any province of our affairs, now leads: the Duke's Bailiff leads, what little leading is required for getting in the rents; and the Duke merely rides in the <b>state-coach.</b> It is everywhere so: and now at last we see a world all rushing towards strange consummations, because it is and has long been so! ...|$|E
