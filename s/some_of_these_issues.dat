5|$|In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{approved}} a plan first introduced in 1992 by California's state government. The {{plan called for}} major cleanup of the lower river {{in order to protect}} salmon from phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand. It also expressed concern over high water temperatures, algal blooms, and low oxygen levels, although certain fish have adapted to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b> Environmental groups, more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others have worked with the EPA to reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers felt {{part of the}} failings laid {{with the}} {{underdeveloped}} characters despite them being slightly different from usual anime stock characters. The story neither properly introduces them nor explains their backgrounds and motivations, making them hard to identify with. Eko's menace only came by force and not by his personality or schemes, making him a weak villain. DVD Talk {{found it hard to}} piece together the relationship between the main characters, but acknowledged the later half addressed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> by revealing the background of some characters. They felt the revelations fleshed out Otoha's personality and motivation, helping viewers to sympathize and identify with the protagonist.|$|E
5|$|Several {{problems}} were experienced with the iPhone 5S's hardware after its release. The most widely reported {{issue is that}} the angle reported by the phone's level sensor had drifted by several degrees, which caused the gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer to become inaccurate. Reports suggested {{that this is a}} hardware-induced problem. Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting, the power button making a rattling noise when the phone was shaken, overheating, the microphone not working, and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> have been fixed by software updates.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} eco issues in bulk {{materials}} handling in ports. Solid, free-flowing materials {{are said to}} be in bulk. Bulk materials handling is very difficult, because it incorporates all the features of liquids, gasses and mass solids. Energy efficiency, dust emissions in nearby environment, dust explosions, jamming, noise, handling of hazardous materials and protection of materials from contamination are issues that will be considered in this paper. Here are also presented possible solutions for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issue...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1939, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were <b>issued</b> overprinted {{with their}} face value in large black numerals, {{in order to}} help {{distinguish}} these values from others which had a similar colour. Twenty eight <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were <b>issued</b> ranging from 3s6d to £1000.|$|R
5|$|The {{subsidiarity}} principle resolves <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b> The term originates {{from social}} thought within the Catholic Church and states that no larger organ shall resolve {{an issue that}} can be resolved at a more local level. It {{can be compared to}} federalist principles where entities of the union retain some aspects of sovereignty. Only when two or more members of the federation are affected by any given act does the federal government have the authority to intervene. Giving a reformed UN more powers but enshrining the subsidiarity principle in its Charter would guarantee that the UN does not evolve into a world autocracy that can arbitrarily dictate policy.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{major issue}} of photojournalism is photo manipulation– what degree is acceptable? Some {{pictures}} are simply manipulated for color enhancement, whereas others are manipulated {{to the extent}} where people are edited {{in or out of}} the picture. War photography has always been a genre of photojournalism that is frequently staged – see [...] for early examples. Due to the bulkiness and types of cameras present during past wars in history, it was rare when a photograph could capture a spontaneous news event. Subjects were carefully composed and staged in order to capture better images. Another ethical issue is false or misleading captioning.

25|$|Pullapilly has {{suggested}} that the Nairs may share a common heritage with the Ezhava caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history.

25|$|Both {{have higher}} risks than a vaginal birth with no {{previous}} caesarean section. There are many issues {{which must be}} taken into account when planning the mode of delivery for every pregnancy, not just those complicated by a previous caesarean section and there is a list of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> in the list of indications for section in the first part of this article. A vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) confers a higher risk of uterine rupture (5 per 1,000), blood transfusion or endometritis (10 per 1,000), and perinatal death of the child (0.25 per 1,000). Furthermore, 20% to 40% of planned VBAC attempts end in caesarean section being needed, with greater risks of complications in an emergency repeat caesarean section than in an elective repeat caesarean section. On the other hand, VBAC confers less maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than elective repeat caesarean section.|$|E
25|$|This {{concept of}} decisively {{altering}} genes has {{coined the concept}} of the Designer Baby. Currently, PGD can alter some physical and health attributes, and projections for the future power of PGD in its ability to create the ideal human has raised many ethical issues. Projections for societal repercussions include changing the realm of athletics, creating human weapons, and exchanging autonomy over one’s life course for predesignation. Also, with a limited view of the future, it is difficult to alter a human’s genetic makeup without knowing full repercussions. For example, through gene therapy, a lab was able to make rats lose weight, but the long-term effects of the gene manipulation lead to worry of toxin production and too much weight loss. To prevent <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> from arising, scientists work towards stabilising the entire process to make it safer before applying a higher degree of gene modification to the human embryos in IVF.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of the {{instrument}} peripherals for World Tour were mixed.

500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> were {{addressed}} {{during the second}} Device programme from 1544 onwards. Italian ideas began to be brought in, although the impact of Henry's foreign engineers {{seems to have been}} limited, and the designs themselves lagged behind those used in his French territories. The emerging continental approach used angled, [...] "arrow-head" [...] bastions, linked in a line called a trace italienne, to provide supporting fire against any attacker. Sandown Castle on the Isle of Wight, constructed in 1545, was a hybrid of traditional English and continental ideas, with angular bastions combined with a circular bastion overlooking the sea. Southsea Castle and Sharpenode Fort had similar, angular bastions. Yarmouth Castle, finished by 1547, was the first fortification in England, to adopt the new arrow-headed bastion design, which had further advantages over a simple angular bastion. Not all the forts in the second wave of work embraced the Italian approach however, and some, such as Brownsea Castle, retained the existing, updated architectural style.|$|E
500|$|Wohlwend's friend Benedict Fritz {{developed}} {{a prototype of}} a mechanical arcade game from a bar that they frequented in Chicago. When Wohlwend saw the video of Ice Cold Beer online, they began work on an open world, dungeon crawl version of the game, which became TumbleSeed. They also worked through a Cards Against Humanity game incubation program in 2015, and several other indie developers based in Chicago joined the production. Based on the project's loose, collaboratory nature, Metro called the game's pedigree [...] "as indie as indie gaming gets". With {{the announcement of the}} Nintendo Switch, the development team sought to become a [...] "flagship" [...] demonstration of the console's HD Rumble feature, in which the player proprioceptively [...] "feels" [...] in-game textures through the controller's fine-tuned vibrations. They cold-called Nintendo and began work together in June 2016, prior to the Switch's announcement. TumbleSeed was released on May 2, 2017, on Nintendo Switch, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. The developers credited the game's tepid critical reception and associated stigma of intense difficulty for the game's slow sales. While Wohlwend hoped that a post-release patch would resolve <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> he did not expect the game to recoup its costs, though the team was proud of their product.|$|E

The conjecture does not prohibit faster-than-light travel. It just states that if a method to travel faster than light exists, and one tries to use it to build a time machine, something will go wrong: the energy accumulated will explode, or it will create a black hole." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{spinning}} reels do {{not suffer}} from backlash, line can occasionally be trapped underneath {{itself on the}} spool or even detach from the reel in loose loops of line. [...] <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> {{can be traced to}} overfilling the spool with line, while others are due {{to the way in which}} the line is wound onto the spool by the rotating bail or pickup. [...] Various oscillating spool mechanisms have been introduced over the years in an effort to solve this problem. [...] Spinning reels also tend to have more issues with twisting of the fishing line. [...] Line twist in spinning reels can occur from the spin of an attached lure, the action of the wire bail against the line when engaged by the crank handle, or even retrieval of line that is under load (spinning reel users normally pump the rod up and down, then retrieve the slack line to avoid line twist and stress on internal components). [...] In order to minimize line twist, many anglers who use a spinning reel manually reposition the bail after each cast with the pickup nearest the rod in order to minimize line twist.|$|E
