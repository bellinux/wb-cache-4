5000|$|When a draft {{promises}} immediate {{payment to}} the holder of the draft, {{it is called}} a <b>sight</b> <b>draft.</b> Cheques written on demand deposits are examples of sight drafts. When a draft promises a deferred payment to the holder of the draft, it is called a time draft. The date on which the payment is due is called the maturity date. In {{a case where the}} drawer and drawee of a time draft are distinct parties, the payee may submit the draft to the drawee for confirmation that the draft is a legitimate order and that the drawee will make payment on the specified date. Such confirmation is called an acceptance — the drawee accepts the order to pay as legitimate. The drawee stamps ACCEPTED on the draft and is thereafter obligated to make the specified payment when it is due. If the drawee is a bank, the acceptance is called a banker's acceptance. Bankers acceptances are considered eligible collateral under the Treasury Tax & Loan (TT&L) Program under 31 CFR part 203 ...|$|E

50|$|Demands drafts {{are also}} known as <b>sight</b> <b>drafts,</b> as they are payable when {{presented}} by sight to the bank. Under UCC 3-104, a draft {{has been defined as}} a negotiable instrument {{in the form of an}} order. The person making the order is known as the drawer and the person specified in the order is called the drawee, as defined in the UCC 3-103. The party who creates the draft is called the maker and party who is order to pay is called the drawee.|$|R
5000|$|The {{redemption}} {{movement is}} based on a theory developed in the 1980s by Roger Elvick, who has been called a [...] "founding father" [...] of the modern redemption movement. The theory is, in part, that for every citizen's birth certificate issued in the U.S. since the 1936 Social Security Act, the government deposits $630,000 in a hidden bank account linked to the newborn American and administered by a Jewish cabal. Redemptionists assert that by completing certain legal maneuvers and filing a series of government forms, the actual person may entitle himself or herself to the $630,000 held {{in the name of the}} doppelganger persona created for him or her at birth, and may then access these government funds using [...] "sight drafts". The government views these <b>sight</b> <b>drafts</b> as [...] "rubber checks" [...] and the entire scheme as fraudulent. The federal government has convicted the practitioners of fraud and conspiracy.|$|R
5000|$|On May 13, 1910, the Blish Milling Company {{shipped from}} Seymour, Indiana, to Bainbridge, Georgia, a carload of flour {{consigned}} {{to its own}} order, with direction to notify Draper-Garrett Grocery Company at Bainbridge. The bill of lading was issued by the Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Railroad Company. The shipper's <b>sight</b> <b>draft</b> upon the Draper- Garrett Grocery Company, for $1,109.89, covering {{the price of the}} flour, with a carrying charge, was attached to the bill of lading and forwarded to a bank in Bainbridge for collection. The flour was transferred to another car by the Central of Georgia Railway Company, a connecting carrier, and reached Bainbridge on June 2, 1910, over the line of the Georgia, Florida, & Alabama Railway Company, the plaintiff in error, in accordance with routing. The plaintiff in error, without requiring payment of the draft and surrender of the bill U.S. 190, 193 of lading (which were ultimately returned to the Blish Milling Company), delivered the car to the Draper-Garrett Grocery Company immediately on its arrival by placing it on the sidetrack of that company. In the course of unloading, the Grocery Company discovered that some of the flour was wet, and thereupon reloaded the part removed and returned the flour to the plaintiff in error. The subsequent course of events is thus stated by the court of appeals (id. pp. 144, 145): ...|$|E
40|$|The article {{explains}} {{the essence of}} the shadow economy as an objective phenomenon of socio-economic relations and its influence upon national economy security through instruments of pricing, fiscal restrictions, tax control, and banking and insurance regulation. It proves the necessity of use of the indirect method of assessment of the level of economy shadowing along with methods of direct control over the growth of shadowed economic relations, since such an approach would allow rational approach to identification of volumes and level of shadow activity. In the result of the study the article marks out varieties of indirect assessment of economy shadowing (methods of document, accounting and economic analysis), their specific features, advantages and shortcomings and results of practical use. The article reveals approaches and indicators of economic analysis that allow identification of reasons of deviations from the normal economic activity of economic subjects. It provides examples of the indirect method of assessment of the volume of shadowed economy that deal with analysis of demand on money and comparison of rates of the growth of the money supply with the volume of <b>sight</b> <b>drafts</b> with GDP...|$|R
2500|$|The chestburster was {{designed}} by Alien director Ridley Scott and constructed by special effects artist Roger Dicken. Giger had produced {{a model of a}} chestburster that resembled a [...] "degenerate plucked turkey" [...] and was far too large to fit inside a ribcage. Much to Giger's dismay, his model reduced the production team to fits of laughter on <b>sight.</b> Scott <b>drafted</b> a series of alternative designs for the chestburster based on the philosophy of working [...] "back [...] to the child" [...] and ultimately produced [...] "something phallic". The chestburster in the original Alien was armless, but arms were added in Aliens to facilitate the creature crawling its way out of its host's corpse. This concept would be abandoned in Alien: Resurrection, but return in Alien: Covenant.|$|R
40|$|After {{more than}} a century of {{constitutional}} reform debates, replacing the indefensible House of Lords with a decent elected Senate is now within <b>sight.</b> The government’s <b>draft</b> Bill is a vast improvement on previous Westminster-elite proposals. It needs only some achievable alterations to become a wholly desirable plan for reform. The key changes needed, Patrick Dunleavy writes, are fewer Senators, able to stand for two terms each, using a simple, open List system of proportional representation, and sitting in an all-elected House...|$|R

Ernst was initially enlisted as a collaborator on the report, but asked for his name to be removed after a <b>sight</b> of the <b>draft</b> report convinced him that Smallwood had [...] "written the conclusions before looking at the evidence". The report did not address whether CAM treatments were actually effective and Ernst described it as [...] "complete misleading rubbish".|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR PEOPLE,--A week in Paris reduced {{me to the}} {{limpness}} {{and lack}} of appetite peculiar to a kid glove, and gave Fanny a jumping sore throat. It's my belief there is death in the kettle there; a pestilence or the like. We came out here, pitched on the Star and Garter (they call it Somebody's pavilion), found the place a bed of lilacs and nightingales (first time I ever heard one), and also of a bird called the piasseur, cheerfulest of sylvan creatures, an ideal comic opera in itself. [...] "Come along, what fun, here's Pan in the next glade at picnic, and this-yer's Arcadia, and it's awful fun, and I've had a glass, I will not deny, but not to see it on me," [...] that is his meaning as near as I can gather. Well, the place (forest of beeches all new-fledged, grass like velvet, fleets of hyacinth) pleased us and did us good. We tried all ways to find a cheaper place, but could find nothing safe; cold, damp, brick-floored rooms and sich; we could not leave Paris till your seven days' <b>sight</b> on <b>draft</b> expired; we dared {{not go back to}} be miasmatised in these homes of putridity; so here we are till Tuesday in the Star and Garter. My throat is quite cured, appetite and strength on the mend. Fanny seems also picking up.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLast {{few decades}} have {{witnessed}} a rapid development in robotic technology. Different types of intelligent machines which facilitate various tasks in industry environment are becoming popular. This paper focuses on designing a low cost coconut tree climbing and harvesting robot. The kinematics and {{the motion of}} the robot are designed by referring to the motion of coconut harvester. The robot consists of two segments joined by a pair of threaded rods coupled to motors. The mechanical frame is designed in <b>draft</b> <b>sight</b> software and is implemented using aluminum segments and threaded rods. It has two arms driven by motors for holding. Locomotion of the robot is achieved using six motors out of which four motors are used in two hands and other two are used for upward and downward motion. The other part is a robotic arm for cutting down the coconuts. The robotic arm is attached on top of the climbing part. The operation of the cutting arm is done manually from the ground using a remote. The robot is automated using Arduino-Uno, motor H-bridge drivers, current and level sensors and other supporting circuits. The forward and the reverse motion of the motors are controlled by the Arduino through driver modules. Robot has automatic and manual functions fully controlled by the end-user. This paper has taken into account of the safety, reliability and the ease of use. A locomotion algorithm is developed to provide the robot with an autonomous capability for climbing. The prototype of the robot is implemented and tested successfully...|$|R
