The work reported herein deals primarily with the vapor diffusion-heat rejection (VD-HR) {{as it applies to}} the Space Shuttle. A stack configuration was selected, designed and fabricated. An asymmetric cellulose acetate membrane, used in reverse osmosis application was selected and a special spacer was designed to enhance mixing and promote mass transfer. A <b>skid-mount</b> unit was assembled from components used in the bench unit although no attempt was made to render it flight-suitable. The operating conditions of the VD-HR were examined and defined and a 60 -day continuous test was carried out.

The railroad's traffic computer required 4 digits, {{and so it}} emerged from the shop bearing a small SPMW 1166 stencil. In June 1969 it was renumbered to SP 8799, in standard Southern Pacific locomotive lettering configuration. The most drastic change in appearance was the locomotive's short hood (or [...] "nose"), which had been removed. In its place, a custom structure was fabricated to house twin Mitchell 35-millimeter film cameras and Nagra III timecode magnetic recording equipment, with stand-up headroom and two seats salvaged from another KM for operators. Heavy, thick steel was used for collision protection and to replace lost weight. The front Voith L830rU transmission was removed to create space for the camera enclosure, while the Number 1 radiator compartment was emptied of radiators and ancillary equipment to house an Onan <b>skid-mount</b> generator to power the camera equipment. The two engines and rear transmission were simply disabled, principally being retained for weight. All gearboxes and Cardan (universal) shafts were removed; gears were left in place on the six axles. All of the controls remained in the cab {{so that it could}} control a locomotive pushing behind it, much like a cab car is used on a commuter train. The camera car could be put on the lead of any train, but it primarily operated as special trips with just one locomotive behind it for power. Known locomotives used for power are a single EMD F7 B-unit, an EMD GP-9, an EMD GP35, and a Cotton Belt (St. Louis Southwestern) SD45T-2.|$|R

5000|$|The Raven used Hiller's [...] "Rotor-Matic" [...] {{cyclic control}} system, with two small servo rotor paddles offset 90 {{degrees to the}} main rotor blades. The paddles were {{attached}} to the control column, so that movement of the column would cause the pitch of the servo paddles to change, loading the main rotor blade so that the desired cyclic changes to the rotor occurred. [...] The OH-23 had {{a top speed of}} 97 mph (84 knots). The Raven had a two-bladed main rotor, a metal two-bladed tail rotor. Both the OH-23B and the OH-23C were powered by one Franklin O-335-5D engine.The OH-23D was a purely military version with a 0-435-23C engine and a more reliable transmission. Most OH-23Ds were replaced by the OH-23G, the most common version of the Raven, with a more powerful Lycoming O-540-9A six-cylinder, horizontally opposed, air-cooled 305 hp engine. The OH-23G could seat three. The MEDEVAC version carried two external <b>skid-mounted</b> litters or pods. The Raven saw service as a scout during {{the early part of the}} Vietnam War before being replaced by the OH-6A Cayuse in early 1968. A Raven piloted by Hugh Thompson, Jr. played a crucial role in curtailing the My Lai Massacre. The Raven could be armed with twin M37C [...]30-caliber machine guns on the XM1 armament subsystem or twin M60C 7.62 mm machine guns on the M2 armament subsystem. The XM76 sighting system was used for sighting the guns.|$|E

It was used for general light work, including observation, liaison, training, and search and rescue. When fitted as a light attack helicopter, it carried either two, <b>skid-mounted,</b> forward-firing machine gun (L8A1 GPMG) packs or a single pintle-mounted machine gun in the rear cabin. The pintle mount was available in both port and starboard mountings. The gun-packs, which were both aimed at a pre-set convergence angle, carried 200 rounds of ammunition and were mounted on a tubular spar that was fixed between {{the front and rear}} undercarriage legs. In the anti-tank role, it could carry four guided missiles (the Nord SS.11). The sighting unit was the AF.120, the result of a joint venture between Avimo and Ferranti, had x2.5 and x10 magnification. The APX Bezu sight unit was also evaluated but rejected, although it was adopted for use on the Westland Wasp. Additional testing and trials were carried out with the Swingfire anti-tank guided missile. Initial firings were carried out in early 1972, to test the [...] "Hawkswing" [...] system for the Westland Lynx, the associated AF.530 gyro-stabilized sight was subsequently trialled in 1974. The Hawkswing system was cancelled in 1975 due to its manual control system (MCLOS) compared to the semi-automatic (SACLOS) system utilised by Milan. In the casualty evacuation role (CASEVAC), the Scout could carry two stretchers internally or two on externally mounted pods, the co-pilots seat could also be reversed to allow an attendant to face the casualties.|$|E

40|$|Approximately 100 million gal {{of liquid}} waste {{is stored in}} {{underground}} storage tanks (UST) s at the Hanford Site, Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), Savannah River Site (SRS), and Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR). This waste is radioactive with a high salt content. The US Department of Energy (DOE) wants to minimize the volume of radioactive liquid waste in USTs by removing the excess water. This procedure conserves tank space; lowers the cost of storage; and reduces the volume of wastes subsequently requiring separation, immobilization, and disposal. The Out-of-Tank Evaporator Demonstration (OTED) was initiated to test a modular, <b>skid-mounted</b> evaporator. A mobile evaporator system manufactured by Delta Thermal Inc. was selected. The evaporator design was routinely used in commercial applications such as concentrating metal-plating wastes for recycle and concentrating ethylene glycol solutions. In FY 1995, the <b>skid-mounted</b> evaporator system was procured and installed in an existing ORNL facility (Building 7877) with temporary shielding and remote controls. The evaporator system was operational in January 1996. The system operated 24 h/day and processed 22, 000 gal of Melton Valley Storage Tank (MVST) supernatant. The distillate contained essentially no salts or radionuclides. Upon completion of the demonstration, the evaporator underwent decontamination testing to illustrate the feasibility of hands-on maintenance and potential transport to another DOE facility.

This waste is similar to wastes stored at Hanford and Savannah River. A single-stage subatmospheric evaporator rated to produce 90 gallons of distillate per hour was procured from Delta Thermal, Inc., of Pensacola, Florida, and installed in an existing building. During the 8 -day demonstration, 22, 000 gal of LLLW was concentrated by 25 % with the evaporator system. Decontamination factors achieved averaged 5 x 10 {sup 6 } (i. e., the distillate contained five million times less Cesium 137 than the feed). Evaporator performance substantially exceeded design requirements and expectations based on bench-scale surrogate test data. Out-of tank evaporator demonstration operations successfully addressed the feasibility of hands-on maintenance. Demonstration activities indicate that: (1) <b>skid-mounted,</b> mobile equipment is a viable alternative {{for the treatment of}} ORNL LLLW, and (2) hands-on maintenance and decontamination for movement to another site is achievable. Cost analysis show that 10 % of the demonstration costs will be immediately recovered by elimination of solidification and disposal costs. The entire cost of the demonstration can be recovered by processing the inventory of Melton Valley Storage Tank waste and/or sluice water prior to solidifications. An additional savings of approximately $ 200, 000 per year can be obtained by processing newly generated waste through the system.

Groundwater from that depth is highly acidic (pH 3. 2), and has high levels of nitrate, aluminum, uranium, and other heavy metals, as well as volatile chlorinated solvents (VOCs). Accordingly, an aboveground treatment train has been designed to remove these contaminants. The train consists of a vacuum stripper to remove VOCs, two chemical precipitation steps to adjust pH and remove metals, and a fluidized bed bioreactor to remove nitrate. The aboveground system will be coupled to a belowground recirculation system. The belowground system will contain an outer recirculation cell and a nested inner recirculation cell: the outer cells will be continuously flushed with nitrate-free treated groundwater. The inner cell will receive periodic inputs of uranium, tracer, and electron donor. Removal of uranium will be determined by comparing loss rates of conservative tracer and uranium within the inner recirculation cell.

40|$|Designs for {{advanced}} integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power systems call for desulfurization of carbonaceous fuel-derived synthesis gas (syngas) using regenerable sorbents at high-temperature, high pressure (HTHP) conditions. Regeneration of the sulfided sorbent using an oxygen-containing gas stream or air {{results in a}} sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }) -containing offgas at HTHP conditions. The patented Direct Sulfur Recovery Process (DSRP) developed by RTI {{with support from the}} National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and its precursor organizations [Federal Energy Technology Center (FETC) and Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC) ] efficiently converts the SO{sub 2 } in this offgas to elemental sulfur. Under development since 1988, the original work was conducted in a laboratory with simulated laboratory gas mixtures. The Direct Sulfur Recovery Process is a catalytic reduction process for efficiently converting to elemental sulfur up to 98 % or more of the sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }) contained in the regeneration offgas streams produced in advanced integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power systems. The DSRP reacts the regeneration offgas with a small slipstream of syngas to effect the desired reduction. In this project, the DSRP was demonstrated with actual coal-derived syngas (as opposed to the simulated laboratory mixtures used in previous projects for the original development work) in 75 -mm (3 -in) and 125 -mm (5 -in) fixed- and fluid-bed reactors. This report focuses primarily on the slipstream testing of a <b>skid-mounted</b> DSRP field-test unit that utilized the 125 mm (5 -in) fluid-bed reactor. This slipstream testing was conducted at the US Department of Energy's (DOE's) Power System Development Facility (PSDF) in Wilsonville, Alabama in conjunction with their coal gasification tests.

The DSRP reacts the regeneration offgas with a small slipstream of coal gas to effect the desired reduction. In this project the DSRP was demonstrated with actual coal gas (as opposed to the simulated laboratory mixtures used in previous studies) in a 75 -mm, 1 -L size fixed-bed reactor. Integrated with this testing, a US Department of Energy/Research Triangle Institute (DOE/RTI) patented zinc titanate-based fluidizable sorbent formulation was tested in a 75 -mm (3 -in.) diameter fluidized-bed reactor, and the regeneration offgas from that test was treated with the bench-unit DSRP. The testing was conducted at the DOE Federal Energy Technology Center (FETC) -Morgantown in conjunction with test campaigns of the pilot-scale gasifier there. The test apparatus was housed in a mobile laboratory built in a specially equipped office trailer that facilitated moving the equipment from RTI in North Carolina to the West Virginia test site. A long duration test of the DSRP using actual coal gas and simulated regeneration offgas showed no degradation in efficiency of conversion to elemental sulfur after 160 h of catalyst exposure. An additional exposure (200 h) of that same catalyst charge at the General Electric pilot gasifier showed only a small decline in performance. That problem is believed to have been caused by tar and soot deposits on the catalyst, which were caused by the high tar content of the atypical fixed-bed gasifier gas.

40|$|This {{fourth quarter}} report of 2002 {{describes}} progress {{on a project}} funded by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) to test a hybrid sulfur recovery process for natural gas upgrading. The process concept represents a low cost option for direct treatment of natural gas streams to remove H{sub 2 }S in quantities equivalent to 0. 2 - 25 metric tons (LT) of sulfur per day. This process is projected to have lower capital and operating costs than the competing technologies, amine/aqueous iron liquid redox and amine/Claus/tail gas treating, and have a smaller plant footprint, making it well suited to both on-shore and offshore applications. CrystaSulf (service mark of CrystaTech, Inc.) is a new nonaqueous sulfur recovery process that removes hydrogen sulfide (H{sub 2 }S) from gas streams and converts it into elemental sulfur. CrystaSulf features high sulfur recovery similar to aqueous-iron liquid redox sulfur recovery processes, but differs from the aqueous processes in that CrystaSulf controls the location where elemental sulfur particles are formed. In the hybrid process, approximately 1 / 3 of the total H{sub 2 }S in the natural gas is first oxidized to SO{sub 2 } at low temperatures over a heterogeneous catalyst. Low temperature oxidation is done so that the H{sub 2 }S can be oxidized {{in the presence of}} methane and other hydrocarbons without oxidation of the hydrocarbons. The project involves the development of a catalyst using laboratory/bench-scale catalyst testing, and then demonstration of the catalyst at CrystaTech's pilot plant in west Texas. Previous reports described development of a catalyst with the required selectivity and efficiency for producing sulfur dioxide from H{sub 2 }S. In the laboratory, the catalyst was shown to be robust and stable in the presence of several intentionally added contaminants, including condensate from the pilot plant site.

40|$|The Phase I {{study of}} the {{geothermal}} potential of Ascension Island concluded {{that the possibility of}} a geothermal resource existing under the island was excellent. This conclusion was based on the presence of young volcanic rocks (a heat source close to the surface), an ample supply of water from the sea, and high permeability of many of the rocks which make up the island. The assumption was made that the resource would be similar to geothermal systems in the Azores or Japan, and a conceptual design of a power plant to utilize the resource was prepared upon which cost estimates and an economic analysis were subsequently performed. The results of the economic analysis were very favorable, and the Air Force decided to proceed into Phase II of the project. Under Phase II, an exploration program was designed and carried out. The purpose of the program was to ascertain whether or not a geothermal resource existed beneath Ascension island and, to the extent possible, to evaluate the quality of that resource. The exploration involved a detailed aeromagnetic survey of the island, reconnaissance and detailed electrical resistivity surveys, and drilling of holes for the measurement of temperatures. These methods have confirmed the existence of geothermal activity beneath Ascension. Measured temperature gradients and bottom hole temperatures as well as chemical geothermometers indicate temperatures sufficient for the generation of electricity within reasonable drilling depths. This report documents those conclusions and the supporting data. This report also documents the results of the power plant update with new data supplied from the Phase II exploration activities on the island. The power plant scenario has been changed to reflect the fact that the resource temperature may not be as high as that originally assumed in the Phase I study, the location of the production wells will in all likelihood be farther from the existing Air Force facilities [...] either north of Grazing Valley or south of Traveller's Hill [...] and the demand for power has increased which results in a more efficient utilization of the geothermal resource. The power plant concept chosen is similar to that used for Phase I in that small, modular, <b>skid-mounted,</b> factory assembled and tested, units are used to supply the power and potable water...|$|E
40|$|The Texas Hydrogen Highway {{project has}} showcased a {{hydrogen}} fuel cell transit bus and hydrogen fueling infrastructure that was designed and built through previous support from various public and private sector entities. The aim of this project has been to increase awareness among transit agencies and other public entities on these transportation technologies, and to place such technologies into commercial applications, such as a public transit agency. The initial project concept developed in 2004 was {{to show that a}} <b>skid-mounted,</b> fully-integrated, factory-built and tested hydrogen fueling station could be used to simplify the design, and lower the cost of fueling infrastructure for fuel cell vehicles. The approach was to design, engineer, build, and test the integrated fueling station at the factory then install it at a site that offered educational and technical resources and provide an opportunity to showcase both the fueling station and advanced hydrogen vehicles. The two primary technology components include: Hydrogen Fueling Station: The hydrogen fueling infrastructure was designed and built by Gas Technology Institute primarily through a funding grant from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. It includes hydrogen production, clean-up, compression, storage, and dispensing. The station consists of a steam methane reformer, gas clean-up system, gas compressor and 48 kilograms of hydrogen storage capacity for dispensing at 5000 psig. The station is <b>skid-mounted</b> for easy installation and can be relocated if needed. It includes a dispenser that is designed to provide temperaturecompensated fills using a control algorithm. The total station daily capacity is approximately 50 kilograms. Fuel Cell Bus: The transit passenger bus built by Ebus, a company located in Downey, CA, was commissioned and acquired by GTI prior to this project. It is a fuel cell plug-in hybrid electric vehicle which is ADA compliant, has air conditioning sufficient for Texas operations, and regenerative braking for battery charging. It uses a 19. 3 kW Ballard PEM fuel cell, will store 12. 6 kg of hydrogen at 350 Bar, and includes a 60 kWh battery storage system. The objectives of the project included the following: (a) To advance commercialization of hydrogen-powered transit buses and supporting infrastructure; (b) To provide public outreach and education by showcasing the operation of a 22 -foot fuel cell hybrid shuttle bus and Texas first hydrogen fueling infrastructure; and (c) To showcase operation of zero-emissions vehicle for potential transit applications. As mentioned above, the project successfully demonstrated an early vehicle technology, the Ebus plug-in hybrid fuel cell bus, and that success has led to the acquisition of a more advanced vehicle that {{can take advantage of the}} same fueling infrastructure. Needed hydrogen station improvements have been identified that will enhance the capabilities of the fueling infrastructure to serve the new bus and to meet the transit agency needs. Over the course of this project, public officials, local government staff, and transit operators were engaged in outreach and education activities that acquainted them with the real world operation of a fuel cell bus and fueling infrastructure. Transit staff members in the Dallas/Ft. Worth region were invited to a workshop in Arlington, Texas at the North Central Texas Council of Governments to participate in a workshop on hydrogen and fuel cells, and to see the fuel cell bus in operation. The bus was trucked to the meeting for this purpose so that participants could see and ride the bus. Austin area transit staff members visited the fueling site in Austin to be briefed on the bus and to participate in a fueling demonstration. This led to further meetings to determine how a fuel cell bus and fueling station could be deployed at Capital Metro Transit. Target urban regions that expressed additional interest during the project in response to the outreach meetings and showcase events include San Antonio and Austin, Texas. In summary, the project objectives were achieved in the following ways: Through presentations and papers provided to a variety of audiences in multiple venues, the project team fulfilled its goal of providing education and outreach on hydrogen technology to statewide audiences. The project team generated interest that exists well beyond the completion of the project, and indeed, helped to generate financial support for a subsequent hydrogen vehicle project in Austin. The University of Texas, Center for ElectroMechanics operated the fuel cell-electric Ebus vehicle for over 13, 000 miles in Austin, Texas in a variety of routes and loading configurations. The project took advantage of prior efforts that created a hydrogen fueling station and fuel cell electric-hybrid bus and continued to verify their technical foundation, while informing and educating potential future users of how these technologies work...|$|E
40|$|Sorbent Technologies Corporation (Sorbtech) of Twinsburg, Ohio has {{developed}} a new technology for converting SO{sub 2 }-rich gas streams directly to elemental sulfur. Key to the technology is a special catalyst that promotes the reaction of SO{sub 2 } with reformed natural gas. The technology evolved from earlier flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) work that Sorbtech engineers performed in the late 1980 's. In 1995, with U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) support, Sorbtech designed and constructed a larger, <b>skid-mounted</b> pilot-test unit suitable for demonstrating the new technology in field tests. This Report summarizes months of preparation work and eight days of testing that were performed at FETC'S facilities during late September and early October, 1997. On {{the basis of the}} results of this phase of the project, the following conclusions were made: (1) The chemistry of the new technology was well proven and demonstrated at FETC. The overall S 0 {sub 2 }-to-elemental sulfur yields were typically in the range of 93 to 98 percent. (The project goal was 95 percent, so the goal was exceeded). (2) Sulfur selectivity values, indicating the tendency of S 0 {sub 2 } to be converted to elemental sulfur in preference to H{sub 2 }S or COS, were typically in the range of 98 to 100 percent. (3) Bright yellow sulfur of high quality was produced at FETC. (4) The FETC regenerator exhaust gas presented no processing difficulties. Swings in the level of methane in the exhaust gas were handled with relative ease. (5) With the exception of the water condenser, all system components performed well. (6) Condensing of the sulfur after its production was a serious problem at FETC. Solid sulfur deposits built up in the process-gas lines at several locations in the system. Clogging of the lines necessitated terminating runs typically after 2 to 4 hours of operation. Clogging problems were most severe in the water condenser. Many planned parametric tests were not run because of the sulfur plugging problems. (7) Several suggestions were made by BP Oil Company for solving the sulfur pl ugging problems. Among the suggestions were to never allow the temperature of the process gas to fall below 118 {degree}C, to increase the temperature of the sulfur condenser to 148 {degree}C, and to eliminate the water condenser from the system entirely...|$|E
40|$|In situ vacuum extraction, air or steam sparging, and {{vitrification}} {{are widely}} used to remediate soil contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). All of these processes produce a VOC-laden air stream from which the VOC must be removed before the air can be discharged or recycled to the generating process. Treatment of these off-gases is often {{a major portion of}} the cost of the remediation project. Currently, carbon adsorption and catalytic incineration are the most common methods of treating these gas streams. Membrane Technology and Research, Inc. (MTR) proposed an alternative treatment technology based on selective membranes that separate the organic components from the gas stream, producing a VOC-free air stream. This technology can be applied to off-gases produced by various remediation activities and the systems can be <b>skid-mounted</b> and automated for easy transportation and unattended operation. The target performance for the membrane systems is to produce clean air (less than 10 ppmv VOC) for discharge or recycle, dischargeable water (less than 1 ppmw VOC), and a concentrated liquid VOC phase. This report contains the results obtained during Phase II of a two-phase project. In Phase I, laboratory experiments were carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. In the subsequent Phase II project, a demonstration system was built and operated at the McClellan Air Force Base near Sacramento, California. The membrane system was fed with off-gas from a Soil Vacuum Extraction (SVE) system. The work performed in Phase II demonstrated that the membrane system can reduce the VOC concentration in remediation off-gas to 10 ppmv, while producing a concentrated VOC phase and dischargeable water containing less than 1 ppmw VOC. However, the tests showed that the presence of 1 to 3 % carbon dioxide in the SVE off-gas reduced the treatment capacity of the system by a factor of three to four. In an economic analysis, treatment costs of the membrane system were compared with those of catalytic oxidation and carbon adsorption. This analysis showed that the treatment costs of the membrane system are higher than those of the competing technologies in the VOC concentration range up to 1 %. Catalytic oxidation is the most economical treatment technology for off-gases containing VOCs in the range 50 ppmv to 1 %, whereas carbon adsorption (off-site regeneration) is the most economical for VOC concentrations less than 50 ppmv. Because the VOC concentration in the vast majority of remediation off-gases is below 1 %, we conclude that the usefulness of membrane VOC-separation systems for remediation applications will be very limited...|$|E
40|$|Overall {{objective}} of this project {{was to develop a}} technology platform for cleaning/conditioning the syngas from an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) system at elevated temperatures (500 - 1, 000 F) and gasifier pressures to meet the tolerance limits for contaminants, including H{sub 2 }S, COS, NH{sub 3 }, HCl, Hg, and As. This technology development effort involved progressive development and testing of sorbent/catalytic materials and associated processes through laboratory, bench, pilot, and demonstration testing phases, coupled with a comprehensive systems analysis at various stages of development. The development of the regenerable RTI- 3 desulfurization sorbent - a highly attrition-resistant, supported ZnO-based material - was the key discovery in this project. RTI- 3 's high attrition resistance, coupled with its high reactivity, effectively allowed its application in a high-velocity transport reactor system. Production of the RTI- 3 sorbent was successfully scaled up to an 8, 000 -lb batch by Sued-Chemie. In October 2005, RTI obtained U. S Patent 6, 951, 635 to protect the RTI- 3 sorbent technology and won the 2004 R&D 100 Award for development of this material. The RTI- 3 sorbent formed the basis {{for the development of the}} High-Temperature Desulfurization System (HTDS), a dual-loop transport reactor system for removing the reduced sulfur species from syngas. An 83 -foot-tall, pilot HTDS unit was constructed and commissioned first at ChevronTexaco's gasification site and later at Eastman's gasification plant. At Eastman, the HTDS technology was successfully operated with coal-derived syngas for a total of 3, 017 hrs over a 12 -month period and consistently reduced the sulfur level to < 10 ppmv. The sorbent attrition rate averaged {approx} 31 lb/MM lb of circulation. To complement the HTDS technology, which extracts the sulfur from syngas as SO{sub 2 }, RTI developed the Direct Sulfur Recovery Process (DSRP). The DSRP, operating at high pressure and high temperature, uses a small slipstream of syngas to catalytically reduce the SO{sub 2 } produced in the warm syngas desulfurization process to elemental sulfur. To demonstrate this process at Eastman, RTI constructed and commissioned a <b>skid-mounted</b> pilot DSRP unit. During its 117 -h operation, the DSRP system achieved 90 % to 98 % removal of the inlet sulfur. The DSRP catalyst proved very robust, demonstrating consistent reaction rates in multiple experiments over a 3 -year period. Sorbent materials for removing trace NH{sub 3 }, Hg, and As impurities from syngas at high temperature and high pressure were developed and tested with real syngas. A Li{sub 4 }SiO{sub 4 } sorbent for removal of CO{sub 2 } from syngas at high temperature was also developed and tested. The Li{sub 4 }SiO{sub 4 } material demonstrates excellent CO{sub 2 } removal, but its regeneration was found to be technically challenging. Additionally, reverse-selective polymer membrane materials were investigated for the bulk removal of CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }S from syngas. These materials exhibited adequate separation at ambient conditions for these acid gases. Field testing of these membrane modules with real syngas demonstrated potential use for acid-gas separation from syngas. The HTDS/DSRP technologies are estimated to have a significant economic advantage over conventional gas cleanup technologies such as Selexol{trademark} and Rectisol. From a number of system studies, use of HTDS/DSRP is expected to give a 2 - 3 percentage point increase in the overall IGCC thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in capital cost. Thus, there is significant economic incentive for adaptation of these warm gas cleanup technologies due to significantly increased thermal efficiency and reduction in capital and operating costs. RTI and Eastman are currently in discussions with a number of companies to commercialize this technology...|$|E
