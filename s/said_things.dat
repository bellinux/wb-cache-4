25|$|On February 27, 2012, a poll by El Universal {{showed a}} 58% {{approval}} rating with only 11% disapproval, {{a decrease in}} concern for security from 48% to 33% polled listing security as the top concern facing the government, 42% say things have improved in Mexico since Felipe Calderón's administration, 21% <b>said</b> <b>things</b> have stayed the same, while 34% <b>said</b> <b>things</b> have gotten worse.|$|E

25|$|Although (like most Deleuzo-Guattarian terms) deterritorialization has a {{purposeful}} {{variance in}} meaning throughout their oeuvre, {{it can be}} roughly described as a move away from a rigidly imposed hierarchical, arborescent context, which seeks to package things (concepts, objects, etc.) into discrete categorised units with singular coded meanings or identities, towards a rhizomatic zone of multiplicity and fluctuant identity, where meanings and operations flow freely between <b>said</b> <b>things,</b> resulting in a dynamic, constantly changing set of interconnected entities with fuzzy individual boundaries.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "I don't/doesn't give a shit" [...] can be {{used when}} one does not care about something, or has a passive {{attitude}} toward <b>said</b> <b>thing,</b> as it denotes indifference. In context, one can say: [...] "You're offended? Well, I don't give a shit!" ...|$|R

25|$|Giuliani's {{opponent}} in 1997 was Democratic Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger, who had beaten Al Sharpton in the September 9, 1997 Democratic primary. In the general election, Giuliani once again had the Liberal Party {{and not the}} Conservative Party listing. Giuliani ran an aggressive campaign, parlaying his image as a tough leader who had cleaned up the city. Giuliani's popularity was at its highest point to date, with a late October 1997 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showing him as having a 68 percent approval rating; 70 percent of New Yorkers were satisfied with life {{in the city and}} 64 percent <b>said</b> <b>things</b> were better in the city compared to four years previously.|$|E
500|$|McCain was famously {{accessible}} to the press, using free media to compensate for his lack of funds. [...] As one reporter later recounted, [...] "McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus; he talked so much that sometimes he <b>said</b> <b>things</b> that he shouldn't have, and that's why the media loved him." [...] Some McCain aides saw the senator as naturally preferring the company of reporters to other politicians.|$|E
500|$|Josh Weinstein has {{expressed}} regret about killing off Grimes after only one episode, describing him as [...] "such an amazing character." [...] In {{an interview with}} The Believer, producer George Meyer said, [...] "Grimes's cardinal sin was that he shined a light on Springfield. He pointed out everything that was wrongheaded and idiotic about that world. And {{the people who do}} that tend to become martyrs. He <b>said</b> <b>things</b> that needed to be said, but once they were said, we needed to destroy that person. I'll admit, we took a certain sadistic glee in his downfall. He was such a righteous person, and that somehow made his demise more satisfying." ...|$|E

50|$|Semantic lexicons also {{distinguish}} between types, where {{a type of}} something has characteristics of a thing such as a Rhodesian Ridgeback being a type of dog, and instances, where something {{is an example of}} <b>said</b> <b>thing,</b> such as Dave Grohl is an instance of a musician. Instances are always terminal nodes because they are solitary and don’t have other words or ontological categories belonging to them.|$|R

500|$|Brown {{refused to}} serve on the inaugural {{committee}} of his old political foe, Steve Beshear, when Beshear was elected governor in 2007. All of Kentucky's living former Democratic governors were invited to participate, and each accepted the invitation with the exception of Brown. Of his refusal, Brown stated [...] "I don't respect him. I don't {{want to be part of}} it. I'm not really interested in being politically correct." [...] Referring to the 1987 Democratic gubernatorial primary campaign, Brown continued, [...] "He <b>said</b> <b>things</b> that were not true, like we had raised taxes. I just never respected him after that." [...] When Beshear was reelected in 2011, Brown served as inauguration co-chair with the other former governors.|$|E
500|$|... "Pink and Blue" [...] {{was written}} by Diamond and A.G. Cook. In an {{interview}} with Nylon, Diamond revealed she had met Cook during her [...] "first or second year" [...] at a university, and described becoming a musician as natural and random. Diamond also stated that the [...] "how about you" [...] lyric reminded her of how she would go on MSN after going to school growing up, and how the people on MSN <b>said</b> <b>things</b> such as [...] "'how are you' and 'wuu2.'". [...] "Pink and Blue" [...] was released on 30 October 2013 to label PC Music's SoundCloud, where it was available to be streamed and downloaded for free. On 8 May 2014, the song had reached 100,000 plays on SoundCloud, becoming the first song released on the PC Music label to do so.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{focused on}} the New Hampshire primary, where his message appealed to independents. He {{traveled}} on a campaign bus called the Straight Talk Express. He held many town hall meetings, answering every question voters asked, in a successful example of [...] "retail politics", and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds. One reporter later recounted that, [...] "McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus; he talked so much that sometimes he <b>said</b> <b>things</b> that he shouldn't have, and that's why the media loved him." [...] On February 1, 2000, he won New Hampshire's primary with 49percent of the vote to Bush's 30percent. The Bush campaign and the Republican establishment feared that a McCain victory in the crucial South Carolina primary might give his campaign unstoppable momentum.|$|E

500|$|Calle 13 {{once again}} became {{the subject of}} debate when the duo {{traveled}} to Cuba in March 2010, to perform in front of the American embassy in the country. Before the show, a political prisoner had died in a hunger strike in protest of the Cuban government, and Cuban exiles in Miami criticized the group for performing at such a time. Residente defended the performance, noting that it had been inaccurately reported and that [...] "we <b>said</b> <b>things</b> that no artist had said from the stage, like 'here the people are in charge, and the government has to obey.'" [...] These events had a major impact on Residente's lyrical style and the subjects he planned to discuss on the new album: [...] "What's making me more mature is not about my age, it's about what I'm seeing and living. I'm not saying things carelessly anymore. I'm thinking before I say them." ...|$|E
500|$|The ONA are {{strongly}} critical of larger Satanic {{groups like the}} Church of Satan and the Temple of Set, whom they deem to be [...] "sham-Satanic" [...] because they embrace the [...] "glamour associated with Satanism" [...] but are [...] "afraid to experience its realness within and external to them". In turn, the Church of Satan has criticised what they alleged was the Order's [...] "paranoic insistence {{that they are the}} only upholders of Satanic tradition", with Kaplan stating that these comments reflect [...] "the intramural tensions" [...] that are common within [...] "the world of Satanism", and about which criticism Anton Long wrote that the ONA does not [...] "claim to be a peer organization with a claim to some kind of authority... When in the past we and others like us have <b>said</b> <b>things</b> that others interpret as being against the [...] or La Vey, we were simply assuming the role of Adversary – challenging what seemed to be becoming accepted dogma." ...|$|E
500|$|Full {{production}} {{began on}} Chrono Cross in mid-1998. The Chrono Cross team reached 80 members at its peak, with additional personnel of 10–20 cut-scene artists and 100 quality assurance testers. The team felt pressure {{to live up}} to the work of Chrono Triggers [...] "Dream Team" [...] development group, which included famous Japanese manga artist Akira Toriyama. Kato and Tanaka hired Nobuteru Yūki for character design and Yasuyuki Honne for art direction and concept art. The event team originally envisioned a short game, and planned a system by which players would befriend any person in a town for alliance in battle. Developers brainstormed traits and archetypes during the character-creation process, originally planning 64 characters with unique endings that could vary in three different ways per character. Kato described the character creation process: [...] "Take Pierre, for example: we started off by saying we wanted a wacko fake hero like Tata from Trigger. We also <b>said</b> <b>things</b> like 'we need at least one powerful mom', 'no way we're gonna go without a twisted brat', and so on so forth." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Lita and Kane lasted until the May 16 episode of Raw, when Lita turned on Kane, by helping Edge defeat {{him in the}} finals of the Raw Gold Rush Tournament, while also revealing she had been faking her knee injury. This made Lita become a villain {{for the first and}} only time in her career. On the May 30 episode of Raw, Lita announced that she had filed for divorce, and <b>said</b> <b>things</b> such as Kane was like a 4th grader in the bedroom, that she would not have to deal with things such as his sweaty body, the [...] "stupid little" [...] laugh he does, and the wedding ring being flushed down a toilet. She then attempted to marry Edge on the June 20 episode of Raw, but the marriage ceremony was interrupted by a vengeful Kane, who emerged from beneath the ring, destroyed the ceremony, and as Edge and Lita escaped from the ring, Kane tombstoned their priest. The storyline with Kane ended shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men <b>said</b> <b>things</b> like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do {{we have to look at}} that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E
2500|$|In 1951, Passman {{spoke out}} against Dodd's gubernatorial {{candidacy}} and accused Dodd of having enriched himself while in office. Dodd said that Passman [...] "got hyped up during the campaign and <b>said</b> <b>things</b> he wouldn't even think about under normal circumstances." [...] As Passman's attacks continued, Dodd confronted him on the mezzanine of the Virginia Hotel in Monroe. There, Dodd claimed to have given Passman [...] "a good old-fashioned whipping." ...|$|E

2500|$|While denying [...] "sadism", Scotland <b>said</b> <b>things</b> {{were done}} that were [...] "mentally just as cruel". One [...] "cheeky and obstinate" [...] prisoner, he said, {{was forced to}} strip naked and exercise. This [...] "deflated him completely" [...] {{and he began to}} talk. Prisoners were {{sometimes}} forced to stand [...] "round the clock", and [...] "if a prisoner wanted to pee he had to do it there and then, in his clothes. It was surprisingly effective." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{his songs}} have spiritual allusions, but Stevens does not {{identify}} as a contemporary Christian music artist or frequently discuss religion with the press. He told The Village Voice, [...] "I don't think music media is the real forum for theological discussions. I think I've <b>said</b> <b>things</b> and sung about things that probably weren't appropriate {{for this kind of}} form. And I just feel like it's not my work or my place to be making claims and statements, because I often think it's misunderstood." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{sales pitch}} {{was typical of}} Wolfman Jack's growling, exuberant on-air style.

[...] Part of the persona was his nocturnal anonymity; listeners from coast to coast {{had no idea how to}} recognize the face behind the voice that <b>said</b> <b>things</b> like [...] "Wolfman plays the best records in the business, and then he eats 'em!" ...|$|E
