40|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{showed that}} {{the two types of}} protein bodies (PB) in <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperms</b> of rice were formed differently during the period of storage protein accu-mulation. Two routes for the transport of storage protein from the site of synthesis at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) to the site of accumulation were also proposed. PB-I, bound by a single membrane to which ribosomes were attached, was thought to develop inside the cisternae of RER, while the PB-I I membrane was thought to originate from the vacuole. In the wheat germ cell-free translation system, storage protein-related polypeptides of developing rice endosperms, including a precursor of glutelin and putative precursors of prolamin, were directed by membrane-bound polysomes but not by free-polysomes. Immunoassay of the total translation products directed by a PB fraction showed that 46 % were storage protein-related polypeptides. Rice storage proteins (prolamin) that accumulate in PB-I appear to be synthesized by membrane-bound polysomes attached to PB-I or RER and to pass through the membrane into the lumen where they aggregate and are deposited. The proteins (glutelin and globulin) that accumulate in PB-II, however, seem to be synthesized by membrane-bound polysomes as a large precursor and to become sequestered into the cisternal space of RER, from where they are transferred to the vacuolar precursor of PB-II.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The amylose {{component}} of cereal starch contains lysophospholipid, predominantly lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) as inclusion complexes. As starch undergoes degradation by amylases during barley germination, lysophospholipase (LPL) an enzyme which degrades lysophospholipids {{appears in the}} <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperms</b> and becomes associated with the starch fraction. The enzyme {{has been reported to}} have a pH optimum at 8 with an inflection near 5. A study with two varieties of Glacier barley, one with a high amylose content, was conducted to assess the influence of starch com position on its mobilization and on other factors during germination. It was found that there is essentially no difference between the two varieties in the rate at which either total starch or amylose is degraded during germination. Included lipid also has no influence on the rate of amylose degradation. Both LPL activities (pH 8 and 5) increase markedly at day 5 of germination. The proportion of the alkaline activity associated with the starch is greater than for the acidic activity. However, there is no correlation between amylose content or amylose included lipid and starch-bound LPL activity. LPL activity has been purified and characterized from a 4 day, unkilned brewing barley variety Advance. It displays the properties of a basic, lipophilic glycoprotein with a pH optimum at 8. The most active glycoprotein (LPL I) has Km 30 μM, Vmax 200 μmol/min/mg protein against LPC- 1 -palmitoyl as substrate. It has molecular weight 41, 000; pI 8. 8 and contains 12...|$|R
40|$|Transformation {{allows the}} {{production}} of wheat plants with specific differences in their gluten structure, {{by the introduction of}} additional genes for wild type or mutant proteins. Similarly, genes from other species can also be inserted, such as those for the gamma -zein proteins which are associated with hard endosperm texture in maize. It therefore allows the relationships between protein composition and grain functionality to be established. Transgenic wheat lines were obtained by transformation with genes encoding wild type subunit 1 Dx 5, long and short mutant forms of this subunit and subunit Dx 2. 2 *, using particle bombardment. The mutant HMW subunit constructs differ in the lengths of their repetitive domain while subunit 1 Dx 2. 2 * is the largest HMW glutenin subunit reported. These genes will therefore provide information on the relationship between subunit structure and gluten properties. Expression of the wild type and mutant forms of subunit 1 Dx 5 has been shown by SDS-PAGE of seed proteins. Small-scale Mixograph analysis and other testing of flour from these lines will be carried out to determine changes in functional properties. In a related study, transgenic wheat plants with the gamma -zein gene driven by either the wheat HMW subunit promoter or the maize gamma -zein promoter were produced. Analysis of the seed proteins of several gamma -zein PCR-positive lines, by dot blotting and antibody hybridisation and SDS-PAGE, has shown the expression of the gamma -zein gene. To study the tissue specificity, several homozygous transgenic plants were produced with the uidA gene driven by the HMW subunit promoter.

5000|$|The {{aleurone}} layer surrounds the endosperm tissue of grass seeds and is morphologically and biochemically distinct from it. <b>Starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> cells are large, irregularly shaped cells and contain starch grains while aleurone cells are cuboidal {{in shape and}} contain aleurone grains. In most cultivated cereals (wheat species, rye, oats, rice and maize) the aleurone is single-layered, whereas barley has a multicellular {{aleurone layer}}. Thick primary cell walls enclose and protect the aleurone cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{aleurone}} layer performs {{a variety of}} functions to help maintain proper development of the seed. One {{example of this is}} maintaining a low pH in the apoplast. In cereals, the {{aleurone layer}} releases organic and phosphoric acids {{in order to keep the}} pH of the endosperm between a pH of 3.5 and 4. In barley, the aleurone layer also releases nitrite into the <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> and apoplast under anaerobic conditions. In addition, although the function is unclear, a certain class of hemoglobins (Hb)is present in the outer layer of living cells including the aleurone tissue in barley and rice seeds.|$|E
50|$|Mutants of the dek1 gene {{block the}} {{formation}} of aleurone and cause the cells to develop as <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> cells instead of aleurone cells. This causes the seed to lack an aleurone layer. This mutation {{is caused by the}} insertion of a Mu transposon into the dek1 gene, causing it to function incorrectly. However, this transposon may sometimes remove itself from the gene, restoring the function of dek1. Experiments in this area have helped demonstrate that the cues that determine aleurone positioning are still present in the later stages of development, and the aleurone cells still respond to these cues.|$|E
50|$|During seed germination, {{the plant}} embryo {{produces}} the hormone gibberellin which triggers the aleurone cells to release α-amylase for the hydrolysis of starch, proteases, and storage proteins into the endosperm. Evidence that G-proteins {{play a role}} in the gibberellin signaling events has been obtained. The breakdown of the <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> supplies sugars to drive the growth of roots and the acrospire. This release of amylase is considered to be the most important and sole function of the aleurone layer. This effect is inhibited by the plant hormone abscisic acid, which keeps the seed dormant. After completing this function, the aleurone cells in the developing seed undergo apoptosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{aleurone}} layer {{is important for}} both the developing seed and the mature plant. The aleurone tissue accumulates large quantities of oils and lipids that are useful during seed development. It is also a site of mineral storage and in some species, functions in seed dormancy. The aleurone may also express several pathogen-protective proteins including PR-4. Aleurone also serves as the most dietarily beneficial fraction in many brans. In addition, the aleurone tissue contains many protein-storing vacuoles known as protein bodies. In cereals with <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm,</b> the aleurone contains about 30% of the kernel's proteins. In multicolored corn, anthocyanin pigments in the {{aleurone layer}} give the kernels a dark, bluish-black color.|$|E

Protein bodies were isolated from each tissue by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Ultrastructure of the isolated protein bodies was not identical to that of the intact organelles, suggesting modification during isolation or fixation. Both aleurone and <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> protein bodies contained globulin and prolamin storage protein, but minor differences in the protein-banding pattern by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were evident.

40|$|Maize (Zea mays) {{endosperm}} {{consists of}} an epidermal-like surface layer of aleurone cells, an underlying body of <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> cells, and a basal layer of transfer cells. To determine whether surrounding maternal tissues perform a role in specifying endosperm cell fates, a maize endosperm organ culture technique was established whereby the developing endosperm is completely removed from surrounding maternal tissues. Using cell type-specific fluorescence markers, we show that aleurone cell fate specification occurs exclusively in response to surface position and does not require specific, continued maternal signal input. The <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> and aleurone cell fates are freely interchangeable throughout the lifespan of the endosperm, with internalized aleurone cells converting to <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> cells and with <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> cells that become positioned at the surface converting to aleurone cells. In contrast to aleurone and <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> cells, transfer cells fail to develop in in vitro-grown endosperm, supporting earlier indications that maternal tissue interaction is required to fully differentiate this cell type.

40|$|Zeins, the prolamin storage {{proteins}} {{found in}} maize (Zea mays), accumulate in accretions called protein bodies inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> cells.

Unlike the <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm,</b> aleurone cells accumulate these storage proteins inside protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) instead of the ER. Aleurone PSVs contain zeinrich protein inclusions, a matrix, and a large system of intravacuolar membranes. After being assembled in the ER, zeins are delivered to the aleurone PSVs in atypical prevacuolar compartments that seem to arise at least partially by autophagy and consist of multilayered membranes and engulfed cytoplasmic material. The zein-containing prevacuolar compartments are neither surrounded by a double membrane nor decorated by AUTOPHAGY RELATED 8 protein, suggesting that they are not typical autophagosomes. The PSV matrix contains glycoproteins that are trafficked through a Golgi-multivesicular body (MVB) pathway. MVBs likely fuse with the multilayered, autophagic compartments before merging with the PSV. The presence of similar PSVs also containing prolamins and large systems of intravacuolar membranes in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> suggests that this trafficking mechanism may be common among cereals...|$|E

Genes important for carbohydrate metabolism in developing endosperm were analyzed using qRT-PCR, {{and some of the}} genes showed specific localization in either tissue of the endosperm. Aleurone layer-specific gene expression of a sucrose transporter, OsSUT 1, suggested that the gene functions in sucrose uptake into aleurone cells. The expression levels of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPL 2 and AGPS 2 b) in each endosperm tissue spatially corresponded to the distribution of starch granules differentially observed among endosperm tissues. By contrast, expressions of genes for sucrose cleavage—hexokinase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and phosphoglucomutase—were observed in all endosperm tissues tested. Aleurone cells predominantly expressed mRNAs for the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. This finding was supported by the presence of oxygen (8  % concentration) and large numbers of mitochondria in the aleurone layers.

De-embryonated half grains show the capacity for GA 3 -activated medium acidification when incubation is carried out at pH 6. 0 to 7. 0 but not at lower pHs. In addition, the activating effect of GA 3 on the expression of carboxypeptidase III and thiol protease genes is more efficient when the hormone treatment is carried out at neutral pH. In situ pH staining showed that <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> acidification takes place upon imbibition and advances from the embryo to the distal part of the grain. In situ hybridization experiments showed a similar pattern of expression of a carboxypeptidase III gene, which is up-regulated by GA 3 in aleurone cells. However, aleurone gene expression precedes <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> acidification.

Welldefined elemental distribution occurred with Mn. Manganese was found only in globoid crystals located in the base and midregions of the stele in the radicle.

A complete inventory of transcripts of 124 glycosyltransferase (GT) and 72 glycosylhydrolase (GH) genes associated with cell walls is presented. The most highly expressed GT transcript (excluding those known to be involved in starch synthesis) was a GT 47 family transcript similar to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) IRX 10 involved in xylan extension, and the second most abundant was a GT 61. Profiles for GT 43 IRX 9 and IRX 14 putative orthologs were consistent with roles in AX synthesis. Low abundances were found for transcripts from genes in the acyl-coA transferase BAHD family, for which a role in AX feruloylation has been postulated. The relative expression of these was much greater in whole grain compared with <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm,</b> correlating with the levels of bound ferulate. Transcripts associated with callose (GSL), cellulose (CESA), pectin (GAUT), and glucomannan (CSLA) synthesis were also abundant in <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm,</b> while the corresponding cell wall polysaccharides were confirmed as low abundance (glucomannan and callose) or undetectable (pectin) in these samples. Abundant transcripts from GH families associated with the hydrolysis of these polysaccharides were also present, suggesting that they may be rapidly turned over.

40|$|Wheat is a {{major source}} of protein in the diets of humans and {{livestock}} but we know little about the mechanisms that determine the patterns of protein synthesis in the developing endosperm. We have used a combination of enrichment with 15 N glutamine and NanoSIMS imaging to establish that the substrate required for protein synthesis is transported radially from its point of entrance in the endosperm cavity across the <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> tissues, before becoming concentrated in the cells immediately below the aleurone layer. This transport occurs continuously during grain development but may be slower in the later stages. Although older <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> cells tend to contain larger protein deposits formed by the fusion of small protein bodies, small highly enriched protein bodies were also oberved in the same cell m.

40|$|Activity {{measurements}} and Northern blot hybridizations {{were used to}} study the temporal and spatial expression of carboxypeptidase I in germinating grains of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Himalaya). In the resting grain no carboxypeptidase I activity {{was found in the}} aleurone layer, scutellum, or <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm.</b> During germination high levels of enzyme activity appeared in the scutellum and in the <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> but only low activity was found in the aleurone layer. No mRNA for carboxypeptidase I was observed in the resting grain. By day 1 of germination the mRNA appeared in the scutellum where its level remained high for several days. In contrast, little mRNA was observed in the aleurone layer. These results indicate that the scutellum {{plays an important role in}} the production of carboxypeptidase I in germinating barley grain...|$|E
40|$|A {{histological}} {{method for}} detecting of 5 -n-alkylresorcinols in grains sections using the staining with Fast Blue B was developed. Taking {{advantage of that}} method {{it was found that}} alkylresorcinols are localized exclusively in the outer cuticle, but both germs and <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> of rye and wheat seeds are entirely free of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} gradients in gluten protein composition are established during grain development. These gradients {{may be due}} to the origin of subaleurone cells, which unlike other <b>starchy</b> <b>endosperm</b> cells derive from the re-differentiation of aleurone cells, but could also result from the action of specific regulatory signals produced by the maternal tissue on specific domains of the gluten protein gene promoters...|$|E
