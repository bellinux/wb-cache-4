50|$|Mineral jigs or gravity {{concentrators}} {{were designed}} to allow for separation of materials with different densities. This process is accomplished by flowing a stream of liquid-suspended material over a screen and subjecting the screen to a vertical hydraulic pulsation. This pulsation momentarily expands or dilates the <b>screen</b> <b>bed</b> and allows the heavier materials to work toward the bottom. Heavier material, or concentrate, that is finer than the screen openings will gradually work through the beds and the retention screen into the hutch, or lower compartment. That material, the concentrate, is continuously discharged from this compartment or hutch through a spigot. If the concentrate is coarser than the screen, it will work down {{to the top of}} the shot bed, and can be withdrawn either continuously or intermittently. The lighter material, or tailing, will be rejected over the end of the jig.|$|E
40|$|Complete and {{effective}} elimination of common bed bug (Cimex lectularius) infestations {{continues to be}} a challenge for the pest management industry. However, effective bed bug control can be achieved through integrated pest management (IPM) programs that use a variety of control techniques. An integral component of an IPM program is the type of insecticide applied. However, insecticide products for bed bug control are somewhat limited as resistance to some pyrethroid insecticides, such as deltamethrin has developed. Currently, chlorfenapyr and bifenthrin are two insecticides approved for bed bug control. Chlorfenapyr is a pro-insecticide from the pyrrole class. Bifenthrin is a type-I pyrethroid that can be applied indoors, but it is also available to the general public and therefore {{has the potential to be}} misused for bed bug control. Insecticide resistance is an inevitable consequence of widespread and continuous insecticide application when the proper strategies are not implemented. If bed bugs develop resistance to chlorfenapyr and bifenthrin, it would significantly inhibit the effective management of these notorious pests. Notwithstanding, the susceptibility levels of field bed bug populations to chlorfenapyr and bifenthrin have not been determined on a large scale. Due to the impending threat of insecticide resistance, the primary goal of this research was to <b>screen</b> <b>bed</b> bug populations from across the United States for chlorfenapyr and bifenthrin susceptibility. To screen the field populations, a diagnostic bioassay-based susceptibility monitoring program was developed and implemented. ^ Filter paper and glass vial bioassay methods were compared for different formulations (technical grade and formulated product) of chlorfenapyr and bifenthrin to determine the most suitable assay and formulation for susceptibility monitoring. For each treatment type, lethal concentration (LC 50 and LC 99) estimates were determined with the insecticide-susceptible Harlan strain. Statistical comparison of PROBIT analysis data for bioassay techniques found significant differences in toxicity ratios at the LC 50 and LC 99 levels. Based on the toxicity ratios and bioassay duration, glass vial bioassays using formulated insecticide product appeared more effective for chlorfenapyr and bifenthrin susceptibility monitoring. The glass vial diagnostic LC 99 concentrations for chlorfenapyr and bifenthrin were validated using the Harlan-Susceptible and field-collected (Washington D. C. and Richmond, VA) bed bug populations. Subsequently, eight additional field bed bug populations collected from geographically different regions around the U. S. were screened for chlorfenapyr and bifenthrin susceptibility with the diagnostic glass vial assay. Three of the field collected bed bug populations were resistant to chlorfenapyr when compared to the Harlan susceptible strain. Five of the ten populations had significantly different bifenthrin susceptibilities when compared to the Harlan strain at the LC 99 concentration. These findings demonstrate the need for continuous susceptibility monitoring of bed bug populations to ensure insecticides remain effective. ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the LET-SME program funded by the European Space Agency, ALTA S. p. A. (Italy) and DELTACAT Ltd. (United Kingdom) jointly investigated the use of advanced catalytic beds on ceramic supports as a cost-effective alternative to metal screen reactors for the decomposition of high-concentration hydrogen peroxide in small monopropellant rockets. To this purpose ALTA S. p. A. designed and realized a reconfigurable test bench for the characterization of the operation and propulsive performance of small rocket thrusters. The present paper illustrates the experimental campaign carried out on a 5 N thruster prototype operating with two platinum catalysts on g− alumina supporting spheres, especially developed by ALTA in collaboration with the Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry Department of Pisa University, Italy. The results indicated that Pt/Al 2 O 3 is an effective catalyst combination for the decomposition of 87. 5 % propellant grade hydrogen peroxide, with good stability and performance comparable to silver <b>screen</b> <b>beds</b> of equal geometric envelope and operational conditions. Incomplete hydrogen peroxide decomposition and the onset of flow oscillations in the reactor were observed at the tested levels of bed loading, residence time and flow pressure. Thermal stresses due to the large temperature gradients occurring during the decomposition of high grade hydrogen peroxide (87. 5 % by weight) caused the ceramic pellets to break and the progressive occlusion of the bed.

After WWII, the UK Black Knight rocket program associated kerosene with H 2 O 2 and a silver <b>screen</b> catalyst <b>bed.</b> The beginning of the space programs led to the replacement of H 2 O 2 by more stable hydrazine, using Ir/Al 2 O 3 catalysts, for satellites and launchers. In recent years, hydrazine substitutes (called "green propellants") have been proposed to satisfy new environmental concerns, improve performance, and reduce cost. The most studied substitutes are energetic aqueous ionic mixtures containing an ionic oxidizer and a fuel. Commonly studied oxidizers are hydroxylammonium nitrate or ammonium dinitramide.
