500|$|By then, the {{positions}} of the two countries had reversed from what they were in 1941. The Americans had become suspicious that the British were seeking commercial advantages after the war, and Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., who took over command of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942, wanted to tighten security with a policy of strict compartmentalisation similar to the one that the British had imposed on radar. American officials decided that the United States no longer needed outside help. The Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, felt that since the United States was doing [...] "ninety percent of the work" [...] on the bomb, it would be [...] "better for us to go along for the present without sharing anything more than we could help". In December 1942, Roosevelt agreed to restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war, even if doing so slowed down the American project. In retaliation, the British stopped <b>sending</b> <b>information</b> and scientists to America, and the Americans then stopped all information sharing.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the weeks}} before the race, the sport's {{governing}} body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile's (FIA) race director Charlie Whiting, announced plans to introduce a ban on certain pit-to-car communications, with a particular emphasis on banning driver [...] "coaching"—such as describing a driver's sector times relative to another competitor—under Article 20.1 of the sporting regulations, which state that a driver must drive the car [...] "alone and unaided". Additionally, the FIA banned teams from sending drivers coded messages in the week running up to the Grand Prix either through radio or pit board, and at the next race {{of the season in}} Japan, they would be prohibited from <b>sending</b> <b>information</b> concerning the tyres and brake wear. After team principals raised concerns about the extent of the ban three days before the race, the FIA revised what teams could tell their drivers over the radio, including car performance and safety concerns. After persistent media speculation about his future at Caterham, the team confirmed that Kamui Kobayashi would take part in the race.|$|E

Upon this, the Jewish excitability, {{vibrating}} between the desire of gain and the terror of consequences, assumed a new form. Some of them groaned; some of them twisted their fingers frantically in their hair; some of them called on the Deity worshipped by their fathers to bear witness how they had suffered, by dispensing with references in other cases of precious deposits; one supremely aged and dirty Jew actually suggested placing an embargo on the lady and her necklace, and <b>sending</b> <b>information</b> to the city authorities at the Town Hall. In the case of a timid woman, this sage's advice might actually have been followed. Madame Fontaine preserved her presence of mind, and left the Judengasse as freely as she had entered it.

6000|$|There were Tories in {{the town}} who gave the enemy all the {{information}} they could gather; therefore much caution was necessary in making plans, lest these enemies should betray them. Pass-words were adopted, secret signals used, and messages sent {{from house to house}} in all sorts of queer ways. Such a message lay hidden under the eggs in Tabby's basket, and the brave little girl was going on an important errand from her uncle, Captain David Brown, to Deacon Cyrus Hosmer, who lived {{at the other end of}} the town, by the South Bridge. She had been employed several times before in the same way, and had proved herself quick-witted, stout-hearted, and light-footed. Now, as she trotted along in her scarlet cloak and hood, she was wishing she could still further distinguish herself by some great act of heroism; for good Parson Emerson had patted her on the head and said, [...] "Well done, child!" [...] when he heard how she ran all the way to Captain Barrett's, in the night, to warn him that Doctor Lee, the Tory, had been detected <b>sending</b> <b>information</b> of certain secret plans to the enemy.|$|E
60|$|The {{expedition}} under {{command of}} Brevet Major-General Wilson, consisting of twelve thousand five hundred mounted men, was delayed by rains until March 22d, when it moved from Chickasaw, Alabama. On the 1st of April, General Wilson encountered {{the enemy in}} force under Forrest near Ebenezer Church, drove him in confusion, captured three hundred prisoners and three guns, and destroyed the central bridge over the Cahawba River. On the 2d he attacked and captured the fortified city of Selma, defended by Forrest, with seven thousand men and thirty-two guns, destroyed the arsenal, armory, naval foundry, machine-shops, vast quantities of stores, and captured three thousand prisoners. On the 4th he captured and destroyed Tuscaloosa. On the 10th he crossed the Alabama River, and after <b>sending</b> <b>information</b> of his operations to General Canby, marched on Montgomery, which place he occupied on the 14th, the enemy having abandoned it. At this place many stores and five steamboats fell into our hands. Thence a force marched direct on Columbus, and another on West Point, both of which places were assaulted and captured on the 16th. At the former place we got one thousand five hundred prisoners and fifty-two field-guns, destroyed two gunboats, the navy yard, foundries, arsenal, many factories, and much other public property. At the latter place we got three hundred prisoners, four guns, and destroyed nineteen locomotives and three hundred cars. On the 20th he took possession of Macon, Georgia, with sixty field-guns, one thousand two hundred militia, and five generals, surrendered by General Howell Cobb. General Wilson, hearing that Jeff. Davis {{was trying to make}} his escape, sent forces in pursuit and succeeded in capturing him on the morning of May 11th.|$|E
