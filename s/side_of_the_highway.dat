5|$|Due to {{the flat}} {{topography}} of Essex County, the land use surrounding Highway77 is almost entirely agricultural. Soil conditions in Essex are ideal for farming, {{and as a result}} very few natural areas {{can be found in the}} county. Many streams have been diverted to irrigate the endless farmland to either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> Relief from the plain is provided only by the few hamlets along the route. In addition, Lake Erie and Lake St Clair are both a short distance from Highway 77.|$|E
5|$|Few {{buildings}} are {{left on the}} north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> The most notable are the wooden Southern Pacific saltbox-style section house and workers' bunkhouse, both built in 1887.

SR-103 begins its progression eastward, passing between two commercial complexes. After a {{crossing of the}} Davis Weber Canal, the sidewalk on the southern side of the roadway turns to the south to follow the canal forming the Clearfield Canal Trail. SR-103 highway turns to the northeast, intersecting with the southbound on-ramp and off-ramp to Interstate15 (I-15). After this intersection, SR-103 expands to five lanes, and crosses under the southbound and northbound lanes of I-15.

5|$|The southernmost {{part of the}} Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, {{from south}} of DE 10 to north of Bay Road, was placed under {{construction}} in 1990 and opened along with the DoverSmyrna portion of DE 1 in 1993. US 113 traffic needed to use a temporary tie-in during construction, and after the new freeway opened, traffic on the U.S. Highway needed to use Exit 95 to transfer between the new freeway and Bay Road. The extension of the DE 1 freeway south through Dover Air Force Base was constructed later due {{to the need to}} coordinate negotiations with the military installation and to allow the base to remediate hazardous material sites, maintain security and access restrictions with construction of a new main gate, and reconstruct base housing on the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> The main gate to Dover Air Force base was moved further east, and a diamond interchange was built between the main gate and the base housing area.
