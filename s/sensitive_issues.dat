5|$|Weiquan {{lawyers have}} also {{challenged}} {{the application of}} state secret laws, which are sometimes used to prosecute individuals who disseminate information on politically <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues.</b> In November 2009, for instance, lawyers were involved in arguing for Huang Qi, a Sichuan activist who had advocated online for the parents of Sichuan earthquake victims. Huang was sentenced {{to three years in}} prison for possession of state secrets.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{despite a}} {{symbolic}} emphasis on royal power, Henry's rule was relatively circumscribed and constitutional. He generally acted within {{the terms of}} the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under John. The charters did not address the <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court. The inconsistency with which he applied the charters {{over the course of his}} rule alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{placed a}} {{symbolic}} emphasis on rebuilding royal authority, but his rule was relatively circumscribed by Magna Carta. He generally acted within {{the terms of}} the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under his father, John. The charters did not address the <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them.

5|$|In May 1945 an Interim Committee {{was created}} to advise and report on wartime and postwar {{policies}} {{regarding the use of}} nuclear energy. The Interim Committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee the scientific panel offered its opinion not just on the likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its likely military and political impact. This included opinions on such <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> as whether or not the Soviet Union should be advised of the weapon in advance of its use against Japan.|$|E
25|$|In 1816, the chief's council named Ross to {{his first}} {{delegation}} to American leaders in Washington D.C.

Only Ross was fluent in English, making him a central figure, although Cherokee society traditionally favored older leaders.|$|E

25|$|Argentina's {{most active}} female {{figure in the}} revolutionary process, Mariquita Sánchez, was Buenos Aires' leading salonnière. She fervently embraced the cause of revolution, and her tertulia {{gathered}} all the leading personalities of her time. The most <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> were discussed there, as well as literary topics. Mariquita Sánchez is widely remembered in the Argentine historical tradition because the Argentine National Anthem was sung {{for the first time}} in her house, on 14 May 1813.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan has a {{long and}} strong {{relationship}} with China. The long-standing ties {{between the two countries}} have been mutually beneficial. A close identity of views and mutual interests remain the centre-point of bilateral ties.

25|$|Prior to {{becoming}} Prime Minister, Bildt {{had been a}} strong supporter of the three Baltic nations, and during his period as PM devoted considerable efforts to trying to assist the three now again independent Baltic states in handling their immediate challenges in form of withdrawal of ex-Soviet forces and strategic installations, as well as deciding on <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> of citizenship. In this he worked closely together with the leaders of the three countries as well as with Russia Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev.|$|E

25|$|The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress vote in December 2007 {{to allow}} {{universal}} suffrage by 2017, and full Legislative Council elections by 2020, tempered {{the debate on}} universal suffrage. Wary of political parties, the government sought to defer discussion on other highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> until October 2008, {{in the hopes that}} the election will be void of focus. The election was therefore fought over issues regarding the minimum wage, health care reform, Old Age Allowance, and the future of RTHK. Also, the case surrounding former Housing Director Leung Chin-man served to highlight the issue of systematic checks and balances, and the lack of political scrutiny of government actions.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} urban youth {{growing up in}} the working-class neighborhoods of Antananarivo, Rossy casually improvised with his friends to create songs in the vakisôva genre. This {{contemporary}} Malagasy musical genre is characterized by politically and socially incisive lyrics delivered a capella in a rhythmic, rap-like style over complex hand-clapping beats. Long after vakisôva performance launched his career, Rossy continued to draw upon its rhythms and sensibilities as a vehicle for expressing bold political and social critique while capitalizing on the genre's dance-inducing entertainment value. As a consequence, {{by the time he had}} achieved national popularity under his stage name Rossy in the early 1990s, he had developed a reputation for speaking truth to power and being unafraid to address <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> through his music. Many of Rossy's songs raise awareness of such issues as environmental degradation and poor governance.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of the Master of the Revels was to supervise the arrangements for entertainments presented at court, at the various royal residences or wherever the monarch was in attendance, and to censor plays before they were performed in public theatres. Buck was thus responsible for censoring, among other works, Shakespeare's later plays, and for supervising performances of them and of any earlier Shakespeare plays revived for court performance, which he had to re-censor, due to the regulations added against blasphemy in 1606. Buck noted on the title page of the play George-a-Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield that he had discussed its authorship with Shakespeare. Censorship was exercised in matters of profanity and in <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> of religion and politics, particularly the portrayal of royalty. Judging from his notes in the two manuscript play scripts that show his hand, The Second Maiden's Tragedy (1611) and John van Olden Barnavelt (1619), Buck was conscientious and learned, but gentle in his censorship.|$|E

25|$|In the {{archives}} of the Salesian Congregation is a contract of apprenticeship, dated November 1851; another one on stamped paper costing 40 cents, dated February 8, 1852; and others with later dates. These are among the first contracts of apprenticeship to be found in Turin. All of them are signed by the employer, the apprentice and Don Bosco. In those contracts, Don Bosco touched on many <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues.</b> Some employers customarily made servants and scullery-boys of the apprentices. Don Bosco obliged them to agree to employ the boys only in their acknowledged trade. Employers used to beat the boys. Don Bosco required them to agree that corrections be made only verbally. He cared for their health, and demanded that they be given rest on feast days, and that they be given an annual holiday. But {{in spite of all the}} efforts and contracts, the situation of the apprentices of the time remained difficult.|$|E
25|$|The first volume, Les géants pétrifiés by Fabien Vehlmann and Yoann, had {{a modern}} storyline and art, not {{dissimilar}} in spirit to Morvan and Munuera's work. The second volume, Les marais du temps, by Frank Le Gall, is drawn {{in a more}} classic style not dissimilar to The Adventures of Tintin and Théodore Poussin, Le Gall's own comic series. The third, Le tombeau des Champignac, by Yann and Fabrice Tarrin, is a slightly modernized homage to Franquin's classic period. The fourth, Journal d'un ingénu, by Emile Bravo, is a novelistic homage to the original Rob-Vel and Jijé's universes and stories, and was released to critical acclaim, being awarded at the Angoulême festival. The fifth, Le groom vert-de-gris by Yann and Olivier Schwartz, is based on one of Yann's old scripts from the 80's originally intended to have been drawn by Chaland, while the editor rejected it. Yann picked up the artist Schwartz, working in a similar style, to complete the story. The story takes place among the resistance movement in the Nazi-occupied Belgium. Unlike traditional Spirou stories, but similar to other works by Yann, the story features rather much dark humour and political satire. It was released once again to some acclaim but also attracted controversy for its cavalier approach to <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues.</b> The sixth album, Panique en Atlantique, authored by Lewis Trondheim and Fabrice Parme, was released on April 16, 2010.|$|E

Hollyoaks has a strong track record of dealing with <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues,</b> and the transmission will be followed by a programme support announcement directing viewers to a 24-hour helpline.|$|E

Aguslia, writing for Tempo, said that it was better than the 2010 Citra Award winner 3 Hati Dua Dunia, Satu Cinta, which had similar themes. Kartoyo DS, reviewing for Suara Karya after a press screening, praised the plot, visuals, and music.|$|E
500|$|At a {{press conference}} on 30 November 1950, Truman {{was asked about the}} use of nuclear weapons: The {{implication}} was that the authority to use atomic weapons now rested in the hands of MacArthur. Truman's White House issued a clarification, noting that [...] "only the President can authorize the use of the atom bomb, and no such authorization has been given," [...] yet the comment still caused a domestic and international stir. Truman had touched upon one of the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> in civil-military relations in the post-World War II period: civilian control of nuclear weapons, which was enshrined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1946.|$|E
500|$|One of the Parliament's {{justifications}} for restricting judicial review {{in response to}} Chng Suan Tze was that national security is [...] "not a judicial decision" [...] and is not capable of [...] "objective evaluation by the courts".

In fact, the court applied the doctrine of justiciability which recognizes that the limits of judicial review in politically <b>sensitive</b> <b>issues</b> is better left to the discretion of the executive.|$|E
