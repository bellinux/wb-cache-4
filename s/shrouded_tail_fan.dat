25|$|The SH09 is a light-medium helicopter, {{powered by}} a single Honeywell HTS900 {{turboshaft}} engine. It uses a <b>shrouded</b> fenestron <b>tail</b> rotor and the main rotor features a five-bladed bearingless hub; the <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> rotor has a wider diameter and a thinner chord {{in order to increase}} airflow, while design aspects such as a narrow tail boom, swept-back tips on the main rotor blades, and the <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> rotor purposefully reduce the SH09's noise signature. The HTS900 is capable of providing 1,020-shaft-horsepower, which is reportedly enough to produce high performance levels for the SH09 under hot and high conditions.|$|R
50|$|The KC 518 is a {{composite}} fuselage helicopter kit for amateur construction. The airframe uses a carbon fiber and kevlar composite fuselage with a <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> rotor. An auxiliary fuel system can be installed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Comparison of {{the health}} of spiny {{lobsters}} (Jasus edwardsii) within and adjacent to a New Zealand marine reserve revealed marked differences {{in the incidence of}} a handling-related bacterial infection. Lobsters outside the reserve were significantly more affected by <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> necrosis than lobsters within the reserve, with up to 17 % of the males caught outside the reserve over a 3 -year period showing signs of <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> necrosis, compared with less than 2 % within the reserve. The incidence of <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> necrosis changed abruptly at the marine reserve boundaries, strongly implying repeated handling as the causal agent. The incidence of <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> necrosis in males increased up to the minimum legal size, consistent with a handling effect. Female lobsters, which comprise only a small proportion of the catch in this area, were comparatively unaffected by <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> necrosis. There {{was no significant difference in}} the recapture rates of individuals tagged either with or without <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> necrosis, but tagged individuals outside the reserve were more likely to develop <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> necrosis than tagged individuals within the reserve. These findings have implications for both the dynamics of the lobster populations and their management, and highlight the role of marine protected areas in providing a baseline against which such effects of fishing can be assessed...|$|R

5|$|The abdomen is {{composed}} of five somites, all of which lack appendages except the last. The back-facing margins of these somites bear small spines and four or more larger spines. The last abdominal somite forks {{into a pair of}} flattened spatulate appendages (the uropods) that function as a <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> (caudal rami). In addition to stabilising the body while swimming, a quick flick of the <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> can rapidly propel the animal backwards, which may have functioned as a means of escaping predators like in modern shrimp. Traces of four fused segments are evident in the three faint lines dividing each lobe of the <b>tail</b> <b>fan.</b> A long telson is present {{at the end of the}} body. Traces of a rounded stomach, small digestive glands, and an intestine that terminates into a tiny anal opening on the telson can also be observed in some specimens.|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s, Bruno Guimbal, {{while working}} at Eurocopter upon the Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin and Eurocopter EC120 Colibri helicopters, decided to {{independently}} pursue {{the development of a}} two-seat piston engine helicopter. This rotorcraft would incorporate numerous safety-related and general technological advances commonly applied to larger turbine-powered rotorcraft, but typically absent from piston-engine helicopters. These technologies included Eurocopter's Fenestron anti-torque <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> rotor and Spheriflex main rotor, in addition to a composite fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage fairing is {{made from}} composites. Its 21 ft diameter main rotor employs an ATI 012 (VR-7 mod) airfoil at the blade root, becoming an ATI 008 (VR-7 mod) at the tip. The main and tail rotor blades are of honeycomb composite construction. The cyclic control is roof-mounted, hanging down into the cockpit, but is otherwise conventional. The 23 in diameter tail rotor features a <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> rotor and a tailplane with end-fins.|$|R
50|$|Evidence for {{stochastic}} resonance in a sensory system was first found in nerve {{signals from the}} mechanoreceptors located on the <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> of the crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). An appendage from the <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> was mechanically stimulated to trigger the cuticular hairs that the crayfish uses to detect pressure waves in water. The stimulus consisted of sinusoidal motion at 55.2 Hz with random Gaussian noise at varying levels of average intensity. Spikes along the nerve root of the terminal abdominal ganglion were recorded extracellularly for 11 cells and analyzed to determine the SNR.|$|R
50|$|The Bell 400 TwinRanger {{featured}} a reprofiled fuselage, two Allison 250 turboshafts, the OH-58D Kiowa's four-bladed main rotor, {{and a new}} <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> rotor. Bell also planned the single-engine 400A, and the 440 twin with a larger fuselage {{made possible by a}} high degree of composites. The Bell 400 first flew on April 4, 1984. Bell suspended development of the 400/440 family in the late 1980s as it felt unable to achieve a profitable production rate of 120 units a year.|$|R
25|$|The abdomen {{is divided}} into two parts: the pleosome which bears {{swimming}} legs; and the urosome, which comprises a telson and three pairs of uropods which do not form a <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> as they do in animals such as true shrimp.|$|R
40|$|Development of {{advanced}} rotorcraft configurations has highlighted {{a need for}} high-quality experimental data to support the development of flexible and accurate analytical design tools. To provide this type of data, a test program was conducted in the Langley 14 - by 22 -Foot Subsonic Tunnel to measure the flow near the empennage of a 15 -percent scale powered helicopter model with an operating <b>tail</b> <b>fan.</b> Three-component velocity profiles were measured with laser velocimetry (LV) one chord forward of the horizontal tail for four advance ratios to evaluate {{the effect of the}} rotor wake impingement on the horizontal tail angle of attack. These velocity data indicate the horizontal tail can experience unsteady angle of attack variations of over 30 degrees due to the rotor wake influence. The horizontal tail is most affected by the rotor wake above advance ratios of 0. 10. Velocity measurements of the flow on the inlet side of the <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> were made for a low-speed flight condition using conventional LV techniques. The velocity data show an accelerated flow near the <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> duct, and vorticity calculations track the passage of main rotor wake vortices through the measurement plane...|$|R
25|$|A close relative, the confuciusornithid Changchengornis hengdaoziensis, also {{lived in}} the Yixian Formation. Changchengornis also possessed the paired, long tail feathers, as did several more {{advanced}} enantiornith birds. True, mobile <b>tail</b> <b>fans</b> only appeared in ornithuromorph birds, and possibly in the enantiornithine Shanweiniao.|$|R
50|$|Thor amboinensis {{is a small}} shrimp {{growing to}} a length of about 13 mm. It is an olive brown colour with symmetrically placed white patches edged with thin blue lines. It {{characteristically}} carries its abdomen curved upwards with its <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> above its head.|$|R
500|$|There {{is a clear}} {{demarcation}} {{between the}} thorax and the six or seven-segmented abdomen. In most taxa, each abdominal segment except the last carries a pair of biramous pleopods used for swimming, burrowing, gas exchange, creating a current or brooding eggs. The first and second abdominal pleopods may be modified in the male to form gonopods (accessory copulatory appendages). The appendages of the last segment are typically flattened into uropods, which together with the terminal telson, make up the [...] "tail fan". It is the sudden flexion of this <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> that provides the thrust for the rapid escape response of these crustaceans and the <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> is also used in steering. [...] In Leptostraca, the appendages on the telson instead form caudal rami (spine-like protrusions).|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} season is February to August in India and courtship involves ritual feeding, bowing and <b>tail</b> <b>fanning.</b> Nest excavation may begin {{a month before}} the laying of eggs. The nest is a deep tunnel in a mud bank within which four very spherical and white eggs are laid.|$|R
50|$|Dinochelus ausubeli has a {{carapace}} length of around 31 mm, {{and is in}} life mostly translucent white, with reddish pink colouring near {{the middle of the}} carapace, on the <b>tail</b> <b>fan,</b> on the antennae, and on the first pereiopods (including the claws). Its two claws are very different in size.|$|R
50|$|Like other corvids, black-billed magpies {{indulge in}} anting (applying ants onto their plumage) and sun-bathing (back facing the sun, head down, wings drooped and spread wide, <b>tail</b> <b>fanned,</b> back {{feathers}} fluffed up). They also belong to {{that group of}} birds that scratch their head with their foot over the wing.|$|R

50|$|Mysis is a small, {{transparent}} shrimp-like crustacean, {{less than}} 25 mm in length. It has {{two pairs of}} relatively long antennae, associated with rounded antennal plates; large, stalked compound eyes; the thorax covered by a coat-like carapace; a muscular, cylindrical abdomen; and a <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> featuring a telson with a V-shaped terminal cleft.|$|R
5000|$|Airbus Helicopters and its {{predecessor}} companies {{have established a}} wide range of helicopter firsts, including the first production turboshaft-powered helicopter (the Aérospatiale Alouette II of 1955); the introduction of the Fenestron <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> rotor (on the Gazelle of 1968); the first helicopter certified for full flight in icing conditions (the AS332 Super Puma, in 1984); the first production helicopter with a Fly-by-wire control system (the NHIndustries NH90, first flown in full FBW mode in 2003); the first helicopter to use a Fly-by-light primary control system (an EC135 testbed, first flown in 2003); and the first ever landing of a helicopter on Mt. Everest (achieved by an AS350 B3 in 2005).|$|R
50|$|Baltimore orioles are {{basically}} solitary outside their mating season. The species {{is generally considered}} monogamous, although evidence suggests that extra-pair copulation is reasonably common. In the spring, males establish a territory then display to females by singing and chattering while hopping from perch to perch in front of them. Males also give a bow display, bowing with wings lowered and <b>tail</b> <b>fanned.</b> Depending on their receptiveness, the females may ignore these displays or sing and give calls or a wing-quiver display in response. The wing-quiver display involves leaning forward, often with <b>tail</b> partly <b>fanned,</b> and fluttering or quivering slightly lowered wings.|$|R
50|$|At dusk {{during the}} {{breeding}} season, the males display at a lek (arena), standing erect with chest puffed and <b>tail</b> <b>fanned</b> out. They may {{jump into the}} air, and will produce a variety of rattles, clicks, buzzes and whistles while displaying. Three to four eggs are laid in a well-hidden nest on the ground.|$|R

5000|$|When {{the sensory}} hairs of the <b>tail</b> <b>fan</b> of {{crayfish}} are stimulated, the LG activates the motor neurons that control flexion {{movements of the}} abdomen {{in the way that}} propels the crayfish away from the source of the stimulation.

25|$|In November 2015, it was {{announced}} that certification of the H160 and its entry into service with civil operators were both scheduled to take place in 2018; a military-orientated variant, designated H160M, is aimed to enter service in 2022. In March 2016, H160 program chief Bernard Fujarski stated that nearly all milestones set for 2015 had been achieved, save for the second prototype's first flight having being delayed to January 2016, and that the H160’s aerodynamic configuration had been validated. Testing had revealed a need to relocate some electronics systems to the rotorcraft's nose from the rear portion of the main fuselage for center of gravity reasons, while the fenestron <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> rotor had reportedly exceeded performance expectations.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Eurocopter officially {{launched}} an upgraded EC145 model, designated EC145 T2, unveiling the new type at Heli Expo 2011. The EC145 T2 {{is designed to}} significantly increase the aircraft's performance, featuring new Arriel 2E turboshaft engines, dual-digital Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC), Eurocopter's Fenestron <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> rotor design, and upgraded tail and main rotor gear boxes. Considerable differences and improvements {{were introduced to the}} cockpit and aircraft subsystems, including the adoption of increasingly digital avionics and a fully modular approach to these systems; amongst the biggest changes is a sophisticated 4-axis autopilot. In April 2014, airworthiness certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency for the EC145 T2 was received, FAA certification followed in October 2014.|$|R
