First, {{the question}} of motivation. How do we explain calls for burden-sharing beyond the state? Second, the question of patterns. How do we explain patterns of <b>burden-sharing</b> <b>in</b> the international arena? In order to address these questions, {{the first part of}} the paper proposes and analyses two burden-sharing approaches—one based on a 'cost-benefit'-, the other one based on a 'norm-based' logic—that offer partly competing and partly complementary hypotheses for answering these two questions. The second part, analyses EU attempts to share burdens in the area of forced migration in order to test these hypotheses empirically. The results suggest that although there is still little evidence for inter-state <b>solidarity</b> <b>in</b> the EU, norm-based approaches can nonetheless offer some powerful explanations of European <b>burden-sharing</b> <b>in</b> this area...|$|R

3000|$|In this {{commentary}} I {{reflect on}} the possibility of <b>solidarity</b> <b>in</b> diversity, both in conceptual and empirical terms, by thinking with and beyond Zapata-Barrero and Modood (Modood, 2017; Zapata-Barrero, 2017). My aim is not so much to choose sides in the debate between multiculturalism and interculturalism, but to integrate elements of both perspectives in an analytical framework that does not a priori – on political-philosophical or policy grounds – privilege one source of <b>solidarity</b> <b>in</b> diversity over another and looks at their articulation in concrete empirical cases. Although normative and policy-based arguments are valuable and often draw extensively on concrete experiences, we need to move beyond these and engage in on-the-ground empirical analysis of how new forms of <b>solidarity</b> <b>in</b> diversity are nurtured in everyday life. What I propose here is not an empiricist analysis devoid of conceptual thinking, but a sociological approach of living in diversity in contemporary society as a ‘social fact’ to be analysed empirically (see Kivisto, 2012 for a similar argument). I will draw on classical sociological theory to distinguish four sources of solidarity, which I argue are more adequately capturing the complex, multiple and overlapping sources of actually existing <b>solidarities</b> <b>in</b> diversity. I will illustrate this argument with stylized examples from a large-scale collaborative research project on innovative forms of <b>solidarity</b> <b>in</b> diversity. 1 [...]...|$|R
