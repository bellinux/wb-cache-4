40|$|Belief <b>maintenance</b> <b>systems</b> {{are natural}} {{extensions}} of truth <b>maintenance</b> <b>systems</b> that use probabilities rather than boolean truth-values. This paper introduces a general method for belief maintenance, based on (the propositional fragment of) probabilistic logic, that extends the Boolean Constraint Propagation method {{used by the}} logic-based truth <b>maintenance</b> <b>systems.</b> From the concept of probabilistic entailment, we derive a set of constraints on the (probabilistic) truth-values of propositions and we prove their soundness. These constraints are complete {{with respect to a}} well-defined set of clauses, and their partial incompleteness is compensated by a gain in computational efficiency. 1 Introduction Truth <b>maintenance</b> <b>systems</b> (tmss) are independent reasoning modules which incrementally maintain the beliefs of a general problem solving system, enabling it to reason with temporary assumptions in the growth of incomplete information.

Introduction In 1978 Jon Doyle wrote a masters thesis at the MIT AI Laboratory entitled "Truth <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Systems</b> for Problem Solving" [Doyle, 1979]. In this thesis Doyle described an independent module called a truth <b>maintenance</b> <b>system,</b> or TMS, which maintained beliefs for general problem solving systems. In the twelve years since the appearance of Doyle's TMS a large body of literature has accumulated on truth maintenance. The seminal idea appears not to have been any particular technical mechanism but rather the general concept of an independent module for truth (or belief) maintenance. All truth <b>maintenance</b> <b>systems</b> manipulate proposition symbols and relationships between proposition symbols. I will use [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a logically complete assumption based truth <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> (ATMS) {{that is part}} of a complex blast furnace computer aided piloting system [5]. This system is built on an efficient and logically complete propositional constraint solver that has been successfully used for industrial applications in computer aided design. 1 Introduction A reasoning <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> (RMS) is a critical part of a reasoning system, since it is responsible for assuring that the inferences made by that system are valid. The reasoning system provides the RMS with information about each inference it performs, and in return the RMS provides the reasoning system with information about the whole set of inferences. Several implementations of reasoning <b>maintenance</b> <b>systems</b> have been proposed in the past, remarkable ones being Doyle's truth <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> (TMS) [6], and De Kleer's assumption-based truth <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> (ATMS) [7].
