The <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> sheet inserts may be constructed {{of a combination of}} materials selected and configured such that sound impinging upon the curtain is absorbed or alternatively reflected. The sound shielding curtain can be tuned to insulate an area from a select range of frequencies inherent in select environments. Tuning may be accomplished through the selection and installation of <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> sheet inserts configured to reflect or absorb audible acoustical energy. The <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> sheet inserts are readily removable to permit periodic laundering of the curtain fabric and to provide adaptability for a number of applications. Sound shielding curtain(s) can be selected, configured, installed, and extended in such a manner as to provide sound reduction in a localized space.

40|$|Availability of low-frequency {{characteristics}} of <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> elements {{is required in}} order to achieve efficient control of noise sources and reduced level of annoyance in the low-frequency range. Previous work by the author has addressed the problem of designing an enhanced calculation environment for the estimation of sound Transmission Loss (TL). In this work, numerical prediction of TL of <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> structures is performed using a procedure, which is in compliance with the ISO recommendations for acoustic measurements. The room-structure-room finite element representation, employed to solve sound propagation and sound-structure interaction problems, as well as the dynamic coupling of and the sound energy propagation through successive air-structure layers are investigated. Several cases of single-layered plain structures of common <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> materials such as steel, glass and aluminium with various thickness values are modelled and the calculated TL is compared with published experimental results. It is shown that although the detailed dynamic response of the structures is not accurately predicted due to uncertain parameters, such as the test-specimens dimension and vaguely known boundary conditions, the octave band averaged TL is sufficiently predicted {{for the majority of the}} tested materials. Extension of the method to multi-layered structures is attempted and discrepancies at low frequencies are depicted. Finally, the effect of poor mode distribution of the measurement rooms upon the estimated TL is examined in focus. Comparison is performed between TL values calculated with typical and intensely modified transmission rooms. The low-frequency improvement on measurements, when the second ones are used, is demonstrated. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Since wood is porous {{it also is}} a good {{heat and}} <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> material.

In this study, Trema orientalis wood was first treated with nitric acid aqueous solution to damage the S 3 layer of cell walls, followed by puffing the cell wall inward with saturated urea and ZnCl 2 solutions. Results indicated that treating Trema orientalis with 10 % nitric acid at 100 oC for 20 minute damaged the S 3 layer of cell walls, and the subsequent treatment with urea and ZnCl 2 saturated solutions caused the fiber tracheid walls to swell up to 76 %. Then, the swollen material was dried with critical CO 2 fluid to obtain puffed wood.

We define the temporal (real) and spectral (complex) variations of POD to tackle acoustical and structural degrees of freedom.
