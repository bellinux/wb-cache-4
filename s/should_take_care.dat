It believes that the public sector should only be there to secure a minimum standard of living, and that individuals, businesses and organisations <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of various tasks instead of the public sector, in most cases. The party also generally advocates the lowering of taxes, various duties, as well increased market economy.|$|E
5|$|In La Paz, the Municipal Direction of Civil defense {{informed}} that the first of 13temporary shelters would be opened and anticipated the evacuation of more than 2000people that lived in high-risk zones. In some areas, the local police recommended to the population, mostly those living in areas of high risk, that they <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> not {{to leave their homes}} unless necessary and to find evacuation routes and temporary shelters. Both Manuel Márquez de León International Airport in La Paz and Los Cabos International Airport in San José del Cabo were shut down, stranding 7,500–8,500 tourists. Henriette also forced the ports in Los Cabos to close completely, and the port in La Paz to close to small craft.|$|E

25|$|With the {{repetition}} of responsibility to the desperation of the lower class, Plautus establishes himself firmly {{on the side of}} the average Roman citizen. While he makes no specific reference to the possible war with Greece or the previous war (that might be too dangerous), he does seem to push the message that the government <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of its own people before attempting any other military actions.|$|E
25|$|Leopold's {{maneuvers}} {{are intended}} to be performed by health care professionals, as they have received the training and instruction in how to perform them.

As with many large breeds, hip dysplasia, a painful and potentially debilitating condition, is not uncommon. Good genetics and proper nutrition as a puppy are key to avoiding these complications.|$|E

Turnagain Arm boasts the second highest tides in North America after the Bay of Fundy. These tides, which can reach 40 feet (12 meters), come in so quickly that they produce a wave known as a bore tide. Adventurous kayakers and surfers have taken to riding the tide as an extreme sport. Hikers <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> not to get stuck in the quicksand-like mudflats that otherwise make up the beaches along Turnagain Arm.|$|E
25|$|Secular Franciscans {{are called}} to be bearers of peace in their {{families}} and in society The renunciation {{of the use of}} violence, characteristic of the followers of Francis, does not mean the renunciation of action. Peace is the work of justice and the fruit of reconciliation and of fraternal love. While acknowledging both the personal and national right to self-defense, they should respect the choice of those who, because of conscientious objection, refuse to bear arms. However, the brothers and sisters <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> that their interventions are always inspired by Christian love.|$|E
25|$|In 1869, Governor Oden Bowie, of Maryland, {{requested}} that the state <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the Confederate dead from the battlefields of western Maryland.

Governor Bowie {{requested that}} Thomas Boullt of Hagerstown, Maryland, one of the Trustees for Maryland in the Antietam Cemetery, employ men to find and identify the Confederate dead buried in Washington and Frederick counties. Moses Poffinberger and Aaron Good of Sharpsburg identified ad hoc burial sites from throughout {{the western part of}} the state, primarily from the battlefields at Antietam, Monocacy and South Mountain, but also from skirmishes and from Robert E.

25|$|As for... {{the great}} {{question}} {{of the power of}} sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that {{it would be good for}} princes to be persuaded that their people have the right to resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of Grotius, that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext <b>should</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.|$|E

2500|$|In 1889, Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveichik had proclaimed early Zionist {{initiatives}} as {{resembling the}} 17th-century false messianic sect headed by Sabbatai Zevi.
