5|$|Chaplin {{soon found}} {{work with a}} new company, and went on tour with his brother – who was also {{pursuing}} an acting career – in a comedy sketch called Repairs. In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act Casey's Circus, where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon the <b>star</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> By the time the act finished touring in July 1907, the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer. He struggled to find more work, however, and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure.|$|E
5|$|Writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and {{producer}} Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{of the show}} TGS with Tracy Jordan have decided to rig the TGS auditions—in which they are {{in search of a}} new cast member on the show—by planning to add bad actors so that their preferred choice, Jayden Michael Tyler (Nick Fondulis), gets hired by their boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin). TGS cast member Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) learns that the auditions are taking place and worries that her position on the show will be lessened with the arrival of a new actor. Although Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the <b>star</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> reassures Jenna that the two have nothing to worry about, she remains uneasy. Later, Jenna discovers that Liz and Pete want Jayden to be cast, but she pleads with Liz to pull Jayden out of his audition. Jenna hates him for humiliating her after working together on a play, but Liz does not change her mind about Jayden. Jenna eventually figures out what Liz and Pete are scheming, so she and Tracy go out and find people (Angela Grovey and David Perlman) and bring them to the TGS auditions.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Peppard was offered, and accepted, {{the role}} of Blake Carrington in the TV series Dynasty. During the filming of the pilot episode, which also {{featured}} Linda Evans and Bo Hopkins, Peppard repeatedly clashed with the show's producers, Richard and Esther Shapiro; among other things, he felt that his role was too {{similar to that of}} J.

25|$|In 2000, {{after several}} years of {{performing}} stand-up comedy, Lopez was approached by actress Sandra Bullock for Lopez to produce and star in a comedy. Bullock was concerned about the lack of Hispanic-oriented sitcoms on American television and pushed to get a sitcom on television that starred Hispanics without being exclusively about the Hispanic American community. Long criticized by Hispanic American groups for lack of Latinos on their television shows, ABC quickly picked up the television series. In 2002, Lopez became one of the few Latinos to star in a television comedy series, {{following in the footsteps of}} Desi Arnaz, Freddie Prinze, and John Leguizamo. George Lopez is an American situation comedy that originally aired on ABC from 2002 to 2007. Lopez is the co-creator, writer, producer, and <b>star</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vivian Vance {{became a}} {{consideration}} {{on the recommendation}} of Lucy director Marc Daniels. Daniels had worked with Vance in New York on Broadway in the early 1940s. Vance had already been a successful stage star performing on Broadway for nearly 20 years in a variety of plays, and in addition, after relocating to Hollywood in the late 1940s, had two film roles to her credit. Nonetheless, by 1951, she was still a relatively unknown actress in Hollywood. Vance was performing in a revival of the play The Voice of the Turtle in La Jolla, California. Arnaz and Jess Oppenheimer went to see her in the play and hired her on the spot. Vance was reluctant about giving up her film and stage work for a television show, yet was convinced by Daniels {{that it would be a}} big break in her career. Ball, however, had many misgivings about hiring Vance, who was younger and far more attractive than the concept of Ethel as an older, somewhat homely woman. Ball was also a believer in the Hollywood adage at the time that there should be only one pretty woman on the set and Ball, being the <b>star</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> was it. Arnaz, however, was impressed by Vance's work and hired her. The decision was then made to dress Vance in frumpier clothing to tone down her attractiveness. Ball and Vance's relationship during the series' early beginnings were lukewarm at best. Eventually realizing that Vance was no threat and was very professional, Ball began to warm to her. In 1954, Vance would become the first actress to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Vance and Ball would develop a lifelong close friendship. Ball would go on to ask Vance to co-star in Ball's new series The Lucy Show after the end of I Love Lucy.|$|E

Chater said that Smith's role was [...] "superbly performed, as always", and Billen said that Smith offered [...] "tragic depth" [...] to her character. Wilson commended Smith's [...] "arresting performance", saying that [...] "No one does girl-next-door naturalism better – she has the actor's elixir of making {{you think you know}} her, just by a smile or an inflection."

500|$|Liz and her {{producer}} Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{meet with}} The Girlie Shows new network executive Jack Donaghy.

Jack asks Liz to hire Tracy Jordan, star of the film Honky Grandma Be Trippin, as part of the cast. Liz is skeptical as Tracy has a history of problematic behaviour, including running down Interstate 405 in his underwear while shouting [...] "I am a Jedi!" [...] and falling asleep on his neighbor's roof. In comparison to Liz, [...] Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), the narcissistic star of The Girlie Show, takes to Jack upon their first meeting.

In 1996, the magazine ranked it 11th on its list of the most innovative computer games.|$|E
500|$|The {{broadcast}} of the first episode brought positive comments for Irving and Meyer from television critics. Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail described Meyer as the series' [...] "only distinctive character", while Peter Paterson, also of the Daily Mail, deemed Meyer a welcome change to the caring, politically correct and compassionate characters seen in Casualty. In the Birmingham Post, Graham Keal called Irving's portrayal [...] "a charismatic combination of autocratic arrogance and dry wit", and noted that the character's interactions with Nick Jordan [...] "form the programme's primary double act". Andrew Billen in the New Statesman called Meyer the most compelling character of the series, while Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record similarly deemed Meyer the <b>star</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> writing that Irving: [...] "gave a chilling performance {{as a man who}} saves lives simply to boost his ego." [...] Following the {{broadcast of}} the second episode, Daily Mirror critic Charlie Catchpole wrote that Irving gave the best performance in a hospital drama as [...] "a rude, eccentric, conceited, arrogant bully" [...] since Tom Baker in Medics.|$|E

500|$|Sam Wollaston of The Guardian {{received}} the series positively, writing: [...] "Holby City has {{everything you want}} from a hospital drama: good–looking staff, a bit of love interest, a dishy doc, the odd current issue (no beds, badly–paid nurses) and bits {{where you have to}} look away", deeming it: [...] "Pretty good, really." [...] Stan Hey of The Mail on Sunday observed that on the strength of the opening episode, the series' success seemed [...] "fairly assured". He noted that: [...] "characters are only skin–deep as yet, being subsidiary to the plot, but a successful graft should be achieved during the series." [...] Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record praised the casting of French and Griffin, writing: [...] "It will take a couple of episodes before both actors shake off their soapy history, but with some decent plots and good lines, they should make the grade." [...] Morgan deemed Irving the <b>star</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> and commented: [...] "With Irving in the driving seat, Holby City looks like it is on the right track." ...|$|E
500|$|Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post {{enjoyed the}} episode, but observed: [...] "every time they write {{a scene where}} Burt stands up for Kurt, it diminishes the impact.

[...] Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV felt that [...] "Theatricality" [...] was a [...] "pretty strong, albeit not perfect, episode", deeming O'Malley the <b>star</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> Batallones criticized the Rachel and Shelby storyline, however, suggesting that it was rushed {{and would have been}} better stretched out across the remainder of the season. Mary Hanrahan of Broadway World also felt that the Rachel and Shelby plot was rushed, calling it [...] "sloppily handled". She criticized the performance of [...] "Bad Romance", additionally noting that [...] "Poker Face" [...] did not work {{in the context of a}} mother–daughter duet. Hanrahan commented that she was tired of [...] "themed episodes" [...] of Glee, concluding that the episode: [...] "fails on a lot of levels, and has actually made the episodes preceding it look better as a result." [...] Kevin Coll of Fused Film criticized the selection of [...] "Poker Face", noting that it was well done, but badly matched with the scene and storyline.|$|E
500|$|The {{successful}} festival led to Beaty {{being invited}} to play as a principal actor in a Washington, D.C., Shakespearean production organized by Davis.

The May 7, 1884, production was played in Ford's Opera House to a full house of more than 1,100 people; among them was Frederick Douglass. There was some heckling during the play, primarily {{from some of the}} white attendees, however a reviewer from The Washington Post reported that [...] "the earnestness and intelligence of several of the leading performers were such as to command the respect of those most disposed to find cause for laughter in everything that was said or done". Washington newspapers praised the principal actors, but noted that the inexperience of some of the supporting cast was evident. Reviewers for African American newspapers were especially pleased to see such a production in an important venue like Ford's Theater. The New York Globe wrote of the performance [...] "hus leap by leap the colored man and woman encroach upon the ground so long held sacred by their white brother and sister".|$|E
