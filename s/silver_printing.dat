50|$|Argyrotype is an iron-based <b>silver</b> <b>printing</b> {{process that}} {{produces}} brown images on plain paper. It {{is an alternative}} process derived from the argentotype, kallitype, and Van Dyke processes of the 19th century, but has greater simplicity, improved image stability, and longer sensitizer shelf-life. It was developed by Mike Ware.|$|E
50|$|The gallery showcases {{artists of}} the {{international}} contemporary scene such as Laurent Chehere, famous for his surreal series of flying houses of Paris, and Shigeru Yoshida, known for minimalistic black-and-white works recalling Japanese landscape painting traditions, Wendy Paton, whose black-and-white lyrical night scenes result from unraveled mastery of film camera and method of gelatin <b>silver</b> <b>printing.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Ruka {{worked with}} Rolleiflex cameras up until 2004. She {{would put the}} Rolleiflex camera on a tripod, and {{photograph}} using natural light, waiting until the right light came. Anna Tellgren states that Inta Ruka works with gelatin <b>silver</b> <b>printing</b> paper. This shows her connection to an older generation. Ruka had followed the path of portrait photography and also improved it. According to Tellgren (2017), Inta Ruka described the way she worked as documentary. When working on her own projects, she was self-employed.|$|E
50|$|During {{and after}} his 19-year tenure as Evans’s executor, Hill created many {{exhibitions}} of gelatin silver prints made from Evans’s negatives. Within the last ten years, Hill has used the digital techniques of scanning, file adjustment, and digital printing to interpret Evans’s images. These digital tools allow maintaining detailed information in both dark and light passages, in a manner not possible with gelatin <b>silver</b> <b>printing.</b> Hill has used these digital files to produce prints, exhibitions, and books that extend the appreciation of Evens’s intricate and multi-layered work. These exhibitions have been shown in museums and galleries in France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Korea, New York City, and numerous other American institutions.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a combined printing process utilizing inkjet printing of silver electrodes and solid-ink technology for printing hydrophobic wax barriers for fabricating paper microfluidic devices with integrated electrodes. Optimized printing parameters are given for achieving conducting silver {{lines on the}} top of macroporous chromatography paper down to 250 mu m- 300 mu m resolution. Electrical characterization and wicking experiments demonstrate that the printed silver patterns are simultaneously conductive and porous enough to allow reliable capillary wicking across the electrodes. The combined wax and <b>silver</b> <b>printing</b> method is used for fabrication of paper microfluidic isoelectric focusing devices for separation and concentration of proteins.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a silver-nanoparticle-based, screen-printed, high-performance, dual-band, bandstop filter (DBBSF) on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. Using screen-printing techniques to process a highly viscous <b>silver</b> <b>printing</b> ink, high-conductivity printed lines were implemented at a web transfer speed of 5 [*]m/min. Characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the printed lines were shown to be characterized by smooth surfaces with a {{root mean square roughness}} of 7. 986 [*]nm; a significantly higher thickness (12. 2 [*]μm) than the skin depth; and a high conductivity of 2 × 107 [*]S/m. These excellent printed line characteristics enabled the implementation of a high-selectivity DBBSF using shunt-connected uniform impedance resonators (UIRs). Additionally, the inductive loading effect of T-shaped stubs on the UIRs, which were analyzed using S-parameters based on lumped parameter calculations, was used to improve the return losses of the geometrically optimized DBBSF. The measured minimum return loss and maximum insertion loss of 28. 26 and 1. 58 [*]dB, respectively, at the central frequencies of 2. 56 and 5. 29 [*]GHz of a protocol screen-printed DBBSF demonstrated the excellent performance of the material and its significant potential for use in future cost-effective, flexible WiMax and WLAN applications...|$|E
