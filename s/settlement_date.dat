25|$|Unlike an option, {{both parties}} of a futures {{contract}} must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying {{asset to the}} buyer, or, {{if it is a}} cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the <b>settlement</b> <b>date,</b> the holder of a futures position can close out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and <b>settlement</b> <b>date.</b> The difference in futures prices is then a profit or loss.|$|E

25|$|Currency futures {{contracts}} are contracts specifying a standard volume {{of a particular}} currency to be exchanged on a specific <b>settlement</b> <b>date.</b> Thus the currency futures {{contracts are}} similar to forward contracts {{in terms of their}} obligation, but differ from forward contracts in the way they are traded. They are commonly used by MNCs to hedge their currency positions. In addition they are traded by speculators who hope to capitalize on their expectations of exchange rate movements.|$|E

25|$|Forwards do {{not have}} a standard. They may transact only on the <b>settlement</b> <b>date.</b> More typical would be for the parties to agree to true up, for example, every quarter. The fact that {{forwards}} are not margined daily means that, due to movements in the price of the underlying asset, a large differential can build up between the forward's delivery price and the settlement price, and in any event, an unrealized gain (loss) can build up.|$|E
25|$|On 1 August 2012, France {{introduced}} a financial transaction tax in French tax regulation pursuant to Article 5 of the French Amended Finance Bill of 14 March 2012. Two other taxes applicable to financial transactions were also introduced, including {{a tax on}} high-frequency trading, (Article 235 ter ZD bis of the FTC); and a tax on naked sovereign credit default swaps (Article 235 ter ZD ter of the FTC). The FTT levies a 0.2% tax on stock purchases of French publicly traded companies with a market value over €1 billion. The scheme does not include debt securities, except convertible and exchangeable bonds, which are included but benefit from a dedicated exemption to the FTT. According to French president Francois Hollande the tax will generate €170 million in additional revenue for 2012 and another €500 million in 2013. France is the first European country to impose a transaction tax on share purchases. From 2 January 2017 <b>settlement</b> <b>date</b> the rate increased to 0.3%.|$|E
2500|$|According to the SEC {{indictment}} against Annette Bongiorno and Joann Crupi, two {{back office}} workers {{who worked for}} Madoff, they created false trading reports based on the returns that Madoff ordered for each customer. For example, when Madoff determined a customer's return, one of the back office workers would enter a false trade report with a previous date and then enter a false closing trade in the amount required to produce the required profit, according to the indictment. Prosecutors allege that Bongiorno used a computer program specially designed to backdate trades and manipulate account statements. They quote her as writing to a manager in the early 1990s [...] "I need the ability to give any <b>settlement</b> <b>date</b> I want." [...] In some cases, returns were allegedly determined before the account was even opened.|$|E

2500|$|The declassified {{accident}} report, {{released in}} 2000, is available online, and {{indicates that the}} B-29 crashed because a fire started in an engine. [...] This document also reports that the plaintiffs received a settlement of $170,000. The <b>settlement</b> <b>date</b> was effective June 22, 1953, some {{three months after the}} Supreme Court ruling. In consideration for the money paid by the government, the case was dismissed with prejudice, meaning all future litigation on this case was forfeited. The radio program This American Life reported in 2009, that, contrary to claims made in the case, the accident report contained no information on the secret equipment on the plane except to note that secret equipment was present, a fact which had been reported in the press at the time. The program interviewed the daughter of one of the crash victims who described the government's claims in the case as fraudulent.|$|E
2500|$|Were investors able {{either to}} buy short naked (without {{borrowing}} money to pay), or sell short naked (without borrowing securities to deliver), such practices could easily lead to market manipulation of stock prices: since buyers or sellers {{would not have}} the restraint of providing cash or securities, they could conceivably have unlimited buys or sells, which would drive prices up or down. Naked short buying is not a problem because custodians and prime brokers have their own finances from which to lend money to their clients in order to settle the trades. Naked short selling can be a problem. It occurs when a prime broker is unable to borrow the stock simply because there is none available for that purpose. Hedge funds are expected to find sources of stock which can be borrowed before executing short sell orders. If they fail to do so, and their prime broker cannot borrow for them, then the settlement of such trades cannot take place on the <b>settlement</b> <b>date.</b> Whether such a [...] "fail" [...] is due to poor co-ordination among the various parties (hedge fund, lending entity and prime broker) or to a naked short sale is impossible to determine. In the US the SEC effectively ended such instances by making the cost of a failed short sell too expensive for the hedge fund to risk. If on the morning the short sell is scheduled to settle the prime broker cannot deliver the securities to the executing broker, then the latter is obligated to buy-in the shares (in effect, making the delivery). The buy-in occurs at the then prevailing market price. This may be much higher than the price at which the hedge fund first sold the securities, resulting in a potentially substantial loss to the hedge fund.|$|E
