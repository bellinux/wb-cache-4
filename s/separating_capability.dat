40|$|Rice panicles {{which have}} reached a mature state must be harvested, {{requiring}} differently specialized threshing devices and operating parameters to achieve favorable threshing and separating results. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to design a transverse multi-cylinders device that operates under the most effective possible variables to harvest rice in different states of maturity. The attachment forces between the grain and pedicel on the panicle were measured at different moisture contents. Based on rice agronomic characteristics, a transverse multi-cylinders device test bench was developed to conduct threshing and separating experiments. The threshing and <b>separating</b> <b>capability</b> of each transverse cylinder was tested, and the operating parameters of each threshing cylinder were investigated. Results showed that detachment force decreased from the bottom to the top of the rice panicle. Optimal harvesting time was identified at moisture content of 29. 69 %, and the best operating parameters combination was cylinder speed of 600, 650 and 700 rpm, and concave clearances of 40, 35 and 40 mm. Combine harvester of transverse multi-cylinder device test results showed an un-threshed grain ratio of 0. 64 %, un-separated grain ratio of 0. 35 %, and broken grain ratio of 0. 22 %, at a feeding rate of 6 kg/s. This research can be used in the future to successfully design transverse multi-cylinders device for small and medium-sized rice combine harvesters. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} properties of nanoparticles highly {{depend on the}} surface morphology of the particles, so precise measurements of a particle's morphology enable reliable characterizing of the nanoparticle's properties. Obtaining the measurements requires image analysis of electron microscopic pictures of nanoparticles. Today's labor-intensive image analysis of electron micrographs of nanoparticles is a significant bottleneck for efficient material characterization. The objective of this dissertation is to develop automated morphology analysis methods. Morphology analysis is comprised of three tasks: separate individual particles from an agglomerate of overlapping nano-objects (image segmentation); infer the particle's missing contours (shape inference); and ultimately, classify the particles by shape based on their complete contours (shape classification). Two approaches are proposed in this dissertation: the divide-and-conquer approach and the convex shape analysis approach. The divide-and-conquer approach solves each task separately, taking less than one minute to complete the required analysis, even for the largest-sized micrograph. However, its <b>separating</b> <b>capability</b> of particle overlaps is limited, meaning that {{it is able to}} split only touching particles. The convex shape analysis approach solves shape inference and classification simultaneously for better accuracy, but it requires more computation time, ten minutes for the biggest-sized electron micrograph. However, with a little sacrifice of time efficiency, the second approach achieves far superior separation than the divide-and-conquer approach, and it handles the chain-linked structure of particle overlaps well. The capabilities of the two proposed methods cannot be substituted by generic image processing and bio-imaging methods. This is due to the unique features that the electron microscopic pictures of nanoparticles have, including special particle overlap structures, and large number of particles to be processed. The application of the proposed methods to real electron microscopic pictures showed that the two proposed methods were more capable of extracting the morphology information than the state-of-the-art methods. When nanoparticles do not have many overlaps, the divide-and-conquer approach performed adequately. When nanoparticles have many overlaps, forming chain-linked clusters, the convex shape analysis approach performed much better than the state-of-the-art alternatives in bio-imaging. The author believes that the capabilities of the proposed methods expedite the morphology characterization process of nanoparticles. The author further conjectures that the technical generality of the proposed methods could even be a competent alternative to the current methods analyzing general overlapping convex-shaped objects other than nanoparticles...|$|E

Hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates {{in the form of}} cellulose and polystyrene resins were modified with chelating dyes by either covalent bonding or physical adsorption respectively. Large particle size polystyrene resins were used for preliminary investigations of dye loading and metal retaining capacities. After crushing resins to an intermediate particle size, capacity factors (k' values) and metal retaining capacities of four resins were determined. One resin, MN 200, was chosen for further investigations after crushing to a small particle size. A study of analytical separations and selectivities on the small particle size dye impregnated MN 200, for a range of dyes, was used to determine the suitability for analytical and preparative applications. The selectivity and separating ability of the unmodified resin was also investigated.

40|$|Abstract. The goal {{of blind}} source {{separation}} is to separate multiple signals from linear mixtures without extensive {{knowledge about the}} statistical properties of the unknown signals. The design of separation criteria that achieve accurate and robust source estimates within a simple adaptive algorithm {{is an important part}} of this task. The purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) We introduce the Huber M-estimator cost function as a contrast function for use within prewhitened blind source separation algorithms such as the well-known and popular FastICA algorithm of Hyvärinen and Oja. The resulting algorithm obtained from this cost is particularly simple to implement. We establish key properties regarding the local stability of the algorithm for general non-Gaussian source distributions, and its <b>separating</b> <b>capabilities</b> are shown through analysis to be largely insensitive to the cost function_s single threshold parameter. (2) We illustrate the use of the Huber M-estimator cost as a criterion within the winning algorithm entry for the blind source separation portion of the first Machine Learning for Signal Processing Workshop Data Analysis Competition, describing the key features of the algorithm design for successful separation of large-scale and ill-conditioned signal mixtures with reduced data set requirements. (3) We show how the FastICA algorithm can be implemented without significant additional memory resources by careful use of sequential processing strategies.

40|$|This study {{uses the}} {{absorptive}} capacity perspective and adds the firm 2 ̆ 7 s commitment {{to enhance the}} internationalization process of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It is proposed {{that each of the}} dimensions of absorptive capacity should be considered a <b>separate</b> <b>capability</b> that exists prior to internationalization and that enhances and reinforces the firm 2 ̆ 7 s ability to take advantage of its resources to advance international expansion and that internationalization has an effect on firm performance. Based on the absorptive capacity perspective, it is further proposed that an SME 2 ̆ 7 s organizational learning, which is gained from international expansion, will influence the relationship between internationalization and the firm 2 ̆ 7 s performance. The central theme of the proposed model is, therefore, that understanding the relationships among an SME 2 ̆ 7 s absorptive capacity, its abilities, and its commitments to internationalization can improve understanding of the relationship between internationalization and performance. The conceptual framework presented in this study indicates that the process of absorptive capacity which flows across SMEs is complex and it involves multiple levels of analysis. I argued that the moderating effect of absorptive capacity needs to be explicitly transferred to SMEs if it is to have a sustained effect on firm performance through internationalization. Adapting absorptive capacity perspective, my model derives key determinants that influence SMEs 2 ̆ 7 performance, through internationalization, and examines how absorptive capacity leads to the creation of internationalization of SMEs. The perspective advanced here describes how all four facets of absorptive capacity -acquiring, assimilating, transforming, and exploiting -are geared toward internationalization of SMEs and produced competitive advantage for SMEs...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT A simple {{analytical}} exercise {{has been}} performed {{to calculate the}} effects which pixel angular size has on {{the determination of the}} shower detector plane and consequently on the abiltiy to measure the depth of shower maximum. A table is presented which lists the maximum pixel size required to obtain an uncertainty of less than 15 gm=cm 2 in shower maximum. This is done for various zenith angles and for three possible shower detector plane fitting schemes. The accuracy with which a fluorescence detector can measure a shower's depth of maximum development (Xmax) depends on two nearly <b>separate</b> <b>capabilities.</b> The first is the ability to adequately determine the shower development shape {{in the presence of a}} significant background. The second is the ability to adequately determine the plane which contains the shower axis and the fluorescence detector itself. Using the methods outlined by Paul Sommers in the original design report it is found that the optimum pixel size based on minimizing cost and maximizing the deterimination of shower shape is so large that for short shower tracks (! 10 ffi) the detector can only find the shower detector plane (SDP) to a few degrees. The SDP is found from the pattern of hit pixels and their projection on the celestial sphere. The ability to adequaty determine the SDP is clearly related to the angular size of the pixels and the number hit. Uncertainty in the SDP means uncertainty in the zenith angle ` of the shower and a consequent uncertainty in the depth scale since the slant depth assigned to a given point along the shower goes as x = xvsec(`) 1. xv is the vertical depth of the observed shower point. It is important to note that the effect is negligible for vertical showers but becomes more significant for increasing zenith angles. In this note we'd like to find the maximum pixel size which will yield an uncertainty in Xmax of less than 15 gm=cm 2 for showers with ` ^ 60 ffi. In order to do so we must fin...|$|R
