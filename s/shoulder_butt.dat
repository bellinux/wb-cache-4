50|$|A {{shoulder}} strike (also {{referred to}} as a <b>shoulder</b> <b>butt)</b> is a strike with the anterior part of the shoulder. The shoulder strike can be used against the head of the opponent in close positions such as in a clinch or ground fighting, but is generally not considered to have knockout power. However, as used as a fulcrum for a joint hyperextention, such as an arm lock in classic jujitsu from stand-up or ground positions, can serve well to break said joint either when being the surface that an elbow is slammed upon or as a surface to balance out the break much as the thigh is for the juji-gatame in Judo.|$|E

Alternatively, pork <b>shoulder</b> (<b>butt</b> roast), or {{pork loin}} {{is used in}} many recipes. The high acid content of the marinade and the slow cooking time tenderizes the meat, allowing otherwise tough pieces of meat to be used. The Yucatecan recipes always employ the juice of Seville or bitter oranges for marinating. In areas where bitter oranges are not common, juice of sweet oranges combined with lemons, limes, or vinegar are employed to approximate {{the effect of the}} bitter orange on the meat. Another important ingredient in all pibil recipes is achiote (annatto), which gives the dish its characteristic color and adds to flavor.It is usually eaten with side dishes such as: corn tortillas, red pickled onion, refried black beans and habanero chilies. Traditionally, cochinita pibil was buried in a pit with a fire at the bottom to roast it.The origin of the word pibil is unclear as to whether it comes from the Mayan noun for roasting or the verb 'to roast' as these are the same word pib.|$|E

40|$|A {{microstructural}} {{investigation was}} performed on {{a new type of}} friction joining – stationary shoulder corner friction stir welding (SSCFSW). This technique involves welding at a 45 ° angle and using filler materials in order to produce rounded corner welds. The filler materials were later coated in copper to ascertain the flow behaviour of the material and to determine what happens to the interface between the vertical and horizontal columns being welded. A new phenomenon – the so called “blades” effect – demonstrated two clearly defined regions within the dynamically recrystallised zone (DRX) which had different chemical compositions from each other. 	The investigation focused on some of the most commonly used wrought aluminium alloys – 2 xxx, 5 xxx, 6 xxx, and 7 xxx series aluminium. These were selected to give a good comparison between heat treated and non-heat treated alloys. Different aluminium series were also cross welded (2 xxx to 7 xxx) in order to assess feasibility and material flow behaviour. The vast majority of welds were performed in the 6 xxx series material; these included the copper tracer samples and a stationary shoulder friction stir butt weld. 	The first type of analysis was hardness mapping and was initially applied to cross welded alloys AA 2014 -T 4 and AA 7075 -T 6. The hardness maps showed that there were sharp hardness transitions within the DRX. Further analysis with SEM/EDS revealed that the “blades” region - which demonstrated highest hardness within the DRX – was exclusively AA 7075 -T 6 and that the “non-blades” region was exclusively AA 2014 -T 4. Hardness maps were also performed on SSCFSW 6082 -T 6 and 5083 -O. As these were not cross welded materials they didn’t exhibit the same sharp transitions in hardness across the “blade” and “non-blade” regions. However, the hardness profiles did highlight the difference heat treated and non-heat treated alloys, as the 6 xxx series saw a drop of hardness across the DRX with some recovery, and the 5 xxx series material saw an increase in hardness across the DRX. Both AA 7075 -T 6 and AA 2014 -T 4 are heat treated alloys, so the intense thermo-mechanical process of FSW is expected to cause the hardening precipitates to coarsen and dissolve. Depending on the post weld cooling process the dissolved second phase precipitates may reprecipitate and cause the material to regain some of its hardness. The blade and non-blade regions in the cross welded alloys were segregated on the basis of alloys composition, i. e. the blade region was entirely AA 7075 and the non-blade region was entirely AA 2014. Thus the post weld cooling phase favoured reprecipitation in AA 7075 over AA 2014, hence the far higher hardness measurements found in the blade region. For alloys that weren’t cross welded, {{the difference between the two}} regions is negligible, indicating that blade and non-blade regions are a primarily a result of material flow. 	Further tests were carried out on 6082 -T 6 welds but using copper tracers either between the interfaces of the two aluminium plates to be welded or around the filler wires that would be incorporated into the SSCFSW. A visual inspection showed the distinct presence of the blade and non-blade regions and that copper had preferentially distributed itself into the blade regions. A SEM and EDS {{was performed on}} the blade and non-blade regions and confirmed that the blades were copper rich and the non-blades regions were copper free. The filler wires that were coated in copper also saw the copper distributed preferentially into the blade region, however, as the filler wires are only consumed the in the top half of the weld, no copper was found towards the base the weld. This indicated that while material is being segregated during welding it is not massively being dragged down. A copper tracer was also placed between the interface of two plates in a stationary shoulder FSW butt weld, and once again the copper preferentially segregated itself into the blade regions. This indicates that the main mechanism for the blade effect is the stationary shoulder and tool, not the angle of the weld. Crystallographic texture analysis was performed using EBSD for the DRX stretching from the advancing side to the retreating side of weld region. Both regions towards the base and top of the weld region were analysed for a single material SSCFSW of AA 6082 -T 6. The texture had a strong crystal orientation, and was dominated by simple shear torsion texture. The simple shear components of / and C were detected, but instead of a uniform distribution, alternating bands of the B and components, and trace amounts of the C components. For the stationary <b>shoulder</b> <b>butt</b> welds in AA 6082 -T 6 a similar pattern emerged, but with a much stronger detection of the C component, and more in a banded formation. For the other aluminium alloys tested, the prevalence of the crystal texture was also observed, along with the simple shear components of / and C, but the presence of banding was either faint or non-existent. There was no evidence of the blade effect occurring in terms of texture, as EBSD runs were performed across bands that contained both blade and non-blade regions. The blades effect appears to be primarily a result of material flow behaviour and not dynamic recrystallisation mechanisms. The DRX has a consistent grain size throughout, but certain materials during welding preferentially distribute themselves either into the ‘blade’ or ‘non-blade’ regions. This phenomenon is likely to be linked to the threading on the tool used for the SSCFSW process, and the lack of interference of the shoulder. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{basic problem}} confronting the swine breeder isobtaining an ideal animal [...] one that grows rapidly and consumes feed efficiently, giving a dressed carcass {{with a large}} {{percentage}} of lean and a minimum amount of fat. The ham, loin, pic-nic <b>shoulder,</b> and Boston <b>butt</b> comprise the four lean cuts of a pork carcass. Be-cause they are the most valuable cuts, they receive special attention. The depth of the fat on the pork carcass wields considerable influence on the wholesale cuts yielded by the carcass. Scott (1930) found that as the depth of the fat in-creased the lean and bony cuts decreased. The longer carcass feels the effect of the fat covering less. Hankins and Ellis (1934) found correlation of. 84 between the percentage fat in the total edible portion of the carcass and the average back fat in milli-meters. Dickerson, et al., (1943) found that external conformation was more apt to indicate a difference in fat thickness and length ofbone and muscle thickness. Consequently, they were less accurate in predicting cut out value.

40|$|Sliding {{shoulder}} {{friction stir welding}} (SSFSW) is {{an alternative}} joining technique to the conventional friction stir welding process. The welding mechanism comprises of a rotating probe and a non-rotating shoulder. The shoulder therefore does not contribute to any heat generation or plastic deformation. When welding thicker section material, the contribution of heat generation from the shoulder becomes less significant {{and most of the}} heat and plastic deformation must be generated by the tool probe. For this reason it was decided to develop the process for thick section AA 6082 -T 6. Due to the stationary (non-rotating) shoulder the weld track is smooth and there is no reduction in cross-sectional area. This research is based on the development of a sliding shoulder friction stir welding tool with the ability to create joints of up to 25 mm thick on aluminium alloy 6082 -T 6 plate as well as the associated process development. The sliding shoulder friction stir welding tool was designed, manufactured and tested by initially performing partial penetration welds with various size tool probes and then finally by performing a sliding <b>shoulder</b> friction stir <b>butt</b> weld on 25 mm thick plate. As welds were performed and more knowledge gained about the process, design modifications were made. These included varying the clearance between the tool probe and stationary shoulder; the profile of the shoulder which contributes to material flow during the process; and supporting the tool probe to prevent deflection when welding thicker sections at high forge forces. From the sliding shoulder friction stir welds performed, an understanding of material flow during the process was gained when analysing the macro-sections and exit holes of the welds. Typical process forces and torques associated with the process were measured to assist with future head unit and tool designs with regard to sliding shoulder friction stir welding...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine microbial spoilage of skins of Black Bengal goats at various stages and to assess the efficacy of modified curing processes of that skins, during the period of July to November 2006. A total number of six intact skins from Black Bengal goat of two years of age were obtained from markets located at Bangladesh Agricultural University Campus and Mymensingh town. After the usual traditional method of flaying these skins were properly washed prior to curing process. Raw or green skin samples without subjected to treatment process were used as control. Two categories of samples were prepared, one immediately after the completion of flaying, i. e. considered as zero hour of sampling and the other after twenty-four hours of storage at the ambient temperature. The rest of the samples were treated with different preparations of Neem oil, Tolcide (30 L), and Busan (40 L) and common salt and kept for various periods. From each of the differently treated skins, bacteriological samples were taken aseptically from the regions of <b>shoulder,</b> belly and <b>butt</b> each sampling weighing about 10 grams. The bacteriological analysis of the samples was performed by determining total viable count in order to find out the extent of contamination and varying bacterial load of the three different regions. Moreover, the isolation and identification of various bacteria contaminating the skin samples was done and the efficacy of curing agents to minimize bacterial load and the survivability of microbes were studied. The results showed that Staphylococci, E. coli, Bacillus, Pseudomonas etc bacteria were isolated from raw and cured skin samples and Tolcide (30 L) 0. 04 % and Busan (40 L) 0. 04 % and Neem oil 10 % and common salt 20 % were the best curing agents from microbial quality point of view...|$|R
40|$|The ethnic Asian {{market in}} Washington and Oregon {{constitutes}} a sizable niche market for fresh Canadian pork. Since California possesses {{a large population}} segment that originates from Asia, {{the characteristics of the}} ethnic Asian-origin market {{in the northern part of}} that State are also of interest since this may also be a potential niche market for Canadian pork. The objectives of the first part of this study are to evaluate the Asian ethnic markets for fresh pork in the United States Pacific Northwest and Vancouver. In the second part of the project the assessment of the market for fresh pork by Asian-origin consumers was extended to San Francisco. In this extension, a detailed assessment was also made of the product preferences for fresh pork by Asian-origin consumers in San Francisco and the behaviour patterns associated with store choices of these fresh pork consumers. Asian retailers and distributors in Vancouver, Seattle and Portland were surveyed by direct interview during November and December 1996. The survey applied semantic differential scaling questions, open-ended questions and a stated preference task, a conjoint methodology, to examine pork retailer's and distributor's perceptions of fresh pork produced in Western Canada and in the Midwest United States. Personal interviews with wholesalers and retailers were also applied in the San Francisco market survey which was conducted in 1998. Two consumer surveys were also conducted in San Francisco in 1998, directed at Asian-origin consumers of fresh pork. The structure of the market for fresh pork represented by retailers catering to Asian consumers in Vancouver differs from that in Seattle and Portland. The "Asian market" in Vancouver is dominated by many small shops that deal directly with packers. The small shops in Seattle and Portland deal with distributors and wholesalers. Distributors play a small role in Vancouver's retail market. Asian retailers in Seattle deal with a variety of suppliers, including both packers and distributors. In Portland, retailers catering to Asian consumers trade mainly with distributors and a local packer-wholesaler. In San Francisco, Asian stores and butcher shops prefer to obtain pork through smaller joggers, while American style supermarket retailers catering to the Asian consumers purchase pork directly from meat packing companies; fresh pork is sold in different ways in the different types of stores catering to Asian consumers that are found in these markets. The first survey found that Western Canadian pork enjoys an image of superior quality amongst retailers and distributors in Seattle's ethnic Asian market. Asian retailers in Portland are less familiar with Western Canadian pork and did not regard it as highly as did retailers in Seattle. However, distributors in Portland are more familiar with Western Canadian pork and consider it to be superior to Midwest United States pork in terms of overall quality, meat colour and fat trim. In both these markets, Western Canadian pork is generally considered to be expensive. These results are not statistically significant, however they are of economic relevance since most of the major players in the segment were interviewed. Little knowledge of Western Canadian pork was evidenced by retailers or consumers in this market segment in San Francisco. Western Canadian pork presently enjoys a reputation for superior quality amongst the retailers that specialize in sales to Asian consumers in Seattle and Portland. However it is also clear that many members of the trade lack information or experience with Canadian pork. Consequently, there is an opportunity for Canadian processors to maintain or increase market share through more education and promotion to this market segment. The 1998 survey of Asian-origin consumers of fresh pork in San Francisco focused on two aspects: preferences for fresh pork attributes and choice of store for fresh pork purchases. An intercept survey method was chosen to select and interview consumer respondents. Some 40 % of the 196 respondents to the store choice survey purchase most of their fresh pork from American style supermarkets, 33 % purchase mostly from small Asian stores, 24 % from large Asian stores, and the rest from butcher shops. The most popular cut of pork purchased by Asian consumers is loins, followed by pork <b>shoulders</b> and <b>butts,</b> then pork leg, bellies, hock, and offal. The analysis indicated that socio-economic and demographic factors, as well as store attributes, significantly affect Asian consumers' store and product choices. The analysis of the ranking of selected attributes of fresh pork by Asian-origin consumers in San Francisco, California showed that freshness is ranked as the most important attribute, followed by the attributes of the color of meat, lowness in fat, and the whiteness of fat. The attributes of price, freedom from chemicals, and being USDA labelled were also ranked to be of importance. The attributes of little or least importance were knowing that pork came from the US, customized pork cuts, the variety of pork cuts, packaged pork, vacuum packed pork and seasoned and prepared pork. Empirical results from an ordered probit model postulated to explain respondents' rankings of attributes indicate that particular demographic and socio-economic characteristics of Asian-origin consumers influenced the importance rankings for the pork attributes that were identified to be important. For example, Chinese origin consumers were appreciably more sensitive to pork price than were other Asian-origin groups. One facet of the findings is that marketing strategies should not treat Asian-origin consumers as a single homogenous niche group in marketing since there are identifiable sub-groups of these consumers with specific attitudes and preferences. The importance placed on different attributes by particular ethnic subgroups, and their different preferences for stores at which fresh pork is purchased, provides useful information on which to develop strategies to target market development activities at the Asian-origin ethnic subgroups.
