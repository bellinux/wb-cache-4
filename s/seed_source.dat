Dendrochronological analysis can illuminate differences among trees from different <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> in terms of absolute annual growth and sensitivity to external growth factors. We analyzed annual radial growth of 567 36 -year-old pitch pine (Pinus rigida Mill.) trees from 27 <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> to evaluate their performance in a New Jersey Pine Barrens provenance experiment. Unexpectedly, missing rings were prevalent in most trees, and some years- 1992, 1999, and 2006 -had a particularly high frequency of missing rings across the plantation. Trees from local <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> (< 55 km away from the plantation) had a significantly smaller percentage of missing rings from 1980 - 2009 (mean: 5. 0 %), relative to northernmost and southernmost sources (mean: 9. 3 % and 7. 9 %, respectively). Some years with a high frequency of missing rings coincide with outbreaks of defoliating insects or dry growing season conditions. The propensity for missing rings synchronized annual variations in growth across all trees and might have complicated the detection of potential differences in interannual variability among <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> Average ring width was significantly larger in <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> from both the southernmost and warmest origins compared to the northernmost and coldest <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> in most years.

40|$|Silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) is {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} United Kingdom for reforestation. However, recent evidence indicates that, under some circumstances, planted birch can suffer serious and repeated mortality of the apical leaders and branches, with consequent loss of apical dominance {{and the formation of}} a contorted stem. Plants from 37 <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> of silver birch from Scotland and northern England planted at two sites were compared for several characteristics related to hydraulic architecture, vulnerability to freeze–thaw cycle induced embolism and spring recovery from winter embolism during the period 2000 – 2002. Phenological rhythms were also monitored in late winter–early spring to document relationships between phenology and water relations parameters. Significant differences were found across <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> in stage of bud flushing for four dates in spring. Early flushing <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> differed by about 1 to 2 weeks from late-flushing <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> across the two sites. Wintertime xylem embolism in stems reached a peak of about 50 to 70 % loss of xylem hydraulic conductivity, depending on the size and position of the sample shoots in the canopy. Small apical shoots were significantly more embolized than large basal shoots. Development of winter embolism was coupled to the occurrence of frost events. As percent loss of hydraulic conductivity increased during the winter, wood relative water content declined. Embolism reversal occurred rapidly in spring at the time of development of positive root pressure. No significant differences in the degree of winter embolism in 2001 were found among the three <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> examined. The investigation was expanded in the winter–spring of 2002 to include 10 <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> across both sites. Significant differences were found in degree of winter embolism across sites, dates and <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> For each date, there was a significant relationship between flushing scores and wood relative water contents across the two sites and all <b>seed</b> <b>sources,</b> suggesting that differences in time of flushing across sites and <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> were likely caused by differences in the time of occurrence of root pressure, a necessary precondition to flushing...|$|R
40|$|With climate change, {{favorable}} {{growing conditions}} for tree species are shifting northwards and to higher altitudes. Therefore, local populations are becoming less adapted to their environment. Assisted migration {{is one of}} the proposed adaptive measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural populations and maintain forest productivity. It consists of moving genetic material to a territory where future climate conditions correspond to those of its current location. Eight white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> representing as many seed orchards were planted in 2013 at three forest sites simulating a south-north climatic gradient of 1. 7 °C in Québec, Canada. The objectives were to (1) evaluate the morpho-physiological responses of the different <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> and (2) determine the role of genetic adaptation and physiological plasticity on the observed variation in morpho-physiological traits. Various seedling characteristics were measured, notably height growth from nursery to the fourth year on plantation. Other traits such as biomass and carbon allocation, nutritional status, and various photosynthetic traits before bud break, were evaluated during the fourth growing season. No interaction between sites and <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> was observed for any traits, suggesting similar plasticity between <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> There was no change in the rank of <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> and sites between years for height growth. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was observed between the height from the nursery and that after 4 years in the plantation. Southern <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> showed the best height growth, while optimum growth was observed at the central site. Juvenile height growth seems to be a good indicator of the juvenile carbon sequestration and could serve as a selection criterion for the best genetics sources for carbon sequestration. Vector analysis showed no nitrogen deficiency 4 years after planting. Neither <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> nor planting sites had a significant effect on photosynthesis before bud break. The observed results during the establishment phase under different site conditions indicate that southern <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> may already benefit from assisted migration to cooler climatic conditions further north. While northern <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> are likely to benefit from anticipated local global warming, they would not match the growth performance of seedlings from southern sources...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 One {{hundred and}} four <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> from {{throughout}} the range of Douglas-fir (Pseudotecia menzieaii (Plirb.)

On average the <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> were polymorphic at 37 percent of the loci (range 5. 0 - 65. 0), with mean expected heterozygosity equal to. 141 (range. 021 -. 243). Of the total genie diversity (H 1 =. 182) observed in the species. about 75 percent resided within seed sources; 12 percent was due to dfferences among the two recognized varieties. coastal (var. menziesii) and interior (var. plauca,) Douglas-fir; and, 13 percent was distributed among <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> within varieties respectively. Cluster analysis based on Nei's unbiased genetic distances resulted in two groups of <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> corresponding to the two varieties with the interior variety additionally separated into northern and southern subgroups near 440 latitude. A major transition zone between the two varieties was found in central Oregon but not in other regions as revealed in earlier investigations. On averages <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> within the coastal variety and northern interior subgroup had higher levels of expected heterozygosity but genetic differentiation among <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> was small. Levels of expected heterozygosity were much smaller in the southern interior subgroups but <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> were highly differentiated.

In general genetic diversity decreased towards the periphery of the species range. Range-wide patterns of variation based on allozymes were quite similar to those observed in terpene studies of Douglas-fir. A major exception was that <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> from the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California had a high affinity with the coastal variety as revealed in this study but appeared to more closely aligned to the interior variety in a terpene study.

A modeling approach is designed and applied with the objective providing a robust solution, i. e., transferred <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> perform well across multiple climatic scenarios. The approach involves two steps. First, the focal point seed zone method is employed to predict seed deployment zones under multiple future climate scenarios. Next, a portfolio model is applied to minimize the risk of maladaptation of the transferred seed under multiple climatic scenarios. The method was applied using black spruce (Picea mariana) field data from 7 sites using 24 <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> from the Great Lakes area. The focal point seed zone method generated deployment zones for 24 <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> over three 30 -years periods under 12 predicted future climate scenarios.

The variety must also be able to thrive in the region where the tree farm that is purchasing the seedlings is located. Genetic variations within the species of conifers that are used for Christmas trees have produced individual varieties of trees that can thrive in certain climates where other varieties of the same species cannot. This same genetic variation can also produce trees that are aesthetically more pleasing than others. Knowledge of the <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> allows the nursery to provide trees that are suitable for their customer specific locations and needs as well as satisfy the desires of the end-purchaser who will take the tree home for Christmas.

This method uses the living cells of one tree to produce man-made seeds that will produce a clone of the original plant. [...] If the costs are reduced significantly, this could result in nearly perfect Christmas trees. However, this will create a monoculture crop which may be susceptible to a single pest or disease.|$|E
40|$|Summary We {{evaluated}} winter (January through March) carbon {{assimilation of}} red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) from three Vermont <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> grown {{in a common}} garden in northwestern Vermont. Although CO 2 exchange rates were generally low, net photosynthetic rates increased during two prolonged thaws. Significant correlations between CO 2 ex-change rates and multiday air temperature means supported our observations of enhanced gas exchange during extended peri-ods of elevated temperature. Increases in photosynthesis during thaws occurred before observed increases in leaf conductance, indicating that initial changes in photosynthesis were probably not associated with changes in stomatal aperture. Results of correlations between photosynthetic rates and PAR suggested that solar irradiance {{did not have a}} strong effect on winter carbon capture. Rates of net photosynthesis differed among <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> Trees from the Mt. Mansfield source had the highest average rates of photosynthesis and, at times, rates for individual trees from this source approximated those occurring during the growing season. Because <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> differed in photosyn-thetic rates but not in leaf conductance, we conclude that differences in winter photosynthesis among <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> were primarily attributable to factors other than changes in stomatal aperture...|$|R
