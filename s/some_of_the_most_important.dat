5|$|De Lucía {{was noted}} for his fast and fluent picados (fingerstyle runs).

These innovations saw him {{play a key role}} in the development of traditional flamenco and the evolution of new flamenco and Latin jazz fusion from the 1970s.

5|$|Operationally, German forces {{achieved}} major {{victories and}} occupied <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> economic {{areas of the}} Soviet Union, mainly in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and inflicted, as well as sustained, heavy casualties. Despite these Axis successes, the German offensive stalled in the Battle of Moscow and subsequently the Soviet winter counteroffensive pushed German troops back. The Red Army absorbed the Wehrmacht's strongest blows and forced the unprepared Germans into a war of attrition. The Wehrmacht would never again mount a simultaneous offensive along the entire strategic Soviet–Axis front. The failure of the operation drove Hitler to demand further operations of increasingly limited scope inside the Soviet Union, such as Case Blue in 1942 and Operation Citadel in 1943 — all of which eventually failed.|$|E

5|$|The {{documented}} {{history of}} music in Baltimore extends to the 1780s. Little {{is known about the}} cultural lives of the Native Americans who formerly lived along the Chesapeake Bay, prior to the founding of Baltimore. In the colonial era, opera and theatrical music were a major part of Baltimorean musical life, and Protestant churches were another important avenue for music performance and education. Baltimore rose to regional performance as an industrial and commercial center, and also become home to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> music publishing firms in colonial North America. In the 19th century, Baltimore grew greatly, and its documented music expanded to include an abundance of African American music, and the city's denizens {{played a crucial role in}} the development of gospel music and jazz. Musical institutions based in Baltimore, including the Peabody Institute and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, became fixtures in their respective fields, music education and Western classical music. Later in the 20th century, Baltimore produced notable acts in the fields of rock, R and hip hop.|$|E
5|$|While {{urban centres}} were rebuilt in local materials, {{including}} Aberdeen in granite and Glasgow in red sandstone, {{the homes of}} the rural poor remained basic, particularly in the Highlands. In the cities they were confined to the sprawl of suburban tenements like those of the Gorbals in Glasgow. One response to growing population was the creation of planned new towns, like those at Inverary and New Lanark. The nineteenth century also was the revival of the Scots Baronial style, pioneered at Walter Scott's Abbotsford House and confirmed in popularity by Queen Victoria's residence at Balmoral Castle. There was also a revival of Gothic styles in church architecture. Neo-classicism continued to be a major movement in the works of architects including William Henry Playfair and Alexander 'Greek' Thomson. The later part of the century also saw <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> architectural products of new engineering, including the iconic Forth Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Four British {{transports}} were considered: the Blackburn Beverley, Bristol 179B, Bristol 195 and Short PD 16/1. The mission also {{assessed the}} American Fairchild C-119G Flying Boxcar, Fairchild C-123 Provider and Lockheed C-130A Hercules. Of these types, the mission assessed that the Beverley, C-123 and C-130 could potentially meet the RAAF's requirements. Following further {{consideration of the}} options after their return to Australia, in early 1955 {{the members of the}} mission unanimously recommended that Hercules be procured, as the other two types did not meet <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> elements of the requirement. At this time the Australian Government was reluctant to fund any new equipment for the RAAF, and a decision to acquire twelve C-130s was not made until mid-1957. A contract for these aircraft was signed in October that year. The Australian C-130As were to be similar to those in service with the United States Air Force (USAF), the main difference being the use of TF56-A-11 engines in the place of the usual TF56-A-1 and TF56-A-9s; these engines provided almost the same power, but were modified to meet Australian fuel requirements. The total cost for the aircraft, initial crew training and support equipment was $US36 million (equivalent to about 16 million Australian pounds).|$|E

5|$|The {{participation}} {{of these two}} annual ceremonies are considered the least time-consuming part of the herald's roles. However at other times {{they are involved in}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> ceremonies concerning the life of the British monarch. After the death of a Sovereign the Accession Council (made up of Privy Councillors and other officers such as the Lord Mayor of London) meets at St. James's Palace to make a formal proclamation of the accession of the next Sovereign. The traditional method of publishing the council's proclamation recognising the new monarch is by way of it being physically read out. This task is assigned to the various members of the College by way of the Earl Marshal, who receives the text of the proclamation from the council in person. The proclamation is to be read at several locations in London. Traditionally the first reading is made from the Friary Court balcony at St James's Palace. Another reading and ceremony is held at the Temple Bar. There a detachment of heralds, accompanied by troops of the Royal Horse Guards, formally demand admission to the precinct of the City of London from the City Marshall and City remembrancer. The barrier, consisting of a silken rope (in place of the ancient bar) was then removed and the detachment would march forward to meet the Lord Mayor and City Sheriffs, where the proclamation would be read. Other readings by members of the College also occur at the corner of Chancery Lane, in Fleet Street, and at the Royal Exchange.|$|E
