40|$|Individuals tend to give losses {{approximately}} 2 -fold {{the weight}} {{that they give}} gains. Such approximations of loss aversion (LA) are almost always measured in the <b>stimulus</b> domain of <b>money,</b> rather than objects or pictures. Recent work on preference-based decision-making with a schedule-less keypress task (relative preference theory, RPT) has provided a mathematical formulation for LA {{similar to that in}} prospect theory (PT), but makes no parametric assumptions in the computation of LA, uses a variable tied to communication theory (i. e., the Shannon entropy or information), and works readily with non-monetary stimuli. We evaluated if these distinct frameworks described similar LA in healthy subjects, and found that LA during the anticipation phase of the PT-based task correlated significantly with LA related to the RPT-based task. Given the ease with which non-monetary stimuli can be used on the Internet, or in animal studies, these findings open an extensive range of applications for the study of loss aversion.

Forty-five heterosexual men completed the Sensitivity to Reward scale (from the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire) to measure BAS-related traits.

5000|$|Cerebellum - Recently, {{there has}} been a {{considerable}} amount of work that describes the role of the cerebellum in emotion as well as cognition, and a [...] "Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome" [...] has been described. Both neuroimaging studies as well as studies following pathological lesions in the cerebellum (such as a stroke) demonstrate that the cerebellum has a significant role in emotional regulation. Lesion studies have shown that cerebellar dysfunction can attenuate the experience of positive emotions. While these same studies do not show an attenuated response to frightening stimuli, the stimuli did not recruit structures that normally would be activated (such as the amygdala). Rather, alternative limbic structures were activated, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate gyrus, and the insula. This may indicate that evolutionary pressure resulted {{in the development of the}} cerebellum as a redundant fear-mediating circuit to enhance survival.

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple model of {{financial}} crises, {{which may be}} useful for the unified analysis of macro and financial policies implemented during the 2008 – 2009 financial crisis. A financial crisis is modeled as a disappearance of inside money due to the lemon problem à la Akerlof (1970), in a simplistic variant of Lucas and Stokey’s (1987) Cash-in-Advance economy, where both cash and capital stocks work as media of exchange. The exogenous emergence of huge amount of bad assets represents the occurrence of a financial crisis. Information asymmetry regarding the good assets (capital stocks) and the bad assets causes the good assets to cease functioning as inside money. The private agents have no proper incentive {{to dispose of the}} bad assets and the crisis could be persistent, because the lemon problem is an external diseconomy. Macroeconomic policy (e. g., fiscal <b>stimulus)</b> provides outside <b>money</b> for substitution, and financial stabilization (e. g., bad-asset purchases) restores the inside money by resolving information asymmetry. The welfare-improving effect of the macro policy may be nonexistent or temporary, while the bad-asset purchases may have a permanent effect to shift the economy out of the crisis equilibrium.

40|$|Background: Early {{dysfunction}} of {{the brain}} reward system in schizophrenia might be already recognized in the prodromal phase of this illness. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to assess the blood oxygen level-dependent response in the ventral striatum (VS) of subjects with ultra-high risk for psychosis during the presentation of reward-indicating and loss-indicating stimuli. Methods: Thirteen prodromal patients (mean age: 25. 5 ± 4. 6 years) and 13 age-matched healthy volunteers participated in an incentive monetary delay task, in which visual cues predicted that a rapid response to a subsequent target <b>stimulus</b> will gain <b>money,</b> avoid losing money or have no consequence. Results: Compared with the neutral condition, anticipation of reward loss-avoidance elicited significant activation of the VS in both healthy subjects and subjects with ultra-high risk for psychosis, but there was only a statistical tendency for less activation during loss-avoidance anticipation in prodromal compared to healthy subjects. Discussion: This study provides a first weak hint, as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging, for impaired activation of a central area of the mesolimbic dopaminergic brain reward system, the VS, already in subjects with ultra-high risk for psychosis, which is in line with results of patients with full-blown schizophrenic psychosis.

40|$|Attentional biases {{arising from}} {{classical}} conditioning processes {{may contribute to}} the maintenance of drug addictions and anxiety disorders. This thesis examined whether attentional mechanisms for conditioned stimuli (CS) would be dominated by affective properties (Lang, Greenwald, Bradley, & Hamm, 1993), or the uncertainty of the stimulus in predicting the outcome (Pearce & Hall, 1980). In chapter one affective and uncertainty-driven mechanisms of attention are discussed in relation to rewarding and aversive outcomes. In experimental chapter 2 methodological issues are addressed. In experimental chapters three and four attentional mechanisms are tested using a discriminative conditioning procedure with visual stimuli of varying predictive certainty (CS+,CS+/-,CS-) for a monetary or noise outcome (US). Attention was measured using an eye-tracker, and emotional conditioning and learning were measured using Likert scales. It was found that attention was mediated by uncertainty (chapter 3), but increasing the intensity of the outcome switched attention to affective-driven mechanisms for the noise outcome (chapter 4). In a further experiment this effect on attention remained for the noise outcome even under conditions promoting uncertainty-driven mechanisms (chapter 6). When cigarettes were the unconditioned <b>stimuli</b> instead of <b>money</b> in the appetitive conditioning, attention was also mediated by stimulus affect (chapter 5). In chapter 7 the data are discussed and it is concluded that when the outcome is highly emotionally salient, affective-driven mechanisms of attention dominate over uncertainty.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} number of neuroimaging studies using visual sexual stimuli (VSS) for human sexuality studies, including emerging field of research on compulsive sexual behaviors. A central question in this field is whether behaviors such as extensive pornography consumption share common brain mechanisms with widely studied substance and behavioral addictions. Depending on how VSS are conceptualized, different predictions can be formulated within the frameworks of Reinforcement Learning or Incentive Salience Theory, where a crucial distinction is made between conditioned (cue) and unconditioned (reward) stimuli (related to reward anticipation vs reward consumption, respectively). Surveying 40 recent human neuroimaging studies we show existing ambiguity about the conceptualization of VSS. Therefore, we feel {{that it is important to}} address the question of whether VSS should be considered as cues (conditioned stimuli) or rewards (unconditioned stimuli). Here we present our own perspective, which is that in most laboratory settings VSS play a role of reward (unconditioned stimuli), as evidenced by: 1.) experience of pleasure while watching VSS, possibly accompanied by genital reaction 2.) reward-related brain activity correlated with these pleasurable feelings in response to VSS, 3.) a willingness to exert effort to view VSS similarly as for other rewarding <b>stimuli</b> such as <b>money,</b> and/or 4.) conditioning for cues (CS) predictive for.

40|$|The {{current study}} used event-related {{potentials}} (ERPs) to investigate how motivational salience {{in the form}} of expectation violation influences spatial attention. The medial frontal negativity (MFN) ERP indexes expected value, being negative to unexpected punishments and positive to unexpected rewards. The P 1 and N 1 ERPs index spatial attention, being larger to stimuli in attended locations. This design attached motivational value to locations by making one visual hemifield economically rewarding (greater probability of a rewarding outcome) and the other punishing (greater probability of a punishing outcome). Keypresses to a dot probe following a reward-signifying <b>stimulus</b> were awarded <b>money</b> if correct, and penalized following a punishment-signifying stimulus if incorrect. We predicted that salience would be attached to visual hemifield, thus the MFN would be most negative to punishing outcomes in the rewarding hemifield and most positive to rewarding outcomes in the punishing hemifield. We also predicted that attention would be allocated to a location where expectation was violated, thus the P 1 and N 1 ERPs would be larger and RTs (reaction times) faster to dot probes appearing in the same side as an outcome that violated expected value. In a sample of 36 participants, there were no significant effects on the MFN, although the means were in the predicted direction, suggesting a lack of power. Contrary to our hypothesis, keypresses were slower, P 1 smaller, and N 1 larger to probes opposite the location where an expectation violation occurred. This suggested that expectation violation did not direct attention to a particular location, but produced general interference...|$|R
