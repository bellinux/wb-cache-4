In 1911, at age 29, and in the twilight of his All Blacks' career, he decided to <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> the professional sport of rugby league. Francis went on to represent New Zealand in rugby league, making him a dual-code international. It is unlikely his <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> rugby league was done without Gallaher's knowledge. Francis did eventually return to rugby union as a coach.|$|E
5|$|In the Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task (DCCS), {{children}} are initially asked to sort cards {{by a single}} dimension (such as color), and are subsequently required to alter their strategy to sort cards based on a second dimension (such as shape).

5|$|The {{original}} {{idea was to}} film the opening sequence in 1.33:1 aspect ratio in order to simulate the TV screens that were {{available at the time}} of the assassination, then transition to 1.85:1 when Garrison began his investigation, and finally <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> 2.35:1 for scenes occurring in 1968 and later. However, because of time constraints and logistics, Richardson was forced to abandon this approach.|$|E
5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|E
5|$|WMATA {{reached an}} {{agreement}} in 2013 with the sustainable lighting division at Philips Electronics North America to <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> LEDs at no upfront cost.
