5|$|Istanbul {{is home to}} Borsa Istanbul, {{the sole}} {{exchange}} entity of Turkey, which combined the former Istanbul <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange,</b> the Istanbul Gold Exchange, and the Derivatives Exchange of Turkey. The former Istanbul <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> was originally established as the Ottoman <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> in 1866. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Galata was the financial center of the Ottoman Empire, where the Ottoman <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> was located. Bankalar Caddesi continued to be Istanbul's main financial district until the 1990s, when most Turkish banks began moving their headquarters to the modern central business districts of Levent and Maslak. In 1995, the Istanbul <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> (now Borsa Istanbul) moved to its current building in the İstinye quarter of the Sarıyer district. A new central business district is also under construction in Ataşehir and will host the headquarters of various Turkish banks and financial institutions upon completion.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} what drives {{the decision of}} <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> to demutualize and going public, using a sample of 109 <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges.</b> We find that <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> that demutualize and go public are in countries that have {{a higher level of}} economic and political freedom, facing greater competition from their peers. Demutualized exchanges go public to raise capital and because countries have even more freedom of capital controls. The motivation of <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> to go publicly listed {{does not seem to be}} the same of “common companies”, we do not find evidence that larger, older and riskier <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> go public. <b>Stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> seem to demutualize to merge, which we interpret as an additional signal of competition. We also find evidence that <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> go public to make acquisitions and that they restructure internally before going public.

40|$|In this paper, the time-series {{dynamics}} of liquidity on the Scandinavian <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> between January 1993 and June 2005 are studied with liquidity indices. We observe that on all Scandinavian <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges,</b> liquidity has increased during the examined period. However, the monthly variation in liquidity is large. Moreover, within these order-driven <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges,</b> {{the relationship between}} the market variables return, volatility, trading activity,and liquidity is examined in a VAR framework. In line with previous findings on the U. S. stock markets, we find that an increase in return predicts higher liquidity, that there is a negative relationship between volatility and liquidity, and that a positive shock in trading activity predicts increasing liquidity. However, in comparison to previous studies on U. S. <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges,</b> our results indicate that liquidity is more dependent on trading activity in the Scandinavian order-driven markets. Finally, the linkage between these <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> in terms of liquidity is explored with VAR.
