By reducing {{the frequency of}} the calculation of the path planning, this method solved the problem that AUV can not respond to the frequent control instructions of path planning because of AUV’s poor flexibility.

40|$|Abstract—Large path {{losses of}} {{millimeter}} waves restrain {{the acceptance of}} 60 GHz technology in future networks. Directional antennas can be exploited in 60 GHz networks to mitigate the detrimental impact of fading. Employing fully directional antennas complicates the neighbor discovery process where each sector must be probed individually to discover neighbors located in that <b>sector.</b> In random <b>scanning</b> strategy, nodes select to-be-scanned sector randomly. In this letter, we analyze the minimum number of random <b>sector</b> <b>scanning</b> attempts during neighbor discovery process to have a non-isolated network. We present an analytical model to study the isolation probability defined as probability of having at least one isolated node in the network. Based on the isolation probability, we derive the minimum number of <b>sector</b> <b>scanning</b> attempts in a 60 GHz ad hoc network with arbitrary number of nodes. Although 60 GHz directional network is studied, this analysis is applicable to any directional wireless network.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{adaptive}} sensor control in dynamic resourceconstrained sensor networks. We focus on a meteorological sensing network comprising radars that can perform <b>sector</b> <b>scanning</b> rather than always scanning 360 ◦. We compare three <b>sector</b> <b>scanning</b> strategies. The sit-and-spin strategy always scans 360 ◦. The limited lookahead strategy additionally uses the expected environmental state K decision epochs in the future, as predicted from Kalman filters, in its decision-making. The full lookahead strategy uses all expected future states by casting the problem as a Markov decision process and using reinforcement learning to estimate the optimal scan strategy. We show that the main benefits of using a lookahead strategy are when there are multiple meteorological phenomena in the environment, and when the maximum radius of any phenomenon is sufficiently smaller than the radius of the radars. We also show that there is a trade-off between the average quality with which a phenomenon is scanned and the number of decision epochs before which a phenomenon is rescanned. ...|$|R

50|$|The Mk. IX {{allowed the}} {{scanning}} rate {{to be set}} at 8, 16 or 32 RPM. Additionally, the IX included the ability to perform a <b>sector</b> <b>scan,</b> limiting {{the movement of the}} scanner so instead of performing complete circles it scanned back and forth across a smaller angle. This provided much more rapid updates of the selected area, which was needed in order to account for the much higher speed of the aircraft. This was especially useful on the v-force, where the radar's location in the nose made it difficult to scan to the rear anyway, and at best some 60 to 90 degrees was always blocked.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{speckle pattern}} is random, any {{region of the}} {{myocardium}} has a unique speckle pattern: Within the picture, a defined area [...] "kernel" [...] can be defined, and as this speckle pattern is relatively stable, the kernel can be recognised in the next frame, within a larger search area, by a [...] "best match" [...] search algorithm. There are different search algorithms, {{the most commonly used}} is [...] "sum of absolute differences", shown to be similarly accurate as Cross-correlation, which is an alternative. The movement of the kernel across the image can thus be tracked, in principle independent of the beam angle, as opposed to tissue Doppler. Specle tracking can thus track in two dimensions. However, as the axial (in the direction of the beam) resolution of the ultrasound is far better than the transverse, the tracking ability is less in the transverse direction. Also, the transverse resolution (and hence, tracking ability) decreases with depth, in a <b>sector</b> <b>scan</b> were ultrasound beams diverge.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of airborne interferometric {{synthetic aperture radar}} is a relatively narrow swath compared to analogous space based systems. Increasing the swath with side view of the interferometer can be possible by increasing the flight altitude and angle of sight. At {{the same time the}} height measurement accuracy decreases due to slant range distance increase. Another possible way of swath increasing is using <b>sector</b> <b>scan.</b> The efficiency of <b>sector</b> <b>scan</b> using in interferometric synthetic aperture radar is analyzed in this paper.

The maximum accuracy decrease is obtained at the observation angle of 90 °. Despite height accuracy measurement decrease applying the <b>sector</b> <b>scan</b> allow to expand the swath.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the applicability of conventional 2 -D displacement and strain imaging techniques to phased array radiofrequency (RF) data. Furthermore, the possible advantages of aligning and stretching techniques for the reduction of decorrelation artefacts was examined. Data from both realistic simulations and phantoms were used in this study. Recently, the used processing concepts were successfully applied to linear array data. However, their applicability to <b>sector</b> <b>scan</b> data is not trivial because of the polar grid. Homogeneous and inhomogeneous tissue phantoms were simulated at a range of strains (0 to 5 %) using Field II((c)). The inhomogeneous phantom, a commonly used tumor/lesion model, was also constructed using gelatin/agar solutions. A coarse-to-fine displacement algorithm was applied, using aligning and stretching to enhance re-correlation. Vertical and horizontal strains were reconstructed from the axial and lateral displacements. Results revealed that the error on displacement estimates was lower when using 2 -D data windows rather than 1 -D windows. For regions at large depths and large insonification angles, the allowed lateral window size was limited. Still, 1 -D windows resulted in larger errors. The re-correlation techniques resulted in a significant increase in the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (SNRe) and elastographic contrast-to-noise ratio (CNRe) of the vertical and horizontal strain components. An increase of the SNRe of 5 - 20 dB was observed over a range of strains (0. 5 to 5. 0 %). In the inhomogeneous phantom, a vertical SNRe of 27. 7 dB and a horizontal SNRe of 16. 7 dB were measured in the background. The vertical and horizontal CNRe were 35 dB and 23. 1 dB, respectively. For the experimental data, lower SNRe (vertical: 19. 1 dB; horizontal: 11. 4 dB) and CNRe (vertical: 33. 3 dB; horizontal: 12. 5 dB) were found. In conclusion, 2 -D window matching of <b>sector</b> <b>scan</b> data is feasible and outperforms 1 -D window matching. Furthermore, the use of re-correlation techniques enhances both precision and contrast of strain images...|$|E

This scan format is primarily useful for cardiac imaging to avoid in-terference from the ribs. However, a real-time rectilinear volumetric scan with a wider field of view close to the transducer could prove more useful for abdominal, breast, or vascular imaging.

Consequently, a 94 X 94 Mills cross array in-cluding 372 active channels operating at 5 MHz has been developed on a flexible circuit interconnect.
