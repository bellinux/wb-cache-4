2500|$|In 55 BC, Lucretius, a Roman {{who carried}} on the ideas of earlier Greek atomists, wrote that [...] "The light & heat of the sun; these are {{composed}} of minute atoms which, when they are shoved off, lose no time in <b>shooting</b> <b>right</b> across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove."

No wonder that my nerves have gone! I saw a Russian correspondent, a strong brutal-looking man, go off into hysterics; I saw another run amuck through the camp, <b>shooting</b> <b>right</b> and left, and, finally, blow his own brains out. Many a night I sobbed myself to sleep. The men who live through tragedies, Aynesworth, age fast. I expect that I shall find Wingrave changed." ...|$|E

60|$|Presently, just as John {{in desperation}} was making {{up his mind}} to begin <b>shooting</b> <b>right</b> and left, and take his chance of cutting his way out, the saturnine Carolus, whose temper had never {{recovered}} the bowl of coffee, and who was besides very drunk, rushed forward with an oath and dealt a tremendous blow at him with the butt-end of his rifle. John dodged the blow, which fell upon {{the back of the}} chair and smashed it to bits, and in another second Carolus's gentle soul would have departed to a better sphere, had not the old frau, seeing that the game had gone beyond a joke, waddled down the room with marvellous activity and thrown herself between them.|$|E
60|$|Down {{the street}} went Calliope, <b>shooting</b> <b>right</b> and left. Glass fell like hail; dogs vamosed; {{chickens}} flew, squawking; feminine voices shrieked concernedly to youngsters at large. The din was perforated at intervals by the /staccato/ of the Terror's guns, and was drowned periodically by the brazen screech that Quicksand knew so well. The occasions of Calliope's low spirits were legal holidays in Quicksand. All {{along the main}} street in advance of his coming clerks were putting up shutters and closing doors. Business would languish for a space. The right of way was Calliope's, and as he advanced, observing the dearth of opposition and the few opportunities for distraction, his ennui perceptibly increased.|$|E

We heard the big looking-glass behind the bar knocked all to pieces and the bottles crashing. We could see Gotch-eared Mike in his apron running across the plaza like a coyote, with the bullets puffing up dust all around him. Then the gang went to work in the saloon, drinking what they wanted and smashing what they didn't.|$|E

60|$|The revenue vessel resumed her course {{towards the}} nighest port, worked by but four men: the captain, Israel, and two officers. The cabin-boy was kept at the helm. As the only {{foremast}} man, Israel {{was put to}} it pretty hard. Where there is but one man to three masters, woe betide that lonely slave. Besides, it was of itself severe work enough to manage the vessel thus short of hands. But to make matters still worse, the captain and his officers were ugly-tempered fellows. The one kicked, and the others cuffed Israel. Whereupon, not sugared with his recent experiences, and maddened by his present hap, Israel seeing himself alone at sea, with only three men, instead of a thousand, to contend against, plucked up a heart, knocked the captain into the lee scuppers, and in his fury was about tumbling the first-officer, a small wash of a fellow, plump overboard, when the captain, jumping to his feet, seized him by his long yellow hair, vowing he would slaughter him. Meanwhile the cutter flew foaming through the channel, as if in demoniac glee at this uproar on her imperilled deck. While the consternation was at its height, a dark body suddenly loomed at a moderate distance into view, <b>shooting</b> <b>right</b> athwart {{the stern of the}} cutter.
