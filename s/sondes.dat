5|$|In 1370 the French made a {{successful}} attack on Portsmouth, commencing a new sequence of raids along the English coast. In due course first Edward, then Richard II, responded by improving the defences {{in the south}} of England. Part of this involved improving the condition of Southampton Castle, where, owing in part to the theft of building materials, including stone and lead, by the citizens of the town, the defences were in a poor condition. Henry Yevele, who oversaw the improvements to the castle, probably also constructed the Arcades along the western walls in 1380: this involved adopting the 1360 proposal to block up the properties along the western quay to form a solid wall, and adding three towers and gunports. Sir John <b>Sondes</b> and John Polymond were appointed by the king in 1386 to further improve the town walls, working with Sir John Arundel, the castle governor – Polymond and Arundel Towers were probably named after these men around this time.|$|E
5|$|In situ measurements, in real-time, can {{be taken}} by sending {{specially}} equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone. In the Atlantic basin, these flights are regularly flown by United States government hurricane hunters. The aircraft used are WC-130 Hercules and WP-3D Orions, both four-engine turboprop cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements. The aircraft also launch GPS dropsondes inside the cyclone. These <b>sondes</b> measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface. A new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted Aerosonde, a small drone aircraft, was flown through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's Eastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The deep ice-sheet coring (DISC) drill {{consists}} of four major mechanical drilling subsystems and four subsystems supporting on-surface activities. The mechanical drilling subsystems are a drill <b>sonde,</b> a drill cable, a tower and a winch.

The drill cable not only provides the means of supporting the drill <b>sonde</b> in the borehole, but also provides conduits for electrical power and data transmission. The tower tilts to allow the drill <b>sonde</b> to be serviced in the horizontal position without removing it from the tower. The winch provides a means of quickly raising the <b>sonde</b> from the borehole and providing the fine control necessary for coring operations...|$|R

He said: [...] "As far as I am concerned, I should love to see the Sultan of Johore married to this most charming lady, Miss Lydia Hill." [...] He added that the Sultan could not marry at present because there was no mosque in Genoa where he was staying, because he could do nothing without the permission of the British Government, and because the Sultan was ill: [...] "He nearly died recently in Johore", having [...] "become ill with heart trouble and gout". The lawyer had been instructed to take his wife and daughter and accompany Cissie to Genoa, because she kept the Sultan [...] "cheered and tranquil". [...] She had performed an African dance for the Sultan, and accompanied him on a two-hour drive along the coast. Although the Sultan had previously announced an engagement in Malaya, the lawyer now said that he would inform the Press if and when any marriage were to occur. Such an engagement was not unique in east Kent in the 1930s.

In addition, <b>SONDe</b> is able to dynamically adapt the number of providers to reflect load variations experienced in localized portions of the system. Each node individually decides to be a provider, based on the observation of its h-hops neighborhood.

The <b>sonde</b> can be made without specialized tools or training and can be easily modified to meet individual application requirements. The platform allows for internal logging of multiple parameters of which conductivity, temperature, and GPS position are demonstrated. Two design configurations for different coastal hydrographic applications are highlighted to show the robust and versatile nature of this sensor platform. The initial <b>sonde</b> design was intended for use on a Lagrangian style surface drifter that recorded measurements of temperature; salinity; and position for a deployment duration of less than 24 h. Functional testing of the sensor consisted of a 55 h comparison with a regularly maintained water quality sensor (i. e., YSI 6600 <b>sonde)</b> in Mobile Bay, AL. The temperature and salinity data were highly correlated and had acceptable RMS errors of 0. 154 °C and 1. 35 psu for the environmental conditions. A second application using the <b>sonde</b> platform was designed for longer duration (~ 3 – 4 weeks); subsurface (1. 5 – 4. 0 m depths) deployment, moored to permanent structures. Design alterations reflected an emphasis on minimizing power consumption, which included the elimination of the GPS capabilities, increased battery capacity, and power-saving software modifications.
