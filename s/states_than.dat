5|$|Since the Confederacy was founded, {{among other}} things, on states' rights, one {{important}} factor in Davis's choice of cabinet members was representation from the various states.

This also led to complaints as more states joined the Confederacy, however, because there were more <b>states</b> <b>than</b> cabinet positions.|$|E

5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine.

5|$|MEPs in Parliament are {{organised}} into seven different parliamentary groups, including thirty non-attached members known as non-inscrits. The two largest groups are the European People's Party (EPP) and the Socialists & Democrats (S). These two groups {{have dominated the}} Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats between them. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament. As {{a result of being}} broad alliances of national parties, European group parties are very decentralised and hence {{have more in common with}} parties in federal states like Germany or the United <b>States</b> <b>than</b> unitary states like the majority of the EU states. Nevertheless, the European groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Convention {{agreed on}} several principles. Most importantly, {{they agreed that}} the Convention should go beyond its mandate merely to amend the Articles of Confederation, and instead should produce a new {{constitution}} outright. While some delegates thought this illegal, the Articles of Confederation were closer to a treaty between sovereign <b>states</b> <b>than</b> they were to a national constitution, so the genuine legal problems were limited. Another principle they agreed on was that the new government would have all {{the powers of the}} Confederation Congress, plus additional powers over the states. Once agreeing on these principles, the Convention voted on the Virginia plan and signaled their approval for it. Once this was done, they began modifying it.|$|E

Beebe was a well-known figure in the Roaring Twenties of New York City, and was friends with numerous other well-known figures of the period, including Fannie Hurst and the cartoonist Rube Goldberg. Although he was not physically handsome in the traditional sense, he tended to dominate every social and professional situation due to his enthusiasm, intelligence and charisma. As a result of his much-publicized divorce from Blair and his later marriage to Elswyth, he was also known for his stormy relationships with women.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between fluorine and bromine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Chlorine is a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine but a stronger one than bromine or iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). However, this trend is not shown in the bond energies because fluorine is singular due to its small size, low polarisability, and lack of low-lying d-orbitals available for bonding (which chlorine has). As another difference, chlorine has a significant chemistry in positive oxidation states while fluorine does not. Chlorination often leads to higher oxidation <b>states</b> <b>than</b> bromination or iodination but lower oxidation states to fluorination. Chlorine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Cl bonds.|$|E
5|$|Lepiota castaneidisca {{closely resembles}} L.cristata (with {{which it has}} {{commonly}} been confused), {{but it has a}} more rounded cap, lacks an umbo, and is reddish- or pinkish-brown, rather than orange-brown. L.cristata, which is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, prefers habitats where the natural vegetational cover has been disturbed by humans, or in the beds of rivers and creeks; in contrast, L.castaneidisca is found in natural, undisturbed habitats. Other similar species in similar habitats with which L.castaneidisca could be confused include L.thiersii and L.neophana; in contrast to L.castaneidisca, both of the latter two species have ellipsoid spores. The fruit bodies of L.thiersii appear from November through April, and grow scattered or in groups under cypress. It usually lacks the reddish color {{in the center of the}} cap associated with L.castaneidisca, and its spores are not as long, with dimensions of 4.7–6.3 by 3.1–3.9μm. L.neophana is a rare species, but more widely distributed in the United <b>States</b> <b>than</b> L.castaneidisca, as it has been reported from Ohio and Michigan in addition to California. It also fruits under cypress, usually between December and April. This mushroom is most readily distinguished from L.castaneidisca by the dark brown to blackish-brown color of the cap center.|$|E

This lead is even larger in the Japanese market, where it currently leads in total sales (having outsold both consoles by factors of 2:1 to 6:1 nearly every week from its launch to November 2007). In Australia the Wii broke the record set by the Xbox 360 and became the fastest-selling game console in Australian history, selling 32,901 units within the first four days of the console’s release. It also broke the 360’s Australian record for the quickest amount of time to sell 100,000 units, reaching the milestone within six months and two weeks.|$|E

5|$|The coinage metals were {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s1 electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p6s1; group 11: d10s1). However, the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties. This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals. Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia, as well as having more covalent character in their compounds. Finally, the alkali metals {{are at the top}} of the electrochemical series, whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom. The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation <b>states</b> <b>than</b> +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, thus giving the group 11 metals clear transition metal character. Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au−) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its 5d106s1 configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d106s2 configuration of mercury.|$|E
5|$|Though it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} of the halogens, iodine {{is still one of}} the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and sulfur dioxide to phosgene, nitrosyl chloride, and sulfuryl chloride respectively, iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation <b>states</b> <b>than</b> chlorination or bromination; for example, rhenium metal reacts with chlorine to form rhenium hexachloride, but with bromine it forms only rhenium pentabromide and iodine can achieve only rhenium tetraiodide. By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in iodine heptafluoride.|$|E
