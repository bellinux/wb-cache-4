As with all heat engines, their efficiency is limited, and governed by the laws of thermodynamics. Other types of power stations are subject to different efficiency limitations, most hydropower stations in the United States are about 90 percent efficient in converting the energy of falling water into electricity while the efficiency of a wind turbine is limited by Betz's law, to about 59.3%.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, {{a second}} French company, the Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama, {{was created to}} take over the project. A minimal {{workforce}} of a few thousand people was employed primarily to comply with the terms of the Colombian Panama Canal concession, to run the Panama Railroad, and to maintain the existing excavation and equipment in <b>salable</b> condition. The company sought a buyer for these assets, with an asking price of US$109,000,000. In the meanwhile they continued with enough activity to maintain their franchise. Phillipe Bunau-Varilla, the French manager of the New Panama Canal Company, eventually managed to persuade de Lesseps that a lock-and-lake canal was more realistic than a sea-level canal.|$|E
25|$|Greenleaf and Morris {{purchased}} 6,000 lots {{under the}} same conditions as the September agreement. At least 1,500 of these lots {{had to be in}} the northeast quadrant of the District of Columbia, but Greenleaf could take his pick of lots anywhere else in the city for the remainder. The monthly loan to the commissioners also increased, to $2,660 per commissioner per month. An additional clause required that the 6,000 lots include 428.5 lots on Buzzard Point owned by Notley Young (a plantation owner in Prince George's County, Maryland) and 220 lots on Buzzard Point owned by Daniel Carroll (a Founding Father and Maryland landowner whose farm was used to form the District of Columbia). The contract also included provisions (identical to those in the September 23 contract) which required no down payment; did not require the first payment until May 1, 1794; required only annual payments of one-sixth of the total amount of the purchase price annually thereafter; and did not impose any interest. With these transactions, Greenleaf and his co-investors now controlled about half the federal government's <b>salable</b> land in the District of Columbia.|$|E
500|$|The {{color of}} Naturalean {{composites}} or crossbred cattle can be solid black or solid red with black or reddish pigmentation {{in the same}} areas as the pigmentation on fullbloods. They may be horned or polled, and homozygous (2 copy), or heterozygous (1 copy). Fullbloods and Naturalean bulls are often crossed with traditional beef breeds like Black Angus or Hereford cattle because of substantial benefits in the crossbred results, including a higher protein meat that is lower in saturated fat, improved tenderness, and an approximate 7% yield increase in <b>salable</b> carcass. [...] Calving problems are also reduced in the crossbreds.|$|E
500|$|Geisel {{submitted}} his finished manuscript, originally titled A Story No One Can Beat, {{to dozens}} of publishers {{during the winter of}} 1936–37. Publishers posited a variety of criticisms of the book, including that fantasy was not <b>salable,</b> that children's books written in verse were out of style, and that the book lacked a clear moral message. According to the Morgans, Geisel angrily exclaimed to his wife, [...] "What's wrong with kids having fun reading without being preached at?" [...] She cited the book's cartoon-like drawings and its story, which might be seen to encourage daydreaming and lying to one's parents, as possible reasons for its rejection.|$|E
500|$|American novelist Henry James, {{one member}} of this {{literary}} elite, referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding as among [...] "the fine painters of life". But, James thought Austen an [...] "unconscious" [...] artist whom he described as [...] "instinctive and charming". In 1905, James responded frustratingly to {{what he described as}} [...] "a beguiled infatuation" [...] with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's [...] "intrinsic merit and interest". James attributed this rise principally to [...] "the stiff breeze of the [...] special bookselling [...] body of publishers, editors, illustrators, producers of the pleasant twaddle of magazines; who have found their 'dear,' our dear, everybody's dear, Jane so infinitely to their material purpose, so amenable to pretty reproduction in every variety of what is called tasteful, and in what seemingly proves to be <b>salable,</b> form." ...|$|E
500|$|The transcontinental {{railroad}} {{project was}} heavily subsidised by the government. The CPR was granted [...] of land {{along the route}} of the railroad, and $25,000,000 from the government. In addition, the government was pledged to build $32,000,000 of other railways to support the CPR. The entire project was extremely costly, especially for a nation with only 4.1million people in 1881. Between 1880 and 1885, as the railway was slowly built, the CPR repeatedly came close to financial ruin. Not only was the terrain in the Rocky Mountains difficult, the route north of Lake Superior proved treacherous, as tracks and engines sank into the muskeg. When Canadian guarantees of the CPR's bonds failed to make them <b>salable</b> in a declining economy, Macdonald obtained a loan to the corporation from the Treasury—the bill authorizing it passed the Senate just before the firm would have become insolvent.|$|E
500|$|Written in 1969 {{and later}} {{published}} in the Houseworker's Handbook, Betsy Warrior's Housework: Slavery or a Labor of Love and The Source of Leisure Time presents a cogent argument that the production and reproduction of domestic labor performed by women constitutes the foundation of all economic transactions and survival; although, unremunerated and {{not included in the}} GDP. According to Warrior: [...] "Economics, as it's presented today, lacks any basis in reality as it leaves out the very foundation of economic life. That foundation is built on women's labor; first her reproductive labor which produces every new laborer (and the first commodity, which is mother's milk and which sustains every new consumer/laborer); secondly, women's labor entails environmentally necessary cleaning, cooking to make raw materials consumable, negotiating to maintain social stability and nurturing, which prepares for market and maintains each laborer. This constitutes women's continuing industry enabling laborers to occupy every position in the work force. Without this fundamental labor and commodity there would be no economic activity nor we would have survived to continue to evolve." [...] Warrior also notes that the unacknowledged income of men from illegal activities like arms, drugs and human trafficking, political graft, religious emoluments and various other undisclosed activities provide a rich revenue stream to men, which further invalidates GDP figures. [...] Even in underground economies where women predominate numerically, like trafficking in humans, prostitution and domestic servitude, {{only a tiny fraction of}} the pimp's revenue filters down to the women and children he deploys. Usually the amount spent on them is merely for the maintenance of their lives and, in the case of those prostituted, some money may be spent on clothing and such accouterments as will make them more <b>salable</b> to the pimp's clients. For instance, focusing on just the U.S.A., according to a government sponsored report by the Urban Institute in 2014, [...] "A street prostitute in Dallas may make as little as $5 per sex act. But pimps can take in $33,000 a week in Atlanta, where the sex business brings in an estimated $290 million per year." [...] Warrior believes that only an inclusive, facts-based economic analysis will provide a reliable bases for future planning for environmental and reproductive/population needs.|$|E

[...] When the [...] valley had been denuded of its <b>salable</b> timber, and the St. Croix Boom closed on June 12, 1914, it had processed over 15.5 billion feet of logs. [...] Thanks to the quantity of timber, generous sorting fee enshrined in state law, and ability to scale labor efficiently, the St. Croix Boom was the most profitable in the entire Midwestern United States.|$|E
2500|$|While {{fracture}} filling as {{a method}} to enhance gems {{has been found in}} gems over 2,500 years old, the diamond's unique refractive index required a more advanced solution than simple wax and oil treatments. This technology became available roughly 20 years after the time the laser drilling technique was developed. Simply put, [...] "fracture filling" [...] makes tiny natural fractures inside diamonds less {{visible to the naked eye}} or even under magnification. Fractures are very common inside diamonds and are created during the diamond's creation in the earth's crust. As the rough diamond travels up from the earth's crust through volcanic pipes it comes under extreme stresses and pressures, and during this travel tiny fractures can form inside the diamond. If these fractures are visible and damaging to the beauty of the diamond, it will have much lower demand and won't be as <b>salable</b> to jewelers and the general public, making them candidates for fracture filling and thus visually improve the appearance of the diamond.|$|E
2500|$|The future {{state park}} was {{originally}} {{part of the}} reservation, but became tax-forfeit and was bought by whites. In the 1890s the Alger, Smith and Company began logging {{on both sides of}} the border. [...] In 1899 a series of sluices, dams, and flumes were built to float the logs safely around the waterfalls and gorges; remains of the wooden timber slide around the High Falls are still visible on the Canadian side. [...] The Pigeon River Lumber Company began operations in 1900 and within a few years the two companies had stripped the land of <b>salable</b> timber and moved away, leaving the area afflicted with unemployment, forest fires, and poor hunting. [...] In the early twentieth century a remote fishing resort was located within the future park. [...] In the 1930s plans were made to route Highway 61 across the Pigeon River at the High Falls, but conservation groups like the Izaak Walton League opposed the plan and the bridge and border crossing were ultimately built farther downstream in 1966.|$|E
2500|$|When the AP was founded, news {{became a}} <b>salable</b> commodity. The {{invention}} of the rotary press allowed the New York Tribune in the 1870s to print 18,000 papers per hour. During the Civil War and Spanish–American War, {{there was a new}} incentive to print vivid, on-the-spot reporting. Melville Stone, who had founded the Chicago Daily News in 1875, served as AP General Manager from 1893 to 1921. He embraced the standards of accuracy, impartiality, and integrity. The cooperative grew rapidly under the leadership of Kent Cooper (served 1925–48), who built up bureau staff in South America, Europe and (after World WarII), the Middle East. He introduced the [...] "telegraph typewriter" [...] or teletypewriter into newsrooms in 1914. In 1935, AP launched the Wirephoto network, which allowed transmission of news photographs over leased private telephone lines on the day they were taken. This gave AP a major advantage over other news media outlets. While the first network was only between New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, eventually AP had its network across the whole United States.|$|E
2500|$|The {{developers}} who followed Hitchcock's lead in Woodside were less flamboyant though similarly successful. [...] In 1863 John Mecke bought farmland from a family, the Moores, {{who had lived}} {{for more than a}} century and a half on what would become the northern part of what would become Woodside. He intended to subdivide, but became insolvent and, in 1867, died. [...] His heirs sold the property to two carpenters, Henry G. Schmidt and Emil Cuntz, who, in 1871, deeded their property to an organization known as the Bricklayers' Cooperative Building Association. [...] This organization seems not to have been what its name suggests since it was a New York corporation headed by Charles Merweg who gave his occupation as [...] "speculator in real estate." [...] In any event, the Association erected a housing development in north Woodside which it called Charlotteville. [...] The name was later given the more common spelling of Charlottesville. In 1886 another speculator, Effingham H. Nichols, divided property in the eastern part of the village and called it Woodside Heights. Other 19th-century developers included Charles F. Ehrhardt who sold lots in the northern part of the village and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company which converted two properties on the west side into <b>salable</b> lots.|$|E
2500|$|In 1768, Lieutenant John Cartwright, while {{following}} the Exploits River through the Exploits Valley, named the waterfall he found [...] "Grand Falls"; however, it took until 1905 before {{the town of}} Grand Falls was established. Worried about the impending war in Europe, Alfred Harmsworth (Baron Northcliffe) began looking for an alternative source of newsprint for his family's newspaper and publishing business. During their search for a suitable location to build and operate a pulp and paper mill, Harold Harmsworth and Mayson Beeton, son of Isabella Beeton, the author of Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, discovered Grand Falls. The site had great potential due to access to lumber, the possibility of hydroelectricity and a deep-water port available in nearby Botwood. On January 7, 1905, the Harmsworths and Robert Gillespie Reid, owner of the Newfoundland Railway, formed the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company, and the mill was constructed and opened on October 9, 1909. The first roll of <b>salable</b> newsprint was not produced until December 22, 1909. Workers came from throughout the colony and the world to help develop the new area. At that time, only employees of the mill and workers from private businesses were permitted to live in Grand Falls. Other people settled north of the railway in a shack town known as Grand Falls Station, which became Windsor, named for the English Royal Family.|$|E
2500|$|One {{prominent}} {{issue that}} feminist economists investigate {{is how the}} gross domestic product (GDP) does not adequately measure unpaid labor predominantly performed by women, such as housework, childcare, and eldercare. Feminist economists have also challenged and exposed the rhetorical approach of mainstream economics.

In the Houseworker's Handbook Betsy Warrior presents a cogent argument that the reproduction and domestic labor of women form the foundation of economic survival; although, unremunerated and not included in the GDP. According to Warrior: [...] "Economics, as it's presented today, lacks any basis in reality as it leaves out the very foundation of economic life.

The public funds, shares in joint-stock companies, and all descriptions of securities, are at a high price in proportion as the rate of interest is low.

Asking pardon publicly was easy compared to this; but then he began to discover that certain other things, invisible, but most valuable, were better property than knives, fish-hooks, or even money itself.

Then look out for woodchucks, if it is an exposed place, for they will nibble off the earliest tender leaves almost clean as they go; and again, when the young tendrils make their appearance, they have notice of it, and will shear them off with both buds and young pods, sitting erect like a squirrel. But above all harvest as early as possible, if you would escape frosts and have a fair and <b>salable</b> crop; you may save much loss by this means.|$|E
