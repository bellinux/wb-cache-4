30|$|This paper proposes an {{economic}} optimization method with two time scales for a {{hybrid energy system}} based on the virtual <b>storage</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a thermostatically controlled load (TCL). The optimization process includes two time scales {{in order to ensure}} accuracy and efficiency. Based on the forecast load and energy supply of the system, the first time scale is day-ahead economic operating optimization, carried out to determine the minimum operating cost for the whole day, and to find the period of greatest cost to which the second time scale optimization is applied. Using the virtual <b>storage</b> <b>characteristic,</b> the second time scale is short term detailed optimization carried out for these particular hours. By dispatching thermal load in this period and adjusting energy supply accordingly, we can find the optimal economic performance, and customer requests are taken into account to ensure satisfaction. A case study in Tianjin illustrates the effectiveness of this method and proves that a TCL can make a great contribution to improving the economic performance of a hybrid energy system.|$|R
