As an example, one knowledge loss shows that not all knowledge can be stored, and critical knowledge elements may therefore be lost when attempting to store it.

40|$|Jan Such, Iwona Sugalska – IN SEARCH OF MEANING As a {{rational}} and moral being, man lives in two worlds: {{a world of}} facts and a world of values. The latter one, an axiological dimension of human life, finds its expression in a search of meaning, i. e. {{the meaning of the}} existence {{of the world and the}} meaning of human existence. Such areas of symbolic culture as mythology, art, religion, philosophy and science also partici-pate in pointing out this meaning. The emergence and development of these areas is inevitably accompanied by the development of attitudes and moral views which play an important role in the process of assigning meaning to human life. Religion gives a deontological dimension to the meaning of life. The problem of how religious thoughts, experiences and feelings contribute to the meaning of life is complicated by the fact that apart from a revealed religion one can also distinguish a so called cosmic religion. Many prominent scholars claim that similar feelings are experienced by scientists who admire the harmony and secrets of the Universe. This very feeling of humility and admiration at the same time is called, after Einstein, a “cosmic religiosity”, which is “the strongest and noblest motive for scientific research”. Cosmic religiosity is, just as Einstein pointed out, a third stage of the development of religiosity (after the stage of a “religion of fear” and the stage of a “moral *social+ religion”) and has an elitist character because it is within reach almost only for scientists.

If in the past, the adult education was specific to academic environment, nowadays this educational term covers most social groups {{as a consequence of}} the ability of human beings to be educated. It can be said that the process of education occurs during the adult's life, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> their learning needs and in correspondence with the adult's psychological features. In the message Declaration of the First National Conference regarding adult education, Timisoara 2001, it's stated that “it is necessary to recognize adult education as a national priority, as part of the national education system” (Sava, 2001 : 194). An important role in adult education is played by the access to the latest information from the social, cultural and professional domains, as a premise for skills development at individual level but also macro-economical level, for the <b>society</b> progress <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Learning can be performed in specialized institutions through courses, training programs and/or e-learning platform which are completed by an official diploma certifying a particular professional qualification.
