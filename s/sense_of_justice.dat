5|$|Her {{most infamous}} antic was giving Ozy a haircut only to accidentally shave off all his fur. Although she is {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice,</b> facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what others think, and does what others, for fear of reaction from the people around them, would not dare. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.|$|E
5|$|Kyo is an overconfident but well-meaning person, more {{interested}} in enjoying life than taking on responsibilities. He is quick to dismiss subjects that do not interest him and will often carry out his actions with a devil-may-care attitude. He treasures his friends and family, enjoying their presence and particularly dotes on his girlfriend, Yuki. His strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> and zeal to fight stronger opponents are what he believes drives him {{to carry out his}} destiny. Kyo enters most of The King of Fighters tournaments representing the Japanese team along with teammates Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon. In his fights he uses the clan's martial art style, the , attacking opponents using flames along with several hits.

5|$|In {{the year}} 200X, robots {{developed}} to assist mankind are commonplace {{thanks to the}} efforts of renowned robot designer Dr. Light. However, one day these robots go out of control and start attacking the populace, among them six advanced humanoid robots made by Dr. Light for industrial purposes: Cut Man, Guts Man, Ice Man, Bomb Man, Fire Man, and Elec Man. He realizes the culprit is his old rival Dr. Wily (who plots to take over the world), but is unsure of what to do. His helper robot Rock, having a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice,</b> offers to be converted into a fighting robot to stop Dr. Wily's plan, becoming Mega Man. In time, he defeats the six robots and recovers their central cores, then confronts Dr. Wily within his Pacific-based robot factory (which happens to be mass-producing Light's robots). After a final showdown, Wily is defeated and Mega Man returns to his family.|$|E

Returning debts owed, and helping friends while harming enemies, are common <b>sense</b> definitions <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> that, Socrates shows, are inadequate in exceptional situations, and thus lack the rigidity demanded of a definition. Yet {{he does not}} completely reject them, for each expresses a common <b>sense</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> which Socrates will incorporate into {{his discussion of the}} just regime in books II through V.|$|R

25|$|Because {{the early}} system of {{connecting}} factors was mechanical and inflexible, the results could offend a court's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice.</b> For example, {{with the development}} of the motor car, the classification of the cause as tort required the application of the lex loci delicti commissi rule. In France, the Court of Cassation's insistence on the rule frequently barred or severely limited relief for French parties injured in states with no developed law for the compensation of such victims. The lower courts used a variety of judicial devices to avoid the injustice.|$|E

25|$|Paulus {{was convicted}} and given a 35-year sentence. Robinson claimed that Paulus had loved his {{daughter}} and that her actions were born out of a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> for avenging Robinson Hill's death. He continued to maintain his own innocence. Paulus subsequently appealed, and in October 1981, the Texas Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, ruling {{that there was not}} enough evidence to prove Paulus's guilt, and that McKittrick's evidence was unreliable. This decision was then overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in May 1982, reinstating the conviction and the original sentence. Paulus died of breast cancer at the Gatesville prison on May 16, 1986.|$|E
25|$|Fasting, {{which plays}} so {{essential}} {{a part in}} the practices of ascetics, classically found official recognition only {{in the development of the}} Day of Atonement. The Prophets, again, had little patience with fasting. There are some obscure allusions to fast days of popular observance, but the Prophets of exilic and postexilic days insist on the futility of this custom. Isaiah (lviii.), while appealing for a broader charity and deeper <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice,</b> maintains that these, and not fasting, are the expression of a will sanctified unto God. It is characteristic of the attitude of later Judaism that this very chapter has been assigned for the Hafṭarah for the Day of Atonement, the one penitential fast-day of the synagogue.|$|E
25|$|Ron Prosor, Israel's {{representative}} to the United Nations, claimed in General Assembly debate on the Question of Palestine, November 2014, that the UN is illogical and tends to lack of <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> {{when it comes to}} the case of Israel. He claimed that the UN's focus was solely on Israel, ignoring the thousands murdered and expelled in the Middle East under the tyranny of Radical Islam, and that the Arab–Israeli conflict was never was about the establishment of a Palestinian state but the existence of the Jewish state. He also claimed that the UN is not for peace or the Palestinian people but simply against Israel, and pointed out that if the UN really cared about the situation of the Palestinians, they would have taken at least one decision regarding the situation of the Palestinians in Syria and Lebanon, where Palestinians are being persecuted and systematically discriminated against.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is empirically {{investigated}} whether feelings of altruism towards {{members of other}} generations and <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> {{have an impact on}} the individual s evaluation of the public pension system. The data have been obtained from a large-scale survey carried out among a representative sample of the Dutch population in January 1994. The main topic of the questionnaire is the evaluation of changes in the pension system that have varying income effects for different generations. We find that young and middle-aged people indeed seem to be affected by feelings of altruism and fairness whereas the elderly appear to be non-altruistic. ...|$|R

25|$|The fact that, {{in little}} more than a month, Pope Clement V died in torment of a loathsome disease thought to be lupus, and that in eight months Philip IV of France, at the early age of forty-six, perished by an {{accident}} while hunting, necessarily gave rise to the legend that de Molay had cited them before the tribunal of God. Such stories were rife among the people, whose <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> had been scandalized by the whole affair. Even in distant Germany, Philip's death was spoken of as a retribution for his destruction of the Templars, and Clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his death-bed for three great crimes: the poisoning of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor, and the ruin of the Templars and Beguines. Within 14 years the throne passed rapidly through Philip's sons, who died relatively young, and without producing male heirs. By 1328, his male line was extinguished, and the throne had passed to the line of his brother, the House of Valois.|$|E
25|$|Chun-Li is {{presented}} as a woman with a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice,</b> and her motives for fighting crime range from avenging the death of her father (her desire to do so by revenge was the reason why she lost to a perfect victory in SFA2) to protecting innocents (she had finally learned to accept and deal with her losses). She especially cares for kids, showing repulse for the use of brainwashed young girls in Street Fighter Alpha 3 and the kidnap of a girl in Street Fighter III: Third Strike. In the latter game, she decides she will teach her fighting style and philosophy to kids. Chun-Li is an expert martial arts practitioner. She started training in several styles of Chinese kempo ("Chinese martial arts") at the age of 5, especially tai chi chuan, which she would later complement with sanda (combat wushu) and fighting styles from all around the world, such as taekwondo, Full contact karate, Judo and capoeira. Related to her police job, she is also a very skilled firearm user, her game profiles stating that she has at least once achieved a sixth place in an international shooting competition. Chun-Li has also been noted in-universe for her fluent English, investigating skills, penetrating eyes, beauty and acting talent for deception.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} game, the {{alternate}} Aquaman initially refuses to help Batman combat against Brainiac's forces as he doesn't {{want to get}} dragged into another surface world conflict, but Green Lantern does convince Arthur to lend some of his Atlantean forces to help after Atlantis starts to become invaded by Brainiac. Eventually, Atlantis and its people become captured by Brainiac, with Aquaman managing to escape before he is caught with them. He volunteers to assist Black Adam in using the Rock of Eternity to take out Brainiac's defenses, as his trident would act as a suitable conduit to direct the Rock's power. They arrive in Kahndaq and are attacked by Grodd, who fights the two kings alongside the brainwashed Green Arrow, Black Canary, and Blue Beetle. Aquaman kills Grodd to avenge the Atlanteans abducted by Brainiac before he and Black Adam successfully lower Brainiac's defenses. On Brainiac's ship, Arthur is pleased {{to find out that}} Superman managed to restore Atlantis from Brainac's ship. In Batman and Superman's conflict over whether to spare Brainiac, he sides with Superman as he believes leaving Brainiac alive would be too risky and is fine with killing his enemies as it matches Atlantis' old fashioned <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice.</b> He is defeated by Batman on the ship, as Batman puts Arthur out of commission by stabbing his leg with the Atlantean Trident. In his single player ending, Superman rises to power once again with Brainaic's death and Batman's defeat. Aquaman couldn't muster a force powerful enough to combat Superman to prevent the High Councilor from taking over Atlantis again. The Atlanteans discover a hidden Insurgency hideout underwater that contained Lex Luthor's interdimensional portal. After his scientists fix the portal, Aquaman uses it to travel to the primary universe from the first game to request their help in stopping Superman once again.|$|E
