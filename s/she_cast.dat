Seeking out a trade paper, {{he discovered that}} Metro had bought the film rights to the story. In New York, he sought out Metro's office, only to find June Mathis {{had been trying to}} find him. <b>She</b> <b>cast</b> him in the role of Julio Desnoyers. For the director, Mathis had chosen Rex Ingram, with whom Valentino did not get along, leading Mathis {{to play the role of}} peacekeeper between the two.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of Tilda Swinton, {{who was the first}} choice to play Jadis, the White Witch, casting was a long process. Beginning in 2002, Adamson went through 2500 audition tapes, met 1800 children and workshopped 400 before coming down to the final four actors for the Pevensies. Moseley and Popplewell came from the very start of casting, whilst Henley and Keynes were cast relatively late. Moseley was cast because casting director Pippa Hall remembered <b>she</b> <b>cast</b> him as an extra in a 1998 dramatization of Cider with Rosie. He quit school to learn all his lines and beat 3000 boys to the role of Peter.|$|E
25|$|In early August 2010, a {{group of}} nine experts, {{including}} former coroners {{and a professor of}} intensive-care medicine, {{wrote a letter to the}} British newspaper The Times questioning Lord Hutton's verdict. On 14 August 2010, , a retired pathologist, amplified the criticism, saying that a coroner would probably have recorded an open verdict in the absence of absolute proof that suicide was intended. <b>She</b> <b>cast</b> further doubt on the circumstances surrounding the death of Kelly, and also criticised Hutton's handling of the inquiry. She joined other experts questioning the official finding that Kelly had bled to death and argued that it was more likely that he had suffered a heart attack due to the stress he had been placed under. This intervention came as Michael Howard, the former Conservative Party leader, became the most prominent politician to call for a full inquest into Kelly's death.|$|E
500|$|In two stanzas of Völuspá, {{the war is}} recounted by a völva (who {{refers to}} herself here in the third person) while the god Óðinn {{questions}} her. In {{the first of the}} two stanzas, the völva says that she remembers the first war in the world, when Gullveig was stabbed with spears and then burnt three times in one of Óðinn's halls, yet that Gullveig was reborn three times. In the later stanza, the völva says that they called Gullveig Heiðr (meaning [...] "Bright One" [...] or potentially [...] "Gleaming" [...] or [...] "Honor") whenever she came to houses, that she was a wise völva, and that <b>she</b> <b>cast</b> spells. Heiðr performed seiðr where she could, did so in a trance, and was [...] "always the favorite of wicked women." ...|$|E

500|$|Evading Sir Timothy's ban on a biography, Mary Shelley often {{included}} in these editions her own annotations and reflections on her husband's life and work. [...] "I am {{to justify his}} ways," [...] she had declared in 1824; [...] "I am to make him beloved to all posterity." [...] It was this goal, argues Blumberg, that led her to present Percy's work {{to the public in}} the [...] "most popular form possible". To tailor his works for a Victorian audience, <b>she</b> <b>cast</b> Percy Shelley as a lyrical rather than a political poet. As Mary Favret writes, [...] "the disembodied Percy identifies the spirit of poetry itself". Mary glossed Percy's political radicalism as a form of sentimentalism, arguing that his republicanism arose from sympathy for those who were suffering. She inserted romantic anecdotes of his benevolence, domesticity, and love of the natural world. Portraying herself as Percy's [...] "practical muse", she also noted how she had suggested revisions as he wrote.|$|E
500|$|After {{directing}} the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association, Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), {{a love story}} between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina {{in her role as}} a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador. To ensure authenticity, <b>she</b> <b>cast</b> only actors from the former Yugoslavia—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what's onscreen." [...] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] <b>She</b> <b>cast</b> aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon {{reading the}} script, Kristin Kreuk noted {{that she had}} been [...] "entranced", believing that the main message that audiences would take away from the film was that of not judging an individual's {{personality}} based upon their physical appearances. Richardson thought that Caroline Thompson's adaptation was [...] "much more in keeping" [...] with the ethos of the Grimm tale than subsequent adaptations due to its [...] "darker" [...] nature. Praising Miranda Richardson as being perfect for the role of Elspeth, Caroline Thompson asserted {{that she had been}} [...] "a blast to work with." [...] Caroline Thompson noted that <b>she</b> <b>cast</b> the actors to play the dwarves according to their own individual personalities; she remarked that Warwick Davis was a [...] "phenomenal actor" [...] while Penny Blake was [...] "so funny" [...] and Michael J. Anderson was a [...] "genius." [...] Together, she thought that they brought an [...] "array of talents" [...] to the production. Michael J. Anderson himself claimed that he identified with his character, the [...] "philosopher of the group", and really enjoyed playing the role. Commenting on his character of Wednesday, Vincent Schiavelli noted that he was miserable because [...] "he really thinks that he's a dwarf" [...] even though he isn't.|$|E
2500|$|On December 8, Rankin was {{the only}} member of either house of Congress to vote against the {{declaration}} of war on Japan. [...] Hisses could be heard in the gallery as <b>she</b> <b>cast</b> the vote; several colleagues, including Rep. (later Senator) Everett Dirksen, asked her to change it to make the resolution unanimous—or at very least, to abstain—but she refused. [...] "As a woman I can't go to war," [...] she said, [...] "and I refuse to send anyone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a shuttle}} boat, the Andaste was {{commanded}} by Captain Albert L. Anderson of Sturgeon Bay. [...] A glacier-deposited mound {{of sand and}} gravel {{on the banks of}} the Grand River, at what is now the Bass River State Recreation Area twelve miles southeast of Grand Haven, yielded a steady stream of aggregate loads bound for Chicago. [...] On September 9, 1929, the Andaste lay alongside a Grand River dock, taking on another 2,000-ton load of Grand River aggregate. [...] Few noticed the workaday vessel, as she was a constant presence at working port quays like this one. [...] Late that evening <b>she</b> <b>cast</b> off and headed for Chicago. [...] The boat was logged by the Coast Guard as passing through the Grand Haven harbor piers at 9:03 p.m. [...] This brief notation in an official log book is the last verified sighting of the Andaste as a floating vessel.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{these few}} {{prolific}} plays, Damala was quickly forgotten or even deliberately {{ignored by the}} Parisian society, following his separation from the great diva. In March 1889, Bernhardt returned to Paris after a year-long European tour and receive a message from Damala who informed {{her that he was}} dying in Marseille and begged her to forgive him and take him back. The fact she had never stopped loving and caring for her husband was proved that very moment: she abandoned her performances in Paris, rushed to him and nursed Damala, whose health was wasted {{as a result of his}} longtime addiction. She took him in her house and after he recuperated, <b>she</b> <b>cast</b> him as her leading man in La Dame aux Camélias. Damala promised to stop taking morphine and embarked on a European tour with Bernhardt (which also included Egypt). In truth, Damala's addiction to drugs became progressively worse. He continued using the drug and occasionally ridiculed himself, his clarity severely reduced from the morphine. On one occasion, he almost got arrested for exhibiting himself naked in the Hotel de Ville in Milan. Damala reprised his role as Armand but after a six-week run he collapsed and was carried in the hospital. Shortly before his death, he was offered another role by Bernhardt, in the play Lena, at the Théâtre des Variêtés. [...] Just after the second performance, he was considered incapable of playing the part, due to his now permanent lack of clarity and continuous influence from alcohol and drugs.|$|E
