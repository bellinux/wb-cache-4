25|$|Würzburg C {{featured}} lobe {{switching to}} improve aiming accuracy. The C model was aimed by sending the <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> {{of one of}} two slightly off-centre feed horns {{in the middle of}} the antenna, the signal being switched rapidly between the two horns. Both returns were sent to an oscilloscope display, slightly delaying the signal from one of the horns. The result appeared as two closely separated blips which the operator attempted to keep at the same height on the display. This system offered much faster feedback on changes in target position, and changes in signal strength due to changes in reflection off the target affected both lobes equally, eliminating common reading errors. An almost identical system was used in the United States' first gun-laying radar, the SCR-268.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} Peter {{that he had}} sat there half the night, but really {{it was only a}} short time, before he heard a low <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> in the Black Shadows which covered the middle of the Big River. It was the voice of Honker. Then Peter saw little silvery lines moving on the water and {{presently}} a dozen great shapes appeared in the moonlight. Honker and his friends were swimming in. The long neck of each of those great birds was stretched to its full height, and Peter knew that each bird was listening for the slightest suspicious sound. Slowly they drew near, Honker in the lead. They were a picture of perfect caution. When they reached the sandy bar they remained quiet, looking and listening for some time. Then, sure that all was safe, Honker gave a low signal and at once a low gabbling began as the big birds relaxed their watchfulness and came out on the sandy bar, all save one. That one was the guard, and he remained with neck erect on watch. Some swam in among the rushes growing in the water very near to where Peter was sitting and began to feed. Others sat on the sandy bar and dressed their feathers. Honker himself came ashore close to where Peter was sitting.|$|E

50|$|The VIC-IIe has the little-known {{ability to}} create an {{additional}} set of colors by manipulating the registers in a specific way that puts the color <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> of phase with what {{other parts of the}} chip consider it to be in.|$|E
50|$|Near-field {{effects of}} an AM antenna may extend out two miles (3 km) or more. Cellular and {{microwave}} towers within this radius can reflect the AM <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> at a different frequency. This process results in interfering frequencies called reradiation.|$|E
50|$|This form of {{distortion}} mostly occurs due to electrical reactance. Here, all {{the components}} of the input signal are not amplified with the same phase shift, hence making some parts of the output <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> of phase {{with the rest of the}} output.|$|E
5000|$|Reviews for {{the film}} are mostly positive. Britmovie's review of the film <b>signals</b> <b>out</b> Steiger's {{performance}} {{as one of the}} film's highlights: [...] "Rod Steiger produces a gripping and highly charismatic performance as the conceited financier trapped in limbo with luck running out." ...|$|R
30|$|The current {{signals are}} {{obtained}} by 100 / 5 A current transformer. The CT secondaries {{are connected to}} shunt resistances to obtain an equivalent voltage signals. The low-level output voltage <b>signals</b> <b>out</b> from transformers are filtered and then are passed as an input to the data acquisition card.|$|R

50|$|A {{passband}} is {{the range}} of frequencies or wavelengths that can pass through a filter. For example, a radio receiver contains a bandpass filter to select {{the frequency of the}} desired radio <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> of all the radio waves picked up by its antenna. The passband of a receiver is {{the range of}} frequencies it can receive.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{numerous}} possible variations to this basic scheme. The Frequency Jump version, {{also known as}} the [...] "zebra method", inserts forcing only on a specific number of cycles in a set pattern. This dramatically reduces the chance that external circuits may filter the <b>signal</b> <b>out.</b> This advantage disappears with multiple inverters, unless some way of synchronizing the patterns is used.|$|E
50|$|The {{interface}} requires 18 <b>signals,</b> <b>out</b> {{of which}} only two (MDIO and MDC) {{can be shared}} among multiple PHYs. This presents a problem, especially for multiport devices; for example, an eight-port switch using MII would need 8 × 16 + 2 = 130 signals. For this reason, the reduced media independent interface was developed.|$|R

50|$|If a kick-in {{goes out}} of bounds without being touched by another player, the {{boundary}} umpire will <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> on the full and award a free kick to the opposition, {{whether or not the}} ball has bounced before going out. This is to prevent teams from getting their longest kicker to kick for touch. Kicking to oneself satisfies the kick-in condition, so any further kick taken will be treated normally.|$|E
5000|$|At age 15, Bombard {{experimented with}} {{broadcasting}} from his home, using a radio {{that had the}} wiring reversed to become a transmitter. The radio's antenna was hooked to a radiator, utilizing the water pipes to get the <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> to his neighborhood. In high school he partnered with Jody Carmen and Mel Cowznofski in the Big 50 [...] "Hits of the Week Survey, which was printed and distributed in Syracuse, NY to local record stores.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after Armstrong {{invented the}} superheterodyne, a triode mixer stage design was {{developed}} {{that not only}} mixed the incoming signal with the local oscillator, but the same valve doubled as the oscillator. This {{was known as the}} autodyne mixer. Early examples had difficulty oscillating across the frequency range because the oscillator feedback was via the first intermediate frequency transformer primary tuning capacitor, which was too small to give good feedback. Also keeping the oscillator <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> of the antenna circuit was difficult.|$|E

5000|$|Further {{improvements}} in the 1990s eliminated [...] "double-hop" [...] relays between two satellite-served communities, halving the transmission time for a satellite as much as 26000 mi away over the equator. Nevertheless, bad atmosphere conditions can still skip satellite <b>signals</b> <b>out</b> of the atmosphere for far-north points where the antenna points horizontally across the ground. (The effect is similar when looking at an oar in the water, and the oar appears bent.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The youths {{gathered}} up stones which they called [...] "Irish confetti" [...] and [...] "took {{aim at the}} red lenses, managing to put the <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> of commission," [...] an act they performed many times.

50|$|Special {{direct current}} filters {{are used to}} {{eliminate}} high frequency interference. Such filters are required if the transmission line will use power-line communication techniques for communication and control, or if the overhead line will run through populated areas. These filters can be passive LC filters or active filters, consisting of an amplifier coupled through transformers and protection capacitors, which gives a <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> of phase to the interference signal on the line, thereby cancelling it. Such a system was used on the Baltic Cable HVDC project.|$|E

50|$|On June 12, 2009, KCEB {{shut down}} its analog signal on channel 54, while KFXK ceased its analog signal on channel 51. KCEB then flash-cut its digital signal into {{operation}} on UHF channel 51 from the New London tower {{on a temporary}} 70 kW transmitter under special temporary authority from the FCC. At this point, KCEB was under severe financial hardship, and {{could not afford to}} build the digital <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> to its maximum authorization. On December 12, 2009, KCEB was issued a construction permit to install a 500 kW transmitter.|$|E
50|$|Insert jacks {{are often}} {{normalized}} so that signal is {{passed through the}} jack if nothing is inserted but is interrupted when the jack is holding a plug. Inserts with two separate jacks will have normalizing such that the Return jack interrupts signal but the Send jack doesn't. The Send jack can always {{be counted on to}} send <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> to external devices. A refinement of the normalization of jacks is the presence on the mixer of an insert ON/OFF button which allows the user to patch into or around the inserted devices at will without having to physically disconnect the insert cables.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an analog}} system, the signal is continuous, {{but in a}} PCM digital system, the {{amplitude}} of the <b>signal</b> <b>out</b> of the digital system is limited to one {{of a set of}} fixed values or numbers. This process is called quantization. Each coded value is a discrete step... if a signal is quantized without using dither, there will be quantization distortion related to the original input signal... In order to prevent this, the signal is [...] "dithered", a process that mathematically removes the harmonics or other highly undesirable distortions entirely, and that replaces it with a constant, fixed noise level.|$|E
