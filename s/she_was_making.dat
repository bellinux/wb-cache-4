5|$|Following {{several more}} troubled months, Jackson {{ended up in}} the hospital; he had {{collapsed}} while rehearsing for a concert in New York. Presley arrived to meet her ill husband, and yet another heated debate ensued. The argument ended after Jackson warned her that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> his heart rate go up and asked her to leave. She obliged, and was admonished by a doctor and Jackson's mother Katherine along the way. Presley subsequently returned to Los Angeles. Upon being discharged from hospital, Jackson went to Disneyland Paris to recover.|$|E

25|$|Like {{her sister}} ships Pennsylvania and Ohio, Illinois {{also had an}} eventful first year of operation. In April 1874, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> {{her way down the}} Delaware River when, just {{opposite}} the Philadelphia Naval Yard, she encountered four canal boats coming in the opposite direction. Illinois promptly collided with and sank all four vessels in short order. Fortunately, no lives were lost, and the hull of Illinois was undamaged by the collisions, enabling her to continue the voyage to Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|While {{from late}} 1787 {{up to his}} death in June 1789, Marie Antoinette's primary concern was the {{continued}} deterioration of {{the health of the}} Dauphin, who suffered from tuberculosis, she was directly involved in the exile of the Parlement, the May Edicts, and the announcement regarding the Estates General. She did participate in the King Council, the first queen to do this in over 175 years (since Marie de' Medici had been named Chef du Conseil du Roi, between 1614 and 1617), and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> the major decisions behind the scene and in the Royal Council.|$|E
25|$|In 660, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu toured Bian Prefecture (modern day Taiyuan), and Empress Wu had the {{opportunity}} to invite her old neighbors and relatives to a feast. Later that year, Emperor Gaozong began to suffer from an illness that carried the symptoms of painful headaches and loss of vision, generally thought to be hypertension-related, and he began to have Empress Wu make rulings on petitions made by officials. It was said that Empress Wu had quick reactions and understood both literature and history, and therefore, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> correct rulings. Thereafter, her authority rivalled Emperor Gaozong's.|$|E

25|$|When Marie Antoinette turned thirty, {{she decided}} {{it was no longer}} decent for her to dress in this way and {{returned}} to more acceptable courtly styles, though she still dressed her children {{in the style of the}} gaulle, which may have continued to reflect badly on the opinion of their mother even though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> visible efforts to rein in her own previous fashion excess. However, despite the distaste with the queen’s inappropriate fashions, and her own switch back to traditional dress later in life, the gaulle became a popular garment in both France and abroad. Despite its controversial beginnings, the simplicity of the style and material became the custom and had a great influence on the transition into the neoclassical styles of the late 1790s.|$|E
25|$|She {{could not}} perform La Dame aux Camélias on a London stage because of British {{censorship}} laws; instead, {{she put on}} four of her proven successes, including Hernani and Phédre, plus four new roles, including Adrienne Lecouvreur by Eugène Scribe and the drawing-room comedy Frou-frou by Meilhac-Halévy, {{both of which were}} highly successful on the London stage. In six of the eight plays in her repertoire, she died dramatically in the final act. When she returned to Paris from London, the Comédie Française asked her to come back, but she refused their offer, explaining that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> far more money on her own. Instead, she took her new company and new plays on tour to Brussels and Copenhagen, and then on a tour of French provincial cities.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of St. Peter's led to federal {{approval for a}} post office at the mission in 1885. After arriving in Montana, Mother Amadeus asked Bishop Brondel to give her control over the Ursulines, but he declined to do so. Amadeus repeatedly asked Mother Stanislaus, head of the Toledo chapterhouse (and who exercised authority over the Ursulines at St. Peter's), for more sisters {{to help with the}} work in Montana. Her requests were denied. She appealed to Richard Gilmour, Bishop of Cleveland, Ohio. When Mother Stanislaus complained, Mother Amadeus denied <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> an end-run around the chapterhouse, claiming instead that she was acting under instruction from Bishop Brondel. In February 1886, Bishop Gilmour ordered the Ursulines in Toledo to stop talking about how much they wished to teach in Montana, and ordered the St. Peter's Ursulines separated from the Toledo chapter.|$|E

25|$|Municipalities held by pro-'Yes' {{parties have}} {{also sought to}} limit the {{campaign}} events of 'No' voters by denying them rights to hold rallies in public spaces of community halls. Meral Akşener, a leading nationalist politician {{and one of the}} most prominent campaigners for a 'No' vote, was stopped from holding speeches when her campaign venues in Yalova and Edirne were abruptly shut down shortly before her events, with posters advertising her events in Eskişehir being ripped down. On 11 February while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> a speech at a hotel hall in Çanakkale, the venue suffered a power cut and was perceived by the pro-opposition media to be a symbol of the oppressive tactics against the 'No' campaign. After initially being obstructed by riot police, attendees at the conference used their phone lights to allow the event to continue.|$|E
25|$|Kitagawa {{was born}} on August 22, 1986 in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, and has a younger brother. She grew up in Kobe, and lost many friends in the Great Hanshin {{earthquake}} in 1995. As a child, {{she wanted to be}} a doctor, but by the time she reached high school she was uncertain as to whether she could do that, and not sure what to do in the future. At around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and she decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission, on two conditions: that she give up if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> no progress within a year, and that she put her studies first and graduate from university.

By the middle of October <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> fair copies for the press and correcting and transcribing Frankenstein for publication while Percy was working on The Revolt of Islam. Percy probably corrected and copyedited the journal section while Mary did the same for his letters. Advertisements for the work appeared on 30 October in the Morning Chronicle and on 1 November in The Times, promising a 6 November release. However, the work was not actually published until 12 and 13 November. It was Mary Shelley's first published work. (Frankenstein was not published until January 1818.) ...|$|E

One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity-related Twitter-like disclosures dates from 1980, when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round-the-clock press releases about his relationship with comedian Phyllis Diller, even revealing what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> him for dinner on a nightly basis. Conversely, Vancouver Sun columnist Steve Dotto opined that part of Twitter's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints, and Jonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that [...] "the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful." ...|$|E
