40|$|Asset {{securitisation}} {{represents an}} alternative risk management and refinancing method, which allows issues to convert classifiable cash flows from a diversified portfolio of pre-existing assets and receivables (liquidity transformation and asset diversification process) of varying maturity and quality (integration and differentiation process) into negotiable capital market paper, so-called "asset-backed securities" (ABS). Over {{the recent past}} ambivalence {{in the definition of}} capital adequacy for credit risk has particularly facilitated the development of loan securitisation as a refined "regulatory arbitrage tool". However, as impending regulatory change shifts the prime objective of securitisation to the efficient management of economic capital, procedural and substantive aspects of asset securitisation warrant closer inspection. The dissertation presents a comprehensive examination of the risk modelling, asset selection, optimal security design and competitive market pricing of asset-backed securities. We first provide an overview of the main characteristics of asset securitisation and explain its attendant benefits and drawbacks, especially as they pertain to the refinancing of illiquid asset exposures, such as SME-related payment obligations. Subsequently, we explain the gradual evolution of the regulatory treatment of asset securitisation adopted by the Basle Committee on banking Supervision {{in the wake of a}} general revision of the 1988 Basle Accord, which finally led to the adoption of the so-called Basle Securitisation Framework in 2004. We then present a single-factor, loss-based asset pricing model, which estimates the risk-neutral investment return of subordinated debt securities ("tranches") as leveraged contingent claims on a securitised reference portfolio of pooled credit exposures. We challenge common wisdom of robust statistics for the estimation of portfolio credit risk by adopting extreme value analysis, mainly because the leveraged exposure of <b>securitised</b> <b>debt</b> on fundamental asset value changes requires a better parametric specification of extreme quantiles to gauge unexpected loss. Based on the loss sharing between issuers and investors in a common security design, we examine how securitised asset exposure translates into investment risk of asset-backed securities. As a longitudinal extension to this valuation model, we also investigate the price dynamics of <b>securitised</b> <b>debt.</b> A multi-factor GARCH process is applied as an econometric specification of the heteroskedasticity of secondary market spreads of selected types of ABS transactions for valuation and forecasting purposes. In light of the substantial valuation uncertainty in securitisation markets, we conclude with a simple one-shot auction model, in which issuers maximise net payoffs from <b>securitised</b> <b>debt</b> under "winner's curse"-type underpricing as agency cost of adverse selection. In particular, we study how uninformed investment demand at varying degrees of valuation uncertainty affects the utility of endogenous price discovery by informed investors. Overall our synthesis of empirical and theoretical approaches yields instructive findings about important yet unexplored issues concerning the economic rationale of asset securitisation...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{commoditisation}} of {{illiquid asset}} exposures through securitisation facilitates the disciplining effect of capital markets on the risk management, private information about <b>securitised</b> <b>debt</b> {{as well as}} complex transaction structures could possibly impair the fair market valuation. In a simple issue design model without intermediaries we maximise issuer proceeds over a positive measure of issue quality, where a direct revelation mechanism (DRM) by profitable informed investors engages endogenous price discovery through auction-style allocation preference as a continuous function of perceived issue quality. We derive an optimal allocation schedule for maximum issuer payoffs under different pricing regimes if asymmetric information requires underpricing. In particular, we study how the incidence of uninformed investors at varying levels of valuation uncertainty and their function of clearing the market effects profitable informed investment. We find that the issuer optimises own payoffs at each valuation irrespective of the applicable pricing mechanism by awarding informed investors the lowest possible allocation (and attendant underpricing) that still guarantees profitable informed investment. Under uniform pricing {{the composition of the}} investor pool ensures that informed investors appropriate higher profit than uninformed types. Any reservation utility by issuers lowers the probability of information disclosure by informed investors and the scope of issuers to curtail profitable informed investment.

40|$|Commercial {{property}} {{is an important}} investment asset class that can cover the four quadrants of the Australian investment market – debt/equity and private/public markets. On available data, the extent and composition of property within these sectors can be measured and compared to the wider Australian investment market. As at December 2004, the estimated size of the overall Australian investment market is AU$ 5. 8 trillion of which Australian commercial property component represents AU$ 206 billion (4 %). Of this amount the private commercial property sector comprises just over 55 % and is distributed between debt AU$ 59 billion (28 %) and equity AU$ 57 billion (27 %) market. The publicly traded market (Listed Property Trusts) represents the largest component at AU$ 82 billion (40 %). In separating the equity, commercial property and <b>securitised</b> <b>debt</b> components, {{the size of the}} Australian investment market for these asset classes can be compared to the global equivalent. The total value of the global investment market is AU$ 122 trillion, and is apportioned equities (35 %), debt securities (61 %) and commercial property (4 %). The Australian market share is 2 % of the global investment market, although the percentages range across the different investment sub-markets. The Australian commercial property market accounts for 3 % of the global property market as there is a significant proportion of Australian investment grade property already owned by institutions...|$|E

40|$|We are in {{the midst}} of a global {{financial}} crisis accompanied by a deep and probably long-lasting economic downturn; indeed, some analysts are already calling this the first depression of the post-World War II era. In this article, I argue that this is a systemic crisis [...] a crisis of what Hyman Minsky called money manager capitalism. I link this to the analyses of Hilferding and Veblen of an earlier period, finance capitalism, and argue that this is, in effect, the second failure of this type of capitalism. The essential characteristics of early finance capitalism are: relatively small government, use of external finance for investment, and growing concentration of economic power in the hands of 'trusts' [...] or what we might today call megacorporations with varied interests and diverse affiliations across 'industry', 'finance' and 'insurance'. Unlike the first phase, the second phase of finance capitalism took place in the context of a big government, neoconservative model. Minsky's analysis helps us to understand how the New Deal and big government created a paternalistic capitalism after World War II, which favoured high consumption, high employment, greater equality and financial stability; however, that stability was destabilising because it permitted the rise of managed money. Over time, innovation and deregulation increased fragility, which generated increasingly frequent and severe financial crises. While previous crises were resolved quickly enough to prevent 'it' (another debt deflation) from happening again, this crisis appears to be sufficiently severe that the very survival of money manager capitalism is thrown into question. The article examines the contributing factors to the current crisis, including the real estate boom and bust, the rise of risky financial instruments such as <b>securitised</b> <b>debts</b> and credit default swaps, the commodities market bubble and the fiscal squeeze. The article concludes with some suggestions concerning the possible outcome of the failure of this form of finance capitalism. Copyright The Author 2009.

40|$|The {{process that}} so many people are envisaging for EU capital markets may be {{summarised}} approximately as follows: The single currency will eliminate currency risk. This will encourage a diversification by investors based upon other risk considerations. This will lead to a tremendous growth in capital markets. In turn this will stimulate the EU economy because of the well-documented link between financial development and economic growth. While not dismissing this logic, let me advance some doubts about the speed with which this may happen. Let us start by considering supply. Are we really going to see in Europe a large {{increase in the number of}} companies seeking access to markets either making initial public offerings (IPOs) or issuing <b>securitised</b> <b>debt?</b> Here we should distinguish between cross-border offerings by companies that are already listed somewhere, and previously unlisted companies. As shown by Colin Mayer's data for 1995 - 97, the former category, cross-border listings by already quoted companies, has been around for some years. Indeed, it is a phenomenon that is likely to diminish exactly because of EMU and the unification of financial markets. For example, the alliance between London and Frankfurt means that there will be a de-listing of German shares in London together with a de-listing of English shares in Frankfurt. However, this has very little effect on the overall size of the combined stock markets...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} question enquires if the timeshare market provides financial institutions {{with opportunities to}} adapt the timeshare market offering {{as an extension of}} their product range thereby growing the loan portfolio which it can hold as an income producing annuity or <b>securitise</b> this <b>debt</b> to realise profits. The timeshare market has grown substantially from modest beginnings in Europe in the early sixties to a world wide multi billion US dollar industry {{by the turn of the}} century. Despite a tarnished image and an industry associated with hard sell techniques, it continues to enjoy acceptance amongst consumers as a way of ensuring future holidays by fixing the cost, up front. The research showed that timeshare which is an entrenched concept is viewed as a consumer product and not as an investment. International literature highlights various risks associated with timeshare as well as the high cost of sales, high maintenance costs [levies] and exit costs. The literature is unanimous that if these costs could be reduced there would be more investment in timeshare thereby attracting a wider audience. The research also indicates that a business needs to conduct value chain analysis not only to look at its costs and performance in each value creating activity but also on ways to improve thereupon. Although the managing of core processes is vital to a company’s survival it also needs to scan the market environment to identify competitors. A company should have a competitive intelligence system that allows it to recognise the threat of new technologies and / or emerging products. Integration (backward or forward) is a grand strategy available to a business enabling a company greater control of the value / supply chain. The research report has tried to quantify the opportunities available to financial institutions to implement backward vertical integration in a market that they have steered clear from due to the “high risk” tag it carries. Due to the lack of up to date information the research report is mainly qualitative. It should be treated as a pilot study, highlighting what is of importance and which areas are to be treated with care when entering the timeshare market...|$|R
