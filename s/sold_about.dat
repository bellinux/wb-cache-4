Owing to limited demand for tickets, prices in the secondary market plunged.|$|E

5|$|Between 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UK's gold {{reserves}} shortly before gold entered a protracted bull market, since nicknamed by dealers as Brown Bottom.

The UK eventually <b>sold</b> <b>about</b> 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5billion. By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion, leading to Brown's decision to sell the gold being widely criticised.|$|E

5|$|Fan {{interest}} in attending games had begun declining throughout MLB in the late-1940s, and the Yankees faced a drop-off in their crowds after 1947, when they <b>sold</b> <b>about</b> 2.2 million tickets. By 1957, season attendance was down by over 700,000. New York baseball fans {{had the option}} of watching games on television instead by the early 1950s. The Yankees joined the other New York City franchises in allowing game telecasts. This was a departure from the team's strategy when radio broadcasts were introduced. Regular season games of the Yankees were not broadcast until 1939, as management believed that fewer fans would attend games if they could listen on radios.|$|E
