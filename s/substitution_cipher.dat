5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher</b> in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.|$|E

25|$|The Enigma was an {{electro-mechanical}} {{rotor machine}} {{used for the}} encryption and decryption of secret messages. It was developed in Germany in the 1920s. The repeated changes of the electrical pathway from the keyboard to the lampboard implemented a polyalphabetic <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher,</b> which turned plaintext into ciphertext and back again. The Enigma's scrambler contained rotors with 26 electrical contacts on each side, whose wiring diverted the current to a different position on the two sides. On depressing a key on the keyboard, an electric current flowed through an entry drum at the right-hand end of the scrambler, then through the set of rotors to a reflecting drum (or reflector) which turned it back through the rotors and entry drum, and out to cause one lamp on the lampboard to be illuminated.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel Bayesian approach for deciphering complex <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers.</b> Our method uses a decipherment model which combines information from letter n-gram language models {{as well as}} word dictionaries.

The new method can be applied on more complex <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> and we demonstrate its utility by cracking the famous Zodiac- 408 cipher in a fully automated fashion, which has never been done before. ...|$|R
25|$|The main {{classical}} cipher {{types are}} transposition ciphers, which rearrange {{the order of}} letters in a message (e.g., 'hello world' becomes 'ehlol owrdl' in a trivially simple rearrangement scheme), and substitution ciphers, which systematically replace letters or groups of letters with other letters or groups of letters (e.g., 'fly at once' becomes 'gmz bu podf' by replacing each letter with the one following it in the Latin alphabet). Simple versions of either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising opponents. An early <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher</b> was the Caesar cipher, in which each letter in the plaintext {{was replaced by a}} letter some fixed number of positions further down the alphabet. Suetonius reports that Julius Caesar used it with a shift of three to communicate with his generals. Atbash is an example of an early Hebrew cipher. The earliest known use of cryptography is some carved ciphertext on stone in Egypt (ca 1900 BCE), but this may have been done for the amusement of literate observers rather than as a way of concealing information.|$|E

40|$|<b>Substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> {{normally}} use prefix free codes ­ {{there is}} no code word which is the prefix of some other code word. Prefix free codes are used for encryption because it makes the decryption process easier at the receiver 2 ̆ 7 s end. In this project, we study the feasibility of <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> with non­prefix codes. The advantage of using non­prefix codes is that extracting statistical information is more difficult. However, the ciphertext is nontrivial to decrypt. We present a dynamic programming technique for decryption and verify that the plaintext can be recovered. This shows that <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> with non­prefix codes are feasible. Finally, we view the cipher from the attacker 2 ̆ 7 s perspective and experimentally study various attacks. We show that a limited attack is possible {{in the case of}} known plaintext. However, the ciphertext­only attack appears to be very challenging, which is in stark contrast to <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> with prefix free codes...|$|R
50|$|<b>Substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> as {{discussed}} above, especially the older pencil-and-paper hand ciphers, {{are no longer}} in serious use. However, the cryptographic concept of substitution carries on even today. From a sufficiently abstract perspective, modern bit-oriented block ciphers (e.g., DES, or AES) can be viewed as <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> on an enormously large binary alphabet. In addition, block ciphers often include smaller substitution tables called S-boxes. See also substitution-permutation network.|$|R

Certain keywords are not translated into Al Bhed in the game, to give the impression of use of loanwords compared to modern foreign languages. Most keywords are proper nouns, but some common nouns also are not translated, such as [...] "fiend" [...] (e.g. Y fiend! Eh risyh teckieca! [...] ).

"The Gold-Bug" [...] {{includes}} a cipher {{that uses a}} simple <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b> Though he did not invent [...] "secret writing" [...] or cryptography (he was probably inspired by an interest in Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe), Poe certainly popularized it during his time. To {{most people in the}} 19th century, cryptography was mysterious and those able to break the codes were considered gifted with nearly supernatural ability. Poe had drawn attention to it as a novelty over four months in the Philadelphia publication Alexander's Weekly Messenger in 1840. He had asked readers to submit their own substitution ciphers, boasting he could solve all of them with little effort. The challenge brought about, as Poe wrote, [...] "a very lively interest among the numerous readers of the journal. Letters poured in upon the editor {{from all parts of the}} country." [...] In July 1841, Poe published [...] "A Few Words on Secret Writing" [...] and, realizing the interest in the topic, wrote [...] "The Gold-Bug" [...] as one of the few pieces of literature to incorporate ciphers as part of the story. Poe's character Legrand's explanation of his ability to solve the cipher is [...] very like [...] Poe's explanation in [...] "A Few Words on Secret Writing".|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} solving <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> using a beam search approach. We present a conceptually {{consistent}} and easy to implement method that improves {{the current state of the}} art for decipherment of <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> and is able to use high order n-gram language models. We show experiments with 1 : 1 <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> in which the guaranteed optimal solution for 3 -gram language models has 38. 6 % decipherment error, while our approach achieves 4. 13 % decipherment error in a fraction of time by using a 6 -gram language model. We also apply our approach to the famous Zodiac- 408 cipher and obtain slightly better (and near to optimal) results than previously published. Unlike the previous state-of-the-art approach that uses additional word lists to evaluate possible decipherments, our approach only uses a letterbased 6 -gram language model. Furthermore we use our algorithm to solve large vocabulary <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> and improve the best published decipherment error rate based on the Gigaword corpus of 7. 8 % to 6. 0 % error rate. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> are {{codes in}} which each letter of the {{alphabet}} has one fixed substitute, and the word divisions do not change. In this paper the problem of breaking <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> is represented as a probabilistic labeling problem. Every code letter is assigned probabilities of representing plaintext letters. These probabilities are updated in parallel for all code letters, using joint letter probabilities. Iterating the updating scheme results in improved estimates that finally lead to breaking the cipher. The method is applied successfully to two examples...|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} encrypts {{pairs of}} letters (digraphs), and thus {{falls into a}} category of ciphers known as polygraphic <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers.</b> This adds significant strength to the encryption when compared with monographic <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> which operate on single characters. The use of digraphs makes the four-square technique less susceptible to frequency analysis attacks, as the analysis must be done on 676 possible digraphs rather than just 26 for monographic substitution. The frequency analysis of digraphs is possible, but considerably more difficult - and it generally requires a much larger ciphertext {{in order to be}} useful.|$|R
