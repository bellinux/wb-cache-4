5|$|The 1966 world {{championship}} season opened with the Monaco Grand Prix. Brabham {{was affected by}} a cold, and qualified poorly before retiring when the BT19's gearbox failed. Surtees led the race in his Ferrari before his differential failed on lap 15; the race was won by Jackie Stewart in a 2-litre BRM P261. At the following Belgian Grand Prix at the Spa circuit, Brabham survived an enormous 135miles per hour (215km/h) <b>slide</b> <b>in</b> the rain on the first lap. The shower eliminated half the field, including Stewart, who would miss the next race with his injuries. The BT19, using Goodyear tyres that were not suited to the conditions, came home fourth of five classified finishers. Surtees won the race for Ferrari, the last before he quit the Italian team.|$|E

25|$|Some trombones are tuned {{through a}} {{mechanism}} in the slide section rather than via a separate tuning <b>slide</b> <b>in</b> the bell section. This method preserves a smoother expansion {{from the start}} of the bell section to the bell flare. The tuning <b>slide</b> <b>in</b> the bell section requires two portions of cylindrical tubing in an otherwise conical part of the instrument, which affects the tone quality. Tuning the trombone enables it to play with other instruments which is essential for the trombone.|$|E

The accumulation of 8,000 m3/day of domestic garbage piled up, causes severe air pollution by local burning, the spread of disease, and water contamination. The provincial government has so far failed in its attempts to solve the garbage issue.|$|E

25|$|Rotary vane {{compressors}} {{consist of}} a rotor {{with a number of}} blades inserted in radial slots in the rotor. The rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape. As the rotor turns, blades <b>slide</b> <b>in</b> and out of the slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing. Thus, a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades. Rotary Vane compressors are, with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies.|$|E
25|$|When Lafayette Street {{was opened}} {{parallel}} to the Bowery in the 1820s, the Bowery Theatre was founded by rich families {{on the site of}} the Red Bull Tavern, which had been purchased by John Jacob Astor; it opened in 1826 and was the largest auditorium in North America at the time. Across the way the Bowery Amphitheatre was erected in 1833, specializing in the more populist entertainments of equestrian shows and circuses.
