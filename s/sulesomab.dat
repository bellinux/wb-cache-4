40|$|ABSTRACTTwenty-two {{patients}} with suspected brucellar spondylitis were investigated {{to evaluate the}} possible diagnostic role of <b>Sulesomab,</b> a 99 mTc-antigranulocyte antibody Fab' fragment. Sensitivity and specificity were {{compared with those of}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Skeletal involvement was detected by MRI in 11 cases, while leukoscintigraphy indicated normal vertebral uptake in seven of these patients, increased uptake in two patients, and decreased uptake in two patients. Leukoscintigraphy of the 11 patients negative by MRI demonstrated increased uptake in two cases. The sensitivity and specificity of leukoscintigraphy were 27. 2 % and 81. 1 %, respectively. Based on these results, leukoscintigraphy is not indicated for the management of {{patients with}} suspected brucellar spondylitis...|$|E
40|$|Abscess {{formation}} {{within a}} brain tumor is uncommon. Intrasellar or parasellar tumors {{are the most common}} neoplasms that develop such complications. Cerebral gliomas with abscesses are extremely rare. In this paper three rare cases of glioma associated with abscess formation are described. The diagnosis of brain tumor associated with abscess is particularly difficult by conventional neuroradiological studies. 99 mTc-labeled <b>sulesomab</b> can be useful in the diagnosis of brain tumors with intratumoral abscesses. There are no precise guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cerebral gliomas associated with abscesses formation for the low number of cases reported to date. Appropriate treatment, aimed at radical surgery, and a suitable antibiotic-protocol, deferring adjuvant postoperative therapy, is associated with a more favorable outcome. A review of the pertinent literature is also performed...|$|E

Historically, diagnosis has been achieved by histological examination, but, more recently, sophisticated molecular imaging techniques (including computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single photon emission CT, scintigraphy) that are increasingly used to support diagnoses made from histological data have been reported. For example, scintigraphy {{has been used to}} visualize the inflammatory process in vivo using either radiolabeled leukocytes or radiolabeled antigranulocyte monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Typically, radiolabeling is achieved using technetium- 99 m (radioactive half-life = 6. 02 hours), and the most commonly used MAbs are the Fab fragment of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody directed against the glycoprotein cross-reactive antigen- 90 (<b>sulesomab)</b> and an IgG antibody against normal cross-reactive antigen- 95 (BW 250 / 183, besilesomab [Scintimun&reg;]). The aim of the present review is to discuss use of this latter commercially available MAb, besilesomab, for imaging inflammation in adults with suspected osteomyelitis.
