40|$|Abstract: The LANDIS model simulates {{ecological}} dynamics, including forest succession, disturbance, {{seed dispersal}} and establishment, fire and wind disturbance, and their interactions. We describe the addition to LANDIS of capabilities to simulate forest vegetation management, including harvest. Stands (groups of cells) are prioritized for harvest {{using one of}} four ranking algorithms that use criteria related to forest management objectives. Cells within a <b>selected</b> <b>stand</b> are harvested according to the species and age cohort removal rules specified in a prescription. These flexible removal rules allow simulation {{of a wide range}} of prescriptions such as prescribed burning, thinning, single-tree selection, and clear-cutting. We present a case study of the application of LANDIS to a managed watershed in the Missouri (U. S. A.) Ozark Mountains to illustrate the utility of this approach to simulate succession as a response to forest management and other disturbance. The different cutting practices produced differences in species and size-class composition, average patch sizes (for patches defined by forest type or by size class), and amount of forest edge across the landscape. The capabilities of LANDIS provide a modeling tool to investigate questions of how timber management changes forest composition and spatial pattern, providing insight into ecological response to forest management. Résumé: Le modèle LANDIS simule des dynamiques écologiques telles que les successions forestières, la dispersion et l’établissement des semences, les perturbations causées par le feu et le vent, ainsi que leurs interactions.

The last sub-objective on the basis of these results, it was to optimize the regeneration process those shelterwoods. During a field investigations was natural regeneration detection on a total area of 35. 77 hectares, ie. 8. 47 % of the total area of forest groups in which natural regeneration occurs, and its potential is high.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{influence}} of <b>selected</b> <b>stand</b> characteristics of deciduous forest on the composition of nesting ornithocenosis. Especially {{the influence of}} the composition of forest stand age and structure and abundance of cavity trees. Using the point counting method, composition of nesting birds has been found on 50 census points located systematically in the stands of different ages and with different tree composition (mainly various presence of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and oak (Quercus spp.)). There were 1119 birds in total belonging to 38 species. It turned out that the presence of oak in vegetation affects the numbers of Finches, Great Spotted Woodpeckers, Blue Tits, Blackbirds, Golden Orioles, Cuckoos and Wood Pigeons. Presence of beech in forests affected some bird species with the opposite trend to the presence of oak in most cases. The number of species and individuals and diversity of bird communities at the census points increased with increasing presence of oak and decreased with the presence of beech. Stand age and spatial structure appeared to be an important factor in the occurrence of some bird species. The highest number of species has been recorded in the old stands. Cavity trees appeared primarily in old forests and {{had an impact on the}} presence of the Collared Flycatcher, Nuthatch, Chiffchaff and Willow Warbler. Generally, diversity and the number of species and individuals increased with the number of cavity trees. Nesting densities were calculated. Birds with the highest brood densities were Chaffinch, Great Tit, Nuthatch, Blue Tit, Chiffchaff and Great Spotted Woodpecker. Decreased abundance of ornithofauna during the nesting season has also been shown...|$|E
30|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in evaluating whether recent wildfires in dry conifer forests of western North America are burning with uncharacteristic severity—that is, with a severity outside the historical range of variability. In 2002, the Hayman Fire burned an unlogged 3400 ha dry conifer forest landscape in the Colorado Front Range, USA, {{that had been}} the subject of previous fire history and forest age structure research. We opportunistically leveraged pre-existing data from this research, in combination with post-fire aerial imagery, to provide insight into whether the Hayman Fire’s patterns of high-severity, stand-replacing fire effects were uncharacteristic. Living old overstory trees were well distributed and abundant in the landscape before the Hayman Fire, despite the fact that some stand-replacing burning had been a component of the landscape’s historical mixed-severity fire regime. Of 106 randomly <b>selected</b> <b>stand</b> polygons that were sampled for the age of the oldest living overstory tree prior to the fire, 30 % contained only trees ≤ 200 yr, while 70 % contained at least one tree > 200 yr and 29 % contained at least one tree > 400 yr. Following the Hayman Fire, only 5 % of the polygons contained any living trees; these polygons were all immediately adjacent to the reservoir {{in the center of the}} landscape. At most, 4 % of the polygons contained one or more trees > 200 yr post fire, and 3 % contained one or more trees > 400 yr. The nearly complete loss of old trees, most of which were located in areas with evidence of past non-stand-replacing burning, leads us to conclude that the amount and extent of stand-replacing burning within the Hayman Fire were uncharacteristic for this landscape over at least the last two to four centuries.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: In {{order to}} potentiate a valid {{comparison}} of forest stands, numerous indices {{were developed to}} express forest structure numerically. Each of those indices described a specific measured or calculated value. In the present study, three of the stand structure indicators, dependent on tree distance, were used: the aggregation index of Clark and Evans, the species mingling index and the diameter differentiation index. The objectives of this study were: to obtain further information about forest structure using the selected indices and to discover any limitations that the implemented indices might display. Materials and Methods: Mature pedunculate oak stands were selected as objects of the study, all located within the “Repaš – Gabajeva Greda” forest management unit, the Forest Administration of Koprivnica. The stands were aged 75 to 132 years. A systematic 500 m grid of 45 circle sample plots was established. The sample plot radius was 15, 25 or 30 meters, depending on the stand 2 ̆ 7 s age. In 2001, the DBH (diameter at breast height) and tree positions {{in regard to the}} centre of a plot were measured on each sample plot. The mutual distances between trees were calculated, as well as the values of the three <b>selected</b> <b>stand</b> structure indices. The two procedures of the aggregation index of Clark and Evans were calculated for all 45 sample plots. In the first case only the pedunculate oak trees were observed, and in the other all trees on the plot. The species mingling index and the diameter differentiation index were calculated for each tree in two procedures: in relation to three and four nearest neighbouring trees. The plot/stand totals were managed as the average index of individual trees. Results: Values of the aggregation index of Clark and Evans after all trees have been observed were from 0. 89 to 1. 28, which indicated a random distribution of trees. In case of considering only pedunculate oak trees, the index of the plots was 1. 02 to 1. 51. This indicated a tendency to a regular distribution of trees. The species mingling index that considered three nearest neighbouring trees was 0. 395 to 0. 620. When observing four nearest neighbouring trees, the index values showed slight decreases in all age classes. The diameter differentiation index (0. 407 - 0. 424) when three or four nearest neighbour trees were taken into account, showed almost the same differentiation in the 5 th, 6 th and 7 th age class. Conclusion: Though they contained the component of distance between the trees and were based on individual trees parameters, the three analysed stand structure indicators were a useful tool in further categorizing of forest stands...|$|E

We also tested if the calls of one species influenced the calling behaviour of the other. We detected a total of 34 Rufous-legged Owls and 21 Austral Pygmy Owls during the four seasons. Rufous-legged Owls were found principally in old growth Araucaria-Nothofagus stands (32. 4 %), and Pygmy Owls in old growth evergreen stands (52. 4 %). For both species there was a seasonal effect on call response, with a drop in responses in autumn and winter.
