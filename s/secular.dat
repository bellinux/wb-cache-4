5|$|Bach {{composed}} this cantata for Whit Tuesday, {{the third}} day of Pentecost. It was likely based on an earlier <b>secular</b> cantata for New Year's Day composed in Köthen (BWV 184a). The musicologist Szymon Paczkowski suggests two other possible occasions for the <b>secular</b> model: the birthday of Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Coethen on 10 December 1720, and the wedding of the prince and Friderica Henrietta on 11 December 1721.|$|E

5|$|Because Wells Cathedral was <b>secular</b> {{rather than}} monastic, cloisters {{were not a}} {{practical}} necessity. They were omitted from several other <b>secular</b> cathedrals but were built here and at Chichester. Explanations for their construction at these two <b>secular</b> cathedrals range from the processional to the aesthetic. As at Chichester, there is no northern range to the cloisters. In monastic cloisters it was the north range, benefiting most from winter sunlight, that was often used as a scriptorium.|$|E
5|$|Galeazzo Marescotti, {{a member}} of the zelanti, was the first serious {{candidate}} proposed two weeks in to the conclave. He was acceptable to the Spanish, but was opposed by the French because they wanted the new pope who was not strong. Bandino Panciatici was suggested by Pietro Ottoboni, but he was not supported by <b>secular</b> monarchs because he had supported giving benefices to nominees who were independent of the <b>secular</b> authorities. Giacomo Antonio Morigia was acceptable to the <b>secular</b> rulers, but was opposed by the zelanti for lacking governing experience in addition to not being firm or having the energy required. Following the proposal of these candidates, others came up as well, but were quickly rejected.|$|E

2500|$|According to a 2010 Israel Central Bureau of Statistics {{study of}} Israelis aged over 18, 8% of Israeli Jews define {{themselves}} as haredim (or Ultra-Orthodox); an additional 12% are [...] "religious" [...] (non-haredi orthodox, also known as: dati leumi/national-religious or religious zionist); 13% consider themselves [...] "religious-traditionalists" [...] (mostly adhering to Jewish Halakha); 25% are [...] "non-religious traditionalists" [...] (only partly respecting the Jewish Halakha), and 43% are [...] "secular". Among the <b>seculars,</b> 53% {{say they believe}} in God. Due to the higher birth rate of religious and traditionalists over <b>seculars,</b> their share among the overall population is growing as time passes.|$|R
5|$|Of the {{approximately}} {{two to three}} thousand volumes of Byzantine literature that survive, only 330 consist of <b>secular</b> poetry, history, science and pseudo-science. While the most flourishing period of the <b>secular</b> literature of Byzantium runs from the 9th to the 12th century, its religious literature (sermons, liturgical books and poetry, theology, devotional treatises, etc.) developed much earlier with Romanos the Melodist being its most prominent representative.|$|E

5|$|As bishop, de Gray {{settled a}} long-running {{dispute between the}} monks of his cathedral chapter and his {{predecessors}} as bishop. He also allowed the monks of his cathedral chapter the right to appoint and replace the clergy of the dependent churches of the cathedral. De Gray received a 1203 missive from Innocent III decrying the marriages of some <b>secular</b> clergy, in contravention of canon law. In more <b>secular</b> matters, he granted the town of Bishop's Lynn (now King's Lynn) the right to hold a weekly market and two fairs per year. He also built a palace at Gaywood.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the ninth}} century Alfred the Great started to revive {{learning}} and monasticism, and this work was carried on by his grandson, King Æthelstan (924–939). Kings before Edgar (959–975) did not take the view, which was adopted by Æthelwold and his circle, that the only worthwhile religious life was Benedictine monasticism. When Gérard of Brogne reformed the Abbey of Saint Bertin in Saint-Omer in 944, dissident monks found a refuge in England under King Edmund (939–946). Before the tenth-century reform, the lines between <b>secular</b> clergy and monastics were sometimes blurred. There are cases of communities of monks established to provide pastoral care, and clergy in some <b>secular</b> establishments lived according to monastic rules.|$|E

5000|$|Members {{of third}} orders are thus either (a) regulars, living in common under a {{religious}} rule of life, or (b) <b>seculars,</b> {{living in the}} world. The regulars take the three canonical religious vows; the <b>seculars</b> make promises, which are not considered binding under pain of sin, as are the vows of religious institutes, {{or in some cases}} may take private vows of obedience and chastity or in some cases even poverty, chastity and obedience (all according to their lay state). Their link with a religious institute is what distinguishes them from members of other [...] "associations of the Christian faithful" [...] and entitles their associations to be [...] "called third orders or some other appropriate name".|$|R

5|$|Dewi Zephaniah Phillips defended Wittgenstein's theory {{by arguing}} that {{although}} religious language games are autonomous, {{they should not be}} treated as isolated because they make statements about <b>secular</b> events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these <b>secular</b> events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical.|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert's {{problems}} with the monasteries in his diocese came from the <b>secular</b> practice of families setting up monasteries that were totally under their control {{as a way of}} making the family lands book-land and free from <b>secular</b> service. Book-land was at first an exclusive right of ecclesiastical property. By transferring land to a family-controlled monastery, the family would retain the use of the land without having to perform any services to the king for the land.|$|E

50|$|Depending {{on their}} {{existing}} provincial statutes {{and with the}} approval of their local council, their communities accept Catholics in good standing in the Church who meet the age requirement into formation. Admission into formation depends on a clear indication of a Carmelite vocation and maturity in faith as discerned by the local council of the community petitioned, and permission to profess the Promise of the <b>Seculars</b> requires a number of years spent in spiritual formation and the study of contemplative prayer {{under the direction of the}} community's formators. Catholics called to this vocation by God begin by discovering a community of <b>Seculars</b> which they visit for monthly meetings and may eventually join. Communities are listed in online provincial directories (see bibliography below).|$|R
50|$|<b>Seculars</b> are {{not members}} of the Scapular Confraternity, a newer {{development}} that is merely a pious association of Catholics who wear the small Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, {{commonly known as the}} Brown Scapular, and may or may not practice the primary principles of Carmelite spirituality. Any Catholic can be invested with the Carmelite Scapular by a Catholic priest, and indeed it is the most popular of Catholic scapulars because of the special promises made to its wearers by the Blessed Virgin Mary in apparitions. But the garment is properly the habit of the Discalced Carmelite Order, including the <b>Seculars.</b> Candidates for admission to the Order are clothed in the Scapular at the beginning of formal formation, usually during a Mass.|$|R

5000|$|There was {{question}} also of a [...] "regula canonicorum", or [...] "regula canonica", {{especially after}} {{the extension of the}} rule which Chrodegang, Bishop of Metz, had drawn up from the sacred canons (766). And when the canons were divided into two classes in the eleventh century, it was natural to call those who added religious poverty to their common life regulars, and those who gave up the common life, <b>seculars.</b> Before this we find mention of [...] "sæculares canonici" [...] in the Chronicle of St. Bertin (821) In fact as the monks were said to leave the world, sometimes those persons who were neither clerics nor monks were called <b>seculars,</b> as at times were clerics not bound by the rule.|$|R
50|$|Bishop Alnwick's visitation in 1440 is {{preserved}} in full. The prior complained that his canons were too fond of idle sports. The cellarer complained {{that there were}} too many boys in the choir, which was a hindrance to the divine office: he said the infirmary was out of repair, and that the obedientiaries ate in the town of Kyme when they went there on business, and one canon hunted for his own profit. Others complained of the accumulation of offices {{in the hands of a}} few, and of the too free access of <b>seculars</b> to choir and refectory. The bishop dealt with all these points. The time spent in games should be given rather to contemplation, reading and study; <b>seculars</b> should be banished from choir and refectory, and the infirmary repaired.|$|R
5000|$|Panzani himself {{realized}} that {{the appointment of a}} bishop was necessary, and he resented the efforts of the Jesuits to hinder this. Though he was successful in reconciling <b>seculars</b> with the Benedictines and other Catholics, the Jesuits were left out of the settlement, and Panzani's subsequent efforts to bring them in were fruitless.|$|R
