40|$|Defect {{detection}} is a {{major concern}} in quality control of various products in industries. This paper presents two different machine-vision based methods for detecting defects on periodically patterned textures. In the first method, input defective image is split into several blocks of size same as the size of the periodic unit of the image and chi-square histogram distances of each <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> with respect to itself and all other <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks</b> are calculated to get a dissimilarity matrix. This dissimilarity matrix is subjected to Ward's hierarchical clustering to automatically identify defective and defect-free blocks. The second method of defect detection is based on Universal Quality Index which is a measure of loss of correlation, luminance distortion and contrast distortion between any two signals. Quality indices of a <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> with respect to itself and all other <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks</b> are calculated to get a similarity matrix containing quality indices. Specific variances of the <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks</b> are derived from the quality index matrix through orthogonal factor model based on eigen decomposition. These variances are subjected to Ward's hierarchical clustering to automatically identify defective and defect-free blocks. Results of experiments on real fabric images with defects show that the defect detection methods based on chi-square histogram distance and universal quality index yield a success rate of 98. 6 % and 97. 8 % respectively...|$|R
30|$|According to {{the results}} we {{presented}} for {{the case of a}} silicon dislocation, the adaptiveness of the <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> matching copes fairly well with localized irregularities in the crystal structure. Nevertheless, the proposed <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> matching is generally limited to the assumption of a perfectly periodic crystal, which is usually of less interest to material scientists than crystals with (possibly multiple) defects or changes in the lattice orientation. Thus, we plan to improve and properly extend the block-matching strategy to these more complex geometries.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new machine vision {{algorithm}} for automatic defect detection on patterned textures {{with the help}} of texture-periodicity and the Jensen- Shannon Divergence, which is a symmetrized and smoothed version of the Kullback-Leibler Divergence. Input defective images are split into several blocks of {{the same size as the}} size of the periodic unit of the image. Based on histograms of the <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks,</b> Jensen-Shannon Divergence measures are calculated for each <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> with respect to itself and all other <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks</b> and a dissimilarity matrix is obtained. This dissimilarity matrix is utilized to get a matrix of true-metrics, which is later subjected toWard's hierarchical clustering to automatical ly identify defective and defect-free blocks. Results from experiments on real fabric images belonging to 3 major wallpaper groups, namely, pmm, p 2, and p 4 m with defects, show that the proposed method is robust in finding fabric defects with a very high success rates without any human interventio...|$|R
40|$|Similarity {{measures}} {{are widely used}} in various applications such as information retrieval, image and object recognition, text retrieval, and web data search. In this paper, we propose similarity–based methods for defect detection on patterned textures using five different similarity measures, viz., normalised histogram intersection coefficient, Bhattacharyya coefficient, Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient, Jaccard coefficient and cosine–angle coefficient. <b>Periodic</b> <b>blocks</b> are extracted from each input defective image and similarity matrix is obtained based on the similarity coefficient of histogram of each <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> with respect to itself and all other <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks.</b> Each similarity matrix is transformed into dissimilarity matrix containing true–distance metrics and Ward's hierarchical clustering is performed to discern between defective and defect–free blocks. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated for each similarity measure based on precision, recall and accuracy for various real fabric images with defects such as broken end, hole, thin bar, thick bar, netting multiple, knot, and missing pic...|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} algorithm for steering {{the spatial}} distribution of block estimates towards global uniformity achieves a significant improvement over the periodic block-matching BM 3 D for certain images. However, we also observed cases where the results are slightly worse compared to the <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> matching without this addition. Note that our uniform adaptive periodic block-matching BM 3 D is still significantly better than the original BM 3 D in all cases. Nevertheless, we plan to further investigate this phenomenon. The goal {{is to find a}} strategy that will at least sustain the quality of the estimate compared to plain <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> matching while improving it in the majority of the cases.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method to {{construct}} logarithmic signatures which are not amalgamated transversal and further do not even have a <b>periodic</b> <b>block.</b> The latter property was crucial for the successful attack on the system MST 3 by Blackburn et al.

40|$|Many {{algorithms}} {{for solving}} the Navier-Stokes equations require {{the solution of}} <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> tridiagonal systems of equations. By applying a splitting to the matrix representing this system of equations, it may first {{be reduced to a}} block tridiagonal matrix plus an outer product of two block vectors. The Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula is then applied. The algorithm thus reduces a periodic banded system to a non-periodic banded system with additional right-hand sides and is of higher efficiency than standard Thomas algorithm/LU decompositions...|$|R

Such strategy relies on the construction of pi-conjugated <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> copolymers from well-characterized parent polymers, {{in such a way that}} the above-mentioned electronic parameters can be predicted from the lengths of the blocks.

The shunt impedance is deduced from the currents and its sensitivity is found by variation of the parameters of the system. ...|$|R

Next we prove that, in general, such an intersection consists of a nonsingular hyperbolic set, finitely many singularities and regular orbits joining them. Afterward we exhibit a three-dimensional star flow with two homoclinic classes, one being positively (but not negatively) sectional-hyperbolic and the other negatively (but not positively) sectional-hyperbolic, whose intersection reduces to a <b>single</b> <b>periodic</b> orbit.
