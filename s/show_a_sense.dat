Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said before the vote that the odds of a [...] "two-state solution seems ever more distant" [...] and that [...] "leaders must <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of historic responsibility and vision. Israelis and Palestinians must break out of a zero-sum mentality and embrace a peaceful path forward." ...|$|E
2500|$|The writer {{changed the}} fate of another character, Krug's son Justin {{attempting}} to give the audience a better [...] "sense of hope". Craven points out that early on he suggested that Krug have a son who commits suicide, but found it interesting to see [...] "this strange Romeo and Juliet thing happening" [...] between Krug's son and Mari. He also stated that he likes the fact that John Collingwood is a doctor who actually gets to use his skills in the film, unlike in the original where the character is merely identified as being a doctor. Craven comments, [...] " [...] an extraordinary moment" [...] when John is forced to improvise a way to restore a collapsed lung; [...] "It made it real." [...] Ellsworth {{wanted to create a}} level of interest in the characters that would [...] "engage [...] ", as opposed to simply leaving the family in [...] "even worse shape [...] the end of the movie". He asserts that the film does not have a happy ending, but that there is some hope left at the end. Director Dennis Iliadis further explains that the point is to show the family from a different light. Initially the director feared that they were [...] "wussing out" [...] with the ending; he eventually decided that what you really see is a family that has physically survived this encounter, but are [...] "dead in many ways". Iliadis expressed {{that he did not want}} to go the way of [...] "torture porn", which is what he sees most horror films moving toward, but instead <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of [...] "urgency" [...] with the parents' actions.|$|E

[...] "If {{there was}} one thing in which you might think women would <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of some divine purpose in life, it is in the matter of children--and they show about as much care in that matter, oh!--as rabbits. Yes, rabbits! I stick to it. Look at the things a nice girl will marry; look at the men's children she'll consent to bring into the world. Cheerfully! Proudly! For the sake of the home and the clothes. Nasty little beasts they'll breed without turning a hair. All about us we see girls and women marrying ugly men, dull and stupid men, ill-tempered dyspeptic wrecks, sickly young fools, human rats--rats!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'In her circle,' Saupe continues, 'she {{was thought}} by her early playmates {{a kind of}} enthusiast; because she, with average faculties of {{understanding}} combined deep feeling, true piety and love of Nature, a talent for Music, nay even for Poetry. But {{perhaps it was the}} very reverse qualities in her, the fact namely that what she wanted in culture, and it may be also in clearness and sharpness of understanding, was so richly compensated by warmth and lovingness of character,—perhaps it was this which most attracted to her the heart of her deeply-reasonable Husband. And never had he cause to repent his choice. For she was, and remained, as is unanimously testified of her by trustworthy witnesses, an unpretending, soft and dutiful Wife; and, as all her Letters testify, had the tenderest mother-heart. She read a good deal, even after her marriage, little as she had of time for reading. Favourite Books with her were those on Natural History; but she liked best of all to study the Biographies of famous men, or to dwell in the spiritual poetising of an Utz, a Gellert and Klopstock. She also liked, and in some measure had the power, to express her own feelings in verses; which, with all their simplicity, <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> for rhythm and some expertness in diction. Here is one instance; her salutation to the Husband who was her First-love, on New-year's day 1757, the ninth year of their as yet childless marriage: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{look upon}} the [...] "Shepherd's Calendar" [...] as being {{no less a}} {{conscious}} and deliberate attempt at reform than Thomson's [...] "Seasons" [...] were in the topics, and Wordsworth's [...] "Lyrical Ballads" [...] {{in the language of}} poetry. But the great merit of these pastorals was not so much in their matter as their manner. They <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of style in its larger meaning hitherto displayed by no English poet since Chaucer. Surrey had brought back from Italy a certain inkling of it, so far as it is contained in decorum. But here was a new language, a choice and arrangement of words, a variety, elasticity, and harmony of verse most grateful to the ears of men. If not passion, there was fervor, which was perhaps as near it as the somewhat stately movement of Spenser's mind would allow him to come. Sidney had tried many experiments in versification, which are curious and interesting, especially his attempts to naturalize the sliding rhymes of Sannazzaro in English. But there is everywhere the uncertainty of a 'prentice hand. Spenser shows himself already a master, at least in verse, and we can trace the studies of Milton, a yet greater master, in the [...] "Shepherd's Calendar" [...] {{as well as in the}} [...] "Faery Queen." [...] We have seen that Spenser, under the misleading influence of Sidney[282] and Harvey, tried his hand at English hexameters. But his great glory is that he taught his own language to sing and move to measures harmonious and noble. Chaucer had done much to vocalize it, as I have tried to show elsewhere,[283] but Spenser was to prove ...|$|E

5000|$|Celia Winter-Irving said of Nicholas [...] "Unlike {{many other}} sculptors, Mukomberanwa speaks from {{personal}} experience rather than recounting what he has heard or been told.

50|$|All the Wild Horses is {{a tribute}} to the beast that has made much of what we call life possible.

50|$|The flag of Wales {{has been}} used by those in the arts, sport and {{business}} to <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of patriotism or recognition with Wales. During the 1999 Rugby World Cup, which was hosted in Wales, the opening ceremony used the motif of the dragon several times, though most memorably, the flag was worn on a dress by Welsh singer Shirley Bassey.|$|E

5000|$|Jeff Davis of Country Standard Time gave {{a mostly}} {{unfavorable}} review, saying that [...] "Sellers {{is just another}} artist crafted by the mainstream, {{trying to make it}} by imitation" [...] and that Sellers seemed to be emulating Vince Gill on some tracks.

5000|$|Country Standard Time critic Brian Steinberg cited [...] "Always the Love Songs" [...] as a {{standout}} track on the album, {{saying that it}} <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of interplay among the band members that was comparable to The Wallflowers. Andrew Leahey, reviewing the album for Allmusic, also compared the song's sound to that of The Wallflowers, saying that its intro was borrowed from [...] "6th Avenue Heartache".|$|R
50|$|All {{students}} must wear a uniform. The stated purpose for uniforms, often {{set forth in}} school-uniform policies, include reducing clothing expenditures for parents as well as avoiding distinctions among children based on whose parents can afford to buy them fashionable clothing to wear to school. The conservative clothing is also said to reduce distractions and help with student identification, ensuring that a stranger will stand out among the uniformed students. It also helps <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of modesty by all students.|$|E

On the contrary, the themes, apart from those mentioned, <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of belonging to a global (but not globalized) community, reflected in one of the lines from its first track: stories of a thousand cities, and a single neighborhood.|$|E

50|$|The group {{remembered the}} {{recording}} being a happy process, {{with a strong}} feeling of camaraderie and fun, with everyone keen to play practical jokes on each other, and <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humour. They were fans of Monty Python, and this style of humour influenced the lyrics and overall concept. Guitarist Martin Barre recalls the whole band coming up with various ideas for the music. Some parts were recorded in a single take, with every band member having important inputs into the music, including significant contributions from keyboardist John Evan.|$|E
50|$|The two {{attempt to}} <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of {{individuality}} and emotional disattachment from their spouse, each {{according to their}} respective point of view. While Eligio tries to {{make sense out of}} things, halfway acknowledging the extent of his feelings for his wife, still paradoxically giving in to outbursts of rage on occasions; Susana strains to convey an ideal of utter independence, as she feels the routine of her marriage holds her back. Motivated at first to prove her own self-worth, which she does find, she eventually experiences the certainty of her love for Eligio, in spite of all her efforts to stay away from him.|$|E
50|$|The {{longevity}} of dragons {{is evident in}} their often lackadaisical attitudes. Good-aligned dragons, while concerned with defeating evil, are able to see a much broader scope of the world, and although certain crises arise that may seem extremely important to good-aligned humans, their dragon counterparts are {{able to see the}} event as an unimportant hiccup that will pass in mere centuries; even those that adventure with others tend <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of incredible patience, even in situations where all others feel they've not a second to lose. Similarly, evil-aligned dragons that are crossed by belligerent adventurers may plot for dozens of generations before exacting revenge on the trespasser’s line - {{it is not uncommon for}} those descended from the mentioned adventurer to find themselves the target of a dragon based simply on their lineage.|$|E
