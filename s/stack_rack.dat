50|$|A stack machine - {{also called}} a <b>stack</b> or <b>rack</b> - has {{a set of}} {{rectangular}} plates that are pierced by a vertical bar which has holes drilled in it to accept a pin. Each of the plates has a channel on its underside (or a hole through the middle, as visible in the picture) that aligns {{with one of the}} holes. When the pin is inserted through the channel into the hole, all of the plates above the pin rest upon it, and are lifted when the bar rises. The plates below do not rise. This allows the same machine to provide several levels of resistance over the same range of motion with an adjustment that requires very little force to accomplish in itself.|$|R

40|$|PVC pipes are {{the most}} common {{building}} materials used in plumbing plants around the world since 1930. With a lightweight, strong, flexible, leak-proof and corrosion-resistant, and easy-to-assemble nature, the physical properties of these PVC pipes are potentially used in designing the interior forming and filling elements with the principle of "repurposing". In this design there are 2 issues that raised the how the potential of PVC pipe {{in the design of the}} forming elements and interior space filler and what are the advantages and disadvantages of the design of interior forming and filler elements that use PVC pipe as the main material when viewed from the properties of PVC pipe material, The application of mechanical, and modular systems. To identify the potential along with the advantages and disadvantages of PVC pipe in the design of interior elements, the authors develop a design method of design thinking from d 2 ̆ 7 school Paris. Design thinking d 2 ̆ 7 school Paris has several stages of the process which include the inspiration stage (understand, observe, and POV) in which all supporting data and information are obtained, ideation, prototype and test stages where all forms of experimentation and product manufacture are performed, As well as the implementation stage (story telling, pilot, and business mode canvas) in which the author tries to apply branding on products for commercial purposes. This design produces 5 interior design products such as chair, office table, coffee table, partition, and <b>stacking</b> <b>rack</b> with PVC pipe material main. These five products can prove the potential of PVC pipes in the design of interior elements in terms of material properties and application of the system. The design also proves that interior products with PVC pipe base materials have the advantages associated with manufacturing time and prove that mechanical and modular systems can be applied with PVC joints and tubes. In addition to the advantages, some shortcomings in the form of system applications and assembly processes that are less perfect can also be identified as material for further design development...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} web browsing {{paradigm is}} one of the most significant developments in the histories of publishing and human computer interaction. Yet clicking through links grows tedious, without affording dynamic knowledge building. What’s needed is a partially ambient visualization mechanism that sifts through focused subsets of web space, with our occasional attention. CollageMachine supports fluid adaptive dynamic browsing. The granularity of browsing is shifted down from documents to their constituent media elements. As time passes, elements of interest stream continuously into a recombinant information space that helps us locate and arrange information, and generate connections. An interactive interface maps the expression of interest together with direct manipulation of visual design. This mapping enables the user to effect the same information space visualization that the program is developing, and express dis/interest, with a single gesture. CollageMachine’s generative approach to browsing extends experience beyond routine, to support creative experience. Stochastic decision-making enables the recombinant information space to develop in a way that is predictable on the average, and yet still open to the unexpected, as while browsing a physical library’s <b>stacks</b> or store’s <b>racks.</b> Hypermedia structure forms the basis for an associative model that interprets the participant’s actions; like human memory, it learns through spreading activation. A diverse set of techniques, that have evolved through several generations of development, make this work. Seeds are initial documents that are fed to the collaging engine. A document's HTML markup serves as a contextual guide for breaking it down into information elements. Image processing creates cohesion among the elements, and foreground/background relationships that make the collage easier to read.

5000|$|A beaverslide {{will raise}} hay to a height {{that allows a}} haystack to be built as much as 30 feet high. A large hay crew is required, {{with a minimum of}} six people to operate all components. A load of hay is {{delivered}} {{to the base of the}} beaverslide, often pushed by a buckrake drawn by a team of horses or a tractor. The hay is loaded onto the rack, which when full is drawn up the inclined ramp by cables powered either by a second team of horses or a motorized vehicle such as a pickup or a tractor. At the top of the incline, the hay falls onto the <b>stack</b> and the <b>rack</b> is lowered for another load. The term [...] "butt" [...] describes the hay stacked by the beaverslide and has two meanings. A [...] "butt" [...] can be the amount of hay on a fully loaded rack, but the term also refers to the amount of hay that can be stacked by the beaverslide without moving it, roughly 24 tons of hay. The hay at the top of each haystack is stomped and piled higher towards the middle to allow rain to run off. Depending on the size of the field and the amount of hay produced per acre, once a beaverslide has created a stack, it can be moved a few feet to make a long, continuous haystack, or moved a longer distance to create multiple stacks within a field. Many are built on skids to facilitate being moved from field to field. If the hay is stacked properly, and remains uneaten, the hay in a beaverslide-constructed stack remains good at least two to three years, with some ranchers claiming it could last up to five or six years. In contrast, baled hay stored outdoors can begin to go bad after only one year.|$|R
40|$|The {{container}} traffic growth worldwide continues to increase. To {{keep up with}} the growth, shipping companies keep enlarging container ship size. The handling speed of the terminal will especially be a critical factor for the largest vessels. Terminals {{have to be able to}} serve these ships as best as possible. To keep the dwell time of the ships visiting a terminal to a minimum, the handling capacities on the terminal must get bigger. To achieve a maximum effectiveness of portainer productivity in relation to the land side of the terminal, the horizontal transportation and the stacking of the containers must be optimised. The amount of land available for expanding an existing terminal or creating a new terminal is scarce. When designing a terminal this is a very important factor to take into account. To minimise operating costs and maximise efficiency, automation of the terminal also is a factor to take into account. The goal of this study has been to design a container transhipment terminal capable of handling mega container vessels and analysing the logistic processes that take place on this terminal. The analysis will be performed by a computer simulation in the simulation language PROSIM. The designed transhipment terminal consists of three berths, two feeder berths and one mega vessel berth. The ship to shore container handling takes place by using portainers. The horizontal transportation takes place by rail mounted automated guided vehicles (rgv's) that use linear motor based transfer technology as their source of propulsion. The rgv's take corners by having their wheels rotated by four disks integrated in the rail system. Container storage takes place by <b>stacking</b> containers in <b>racks</b> placed in warehouses. This allows random access to the containers eliminating the time consuming shuffling. With these components a terminal layout has been designed. Based on this layout a computer simulation has been carried out in order to analyse the logistic processes on the terminal. Having assumed an average portainer capacity of 1 move per minute the achieved handling rates lie between 194 moves per hour and the 236 moves per hour for the feeder vessel berths, where the handling takes place by four portainers. The handling rates on the mega vessel berth lie between the 300 moves per hour and the 352 moves per hour. Here the vessel handling takes place by 6 portainers. Portainer occupancy rates of 95 - 98 % have been achieved during the unloading process of the container vessels. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
