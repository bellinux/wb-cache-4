50|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1980s, many United States-market {{vehicles}} equipped with a manual transmission began to have <b>shift</b> <b>lights</b> as standard equipment; these would usually signal for an upshift at an engine speed that provided maximum fuel efficiency, lower than the ideal engine speed for maximum BHP. The reason for this was, for a time EPA fuel economy testing rules stipulated that <b>shift</b> <b>lights</b> would be followed on vehicles so equipped- thus, they were calibrated for optimum fuel mileage on the EPA test cycle.

Ideally a shift lamp will illuminate at the engine speed beyond that which delivers the maximum BHP such that the BHP before and after shifting is the same. Accelerating the engine beyond this point is not conducive to rapid acceleration. In use a <b>shift</b> <b>light</b> allows the driver to judge the exact point that a gear change should be carried out without having to glance down at the tachometer.
