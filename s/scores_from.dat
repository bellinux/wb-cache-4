5|$|Final Fantasy XIII was {{positively}} received in Japanese magazines, garnering exceptionally high <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> both Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation. In the west, {{the game was}} praised for its graphics, battle system, and music, but opinions were mixed about its story and it was criticized for its highly linear structure. XIII also won an award for best graphics in GamesRadars 2012 Platinum Trophy Awards. XIII-2 received a positive reception overall, gaining perfect <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation, and high <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> most western sites. Common points of praise were its non-linear nature, improved battle system and graphics, while the main points of criticism were its story and characters, which were often called weak, confusing or both. Lightning Returns received mixed to positive reviews, with its combat being highly praised, its graphics and time limit mechanic drawing mixed responses, and the story and characters being cited as poorly developed.|$|E

5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since {{only the top}} two <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.|$|E
5|$|Individually, {{each game}} in the series has been {{generally}} well received. In 1995, Dark Forces became LucasArts' highest sell-in with more than 300,000 copies accounted for at launch. Games in the series have achieved consistently favorable review <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> most publications, and hold high aggregate scores on both Metacritic and GameRankings. The only exceptions are the PlayStation version of Dark Forces, which was perceived to have graphical problems and the GameCube version of Jedi Outcast, which was seen as considerably inferior to the PC and Xbox versions.|$|E
30|$|One {{year after}} treatment, {{the results were}} {{considered}} satisfactory with an almost complete resolution of symptoms. There were statistically significant results at the 12 -month follow-ups regarding the mean NRS <b>score</b> (<b>from</b> 6.25 to 0.2), the Constant Murley <b>Score</b> (<b>from</b> 66.7 to 79.4), the Oxford Elbow <b>Score</b> (<b>from</b> 28 to 46), and the AOFAS (from 71 to 86).|$|R

30|$|To {{evaluate}} the visibility, we assigned a <b>score</b> <b>from</b> 0 to 1 {{for each of}} the five following parameters: left ostium, right ostium, fundus, anterior wall and posterior wall. A <b>score</b> <b>from</b> 0 to 2 was classified as “bad visibility”, a score of 3 was classified as “moderate visibility” and a <b>score</b> <b>from</b> 4 to 5 was rated as “good visibility”.|$|R
5|$|Skyward Sword {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from multiple journalistic magazines and websites upon release: it received {{a score of}} 93/100 on aggregate site Metacritic based on 81 reviews. It was the site's 10th highest scoring game of 2011, and also ranked as the 6th best-reviewed Wii game of all time. It received perfect <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> multiple publications: these included Famitsu, IGN, Eurogamer, Game Informer, Edge Magazine and VideoGamer.com. In the case of Famitsu, Skyward Sword was the third Zelda title and sixteenth video game in the magazine's history {{to be given a}} perfect score at that time.|$|E
5|$|The Drakengard {{series has}} {{received}} mixed to positive reviews over the years. So far, the original Drakengard {{has received the}} most positive response. Nier has the highest aggregate score overall so far for the PS3 version {{of the game and}} slightly lower scores for the Xbox 360 version. Drakengard 2 and Drakengard 3 have received lower scores. Each title in the series has received favorable review <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu.|$|E
5|$|The {{interview}} and speech events are {{graded by two}} to three judges. The <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> the judges are averaged to give a maximum of 1,000 points per event. The essay is graded with a rubric and is read by two different judges whose scores are then averaged. If {{the difference between the}} judges' scores differs by 200 points or more, then a third reader is asked to grade the student's essay. The two scores that are closest in value are averaged to give the final score.|$|E
50|$|The final {{repeated}} the same free routine and the <b>score</b> <b>from</b> the final free routine {{was added to}} the <b>score</b> <b>from</b> the preliminary technical routine to decide the overall winners.|$|R
5000|$|The game's {{background}} music consists of Danny Elfman's <b>score</b> <b>from</b> Batman, John Williams' <b>score</b> <b>from</b> Superman, and original music written by Rob Westwood. It {{has been described}} as [...] "just right".|$|R
5000|$|The final {{scores are}} added up by <b>score</b> <b>from</b> 101 judges with <b>score</b> <b>from</b> fan vote. Huy Luân gets 27 out of {{possible}} 100 by audience voting, the rest belongs to Hải Châu.|$|R
5|$|Tournaments {{generally}} run for 10 consecutive episodes {{and feature}} 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. The winners {{of these five}} games, and the four highest scoring non-winners ("wild cards"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The winners of these three games advance {{to play in a}} two-game final match, in which the <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.|$|E
5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> the first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, the final result will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E
5|$|Academic Decathlon is {{designed}} to include students from all achievement levels. Teams generally consist of nine members, who are divided into three divisions based on grade point average: Honors (3.75–4.00 GPA), Scholastic (3.00–3.74 GPA), and Varsity (0.00–2.99 GPA). Each team member competes in all ten events against other students {{in his or her}} division, and team scores are calculated using the top two overall individual <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> each team in all three divisions. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded for individual events and for overall scores. To earn a spot at the national competition in April, teams must advance through local, regional, and state competitions, though some levels of competition may be bypassed for smaller states. Online competitions, separated into small, medium, and large categories, are also offered. USAD has expanded to include an International Academic Decathlon and has created an Academic Pentathlon for middle schools.|$|E

5|$|Charles X Gustav then granted Frederick William full {{sovereignty}} in the Duchy of Prussia {{in return for}} military aid, and in the Treaty of Radnot allied himself with the Transylvanian George II Rákóczi who invaded Poland–Lithuania from the southeast. John II Vasa found an ally in Leopold I of Habsburg, whose armies crossed into Poland–Lithuania from the southwest. This triggered Frederick III of Denmark's invasion of the Swedish mainland {{in the spring of}} 1657, in an attempt to settle old <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> the Torstenson War while Sweden was busy elsewhere. Brandenburg left the alliance with Sweden when granted full {{sovereignty in}} the Duchy of Prussia by the Polish king in the treaties of Wehlau and Bromberg.|$|E
5|$|Contestants' {{responses}} are revealed {{in order of}} their pre-Final Jeopardy! <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> lowest to highest. A correct response adds {{the amount of the}} contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it. The contestant with the highest score {{at the end of the}} round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.|$|E
5|$|Crime and Dissonance, a {{collection}} of Ennio Morricone's film <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> the 1970s, was conceived as a follow-up to Dagored releases Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001. However, that label abandoned the project, and Mike Patton of Ipecac Recordings decided to release it instead. Morricone had no input in the project; instead the track listing was assembled by Alan Bishop. Bishop had previously assembled the Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001 collections as well. All three compilations cover a roughly coterminous time period, spanning the late 1960s to the early 1980s, but concentrating primarily on the early 1970s. Bishop {{had been given a}} list of films whose scores were available to use in the collection; he set about compiling the two-disc set from there. However, the final song on the album, an eleven-minute section from the soundtrack to Un uomo da rispettare, {{was not included in the}} list of available material. The project was delayed for some time while Bishop waited for record label Sugar Music to license the song.|$|E

5|$|Public {{anticipation}} for {{the game}} was high, owing to the video's demonstration of some two-dimensional gameplay, seen as a possible return to Sonic's platforming roots. However, critical reception for Sonic Unleashed was mixed, with reviewers praising certain elements, such as the sense of speed in daylight stages and the graphics and audio {{that make up the}} environments, and criticizing others, such as the new Werehog game mechanic, as well as several gameplay and design concepts. Many reviewers felt that Unleashed was ultimately not the title that would be able to reinvigorate the series. Sonic Unleashed was de-listed in 2010, following Sega's decision to remove all Sonic titles with average or lower Metacritic <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> sale in stores. Despite this, the game was released on the PlayStation Network in April 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands scored first, but Kean soon equalised, {{assisted}} by Stewart. The Dutch team responded, but Gauci took two points with a fast break, and then assisted Crispin in putting Australia in the lead, one which the Gliders would not relinquish. Stewart made {{the next two}} <b>scores,</b> <b>from</b> outside the paint, and assisted Crispin to bring the score to 6–16. The Dutch team fought back, {{but there was a}} 12–18 deficit at quarter time. The Australian defence shut down their opportunities in the second quarter, and the score was 20–30 in Australia's favour at half time, and 29–40 {{by the end of the}} third quarter. The Dutch team redoubled their efforts in the final quarter, and won the quarter 20–18, but the Gliders won the game, 49–58.|$|E
5|$|A {{day after}} the draw against Vitesse, Ronald Koeman {{announced}} he would end his tenure as manager of Feyenoord {{at the end of}} the 2013–14 season. On 4 February the team beat Roda JC away 2–1. Immers and Armenteros scored to take a two-goal lead at half time, Roda got on the board near the end of the game. The win moved Feyenoord to two points behind Vitesse. The following Saturday Feyenoord played N.E.C. at home. The visitors took an early lead, before Immers and Pellè gave Feyenoord a one-goal advantage at half time. An additional goal by Pellè and two <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> Boëtius led to a 5–1 win that led Feyenoord to third place in the league table. On 16 February the club played away at NAC Breda. The game ended in a 1–1 draw; Janmaat scored the lone Feyenoord goal in the first half before NAC equalized from a penalty kick. Feyenoord played their last February match on the 23rd away against FC Twente. They created a two-goal lead halfway in the second half from goals by Pellè and Boëtius before Twente scored twice to lead to a 2–2 draw. The last goal came after 5 minutes of stoppage time and was controversial as it was even considered to be offside by Twente player Castaignos. The club ended February fourth in the league table.|$|E
30|$|Seven cystic {{fibrosis}} scoring systems for chest radiography with 25 or more citations {{were found in}} the Web of Science database, but the Shwachman-Kulczycki <b>scoring</b> system <b>from</b> 1958 [10], the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical <b>score</b> <b>from</b> 1973 [12] and the Royal Children´s Hospital (RCH) pulmonary <b>score</b> <b>from</b> 1981 [14] were excluded since the scores are a part of clinical scores not included in this review and other authors have shown that the Brasfield score [11] is superior to those scoring systems [36, 37]. Thus four radiography scoring systems remained for analysis: the Chrispin-Norman <b>scoring</b> system <b>from</b> 1974 [13] (with modifications 1982 [15] and 2005 [21]), the Brasfield <b>scoring</b> system <b>from</b> 1979 [11], the Wisconsin <b>scoring</b> system <b>from</b> 1993 [18] (with validation in 2000 [20]) and the Northern <b>scoring</b> system <b>from</b> 1994 [19].|$|R
