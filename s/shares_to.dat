5|$|While Theophilus Cibber was disputing with Highmore and Ellys, Aaron Hill became {{interested}} in partnering at the Theatre Royal. Hill was earlier a partner at the theatre until he was removed during a previous actor riot {{that took place in}} June 1710. On 22 March 1733, Hill, in a letter to Benjamin Victor, a dramatist who had arranged the sale of Booth's <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> Highmore, criticised {{the fact that he was}} kept from buying into the theatre's management and attacked Theophilus. He offered 900 pounds for three years for Booth's shares and 1800 pounds for Mary Wilks's shares. Negotiations continued until May when they were dropped. Hester Booth, widow of Barton Booth, sold her remaining <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> Henry Giffard, the manager of Goodman's Fields Theatre, just few days after her husband died on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|ATV Music {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue, Northern Songs, in 1969. The catalog featured almost every song written by Lennon–McCartney. Northern Songs was co-owned by Lennon, McCartney, Brian Epstein and Dick James, who owned a controlling interest. In 1969, James offered to sell his <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> ATV. Lennon and McCartney then attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company. Their bid to gain control, part of a long and acrimonious fight, failed. The financial clout of Grade, their adversary in the bidding war, ensured that the songs written by the two Beatles passed into the control of ATV.|$|E

As rail transport became more common, it displaced river transportation around the Great Depression. In addition, the Greater Moncton International Airport offered an airmail service from Moncton to Montreal by 29 December 1929. These factors further marginalised the Petitcodiac.|$|E

5|$|By 2November, all owners, {{except the}} two {{environmental}} organizations the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, had sold their <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> NSB. The two environmental organizations owned 7 of 40,000 {{shares of the}} company. At the general meeting the same day, the company was liquidated, even though the two organizations opposed. Prior to the meeting, the other minority owners had held a tactics meeting to discuss what to do. Several municipalities were concerned that they would lose even more money {{if they did not}} sell. The other minority owners agreed to cover the costs of the two environmental organizations, and let them make the principal stand to oppose the liquidation.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the deaths}} of two further partners, Backhouse in 1879 and Turnbull in 1880, Storey bought their <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> become the Echos chief proprietor. A year later, in 1881, he met Scottish-born millionaire Andrew Carnegie, and formed a {{syndicate}} with him to set up new newspapers and buy up others. Among those purchased were the Wolverhampton Express and Star, the Northern Daily Mail in Hartlepool and the Portsmouth Evening News. An attempt to buy the Shields Gazette, the country's oldest daily newspaper, failed. The syndicate finally broke up in 1885, with Storey retaining control of the Echo, Hampshire Telegraph, Portsmouth News and the Northern Daily Mail. These papers {{formed the basis of}} a new company, Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd, formed in the 1930s. The 19th century ended with the rivalry between the Echo and the Sunderland Daily Post intensifying. The Silksworth Colliery strike of 1891 pitted the two papers against each other, with the Post attacking Storey for having exploited the strike for political gain. Storey successfully sued for libel.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Bondevik's Second Cabinet and Liberal Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm {{decided that}} all ferry {{services}} in Norway would become subject {{to public service}} obligation (PSO). Innherredsferja held a concession {{until the end of}} 2006, but would have to bid for the service from 1 January 2007. The company would need expertise in both bidding and increased share capital to succeed in the bidding. By then, Fosen Trafikklag had bought 25% of the company, and the county and the municipality sold their <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> Fosen. Following this, a meeting was held on Ytterøy, where Fosen succeeded in securing a sufficient number of shares from the private owners to purchase the entire company. This valued the company at NOK23.1 million. Private owners were given the option to be paid in Fosen shares. From 1 July 2005, Innherredsferja was made a subsidiary of Fosen, but the company remained a separate limited company with its own board.|$|E

5|$|Kaladze became {{involved}} in the politics of Georgia {{as a member of the}} opposition Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia party founded by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili in February 2012. He was elected to the Parliament of Georgia on 1 October 2012. He was approved as Deputy Prime Minister as well as Minister of Energy in the cabinet of Bidzina Ivanishvili on 25 October 2012. The appointment was met with skepticism in professional energy circles. More importantly, it stirred an intense debate on a conflict of interest arising from Kaladze's business interests in the Georgia Hydropower Construction Company, in which Kala Capital owned 45 percent. Kala Capital sold the <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> GMC Group in November 2012 but concerns whether his indirect commercial interests had been abandoned remain.|$|E
5|$|Narvesen had an {{exclusive}} agreement with NSB to operate newsagent's shops at all railway stations, except in stations with restaurants, which were operated by Spisevognselskapet. Narvesen had a near-monopoly on newsagents in Norway, and rented facilities in many public places. The owners of Narvesen intended {{to create a}} foundation to obtain the company; when plans for this started in 1972, they had difficulties {{finding a way to}} transfer <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> the foundation without having to pay tax on the transaction. However, the tax laws permitted a tax-free transaction if {{it was part of a}} restructuring. A merger with Spisevognselskapet would be considered a restructuring, and in 1974 Fritt Ord was established to take over Narvesen's owners' share of the company. The agreement between Narvesen and NSB was made in July 1974; in December it was passed by Parliament, although the Conservative Party and Progress Party voted against the merger. A.S Narvesen–Spisevognselskapet was established on 1 January 1975. Fritt Ord owned 50% of the new company and NSB 41%. It assumed the Narvesen name in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Nokian Tyres (which had {{manufactured}} tyres {{under the}} Nokia brand; Nokian is the genitive) was split from the Nokia Corporation when Nokian Tyres Limited {{was created in}} 1988 as a joint venture company.

This made Bridgestone the largest shareholder, with an 18.9% stake, later diluted to 16.8%.

In 1911, Thompson feared the declining state of the Fairbanks economy and decided to leave Alaska. He sold his shares in the company, but returned after several months absence and demanded the shares back. Los Bernard, who briefly served as the paper's publisher, returned the <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> Thompson, who resumed his role as publisher and editor. Thompson's return coincided with a series of small gold discoveries at Livengood and Shushanna that boosted the Fairbanks economy, as gold-seekers bought supplies in the town.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{funded by}} the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold <b>shares</b> <b>to</b> local {{supporters}} for £1 via an application form. In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies. After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of £2,000. Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948, but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian, but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman.|$|E
