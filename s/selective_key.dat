In this paper we consider three malleability attacks on multi-party key agreement protocols. The first attack, called strong key control allows a dishonest principal (or a group of principals) to fix {{the key to a}} pre-set value. The second attack is weak key control in which the key is still random, but the set from which the key is drawn is much smaller than expected. The third attack is named <b>selective</b> <b>key</b> control in which a dishonest principal (or a group of dishonest principals) is able to remove a contribution of honest principals to the group key. The paper discusses the above three attacks on several key agreement protocols, including DH (Diffie-Hellman), BD (Burmester-Desmedt) and JV (Just-Vaudenay). We show that dishonest principals in all three protocols can weakly control the key, and the only protocol which does not allow for strong key control is the DH protocol. The BD and JV protocols permit to modify the group key by any pair of neighboring principals. This modification remains undetected by honest principals...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} genesis {{and maintenance of}} T cell memory remain unclear. In this study, we examined {{the evolution of a}} complex, antigen-specific T cell population during the transition from primary effector to memory T cells after Listeria monocytogenes infection. T cell populations specific for listeriolysin O (LLO) 91 – 99, the immunodominant epitope recognized by H 2 -Kd –restricted T lymphocytes, were directly identified in immune spleens using tetrameric H 2 -Kd –epitope complexes. The T cell receptor (TCR) V � repertoire of specific T cells was determined by direct, ex vivo staining with a panel of mAbs. We demonstrate that LLO 91 – 99 -specific, primary effector T cell populations have a diverse TCR V � repertoire. Analyses of memory T cell populations demonstrated similar TCR diversity. Furthermore, experiments with individual mice demonstrated that primary effector and memory T cells have indistinguishable TCR repertoires. Remarkably, after reinfection with L. monocytogenes, LLO 91 – 99 -specific T cells have a narrower TCR repertoire than do primary effector or memory T cells. Thus, our studies show that the TCR repertoire of primary effector T lymphocytes is uniformly transmitted to memory T cells, whereas expansion of memory T cells is <b>selective.</b> <b>Key</b> words: T cell receptor repertoire • cytotoxic T lymphocytes • Listeria monocytogenes...|$|E

40|$|Inventory of road {{infrastructure}} represents a key application for integrated mobile mapping systems. The classical {{approach is to}} post-process geo-referenced imagery that has been captured from mobile mapping vans while driving within the road. Problems arise then within city centres where dense traffic and parking vehicles may often hinder occlusion free image captures of the objects of interest. We present an alternative solution {{in terms of a}} mobile PDA based geo-information system for pedestrian based road sign data collection which is targeted towards complementing the classical approach, particularly in city centres. The novel system consists of a mobile computing unit which is equipped with a GPS sensor, a digital camera, a standard mobile GIS software, and a user interface for minimal user intervention. Imagery for road sign inventory is firstly captured and geo-referenced in the street and then analyzed in a second, off-line processing step. We present a post-processing tool for semi-automated classification of road signs, and in parallel an identification of the sub-plate information, strongly supporting the processing of huge data sets, e. g., for the processing of data from complete city areas. The tool includes advanced image analysis methodology with (i) localization of <b>selective</b> <b>key</b> descriptors and regions of interest, (ii) the fitting of geometrical constraints to the extracted set of interest descriptors, and (iii) the matching of content information from the visual information within the sign plate.

The goal of this research was to describe the main characteristics of the Moscamed Program, its explaining variables as well as regional fruticulture implications. This type of research was historical-descriptive, <b>selective</b> <b>key</b> informers trough random survey was used, structure surveys were applied to 27 producers. In the period of study results showed that: there was a continuing presence of cases of this plague, finding between 1992 to 1995 many cases; a decreasing assignment of economical resources to the program activities, In the first period the program had an allocation of US 11. 86 million of dollars, in the second US 5. 25. Negative attitudes to the program were found in 26 % of the producers, 93. 3 % of producers said that they did not know the objective and profits of the program and 33 % of them do not know its activities. This explains why producers did not participate and did not show interest in the program. Items which could explain the staying of the program in the analyzed period are: the presence of the plague in Guatemala, the plantation production system in the area, the migration of workers from Guatemala coming from infested regions as well as the decreasing resources allocation.

The argument advanced in this paper is that the use of ecological metaphors has been partial and <b>selective.</b> In <b>key</b> areas of theorisation such as industrial ecology the selective use of ecological metaphors has generated theoretical and empirical bias. In turn, this means that both our understanding of sustainability and our ability to create policy for the attainment of sustainability are, at best, partial.
