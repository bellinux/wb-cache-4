5|$|The green rosella has a {{repeated}} two-syllable contact call, {{which has been}} written as kussik kussik or cossack cossack and is heard in flight. When perched, it utters a rising kwik-kweek kwik-kweek contact call. Birds also make a chattering call during courtship. They can <b>screech</b> shrilly when alarmed.|$|E
5|$|Besides its prairie restorations {{and bodies}} of water, Silver Springs has areas of {{deciduous}} forests, and wetlands, {{both of which}} are populated with species of mammals, birds and insects. Bird life observed in the park includes: osprey, great horned owl, eastern <b>screech</b> owl and long-eared owl; bald eagle have been sighted further upstream along the Fox. Reptiles and amphibians are present in the park but are more elusive than other types of animal life.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of {{habitats}} in the park supports a diverse population of birds including some, such as the vermilion flycatcher and the whiskered <b>screech</b> owl, uncommon elsewhere in the United States. Among the park's 107 bird species are great horned owls, cactus wrens, ravens, kestrels, turkey vultures, roadrunners, woodpeckers, hawks, quails, and hummingbirds, and one threatened species, the Mexican spotted owl.|$|E

50|$|The Moheli {{scops owl}} is highly vocal, {{producing}} hissing whistles and <b>screeches</b> {{in a series}} of five notes, as well as <b>screeching.</b>|$|R
50|$|The call {{consists}} of high pitched notes and <b>screeches</b> somewhat {{similar to the}} sulfur-crested cockatoo. Large flocks will call simultaneously and can create a deafening <b>screeching</b> sound audible from several kilometers away.|$|R
5|$|Venom: Lethal Protector {{initiated}} the character's transition from unambiguous villain to anti-hero, and introduced several new characters (including Venom's symbiote offspring Scream, Phage, Riot, Lasher and Agony, who would recur in Marvel comics until the 2011 Carnage, U.S.A. limited series, vigilante group The Jury, its creator General Orwell Taylor, the Sentry, Bomblast, Ramshot, <b>Screech</b> and Firearm).|$|E
5|$|Adult mockingbirds {{can fall}} victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl, <b>screech</b> owl and sharp-shinned hawk, though their {{tenacious}} behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledgelings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish crows and American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park is home {{to several}} species of birds of prey. Ospreys build their nests in {{the tops of the}} tallest trees in the park and feed on the {{abundant}} fish of Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of owl, the great horned owl, barred owl and eastern <b>screech</b> owl, make their home in the forests of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Screeching</b> Weasel/Born Against split is a split E.P. {{featuring}} <b>Screeching</b> Weasel and Born Against. It {{was released}} in 1993 on 7" [...] vinyl and CD by Lookout! Records. The premise of this record is that Born Against wrote music for lyrics written by <b>Screeching</b> Weasel and vice versa. The double-sided cover art plays on their different styles, political hardcore and pop punk, as well.|$|R

5|$|Sound {{technicians}} {{spent the}} early part of the year trying to find the right sounds. Some, such as animal sounds like those of tigers and walruses, were bought. Human voices were also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the Nazgûl scream and David Farmer the Warg howls. Other sounds were unexpected: the fell beast's <b>screech</b> is taken from that of a donkey, and the mûmakils bellow comes from the beginning and end of a lion's roar. In addition, ADR was used for most of the dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Daenerys and her {{remaining}} followers build {{a funeral}} pyre for Drogo. Daenerys places her dragon eggs atop the pyre, and she orders Ser Jorah to tie Mirri to it. Having {{set fire to}} the pyre, Daenerys declares herself queen of a new khalasar, freeing those who would remain with her. Despite Jorah's worries, Daenerys then steps into the pyre. By daybreak, Jorah and the khalasar are surprised to find her unharmed in the ashes, carrying three dragon hatchlings. Amazed, they bow to Daenerys as one of the hatchlings clambers onto her shoulder and a dragon's <b>screech</b> is heard {{for the first time in}} centuries.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift (Apus pacificus) is a bird which breeds {{in eastern}} Asia. This swift is {{strongly}} migratory, spending the northern hemisphere's winter in Southeast Asia and Australia. The general shape and blackish plumage recall its relative, the common swift, {{from which it}} is distinguished by a white rump band and heavily marked underparts. The sexes are identical in appearance, although young birds can be identified by pale fringes to the wing feathers that are absent in adults. This swift's main call is a <b>screech</b> typical of its family. It {{is one of a}} group of closely related Asian swifts formerly regarded as one species.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{a number}} of {{independent}} punk bands such as The Apers, The Leftovers, The Manges, and The Unlovables cite <b>Screeching</b> Weasel as influential. <b>Screeching</b> Weasel has been categorized as skate punk, pop punk and punk rock.|$|R
50|$|The song is a coo-COO-coo. The {{collared}} dove {{also makes a}} harsh loud <b>screeching</b> call lasting about two seconds, particularly in flight just before landing. A rough way to describe the <b>screeching</b> sound is a hah-hah.|$|R
50|$|Foster {{reunited with}} <b>Screeching</b> Weasel again in 1996. The band lasted until 2001 before {{breaking}} up again. On March 27, 2009, Foster {{announced he was}} reforming <b>Screeching</b> Weasel. He and Danny Vapid were the only returning members.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does not sound like its name. It {{is best known for}} making a sound {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, clink, cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it was like the kling of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the <b>screech</b> of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the <b>screech</b> of a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations {{of what is going on}} in his head.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are ready}} to breed at ten to eleven months of age {{although}} males sometimes wait till the following year. Barn owls are usually monogamous, sticking to one partner for life unless one of the pair dies. During the non-breeding season they may roost separately, but as the breeding season approaches they return to their established nesting site, showing considerable site fidelity. In colder climates, in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce, they may roost in farm buildings and in barns between hay bales, but they then run the risk that their selected nesting hole may {{be taken over by}} some other, earlier-nesting species. Single males may establish feeding territories, patrolling the hunting areas, occasionally stopping to hover, and perching on lofty eminences where they <b>screech</b> to attract a mate. Where a female has lost her mate but maintained her breeding site, she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse.|$|E
50|$|After {{an initial}} {{break-up}} in 1989, <b>Screeching</b> Weasel reformed in 1991 and broke {{up for a}} second time in 1994. Following the second breakup, Foster formed a new band, the Riverdales, with <b>Screeching</b> Weasel members Dan Vapid, and Dan Panic.|$|R
50|$|Panic Button Records was {{a record}} label which was formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1997. It was co-owned by Ben Weasel and John Jughead, both members of <b>Screeching</b> Weasel. In 1998 the label was {{purchased}} by Lookout! Records when <b>Screeching</b> Weasel re-signed to Lookout!.|$|R
50|$|These lories {{are known}} as one of the louder species, and when kept in captivity, people's neighbors who desire quiet might be {{disturbed}} or annoyed by the bird's penetrating voice. The call is described as a shrill series of <b>screeches</b> in succession, or singular <b>screeches.</b>|$|R
5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating <b>screech</b> around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E

50|$|Sludgeworth {{was formed}} in 1989 as a side project from <b>Screeching</b> Weasel for Schafer (vocals) and Vermin (drums). Completing the line-up were Adam White (guitar), Dave McClean (guitar) and Mike Hootenstrat (bass). The band broke up in 1992 shortly after Schafer rejoined <b>Screeching</b> Weasel.|$|R
50|$|<b>Screeching</b> Weasel is the self-titled debut studio album by the Chicago-based {{punk rock}} band <b>Screeching</b> Weasel. It was {{originally}} released on vinyl {{with a limited}} pressing of 1,000 copies in September 1987 through local independent label Underdog Records and was the band's only album with bassist Vinnie Bovine, who was fired the next year. <b>Screeching</b> Weasel documents the group's early years as a hardcore punk band, with the music being heavily influenced by bands such as Adrenalin O.D., Angry Samoans, Circle Jerks and Black Flag.|$|R
50|$|The Riverdales {{were formed}} in 1994 by {{three members of}} <b>Screeching</b> Weasel (Ben Foster, Dan Schafer, and Dan Sullivan) when the former band disbanded. Just like with <b>Screeching</b> Weasel, Schafer played bass for the Riverdales but this time also shared lead vocals with Foster. They {{released}} their self-titled debut album in 1995 and their second album Storm the Streets in 1997 before the band broke up after <b>Screeching</b> Weasel reformed. They reformed in 2003 to release their third (and supposedly final) album. They once again reformed in 2008 and released an album in 2009 and another in 2010 making that {{a total of five}} albums. The band has been inactive since March 23, 2011 when all of the members quit on Ben Weasel under bad circumstances at a <b>Screeching</b> Weasel show.|$|R
25|$|<b>Screech</b> owls are {{primarily}} solitary. During the late winter breeding season, however, males make nests in cavities, sometimes reusing abandoned nests of other animals, {{to try to}} attract females. The females select their mate based {{on the quality of}} the cavity and the food located inside. During the incubation period, the male feeds the female. These birds are monogamous, with biparental care. The young of most <b>screech</b> owls are altricial to semi altricial.|$|E
