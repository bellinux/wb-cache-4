50|$|An {{audit of}} safety by {{regulators}} in 1998 proved {{a turning point}} in the history of the site, signalling the end of all nuclear operations and the beginning of the <b>site</b> <b>closure</b> programme. The original timescale for decommissioning of 100 years has been reduced steadily. Currently, the clean-out and demolition of all the redundant facilities is scheduled for completion by 2025. Hazardous intermediate-level waste will remain in secure, above-ground stores beyond this date pending a national policy for its long-term management. Access to areas of land contaminated with radioactivity is likely to be restricted until 2300. There is a debate about whether to retain the sphere as an industrial and architectural monument to the site's leading world role in the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|Some time in 2005, J. Keith Mularski {{from the}} National Cyber-Forensics & Training Alliance headed up a sting into popular English {{language}} site DarkMarket.ws. One {{of the few}} survivors of 'Operation Firewall', Mularski was able to infiltrate the site via taking over the handle 'Master Splynter', an Eastern European spammer named Pavel Kaminski. In late 2006 the site was hacked by Max Butler, who detected user 'Master Splynter' had logged in from the NCFTA's offices, but the warning was dismissed as inter-forum rivalry. In 2007 details of the operation was revealed to German national police, that the NCFTA had successfully penetrated the forum's inner 'family'. By October 4, 2007 Mularski announced he was shutting the site due to unwanted attention from a fellow administrator, ironically framed as 'too much attention' from law enforcement. For several years following <b>site</b> <b>closure</b> multiple arrests were made internationally.|$|E
5000|$|The open {{conformation}} {{state of}} sAC is reached when ATP, with Ca2+ bound to its γ-phosphate binds with specific residues {{in the catalytic}} center of the enzyme. When the second metal - a Mg2+ ion - binds to the α-phosphate of ATP leads to a conformational change of the enzyme: the close state. The change in conformation from open to close state induces esterification of the α-phosphate with the ribose in adenosine {{and the release of}} the β- and γ-phosphates, this leads to cyclizing. [...] Hydrogencarbonate stimulates the enzyme’s Vmax by promoting the allosteric change that leads to active <b>site</b> <b>closure,</b> recruitment of the catalytic Mg2+ ion, and readjustment of the phosphates in the bound ATP. The activator bicarbonate binds to a site pseudo-symmetric to the active site and triggers conformational changes by recruiting Arg176 from the active site (see above - [...] "structure"). Calcium increases substrate affinity by replacing the magnesium in the ion B site, which provides an anchoring point for the beta- and gamma-phosphates of the ATP substrate.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{trends in}} {{management}} consultancy and a drive for cost reduction across many industries {{has focused on}} employee engagement {{as a source of}} competitiveness with many management consultancies offering engagement measurement and interventions. Research into productivity in a <b>site</b> <b>closure</b> scenario highlights the existence of the ‘closedown effect’ where production improves during <b>site</b> <b>closure,</b> particularly in the presence of timely notification, the provision of a severance package, employee outplacement support and training and development allowance. This research points to high levels of employee engagement during the closure. High levels of employee engagement during a <b>site</b> <b>closure</b> would appear counterintuitive. This study is based on a sample of 125 employees being made redundant in an Irish pharmaceutical plant. Using a quantitative questionnaire and the UWES- 9 instrument; it explores employee engagement levels but fails to identify any relationship between engagement and demographic factors. The study identifies the impact of a training allowance on employee engagement and lastly investigates why employees themselves believe maintaining engagement is important in the face of redundancy...|$|E

40|$|The Office of <b>Site</b> <b>Closure</b> (OSC) {{was formed}} in November 1999 when the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Environmental Management (EM) reorganized to focus {{specifically}} on site cleanup and closure. OSC's objective is to achieve safe and cost-effective cleanups and closures that are protective of our workers, the public, and the environment, {{now and in the}} future. Since its inception, OSC has focused on implementing a culture of safe closure, with emphasis in three primary areas: complete our responsibility for the Closure Sites Rocky Flats, Mound, Fernald, Ashtabula, and Weldon Spring; complete our responsibility for cleanup at sites where the DOE mission has been completed (examples include Battelle King Avenue and Battelle West Jefferson in Columbus, and General Atomics) or where other Departmental organizations have an ongoing mission (examples include the Brookhaven, Livermore, or Los Alamos National Laboratories, and the Nevada Test Site); and create a framework a nd develop specific business closure tools that will help sites close, such as guidance for and decisions on post-contract benefit liabilities, records retention, and Federal employee incentives for <b>site</b> <b>closure.</b> This paper discusses OSC's 2001 progress in achieving site cleanups, moving towards <b>site</b> <b>closure,</b> and developing specific business closure tools to support <b>site</b> <b>closure.</b> It describes the tools used to achieve progress towards cleanup and closure, such as the application of new technologies, changes in contracting approaches, and the development of agreements between sites and with host states. The paper also identifies upcoming challenges and explores options for how Headquarters and the sites can work together to address these challenges. Finally, it articulates OSC's new focus on oversight of Field Offices to ensure they have the systems in place to oversee contractor activities resulting in site cleanups and closures...|$|E
