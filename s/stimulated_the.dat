5|$|As hoped by the {{original}} promoters, {{the opening of the}} line <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> construction of new areas of private and public residential development throughout the 1930s, although large areas remain as parks and playing fields. The St. Helier Estate was completed in 1936. The opening of the Wimbledon to Sutton line and the C led the population of the parish of Morden, previously the most rural of the areas through which the lines passed, to increase from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931 and 35,417 in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Charing Cross {{railway station}} {{was built on}} the Strand in 1864, {{providing}} a boat train service to Europe, which <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> growth of hotels in the area to cater for travellers. These included the Charing Cross Hotel, attached to the station itself. Today, there are several luggage outlets and tourist agents on the Strand, as well as old postage stamp dealers. The philatelist Stanley Gibbons opened a shop at No.435 in 1891. It moved to No.391 in 1893, and is now currently based at No.399.|$|E
50|$|By <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> hypothalamus, {{he could}} induce {{behaviors}} from excitement to apathy; {{depending on the}} region of stimulation. He found that he could induce different types of responses when <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> anterior (lateral) hypothalamus compared to <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> posterior ventromedial hypothalamus. When <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> anterior part, he could induce fall of blood pressure, slowing of respiration and responses such as hunger, thirst, micturition (urination) and defecation. On the other hand, stimulation of the posterior part led to extreme excitement and defense-like behavior.|$|R

5|$|In Europe the Renaissance of the 14th17th centuries heralded a {{scientific}} revival during which botany gradually emerged from natural history {{as an independent}} science, distinct from medicine and agriculture. Herbals were replaced by floras: books that described the native plants of local regions. The invention of the microscope <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> study of plant anatomy, and the first carefully designed experiments in plant physiology were performed. With the expansion of trade and exploration beyond Europe, the many new plants being discovered were subjected to an increasingly rigorous process of naming, description, and classification.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> nerves with {{electricity}} {{for half an}} hour, {{but was unable to}} demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that the dog had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E

Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> economy and increased trade across his empire. However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's manpower, greatly weakening it {{in the years after}} Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC).|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{therapy for}} {{prostate}} cancer targets the pathways the body uses to produce DHT. A feedback loop involving the testicles, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary, adrenal, and prostate glands controls the blood levels of DHT. First, low blood levels of DHT <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> hypothalamus to produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH then <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> pituitary gland to produce luteinizing hormone (LH), and LH <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> testicles to produce testosterone.

5|$|On {{the whole}} Australian {{commerce}} was expanded {{due to the}} war, although {{the cost of the}} war was quite considerable and the Australian government had to borrow considerably from overseas to fund the war effort. In terms of value, Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent, while the number of Australians employed in the manufacturing industry increased over 11 per cent. This was due in the most part to the reduced ability of traditional sources to continue supplying Australia with manufactured products, which out of necessity <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> development of the Australian manufacturing industry.|$|E
5|$|Roger de Busli died {{around the}} end of the 11th century, and was succeeded by a son, who died without an heir. The manor of Hallamshire passed to William de Lovetot, the {{grandson}} of a Norman baron who had come over to England with the Conqueror. William de Lovetot founded the parish churches of St Mary at Handsworth, St Nicholas at High Bradfield and St. Mary's at Ecclesfield {{at the start of the}} 12th century in addition to Sheffield's own parish church. He also built the original wooden Sheffield Castle, which <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> growth of the town.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Junction Canal {{came through}} the area between 1793 and 1800, with canal-side wharfs in Fenny Stratford, Great Linford, Bradwell and Wolverton. The route {{bypassed}} Newport Pagnell but, in 1817, an arm was dug to it from Great Linford. Trade along the canal <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> local economy.

5|$|The {{half century}} {{or so of the}} {{maritime}} fur trade and the North West Coast trade enriched Boston shipowners, creating capital that helped New England's transformation from an agrarian to an industrial society. The trade <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> culture of North West Coast natives, made Hawaii famous and nearly overwhelmed the native Hawaiians with foreign influences. It played a role in increased commercial pressure on China at Canton. Fur bearing animals were devastated, especially sea otters. By 1850, sea otters were virtually extinct throughout the North West Coast and found only in the Aleutian Islands and California.|$|E

5|$|After much discussion, {{the city}} of Munich, the state of Bavaria, Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich jointly decided {{at the end of}} 2000 to build a new stadium. While Bayern had wanted a {{purpose-built}} football stadium for several years, the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the FIFA criteria to host a World Cup game. Located on the northern outskirts of Munich, the Allianz Arena has been in use {{since the beginning of the}} 2005–06 season. Its initial capacity of 66,000 fully covered seats has since been increased for matches on national level to 69,901 by transforming 3,000 seats to terracing in a 2:1 ratio. Since August 2012, 2,000 more seats were added in the last row of the top tier increasing the capacity to 71,000. In January 2015, a proposal to increase the capacity was approved by the city council so now Allianz Arena has a capacity of 75,000 (70,000 in Champions League).|$|E
5|$|Gerald Fischbach {{spent nine}} {{years at the}} Washington University School of Medicine, where he served as the Edison Professor of Neurobiology and Head of the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology. During his time here, Fischbach {{continued}} {{his work on the}} ARIA protein. When ARIA isolated from chick embryo brain was applied to chicken myotubes, which are developing chicken muscle fibers, it was shown to increase the rate of insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes. This indicated ARIA could play a role in acetylcholine receptor insertion in neuromuscular junctions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that ARIA <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> transcription of α acetylcholine receptor subunits leading to an increase in α subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) and precursors, but had no effect on the mRNA levels of the γ or δ acetylcholine receptor subunits. This indicated that the amount α acetylcholine receptor subunit limits the synthesis and subsequent insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes.|$|E
5|$|In 1754, {{a stretch}} of road south of Altrincham, along the Manchester to Chester route, was turnpiked. Turnpikes were toll roads which taxed {{passengers}} {{for the maintenance of}} the road. Further sections were turnpiked in 1765 from Timperley to Sale, and 1821 from Altrincham to Stockport. The maintenance of roads passed to local authorities in 1888, although by then most turnpike trusts had already declined. The connection of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> development of market gardening, and for many years Altrincham was noted for its vegetables. By 1767, warehouses had been built alongside the canal at Broadheath, {{the first step in the}} development of Broadheath as an industrial area and the beginning of Altrincham's industrialisation. The canal was connected in 1776 to the River Mersey, providing the town not only with a water route to Manchester, but also to the Irish Sea.|$|E

In 1834, there was a distillery, a brewery, two tanyards, a malthouse and corn mills in full operation in the town. Several craftsmen carried on industries in smaller workshops and in their homes. With the increase in trade and manufactures went a corresponding increase in population. In 1800, the population was estimated at 1500; in 1841, it was 2836, and in 1846, it was estimated at 3000.|$|E
