40|$|Many {{failures}} in engineering applications or machine components {{have been caused}} by a crack initiated from points at which stress was concentrated. As the stress concentration level is higher than a critical value, continuous crack-growth results in failure in the machine components. Crack initiation behavior has been evaluated to prevent an early failure of machine equipment. Delaying the crack initiation is important for the maintenance of machine elements {{as well as for the}} detection of crack initiation. Hence, the main objective of this study is to investigate the delay of crack using <b>stop</b> <b>drilled</b> holes. The investigation was based on the diameter of the <b>stop</b> <b>drilled</b> holes and the arrangement of the <b>stop</b> <b>drilled</b> holes. Both experiment and finite element analysis were done in order to validate the result. The experiment was carried out by using tensile test to obtain maximum applied load to the specimen while the finite element analysis was analyzed by using ALGOR V 22 software to obtain the stress of the specimen. The experimental results and the finite element analysis results show that the crack initiation life of the specimen was longer when the diameter of the <b>stop</b> <b>drilled</b> holes increased. The further the location of the <b>stop</b> <b>drilled</b> holes with the slits location, the longer crack initiation life of the specimen. Thus, the influence of the <b>stop</b> <b>drilled</b> holes on the crack initiation life has been evaluated...|$|R

50|$|For {{economic}} and other reasons, {{oil and gas}} production often involves horizontal drilling of well paths many kilometers from a single wellhead. Accuracy requirements are strict, due to target size - reservoirs may only be a few tens to hundreds of meters across - and safety, because of the proximity of other boreholes. The most accurate gyroscopic method is expensive, since it can <b>stop</b> <b>drilling</b> for hours. An alternative is to use a magnetic survey, which enables measurement while drilling (MWD).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo test a {{modified}} otologic drill under different drilling conditions {{for its ability}} to identify drilling faults and <b>stop</b> <b>drilling.</b> MethodsBased on force analysis and previous works, anotologic drill was modified and equipped with three sensors. Under various conditions, the drill was used to simulate three drilling faults and normal drilling, and signals from the drill were analyzed to extract the characteristic signal. A multi–sensor information fusion system and a stop program were designed to recognize drilling faults and <b>stop</b> <b>drilling.</b> ResultsSignals from each sensor changed consistently in response to drilling condition changes, with high repeatability and regularity. The average identification rate was 72. 625 %, 68. 575 %, 70. 5 % and 81. 3 % respectively for the three simulated drilling faults and normal drilling. The stop program stopped drilling in 0. 2 ~ 0. 3 seconds when a drilling faults was detected. ConclusionsThis study shows that the forces acting on the drill bit change predictably in the three simulated drilling conditions; that using suitable BP neural networks, the drilling faults can be reliably identified, and that a stop program based upon characteristic signal recognition can <b>stop</b> <b>drilling</b> quickly upon detecting drilling faults. This lays a foundation for development of a system capable of predicting drilling faults and automatic drill control.

40|$|Measures {{to reclaim}} both the static {{strength}} and the fatigue life of plates with cracks are examined experimentally on 2024 aluminium alloy specimens.

To enhance the fatigue life of a cracked plate the process of <b>stop</b> <b>drilling</b> the crack tips, cold expanding the resulting holes and inserting interference-fit steel plugs has dramatically increased fatigue resistance. For the same spectrum fatigue life the stresses in the life-enhanced plates need to be 2. 6 times those in the plain cracked plates.

Considering that it has not been a regulatory problem to use hydraulic fracturing in Germany before, the impact of this discourse becomes evident. It is worth mentioning that some drilling companies like Wintershall have declared that they will voluntarily abstain from utilizing hydraulic fracturing in Germany for the time being [28]. Although there is no coercive legal reason in the current regulation which could <b>stop</b> <b>drilling</b> companies from acquiring permissions to explore possible shale gas reserves [29], no permissions have been issued during the last 2  years.

40|$|Fractured {{basement}} reservoirs {{are most}} commonly defined as metamorphic and igneous rocks unconformably overlain by a sedimentary sequence, where faulting {{has led to}} the creation of a natural fracture network where hydrocarbons can accumulate. Here, we also consider basement rocks to include those of sedimentary origin with little or no matrix porosity (North, 1990), such as the Cambro-Ordovician quartzitic sandstones of the Table Mountain group in South Africa. Fractured quartzites and granites are generally considered to be the optimum reservoirs (Koning, 2013). Basement reservoirs have been recognized for decades but are still often disregarded – with wells barely penetrating them – as many oil companies <b>stop</b> <b>drilling</b> as soon as basement rocks are intersected. Where basement has been penetrated to a sufficient depth (approximately 300 m), significant volumes of undiscovered hydrocarbons may still have been missed by a failure to intersect the fracture systems (Aguilera, 1996).

It allows us to open new horizons and gather required experience for the future projects. Sometimes, one oil platform derives more oil than subsidiary oil company may.

Therefore, oil companies aim at an operating cost reduction, ensuring the reliability and integrity of all platform systems, and their downtime reduction. The problem, which will {{be considered in the}} thesis, is an artificial oil production system failure (namely upper completion and ESP). Sometimes oil platforms have one drilling rig and sometimes even do not have and in a case of failure of any main module of the upper completion, the oil production stops and it will be continued only after replacement of broken equipment and pulling a new one, But what we have in a case while drilling?

40|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to find a way}} of {{improving}} the damage tolerance of composite bonded repairs to metallic aircraft structures, the effect of using conventional crack growth retardation techniques in conjunction with bonded repairs was experimentally investigated. Hence, an experimental test program was set up to determine whether fatigue crack growth under bonded repairs is retarded further by giving the crack to be repaired a crack growth retardation treatment prior to repair patch application. In addition, it was set up to determine the influence of a bonded repair on the effectiveness of a crack growth retardation method. Centrally cracked aluminium plates were used. <b>Stop</b> <b>drilling</b> followed by cold hole expansion and the application of single overloads were selected as retardation treatments. Two patch materials were considered; boron/epoxy and Glare 2. Further test variables were the aluminium alloy and the plate thickness. Fatigue testing was carried out under constant amplitude loading and baseline results were determined first. In addition to optically monitoring the crack growth, local and global out-of-plane deformations were visualised with holographic interferometry and shadow moireì. Furthermore, the stress intensity factors under the repair patch were examined with strain gauges and measurement of the central crack opening displacement. Disbonds and fracture surfaces were studied after residual strength tests. The crack growth results obtained showed that retardation treatments decrease crack growth rates under a repair patch and that the effectiveness of a retardation treatment is increased by the patch. Although identical crack growth rates were observed under boron/epoxy and Glare 2 patches, the reinitiation period after the retardation treatment lasted longer when Glare 2 patches were applied. Analytical predictions of the extent of retardation based on existing models showed that the conjunctive effect of retardation treatments and bonded repairs was underestimated. A sustained reduction in crack growth rates was observed under bonded repairs with a prior overload retardation treatment. It was concluded that the damage tolerance of bonded repairs is increased by the application of a crack growth retardation treatment because the crack growth is retarded further. These findings indicate that the range of cracks in aircraft for which bonded repairs can be considered is expanded and that economic benefits can be obtained...|$|E
