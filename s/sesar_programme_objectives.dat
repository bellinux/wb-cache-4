40|$|The dynamic {{development}} of the air transport market {{has led to a}} significant increase in air traffic in a highly fragmented and relatively small European airspace. This situation could, in the near future, render the currently functioning European air traffic management (ATM) system obsolete and incapable of providing the high safety standards demanded by the ICAO and Eurocontrol. Recognizing the urgency in finding a solution to this problem, the EU gas launched the Single European Sky (SES) initiative, along with its technological pillar, the Single European Sky ATM Research (<b>SESAR)</b> <b>programme,</b> which seeks to enhance air traffic safety, support the sustainable {{development of}} the air transport system and improve the overall performance of ATM and air navigation services, so that they meet the requirements of all airspace users. This paper presents a selection of the <b>SESAR</b> <b>programme’s</b> key technological solutions, such as approaches based on area navigation (RNAV) /Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), and the “remote tower” concept, which have been developed to maximize the safety and efficiency of the new European ATM system...|$|R

50|$|In the 20th century, unlike United States, Europe did {{not have}} a single {{civilian}} airspace — i.e., one in which air navigation is managed at the European level. Furthermore, European airspace is among the busiest in the world with over 33,000 flights daily and airport density in Europe is very high. This makes air traffic control more complex.The EU Single European Sky (SES) legislature was drawn to overcome the air control management's fragmentation and flight capacity limitation by structuring airspace and air navigation services at a pan-European level.To develop the needed technological capacity, the <b>SESAR</b> <b>programme</b> was initiated in 2004 as a continuation of a smaller effort by Eurocontrol, SESAME-project.In June 2010, European and American authorities reached a preliminary agreement on interoperability between their future air traffic management systems, SESAR and NextGen.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the role of {{research}} organizations within the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR 2020) Research and Innovation (R&I) <b>Programme.</b> The <b>SESAR</b> 2020 <b>Programme</b> (2016 to 2021) is intended to demonstrate the viability of the technological and operational solutions already developed within the preceding <b>SESAR</b> R&I <b>Programme</b> (from 2008 to 2016) in larger and more operationally-integrated environments. SESAR 2020 is divided into two sections. One part is the so called Industrial Research (IR) and Very Large Demonstrations (VLD) part with a funding of 398 Mio. € conducted by a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) consisting of 19 members. The second part is the so called Exploratory Research (ER) part with a funding of 81 Mio. € contracted via open Horizon 2020 calls. While the Exploratory Research covers the lower Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 1 and 2 the Industrial Research is covering TRL 3 to 6. The above mentioned Very Largescale Demonstrations are organized in two ways. They are partly covered by the members of the PPP and partly contracted via open Horizon 2020 calls with a funding of 37 Mio. €. These calls are especially addressing the involvement of the airspace users, e. g. airlines. The only research organizations which are full members of the PPP are: 1) Stiftelsen SINTEF from Norway as part of the North European ATM Industry Group - NATMIG Consortium 2) Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft-und Raumfahrt e. V., DLR (German Aerospace Centre) and 3) Netherlands Aerospace Centre, NLR together forming the AT-One Consortium. All three organizations are involved in every part of the <b>SESAR</b> 2020 research <b>programme.</b> In addition they are coordinating several projects in the Exploratory Research section plus one project in Industrial Research section and one Very Largescale Demonstration. From the experience gained within these three research organizations, this paper will give an overview about the different research topics as well as about the role of research organizations within the <b>SESAR</b> 2020 <b>programme...</b>|$|R

The main objective of this work is to conduct a teaching experience using a flight simulation environment so that the students of Aeronautical Management degree can assume the role of an aircraft pilot, in order to allow the students understanding the basic processes of the air navigation and observe how the new technologies can transform and improve these processes. This is especially helpful in classroom to teach the contents of the Single European Sky ATM Research (<b>SESAR)</b> <b>programme,</b> an European project that introduces a new Air Traffic Management (ATM) paradigm based on several relevant technological and procedural changes that will affect the entire air transportation system in the short and medium term.

40|$|As {{acknowledged}} by the <b>SESAR</b> <b>programme,</b> current ATC systems must be drastically improved {{to accommodate the}} predicted traffic growth in Europe. In this context, the Episode 3 project aims at assessing the performance of new ATM concepts, like 4 D-trajectory planning and strategic deconfliction. One of the bottlenecks impeding ATC performances is the hourly capacity constraints defined on each en-route ATC sector to limit the rate of aircraft. Previous works were mainly focused on optimizing the current ground holding slot allocation process devised to satisfy these constraints. We propose to estimate the cost of directly solving all conflicts in the upper airspace with ground holding, provided that aircraft were able to follow their trajectories accurately. We present a Constraint Programming (CP) model of this large scale combinatorial optimization problem and the results obtained with the FaCiLe constraint library. We study the effect of uncertainties on the departure time and estimate the cost of improving the robustness of our solutions with the CATS simulator. Encouraging results were obtained without uncertainty but the costs of robust solutions are prohibitive. Our approach may however be improved e. g. with a prior flight level allocation and the dynamic resolution of remaining conflicts with one of CATS' module...|$|R

40|$|Complex Systems {{are those}} in which {{a very large number}} of {{elements}} interact, usually in a non-linear fashion, producing emergent behaviors that are typically difficult to predict. Air transportation systems fall in this category, with a large number of aircraft following a pre-scheduled program. It has been shown that it is possible to understand and forecast delays propagation in these systems. The objective of this analysis is to compare the modeling in the US and in the European air traffic networks, analyzing the propagation of delays due to failures in the schedule or to disturbances. We use two different agent based models recently developed to simulate the delays propagation and assess the effect of disruptions in the networks (US and ECAC areas). Our results show that a first-come first-served protocol managing the flights produces larger congestion when compared with an ATFM (Air Traffic Flow Management) slots priority system.
