50|$|The <b>spacistor</b> was {{a type of}} {{transistor}} {{developed in}} the 1950s as an improvement over the point-contact transistor and the later alloy junction transistor. It offered much higher speed than earlier transistors. It became obsolete in the early 1960s {{with the development of}} the diffusion transistor.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{developments}} {{included the}} grown-junction transistor (1951), the surface-barrier transistor (1953), the diffusion transistor, the tetrode transistor, and the pentode transistor. The diffused silicon 'mesa transistor' was developed at Bell in 1955 and made commercially available by Fairchild Semiconductor in 1958. The <b>spacistor</b> [...] was {{a type of}} transistor developed in the 1950s as an improvement over the point-contact transistor and the later alloy junction transistor. [...] In 1953, Philco had developed the world's first high frequency surface-barrier transistor, which {{was also the first}} transistor that was suitable for high speed computers. The world's first all-transistor car radio, manufactured by Philco in 1955, used surface-barrier transistors in its circuitry design.|$|E
50|$|In 2000 Eternal Elysium {{signed to}} MeteorCity and {{released}} their second album, Spiritualised D. Okuyama left in mid 2000 {{and was replaced}} by bassist Toshiaki Umemura and Kuroda left in 2002 shortly before the recording the band's third album, Share. Rio Okuya was brought in to record some percussion for the album before drummer Tom Huskinson was found and brought in to finish the recording. The band released a split with Of the <b>Spacistor</b> in 2003. The band re-emerged in 2005 with a new bassist, Tana Haugo, and new drummer, Antonio Ishikawa and released their 2005 album, Searching Low & High, on Diwphalanx Records. They also appeared on the live DVD Wizard's Convention: Japanese Heavy Rock Showcase alongside fellow Japanese bands Boris, Church of Misery and Greenmachine. In 2007 the band released a split CDEP with Black Cobra. In 2009 they released the album Within the Triad. After 7 years since album Within the Triad the band released new album Resonance of Shadows on Cornucopia Records label.|$|E
