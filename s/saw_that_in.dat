5|$|The club won {{its first}} FA Cup in 1887, under the {{captaincy}} of another Scotsman, Archie Hunter. They beat West Bromwich Albion 2–0 {{in the final}} held at The Oval. Up until 1885, football had remained an amateur sport. It turned professional in 1885, when the FA legalized professional football, but with a national wage limit. However, the Scottish draper and director of Aston Villa, William McGregor had become frustrated with watching his team in one-sided friendly matches and low attendances for all games but FA Cup ties. He <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> order to keep interest in the game alive, the top teams needed to play {{each other in a}} league much like American baseball teams did. McGregor wrote to the twelve leading clubs in England proposing the formation of a league, what would later be known as the English Football League. Aston Villa were one of the dozen teams that competed in the inaugural Football League in 1888. Villa's first League game came on 8 September 1888, when they drew 1–1 Wolverhampton Wanderers as Tom Green scored the club's first League goal. Villa finished runners-up to Preston North End in that inaugural season.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wake}} of Nur ad-Din's death, Saladin faced a {{difficult}} decision; he could move his army against the Crusaders from Egypt or wait until invited by as-Salih in Syria {{to come to his}} aid and launch a war from there. He could also take it upon himself to annex Syria before it could possibly {{fall into the hands of}} a rival, but he feared that attacking a land that formerly belonged to his master—forbidden in the Islamic principles in which he believed—could portray him as hypocritical, thus making him unsuitable for leading the war against the Crusaders. Saladin <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> order to acquire Syria, he either needed an invitation from as-Salih, or to warn him that potential anarchy could give rise to danger from the Crusaders.|$|E

On drawing level with Senna, Vettel commented: [...] "To win that third title here, where one of my greatest idols, Ayrton Senna, was from, {{it is very difficult}} to imagine I join him and other great names by winning three successive titles".

2500|$|Interpreting the words, [...] "And Phineas, {{the son of}} Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it," [...] in [...] the Gemara {{asked what}} Phineas saw. [...] Rav said that Phineas saw what was {{happening}} and remembered the law governing intimacy with an idolatrous woman, and asked Moses whether he had not taught that zealots may punish one who cohabits with an idolatrous woman. [...] Moses replied that he who reads the letter should be the agent to carry out its instructions. [...] Alternatively, Samuel said that Phineas <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> (<b>in</b> the words of [...] ) [...] "There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord," [...] which he interpreted to mean that whenever the Divine Name is being profaned, one may relax the general principle that one must defer to one's teacher — the giver of wisdom — and go ahead to make a legal decision in the presence of one's teacher. [...] Rabbi Isaac said in Rabbi Eleazar's name that Phineas saw the Angel of Death wreaking destruction among the people, and (in the words of [...] ) [...] "he rose up out of the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand." [...] Thus, Phineas must not have had his spear when he sat among the congregation, and from this we learn that one may not enter a house of learning with weapons.|$|E

"It {{does not}} become anyone to drop a word of doubt here and there that shall work like poison in other minds, shaking their {{confidence}} in the messages which God has given, which have aided in laying the foundation of this work, and have attended it to the present day, in reproofs, warnings, corrections, and encouragements. To all who have {{stood in the way}} of the Testimonies, I would say, God has given a message to His people, and His voice will be heard, whether you hear or forbear. Your opposition has not hindered me; but you must give an account to the God of heaven, who has sent these warnings and instructions to keep His people in the right way. You will have to answer to Him for your blindness, for being a stumbling block in the way of sinners." [...] "I saw the state of some who stood on present truth, but disregarded the visions,--the way God had chosen to teach in some cases, those who erred from Bible truth. I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> striking against the visions they did not strike against the worm--the feeble instrument that God spake through--but against the Holy Ghost. I saw it was a small thing to speak against the instrument, but it was dangerous to slight the words of God. I saw if they were in error and God chose to show them their errors through visions, and they disregarded the teachings of God through visions, they would be left to take their own way, and run in the way of error, and think they were right, until they would find it out too late." ...|$|E
