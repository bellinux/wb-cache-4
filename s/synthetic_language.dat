5|$|Ancient Egyptian was a <b>synthetic</b> <b>language,</b> but {{it became}} more {{analytic}} later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. There was a change from the older verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic.|$|E

25|$|Franco-Provençal is a <b>synthetic</b> <b>language,</b> as are Occitan and Italian. Most verbs have {{different}} endings for person, number, and tenses, making {{the use of}} the pronoun optional; thus, two grammatical functions are bound together. However, the second person singular verb form regularly requires an appropriate pronoun for distinction.|$|E
50|$|Many {{languages}} {{have developed}} agglutination. This developmental phenomenon {{is known as}} language drift. There seems to exist a preferred evolutionary direction from agglutinative <b>synthetic</b> <b>languages</b> to fusional <b>synthetic</b> <b>languages,</b> and then to non-synthetic languages, which in their turn evolve into isolating languages and from there again into agglutinative <b>synthetic</b> <b>languages.</b> However, {{this is just a}} trend, and in itself a combination of the trend observable in Grammaticalization theory and that of general linguistic attrition, especially word-final apocope and elision.|$|R
50|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>languages</b> compose (synthesize) {{multiple}} concepts {{into each}} word, while analytic languages break up (analyze) concepts into separate words. The distinction {{is a matter}} of degree: the most analytic languages consistently have one morpheme per word, while, at the other extreme, in polysynthetic languages, a single inflected verb may contain as much information as an entire English sentence. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>languages</b> lie between the two.|$|R
50|$|Sauk is a polysynthetic language. Because {{this can}} easily pose great {{difficulties}} to learners {{with little to}} no experience with highly <b>synthetic</b> <b>languages,</b> the Sauk orthography has words written by identifying each syllable.|$|R
25|$|There {{also seems}} to be a marked {{tendency}} to confuse different forms even when they have not become homophonous (like in the generally more distinct plurals), which indicates nominal declension was not only shaped by phonetic mergers, but also by structural factors. As a result of the untenability of the noun case system after these phonetic changes, Vulgar Latin shifted from a markedly <b>synthetic</b> <b>language</b> to a more analytic one.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of Old Norse certainly helped move English from a <b>synthetic</b> <b>language</b> towards a more analytic or isolating word order, a deep {{change at the}} grammatical level. The eagerness of Vikings in the Danelaw to communicate with their southern Anglo-Saxon neighbors produced a friction {{that led to the}} erosion of the complicated inflectional word-endings; Old Norse likely had a greater impact on this deep change to Middle and Modern English than any other language. Simeon Potter notes: [...] "No less far-reaching was the {{influence of}} Scandinavian upon the inflexional endings of English in hastening that wearing away and leveling of grammatical forms which gradually spread from north to south. It was, after all, a salutary influence. The gain was greater than the loss. There was a gain in directness, in clarity, and in strength".|$|E
2500|$|An {{accomplished}} musician, Burgess composed regularly {{throughout his}} life, and once said, [...] "I wish {{people would think}} of me as a musician who writes novels, instead of a novelist who writes music on the side." [...] Several of his pieces were broadcast during his lifetime on BBC Radio. His Symphony No. 3 in C was premiered by the University of Iowa orchestra in Iowa City in 1975. Burgess described his Sinfoni Melayu as an attempt to [...] "combine the musical elements of the country into a <b>synthetic</b> <b>language</b> which called on native drums and xylophones." [...] The structure of [...] (1974) was modelled on Beethoven's Eroica symphony, while Mozart and the Wolf Gang (1991) mirrors the sound and rhythm of Mozartian composition, among other things attempting a fictional representation of Symphony No.40. Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 features prominently in A Clockwork Orange (and in Stanley Kubrick's film version of the novel). Many of his unpublished compositions are listed in This Man and Music. [...] He wrote a good deal of music for recorder as his son played the instrument. [...] Several of his pieces for recorder and piano including the Sonata No. 1, Sonatina and [...] "Tre Pezzetti" [...] have been included on a major CD release from recorder player John Turner and pianist Harvey Davies; the double album also includes related music from 15 other composers and is titled Anthony Burgess – The Man and his Music (Metier records, release September 2013).|$|E

50|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>languages</b> form {{words by}} {{affixing}} a given number of dependent morphemes to a root morpheme. The morphemes may be distinguishable from the root, {{or they may}} not. They may be fused with it or among themselves (in that multiple pieces of grammatical information may potentially be packed into one morpheme). Word order is less important for these languages {{than it is for}} analytic languages, since individual words express the grammatical relations that would otherwise be indicated by syntax. In addition, there tends to be a high degree of concordance (agreement, or cross-reference between different parts of the sentence). Therefore, morphology in <b>synthetic</b> <b>languages</b> is more important than syntax. Most Indo-European <b>languages</b> are moderately <b>synthetic.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{morphological}} analysis - allowing for many different forms of a word depending on its grammatical role - provides a significant benefit for English, though its benefits for highly <b>synthetic</b> <b>languages</b> such as German, Hungarian or Turkish are clear.|$|R

5000|$|The {{existence}} and span of rules of morphemes {{in a language}} depend on the [...] "morphology" [...] in that particular language. In a language having greater morphology, a word would have an internal compositional structure in terms of word-pieces (i.e. free morphemes - Bases) and those would also possess bound morphemes like affixes. Such a morpheme-rich language is termed as <b>synthetic</b> <b>language.</b> To the contrary, an isolating language uses independent words and in turn, the words lack internal structure. A <b>synthetic</b> <b>language</b> tends to employ affixes and internal modification of roots (i.e. free morphemes - Bases) for the same purpose of expressing additional meanings.|$|E

50|$|As {{formerly}} noted, junction grammar {{does not}} analyze or describe natural language {{with respect to}} formal, <b>synthetic</b> <b>languages</b> (whether separately or arranged in some hierarchy), but considers all of these to be ‘derivative’ {{in the sense that}} they themselves are defined with reference to one natural language or another. Junction grammar construes this dependency upon natural language to mean that natural language is itself the meta-language upon which all formal, <b>synthetic</b> <b>languages</b> (including all forms of mathematics and computer programming languages) supervene. From this it follows that to analyze the meta-language with derivative tools is circular and can yield no more in a particular case than the subset of the source which it circumscribes. For this reason, junction grammar holds that “natural language has its own math.” To discover the rudiments of this foundational math and expand upon it has been the objective of proponents since its inception.|$|R
