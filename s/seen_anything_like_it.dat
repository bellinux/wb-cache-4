500|$|Liverpool {{celebrated their}} victory by parading the trophy around Liverpool in an open-top {{double-decker}} bus {{the day after}} the final. They were cheered by approximately 1 million supporters, with an estimated 300,000 fans located around St George's Hall – the final destination of the parade. Business experts estimated that one in five workers took time off following the victory. It was also estimated that Liverpudlians drank around 10,000 bottles of champagne after the match, with supermarket chain Sainsbury's stating: [...] "We've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> We would usually expect to sell this much champagne at Christmas".|$|E
500|$|The next day, King Charles and {{his brother}} Henry {{took part in a}} tournament, leading teams dressed as British and Irish knights. The theme of the tournament, [...] "virtue and love", was {{represented}} by two chariots, one containing ladies dressed as the five virtues, the other carrying Venus and Cupid and many mini-cupids. In the tournament itself, little balls of fire were lobbed among the horses as they crossed. The royal grandstand was hung with gold-and-silk tapestries illustrating the triumph of Scipio, which Giulio Romano had designed for Francis I. Brantôme recalled in his memoirs that [...] "the Spanish lords and ladies greatly admired it, never having <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> in the possession of their king". Another French spectator recorded, [...] "Strangers of all nations were now forced to recognise that in these things France had surpassed, with these parades, bravado, glories and magnificences, all other nations and even herself".|$|E

500|$|In 1956, Gittings {{traveled}} to California {{on the advice}} of Donald Webster Cory, to visit the office of the new ONE, Inc., an early homophile organization that dedicated itself to providing support to homosexuals in the US. While in California, she met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who had co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in San Francisco. [...] "She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift and sandals. I remember she had this satchel, a backpack— I'd never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> Or her", Lyon remembered. At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional bisexual character, not even homosexual. [...] "Even then I was pretty assertive...What were they doing with a name like that? It wasn't very nice of me, but they seemed to take it with reasonably good spirits." ...|$|E
500|$|Dunn {{trained and}} rode his first World Grand Championship {{on the bay}} {{stallion}} Dark Spirit's Rebel. In 1991, the horse placed third in the competition. In 1992, the horse and rider pair won at most of the shows they had entered, including the World Grand Championship at that year's Celebration. Dunn had been training for 42 years at the time, and was 74 years old, making him the oldest trainer ever to win the class. The competition was held {{in front of a}} record crowd of 28,000. [...] "Rebel" [...] was the favorite horse going into the competition, out of a field of 13, and the team of Dunn and the stallion was described by the Florence TimesDaily as the [...] "most popular team in Celebration history". Dunn said after the win, [...] "I've been coming to the Celebration since 1950 and I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> That made it twice as good. It's nice to know that I've got that many friends and supporters." [...] The following year, Dark Spirit's Rebel was retired from competition in a formal ceremony at the Celebration. Dunn's riding number, 1865, was also retired.|$|E
500|$|In the United Kingdom, it {{is legal}} to possess a bat'leth on private property; however, they may be seized if they are {{considered}} to be [...] "potential evidence of a criminal lifestyle." [...] They are classed as weapons, which makes it illegal to carry one in a public place. A replica bat'leth was surrendered to Gloucestershire Constabulary as part of the 2006 knife amnesty in the UK. In 2008, a miniature bat'leth was seized in Oxford after a 17-year-old was caught trying to smuggle it into a College. Police described the weapon as [...] "most horrendous". The person was arrested and sentenced to six months in a young offenders' institution. In 2009, a man from Billingham, County Durham, was arrested for possession of a miniature bat'leth in a public street. In the court documents, it was referred to as a [...] "multi-bladed sword", and the judge said [...] "I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> in my life before." [...] The accused pleaded guilty at Teesside Crown Court, and he was later sentenced to thirteen weeks in prison. The court ordered that the bat'leth was to be forfeited and destroyed. A custom-made bat'leth was seized in 2009 in Accrington, Lancashire.|$|E

60|$|Alison, however, {{knew nothing}} of farming, {{and it was the}} house at which she gazed with most interest. It stood not far from a broad shallow lake with a thin birch bluff on one side of it, a commodious two-storied {{building}} with a wide veranda. It was apparently built of wood, but its severity of outline was relieved by gaily picked-out scroll-work and lattice shutters; and in front of the entrance somebody had attempted to make a garden. The stables and barns behind it were new frame buildings, and there were wire fences stretching back from these.

60|$|So he did it. He had {{a little}} wee bit of steamboating, and some stage-coaching, but {{all the rest of}} the way was horseback, and it took him three weeks to get to Washington. He saw lots of land and lots of villages and four cities. He was gone 'most eight weeks, and there never was such a proud man in the village as he when he got back. His travels made him the {{greatest}} man in all that region, and the most talked about; and people come from as much as thirty miles back in the country, and from over in the Illinois bottoms, too, just to look at him--and there they'd stand and gawk, and he'd gabble.

Castillo refused to give the ball to {{designated}} penalty kick-taker Cristiano Lucarelli and took the penalty himself, which was saved by the goalkeeper. Castillo was immediately substituted from the game.

Once you're inside you really can't tell where you are - what's north, south, east or west. The way it's designed, it's an interesting kind of setup," [...] Nolan said. [...] "Because of the high value of targets they have there – on a world scale, whether it be a drug cartel or terrorists – they are as concerned with someone trying to get in to break someone out as much as they are about inmates trying to escape. The protection around the prison is pretty remarkable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kimmel's biggest {{influences}} in comedy are David Letterman and Howard Stern.

[...] Kimmel has often joked that the only reason he got into show business was just so he can be friends with Letterman, he has also questioned why anybody would watch his show instead of Letterman's. Kimmel wrote a piece for Time writing his love for Letterman by saying, [...] "As I write this, there are only 10 shows left before the funniest, most inventive and smartest man who ever wore an Alka Seltzer suit goes fishing for good. None of us who discovered Dave on our own and claimed him as our own {{will ever be able to}} satisfactorily explain to the younger people who didn’t what he did, what he meant and what he means.

I never <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> so disgusting.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{reports that}} Jackson had {{suffered}} a cardiac arrest then that he had died came from the Los Angeles-based celebrity news website TMZ. Doctors at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center pronounced Jackson dead at 2:26p.m. and 18 minutes later, TMZ published the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson passed away today {{at the age of}} 50." [...] The Los Angeles Times confirmed the report at 2:51p.m. PDT (5:51p.m. EDT). The news spread quickly online, causing websites to slow down and crash from user overload. TMZ and the Los Angeles Times suffered outages. Google initially believed that the millions of search requests meant their search engine was under DDoS attack, and blocked searches related to Michael Jackson for 30 minutes. Twitter reported a crash, as did Wikipedia at [...] PDT (22:15 UTC). The Wikimedia Foundation reported nearly a million visitors to Jackson's biography within one hour, probably the most visitors in a one-hour period to any article in Wikipedia's history. AOL Instant Messenger collapsed for 40 minutes. AOL called it a [...] "seminal moment in internet history ... We've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> in terms of scope or depth." [...] Around 15% of Twitter posts (5,000 [...] per minute) mentioned Jackson after the news broke, compared to the 5% recalled as having mentioned the Iranian elections or the flu pandemic that had made headlines earlier in the year. Overall, web traffic ranged from 11% to at least 20% higher than normal. MTV and BET aired marathons of Jackson's music videos.|$|E

The performance incident made [...] "Janet Jackson" [...] the most searched term, event and image in Internet history. Jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records as [...] "Most Searched in Internet History" [...] and the [...] "Most Searched for News Item". It also broke the record for [...] "most searched event over one day". 'Janet Jackson' also became the most searched term and person for 2004 and also of the following year.

2500|$|When NBC {{announced}} its 198990 primetime schedule in May 1989, The Seinfeld Chronicles was not included, but {{supporters of the}} show didn't give up on it. The pilot first aired on July 5, 1989, and finished second in its time slot against the CBS police drama Jake and the Fatman, receiving a Nielsen rating of 10.9/19, meaning that the pilot was watched by 10.9% of American households, and that 19% of all TVs in use {{at the time were}} tuned into it. The ratings didn't exhibit regional skew that Tartikoff predicted, much to the encouragement of the show's supporters. Despite the poor test results, Ludwin cancelled one of the Bob Hope specials budgeted for that season so that the entertainment division had the money to order six more episodes of The Seinfeld Chronicles, which formed the rest of the show's first season, a move without which Chicago Tribune columnist Phil Rosenthal later stated there would be no Seinfeld. Although this was a very low order number for a new series (the smallest sitcom order in TV history), Castle Rock failed to find any other buyers when it shopped the show to other networks, and accepted the order. The show was renamed Seinfeld, but it wouldn't return to the airwaves until May 30, 1990, and it'd be another three years before it became a Top 5 ratings success. Preston Beckman, {{who was in charge of}} NBC's research department at the time, reminisced, [...] "The show was different. Nobody had <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> It wasn't unusual for poor-testing shows to get on the air, but it was very rare that they became hits." ...|$|E
