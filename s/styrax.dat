5|$|The main trade route {{leading into}} Han China passed first through Kashgar, yet Hellenized Bactria further west {{was the central}} node of {{international}} trade. By the 1st century AD, Bactria and much of Central Asia and North India were controlled by the Kushan Empire. Silk was the main export item from China to India. Indian merchants brought various goods to China, including tortoise shell, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, fine cloth, woolen textiles, perfume and incense, crystal sugar, pepper, ginger, salt, coral, pearls, glass items, and Roman wares. Indian merchants brought Roman <b>styrax</b> and frankincense to China, while the Chinese knew bdellium as a fragrant item from Persia, although it was native to West India. The tall Ferghana horses imported from Fergana were highly prized in Han China. The newly introduced exotic Central Asian grapes (i.e. vitis vinifera) were used to make grape wine, although the Chinese had rice wine before this. Glass luxury items from ancient Mesopotamia {{have been found in}} Chinese tombs and dated to the late Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC). Roman glasswares have been found in Chinese tombs dating to the early 1st century BC, with the earliest specimen found at the southern Chinese seaport of Guangzhou. Silverwares from Roman- and Arsacid territories have also been found at Han tomb sites.|$|E
25|$|The {{components}} {{are still being}} studied and are not determined with absolute certainty. Stacte is variously described as being the extract of the transparent portion of the myrrh resin which exudes spontaneously from the tree, or a balsam from a tree such as opobalsamum or a <b>styrax.</b> Onycha, which in Greek means “nail,” is variously described as being the operculum from a shell found in the Red Sea (which are said to resemble a fingernail), the exudation from the rock rose bush called labdanum (both petals and markings which are said to resemble a fingernail), <b>Styrax</b> benzoin, bdellium, or even cloves. Galbanum is {{generally considered to be}} Ferula galbaniflua. Also considered is a milder variety from the Levant or possibly even a close relative of Ferula galbaniflua called narthex (or giant fennel). Pure frankincense is the resin of a tree of the boswellia species.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known published {{record of}} Liquidambar styraciflua is {{in a work}} by Spanish naturalist Francisco Hernández published posthumously in 1615, in which he describes the species as a large tree producing a fragrant gum resembling liquid amber, whence the genus name Liquidambar. In John Ray's Historia Plantarum (1686) it is called <b>Styrax</b> liquida. However, the first mention of any use of the amber is described by Juan de Grijalva, the nephew of the Govorner of Cuba, in the year 1517.|$|E
500|$|Incense: According to David Michael Stoddart, [...] "the {{earliest}} recorded use {{of incense}} {{comes from the}} Chinese who burned various herbs and plant products." [...] Sandalwood, casia, <b>styrax,</b> and cinnamon were used by the Chinese.|$|E
2500|$|This plant's genus name Liquidambar {{was first}} given by Linnaeus in 1753 from [...] liquidus, fluid, and the Arabic ambar, amber, in {{allusion to the}} {{fragrant}} terebinthine juice or gum which exudes from the tree. Its specific epithet styraciflua is an old generic name meaning [...] "flowing with storax" [...] (a plant resin). The name [...] "storax" [...] has long been confusingly applied to the aromatic gum or resin of this species, that of L.orientalis of Turkey, and to the resin better known as benzoin from various tropical trees in the genus <b>Styrax.</b>|$|E

50|$|There are {{two common}} kinds of benzoin, benzoin Siam and benzoin Sumatra. Benzoin Siam is {{obtained}} from <b>Styrax</b> tonkinensis, found across Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Benzoin Sumatra is obtained from <b>Styrax</b> benzoin, which grows predominantly {{on the island}} of Sumatra. Unlike Siamese benzoin, Sumatran benzoin contains cinnamic acid in addition to benzoic acid. In the United States, Sumatra benzoin (<b>Styrax</b> benzoin and <b>Styrax</b> paralleoneurus) is more customarily used in pharmaceutical preparations, Siam benzoin (<b>Styrax</b> tonkinensis et al.) in the flavor and fragrance industries.|$|E

50|$|Many {{scholars}} cite <b>Styrax</b> officinalis as {{the biblical}} storax, however the yield of resin produced by S. officinalis, if any is produced at all, is extremely small. The {{large amounts of}} stacte needed for liturgical purposes, especially in the first temple period, {{would seem to have}} necessitated the import of a storax that could have met the demand. <b>Styrax</b> benzoin yields a much larger yield of resin and could fill this need quite adequately. As mentioned above, <b>Styrax</b> benzoin is a close relative of and of the same genus as <b>Styrax</b> officinalis.Herodotus of Halicarnassus in the 5th century BC indicates that different kinds of storax were traded. Gamaliel said that stacte was nothing more than the sap that drips from the branches of the balsam tree. Balsam is a term that has been used for a variety of pleasantly scented vegetable gums that usually contain benzoic acid such as is contained in gum benzoin from the gum benzoin tree.|$|E
