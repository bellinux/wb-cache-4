40|$|In recent years, {{questions}} regarding economic inequalities have attracted {{an increasing number}} of research in the field on interdisciplinary social sciences. However, not enough attention has yet been paid for understanding the perceptions of economic inequalities and, particularly, the perceived size of inequalities in the society. The central research question set in this analysis explores how the magnitude of economic inequality is perceived in European Union Member states and how possible variation in these perceptions can be explained. Seven theory-based hypotheses are formulated in order to test both individual and contextual country-level effects on perceived magnitude of inequality. Assumed explanations at individual level include different demographic characteristics, subjective social status, expectations towards social mobility and attitudes towards welfare state. Marco level factors, included in formulated hypotheses, consider selected macroeconomic parameters, post-Soviet heritage and typology of welfare regimes. <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>survey</b> data (81. 5) is chosen as the primary data set for statistical analysis. The designed methodological approach combines multiple and multilevel regression modelling in assessing explanatory capacity of chosen micro and macro-level indicators. The results yield for diverse explanation of perceived magnitude of economic inequality, including both individual and contextual country-level factors. Findings also reveal that personal believes and attitudes carry the largest part in overall explanatory capacity of the presented research model. More specifically, lower self-placement in society, negative expectations of future social mobility and higher support for welfare state prove to be the most significant explanatory factors for amplified perceptions of inequality magnitude...|$|E
40|$|The European Parliament is {{the only}} source of direct {{legitimacy}} of the European Union, as it {{is the only}} body directly elected by the citizens. Politics within the European Parliament has increasingly grown in importance, as its powers expanded progressively with each European Union treaty. The opposite happened with voter turnout. This paper builds on the idea that the European elections are perceived as less important by the voters’ parties and the media, and are in general characterized by a lower electoral participation with respect to National elections. We analyze turnout from two perspectives: individual and aggregate level. Individual electoral models are estimated using data from the European Social Survey and <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>Survey,</b> referring at electoral turnout at National and Supranational level, respectively. From an individual level perspective, we test if unequal participation exists concerning socioeconomic categories across “firstorder” National elections and “second-order” European elections in order to understand if a potential representation bias might exist. Empirical evidence highlights that inequality in participation exists only for the European Parliament elections. From the aggregate level side, an original panel data is used {{in order to understand the}} turnout gap across elections and test the “second-order” theory concerning the European Parliament elections as an opportunity to contest governing parties. Evidence shows that a vote share gap across the two election types exists, and that large as well as extremist and parties from European Monetary Union Member States lose votes across elections. Being an EMU member as well as being a net-payer at the European Union budget increases the electoral gap...|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. In October 2001, the European Commission launched {{a new series of}} surveys in the 13 countries that are applying for European Union (EU) membership under the heading Candidate Countries Eurobarometer (CC-EB). Initially named Applicant Countries Eurobarometer or AC-EB, the surveys were ordered and co-ordinated by the Directorate-General for Press and Communication (Public Opinion Analysis). The CC-EB surveys are carried out in Bulgaria, Republic of Cyprus (with a separate Northern Cyprus survey parallel to 2002. 2), Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Turkey. After a four year gap they are replacing the former Central and Eastern <b>Eurobarometer.</b> A pilot <b>survey</b> was conducted for test purposes in winter 1999 / 2000. After the EU enlargement in May 2004, the CC-EB series became part of the <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer,</b> intermittently also including the remaining candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Croatia and Northern Cyprus. Candidate Countries Eurobarometer gathers information from the societies which are applying to become members of the EU {{in a way that is}} comparable with the <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer.</b> Also the methodology used is almost identical to that of the <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer.</b> Every <b>survey</b> is carried out on national representative samples of around 1, 000 respondents (realised interviews) aged 15 and over in each country, except Malta and Cyprus, where the samples are of 500 respondents, using face-to-face interviewing at the respondent's home. The national samples reflect the structure of population aged 15 + in terms of gender, age, regions of a country, settlement size, education level, and marital status. In each of the 13 candidate countries, the surveys are carried out by national institutes associated with and co-ordinated by the Hungarian office of The Gallup Organization in Budapest and Gallup Europe in Brussels. A large selection of <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>Survey</b> Series datasets, including <b>standard</b> <b>Eurobarometers,</b> Central and Eastern Eurobarometers and Candidate Countries Eurobarometers, are available to browse, analyse and download online via Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Data Archive for the Social Sciences' (GESIS) ZACAT service. Data analysis and downloading require online registration with ZACAT and there is no restriction upon who can register. GESIS was formed in 2007 when three independent institutes merged (Social Science Information Centre (IZ) in Bonn, Central Archive for Empirical Social Research in Cologne (ZA), and Centre for Survey Research and Methodology (ZUMA) in Mannheim).

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to {{the debate on the}} role and efficacy of pension portability regimes in ensuring both a fair treatment of workers and neutrality as regards to labour mobility choices. Drawing on important contributions from the literature, I perform a comprehensive analysis that aims {{to bridge the gap between}} the economic and the political analyses of portability. In addition, I also present novel and unprecedented empirical insights on portability’s effects in the labour market. The thesis is comprised of an opening, introductory section followed by four main Chapters (from 2 to 5). Chapter 2 is devoted to a theoretical and empirical analysis of labour mobility. Two main practices are primarily discussed: international and occupational mobility. Then, the issue of pension portability is described and examined in detail in Chapter 3. In this section, focusing on the European Union, I survey the current legal framework for the portability of both mandatory public and private pension rights. While this analysis focuses on the current situation, I also review the historical evolution of rules and practices. This examination is complemented by a simulation exercise estimating possible pension entitlements for a representative worker accumulating pension rights in different EU countries. The simulations are performed using real parameters of national pension systems and are based on empirical assumptions. Overall, Chapter 3 offers therefore a very thorough analysis of portability regimes: both from a normative and an economic (i. e., costs vs. benefits) perspective. Chapters 4 and 5 contain two key empirical analyses in this dissertation. Chapter 4 focuses on the portability of complementary pension rights in Italy when job mobility occurs voluntarily across employers, but not across countries. Using micro-data from the Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW), I examine whether coverage from an occupational pension plan has discouraged job mobility in Italy between 1998 and 2010. Such an effect has been documented to occur in other countries, especially the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. However, there has never been a similar examination for the case of Italy. My analysis provide very weak or no effect of pension portability losses impacting on labour mobility decisions. There is, on the contrary, some evidence that pension-covered jobs are better jobs overall, for the ample set of benefits they offer to workers and of which the pension plan is only an element. For this reason, mobility out of these positions is less convenient and thus frequent. Finally, Chapter 5 examines whether past difficulties in portability transfers affect the propensity for future international mobility. This is a unique research question that has not been studied in the literature so far. Specifically, I test the hypothesis that a positive experience of portability encourages people to consider further opportunities of mobility abroad, whereas negative experiences are likely to lower such interest. Both these effects are tested and estimated empirically using data from the <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>Survey</b> No. 75. 1 (2011), covering 27 EU member states. I find that that easy portability in the past increases the propensity for job mobility abroad in comparison to people with no prior portability experience. On the contrary, difficult experiences slightly depress the propensity for mobility...|$|E

The <b>Eurobarometer</b> (EB) <b>survey</b> series is a unique programme of cross-national and cross-temporal comparative social science research. Since the early seventies representative national samples in all European Union (EU) (formerly the European Community (EC)) member states have been simultaneously interviewed {{in the spring and}} autumn of each year. Starting with EB 34. 1 (autumn 1990), separate supplementary surveys on special issues have been conducted under almost every EB number. The EB is designed to provide regular monitoring of public social and political attitudes in the EU through specific trend questions. More information about the series may be found on the Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Data Archive for the Social Sciences (GESIS) <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>Survey</b> Series web pages. GESIS was formed in 2007 when three independent institutes merged (Social Science Information Centre (IZ) in Bonn, Central Archive for Empirical Social Research in Cologne (ZA), and Centre for Survey Research and Methodology (ZUMA) in Mannheim). Users should note that earlier EBs are available from GESIS. Background Work on European survey series began in early 1970, when the Commission of the European Community sponsored simultaneous surveys of the EC. These surveys were designed to measure public awareness of, and attitudes toward, the Common Market and other EC institutions, in complementary fashion. They also probed the goals given top priority for each respondent's nation. These concerns have remained a central part of the EC's research efforts - which were carried forward in the summer of 1971 with another six-nation survey that gave special attention to agricultural problems. The nine EC member countries were then surveyed again on the same topic areas in September 1973. After 1973, the surveys took on a somewhat broader scope in content as well as in geographical coverage, with measures of subjective satisfaction and the perceived quality of life becoming standard features of the EC public opinion surveys. Over time, the member states of the EC/EU have increased in number, and the coverage of the EB surveys has widened accordingly. In 1974, nine countries were surveyed: France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg. Greece has been included since the autumn 1980 survey (EB 14) onwards, Portugal and Spain since autumn 1985 (EB 24), the former German Democratic Republic since autumn 1990 (EB 34), Finland since the spring of 1993 (EB 39), and Sweden and Austria since the autumn of 1994 (EB 42). Norway has been included in some surveys since 1991, from EB 36 onwards. In 2004, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia joined the EU, and in 2007, Bulgaria and Romania (some of these countries participated in the Candidate Countries <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>survey</b> series (see under GN 33343) before full accession). Candidate countries of Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Iceland have also been included in selected surveys. Some surveys are also conducted in Turkey, and in the Turkish Cypriot Community (Northern Cyprus).
