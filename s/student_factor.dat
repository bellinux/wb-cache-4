The two objectives in using the latent transition analysis with a mixture Rasch (item response theory) measurement model (LTA-MRM) are a) to study the three time measures of latent mathematic achievements and their transitions including the probability of those three transitions, and b) to {{study the effects of}} the dynamic <b>student</b> <b>factors</b> measuring 3 times on the student latent mathematic achievements and latent transitions. This study employs the <b>student</b> <b>factors,</b> consisting of types and duration of activities, as independent variables and the the latent transition analysis results, consisting of the latent mathematic achievement and latent transition, as dependent variables. The three sets of reliable and valid multiple choice tests are administered to the sample consisting of 217 grade 7, 8 and 9 students, Chulalongkorn University Demonstration Secondary School, and the Mplus computer program is used to estimate the LTA-MRM.

Samples consisted of: (1) 750 student dissertations in the humanities and social sciences and (2) 753 questionnaire responses consisting of 633 students, 108 dissertation advisors, and 12 senior administrators in the participating institutions. A 5 -point rating dissertation evaluation scale was developed for use by the researcher and her assistants. Three sets of a dissertation attribution questionnaire used by the students, advisors, and senior administrators were also developed and administered. Descriptive statistics were used with the 5 -point rating data. The 3 -level HLM package was used to analyze the quality, value-added model of the dissertations.

This study measured character education performance outcomes by comparing the survey results and record reviews of high school students before and after the implementation of a CEP. Over 300 students in grades 9 - 12 completed the presurvey, and over 300 participants completed the follow-up character education profile. Follow-up participants have taken part in a CEP for two years, prior to completion of the School as a Caring Community Profile. Performance outcomes were measured based on three factors.

40|$|The {{premise of}} this {{research}} is on the theoretical assumptions that teachers ’ mental constructs can have significant pedagogical consequences (Clark and Peterson, 1986). It is necessary to describe the thinking and planning strategies so that one can fully understand classroom processes. National Institute of Education or NIE (1975 a) cited in Clark and Peterson (1986) proposed a rationale for a program of research on teachers’ thoughts and processes. They assert that innovation in the contexts, practices and technology of teaching be mediated through the minds and motives of teachers. As teachers are able to understand and observe (thought processes) classroom behavior, student’s cognitive processes, students ’ level of capability and ability and students ’ inert interest and motivation, they can steer and adjust the classroom learning process according {{to the needs of the}} students. The success of any learning and teaching situation will depend a great deal on the teachers (Safiah Osman, 1992). Improving the ability of students to understand what they read is a never-ending process. Based on the theoretical premise and the consensus of views of other researchers, teachers ’ thought processes have significant pedagogical consequences. The purpose {{of this research}} is to investigate systematically and empirically the teachers ’ level of belief, background knowledge, attitude and perception towards literature and literature teaching, the extent of the influence of <b>student</b> <b>factor</b> and evaluation factor on literature teaching, the forms of teaching; student centered or teacher centered...|$|E

Young subjects have consistently outperformed older subjects on tests of recall of standard laboratory word-lists. Young subjects in memory studies have typically been chosen from university classes while older subjects have been chosen from any number of community settings. It is hypothesized {{that the difference between}} student and non-student, rather than any age factor, may more accurately explain the decrement found in memory performance. The effect of that <b>student</b> <b>factor</b> was examined using four groups of women. Group 1, students ages 18 to 25; Group 2, students ages 40 to 65; Group 3, non-students ages 30 to 35; and Group 4, non- students ages 40 to 65. Three memory tests were used: an intentional memory task, an incidental memory task and a recognition memory task. Intentional recall and recognition memory showed a significant group effect with the middle-aged student group performing significantly better than any other group; the young students then performed significantly better than the two non-student groups; and there was little difference between the two non-student groups. For incidental memory, there was a significant effect noted between the student and non-student factor; however, the group effect was not significant. The results {{of this study indicate that}} recognizing a "student factor" is much more important to memory research than has been credited in the past.

This study sampled twelfth grade students from randomly selected high schools in the Williamette Valley of Oregon. The stepwise regression analysis was used to select the most significant <b>factors</b> influencing <b>student</b> learning of economics. The dependent variable was economics learning. The independent variables were <b>student</b> <b>factors</b> and instructional factors. The dependent variables were measured by the difference between pretest and posttest on the Test of Economic Literacy (TEL). The independent variables were measured by information students and teachers were asked to give on their respective questionnaires. A two-stage sampling technique was utilized to select the sample. Six Willamette Valley high schools, selected at random, participated. The subsampling unit included 113 male and 106 female senior students. All were enrolled in economics courses at the randomly selected high schools. Data were also collected from the six teachers, one per high school, instructing the students in economics. Three models of economic education were developed: (1) a student model using <b>student</b> <b>factors</b> alone, based on student grade point average (GPA) and socioeconomic status (SES); (2) a student model using only instructional factors, based on previous economics courses taken by teacher (EET); and (3) a model using all variables, based on EET and GPA. This study showed that EET was more powerful than GPA in economics learning. Considering the importance of the findings of this study, it is suggested that replication should be conducted, using large samples and more variables. Research is needed which deals with the number of economics courses and level of Economics courses appropriate for economics teacher preparation. Research is also needed which shows the impact of economics on cognitive development attainment and the comparative study on different teaching methods in economics.

We found meaningful gender-specific differences in students’ motives for the profession and expectations as to the curriculum, and gender differences in the way students experience and assess the curriculum offered.
