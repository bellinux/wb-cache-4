40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{members of}} the Ivory Shell genus Babylonia Schlüter, 1838, {{belonging}} to the Buccinidae, are characterized by more or less slender buccinoid shells, mostly ornamented with a beautiful colour-pattern. Some species, e. g. the type species B. spirata, have a conspicuous sutural canal (<b>see</b> <b>pl.</b> 8 figs. 1 - 3), resembling the spirally arranged staircase of the Babylonian Tower in certain old pictures (pl. 6 fig. 1). Some of the species are found in many collections, others are rarely seen. A l l Recent {{members of the}} genus are restricted to the Indo-Pacific region. The fossil Babylonia species are found in a more extensive area, including southern and central Europe. The Recent species have been treated in the well known iconographies of the nineteenth century. Much later a short revision was given by Habe (1965), followed by comments on some species by Altena (1968). It should be emphasized that we have concentrated on the Recent species in this monograph. Far less original {{research has been done}} on fossil taxa; many data have simply been taken from the literature here...|$|E
40|$|In {{the bay of}} Emmahaven near Padang (W. Sumatra) is a small coral reef. On the North side of this reef a small, sandy island occurs called Pasir Ketjil. It {{has lately}} been {{surrounded}} by brick walls, besides which a stone pier has been built in a S. W. direction (cf. fig. 1, a map of 1899 and fig. 2 and 3, the present condition). Since the building of that pier, coral sand has accumulated against it on the S-side. This reef lacks shingle ramparts. From this situation of the sandy island {{with regard to the}} reef, and from the placing of the younger coral sand accumulations (A in fig. 3), it may be concluded that the maximal wind-effect is strongest {{from the direction of the}} open sea, about S. W. Data about the wind frequency kindly supplied by the director of the Kon. Magn. Meteor. Observatorium at Batavia are given on p. 13. From these data have been derived the average wind frequencies per year (p. 15) recorded for 6, 9, 15 and 22 O'clock. The proportions of these data may be seen in the graphs fig. 4, 5, 6 and fig. 7. The monsoons do not occur in the coastal plain of Padang. The wind system in Padang is entirely dominated by land and sea wind but the sea wind is always stronger than the landwind so that it may safely be assumed that the direction of the wind of 9 and 15 O'clock predominates (maximal wind-effect). So it appears to have been the wind effect of the seawind, i. e. the product of the wind frequency given above and the velocity of the wind, about which we lack detailed data here, which we have recognised in the structure and situation of Pasir Ketjil (cf. fig. 2 and 3 with fig. 5 and 6). Although the frequency of the land wind is rather great (fig. 4 and fig. 7) its strength must be very little, for in the structure of Pasir Ketjil no influence, that can be assigned to the land wind, is apparent. We find here at the same time a confirmation of the conclusion we drew some time ago, namely that: data on the wind-frequency only (the prodominant direction of the wind) may sometimes give an indication as to the probable wind effect, but only when the wind in question is not obstructed by mountains. Finally the year-averages of the wind-frequencies of land- and seawind have been taken together in the graph fig. 8. So the part on the right side of the N. S. axis (landwind) can be practically ignored for geological considerations. The structure of the island Poeloe Pasir concurs with that of Pasir Ketjil. Along the coast of Emmahaven occur old and sligthly raised coral limestones. On plate 4 a section of this fossil reef is represented (equal scale for length and height) based on 15 seperate bore-holes; the data have been published by professor Sluiter. From this valuable section we may gather the following particulars: I. The reef has not grown on a rocky volcanic substratum or against the andesitic coastal lavas, but rests entirely on the muddy bottom of the bay, as is also the case with the reefs in he Bay of Batavia, the Thousand-Islands, and the Spermonde Archipelago. II. On the silty bottom rests a layer wherein mud and coral débris have been found. This shows that, in the innitial stage, only a few, branched coral species could grow while the vigorous sedimentation of silt was going on. III. These branched corals gradually attained to larger numbers and formed the basis for the actual, more cohesive reef, which was recognised in the drillings as „coral débris, branched type. ” Just as with the reef near Krakatoa (bibl. 5) which grew under the unfavourable influence of strong sedimentation, and with the fossil corals of the Domaring and Menkrawit layers of E. Borneo, which grew under similar circumstances, we see here also that the branched types of growth (unfortunately we are not able to furnish a statement of genera in this case) are the pioneers. In the later, further stages of development of the reef, it is these types again that grow on the outside of the reef (see section of bore holes 9 — 12). IV. Only in the older stage of development of the reef, bigger globular coral growths appear by the side of the branched varieties. This is again shown by a different indication in the section. V. Later on, to all probability the reef was then already dead and „raised”, hill side waste has fallen over it (section of bore hole 3 and 4). VI. For the sake of clearness I have circumscribed the real, more compact reef with a thick line. Thus it is clearly shown that the basis of the reef, especially in the centre, lies deeper than the adjacent bottom of the bay. Sluiter has tried so explain this by supposing that the reef, when once it was growing into a compact mass has, to a certain extent, gradually sunk into the bottom of the bay. The same phenomenon was noticed while drilling on small islands in the bay of Batavia (bibl. 2). Incidentally I have already pointed out that: „this may be caused „for a large part by aggradation of the bottom as the rivers always „bring a large quantity of silt into the bay. ” (bibl. 3, pag. 40). In reality sinking of the reef as well as aggradation of the bottom by a supply of silt in the bay, have probably taken place. Judging from the available data it does not seem possible to me to ascertain the extent of their respective influences. But, the configuration between bore-holes 12 — 14 and 3 — 5 of the section given here, as well as the structure and the situation of the island Edam in the bay of Batavia (see bibl. 2, fig. 3) seem to me to point to a real sinking of the reef into the soft bottom. The opportunity to pay a short visit by motor launch to the neighbouring island Poeloe Pisang (besar 1)) happened to present itself (see fig. 9). Against a nucleus of volcanic rock there is, at the South and East side, a plateau of coral limestone bordering on the sea. Part of this limestone has disappeared, probably, in consequence of the marine erosion. In this way a wave-cut rock bench has developed, which, however, is still situated above the normal low-water mark (see section fig. 10). At high tide sea covers this rock bench; the line to which the water then extends is marked by a „storm” rampart of fine white coral shingle. In this area there occur also erosion canals, simmilar to those of Tji Laoet Eureun (S. coast of Java) described at length by Dr. J. Cosijn and the present writer (bibl. 8). <b>See</b> <b>Pl.</b> 2, fig. 13 (breakers in the distance). If we suppose that the reef had originally grown to the level of normal low-water mark, then it follows from the present situation that the amount, either of the sinking of the level of the sea or of the rise of the level of the land, must have been between 3 and 5 metres. The exact determination of this amount was not possible because at the spot where it could have been ascertained best i. e. close to the nucleus of the island, observation was obstructed by débris that had fallen down. We are brought to a simmilar conclusion in Emmahaven itself where in some places (<b>see</b> <b>Pl.</b> 3, fig. 14) effects of abrasion are still to be seen above the present level of the sea. So these observations again support Daly's theory of a recent world wide sinking of the ocean-level...|$|E

30|$|In {{the case}} of the GaAsSb CL, a blueshift and a {{moderate}} PL enhancement is observed with increasing growth rate (Figure  4 b), also indicative of a lower Sb incorporation. This behavior contradicts that reported for GaAsSb QWs grown at growth rates below 1 ML s− 1 [24], but no reports for higher growth rates are available in the literature. Like in {{the case of}} the GaAsN CL, a third sample was grown to decouple the effect of the growth rate and the Sb concentration. This sample (E 3, dashed black line in Figure  4 b) had a lower Sb content to match that of E 2 (similar PL peak energy) and a 1 -ML s− 1 CL growth rate. Contrary to the case of GaAsN, increasing the growth rate while maintaining the Sb content constant seems to produce a minimum improvement of the <b>PL</b> (<b>see</b> the <b>PLs</b> from E 2 and E 3 in Figure  4 b). Thus, we can conclude the sole increase of the growth rate (samples E 1 and E 2) leads to a decreased Sb content that is entirely responsible for the improved PL. Indeed, it has been shown that the PL of GaAsSb-capped InAs QDs is degraded for Sb contents above 12 % [27], so reducing the initial content (approximately 15 %) should result in an improved PL.|$|R

In the low-temperature regime below 150 K, the PL intensity is almost constant. The intensity increases toward 200 K and peaks at a maximum around 250 K.

Thus {{there is a need}} to explore the ecotoxicity of bio-pesticides and mostly their impact on soil microbes which is largely unknown. The effect of Quillajia saponaria plant extract (QLAgri (R)) and Paecilomyces lilacinus strain 251 (PL 251, BIOACT (R)) on the microbial community was investigated comparatively to the synthetic nematicides oxamyl and fluensulfone. Particular attention was given to potential effects on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA). No effect of QLAgri (R), oxamyl and fluensulfone on the soil microbial community and AOB/AOA was observed. In contrast BIOACT (R) stimulated the growth of copiotrophic Gram negative bacteria and fungi as determined by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis. Terminal restriction fragments length polymorphism (TRFLP) and qPCR analysis of the amoA gene showed a significant time-dependent inhibitory effect of BIOACT (R) on the abundance of AOB/AOA up to 20 days post application. Further qPCR analysis indicated that PL 251 did not proliferate in soil. These results suggested the establishment of complex interactions between BIOACT (R) and AOB/AOA which were further explored. In a follow-up study BIOACT (R) and its co-formulants, glucose (78 %) and skimmed milk powder (6 %), both induced a transient inhibitory effect on potential nitrification and abundance of AOB/AOA, whereas no effect was <b>seen</b> when <b>PL</b> 251 spores were used. Overall, our data suggest that the transient effect of BIOACT (R) on nitrifiers was the result of a competitive exclusion by copiotrophic microorganisms feeding on co-formulants rather than a direct toxicity effect.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to understand how customers perceive their logistics service providers in terms of achieving the claimed benefits of outsourcing. This paper is based on research focusing {{on the state of the}} 3 PL (Third Party Logistics) industry in Australia. Design/methodology/approach - A set of typical business outcomes to which logistics outsourcing is expected to contribute were identified. Customers were asked to rate the contribution of their principal 3 PL to these performance indicators. We used competitive priorities of 3 PLs, the services provided by them and technologies used by them as predictors and performed regression analysis for each of these. Findings - The results indicate that customers of 3 PLs place significant value on the services they provide, technologies they use and objectives that transcend just low cost. The implication of this final finding shows that customers see a focus on service based solutions as providing a set of benefits beyond mere cost control. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of this paper is that it is confined to Australia. So, any extensions of the findings to other regions of the world should be done with caution. Practical implications - The practical implication of the study is that it provides support for the potential for an effective set of arrangements with 3 PLs to help organizations to move out of the world of pure cost based competition, and into one where they could compete on multiple dimensions. Originality/value - This study provides evidence from customers of logistics service providers indicating that 3 PLs provide them with a means for competing through greater flexibility, at the same time as enabling better-cost management.

Features due to the QDs, bi-dimensional platelets (2 DP) and InAs wetting layer (WL) were identified in photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the as-grown sample. It is shown, using transmission electron microscopy, that RTA at temperature up to 700 degreesC (for 30 s) results in an increase of QDs lateral sizes. After RTA at 800 degreesC or higher temperatures, no QDs can be distinguished and substantial thickening of the WL can be <b>seen.</b> The main <b>PL</b> peak blueshifts {{as a result of}} RTA in all investigated temperature ranges, which is accompanied by a quenching of the 2 DP and WL PL. It is proposed that the main PL peak, which is due to the QDs in the as-grown sample, results from optical recombination in the modified WL in the samples, after RTA at 800 degreesC and higher temperatures. Laterally- enhanced Ga/In interdiffusion induced by strain is proposed to explain a relatively fast dissolution of QDs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|It is {{well known}} that the optical {{properties}} of ZnO nanostructures are crucially dependent on their morphology. In addition, the optical properties of ZnO nanostructures would be improved due to surface passivation effects of polymer surfactants [27, 28]. Thus, the PL measurements were performed to evaluate the optical quality of the obtained ZnO nanostructures, and the corresponding results were shown in Figure  6 d. It can be <b>seen</b> that the <b>PL</b> spectrum of the ZnO nanorods grown with no surfactant exhibits a dominant UV emission at 377 nm, along with a weak visible emission around 520 nm. Generally, the UV emission is due to the near-band edge (NBE) emission of ZnO, and the visible emission can be attributed to intrinsic defects such as oxygen vacancies [29, 30]. For the ZnO nanoneedles or platelets, grown with the addition of PEI or sodium citrate, the PL spectrum presents a unique UV emission (377 nm), but the defect-related visible emission is suppressed, which is attributed to the surface passivation effects of surfactants via the adsorption in different crystal faces and modification of the surface free energy. Furthermore, the intensity of NBE emission varies greatly with the morphology of ZnO nanostructures (nanorods, nanoneedles, or nanoplatelets), demonstrating that the photoluminescence property of ZnO nanostructures is adjusted by introducing different surfactants.|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{growth of}} China's economic, trend of {{globalisation}} and {{entry into the}} WTO have brought {{a significant impact on}} China's logistics. To meet fast growing market of logistic, China has made substantial progress. One of great improvement is regulatory reform to remove discrimination against foreign logistics companies. In addition, substantial investments in infrastructure will improve the service of logistics. Foreign third party logistics (3 PL) providers have achieved an unsubstituted position in China's logistics market with its own advantages and characters. New situation will <b>see</b> foreign 3 <b>PL</b> providers carrying out growth and development in China. This research aims to identify perception of foreign 3 PL providers in China. A series of questions evaluating company services and activities are duly introduced and investigated by an e-mail questionnaire survey. It intends to figure out current situation of foreign 3 PL providers in China and their comments towards some problems of China's logistics market. On a basis of the results and findings of survey, it makes discussion and g 1 ves recommendation to foreign 3 PL providers for their future development in China. As a contribution made to the study in the scope of third party logistics, this research introduces the conceptual development of 3 PL provider, the reasons of outsourcing logistics and the usage of 3 PL in different countries, which build up a foundation to investigate and study the service and function of foreign 3 PL providers in China...|$|R
