At approximately 9:45a.m. EDT (13:45 UTC), he then crossed the campus to Norris Hall, a classroom building on the campus where, in a span of nine minutes, Cho shot dozens of people, killing 30 of them. As police breached the area of the building where Cho attacked the faculty and <b>students,</b> <b>Cho</b> committed suicide in Norris 211 with a gunshot to his temple. Cho's gunshot wound destroyed his face, obscuring identification of his body for several hours. The police identified Cho by matching the fingerprints on the guns used in the shootings with immigration records.

Although police had not stated positively at the time of the initial investigation that Cho was the perpetrator of the Norris Hall shootings and the earlier one at West Ambler Johnston Hall, forensic evidence confirmed that the same gun was used in both shooting incidents.|$|E

He became a professional in 1963 when he was 15. His dan rank grew quickly because of the Oteai. He would go up the ranks faster than rules allowed after winning the first 14 Oteai games when he was being promoted from 6 to 7 dan. He reached 9 dan in 11 years, faster than most other players do. Ishida was given the nickname [...] "The Computer" [...] because his Yose play and counting skills were far more accurate than other pros.|$|E

Eide stated that Cho then visited her room to see if she was [...] "cool", adding that Cho remarked that he only found [...] "promiscuity in her eyes". Eide added that, when Cho visited the female <b>student,</b> <b>Cho</b> said, [...] "Hi, I'm Question Mark" [...] to her, [...] "which really freaked her out." [...] The female student called the campus police, complaining that Cho had sent her annoying messages and made an unannounced visit to her room.

The murder was {{investigated}} in 1997 by CID Agents J. Choi, D. Zeliff, T. Barnes and B. Crow. Two troubled U.S. teenagers—Arthur Patterson (the son of a former U.S. Army officer and Korean mother) and Edward Lee—became suspects and were convicted. Patterson was released a year later in a special amnesty and Lee was freed a year after that due to lack of evidence. The case never resulted in further convictions. http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/10/11/2011101101121.html It stars Jang Keun-suk as Arthur Patterson and Jung Jin-young as his lawyer.

50|$|Lee Chang-ho (이창호; born 29 July 1975 in Jeonju, North Jeolla) is a South Korean {{professional}} Go {{player of}} 9-dan rank. He is regarded {{by many as}} the best Go player in late 1990s and early 2000s. He was a <b>student</b> of <b>Cho</b> Hun-hyun 9-dan. He is the second youngest (11 years 1 months) to become a professional Go player in South Korean history behind Cho Hun-hyun (9 years 7 months). He is the only player to have won all eight international competitions at least once.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was said}} by Lee's first teacher {{that he would}} always try to play brilliantly. That was until he became <b>Cho</b> Hunhyun's <b>student.</b> <b>Cho</b> did not think Lee's talent was of a high level, as he could not even re-create a game he played against Cho. Lee fell short of {{expectations}} in Cho's assessment. Although {{he did not have}} the conventional wisdom of a Go genius, his deep reading and study abilities were at a different level. Lee stopped his attempts at playing brilliant moves and started playing more [...] "common" [...] moves instead. Lee often toys with opponents by playing a normal move that would help him read moves ahead, rather than a brilliant move where he could not read ahead as well. It has been said that Lee's style of play in his early career was to only beat his teacher. He was not as effective against other top players as he was against his teacher. This is one of the reasons why he was underestimated so much by other players, such as Cho Chikun. His playing style would go on to be effective against anyone. Instead of adopting the style of his teacher's natural brilliance and quick thinking, he chose magnificent calculation and deep reading. Many are still unimpressed by Lee's style of Go, as it seems too simple.|$|R

40|$|This {{introduction}} {{examines the}} four {{articles in this}} cluster on LatCrit praxis. The four articles {{can be seen as}} case studies that explore different aspects of LatCrit praxis. Pedro Malavet examines the role literature and the arts can play as a form of antisubordinationist practice. Nicholas Gunia focuses on Jamaican music as a particular site of antisubordinationist practice, showing us that resistance comes in many forms and that LatCrit practitioners must have a broad theory for social change that is not limited to legislatures, courtrooms, classrooms, and law reviews. Alfredo Mirande Gonzalez employs personal narrative to tell us how he used narratives in his classroom to better prepare students to work with subordinated groups. In doing so, he presents, obliquely, a pedagogical model for training law <b>students.</b> Sumi <b>Cho</b> and Robert Westley present a case study of U. C. Berkeley 2 ̆ 7 s Boalt Coalition for a Diversified Faculty to make the important point that LatCrit praxis must go beyond theory and progressive lawyering to include a third dimension, political organizing. They argue that if we pay sufficient attention to this third dimension and its submerged histories it will reveal that student movements were central to the development of CRT and will expose the limitations of anti-essentialist theorizing. Together, these four articles present a vibrant picture of LatCrit praxis, a project that, as Francisco Valdes notes, is by its very nature 2 ̆ 2 perpetually under construction. 2 ̆ 2 They also present important questions about narrative responsibility that can help guide future work that employs narrative methodology...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of mentally ill individuals are non-violent, some evidence has suggested that mental illness or mental health symptoms are nearly universal among school shooters. For example, on April 16, 2007, a Virginia Tech (VT) <b>student</b> named Seung-Hui <b>Cho</b> shot and killed thirty-two faculty members and students on the campus and injured twenty-five more before taking his own life. For another instance, a 2002 report by the US Secret Service and US Department of Education found evidence that a majority of school shooters displayed evidence of mental health symptoms, often undiagnosed or untreated [...] Criminologists Fox and DeLateur note that mental illness {{is only part of the}} issue, however, and mass shooters tend to externalize their problems, blaming others and are unlikely to seek psychiatric help, even if available. [...] Other scholars have concluded that mass murderers display a common constellation of chronic mental health symptoms, chronic anger or antisocial traits, and a tendency to blame others for problems. [...] However, they note that attempting to [...] "profile" [...] school shooters with such a constellation of traits will likely result in many false positives as many individuals with such a profile do not engage in violent behaviors.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to several}} students, before the {{shooting}} began Cho looked into several classrooms. Erin Sheehan, an eyewitness and survivor {{who had been in}} room 207, told reporters that the shooter [...] "peeked in twice" [...] earlier in the lesson and that [...] "it was strange that someone {{at this point in the}} semester would be lost, looking for a class". At about 9:40 a.m., Cho began shooting. Cho's first attack after entering Norris occurred in an advanced hydrology engineering class taught by Professor G. V. Loganathan in room 206. Cho first shot and killed the professor, then continued firing, killing nine of the thirteen students in the room and injuring two others. Next, Cho went across the hall and into room 207, where instructor Jamie Bishop was teaching German. Cho shot at a student, then at Bishop, then at the rest of the students, killing Bishop and four students; six <b>students</b> were wounded. <b>Cho</b> then moved on to Norris 211 and 204. In both of these classrooms, Cho was initially prevented from entering due to barricades erected by instructors and students. In room 204, Professor Liviu Librescu, an Israeli Holocaust survivor, forcibly prevented Cho from entering the room. Librescu was able to hold the door closed until most of his students escaped through the windows, but he died after being shot multiple times through the door. One student in his classroom was killed. Instructor Jocelyne Couture-Nowak and student Henry Lee were killed in room 211 as they attempted to barricade the door. When Cho broke through the barricade and entered the room, Air Force ROTC Cadet Matthew La Porte charged the gunman and died after taking heavy fire in an attempt to save lives (he was later posthumously awarded the Airman's Medal for his actions). [...] According to the Virginia Tech Review Panel's report, eleven students died in room 211 and the six students who survived all suffered gunshot wounds. However, one of the survivors, Clay Violand, has stated that he played dead and escaped without injury.|$|R
