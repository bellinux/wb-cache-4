It represents a considerable improvement in terms of speed, accuracy, and simplicity with respect to classical gas stripping methods known as dilutor techniques. Furthermore, range of conditions of its use is larger in terms of: temperatures (from 90 to 600 K), corrosive power, and toxicity of handled compounds. Solutes that could adsorb inside <b>sampling</b> <b>valves</b> or {{on the walls of}} transfer lines between <b>sampling</b> <b>valve</b> and GC detector are now studied easily; thanks to new design and procedure. Activity coefficients of one solute into one solvent at five temperatures, several repeatability tests included, are obtained in worst cases in less than 3 h. One accurate activity coefficient measurement (toluene in water) at one temperature can be realized in less than 2 min, after loading of the dilutor cell, instead of more than half an hour for unreliable results with previous equipment. It must be pointed out that the slope determination (slope of the logarithm of the exponential decay of solute composition in vapor phase which is in equilibrium with liquid phase) is the highest source of errors (flow rate, temperature, number of moles of solute are known with high accuracy with respect to slopes); they are now determined within few % instead of up to tens of % in the most difficult cases leading to higher accuracies of measured activity coefficients, Henrys constants at infinite dilutions or solubility data.

40|$|Background and Aims: Risk Stratification has an {{important}} place in cardiac surgery to identify high-risk cases and optimally allocate resources. Hence various risk scoring systems have been tried to predict mortality. The aim {{of the present study}} was to validate the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II) in Indian cardiac surgical patients. Methods: After obtaining ethics committee clearance, data on EuroSCORE II variables were collected for all patients > 18 years undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve surgery and mixed (CABG + valve) procedures between January 2011 and December 2012. Mortality prediction was done using the online calculator from the site www. euroscore. org. The calibration of the EuroSCORE II model was analysed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow test and discrimination was analysed by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and calculating area under the curve (AUC). The analysis was done in the total <b>sample,</b> CABG, <b>valve</b> surgery and in mixed procedures. Results: The overall observed mortality was 5. 7 % in the total sample, 6. 6 % in CABG, 4. 2 % in valve surgeries and 10. 2 % in mixed procedures whereas the predicted mortality was 2. 9 %, 3. 1 %, 2. 4 %, 5. 1 % in total <b>sample,</b> CABG, <b>valve</b> surgery and mixed procedure, respectively. The significance (P value) of Hosmer–Lemeshow test was 0. 292, 0. 45, 0. 56 and 1 for the total <b>sample,</b> CABG, <b>valve</b> surgery and mixed procedure, respectively, indicating good calibration.

The single capillary column, temperature programmed method was designed for complete analysis of reactants and products (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, C 1 -C- 10 hydrocarbons, and C 1 -C 6 alcohols) : a <b>sample</b> selection <b>valve</b> is used to switch between either the heated line used for input of the synthesis gases or the heated line used to transport reaction products from the reactor.

Peak identification is performed by mass spectrometry and by comparison of component retention times.
