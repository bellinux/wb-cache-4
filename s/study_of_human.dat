He {{is known for his}} work on animal rights from the perspective of political theory, which is the subject of his two books: An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory (2010, Palgrave Macmillan) and Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012, Columbia University Press). He {{is currently working on a}} third book. He is a founding member of the Centre for Animals and Social Justice, a UK-based think tank focussed on furthering the social and political status of nonhuman animals. He joined the Department at Sheffield in 2012, having previously been a faculty member at the Centre for the <b>Study</b> <b>of</b> <b>Human</b> Rights, London School of Economics.|$|E
5|$|Arrington's father {{offered to}} pay for Arrington {{to serve as an}} LDS missionary, but not for a {{university}} education. Arrington did not serve an LDS mission, but considered his educational endeavors a form of church service. Under a scholarship to the University of Idaho, Arrington studied agricultural science in 1935, later changing to agricultural economics. George S. Tanner, the director of the LDS Institute at the University of Idaho, was a progressive intellectual Mormon who taught Arrington that Christianity and science could be compatible and that other translations of the Bible could assist in its interpretation. One of the university's newest economics professors, Erwin Graue, taught the ideas of Alfred Marshall and influenced Arrington to see economics as a <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> relationships and not just mathematical economic forces. Marshall wrote that religious fervor could influence people to act altruistically.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> {{interactions with}} the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most basic}} {{definition}} of anthropology is the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>humans.</b> However, cyborgs, by definition, describe {{something that is}} not entirely an organic human. Moreover, limiting a discipline to the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>humans</b> may be difficult the more that technology allows humans to transcend the normal conditions of organic life. The prospect of a posthuman condition calls into question the nature and necessity of a field focused on studying humans.|$|R

Nonetheless, inhibition of CYP2D6 by doxepin could be of clinical importance.|$|E
