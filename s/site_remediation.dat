25|$|Marlboro Middle School {{contamination}} {{issue was}} an issue which was handled {{by the state and}} local level. It was not a Superfund site. This field was an Angus bull farm prior to being donated to the town for school construction. During the soccer fields improvement program, tests were conducted at the soccer complex which showed elevated levels of unspecified contaminants. The Mayor closed the fields as soon as the test results came in. The township then applied for and received a grant to help with the remediation work. Marlboro received money from the Hazardous Discharge <b>Site</b> <b>Remediation</b> Fund to conduct soil remediation at the soccer fields.|$|E
2500|$|Until the mid-1990s, most of {{the funding}} came from a tax on the {{petroleum}} and chemical industries, reflecting the polluter pays principle. In 1994, [...] President William J. Clinton proposed a new Superfund reform bill, Executive Order (E.O) 12898, which some environmentalists and industry lobbyists saw as an improvement, but the bill did not get bipartisan support. The Clinton administration’s environmental justice policy called for the regional office of the Environmental Protection Agency to apply required guidelines for its managers {{to take into consideration}} data analysis, managed public participation, and economic opportunity when considering the geography of toxic waste <b>site</b> <b>remediation.</b> [...] The newly elected Republican Congress made numerous unsuccessful efforts to significantly weaken the law. The Clinton Administration then adopted some industry favored reforms as policy and blocked most major changes.

2500|$|In the 38th Parliament of British Columbia the BC NDP, with Trevena, {{formed the}} Official Opposition. She was {{selected}} for the bi-partisan Special Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture to deliver recommendations {{on the development of}} fish farms in BC. NDP leader Carole James assigned Trevena to be the official critic to the Employment and Income Assistance ministry, headed by BC Liberal Claude Richmond. She supported the 2005 review of welfare rates in which she advocated for earning exemptions and opposed the ministry providing welfare recipients with [...] "free socks, T-shirts and travel mugs" [...] in exchange for authorizing direct deposits of welfare cheques into a bank account. She chastised Richmond after an internal survey of ministry employees reported very morale and revealed he was ignoring staff recommendations. On local issues, Trevena lobbied the government to intervene in the bankruptcy of a Port Alice pulp mill. While the mill was 87 {{years old at the time}} and required equipment upgrades and environmental remediation, it also comprised 80% of Port Alice's tax base and was one of only a few mills in the world that produced specialty products using dissolving sulphite pulp; the province eventually directed $800,000 to Port Alice to cover the loss of the 2005 property taxes, facilitated the sale of the mill to a Swiss investment company for $1, and provided $7.5 million for <b>site</b> <b>remediation.</b> When another mill was facing closure (Elk Falls sawmill in February 2008), Minister of Forests Rich Coleman declined to offer provincial assistance but recognized Trevena for her efforts helping keep the Port Alice mill open. Trevena backed the creation of the North Coast Trail through Cape Scott Provincial Park, but opposed efforts at developing private accommodations in the park. During the debate over whether the Vancouver Island Health Authority should build a new hospital or renovate existing facilities in Campbell River and Comox, Trevena campaigned in support of renovating the existing hospitals. When the Health Authority chose to build a new $306-million, 230-bed facility near Courtenay instead, Trevena lobbied Minister of Health George Abbott not to approve the decision, and continued to publicly campaign in support of the renovations. She delivered an 18,775 signature petition to the Legislative Assembly requesting Abbott to not approve the Health Authority's plan; the Health Authority eventually relented and upgraded the two smaller hospitals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Contaminated <b>sites</b> <b>remediation</b> {{is one of}} the hot {{points in}} {{environmental}} protection fields. Therefore, an important research project is how to expediently determine the bound and level of pollution of contaminated sites. This may help to decide on a timely and accurate rescue plan so as to minimize the costs and to improve the effect of restoration. This is also the basis of contaminated <b>sites</b> <b>remediation</b> acceptance. There are many influencing factors to confirm the remediation areas on contaminated sites. Studies show that three-dimensional interpolation method is effective tool to delimit the pollution scope. Different three-dimensional interpolation methods have different results in contaminate distribution prediction and directly affect the boundary of contamination. This paper selects one specific case with heavy metal lead contamination to study three-dimensional interpolation methods. The three-dimensional stratigraphic model is established for uncertainty analysis and error analysis in the grid through Kriging, IDW（Shepard）and nearest neighbor interpolation method. Results show that 40 m* 40 m grids have the highest accuracy of stratigraphic simulation. Nearest neighbor interpolation method is most suitable for stratigraphic model building. Kriging interpolation method is more suitable for constructing three-dimensional pollutant prediction model. On the basis of above, this text established one distribution prediction model of soil lea...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Ozone {{sparging}} and recirculation is a {{new technology}} being applied to remediate organic constituents in groundwater. The process, developed by KV Associates, Inc. (KVA), combines in-situ oxidation with in-well recirculation of groundwater. The KVA C-Sparger ™ system sparges ozone at two separate depth intervals, and the in-well groundwater pump distributes the oxidant and creates mixing zones within the aquifer (Figure 1). The design approaches for two <b>site</b> <b>remediations</b> using KVA’s C-Sparge ™ process are presented for comparison. Initial field performance results are also presented, as available. The two sites vary in both their constituent distribution and performance goals, resulting in different design approaches. The design flexibility afforded by the KVA process allows designers to match the in-situ processes to site-specific conditions...|$|R

30|$|Regardless {{of which}} {{government}} entity has {{jurisdiction over the}} MEC-contaminated land, the remediation guidelines are the same. In 1989, the National Contaminated <b>Sites</b> <b>Remediation</b> Program was launched to address human health and environmental quality concerns regarding contaminated sites in Canada [34]. This regulation was followed in 2005 by {{the creation of the}} Department of National Defense (DND) Unexploded Explosive Ordinance and UXO Legacy Sites Program to address the challenge of MEC management [35]. This program states that sites can never be cleared 100 %, and that there is no criterion that allows a site to be ruled 'safe.' The program has similarly asserted that based upon Canadian experiences, MEC have produced limited environmental impacts, resulting in the characterization of MEC as a public safety issue rather than a contamination issue [35]. Also within the DND, the Defense Construction Canada (DCC) is responsible for contracting and overseeing MEC removal. The DCC provides additional environmental guidelines.|$|R
