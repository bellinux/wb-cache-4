40|$|The {{influence}} of heat treatment and <b>spraying</b> <b>angle</b> on the cohesion strength of plasma sprayed deposits has been studied. Three coatings were selected: NiCr + Cr 2 O 3, ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3 (8 wt-%), and Mo. The substrate used was aferritic Cr steel. Heat treatments of 4 h were conducted after spraying in the temperature range 600 - 900 ° C and the <b>spraying</b> <b>angle</b> varied from 45 to 90 ° {{to the surface}} of the sample. The cohesion strength of the deposit was measured using tensile tests. For the Cr 2 O 3 deposit, the cohesion tensile strength was found to increase strongly with the temperature of the heat treatment but was not influenced by <b>spraying</b> <b>angle.</b> For the ZrO 2 - 81 Y 2 O 3 coating neither the heat treatment nor the <b>spraying</b> <b>angle</b> affected the cohesion strength, whereas for the Mo coating, the cohesion strength increased with decreasing <b>spraying</b> <b>angle</b> and heat treatment had no effect. © 1995 The Institute of Materials.

40|$|Purpose: In this study, a {{numerical}} simulation {{model of the}} oil spraying system is established. Design/methodology/approach: Spraying lubrication is a common form of the rolling bearing lubrication. Butwith the increase of the bearing speed, the roller cage is frequently shattered, which may lead to failure of thebearing. The shatter of roller cage {{may be related to}} the spraying mode of oil. For high-speed rolling bearing,the roller cage shatter can be cracked due to the shortage of oil, caused by lubricating oil not sprayed into theroller cage shatter. This condition can be ameliorated by changing the spraying mode of oil supply system. Themodel considered the spraying speed, <b>spraying</b> <b>angle,</b> oil pressure, oil viscosity, structure of roller cage shatter,rotating speed as the main parameters. By optimization, the best way of oil spraying was obtained which canmeet lubrication requirement of high-speed rolling bearing. At the same time, the numerical simulation resultsalso revealed that the optimal spraying mode is different for different rolling bearings. Findings: The simulating results indicate that due to the effect of the air pressure and airflow thickness, theoptimal spraying position is at a region closer to the inner ring of the bearings. Practical implications: This paper will provide useful information to applying numerical simulation of the oilspraying system. Originality/value: The computer simulation allows to better understand the interdependence betweenparameters of process and choosing optimal solution...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of the {{modelling}} of the spraying of liquid metal which solidifies on an arbitrary surface and of the subsequent growth of the deposit. The new, two-dimensional continuous model consists of a definition of the source involved in the spraying process, the kinetics of points on an arbitrary substrate, including their visibility and the spray's sticking efficiency, and the redefinition of a new surface on the completion of every iteration step. A simple merging procedure is developed to reconnect pans of a curve which become too close during spraying. This procedure produces closed voids, called macro pores, in the deposited material. The model can also predict porosity distribution in the deposited material, defined here as a continuous function of the spray's parameters. The model has been applied in several cases when a spray's parameters were varied, the most important parameter being the <b>spraying</b> <b>angle.</b> The influence of this parameter on shape evolution was determined. The porosity distribution function was calculated for every set of input parameters, and its relationship to the shape evolution was established.

Ensaio realizado com bicos de cone vazio tipo disco mostrou, em certos casos, aumentos superiores a 100 % sobre a vazão inicial, já nas primeiras 50 horas de operação. Evidentemente, isto também conduz a um aumento de mais de 100 % na quantidade de defensivos aplicados, caso o usuário não se aperceba do problema.

Significance The product surface coating is a very essential working procedure, especially the surface coating thickness even directly influences the outward appearance and the quality of products. Some factory operators grasp the spray gun to carry on the spraying to the hemisphere surface object,this operation causes the surface distance of spray gunis large to the hemisphere surface object. The rotation of the spray gun makes surfacecoating non-uniform. It is easy to cause the phenomenon of missing spraying,this causes the defective rate to stay at a high level, spray coating efficiency is low, it influences productivity seriously. In this design,we use the chain drive to lead the rising and rotaing mechanism that makes the waiting spraying hemispheresurface objects pass the spray gun work area, in two rows along the straight line, at the uniform speed. By the rotation of spherical surface object, the spraying is made uniform. The spray gun is controlled by PLC intelligence modular control and may adjust the open and close frequency, spraying density and scope and the straight distance of the spray gun to work piece surface, this makes the product superface coating uniform...|$|E

The formation and wideness of the <b>spray</b> <b>angle</b> were reported {{to be affected by}} the changes in geometrical parameters. In the present study, the effect of the interaction between two geometrical parameters (swirl-generating vane angle and discharge orifice diameter) on the swirl effervescent atomizer <b>spray</b> <b>angle</b> was studied. A newly-designed swirl effervescent atomizer was developed with 30 °, 45 ° and 60 ° swirl-generating vane angle and 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 mm discharge orifice diameter.

The fuel injection quantity and spray {{characteristics were}} measured. The spray analysis parameters were spray shape, penetration length, and <b>spray</b> <b>angle</b> at six nozzle holes. Three types of injector were used, the nozzle holes diameter were 0. 166 mm (Injector 1), 0. 250 mm (Injector 2), and 0. 250 mm with enlargement of orifice hole from 0. 6 mm to 1. 0 mm (Injector 3). The fuel injection pressure was varied by 5 MPa from 35 to 70 MPa when the ambient pressure was varied 0, 2. 5, and 5 MPa. When using Injector 3 {{in comparison to the}} others, the DME injection quantity was increased 1. 69 ~ 2. 02 times. Through this, it had the similar low heat value with diesel which was injected Injector 1. Among three types of injector, Injector 3 had the fastest development velocity of penetration length. In case of <b>spray</b> <b>angle,</b> Injector 2 had the largest <b>spray</b> <b>angle.</b> Through these results, only the way enlargement th...|$|R
40|$|The {{match of}} an {{injector}} with the combustion chamber was studied through {{computational fluid dynamics}} simulation under four different engine loads. Four design parameters including the start of injection, <b>spray</b> <b>angle,</b> injector protrusion length and swirl ratio were examined. The Latin hypercube together with a non-linear programming by quadratic Lagrangian algorithm {{were used in the}} optimisation. Comparisons were made in the engine loads in terms of the optimisation history, objectives, sub-objectives and design parameters. The commonalities of the design parameters of the optimums were summarised. Additionally, a detailed combustion process comparison was conducted on the same engine loads (100 % and 25 % engine loads) between the optimum and baseline designs, respectively. Finally, the effects of the design parameters on the objective were investigated by the response surface methodology. The results indicate that the non-linear programming by quadratic Lagrangian method is an effective algorithm to spot the optimums with the best trade-off between nitrogen oxides and soot emissions. The optimisation process presents better qualities at 100 % and 75 % engine loads than in the case of 50 % and 25 % engine loads. The design parameters of the optimum under each engine load have something in common, namely, that they all prefer late injection, low swirl, large injection angle and slightly smaller nozzle protrusion length. Besides, start of injection and swirl ratio have larger influence on the objective as opposed to the nozzle protrusion length and <b>spray</b> <b>angle.</b> The large start of injection together with the small swirl ratio can reduce the objective significantly and vice versa. A large nozzle protrusion length with a small <b>spray</b> <b>angle</b> contributes to the reduction of the objective and so does the combination of a small nozzle protrusion length with a large <b>spray</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} work {{to investigate the}} swirl spray characteristics that emanates from hollow-cone and solid-cone spray simplex atomizers is presented. Main objective of the research is to investigate the spray characteristics, i. e. spray breakup length, discharge coefficient and <b>spray</b> cone <b>angle</b> at different nozzle orifice diameter and injection pressure. Discharge coefficient is almost uninfluenced by the operating Reynolds number. This test also reveals that both breakup length and <b>spray</b> cone <b>angle</b> increases as orifice diameter is increased. Higher injection pressure leads to shorter breakup length and wider <b>spray</b> cone <b>angle...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the influence of}} processing parameters on the microstructure of plasma-sprayed deposits, small-angle neutron scattering measurements were made of the processing-parameter-dependent specific surface area of the voids in gray alumina deposits. These studies indicate that the voids are {{in the form of}} pores between the splats and around inclusions or unmelted particles, and are also in the form of cracks within the splats which may develop during cooling. The porous volume increases as the <b>angle</b> between the <b>spray</b> gun and the substrate (the "spray angle") decreases. This study also indicates that the cracks are preferentially oriented, and that the crack orientation also depends on the <b>spray</b> <b>angle.</b> The interlamellar pores, however, are preferentially oriented parallel to the substrate surface, and the orientation of the pore is independent of the <b>spray</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R
