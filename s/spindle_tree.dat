40|$|A Y-tube {{olfactometer}} and a still-air olfactometer {{were developed}} to determine the attractiveness of several host plants for the vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus (F.); Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Odours of weevil-damaged yew (Taxus baccata) and <b>spindle</b> <b>trees</b> (Euonymus fortunei) are attractive to the vine weevil, but Rhododendron and strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) are not. Undamaged Euonymus is attractive to the weevils in springtime but not in late summer. When clean air or undamaged Euonymus is the alternative, weevils strongly prefer weevil-damaged Euonymus foliage, and this preference is retained throughout the year. Hence, plant damage {{plays a role in}} attraction of the vine weevil. In contrast to the permanent attractiveness of weevil-damaged Euonymus, mechanically damaged plants gradually lose the attractiveness that they have early in the growing season. This suggests that emission of volatiles, produced by the plants in response to weevil damage, is important for attraction of the weevils because the weevils may use these plant odours to find suitable food plants throughout the season. Apart from weevil-damage-related plant volatiles, green leaf volatiles must also play a significant role, as indicated by the fact that weevils prefer: early season, undamaged Euonymus over clean air; early season, mechanically damaged Euonymus over undamaged Euonymus; and, throughout the season, had no preference when mechanically damaged Euonymus is tested against weevil-damaged Euonymus. Thus, monitoring traps may be developed by the use of green leaf volatiles and/or herbivore-induced volatiles, as attractant...|$|R

We have shown through a large field study that increasing tree density significantly limits trees size, which allows {{a broad range of}} manageable densities for trees on M. 9. After seven years. The cumulative yield of the highest tree density in this study (2 X 10 ft) was three times greater than the lowest density (10 X 18 ft). This could result in substantially greater profitability for the high-density systems with good fruit prices. Apple growers around the worldcontinue to plant high-tree-densityorchards. However, there is great disparity of opinion on what is the optimum density or optimum tree shape. Some growers are using densities above 2, 000 trees/acre and some growers at the other extreme, plant densities of 200 trees/acre. There is also considerable debate about which training system is best with some favoring the Slender Spindle system, while others like the Vertical Axis system and others some version of V system.

To achieve the primary exploration on the material basis for Qijian Heji to improve the blood glucose levels of type 2 diabetic kk mice. Methods: We applied RT-PCR to detecting the expression of gene targets in kidney tissues of type 2 diabetes model kk mice. The detected gene targets were predicted by the network pharmacology method in the early stage of the project. Through the observation of the hypoglycemic effect of different ratios of Qijian Heji, the optimal proportion was determined and then used to conduct research of material basis. Results: Continuous administration of Qijian Heji (astragalus root: <b>spindle</b> <b>tree</b> wings =  3 : 1) for six weeks resulted in significantly lowering blood glucose levels in mice in the fourth week, dropping from 33. 3 to 21. 9  mmol/L; this lower level was maintained in the fifth to sixth weeks.

40|$|Two {{structurally}} different chitin-binding proteins {{were isolated}} from bark and {{leaves of the}} <b>spindle</b> <b>tree</b> (Euonymus europaeus L.). Both the small hevein-like chitin-binding protein (Ee-CBP) and the classical class-I chitinase (Ee-chitinase) possess antifungal properties, Ee-CBP being far more potent than Ee-chitinase. In addition, Ee-CBP and Ee-chitinase display a pronounced synergistic effect when added together in the test medium. Determination of the biological activities indicates that the synergism between Ee-CBP and Ee-chitinase relies on a different mode of action. Cloning and sequencing of the corresponding genes further revealed that Ee-CBP and Ee-chitinase are simultaneously expressed in bark and leaf tissues, and hence can act synergistically in planta. Moreover, analysis of the deduced sequences allowed the exact relationship between the structurally different Ee-CBP and Ee-chitinase to be corroborated. Both proteins are synthesized as similar chimeric precursors consisting of an N-terminal hevein domain linked to a C-terminal chitinase-like domain by a hinge region. However, whereas {{in the case of}} Ee-chitinase the C-terminal chitinase domain remains linked to the N-terminal hevein domain, the corresponding domain is cleaved from the Ee-CBP-precursor resulting {{in the formation of the}} hevein-type Ee-CBP. Since both precursors are-apart from the hinge region between the hevein and chitinase domains-very similar, the Ee-CBP/Ee-chitinase system offers a unique opportunity to study the importance of sequence and/or structural information comprised in the hinge region for the posttranslational processing of the respective precursor proteins. status: publishe...|$|E

Research was {{conducted}} in the experiment plot of euramerican poplar, clone I- 214, which was founded with one year seedling type 1 / 1 with spacing 6 × 6 m in the square system on the alluvial soils of river Sava basin in which browning processes is expressed. Eleven years after the plantation establishment 3 blocks with two experimental plot of 0. 2016 ha, which are separated by a so-called. protective order, were singled out. In the experimental plot all the trees were numbered and measured by two cross-dbh, with an accuracy of 1 mm, and height, with an accuracy of 1 dm. The crown projection radius of 8 positions, each rotated to 45 o, were measured. On the three experimental plots (one in each block) selective thinning was carried out (PP-E), at which in each plots 50 % of trees were cut down, or {{the distance between the}} trees raised on average 8. 5 × 8. 5 m. Firstly, a collective called. promising trees set aside, in the number that corresponds to an average distance of 8. 5 × 8. 5 m, and their main competitors were removed. The trees behind in development, which is mainly due to additional filling in plantations two years after planting, are also removed because they were judged as silvicutural non-perspective. The remaining three experimental plots were control (PP-K). In each repetition trees for dendrometric analysis were sampled, the dominant one (dg 20 %) and a mean tree which has mean quadratic diameter (dg). In the 16 thyears of plantation development diameters at breast height (dbh) and height of each tree were re-measured, sa well as crown projection radius. The development of mean and dominant trees showed that the investigated habitat is the medium favorable for the cultivation of the poplar clone I- 214. Current increment of diameter, height and volume in the 11 thyear was in the intensive phase, where volume increment has not yet culminated (Figure 1 – 3). As a suitable element of growth to determine the start of thinning operation on a biological point of view, can be ring width along the <b>spindle</b> <b>tree.</b> In the first five years the tree has had a full solitary growth, and from the seventh year there is a competitive relationship between trees in plantation, which is manifested by changing the ring width along the <b>spindle</b> <b>tree</b> (Figure 4 and 5). This means that before the seventh year thinning does not have any biological justification. Models 1 and 2 of volume tables, constructed measuring felled trees from thinning (Table 2), and which are the dependence of the volume of tree from diameter at breast height (model 1) and from the diameter at breast and height (model 2), proved to be equally good at calculating the volume per hectare in the 11 thyear and more convenient compared to other tables and models (Table 3). To calculate the volume in the 16 thyear two input volume tables can be successfully used (model 2), while the application of model 1 is limited at the 11 thyear. In the 11 th year at the experimental plot an average of 263 – 266 trees per hectare are found, which represents a survival rate of about 95 %. Total basal area averaged from 14. 70 to 14. 97 m 2 /ha, while volume was an average from 156. 67 to 157. 62 m 3 ·ha- 1. By applying the statistical t-test significant difference in the number of trees, basal area and volume per hectare was not determined within the experimental plots before applying the silvicultural treatments (Table 4). By applying thinning operation, 122 trees per hectare (46 %), 6. 45 m 2 /ha (43 %) of the total basal area, 66. 08 m 3 /ha (42 %) of the total volume and 2645 m 2 /ha (40 %) of the the crown projection area were removed, which represent a strong procedure and is located above the so-called. critical basal area (Table 4, 13). Size of allowable cut in the thinning of 66. 08 m 3 /ha was in the limits expected on the basis of previous research for the density of 278 trees per hectare and the habitat medium favorable for the development of poplar clone I- 214. However, the assortment structureof allowable cut is more favorable compared to thinning in younger plantations in the more favorable habitats and produces 50 % of technical wood, 30 % of pulpwood and 20 % of wastewood (Table 4, 9, 15). Between 11 and 16 years on both series of experimental plot the mortality of trees was not determined. Five years after application of thinning treatment {{a significant difference in the}} number of trees, basal area, volume and crown projection areas of trees per hectarewere determined between the experimental and control plots (Table 4). The significant difference in the mean diameters, heights and crown projection areas of the mean and the dominant trees (Table 5, 6), as well as between the diameter strucures (Figure 7) were also determined between investigated plots. For a period of 5 years after application of thinning operation at the experimental field current basal area and volume increment per hectare accounted 85 % of basal area increment and 75 % of volume increment of the control plots wich had the number of trees twice higher than experimental plots (Table 14). For five years of positive reactions to increase growing space of remaining trees on the experimental plots the size of the total basal area and volume of trees removed by thinning operation is not compensated: the total basal area and the volume per hectare amounted to 2 / 3, and the crown projection area amounted 87 % of the size of the control plot. The reaction of trees on experimental plot with thinning treatment for 5 years is great and is reflected in greater mean diameter by 10. 6 %, greater mean tree volume by 21. 9 % and increased the crown projection area by 59. 0 % compared to control plot. In contrast, the mean Lorey’s height at the experimental plot with thinning treatment decreased by 4. 2 % compared to control plot. This has contributed to the intensification of the current (average periodic) volume increment compared to the period before applying thinning operation. Greater assimilation apparatus of trees in the experimental plots with thinning tretament and higher current diameter and volume increment indicate the need to extend the production cycle at the best assortment structure compared to the control plot. The research results indicate the validity of efforts that the thinning operation in poplar plantations should be treated as a biological and an economic category. As a biological category the thinning operation contributes to accelerating the growth of the remaining phenotypically better established trees and achieve optimum production. As economic categories with thinning operation realized the previous crop, and it being understood that the assortment of allowable cut in the thinning cover cost cutting and the establishment of plantations with more trees. In this framework it is necessary to direct further research, because the poplar plantations,which are aimed to applying thinning operation, are flexible enough to allow adaptation to changing market conditions...|$|E
