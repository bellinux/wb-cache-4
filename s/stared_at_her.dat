500|$|Two of Bosse's older sisters, Alma (1863–1947) and Dagmar (1866–1954), {{were already}} {{successful}} performers when Harriet {{was a small}} child. [...] Inspired by these role models, Harriet began her acting career in a Norwegian touring company run by her sister Alma and Alma's husband Johan Fahlstrøm (1867–1938). [...] Invited to play Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, the eighteen-year-old Harriet reported {{in a letter to}} her sister Inez that she had been paralysed by stage-fright before the premiere, but had then taken delight in the performance, the curtain-calls, and the way people <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in the street the next day. [...] Alma was Harriet's first and only—rather authoritarian—acting teacher. Their harmonious and sisterly teacher–pupil relationship became strained when Alma discovered that her husband Johan and Harriet were having an affair. [...] Both Bosse parents were now dead, and Harriet, ordered by Alma to leave, used a modest legacy from her father to finance studies in Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Paris.|$|E

[...] Rita Matthews, who went to Antarctica {{during the same period}} as Uberuaga said that the [...] "men were all over the place. There were some that would never stop going after you." [...] In 1983, Marilyn Woody described living at McMurdo station and said, [...] "It makes your head spin, all this attention from all these men."

2500|$|In Ophelia's next appearance, {{she tells}} Polonius that Hamlet rushed {{into her room}} with his {{clothing}} askew and a [...] "hellish" [...] expression on his face; he only <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> nodding three times without speaking to her. Based on what Ophelia told him, Polonius concludes that he was wrong to forbid Ophelia from seeing Hamlet, and that Hamlet must be mad with love for her. Polonius immediately decides to go to Claudius, the new King of Denmark and also Hamlet's uncle and stepfather, about the situation. Polonius later suggests to Claudius that they hide behind an [...] to overhear Hamlet speaking to Ophelia, when Hamlet thinks the conversation is private. Since Polonius is now sure that Hamlet is lovesick for Ophelia, he thinks Hamlet will express his love for her. Claudius agrees to try the eavesdropping plan later.|$|E
