Includes bibliographical refences. The {{issues of}} a {{suitable}} transmission image size, general behaviour, and buffer {{control of a}} very low bitrate videophone video <b>signal</b> <b>coder</b> {{to be used in}} future mobile and public switched telephone networks are addressed. A software simulator of the coder was built so that the performance of the coder and the various alternative methods under consideration could be tested by subjective evaluation. In the case of transmission image size a clear choice between the two alternatives, QCIF and NCIF. is achieved: QCIF. The behaviour of the coder is explained on the basis of some statistical parameters extracted from it. With head-and-shoulders sequences without buffer regulation the coder is succesfiil in allocating bits to those regions in the image containing the most important information. Finally, the buffer control scheme of the coder is analyzed and an alternative method, based on framewise analysis of the bits created for that frame, is developed which is shown to be better than the original.

However, to date we haven’t depicted which communication aspects have affected aviation safety most frequently. Based on literature, {{we developed a}} tool which includes communication characteristics related to actors, <b>signal,</b> <b>coder,</b> channel, decoder, direction, timing, distance, predictability and interference.

40|$|JPEG 2000 is {{the latest}} {{international}} standard for compression of still images. Although the JPEG 2000 codec is designed to compress images, we illustrate that {{it can also be}} used to compress other signals. As an example, we illustrate how the JPEG 2000 codec can be used to compress electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Experiments using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database illustrate that the proposed approach outperforms many existing ECG compression schemes. The desirable characteristics of the JPEG 2000 codec, such as precise rate control and progressive quality, are retained in the presented scheme. To compress the ECG data using a JPEG 2000 codec, the one-dimensional ECG sequence is processed to produce a two-dimensional matrix. Since it is desirable to exploit both the intrabeat and interbeat dependencies, we first separate each “period ” of the ECG. Each period is normalized to account for their differences in length and stored as one row of a matrix. This matrix is then encoded using JPEG 2000.

40|$|The {{challenge}} {{in the field of}} multimedia telecommunications is an attempt to integrate texts, sound, images and videos coherently and consistently and to ensure simplicity and interactivity of operation. In order to make the proposed multimedia applications acceptable to end-users, the quality of transmission through the network and message presentation should have special attention. The main aims of this paper are the introduction to the communication channel with its basic elements, {{a detailed description of the}} information source and the presentation of possible approaches to the analysis of the telecommunication channel. Introduction In the age of mass application of various communication means, end-users of telecommunication channel elements rarely pay attention to the processes taking place in everyday communication and the elements presented in the channel. In order to discuss all the factors that influence the establishment and maintenance of the links, this paper will explain the basic elements of telecommunication channels. Source Every object that generates messages to be transferred to a recipient is called the source of the message. Directors, writers, speakers, books, newspapers, various instruments (thermometer, barometer, ammeter, etc.), computers, a man himself - these are all sources of various messages. In relation to facilities that generate messages, there are different sources of messages. All the messages that they generate belong to discrete or continuous modes of messages. Discrete messages can be presented with element sets, where elements can be considered through different values of observed messages. Each text message of arbitrary length, for example, is made of a finite number of elements - symbols (letters, numbers, punctuation marks), from the set of symbols called the alphabet message source. Continuous messages can be presented with an infinite number of sets of elements where elements can have different values of the observed messages. Coder of messages generated by a message source should be transmitted to the recipient. For that purpose, an appropriate communication channel is used, with appropriate electrical signals as material bearers of the message. Definition of the code and the code system The set of combinations of digits that mirrors the elements of the set A is called a code. The established rule considers situations when each symbol from the set A is associated with the combination of elements of the set B. The function f defining this translation must be defined. This replacement is called a code replacement. <b>Signal</b> <b>coder</b> A coder performs signal transformation of coded messages to an electrical signal adapted for transmission via the transmission system. The most common signals are voltage transmission via cable connection or an electromagnetic field in the radio transmission. Modern systems for transferring discrete messages contain codecs and modems. Portable system A portable system is the medium for signal transmission from the source to the point of receipt. It can be wired and wireless. A wired transmission system is used in the stationary elements of communication systems. Wireless signal transmission is used in all conditions and it is more rational, efficient and economical. On their way through the transmission system, signals are subject to a variety of interferences. For a better insight into the interference impact, the source of interference is added to the whole system. Conclusion The model of the telecommunication channel is a complex system of a series of mutually dependent elements. Effectiveness of these elements is evaluated by the performances of the probability that the transfer of information through the channel will be successful. In a thus modeled telecommunication channel, regardless of the technical means used which is either a system or a circuit, the place and role of each element can be considered, which is the basis for consideration of possible approaches to the protection of information in the telecommunication channel...|$|E

30|$|Parametric {{models are}} of great {{interest}} for representing and manipulating sounds. However, {{the quality of the}} resulting signals depends on the precision of the parameters. When the signals are available, these parameters can be estimated, but the presence of noise decreases the resulting precision of the estimation. Furthermore, the Cramér-Rao bound shows the minimal error reachable with the best estimator, which can be insufficient for demanding applications. These limitations can be overcome by using the coding approach which consists in directly transmitting the parameters with the best precision using the minimal bitrate. However, this approach does not take advantage of the information provided by the estimation from the signal and may require a larger bitrate and a loss of compatibility with existing file formats. The {{purpose of this article is}} to propose a compromised approach, called the 'informed approach,’ which combines analysis with (coded) side information in order to increase the precision of parameter estimation using a lower bitrate than pure coding approaches, the audio signal being known. Thus, the analysis problem is presented in a coder/decoder configuration where the side information is computed and inaudibly embedded into the mixture <b>signal</b> at the <b>coder.</b> At the decoder, the extra information is extracted and is used to assist the analysis process. This study proposes applying this approach to audio spectral analysis using sinusoidal modeling which is a well-known model with practical applications and where theoretical bounds have been calculated. This work aims at uncovering new approaches for audio quality-based applications. It provides a solution for challenging problems like active listening of music, source separation, and realistic sound transformations.|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{presents}} {{results on}} optimal coding and decoding of discrete-time stochastic signals, {{in the sense}} of minimizing a distortion metric subject to a constraint on the bit-rate and on the signal transfer function from source to reconstruction. The first (preliminary) contribution of this thesis is the introduction of new distortion metric that extends the mean squared error (MSE) criterion. We give this extension the name Weighted-Correlation MSE (WCMSE), and use it as the distortion metric throughout the thesis. The WCMSE is a weighted sum of two components of the MSE: the variance of the error component uncorrelated to the source, on the one hand, and the remainder of the MSE, on the other. The WCMSE can take account of signal transfer function constraints by assigning a larger weight to deviations from a target signal transfer function than to source-uncorrelated distortion. Within this framework, the second contribution is the solution of a family of feedback quantizer design problems for wide sense stationary sources using an additive noise model for quantization errors. These associated problems consist of finding the frequency response of the filters deployed around a scalar quantizer that minimize the WCMSE for a fixed quantizer signal-to-(granular) -noise ratio (SNR). This general structure, which incorporates pre-, post-, and feedback filters, includes as special cases well known source coding schemes such as pulse coded modulation (PCM), Differential Pulse-Coded Modulation (DPCM), Sigma Delta converters, and noise-shaping coders. The optimal frequency response of each of the filters in this architecture is found for each possible subset of the remaining filters being given and fixed. These results are then applied to oversampled feedback quantization. In particular, it is shown that, within the linear model used, and for a fixed quantizer SNR, the MSE decays exponentially with oversampling ratio, provided optimal filters are used at each oversampling ratio. If a subtractively dithered quantizer is utilized, then the noise model is exact, and the SNR constraint can be directly related to the bit-rate if entropy coding is used, regardless of the number of quantization levels. On the other hand, in the case of fixed-rate quantization, the SNR is related to the number of quantization levels, and hence to the bit-rate, when overload errors are negligible. It is shown that, for sources with unbounded support, the latter condition is violated for sufficiently large oversampling ratios. By deriving an upper bound on the contribution of overload errors to the total WCMSE, a lower bound for the decay rate of the WCMSE {{as a function of the}} oversampling ratio is found for fixed-rate quantization of sources with finite or infinite support. The third main contribution of the thesis is the introduction of the rate-distortion function (RDF) when WCMSE is the distortion metric, denoted by WCMSE-RDF. We provide a complete characterization for Gaussian sources. The resulting WCMSE-RDF yields, as special cases, Shannon's RDF, as well as the recently introduced RDF for source-uncorrelated distortions (RDF-SUD). For cases where only source-uncorrelated distortion is allowed, the RDF-SUD is extended to include the possibility of linear-time invariant feedback between reconstructed <b>signal</b> and <b>coder</b> input. It is also shown that feedback quantization schemes can achieve a bit-rate only 0. 254 bits/sample above this RDF by using the same filters that minimize the reconstruction MSE for a quantizer-SNR constraint. The fourth main contribution of this thesis is to provide a set of conditions under which knowledge of a realization of the RDF can be used directly to solve encoder-decoder design optimization problems. This result has direct implications in the design of subband coders with feedback, as well as in the design of encoder-decoder pairs for applications such as networked control. As the fifth main contribution of this thesis, the RDF-SUD is utilized to show that, for Gaussian sta-tionary sources with memory and MSE distortion criterion, an upper bound on the information-theoretic causal RDF can be obtained by means of an iterative numerical procedure, at all rates. This bound is tighter than 0 : 5 bits/sample. Moreover, if there exists a realization of the causal RDF in which the re-construction error is jointly stationary with the source, then the bound obtained coincides with the causal RDF. The iterative procedure proposed here to obtain Ritc(D) also yields a characterization of the filters in a scalar feedback quantizer having an operational rate that exceeds the bound by less than 0 : 254 bits/sample. This constitutes an upper bound on the optimal performance theoretically attainable by any causal source coder for stationary Gaussian sources under the MSE distortion criterion...|$|R
