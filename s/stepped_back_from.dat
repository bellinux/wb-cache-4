5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> {{his work}} at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E
5|$|Though the location, plan of attack, {{and timing}} were {{determined}} by Hitler, he blamed the defeat on his General Staff. Unlike Stalin, who gave his commanding generals the liberty to make important command decisions, Hitler's interference in German military matters progressively increased while {{his attention to the}} political aspects of the war decreased. The opposite was true for Stalin; throughout the Kursk campaign, he trusted the judgment of his commanders, and as their decisions led to battlefield success it increased his trust in their military judgment. Stalin <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> operational planning, only rarely overruling military decisions, resulting in the Red Army gaining more freedom of action {{during the course of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|For Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro, the {{opportunity}} to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro {{had been one of}} more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, Mamie Eisenhower, as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former First Lady was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971. Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the Washington quarter.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Morrissey {{auditioned for}} One Summer, a {{television}} series by Willy Russell for Yorkshire Television and Channel 4 about two Liverpool boys who run away to Wales one summer. Russell had been {{attached to the}} Everyman for many years, and Morrissey had seen {{him while he was}} working behind the bar downstairs from the theatre, though the two had never been introduced. Morrissey went to at least eight auditions, and in one read for the part of Icky opposite Paul McGann, who was reading for Billy. McGann, five years older than Morrissey, believed that he was too old to be playing the part of 16-year-old Billy, and <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the production, leaving the role to go to Morrissey. Spencer Leigh got the part of Icky and Ian Hart played the supporting role of Rabbit. Russell had a professional disagreement with the director Gordon Flemyng and producer Keith Richardson over the casting of 18-year-old Morrissey and Leigh; he believed that the sympathy of 16-year-olds running away was lost by casting older actors. Russell subsequently had his name removed from the credits of the original broadcast. After filming One Summer for five months, Morrissey went travelling in Kenya with his cousins. When he returned to Britain, One Summer was being broadcast, and he dealt with the new experience of being recognised in public.|$|E

25|$|The state {{retained}} {{both its}} powers {{and its role}} in the rural economy in the 1980s. Decollectivization, like the collectivization of the 1950s, was directed from the top down. Sometimes, apparently, it was imposed on communities that had been content with their collective methods. But in permitting households and communities greater leeway to decide what to produce and in allowing the growth of rural markets and small-scale industries, the state <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the close supervision and mandatory quotas of the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
25|$|After {{losing to}} Sweden {{in a battle}} for a bronze medal on 2014 IIHF World Championship in Minsk, Belarus, Jágr {{announced}} {{the end of his}} career in international play with the Czech national team, focusing his efforts on returning to the NHL post-season after New Jersey failed to qualify in 2014. Jágr, however, <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> his decision after being called up to the Czech team for the 2015 IIHF World Championship in Prague and Ostrava, making the team's roster. On 1 May, he scored a goal in the Czechs' 6–5 loss to Sweden, his 50th for the national team, to become the oldest player to score at the World Championship.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{reprocessing}} {{reduces the}} volume of high-level waste, but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not {{eliminate the need for}} a geological waste repository. Reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation, the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism, the political challenges of repository siting (a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel), and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle. In the United States, the Obama administration <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> President Bush's plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research.|$|E

25|$|The police {{violence}} {{sparked a}} show of support from other unions and a one-day strike of transport workers. Each side <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the confrontation: Chief Johannes and Mayor Bainbridge faced calls for their impeachment, while the union continued to urge its members not to give the police any justification for further attacks, disarming a number of picketers who wanted to return fire with fire. The union did not make any overt efforts to stop those few trucks accompanied by convoys of forty police cars apiece that tried to deliver goods, but sent so many cars with pickets to accompany those convoys {{that the police were}} never able to shepherd more than a few delivery trucks on any given day.|$|E
25|$|A {{week after}} the assassination, the Warren Commission was {{established}} by President Johnson to investigate the assassination, with Chief Justice Earl Warren leading the investigation. Ten months later, the Commission issued its report with the conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone when he killed Kennedy. Privately, his widow cared little about the investigation, stating {{that even if they}} had the right suspect, it would not bring her husband back. Nevertheless, she gave a deposition to the Warren Commission. Following the assassination and the media coverage that had focused intensely on her during and after the burial, Jacqueline <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> official public view, apart from a brief appearance in Washington to honor the Secret Service agent, Clint Hill, who had climbed aboard the limousine in Dallas to try to shield her and the President.|$|E
25|$|Flavio Briatore's {{future as}} QPR {{chairman}} came into question in September 2009 {{after he left}} the Renault F1 team in the midst of race fixing allegations. The Football League board discussed the matter on 8 October 2009 and declared that they would be awaiting a response from Briatore to various questions before commenting further. Meanwhile, the club continued to make losses (£18.8m in 2008–09 and £13.7m 2009–10). Briatore sold his 62% share to Ecclestone in December 2010, with the Italian possibly retaining a right of first refusal should Ecclestone sell, and initially <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the day-to-day running of the business in favour of Amit Bhatia and Ishan Saksena, the company chairman and managing director respectively. However, his involvement gradually returned, and conflicts between Briatore {{on the one hand and}} Bhatia and Saksena on the other resulted in both Bhatia and Saksena leaving QPR in May 2011.|$|E

25|$|Nuclear {{reprocessing}} {{does not}} reduce {{the volume of}} high-level waste, it separates out the useful isotopes leaving an increased volume of liquid high-level waste {{as a result of}} the solution-based chemical processes used to dissolve fuel rods and extract useful isotopes. It does reduce total radioactivity of the total waste, however the overall volume of the waste is higher and it does not eliminate waste nor heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository. Reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation, the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism, the political challenges of repository siting (a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel), the environmental risks of the aqueous and organic waste streams, and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle. In the United States, the Obama administration <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> President Bush's plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research.

25|$|After a lap {{behind the}} safety car, the field were let loose {{again at the}} {{beginning}} of lap three. Vernay closed in on his Italian team-mate, slipstreaming past him on the run to the Mandarin, and doing enough to hold off Mortara into Lisboa. For the ensuing laps, Vernay was doing {{what he had to do}} to keep his team-mate, who had <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> GP2 to rid himself of his close defeat to Keisuke Kunimoto in the previous year's race. Further back, Bianchi, who had avoided the first lap incidents was quietly moving his way up the field, and was eleventh by the end of lap seven. Sims had also dropped to the tail of the field, after a move on Cozzolino failed, and he made an unscheduled trip up the Lisboa escape road. Mortara started charging back towards Vernay, and in the process, broke the Frenchman's lap record set the day before. Mortara lowered it to a lap of 2:10.732, lapping the circuit at close to 105mph, and well under the previous record held by Marko Asmer. Cozzolino exited the race on lap eleven, crashing at Black Sands without the need for the safety car to reappear.|$|E
