This small reptile {{may have}} had long paired feather-like scales on its back, however {{it has been more}} {{recently}} argued that the scales form just a single dorsal frill. If paired, they may have been used for parachuting. [...] "Everything you can make out is consistent with it being a small, tree-living, gliding animal, which is precisely the thing you'd expect birds to evolve out of," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Larry</b> Martin, senior curator at the Natural History Museum at the University of Kansas.|$|E

They were greatly impressed: everyone of those men believes in me and will vote for me when the question of selecting a candidate comes up. After all, whatever you <b>say,</b> <b>Larry,</b> they like an Englishman. They feel they can trust him, I suppose.|$|R

5000|$|... "Sippy Cup" [...] (Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Noah's Umbrella) - Larry {{goes to a}} fancy {{restaurant}} and asks {{for a glass of}} grape juice. The waiter (Mr. Lunt) refuses because Larry has spilled grape juice several times in the past and ultimately forces Larry to use a sippy cup. Larry tries to argue his case with the waiter, busboy (Jimmy), and maître d' (Madame Blueberry), but they insist that Larry use the sippy cup. When a courtroom judge (Mr. Nezzer) is about to pass the sippy cup sentence, the governor calls in and <b>says</b> that <b>Larry</b> can have his grape juice in a glass... which he promptly spills. When the title card appears again, <b>Larry</b> <b>says</b> he will take the sippy cup.|$|R

5000|$|In 2008, Christian rock {{historian}} John J. Thompson wrote, [...] "It {{is certainly}} no overstatement to <b>say</b> that <b>Larry</b> Norman is to Christian music what John Lennon is to rock & roll or Bob Dylan is to folk music." [...] Thompson credited Norman for his {{impact on the}} genre as a musician, a producer, and a businessman. Steve Camp, Carolyn Arends, Bob Hartman, TobyMac, Mark Salomon, Martyn Joseph, and Steve Scott. Black Francis of the Pixies is also a fan of Norman's work.

50|$|At {{the pit of}} his despair, Larry {{writes a}} book titled A Guide for the Lonely Guy, which is rampantly {{successful}} and catapults him into an entirely different experience of life. He becomes rich and famous and even his relationship with Iris can begin on a new basis. Unfortunately, Iris's insecurities return, <b>saying</b> that <b>Larry</b> is now too good for her. She leaves him twice, once after {{they try to make}} love and again when they bump into each other on a cruise, where she falls in love with another friend of Larry, Jack (Steve Lawrence).|$|R
6000|$|To <b>say</b> {{that both}} <b>Larry</b> and {{his old friend}} were {{surprised}} at the sudden demand which had been made upon them would be to put the truth very mildly. They had been of the firm belief that the insurgents had retreated, and to {{find themselves in a}} [...] "reg'lar hornet's nest," [...] as Luke afterward expressed it, dumfounded them.|$|R
50|$|Using the {{information}} from Charlie's analysis, Don visits the McCrary family. He learns that McCrary's son Matt (Johnny Simmons) thought that his family was {{not doing enough to}} stop molesters after his sister Katie's rape and murder, so Matt contacted someone in a support group to discuss non-violent ways of vengeance. Megan interviews Mrs. Tillman again and realizes that her husband, Scott, molested their daughter. The team learns of a new victim and finds the house where he is being held. Inside, they find the victim being held hostage by Mrs. Tillman, and the agents arrest both people. After the arrest, the team and Charlie <b>says</b> goodbye to <b>Larry</b> at the office.

5|$|The two are chased into a cinema {{where they}} climb {{out onto the}} marquee and have a brief {{standoff}} with the police.

5000|$|Meanwhile, Bart has {{possession}} of Larry the Lamb, a stuffed sheep toy that each child in Mrs. Krabappel's room takes a turn caring {{for over a}} weekend, much {{to the dismay of}} Nelson, who <b>says</b> that <b>Larry</b> was [...] "all that kept me sane" [...] in song. Bart resents the stuffed toy, so Lisa offers to take care of him. However, she accidentally loses Larry down a storm drain. Bart goes in to retrieve him, and is chased by sewer rats and sewer cats before finding Larry atop a pipe. Bart uses Larry to slide to safety but the toy rips and Bart unceremoniously crashes through a grate to a beach, where Agnes Skinner (who all this time has heard the children calling out for [...] "Larry") tells Bart to [...] "Give him my number.

5000|$|In response, Larry {{devoted a}} chapter in his book GIT-R-DONE to Cross and the [...] "PC left", {{claiming}} that Cross had [...] "screwed with my fans, {{it was time for}} me to <b>say</b> something". <b>Larry</b> claimed that Rolling Stone was baiting comedians to attack him, and they turned to Cross only after Lewis Black refused (due to the fact that Larry and Lewis are good friends). Cross responded with An Open Letter to Larry the Cable Guy posted on his website. He continued to mock Larry in his stand-up, satirizing Blue Collar TV during a guest appearance on Wonder Showzen. In December 2005, he ended his performance on Comedy Central's Last Laugh '05 by mockingly yelling Larry's catchphrase, [...] "GIT-R-DONE!", to the audience as he left the stage.

5000|$|... "What this {{interpretation}} makes clear, though, is that Mr. Kramer {{is truly a}} playwright {{as well as a}} pamphleteer (and, some might add, a self-promoter). Seen some 25 years on, The Normal Heart turns out to be about much more than the one-man stand of Ned Weeks, the writer who takes it upon himself to warn gay men about AIDS (before it was even identified as such) and alienates virtually everyone he comes across. Ned Weeks — need I <b>say?</b> — is <b>Larry</b> Kramer, with a thoroughness that few onstage alter-egos can claim." ...|$|R
50|$|Recently, several cows {{belonging}} to local rancher Larry Ludecky (Larry Gene Darnell) {{have been found}} dead. Harlan suspects {{that they have been}} killed by coyotes, but rules that out upon examining the cows. <b>Larry</b> <b>says</b> {{that he is going to}} wait with a rifle and shoot the animals who have been killing his cows if they return. Disregarding a warning from Harlan, Larry goes ahead with his plan, and is killed by a pack of dogs. Shortly afterward, dogs also kill a SU student and an elderly lady who walks outside to investigate the ruckus.|$|R
60|$|It is not {{necessary}} to enlarge upon the preliminaries. We need hardly <b>say</b> that <b>Larry</b> washed off the mud, and that he passed flattering remarks upon his own abilities and prowess, and, in very irreverent tones and terms, addressed Ah-wow, who smoked his pipe and looked at him. All that, and a great deal more, we leave to our reader's well-known and vivid imagination. Suffice it that the venison was duly washed, and a huge fire, with much difficulty, kindled, and a number of large stones put into it to heat. This done, Larry cut off a lump of meat from the haunch--a good deal larger than his own head, which wasn't small--the skin with the hair on being cut off along with the meat. A considerable margin of flesh was then pared off from the lump, so as to leave an edging of hide all round, which might overlap the remainder, and enclose it, as it were, in a natural bag.|$|R

40|$|Many of the assays {{produced}} in the diagnostics field today take advantage of molecular labeling. Are you a coach {{who wants to know}} if your player is taking a performance-enhancing drug? A doctor interested in the disease status of your patient? Or, a TSA official won-dering if there are explosives in a bag? Label it! But as diseases, drugs, and other threats evade our detection sys-tems, researchers are not consigning themselves to label-based techniques. Labeling a molecule can interfere with its reactivity. “When you get into proteins and glycopro-teins, it becomes more difficult to make label material,” <b>says</b> Dr. <b>Larry</b> Bowers, Chief Science Officer for the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). 3 “Label-free biosensing is clearly very important. ” The community is listening and has put its energy into the field of label-free diagnosticmethods to improve the sensitivity and quality of detection.

60|$|The {{day that}} {{followed}} was one which <b>Larry</b> <b>says</b> {{he will never}} forget, and for good reason.

Time and again he cried out, but the only answer that came back was the echo from the cliff, repeating his own words as if in mockery. Occasionally he heard firing at a great distance, but toward nightfall even this died out. He could scarcely move from his resting-place, and it was not until darkness came on that the pain in his ankle subsided sufficiently to allow of his sleeping in comfort.|$|R
