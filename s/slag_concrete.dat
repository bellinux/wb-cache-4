Traditionally, blastfurnace slag {{has been used}} in concrete but recently a new product called Ground Granulated Corex Slag (GGCS) has become available on the market in the Western Cape Province. The objective of this research is to characterise the properties of this new product in concrete. In this study, the properties of corex <b>slag</b> <b>concrete</b> were compared to normal blastfurnace slag and plain CEM I concretes. A series of mixes was undertaken, with water:binder ratios varying between 0. 4 and 0. 3, and slag replacement levels between 30 and 70 %. The physical characterisation of corex slag revealed that the material is finer than blastfurnace slag, having more ultra-fine particles. The oxide analysis showed that the higher proportions of the calcium and magnesium oxides present in corex slag increase the potential for hydraulic activity of the binder compared with blastfurnace slag. The investigation of the fresh concrete properties revealed that the consistence of concrete increases with the use of slag, especially at higher water:binder ratios. Blastfurnace slag performed marginally better than corex slag. The use of slag generally increased the setting time of the paste, with pastes containing corex slag having a shorter final setting time than those containing blastfurnace slag. The setting time was also found to increase with increasing stag replacement level. The increase in setting time caused the bleed time of <b>slag</b> <b>concrete</b> to increase but the total bleed volume was significantly reduced. The bleed properties of concrete were improved when corex slag was used. It was found that the compressive strength of the new cementitious material lagged behind that of CEM I controls during early ages but after seven days, corex <b>slag</b> <b>concrete</b> showed higher strength. The strength was observed to decrease with increasing water:binder ratio. From the compressive strength results, it was deduced that the optimum corex slag substitution rate varied with water:binder ratio, ranging from 45 to 60 % The elastic modulus of corex <b>slag</b> <b>concrete</b> was found to be equal to or higher than CEM I concrete, especially at low water:binder ratios (wtb = 0. 4). Deformation experiments showed that corex <b>slag</b> <b>concrete</b> had the lowest creep and shrinkage strains of all the concretes at low water:binder ratios. At higher water:binder ratios, however, the shrinkage strains were in the same range as the other two materials. Prediction models were also assessed and it was found that no model was able to accurately predict both creep and shrinkage. Generally, the shrinkage predictions were more accurate. Durability index tests showed that corex <b>slag</b> <b>concrete</b> has good to excellent potential durability, based on historical data. Marine exposure testing indicated that corex slag binds a substantial amount of chlorides, hence reducing the risk of corrosion in marine environments. Furthermore, the risk of carbonation-induced corrosion is also decreased. Expansion associated with alkali-silica reaction is minimised with the use of corex slag and the efficiency of the material increases with replacement level.

40|$|The {{durability}} of concrete {{is one of}} the most concerns of researchers andengineers. Early ages are the time concrete suffers from many factors those inducecracking in the concrete. Microcracking in concrete adversely affects macroscopic tensilestrength of concrete that will leads to the severe cracking in later ages. Especially with theaddition of mineral additives such as ground granulated blast furnace slag or fly ash,concrete is susceptible to microcracking particularly under temperature variation. Thesemicrocracks must be one of the causes of severe macrocracks observed in real structuresusing <b>slag</b> <b>concrete.</b> Not only microcracking, chloride attack {{is one of the}} main factors lowering the{{durability of}} concrete structures, particularly for the structures in very cold region, wheredeicing agent is frequently used in winter. Deicing agent can cause severe deterioration ofconcrete structures such as scaling, corrosion of steels, and ASR. This study deals with improvement of cracking and chloride penetration resistanceof slag and fly ash concrete by using a new type of cement named high alite cement (HAC). HAC is newly developed Portland cement with very high alite (3 CaO. SiO 2) content andalmost no belite (2 CaO. SiO 2). Due to its sensitivity and the rich information it yields from collected parameters,the acoustic emission (AE) technique has been widely used to detect cracking in hardenedconcrete. Nevertheless, AE measurement at a very early age is difficult because AE sensorscannot be directly attached on the surface of unhardened concrete. Therefore, a waveguideembedded inside concrete has been employed. Unfortunately, attenuation of acousticwaves in high moisture content ambient led to the diminished effectiveness of thewaveguide in detecting AE signals in concrete with high water to binder ratio (W/B). One part of the research is to solve the problem of attenuation. An addition of twoperpendicular bars on main rod of the waveguide was proposed. Due to these wings, thedistance from cracking points in concrete to waveguide was significantly reduced. It wasproved that the redesigned waveguide worked more effectively than the previous one,especially in concrete with high W/B. By using this redesigned waveguide, microcracking was intensively investigatedin <b>slag</b> <b>concrete</b> with W/B of 0. 3 and 0. 5 subjected to temperature history simulating steamcuring. In all types of concrete, the replacement ratio of slag for cement was 50 %. Becausethe coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of materials is one of the important parametersaffecting microcracking in concrete, two types of coarse aggregate with the samemaximum particle size of 19 mm but remarkably different CTEs, namely limestone andandesite were used in the study. The test results showed that net shrinkage of HAC mortar with W/B of 0. 3 wasmuch larger than that of OPC mortar because of its larger autogenous shrinkage. Normally,larger shrinkage of mortar results in more extensive cracking in concrete. However, thenumber and the degree of microcracks in HAC <b>slag</b> <b>concrete</b> with W/B of 0. 3 were smallerthan those in OPC <b>slag</b> <b>concrete.</b> This means that HAC <b>slag</b> <b>concrete</b> with W/B of 0. 3 obviously achieved larger resistance against microcrack than OPC <b>slag</b> <b>concrete.</b> On theother hand, net shrinkage of HAC mortar with W/B of 0. 5 was a bit smaller than that ofOPC mortar due to its smaller thermal contraction. Therefore, microcracking in HAC slagconcrete with W/B of 0. 5 was also smaller than that in OPC <b>slag</b> <b>concrete.</b> The interesting characteristic of HAC explored in the research is that it couldimprove resistance against microcracking in <b>slag</b> <b>concrete.</b> AE data revealed HACconcretes could disperse tensile stress, leading to the formation of many small cracks ratherthan concentrating tensile stress to create a severe crack. Evenly distributed calciumhydroxide (CH) crystals acting as a kind of buffer that prevents the propagation ofmicrocracks in HAC <b>slag</b> <b>concrete</b> might be one of the reasons. Another reason for the highcracking resistance of HAC <b>slag</b> <b>concrete</b> was the strong bond between mortar and coarseaggregate. This high bond strength was more clearly observed in concrete with low W/Bthan in concrete with high W/B. The high bond strength of HAC <b>slag</b> <b>concrete</b> was verifiedthrough tensile strength test, AE test, visual observation, and scanning electron microscopeimages. The strong bond in HAC slag concretes might be due to the formation ofsecondary CSH gel from the reaction of CH and active SiO 2 in slag at pores near theinterface transition zone. The effects of fly ash on the microcracking resistance of concrete subjected totemperature variation at very young ages were also investigated by AE, physical and mechanical tests. Fly ash was used as a cementitious material as well as fine aggregate. Inaddition, a combination of fly ash and HAC, which was effective in improving resistanceagainst microcracking in <b>slag</b> <b>concrete,</b> was studied. Concrete containing fly ash was not so weak against elevated temperature. Nevertheless, fly ash reduced tensile strength of concrete remarkably. The reason is that flyash is not so active in early ages even under steam curing. It is found that HAC can significantly improve tensile strength of concretecontaining fly ash due to high hydration rate of HAC. However, high bond strength in HAC fly ash concrete was not observed from the direct tensile test as in HAC <b>slag</b> <b>concrete.</b> Further research is necessary to clarify the cracking resistance of fly ash concrete. Another important part of the research is to show the effectiveness of HAC toimprove the resistance against chloride ingress of concrete containing additives by using HAC. The effectiveness was analyzed by Surface Water Absorption Test (SWAT) andwater/chloride penetration depth test. Four types of binder were used: OPC, HAC, slag,and fly ash. Concrete with OPC only was the control mix. In other mixes, the cementswere replaced by slag or fly ash with the replacement ratios of 40 % or 15 % by mass,respectively. Coarse aggregate of andesite with maximum particle size of 19 mm was used. Air content of concrete was controlled at 6 ? 0. 5 % to prevent concrete from scaling underfreeze/thaw cycles. In order to obtain a wide range of concrete quality, three W/B of 0. 4, 0. 5, and 0. 6 and five curing conditions covering from very good to very poor conditionwere applied. Three-binder concretes containing slag and fly ash with W/B of 0. 4 werealso prepared. To investigate the effect of bond on mass transfer in concrete, someconcretes made with limestone were added in the cases of concrete with W/B of 0. 4 and 0. 5. Experimental results presented that there were good correlations between waterabsorption rate at 10 minutes (p 600) and penetration depth of water and chloride ions in allkinds of concrete. It means that SWAT can be applied to evaluate the resistance againstmass transfer into concrete. The same linear relationship was observed between the waterpenetration depth and p 600 regardless of the type of binder. It means that p 600 is related to akind of governing characteristic regarding the microstructure of concrete, which should be studied further. The effects of curing conditions were fully reflected in SWAT results. Iflinear lines expressing the correlations between SWAT index and parameters related todurability of concrete such as penetration depth of water or chloride ion, carbonation depth,etc. are established, SWAT index can be used as an indicator of durability of concretestructures. This is very significant because SWAT is a simple, automatic, and rapid methodand it is easy to be applied for concrete structures in actual sites. It is found that slag or fly ash could improve the resistance against chlorideingress of concrete remarkably due to the chloride binding ability of C 3 A componentexisting in slag and fly ash. However, OPC concretes containing additives were much moresensitive to curing conditions than concretes with OPC only. Owing to the high hydration rate of C 3 S, HAC slag/fly ash concrete was lesssensitive to curing conditions than OPC slag/fly ash. Thus, HAC should be utilized withslag or fly ash in concrete structures subjected to severe conditions...|$|E

For such concretes to be implemented in large scale concrete applications such as infrastructural and building elements, {{it is essential to}} understand its early and long-term performance characteristics vis-à-vis conventional ordinary portland cement (OPC) based concretes. This paper presents a comprehensive study of the property and performance features including early-age isothermal calorimetric response, compressive strength development with time, microstructural features such as the pore volume and representative pore size, and accelerated chloride transport resistance of OPC and alkali-activated binder systems. Slag mixtures activated using sodium silicate solution (SiO 2 -to-Na 2 O ratio or Ms of 1 – 2) to provide a total alkalinity of 0.05 (Na 2 O-to-binder ratio) are compared with OPC mixtures with and without partial cement replacement with Class F fly ash (20  % by mass) or silica fume (6  % by mass). Major similarities are noted between these binder systems for: (1) calorimetric response with respect to the presence of features even though the locations and peaks vary based on Ms, (2) compressive strength and its development, (3) total porosity and pore size, and (4) rapid chloride permeability and non-steady state migration coefficients. Moreover, electrical impedance based circuit models are used to bring out the microstructural features (resistance of the connected pores, and capacitances of the solid phase and pore-solid interface) that are similar in conventional OPC and alkali-activated <b>slag</b> <b>concretes.</b> This study thus demonstrates that performance-equivalent alkali-activated slag systems that are more sustainable from energy and environmental standpoints can be proportioned.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Alkali-activated slag (AAS) binders {{have lower}} {{environmental}} impact {{due to its}} production process, but also have disadvantages as an increased shrinkage followed by formation of microcracks. The effect of polymer admixtures based on vinyl acetate, ethylene and acrylic acid ester, methyl metacrylate and different types of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) on properties of alkali-activated <b>slag</b> <b>concrete</b> was studied. Admixtures used for mortars were tested to improve shrinkage, workability and compressive strength, flexural strength.

However, the cracking tendency of AASC under drying conditions, when restrained, is unreported. AASC has lower elastic modulus, higher creep, and higher tensile strength than OPCC, and the combined {{effects of these}} can affect the cracking tendency of AASC. This article reports the results of cracking tendency utilizing restrained ring tests and discusses {{the development of a}} restrained beam test. The effects of curing, aggregate type, and incorporation of shrinkage reducing chemical admixture on the cracking tendency of AASC are reported...|$|E
40|$|Some constructions {{built with}} <b>slag</b> cement <b>concrete</b> exhibit {{cracking}} at early age due to restrained shrinkage. To determine the slag effect on cracking, this study {{focuses on the}} autogenous deformation evolution of concretes characterized by different percentages of slag (0 and 42 % of the binder mass) under free and restraint conditions {{by means of the}} TSTM device (Temperature Stress Testing Machine). Despite the fast kinetics of its autogenous deformation, the cracking appears later for the <b>slag</b> cement <b>concrete</b> than for the Portland cement concrete. This behaviour is related to the swelling of its cementitious matrix at early age and its large capacity for relaxing the stresses. © 2011 Lavoisier, Paris.

40|$|The {{strength}} and durability performance of normal- and high-strength pozzolanic concretes incorporating silica fume, fly ash, and {{blast furnace slag}} was compared at elevated temperatures up to 800 °C. The strength properties were determined using an unstressed residual compressive strength test, while durability was investigated by rapid chloride diffusion test, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and crack pattern observations. It was found that pozzolanic concretes containing fly ash and blast furnace slag give the best performance particularly at temperatures below 600 °C {{as compared to the}} pure cement concretes. Explosive spalling occurred in most high-strength concretes (HSCs) containing silica fume. A distributed network of fine cracks was observed in all fly ash and blast furnace <b>slag</b> <b>concretes,</b> but no spalling or splitting occurred. The high-strength pozzolanic concretes showed a severe loss in permeability-related durability than the compressive strength loss. Thirty percent replacement of cement by fly ash in HSC and 40 % replacement of cement by blast furnace <b>slag</b> in normal-strength <b>concrete</b> (NSC) was found to be optimal to retain maximum {{strength and}} durability after high temperatures.
