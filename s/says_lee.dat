2500|$|Lee {{was born}} on July 29, 1953 in Willowdale, (North York) Toronto, Ontario, to Morris and Mary Weinrib (née Manya Rubenstein). His parents were Jewish Holocaust {{survivors}} from Poland who had survived the ghetto in their hometown Starachowice, followed by their imprisonments at Dachau and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, during the Holocaust and World War II. They were about 13 years old when they were initially imprisoned at Auschwitz concentration camp, close to {{the same age as}} Anne Frank at that time. [...] "It was kind of surreal pre-teen shit," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Lee,</b> describing how his father bribed guards to bring his mother shoes. After a period, his mother was transferred to Bergen-Belsen and his father to Dachau. When the war ended four years later and the Allies liberated the camps, his father set out in search of his mother and found her at a displaced persons camp. They married there and eventually emigrated to Canada.|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{somewhat}} supported President Johnson's plan of Reconstruction. In 1866 Lee counseled southerners not {{to resume}} fighting, of which Grant said Lee was [...] "setting {{an example of}} forced acquiescence so grudging and pernicious in its effects as to be hardly realized". Lee joined with Democrats in opposing the Radical Republicans who demanded punitive measures against the South, distrusted its commitment to {{the abolition of slavery}} and, indeed, distrusted the region's loyalty to the United States. Lee supported a system of free public schools for blacks, but forthrightly opposed allowing blacks to vote. [...] "My own opinion is that, at this time, they [...] cannot vote intelligently, and that giving them the [...] would lead to a great deal of demagogism, and lead to embarrassments in various ways," [...] Lee stated. Emory Thomas <b>says</b> <b>Lee</b> had become a suffering Christ-like icon for ex-Confederates. President Grant invited him to the White House in 1869, and he went. Nationally he became an icon of reconciliation between the North and South, and the reintegration of former Confederates into the national fabric.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the filming}} of the Kung Fu TV movie began, there was some {{discussion}} {{as to whether or}} not an Asian actor should play Kwai Chang Caine. Bruce Lee was considered for the role. In 1971, Bruce Lee wasn't the cult film hero he later became for his roles in The Big Boss (1971), Fist of Fury (1972), Way of the Dragon (1972) and Enter the Dragon (1973). At that point he was best known as Kato on TV's Green Hornet (1966–1967) (Kung Fu guest actor Robert Ito reports that Lee hated the role of Kato because he [...] "thought it was so subservient"). [...] "In my eyes and in the eyes of Jerry Thorpe," [...] says Harvey Frand, [...] "David Carradine was always our first choice to play Caine. But there was some disagreement because the network was interested in a more muscular actor and the studio was interested in getting Bruce Lee." [...] Frand <b>says</b> <b>Lee</b> wouldn't have really been appropriate for the series—despite the fact that he went on to considerable success in the martial arts film world. The Kung Fu show needed a serene person, and Carradine was more appropriate for the role. Ed Spielman agrees: [...] "I liked David in the part. One of Japan's foremost Karate champions used to say that the only qualification that was needed to be trained in the martial arts was that you had to know how to dance. And on top of being an accomplished athlete and actor, David could dance." [...] Nonetheless, grumbling from the Asian community would have made sense, given the fact that major roles for Asian actors were almost nonexistent. James Hong, an actor on the show and ex-president of the Association of Asian/Pacific American Artists (AAPAA) says that at the time Asian actors felt that [...] "if they were going to do a so-called Asian hero on Kung Fu, then why don't they hire an Asian actor to play the lead? But then the show went on, we realized that it was a great source of employment for the Asian acting community." [...] In fact, Hong says, Carradine had a good relationship with the Asian community.|$|E

Christine and Lee aren’t allowed to call Aunt Ida “mom” because she tells them was never married and feels it’s not right. Christine is attracted to her brother's friend Dayton.

6000|$|At length on the 28th of June, the Thunder Bomb {{commenced}} the attack, throwing shells at {{the fort}} as the fleet, under Sir Peter Parker, advanced. About eleven o'clock the ships dropped their anchors directly before the front battery. ["They commenced," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Lee,</b> [...] "the most furious fire I ever saw." [...] The garrison, however, according to British authority, {{stuck with the}} greatest constancy and firmness to their guns; fired deliberately and slow, and took a cool, effective aim. The ships suffered accordingly, they were torn almost to pieces, and the slaughter was dreadful. The fire from the ships did not produce the expected effect.] The fortifications were low, composed of earth and palmetto wood, which is soft, and makes no splinters, and the merlons were extremely thick. At one {{time there was a}} considerable pause in the American fire, and the enemy thought the fort was abandoned. It was only because the powder was exhausted. As soon as a supply could be forwarded from the mainland by General Lee, the fort resumed its fire with still more deadly effect. Through unskilful pilotage, several of the ships ran aground, where one, the frigate Actæon, remained; the rest were extricated with difficulty. Those which bore the brunt of the action were much cut up. One hundred and seventy-five men were killed, and nearly as many wounded. Sir Henry Clinton, with two thousand troops and five or six hundred seamen, attempted repeatedly to cross from Long Island, and co-operate in the attack upon the fort, but was as often foiled by Colonel Thompson, with his battery of two cannons, and a body of South Carolina rangers and North Carolina regulars.|$|E

Despite the obvious appeal of Moody's comedy of familial errors, Lee stated that what attracted him to the book was its climax: the scene where Ben Hood makes a shocking discovery in the ice, followed by the emotional reunion of the Hood family on the morning after the storm.

Soon Mick Harris (then member of a psychobilly band) joined the lineup and they shifted from metal to grindcore. [...] "Nick and I left Napalm Death after we recorded the first side of Scum. I'd had enough of Napalm Death very, very quickly", he <b>says.</b> <b>Lee</b> Dorrian and Jim Whitely joined to replace Bullen and Broadrick.

50|$|Even {{though this}} Act {{seems to have}} granted no {{concessions}} to Chinese immigrants whatsoever, historians such as Elmer Clarence Sandmeyer have noted that many Californians were disappointed that the Act did not achieve total exclusion. Although the Act stated that these certificates - as well as similar “certificates of identity” later created by the then newly formed Bureau of Immigration to document all Chinese who were actually exempt from the Exclusion and subsequent Geary Acts (for example merchants, teachers, travelers, and students) - were supposed to serve as “indubitable proof of legal entry”, the documents did not function to protect legal immigrants and residents from government harassment. As Erika Lee describes, because the Act required all Chinese to possess the certificates, the entire Chinese community in the U.S. - including immigrants and residents {{who were supposed to}} be exempt from the exclusionary laws - was exposed to the same level of constraint and inquiry governing Chinese laborers. The motivation behind this unprecedented level of inquiry, <b>says</b> <b>Lee,</b> was quite bluntly due to the prejudiced view that it was, as Senator Geary himself stated, “impossible to identify one Chinaman another”. No other immigrant group were required to hold documents proving their lawful residence until 1928, when ‘immigrant identification cards’ were first issued to any new immigrant arriving for permanent residence (these were replaced by green cards, officially alien registration receipt cards, after 1940), a fact that Lee calls “gatekeeping” and sees as rooted in “a western American desire to sustain white supremacy in a multiracial West”.|$|E

Lana asks Lee why, despite offers from many major news outlets, Lee picked her, and Lee responds that she thought Lana would be more sympathetic given her history with atrocities.

Lana invites Lee to speak to Flora directly and Lee does, saying she hopes one day Flora can understand and forgive her for what she has done. Lana asks point blank about Flora's whereabouts, informing a shocked Lee that Flora went missing earlier that day, accusing Lee of having taken her.
