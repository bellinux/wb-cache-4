In addition, some fans were upset that and Flansburgh and Linnell opted to use a backing band for the album's tour, with some even boycotting shows.|$|E

During the first match, he scored the opening goal and assisted another in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast.

5|$|White {{was drafted}} by the Fremantle Dockers as the number 1pick, which Fremantle were granted by the AFL because 1995 was the club's first season in the competition. White made his debut in Round3 of Fremantle's inaugural season in a victory over Fitzroy. He played six matches in 1995, kicking three goals but {{averaging}} less than three hit-outs per game. The 1996 season saw him play 13matches and kick 13goals and greatly improve his average number of disposals. He was nominated for the AFL Rising Star award in Round19 in a 24-point win against Collingwood. He had 22disposals, 11marks, kicked a goal and received three Brownlow Medal votes for his <b>stand-out</b> performance for the season. In his final season at Fremantle, White took on greater responsibility of the ruck-work, and averaged 10hit-outs per game for the season. He played the first 12matches of the season, but was then dropped for nine matches until the final match of the season—and of his Fremantle career. Fremantle's performances were largely consistent during White's three seasons with them, as they finished 13th in both 1995 and 1996, and 12th in 1997.|$|E
5|$|John played {{infrequently}} for Cardiff {{during the}} 1968/69 season, making just 14 appearances. Despite this he {{was available for}} all matches in the 1969 Five Nations Championship, again playing in each match paired with Edwards. The Welsh selectors had dropped five players from the previous Championship, and notable debutants in the team to face Scotland at Murrayfield on 1 February 1969 were J.P.R. Williams and Mervyn Davies. John scored his first international try in the encounter after charging down a kick and dummying his way over. Scotland, who were under enormous pressure from the kick-off, lost 17–3. When Ireland came to the Cardiff Arms Park in March the team was on a seven match unbeaten run, and were looking at taking the Grand Slam after defeating England, France and Scotland. It therefore {{came as a surprise}} at the ease with which the Welsh pack dominated. Wales won 24–11, with Dai Morris the <b>stand-out</b> Welsh player, though John also had one of his best matches, keeping pressure on the Irish with long touch kicks and scoring with a dropped goal. Despite out-scoring France in tries scored, the match at Stade Colombes ended in an 8–8 draw, preventing a Welsh Grand Slam, though a win in the final match to England would give Wales the Championship. The England decider is best remembered for Maurice Richards' four tries, but John too was on the scoresheet with a dropped goal and a try of his own. The game finished 30–9 to Wales, giving John his first Championship title and made him a Triple Crown winning player, as Wales had beaten all three other Home Nation teams.|$|E
