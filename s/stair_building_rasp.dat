Both Canon and Civil Law were taught, however by the sixteenth Century, instruction {{in both of these}} had fallen out of practice. It was during this time that James Dalrymple of Stair came to Glasgow to study for an M.A. (1633-1637) and then became a regent (1641-1647) teaching philosophy. He went on to become Lord President of the Court of Session in 1671, and published his Institutions of the Law of Scotland in 1681, the first systematic exposition of Scots Law. The <b>Stair</b> <b>Building,</b> where the School of Law is housed, is named in his honour.|$|R

50|$|John B. Parkinson (12 December 1861 - 9 December 1935) {{was born}} in the small village of Scorton, in Lancashire, England in 1861. At the age of sixteen, he was apprenticed for six years to Jonas J. Bradshaw, an {{architect}} and engineer in nearby Bolton, where he learned craftsmanship and practical construction. He attended night school at Bolton's Mechanics Institute to study architectural drafting and engineering. Upon completion of his apprenticeship at age 21, he immigrated to North America as an adventure; he built fences in Winnipeg and learned <b>stair</b> <b>building</b> in Minneapolis. He returned to England only to discover that the English construction trades demanded more time and service for advancement. He decided that his then capabilities would be more appropriate to the less-structured opportunities in America. Parkinson went to California, settling in Napa where he again worked as a stair-builder, and he took on architectural commissions in his spare time.|$|R
5000|$|SNRC {{purchased}} Black Chasm Cavern in 1996 {{and began}} offering 5 hour expedition trips, including rappelling, rafting, climbing, and crawling through the wild {{areas of the}} cave. These trips ran for four summers before damage to the delicate areas of the cave was deemed too steep a price to continue offering tours through the wild cave. In 1999, development began on the property, which included creating a road, septic and utility installation, and <b>building</b> storage facilities. <b>Stair</b> <b>building</b> into the cavern began in July 2000, with the first walking tours being offered on the last weekend in September 2000. The trail-building spanned just over 10 months, as the crew frequently harnessed up and used ropes for the construction process. Though introductory tours were being conducted during the stair construction period, the grand opening of Black Chasm took place in April 2001. Future plans to extend the trail will allow guests to visit twice as many chambers as are currently seen on the walking tour.|$|R

After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well.

He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice. He died in 1984. digitizedDigital imag...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether environmental prompts placed in two-story buildings on a university campus would increase <b>stair</b> usage. Three <b>buildings</b> were used. One served as a control, while the other two received an intervention. Participants of three buildings were observed taking the stairs and elevator for seven weeks. Baseline data was collected; signs were introduced, and then removed during this time period. Approximately 2700 observations were collected. Environmental prompts did not appear to increase stair usage. There were significant differences in the amount of <b>stair</b> users between <b>buildings.</b> The <b>stair</b> usage rates of this particular study were quite high compared to other studies. A ceiling effect may have contributed to the lack of significant change in stair usage.
