50|$|Brett {{was the son}} of a cabinetmaker, William Brett of Bristol, and {{was born}} in that city in 1805. Brett is known as the founder of {{submarine}} telegraphy. The idea of transmitting electricity through submerged cables is said to have been originated by him in conjunction with his younger brother. After some years spent in perfecting his plans he sought and obtained permission from Louis-Philippe in 1847 to establish telegraphic communication between France and England, but the project was deemed too hazardous for general support. However, he was successful in connecting the two nations briefly by undersea cable in 1850. A more durable cable was laid in 1851, and the construction of numerous other <b>submarine</b> <b>lines</b> followed. Brett always expressed himself confident as to the ultimate union of England and America by means of electricity, but he did not live to see it accomplished.|$|E
50|$|USS Butternut {{departed}} Leyte Gulf in convoy on 24 February 1947 {{and shaped}} {{a course for}} the Marianas. She arrived at Guam on 9 March and began three years of service in the Trust Territories of the Pacific Ocean Islands. Based at Apra Harbor on Guam, she carried passengers and cargo among the islands as well as laying and tending nets at various islands. The ship also performed several assignments off Iwo Jima laying mooring buoys and assisting in the recovery, repair and replacement of <b>submarine</b> <b>lines.</b> the ship departed Guam on 19 June 1950 for repairs at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. The net laying ship completed repairs and put to sea on 15 September. Steaming via Guam and Iwo Jima, she arrived in Sasebo, Japan, on 28 October. The ship conducted operations at Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan, until 7 July 1951 when she set sail for Guam to resume her former duties in the Trust Territories.|$|E

50|$|After William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone had {{introduced}} their working telegraph in 1839, {{the idea of}} a <b>submarine</b> <b>line</b> across the Atlantic Ocean began {{to be thought of as}} a possible triumph of the future. Samuel Morse proclaimed his faith in it as early as 1840, and in 1842, he submerged a wire, insulated with tarred hemp and India rubber, in the water of New York Harbor, and telegraphed through it. The following autumn, Wheatstone performed a similar experiment in Swansea Bay. A good insulator to cover the wire and prevent the electric current from leaking into the water was necessary for the success of a long <b>submarine</b> <b>line.</b> India rubber had been tried by Moritz von Jacobi, the Prussian electrical engineer, as far back as the early 19th century.|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe world’s energy {{resources}} on land are getting depleted, and mush attention {{is given to}} the development of offshore fields. Over the past years, new reserves located offshore have been regularly discovered. Once the hydrocarbons have been extracted, it is necessary then to transport them to the storage places, refineries or gas processing plants, and to deliver to the consumers. There are several ways of hydrocarbon transportation. One of the most cost-effective and popular means of oil and gas transportation is pipelines. Construction and operation of subsea pipelines are known to be very hazardous and risky processes. In order to ensure reliable and safe operation of <b>submarine</b> <b>lines,</b> it is essential to design them according to the international standards and codes. However, observance of rules sometimes does not guarantee safe pipeline operation. Some undesirable events can occur from time to rime. One of such events is dragging anchor incident, which poses great threat to the subsea lines. The consequences of this incident may be huge, involving environmental pollution, asset losses and even fatality. The mitigation of these outcomes becomes problematic, expensive and impossible. That is why it is recommended to carry out relevant investigations before the mitigation measures are planned and implemented. This work is mainly focused on the anchor damage assessment of subsea pipelines. The comprehensive discussion on a PARLOC 2001 database is done in order to determine major pipeline incidents, their causes and consequences. The questions regarding pipe-anchor interaction scenario have been studied a lot. It has been found that the extent of pipeline damage is heavily dependent on its unique properties. In addition, not only the pipeline data, but also a combination of vessel characteristics and anchoring equipment parameters has been very useful for the analyses. Based on the results of AIS ship traffic data processing, main pipe damage criteria checks have been performed. The findings indicate that not all the anchors have potential of hooking and approaching the pipeline resting on the seafloor. Key parameters here are anchor class (size), chain length, ship speed and water depth. Moreover, the geometrical configuration of all the anchors has been taken into account as well. Not only a theoretical approach, but a model scale test has been carried out {{in order to understand the}} variation of anchor towing depth with different ship velocities. The comparison of analytical solution results with the experimental results is also included in this thesis. Anchor pulling consequences are established in accordance with the global scale analyses performed in the FE program SIMLA for a certain number of sensitivity cases for both small (16 -inch) and large (40 -inch) diameter pipelines. The pipelines responses have been determined, and their cross-sectional capacities have been checked. In addition, pipelines failure frequencies have been estimated. This work shows how critical it is to have detailed ship and equipment class data for doing pipeline integrity assessment. In accordance with the results obtained, the dragging anchor interference assessment methodology is developed...|$|E

From this point forward, Newall was instrumental in developing substantial improvements to submarine telegraph cables, devising a method involving the use of gutta percha surrounded by strong wires. The first successful cable, laid between Dover and Calais on 25 Sept. 1851, was turned out from his works, and he continued the manufacture on a large scale. In 1853 he invented the ‘brake-drum’ and cone for laying cables in deep seas. Owing to the scarcity of engineers competent {{to deal with the}} special difficulties of the work, Newall himself directed the submergence of many of his cables. Among these were the lines from Holyhead to Howth, Dover to Ostend, Malta to Corfu, besides several others in the Mediterranean, Suez to Aden, Aden to Kurrachee, Constantinople and Varna to Balaclava in 1855. Half of the first Atlantic cable was manufactured at his works.
