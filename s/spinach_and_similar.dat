40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Belgium, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), compiled an application to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance indoxacarb in rucola, cress, land cress, red mustard, other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> (leaves). In order to accommodate for the intended uses of indoxacarb, Belgium proposed to raise the existing MRLs from the limit of quantification to 1 mg/kg. Belgium drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 1 mg/kg for the proposed uses on rucola, cress, land cress, red mustard, other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> (leaves). Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of indoxacarb on the commodities under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of indoxacarb on rucola, cress, land cress, red mustard, other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> (leaves) will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Belgium, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), compiled an application to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance thiacloprid in <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> leaves crop group. In order to accommodate the intended indoor and outdoor uses of thiacloprid in Belgium, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for thiacloprid in <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> leaves group or only in spinach and beet leaves to 0. 15 mg/kg. Belgium drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the submitted residue trials data on lettuce are not sufficient to support the residue data extrapolation to the whole group of <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> leaves. Alternatively, the EMS proposed to extrapolate four outdoor residue trials data on open leaf lettuce to spinach and beet leaves only. Although this extrapolation is not explicitly mentioned in the European guidance document, EFSA is of the opinion that the proposal is acceptable, considering the morphological similarities between spinach/beet leaves and open leave varieties of lettuce and taking into account that spinach and beet leaves are minor crops. Thus, a MRL proposal of 0. 15 mg/kg is derived. Based on the risk assessment results EFSA concludes that the intended use of thiacloprid on spinach and beet leaves will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, France received an application {{from the company}} Syngenta Agro SAS to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance azoxystrobin in lettuce, spinach, celery and cardoon. In order to accommodate for the intended use of azoxystrobin, France proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 15 mg/kg for <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar,</b> lettuces and other salad plants, celery and cardoon. Germany received an application from the plant protection service Landesamt für Landwirtschaft, Forsten und Gartenbau des Landes Sachesen-Anhalt to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance azoxystrobin in spices. In order to accommodate for the intended use Germany proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 0. 3 mg/kg for spices/seeds and spices/fruits and berries. Belgium compiled an application to modify the existing MRL for the azoxystrobin in rhubarb. In order to accommodate for the intended use Belgium proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 0. 5 mg/kg. France, Germany and Belgium drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for lettuce, <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar,</b> cardoon, celery, rhubarb and spices. For other crops belonging {{to the group of}} lettuce and other salad plants the data were not sufficient to propose a MRL. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of azoxystrobin on the commodities under consideration at the validated LOQ of 0. 01 mg/kg. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of azoxystrobin on lettuce, spinach, celery, cardoon, spices and rhubarb will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn plants Ca 2 + plays {{a crucial}} role as second messenger. Thus calmodulin {{is one of the most}} {{important}} signal transducing molecules for metabolic regulation in plants. Previously we showed that bovine testis calmodulin can be covalently coupled at one site to ubiquitin in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner in the presence of ATP/Mg 2 + by ubiquityl-calmodulin synthetase. Since calmodulin from spinach has 13 amino acid sequence differences to bovine calmodulin - two of them in Ca 2 +-binding loops - it was unclear, whether a conjugation of ubiquitin to this molecule would be possible. In this paper it is shown that calmodulin from <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> a <b>similar</b> calmodulin from the mold Neurospora crassa can be covalently conjugated to ubiquitin in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner. It is shown that higher molecular mass conjugates containing up to three ubiquitin molecules per calmodulin are obtained. Experiments with methylated ubiquitin demonstrate that, as with vertebrate calmodulins, only one lysine residue is linked to ubiquitin and that the incorporation of addditional ubiquitin molecules leads to a polyubiquitin chain...|$|R
40|$|The {{precursor}} of the ribulose- 1, 5 -biphosphate carboxylase small subunit and other proteins from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are efficiently transported into chloroplasts isolated from <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> pea. Thus, <b>similar</b> determinants specify precursor-chloroplast interactions in the alga and vascular plants. Removal of {{all or part}} of its transit sequence was found to block important of the algal small subunit into isolated chloroplasts. Comparison of available sequences revealed a nine amino acid segment conserved in the transit sequences of all small subunit precursors. A protease in the vascular plant chloroplasts recognized this region in the Chlamydomonas precursor and produced an intermediate form of the small subunit. We propose that processing of the small subunit precursor involves at least two proteolytic events; only one of these has been evolutionarily conserved...|$|R
30|$|Water <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> okra {{are readily}} {{available}} tropical vegetables found in many countries located across the equator region. Both water <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> okra shared <b>similar</b> ecological vegetable properties as they are commonly grown edible plants. Both vegetables contain high amounts of vitamins and minerals such as phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, potassium and others which are required in our diet for a healthy living (Singh et al. 2010) and are often regarded as the daily staple diet for many people. Vegetables able to provide energy as it consists most of the essential nutrients, such as proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins and other trace elements (Itanna 2002). Even though vegetables are {{an important component of}} our daily diet, there is little information available as to its contamination by heavy metals. A common example of contamination includes bioaccumulation of heavy metals in vegetables. Bioaccumulation refers to the increase in concentration of a particular chemical or element in biological organisms over time and can pose a threat to the well-being of plants, animals and human beings (Sharma et al. 2006; Shi and Cai 2009). It is well documented that heavy metals inhibit many enzymes and thus able to disrupt metabolic processes, including photosynthesis in plants.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{precursor}} of the ribulose-l, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit and other proteins from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are efficiently transported into chloroplasts isolated from <b>spinach</b> <b>and</b> pea. Thus, <b>similar</b> determinants specify precursor-chloroplast interactions in the alga and vascular plants. Removal of {{all or part}} of its transit sequence was found to block import of the algal small subunit into isolated chloroplasts. Comparison of available sequences revealed a nine amino acid segment conserved in the transit sequences of all small subunit precursors. A protease in the vascular plant chloroplasts recognized this region in the Chlamydomonas precursor and produced an intermediate form of the small subunit. We propose that processing of the small subunit precursor involves at least two proteolytic events; only one of these has been evolutionarily conserved. Since the discovery that the nuclear-encoded small subunit of ribulose-l, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBPCase) ~ is synthesized as a higher molecular weight precursor (14) and is post-translationally imported into chloroplasts (10, 22), there has been much effort to define the molecular aspect...|$|R

These include white goosefoot (C. album), kañiwa (C. pallidicaule) and quinoa (C. quinoa). On the Greek island of Crete, tender shoots and leaves {{of a species}} called krouvida (κρουβίδα) or psarovlito (ψαρόβλητο) are eaten by the locals, boiled or steamed. As studied by Kristen Gremillion and others, goosefoots {{have a history of}} culinary use dating back to 4000 BC or earlier, when pitseed goosefoot (C. berlandieri) was a staple crop in the Native American eastern agricultural complex, and white goosefoot was apparently used by the Ertebølle culture of Europe. The Proto-Indo-Europeans of the eastern Yamna culture also harvested white goosefoot as an apparent cereal substitute to round out an otherwise mostly meat and dairy diet c. 3500-2500 BCE.|$|R
