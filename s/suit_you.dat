500|$|The Guardian {{selected}} a spontaneous {{joke about the}} South Pole made by an audience member, Khush Klare, as the [...] "undoubted highlight", having raised the loudest cheer from the audience. Klare, the son of Indian parents who migrated to Britain in the 1960s, had suggested collecting money for Griffin to be deported to the South Pole, as [...] "it's a colourless landscape that will <b>suit</b> <b>you</b> fine". Klare said that while {{he did not think}} so at first, in retrospect he thought that Question Time was the right platform for Griffin.|$|E
500|$|Jimmy Iovine, the {{chairman}} of M.I.A.'s American distribution label Interscope, compares M.I.A. to Reed and punk rock songwriter Patti Smith, and recalled, [...] "She's gonna do what she's gonna do, I can't tell her shit." [...] "The really left-of-center artists, you really wonder about them. Can the world catch up? Can the culture meet them in the middle? That’s what the adventure is. It doesn’t always happen, but it should and it could." [...] Richard Russell, head of XL Recordings, states, [...] "You've got to bend culture around to <b>suit</b> <b>you,</b> and I think M.I.A has done that" [...] adding that M.I.A.'s composition and production skills were a major attraction for him. As a vocalist, M.I.A. is recognisable by her distinctive whooping, chanting voice, which {{has been described as}} having an [...] "indelible, nursery-rhyme swing." [...] She has adopted different singing styles on her songs, from aggressive raps, to semi-spoken and melodic vocals. She has said of the sometimes [...] "unaffected" [...] vocals and delivery of her lyrics, [...] "It is what it is. Most people would just put it down to me being lazy. But at the same time, I don’t want ," [...] saying some of the [...] "raw and difficult" [...] vocal styles she used reflected what was happening to her during recording.|$|E
2500|$|Neville Hawcock for the Financial Times praises Dawkins' {{clarity in}} {{explanation}}: [...] "He really {{is very good}} at this. The chapter on rainbows has the clearest explanation of how they appear that I’ve ever seen." [...] Of the myths Dawkins uses Hawcock writes: [...] "These, straw gods set up for Dawkins to knock down, are not up to the job of accounting for reality but at least give McKean some great subject matter." [...] Meghan Cox Gurdon writing for the Wall Street Journal says: [...] "His tone throughout alternates between real delight over how things work and avuncular pity for the people who persist in seeing an author behind the machinery of the universe... There is no plan, winks Mr. Dawkins, nor any divinity. There is just the 'magic' of the universe unfolding. If that is the view you wish your children to have of the cosmos, then The Magic of Reality will <b>suit</b> <b>you</b> very well." ...|$|E

2500|$|By saying Double, the {{competition}} {{will be harder}} because the round scores will be {{twice as much as}} the normal [...] round. The Three means 3 times as much as the normal [...] round and Four means four. The main purposes of saying [...] "Double or Four" [...] is to change the way of playing and increase points, since when the game is doubled (or more) points aren't divided, the team with most points takes all. If you were playing in [...] "locked" [...] "Double or Four", the one who says [...] "Double" [...] or [...] "Four" [...] has the option of locking or opening the Hokom. In case it's locked you can't use the Judged suit as a first card in any trick, you can only use them when you don't have the suit that the other player has played, or don't have any other suit to play as a first card in the trick. Otherwise, [...] "if its Three or Gahwa" [...] you can use any <b>suit</b> <b>you</b> want, even if it was the Judged suit.|$|E
2500|$|In 1760, the betrothal {{was again}} {{brought up by}} Denmark, which {{regarded}} it {{as a matter of}} prestige. The negotiations were made between Denmark and the Swedish Queen, as King Adolf Frederick of Sweden was never considered to be of any more than purely formal importance. Louisa Ulrika favored a match between Gustav and her niece Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt instead, and claimed that she regarded the engagement to be void and forced upon her by Carl Gustaf Tessin. She negotiated with Catherine the Great and her brother Frederick the Great to create some political benefit for Denmark in exchange for a broken engagement. However, the Swedish public was very favorable to the match due to expectations Sophia Magdalena would be like the last Danish-born Queen of Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, who was very loved for her kindness and charity. This view was supported by the Caps political party, which expected Sophia Magdalena to be an example of a virtuous and religious representative of the monarchy in contrast to the haughty Louisa Ulrika. Fredrick V of Denmark was also eager to complete the match: [...] "His Danish Majesty could not have the interests of his daughter sacrificed because of the prejudices and whims of the Swedish Queen". In 1764 Crown Prince Gustav, who was at this point eager to free himself from his mother and form his own household, used the public opinion to state to his mother that he wished to honor the engagement, and on 3 April 1766, the engagement was officially celebrated. When a portrait of Sophia Magdalena was displayed in Stockholm, Louisa Ulrika commented: [...] "why Gustav, you seem to be already in love with her! She looks stupid", after which she turned to Prince Charles and added: [...] "She would <b>suit</b> <b>you</b> better!" ...|$|E
