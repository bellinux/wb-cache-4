But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E

500|$|When Robbie {{first began}} filming, {{she was told}} that Donna was bisexual. Of this Robbie said, [...] "In one of the blocks <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> to Bridget about their 'first time' and Donna asks Bridget if {{it was with a}} guy or girl? I liked the way the writers {{conveyed}} that, it was just really subtle and they didn't make a big coming out scene of it. I think it's a good message to send out because it's not such a big deal to lots of people. Not all of them have such drama surrounding it". Donna's first storyline that included this aspect of her character was a kiss between herself and fellow female character, Sunny Lee (Hany Lee). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips, as it is her first kiss. The show's producers called the kiss between Sunny and Donna as [...] "impulsive" [...] and Robbie agreed saying [...] "It's really not a big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's just kind of an impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|E
