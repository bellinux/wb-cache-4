As the population grows in the region, especially in the greater downtown Miami area, graded and textured crosswalks are added to slow traffic along busy streets such as Brickell Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard (US 1). New crosswalks installed in the Upper Eastside along Biscayne Boulevard in late 2011 will also be outlined with flashing lights, as well as having islands {{in the center of}} the road and large <b>speed</b> <b>feedback</b> signs to warn automotive traffic.

25|$|A {{servomotor}} is a motor, {{very often}} {{sold as a}} complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control valves, such as motor-operated control valves. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or <b>speed</b> <b>feedback</b> on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.|$|E

This report details the extension of those ideas to the Envisat altimeter, RA- 2, which operates at Ku-band and S-band.

This technique opens a broad reaching applications by providing direct and intu-itive interactions during micromanipulation.

The used force sensor is a novel event-based vision sensor that transmits output as a stream of asynchronous timestamped events that eliminates internally the redundant static information. The associated event based algorithm can thus be able to track the positions of two spheres up to 1 kHz.
