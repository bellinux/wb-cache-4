40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examine the effects of}} {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on the ability of the hyperaccumulator plant Alyssum lesbiacum to phytoextract nickel from co-contaminated soil. Planted and unplanted mesocosms containing the contaminated soils were repeatedly amended with <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate,</b> salicylic acid and histidine in various combinations to enhance the degradation of two PAHs (phenanthrene and chrysene) and increase nickel phytoextraction. Plant growth was negatively affected by PAHs; however, there was no significant effect on the phytoextraction of Ni per unit biomass of shoot. Exogenous histidine did not increase nickel phytoextraction, but the histidine-extractable fraction of soil nickel showed a high correlation with phytoextractable nickel. These results indicate that Alyssum lesbiacum might be effective in phytoextracting nickel from marginally PAH-contaminated soils. In addition, we provide evidence for the broader applicability of histidine for quantifying and predicting Ni phytoavailability in soils. Alyssum lesbiacum was shown to phytoextract nickel from PAH-contaminated soils from which the pool of nickel accessed for phytoextraction is closely modelled by a histidine-soil extract...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of mobile}} phase {{modifiers}} in supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and {{their effect on}} the separation process were investigated. A study {{of the influence of}} temperature and density on chromatographic behaviour in supercritical carbon dioxide and four modified carbon dioxide mobile phases demonstrates the importance of both density and mobile phase composition in controlling retention characteristics. The information gained from these studies was used to develop methodology for the separation and detection of a series of phenothiazinone compounds and an assay for L- 615, 919, 4 -chloro- 3 H-phenothiazin- 3 -one, in plasma. The development of an analytical method for the analysis of <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate</b> in pharmaceutical formulations demonstrates a unique application of SFC with flame ionization detection (FID) that is not possible by other chromatographic techniques. The feasibility of an electrochemical detection system for SFC has been demonstrated. The design and construction of an electrochemical detector with a platinum ultramicro working electrode and factors influencing its performance are described...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in lipid nanoparticles because of their suitability for several administration routes. Thus, it becomes even more relevant the physicochemical characterization of lipid materials {{with respect to their}} polymorphism, lipid miscibility and stability, as well as the assessment of the effect of surfactant on the type and structure of these nanoparticles. This work focuses on the physicochemical characterization of lipid matrices composed of pure stearic acid or of mixtures of stearic acid-capric/caprylic triglycerides, for drug delivery. The lipids were analyzed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD), Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM) and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) in combination with selected surfactants to determine the best solid-to-liquid ratio. Based on the results obtained by DSC and WAXD, the selected qualitative and quantitative composition contributed for the production of stable nanoparticles, since the melting and the tempering processes provided important information on the thermodynamic stability of solid lipid matrices. The best HLB value obtained for stearic acid-capric/caprylic triglycerides was 13. 8, achieved after combining these lipids with accepted surfactants (<b>trioleate</b> <b>sorbitan</b> and polysorbate 80 in the ratio of 10 : 90). The proposed combinations were shown useful to obtain a stable emulsion to be used as intermediate form for the production of lipid nanoparticles. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

However, delivery of vaccine by the oral route offers great potential in producing systemic and local immune responses at various mucosal surfaces {{not only in}} the GI-tract where infection begins but also in the lung, salivary glands, and genitourinary region. Preparation of alginate microparticles by an emulsification method was investigated. Formulation effects of the type and concentration of the surfactant and cation on the particle size and size distribution of the alginate microparticles was also investigated. The results obtained indicated that surfactant HLB, structure and concentration as well as the concentration of the cation and alginate {{played an important role in}} the formation of alginate microparticles within the 1 - 10 μm size range. Microparticles in the size range of 2 - 5 μm were obtained using high concentration of surfactant <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate</b> at a HLB of 1. 8, high concentration of zinc chloride, and a sodium alginate concentration of 1. 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{emulsion}} {{liquid membrane}} (ELM) technique {{is a process}} used for separation. It uses organic diluents, extractants, and surfactants. Due to the organic nature of these constituents, an unwanted organic matter release to the external phase occurs during the separation process. The present study demonstrates this organic matter release to the external phase in the ELM process used {{for the removal of}} lead ions from industrial storage battery wastewater. Toluene, kerosene, mineral oil, and xylene, as organic diluents, sorbitan monooleate (Span 80) and polyoxyethylene (20) <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate</b> (Tween 85), as surfactants, and di- 2 -ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA), as extractant, were used. In the process of lead ion removal from storage battery wastewater, while lead ion concentration decreased to < 0. 4 mg/l from its initial value of 2. 8 mg/l, the organic matter load (COD) of the treated wastewater increased to about 160 mg/l. Additionally, Span 80 exhibited better results than Tween 85 in terms of CODs and lead removal. Kerosene had a more stable membrane than the other organic diluents used.

ISBN 952 - 91 - 6585 - 4 (paperback) ISBN 952 - 10 - 1476 - 8 (PDF) The {{main purpose of}} the present study was to gain understanding about the rheological (elastic, viscoelastic and viscous) {{properties of}} pharmaceutical creams containing sorbitan fatty acid ester surfactants (sorbitan monolaurate, sorbitan monopalmitate, sorbitan monostearate, sorbitan monooleate and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate).</b> The study investigated the effects of an increase in the hydrocarbon chain length, the double bonded hydrocarbon chains and the concentration of the surfactant on the rheological properties of the sorbitan fatty acid ester surfactant containing creams. In addition, the effects of the volume of inner phase and the short-term storage on the rheological properties of the sorbitan fatty acid ester surfactant containing creams were investigated. The creams studied were either simple, three-component creams, or complex, multi-component creams. The rheological properties were determined with dynamic oscillation stress sweep and oscillation frequency sweep measurements, with static creep recovery measurements and with time-dependent viscosity measurements...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of the emulsifying conditions and emulsifier type on production of water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions encapsulating ascorbic acid derivatives by microchannel (MC) emulsification. The ascorbic acid derivatives added in a dispersed aqueous phase are calcium ascorbate (AA-Ca) and ascorbic acid 2 -glucoside (AA- 2 G). The continuous phase used was decane, soybean oil or their mixture, containing 5 % (w/w) tetraglycerin monolaurate condensed ricinoleic acid ester or <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate.</b> A hydrophobized silicon MC array plate (model: MS 407) with a channel depth of 7 μm was used for MC emulsification. The use of MC emulsification enabled successful encapsulation of AA-Ca and AA- 2 G in monodisperse W/O emulsion droplets with coefficients of variation (CV) less than 7 %. Their average droplet diameter (dav) increased with increasing the continuous-phase viscosity that is similar or higher than the dispersed-phase viscosity. The dav and CV of the resultant monodisperse W/O emulsions were unaffected by the dispersed-phase flow rate below critical values of 1. 2 - 1. 6 mLh- 1 when using decane as the continuous-phase medium...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{adjuvant}} MF 59 to enhance the immunogenicity of polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines was investigated in infant baboons. MF 59 consists of stable droplets (< 250 nm) of the metabolizable oil squalene and two surfactants, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate,</b> in an oil-in-water emulsion. In humans, MF 59 is well tolerated and enhances the immunogenicity of recombinant protein subunit or particle vaccines. Its effect on the immunogenicity of polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines is unknown. Baboons 1 to 4 months of age were immunized intramuscularly with Neisseria meningitidis group C and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) oligosaccharide-CRM 197 conjugate vaccines. The lyophilized vaccines were reconstituted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Al(OH) 3 (alum), or MF 59. Groups of five animals each were given three injections of the respective formulations, with one injection every 4 weeks. Four weeks after each immunization, the MF 59 group had up to 7 -fold-higher geometric mean anticapsular-antibody titers than the alum group and 5 - to 10 -fold-higher N. meningitidis group C bactericidal-antibody titers. Twenty-one weeks after the third immunization, the MF 59 group still showed 5 - to 10 -fold-higher anticapsular-antibody titers. The antibody responses of the animals given the vaccines reconstituted with PBS were low at all times measured. Both the MF 59 and alum groups, but not the PBS group, showed booster antibody responses to unconjugated Hib and N. meningitidis group C polysaccharides, results consistent with induction of memory B cells. Thus, MF 59 may be useful for accelerating and augmenting immunity to polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines in infants...|$|E
40|$|LaGaO_ 3 基固体电解质是目前固体氧化物燃料电池电解质领域研究的新热点。本工作对锶镁掺杂的镓酸镧（LSGM）电解质的制备方法、性能和在SOFC中的应用作了初步的研究。用相转移分离法制备了LSGM粉末，粉末的比表面积达到了 22. 4 m~ 2 /g。优化了相转移分离法的工艺路线，使用了非离子表面活性剂取代含Na离子的活性剂，解决了Na离子的影响问题。LSGM电解质的烧结密度为 6. 28 g/cm~ 3 ，是理论密度的 94 %。在测量温度范围内的氧离子迁移数接近于 1 。离子电导率和绝对温度乘积的对数和绝对温度的倒数近似为线性关系，符合经典的Arrhenius经验方程。以Ni为阳极、锰酸镧锶（LSM）为阴极，LSGM为电解质的SOFC实验电池的最大功率密度和最大电流密度分别为 68 mW/cm~ 2 和 126 mA/cm~ 2 。 EDS法分析了实验电池阳极－电解质－阴极断面的元素分布，发现电解质的主要成分之一的Ga从电解质层扩散到阴极层。另外还观察到在阳极－电解质界面上La和Ni的互扩散现象。这些现象可能是导致本实验电池功率密度和电流密度偏低的主要原因。LaGaO_ 3 -based {{electrolyte}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} promising electrolytes of SOFC. This study is concerned with the preparation, characteristics and the application of SrO and MgO doped LaGaO_ 3 (LSGM) in SOFC. A phase-transfer-separation route was used to prepare the ultra-fine powder of LSGM, the specific surface area of the powder was obtained at 22. 4 m~ 2 /g. And the preparing conditions of the process were optimized. A non-ion surfactant, <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate</b> (Span- 85), was selected to replace the commonly used dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid sodium salt. As the existence of Na in the salt would deteriorate sintering and electrochemical properties of the LSGM electrolyte. The sintered density of LSGM was measured at 6. 28 g/cm~ 3, which is 94 % of theoretical density, and the oxygen ion transference numbers were close to unity at all testing temperatures. Moreover, the relationship between the ion conductivity and absolute temperature obeyed the classical Arrhenius equation. The power density and maximum current density of the testing SOFC cell, which was constructed with Ni anode, La_(0. 8) Sr_(0. 2) MnO_ 3 (LSM) cathode and LSGM electrolyte, were 68 mW/cm~ 2 and 126 mA/cm~ 2 respectively. Energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) was used to detect the contents of different elements across the intersection of the Ni-LSGM-LSM. The diffusion of Ga from LSGM to LSM was detected, which effected the composition and ion conductivity of LSGM. Furthermore, the presence of Ga in LSM possibly deteriorated electro-catalytic properties of the cathode. The diffusion of La and Ni across the interface of LSGM and Ni was also detected. These reasons could explain the lower power density and current density of the present testing cell...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} several {{antifoaming}} agents by inhalation in preventing paroxysmal pulmonary edema was {{tested in a}} series of rabbits. Three single agents (silicone aerosol, freon, and ethyl alcohol vapor) proved beneficial; their combination did not enhance the beneficial effect. A new agent (silicone aerosol) and a new combination (10 per cent ether in alcohol by aerosol) are now ready for clinical triiil. A NTIFOAMING agents in paroxysmal / % pulmonary edema were advocated in J. A. 1950 by one of us (A. A. L.) following animal experimentation. 1 Several substances having effect on surface tension were tested in-cluding ether, octyl alcohol, capryl alcohol, <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate,</b> and ethyl alcohol. Pulmonary edema was induced in rabbits by intravenous injection of epinephrine while the various sub-stances were administered by inhalation by means of an atomizer. Further experiments were conducted in ex-perimental pulmonary edema of the rat caused by intraperitoneal injection of thiourea, in pul-monary edema of the guinea pig caused by ingestion of ammonium chloride, and in pulmo-nary edema of the dog caused by rapid intra-carotid infusion of physiologic salt solution. 2 The general conclusion was that the heavy alcohols failed to develop any favorable effect, that ether had a moderate beneficial action, and that ethyl alcohol exerted an important favorable effect. This effect was attributed to modification of the surface tension of the foam followed by decrease of its volume and better oxygenation of the lungs. As systemic effects of the inhaled alcohol vapor were minimal, the method was particularly indicated for patients with pulmonary edema in shock or for those who might develop this syndrome. In the mean-time, several antifoaming agents were com-pared in vitro by Rosenbluth and associates. 7 The same authors found that the inhalation o...|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} of impedance spectroscopy {{was used in}} a thin cell (10 μm) to infer conductivity, permittivity and the differential double-layer capacitance of solutions of dodecane doped with oil soluble commercial surfactants. Solutions of OLOA 11000 ® [poly(isobutylene succinimide) ] in dodecane were fit to an equivalent circuit model having four elements including a constant-phase element representing the double-layer capacitance. Using Gouy-Chapman theory for small zeta potentials and assuming univalent charge carriers, the double-layer capacitances were converted into charge carrier concentration. The impedance of dodecane doped with <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate</b> (Span 85 ®), sorbitan monooleate (Span 80 ®) and sorbitan monolaurate (Span 20 ®) was also measured in a thin cell. Nyquist plots of all three surfactants showed the high frequency semicircle characteristic of parallel resistance and capacitance but often exhibited a second semicircle at low frequencies which was attributed to charge adsorption and desorption. The adsorption rate constants were independent of surfactant concentration while the desorption rate constants were proportional to the surfactant concentration. The surfactants AOT®, OLOA 11000 ®, Span 85 ®, Span 80 ®, and Span 20 ® all increased the conductivity of dodecane. Phase analysis light scattering was used to find the hydrodynamic diameter of the micelles formed by the surfactants. For each surfactant the measured conductivity increased linearly with concentration above the critical micelle concentration (CMC). The molar conductivity of the different surfactants increased exponentially with the estimated diameter of the polar core of the surfactants. An apparatus and a method for determining the zeta potential of planar solids in contact with nonpolar liquids are described {{and values of the}} zeta potential are provided. The motor rotated the disk-shaped sample at several thousand rpm. A glassy carbon electrode with a circular exposed end was near the sample at its axis and a second glassy carbon electrode was far from the sample. Rotating the sample generated streaming potential as measured by an electrometer. The zeta potential of ITO coated glass was shown to have a magnitude smaller than 25 mV in solutions of OLOA 11000 ® in dodecane. The measured zeta potential of ITO justifies the assumption of small zeta potentials made in the theory used to fit the impedance data...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} enhance the textural {{properties}} of the synthetic hectorite clay Laponite RD. In the early 1990 s Mobil Research and Development Corporation produced the first ordered mesoporous molecular sieves. This family of materials, M 41 S, were fabricated via liquid crystal templating (LCT), a technique involving the condensation and hydrolysis of a silica source around an organic template. As clays are primarily silicates, the question arises "Why not apply the same principles to enhance porosity characteristics of other silicates such as clays?" Optimization of reagent concentrations, template choice, synthesis protocol and template removal strategy led to a maximum total pore volume of 0. 95 cm 3 g- 1. This was achieved through templating Laponite RD with the neutral surfactant polyoxyethylene (20) <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate</b> (Tween 85). This more than trebled the original total pore volume of Laponite RD, 0. 27 cm 3 g- 1. An increase in modal pore diameter was also observed after use of this template; from 36. 6 A to 52. 3 A. Synthesis of Laponite-like compounds within the laboratory led to enhancement of porosity characteristics without templating; a total pore volume of 0. 44 cm 3 g- 1 was observed for this synthetic hectorite (KP). Use of a template further enhanced the porosity characteristics of these samples. The cationic surfactant CTMA+ (used in the original Mobil synthesis) led to a total pore volume of 0. 60 cm 3 g- 1 for modified hectorite KP. A similar result, 0. 65 cm 3 g- 1, was achieved through templating Laponite RD with this same surfactant. Sorption and exchange properties of the newly modified hectorites were assessed by simple equilibrium batch testing methods using both single metal and multi-metal solutions. Hectorite KP samples removed {{a greater percentage of}} metal ions from aqueous solution than its Laponite RD analogues. For 5 mg dm- 3 single element solutions CTMA+ modified hectorite removed > 95 % of all eight metals tested. For solutions containing higher concentrations of ions the removal efficiency of all tested clays were reduced due to greater competition between ions. Partial interlayer collapse was observed during powder XRD studies, due to the acidic nature of the metal ion solutions...|$|E
