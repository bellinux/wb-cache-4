60|$|She said this, but {{in their}} own rooms it was so {{soothing}} to sit looking through the long twilight at the lovely landscape that the sort of bruise given by their encounter with the Stollers had left her consciousness before March returned. She made him admire first the convent church on a hill further up the river which exactly balanced the fortress in front of them, and then she seized upon the little books he had brought, and set him to exploring the labyrinths of their German, with a mounting exultation in his discoveries. There was a general guide to the city, and a <b>special</b> <b>guide,</b> with plans and personal details of the approaching manoeuvres and the princes who were to figure in them; {{and there was a}} sketch of the local history: a kind of thing that the Germans know how to write particularly, well, with little gleams of pleasant humor blinking through it. For the study of this, Mrs. March realized, more and more passionately, that they were in the very most central and convenient point, for the history of Wurzburg might be said to have begun with her prince-bishops, whose rule had begun in the twelfth century, and who had built, on a forgotten Roman work, the fortress of the Marienburg on that vineyarded hill over against the Swan Inn. There had of course been history before that, but 'nothing so clear, nothing so peculiarly swell, nothing that so united the glory of this world and the next as that of the prince-bishops. They had made the Marienburg their home, and kept it against foreign and domestic foes for five hundred years. Shut within its well-armed walls they had awed the often-turbulent city across the Main; they had held it against the embattled farmers in the Peasants' War, and had splendidly lost it to Gustavus Adolphus, and then got it back again and held it till Napoleon took it from them. He gave it with their flock to the Bavarians, who in turn briefly yielded it to the Prussians in 1866, and were now in apparently final possession of it.|$|E

50|$|A {{stripper}} clip or charger is a speed-loader {{that holds}} several cartridges {{together in a}} single unit for easier loading of a firearm's magazine. A stripper clip is used only for loading the magazine and is not necessary for the firearm to function. It is called a 'stripper' clip because, after the bolt is opened and the stripper clip is placed in position (generally by placing it in a slot on either the receiver or bolt), the cartridges are pressed down, thereby 'stripping' them off the stripper clip and into the magazine. The clip is then either removed and tossed away, or the bolt is thrown forward, expending the clip without the need of prior removal. A few examples of designs that allow for stripper clip use include the Mauser C96, Lee-Enfield, Mosin-Nagant, SKS and the Vz. 58. Detachable magazines may also be loaded with stripper clips, provided they have a <b>special</b> <b>guide</b> attached, such as an M14 or an M16.|$|E

We set up a theoretical framework in which we prove under some sufficient conditions that the adjusted system (with the added guide process) exhibits {{a subset of the}} behaviour of the original system, and has no new deadlocks. We have applied this technique to a Promela specification of the IEEE 1394. 1 FireWire net update algorithm. The experiment shows that this technique increases the error detecting power of Spin {{in the sense that we}} found errors in the guided specification, which could not be discovered with Spin simulation and validation in the original specification...|$|E
40|$|An {{automated}} {{tracking system}} {{was developed to}} measure the flexion-extension motion of lumbar vertebrae using the algorithm of Sequential Important Resampling Particle Filter. In vitro validity was performed in 10 samples under digitized video fluoroscopy. Each sample was taken 2 full flexion-extension cycles under a <b>special</b> <b>guide</b> device in fixed speed, while the calibration model of lumbar vertebrae was fixed on a metal base. The trajectories are recorded by real-time depiction of the vertebral body with rigid fixation pens when the digitized video fluoroscopy collection is finished. A special system that can perform automatic tracking on the motion of lumbar vertebrae was developed. Reliability of the measurement was evaluated by a saw bone model experiment. In comparing with real-time motion recording, the correlation coefficient of test-retest and the accuracy were calculated, which showed satisfactory stability and consistency. The results suggested this new developed automatic tracking system could be a reliable tool to monitor the dynamic lumbar motion; to analyze the translation and rotational angle of vertebral from video-fluoroscopic images automatically and accurately.

We drilled five sites during Expedition 331 using <b>special</b> <b>guide</b> bases at three holes for reentry, casing, and capping, including installation of a steel mesh platform with valve controls for postcruise sampling of fluids. At Site C 0016, drilling {{at the base of}} the North Big Chimney (NBC) mound yielded low recovery, but core included the first Kuroko-type black ore ever recovered from the modern subseafloor. The other four sites yielded interbedded hemipelagic and strongly pumiceous volcaniclastic sediment, along with volcanogenic breccias that are variably hydrothermally altered and mineralized. At most sites, analyses of interstitial water and headspace gas yielded complex patterns with depth and lateral distance of only a few meters. Documented processes included formation of brines and vapor-rich fluids by phase separation and segregation, uptake of Mg and Na by alteration minerals in exchange for Ca, leaching of K at high temperature and uptake at low temperature, anhydrite precipitation, potential microbial oxidation of organic matter and anaerobic oxidation of methane utilizing sulfate, and methanogenesis. Shipboard analyses have found evidence for microbial activity in sediments within the upper 10 – 30 m below seafloor (mbsf) where temperatures were relatively low, but little evidence in the deeper hydrothermally altered zones and hydrothermal fluid regime. doi: 10. 2204 /iodp. sd. 13. 03. 2011 </a...|$|E
40|$|Brownfield {{redevelopment}} is {{a relatively}} new idea of redevelopment in our country. The main factor Brownfield development is a priority for Brownfield development is {{a solution to the problem}} of shortage of land in the city center. Brownfield redevelopment will also create many job opportunities to the unemployed. The main factor Brownfield redevelopment should be encouraged because of the development will reduce the explore of the new forest because there are still Brownfield sites can be developed. There are three key actor in the development of Brownfield sites, they consist of property developers, Local Authorities and the purchaser. Brownfield redevelopment more popular now is because there is high demand for land in major cities such as Kuala Lumpur. The developer is not interested in developing Brownfield sites because they often faced with the problem of uncertainty in the implementation of the redevelopment of this area. In this research, there was a special government agency should be established to manage the development of potential Brownfield. Another important point in the research of the redevelopment of Brownfield sites are <b>special</b> <b>guide</b> lines should be established for the reference of all parties involved. To achieve the objectives of this study, researchers used data on primary and secondary data to make a referral-based, primary obtained through interviews with those involved in the development and use of a questionnaire to those who are directly involved in the development of Brownfield sites. The researcher found that the redevelopment of Brownfield sites have many advantages which should be promoted. The proposed research is a comprehensive guideline for the management of all party involved should be established. If there is a government agency that can assist in this development and there are comprehensive guidelines, the interests of developers and government departments to develop Brownfield sites will increase. Brownfield areas are areas that need to be developed for these the benefits to all segments of society...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this research are intended to describe (1) teacher 2 ̆ 7 s strategy in teaching learning activity for slow learner in the inclusive class of SMPN 7 Klaten, (2) the teaching learning process in the inclusive class of SMPN 7 Klaten, (3) teacher 2 ̆ 7 s problems in Mathematics teaching learning process in the inclusive class of SMPN 7 Klaten. This research used a qualitative approach {{in the form of}} field research. The subjects of the research are four participants choosen by using purposive sampling. They are a mathematics teacher, a slow learner having special needs and two normal students. The research instruments consist of the researcher as the main instrument, observation sheet as the first supplementary instrumen and interview basic as the second supplementary instrumen. Based on the results of the research, it can be concluded that, as follows: (1) teacher conducted the planning step by designing lesson plan, the teaching learning step and the evaluation/follow up step in the inclusive class as same as what the teacher conducted in the regular class. The difference is situated only at the giving of special attention and the special guidance for slow learner who have special need during teaching learning process in the class, (2) the slow learner having special needs tend to participate passively in the matematics teaching learning process, they prefer to write the materials given by teacher rather than pay more attention, they prefer to like a calm class situation as same as the normal students 2 ̆ 7 class, and they have more learning time than normal students about three hours a day and they are helped by their mother when they got and finished their duties or homework, (3) teacher 2 ̆ 7 s problems in mathematics teaching learning process in inclusive class is caused by two factors that are internal factor and external factor. Internal factors refers to the lack of the mathematics teacher 2 ̆ 7 s understanding about the inclusive education and having less capability to teach the slow learner who have special need. External factors deals with there are no the <b>special</b> <b>guide</b> teachers and there are no special facilities which being prepared in mathematics teaching learning process for slow learner who have special needs...|$|E
