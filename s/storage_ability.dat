50|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2013 found that, while INSIG1 and SREBF1 mRNA expression was decreased in the adipose tissue of obese mice and humans, {{the amount of}} active SREBF1 was increased in comparison with normal mice and non-obese patients. This downregulation of INSIG1 expression combined {{with the increase of}} mature SREBF1 was also correlated with the maintenance of SREBF1-target gene expression. Hence, it appears that, by downregulating INSIG1, there is a resetting of the INSIG1/SREBF1 loop, allowing for the maintenance of active SREBF1 levels.

It was objective of this work to study the effect of calcium preharvest application in two different forms and calcium chloride application postharvest on 'Hayward' kiwifruit <b>storage</b> <b>ability.</b> Kiwifruit vines were sprayed with 0. 03 % CaCl 2 or 0. 03 % CaO at one, three and four months before harvest.

During storage, fruits dipped in 1 % CaCl 2 softened slower and than fruits not treated. Weight loss was higher in fruits treated with CaO preharvest. SSC showed a significant decrease in fruits sprayed with CaO from 4 to 6 months storage. This work suggests that immersion of kiwifruit in 1 % CaCl 2 postharvest benefits storage life capacity; preharvest spraying with CaCl 2 seems to be better than with CaO.

Reflective Extenday® mulch was also applied on the tree row for almost a month before anticipated harvest at control or deficit irrigated trees. Fruit quality from the upper and lower parts of the tree was evaluated at harvest and after 2, 4 and 6 weeks at 2 °C plus 1 day shelf life. Fruit quality included skin color, flesh firmness, specific conductivity and dry matter (DM), juice soluble solids content (SSC), acidity and total phenols (TP) and subjective evaluation of chilling injury (CI) symptoms (flesh leatheriness and browning). With storage time and in both cultivars, fruit skin only slightly changed, fruit flesh softened, specific conductivity, SSC, acidity and DM decreased and TP content and CI (mainly leatheriness) increased. With deficit irrigation or reflective mulch, the two cultivars behaved differently. Nectarines from deficit irrigated trees had improved quality but lower <b>storage</b> <b>ability</b> than fruit from control trees. Peaches from deficit irrigated trees had similar quality to control fruit except of higher SSC (mainly the fruit from {{the lower part of the}} canopy) and slightly higher CI.

5000|$|In 2013 the Dutch {{technology}} developer TNO {{presented the}} results of the MERITS project to store heat in a salt container.

In a temperate climate like that of the Netherlands, an average low-energy household requires about 6.7 GJ/winter.
