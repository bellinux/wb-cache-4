5|$|According to a {{study from}} 2003–2004, there were 13 {{different}} species of fish in the Potlatch River watershed, including speckled dace, longnose dace, rainbow trout (both wild and farm-raised), brook trout, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, northern pikeminnow, redside shiner, sculpin, bridgelip sucker, largescale sucker, and yellow perch. Migration of steelhead, the anadromous phase of rainbow trout, has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual fish population in the watershed, while steelhead accounted for 58.4% of the biomass. Of all the streams sampled during the study, the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition. The lower section of the river suffers from chronic pollution caused by agricultural runoff. From 2005 to 2008, the population of steelhead (rainbow) trout in the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead Monitoring and Evaluation Program (PRSME). There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river, while an average of 226 was recorded annually {{in one of the}} river's larger tributaries, Big Bear Creek. Over 1,000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years. Outmigration of steelhead <b>smolt</b> from the East Fork was estimated at 6,976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9,491. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch.|$|E
25|$|As they {{approach}} {{the time when they}} are ready to migrate out to the sea the parr lose their camouflage bars and undergo a process of physiological changes which allows them to survive the shift from freshwater to saltwater. At this point salmon are called <b>smolt.</b> <b>Smolt</b> spend time in the brackish waters of the river estuary while their body chemistry adjusts their osmoregulation to cope with the higher salt levels they will encounter in the ocean. <b>Smolt</b> also grow the silvery scales which visually confuse ocean predators. When they have matured sufficiently in late spring, and are about 15 to 20 centimetres long, the <b>smolt</b> swim out of the rivers and into the sea. There they spend their first year as a post-smolt. Post-smolt form schools with other post-smolt, and set off to find deep-sea feeding grounds. They then spend up to four more years as adult ocean salmon while their full swimming ability and reproductive capacity develop.|$|E
25|$|By {{creating}} additional channel network complexity, including {{ponds and}} marshes laterally {{separated from the}} main channel, beavers {{may play a role}} in the creation and maintenance of fish biodiversity. In off-mainstem channels restored by beaver on the middle section of Utah's Provo River, native fish species persist even when they have been extirpated in the mainstem channel by competition from introduced non-native fish. Efforts to restore salmonid habitat in the western United States have focused primarily on establishing large woody debris in streams to slow flows and create pools for young salmonids. Research in Washington found that the average summer <b>smolt</b> production per beaver dam ranges from 527 to 1,174 fish, whereas the summer <b>smolt</b> production from a pool formed by instream large woody debris is about 6–15 individuals, suggesting that re-establishment of beaver populations would be 80 times more effective.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Gill Na+-K+ ATPase {{activity}} and body silvering were studied in spring in one- and two year old sea trout (Salmo trutta m. trutta L.), under hatchery conditions.

40|$|A {{large number}} of rivers in {{northern}} Sweden have hydropower developments that cause negative effects on both up- and downstream migrations of anadromous species like Atlantic salmon. So far, most attention {{has focused on the}} hindrances of adult fish during their upstream spawning migration. However, since turbines in power stations cause losses on downstream passing fish, the focus on negative effects on <b>smolts</b> has increased. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare three different causes of losses of salmon <b>smolts</b> passing downstream through a power station area in the flow-controlled River Åbyälven in northern Sweden. A total of 61 wild salmon <b>smolts</b> were caught and radio-tagged in the River Åbyälven during their downstream migration in June 2009. The salmon <b>smolts</b> were released at three locations, 1. 1 km upstream from the power station, in the turbine intake and in the upper part of a fishway, acting both for up- and downstream fish passage. In this study, 59 % of the radio-tagged <b>smolts</b> released upstream from the power station remained stationary close to their release location during the entire study period. It is believed that most of these <b>smolts</b> became victims of predation. About 35 % of the radio tagged <b>smolts</b> that descended downstream via the turbine were judged as dead after passage, whereas the losses of <b>smolts</b> passing downstream through the fishway was 33 % (explained by lethal injuries). The overall mortality of <b>smolts</b> passing the power station reservoir, the turbine and the fishway in the river was estimated to be about 94 %. Taking these results into account, the dammed up area with its predators, seems to be what poses the greatest threat to the <b>smolts</b> during their downstream migration. The mortality during passage through the fishway and the mortality during passage through the turbine showed little difference. It seems that it is almost as dangerous for the <b>smolts</b> to take the route through the fishway as to take the route through the turbine...|$|R
40|$|Downstream fish passage {{facilities}} at the Holyoke Project were modified {{to enhance the}} passage of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) <b>smolts.</b> A pier extension was installed adjacent to the Holyoke Dam bascule gate, the opening of an experimental weir inserted in the bascule gate was {{moved closer to the}} Hadley Falls Station intakes, and above-water lighting was added. An intake rack overlay was in place at both Hadley Falls Station units {{during the first half of}} this evaluation; the Unit 2 overlay was removed during the second half. Radiotagged, hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon <b>smolts</b> were released upstream of the Project and downstream passage routes were monitored. All releases were conducted after flashboards had been installed on the crest of the dam, closing that passage route. Overall, 63 % of the radiotagged <b>smolts</b> that approached Hadley Falls Station passed over the bascule gate weir and 37 % passed through the turbines. These results were comparable to results obtained in a 1992 evaluation, when a floating guide wall was present upstream of the intakes. Two-thirds of the radiotagged <b>smolts</b> that passed through the turbines at Hadley Falls Station did so through Unit 1. Removal of the Unit 2 intake rack overlay did not affect the proportion of radiotagged <b>smolts</b> passing through the turbines. Combining data from 1992 and 1995, a statistically significant but weak negative relationship between flow through the station and the proportion of radiotagged <b>smolts</b> passing over the bascule gate/weir was found. The louver/bypass system in the Holyoky Canal passed 91 % of the radiotagged <b>smolts</b> entering the canal back to the Hadley Falls Station tailrace. Above-water lighting installed upstream of the canal gatehouse appeared to have raised the proportion of radiotagged <b>smolts</b> entering the canal. When the results of passage through the bascule gate weir and the louver/bypass system were combined, 74 % of the radiotagged <b>smolts</b> passed through downstream passage facilities. <b>Smolts</b> passing through the louver/bypass system or through the turbines arrived at a location downstream of the dam more quickly than <b>smolts</b> that had passed through the bascule gate weir...|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} that sea lice survive on fish that remain in the estuaries or that they transfer to an as yet unknown alternate host to spend the winter. <b>Smolt</b> get infected with sea lice larvae, or even possibly adults, when they enter the estuaries in the spring. It is also not known how sea lice distribute between fish in the wild. Adult stages of Lepeophtheirus spp. can transfer under laboratory conditions, but the frequency is low. Caligus spp. transfer quite readily and between different species of fish, and are regularly found in the plankton.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{eggs are}} laid in {{freshwater}} streams typically at high latitudes. The eggs hatch into alevin or sac fry. The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes. The parr stay {{for six months}} {{to three years in}} their natal stream before becoming smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with scales that are easily rubbed off. Only 10% of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage. The <b>smolt</b> body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water. Smolts spend a portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry becomes accustomed to osmoregulation in the ocean.|$|E
25|$|Farming {{in the sea}} (mariculture) for {{king salmon}} is {{sometimes}} called sea-cage ranching. Sea-cage ranching takes place in large floating net cages, about 25 metres across and 15 metres deep, moored to the sea floor in clean, fast-flowing coastal waters. <b>Smolt</b> (young fish) from freshwater hatcheries are transferred to cages containing several thousand salmon, and remain there {{for the rest of}} their life. They are fed fishmeal pellets high in protein and oil. Most of this fishmeal is imported from Australia. The salmon are harvested when they are about two years old, weighing 2.5 to 4 kilograms.

25|$|Beaver ponds {{have been}} shown to have a {{beneficial}} effect on trout and salmon populations. Many authors believe that the decline of salmonid fishes is related to the decline in beaver populations. Research in the Stillaguamish River basin in Washington found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) <b>smolt</b> summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity. This study also found that beaver ponds increased <b>smolt</b> salmon production 80 times more than the placement of large woody debris. Swales and Leving had previously shown on the Coldwater River in British Columbia that off-channel beaver ponds were preferentially populated by coho salmon over other salmonids and provided overwintering protection, protection from high summer snowmelt flows and summer coho rearing habitat. The presence of beaver dams has also been shown to increase either the number of fish, their size, or both, in a study of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Sagehen Creek, which flows into the Little Truckee River at an altitude of 5,800 feet in the northern Sierra Nevada. These findings are consistent with a study of small streams in Sweden, that found that brown trout were larger in beaver ponds compared with those in riffle sections, and that beaver ponds provide habitat for larger trout in small streams during periods of drought. Similarly, brook trout, coho salmon, and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were significantly larger in beaver ponds than those in unimpounded stream sections in Colorado and Alaska. In a recent study on a headwater Appalachian stream, brook trout were also larger in beaver ponds.|$|E
25|$|Introduction of {{predatory fish}} {{species such as}} {{bluegill}} and various types of bass that prey on salmon <b>smolt</b> are also {{a major contributor to}} the decline. The San Joaquin's point of divergence with the distributary Old River has historically created a sort of bottleneck for out migrating salmon because the Old River in turn branches into many side-channels and sloughs of the delta as well as various canal intakes. Recent years have seen work by the California Department of Water Resources and the California Department of Fish and Game to construct and manage temporary rock barriers {{at the head of the}} Old River in order to keep fish in the main channel of the San Joaquin River. In the fall of 2009, just 2,236 salmon returned to the entire river system to spawn; this has led to a government ban on salmon fishing off the coasts of northern California and Oregon. Recent years have seen efforts to bring back some of the salmon population to the San Joaquin and some of its tributaries; these include the establishment of fish hatcheries. , plans had been finalized for a $14.5 million hatchery near Friant Dam as part of a $20 million federal restoration project for the fish.|$|E
500|$|Oroville Dam {{completely}} {{blocks the}} anadromous migrations of Chinook salmon and steelhead trout in the Feather River. In 1967, {{in an effort}} to compensate for lost habitat, [...] the DWR and the California Department of Fish and Game completed the Feather River Fish Hatchery. The Fish Barrier Dam, built in 1962, intercepts salmon and trout before they reach the base of the impassable Thermalito Diversion Dam and forces them to swim up a fish ladder to the hatchery, which is located on the north bank of the Feather River. The hatchery produces 10 million salmon <b>smolt,</b> along with 450,000 trout <b>smolt,</b> to stock in the river each year.

500|$|Not {{only on the}} San Joaquin River have CVP {{facilities}} wreaked environmental havoc. On the Sacramento River, Red Bluff Diversion Dam in Tehama County, {{while not}} as large or as impacting as Friant Dam, was once a barrier to the migration of anadromous fish. The original fish passage facilities of the dam continually experienced problems {{from the beginning of}} operation in 1966, and introduced species that prey on young <b>smolt</b> often gather {{at the base of the}} dam, which reduced the population of outmigrating juvenile salmon into the Pacific. The Red Bluff Diversion Dam has since been replaced with a fish screen and pumping plant, thus allowing unimpaired passage through Red Bluff. Further upstream, Keswick and Shasta Dams form total barriers to fish migration. Even out of the Central Valley watershed, the CVP's diversion of water from the Trinity River from Lewiston Dam into Whiskeytown Lake has significantly hurt the Klamath River tributary's salmon run. Over three-quarters of the river's flow is diverted through the Clear Creek Tunnel and away from the Trinity River, causing the river below the dam to become warm, silty, shallow and slow-flowing, attributes that hurt young salmon.

To determine if Atlantic salmon <b>smolts</b> are more sensitive than parr to short-term acid/Al, parr and <b>smolts</b> held in the same experimental tanks were exposed to control (pH 6. 3 – 6. 6, 11 – 37 �gl − 1 Ali) and acid/Al (pH 5. 0 – 5. 4, 43 – 68 �gl − 1 Ali) conditions in the lab, and impacts on ion regulation, stress response and gill Al accumulation were examined after 2 and 6 days. Parr and <b>smolts</b> were also held in cages for 2 and 6 days in a reference (Rock River, RR) and an acid/Al-impacted tributary (Ball Mountain Brook, BMB) of the West River in Southern Vermont. In the lab, losses in plasma Cl − levels occurred in both control parr and <b>smolts</b> as compared to fish sampled {{prior to the start of}} the study, however <b>smolts</b> exposed to acid/Al experienced additional losses in plasma Cl − levels (9 – 14 mM) after 2 and 6 days, and increases in plasma cortisol (4. 3 -fold) and glucose (2. 9 -fold) levels after 6 days, whereas these parameters were not significantly affected by acid/Al in parr. Gill Na +,K +-ATPase (NKA) activity was not affected by acid/Al in either life-stage. Both parr and <b>smolts</b> held at BMB (but not RR) exhibited declines in plasma Cl −, and increases in plasma cortisol and glucose levels; these differences were significantly greater in <b>smolts</b> after 2 days but similar in parr and <b>smolts</b> after 6 days. Gill NKA activity was reduced 45 – 54 % in both life-stages held at BMB for 6 days compared to reference fish at RR. In both studies, exposure to acid/Al resulted in gill A...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} indicates that on an annual basis, <b>smolts</b> of stream-type Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha collected at Snake River dams and transported by barge to below Bonneville Dam have greater post-hydropower system mortality than <b>smolts</b> that migrate in-river. To date, this difference has most commonly been attributed to stress from collection and transportation, leading to decreased disease resistance or predator avoidance ability. Using both hatchery and wild passive integrated transponder (PIT) tagged Chinook salmon, we explored two mechanisms that either separately or jointly contributed to an alternative explanation: Altered timing of ocean entry and lost growth opportunity leading to size-selective predation. Based on weekly estimates of in-river survival and adult return rates of <b>smolts</b> that were transported or that migrated in-river between Lower Granite and Bonneville dams, we found greater post-hydropower system mortality for <b>smolts</b> transported {{early in the season}} but greater mortality for in-river migrating <b>smolts</b> later in the season. Migrants took 2 – 4 weeks to travel between the two dams, while transported fish took less than 2 d. Thus, fish leaving Lower Granite Dam under the two transit modes encountered different conditions downstream from Bonneville Dam. Further, wild and hatchery migrants grew 6 – 8 and 5 – 6 mm, respectively, while transported fish had no apparent growth in the less than 2 -d barge ride. Using length data and regression equations of size selectivity, we found that transported <b>smolts</b> were more vulnerable to predation by northern pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis (freshwater) and Pacific hake Merluccius productus (marine) than were migrants; this was particularly true for the smaller wild <b>smolts</b> transported early in the season. We concluded that the most parsimonious explanation for differential post-hydropower system mortality of transported Chinook salmon <b>smolts</b> related not to effects of stress but to differential size and timing of ocean entry...|$|R
