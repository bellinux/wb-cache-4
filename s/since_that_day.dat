25|$|In the Mahabharata epic story, Astika, the Brahmin son of Jaratkarus, {{who stopped}} the Sarpa Satra of Janamejaya, {{ruler of the}} Kuru empire which lasted for 12 years is well documented. This yagna was {{performed}} by Janamejaya to decimate the race of all snakes, to avenge {{for the death of}} his father Parikshita due to snake bite of Takshaka, the king of snakes. The day that the yagna (fire sacrifice) was stopped, due to the intervention of the Astika, was on the Shukla Paksha Panchami day in the month of Shravan when Takshaka, the king of snakes and his remaining race at that time were saved from decimation by the Sarpa Satra yagna. <b>Since</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> the festival is observed as Naga Panchami.|$|E
25|$|In {{this part}} of the country, snake is named Bhujang, which is also the Sanskrit name for snake, in the Kutch region. The name is {{attributed}} to the city of Bhuj which is located below the hill named Bhujiya, after Bhujang, as it was the abode of snakes. On top of this hill there is a fort known as the Bhujia Fort where a temple has been built for the snake god and a second temple is {{at the foot of the}} hill known as Nani Devi. Bhujia Fort was the scene of a major battle between Deshalji I, the ruler of Kutch and Sher Buland Khan, Mughal Viceroy of Gujarat who had invaded Kutch. It was the early period of Deshalji's reign. When the army of Kutch was in a state of losing the battle, a group of Naga Bawas opened the gate of Bhujia Fort by a clever ploy of visiting Nag temple for worship and joined the fray against Sher Buland Khan's army. Eventually Deshalji I won the battle. <b>Since</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> Naga Bawa and their leader have a pride of place in the procession held on Nag Panchami day. Within the fort, at one corner, there is a small square tower dedicated to Bhujang Nag (snake god), who in folklore is said to have been the brother of Sheshnag. It is said Bhujang Nag came from Than of Kathiawar and freed Kutch from the oppression of demons known as daityas and rakshasas. The Snake Temple was also built at the time of the fortification of the hill during Deshalji I's reign and provided with a chhatri. Every year on Nag Panchami day a fair is held at the temple premises. In the Sindhi community Nag Panchami is celebrated in honour of Gogro.|$|E
