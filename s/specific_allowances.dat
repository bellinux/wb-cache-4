One central element in many new telecommunications tariffs is the implementation of data caps, which are a common tool to address several challenges telecommunications providers face in today’s markets. In this context the recent introduction of so-called “managed services”, or “all-you-can-app ” offers draws the attention of regulators. The term “managed service ” is coined by operators to describe online-services that have a special agreement with the network operator. These service providers agree to revenue-sharing agreements and in turn their customers are alleviated from counting the data traffic they cause against their monthly quota.

40|$|Challenges in {{construction}} related to dimensional variability exist because producing components and assemblies that have perfect compliance to dimensions and geometry specified in a design {{is simply not}} feasible. The construction industry has traditionally adopted tolerances {{as a way of}} mitigating these challenges. But what happens when tolerances are not appropriate for managing dimensional variability? In applications requiring very precise dimensional coordination, such as in modular construction, the use of conventional tolerances is frequently insufficient for managing the impacts of dimensional variability. This is evident from the literature and numerous industry examples. Often, {{there is a lack of}} properly understanding the rationale behind tolerances and about how to derive case <b>specific</b> <b>allowances.</b> Literature surrounding the use of tolerances {{in construction}} indicates that dimensional variability is often approached in a trial and error manner, waiting for conflicts and challenges to first arise, before developing appropriate solutions. While this is time consuming, non-risk averse, prone to extensive rework and very costly in conventional construction, these issues only intensify in modular construction due to the accumulation of dimensional variability, the geometric complexity of modules, and discrepancy between module production precision and project site dimensional precision. This all points to a need for a systematic and strategic approach for managing dimensional variability in modular construction. This thesis explores dimensional variability management from a holistic construction life cycle viewpoint, examining key project stages (manufacture, fabrication, aggregation, handling, transportation and erection) to identify critical variability sources and proposing adequate strategies to control dimensional variability. The scope of this work relates primarily to the structural system of commercial building modules, based on the assumption that the sequence of production and dimensional variability of building subsystems (mechanical, electrical, plumbing, architectural) hinge upon the dimensional variability of the structure. A novel method for quantifying dimensional variability is developed, which uses 3 D imaging by way of laser scanning and building information models to compute deviations between the intent of a geometric design and the actual as-built construction. Novel strategies for managing dimensional variability are also developed, and include adaptation of manufacturing-based principles and practices for use in construction systems. The inspiration and foundation of these new strategies is derived from the original research of Dr. Colin Milberg, who explored how to apply tolerance theory used in manufacturing into civil construction systems. The new techniques developed in this thesis, along with other previous research, demonstrate that there is a clear correlation between manufacturing industries such as aerospace and automotive assembly production, and that of modular construction assembly production. In light of this, there is an opportunity to improve modular construction processes if these manufacturing-based methods can be appropriately implemented. This is the basis for the proposed methodology presented in this thesis. Application of the proposed methodology using case study examples demonstrates that dimensional variability in modular construction should be approached from a holistic viewpoint. Furthermore, it needs to incorporate much more consideration into the key factors and critical sources of variability rather than pursuing the traditional construction approach of developing inefficient trial and error solutions...|$|E

40|$|This paper compares {{two methods}} of {{assessing}} variability in simulation output. The methods make <b>specific</b> <b>allowance</b> for two sources of variation: that caused by uncertainty in estimating unknown input parameters (parameter uncertainty), and that {{caused by the}} inclusion of random variation within the simulation model itself (simulation uncertainty). The first method is based on classical statistical differential analysis; we show explicitly that, under general conditions, the two sources contribute separately to the total variation. In the classical approach, certain sensitivity coefficients have to be estimated. The effort needed to do this becomes progressively more expensive, increasing linearly {{with the number of}} unknown parameters. Moreover there is an additional difficulty of detecting spurious variation when the number of parameters is large. It is shown that a parametric form of bootstrap sampling provides an alternative method which does not suffer from either problem. For illustration, simulation of the operation of a small (4 -node) computer communication network is used to compare the accuracy of estimates using the two methods. A larger, more realistic, (30 -node) network is presented showing how the bootstrap method becomes competitive when the number of unknown parameters is large...|$|R

We take advantage of a unique workload management database to match Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) applicants to disability examiners, and use natural variation in examiners’ allowance rates to estimate the labor supply effects of SSDI. Because applicants are randomly assigned to examiners (conditional on observable characteristics), examiner <b>specific</b> <b>allowance</b> rates can be used to instrument for the allowance decision in a labor supply equation contrasting denied vs. allowed applicants. We find that the labor force participation rate of the marginal entrant would be on average 21 percentage points greater in the absence of SSDI benefit receipt. His or her likelihood of engaging in substantial gainful activity as defined by the SSDI program would be on average 13 percentage points higher, and he or she would earn $ 1, 600 to $ 2, 600 more per year on average in the absence of SSDI benefit receipt. The marginal entrant is likely to have a mental impairment, be young, and have low pre-onset earnings.

30|$|Some key {{carbon pricing}} {{policies}} {{in the world are}} summarized as follows. In 2003 in the U.S., carbon emission allowances could be traded among American corporations under a voluntary scheme on Chicago Climate Exchange. In October 2003, the EU parliament approved a new emission trading scheme in order to meet its commitment made in the Kyoto Protocol. Following this, an EU emission trading scheme (ETS), which was the largest multinational, greenhouse gas emission trading scheme in the world, was enforced in February 2005. Under the EU ETS, a <b>specific</b> <b>allowance</b> for emission was allocated to each EU member and any excessive allowance could be sold to whom was in need of allowances. Some allowances were permitted to be transferred between countries through joint implementation (JI) or clean development mechanisms (CDM), but these transfers should be validated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This type of EU ETS is also called cap-and-trade. In April 2007, an emission price of $ 15 NZ per carbon equivalent was implemented. In September 2008, the New Zealand ETS was legislated, and it adopted all free allocation without caps. In July 2010, India introduced a nationwide carbon tax of about $ 1.07 US on coal, as coal was a major fuel resource for power generation in India. In November 2011, China had a pilot test of carbon trading in seven provinces and a national trading is expected to start in 2016. In July 2012, the Australian government introduced a carbon price of $ 23 AU per ton of emitted carbon equivalent, but this carbon price has been phased out.|$|R

In fact, most of benefits are earnings related and entitlement is conditional upon a contribution record. Social security contributions are paid by both employers and employees. However, in France, {{there is also a}} non-contributory element, a Beveridgean component. It refers to the tax-financed system and includes social assistance programs, minimum incomes and programs aimed at vocational training, and at integrating the young or long-term unemployed. These programs benefit those who {{do not have access to}} the social insurance system, such as the long-term unemployed or the young unemployed who have not contributed enough or have only a very short contribution period. Since the late 1970 s, several kinds of minimum incomes or social minima have been set up to compensate for the failures of the Bismarckian sector (the social insurance system). There are at least eight different minimum incomes: minimum income for old people over sixty-five years, allowance for disabled adults, integration <b>allowance,</b> <b>specific</b> solidarity <b>allowance,</b> lone parent allowance, minimum income for disabled people (for those who have small invalidity insurance benefits), widowhood allowance, and mini...|$|R
