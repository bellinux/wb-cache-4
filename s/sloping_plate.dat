Numerous past research studies have analysed the microstructural transformation of alloys in a mould, but few researchers have investigated this phenomenon on the cooling <b>slope</b> <b>plate.</b> A change in the microstructure of the alloy from dendritic to non-dendritic is clearly obtained as the alloy moves from the impact zone to bottom zone on the cooling <b>slope</b> <b>plate.</b> It is important to clarify the mechanism of microstructural evolution through nucleation and fragmentation of the primary phase arm for fundamental understanding of research. Analysis by optical microscope and scanning electron microscope reveals the evolution of the microstructure and intermetallic compounds of A 319 as it progresses along the cooling <b>slope</b> <b>plate.</b> The Vickers test was used to determine the hardness of the alloy thus produced. The results show the influence of the mould in obtaining a spheroidal microstructure; the microstructure in the bottom zone of the cooling <b>slope</b> <b>plate</b> is nearly spheroidal rather than fully spheroidal. The hardness of the alloy is enhanced when the microstructure is spheroidal and when the Mg 2 Si compound is present in the alloy...|$|R

In spite of growing application of semi-solid processed light alloys, a few works have been reported about semi-solid processing of iron and steel. In this research inclined plate was used to change dendritic structure of iron to globular one. The effects of length and <b>slope</b> of <b>plate</b> on the casting structure were examined. The results show that the process can effectively change the dendritic structure to globular. In the <b>slope</b> <b>plate</b> angle of 7. 5 ° and length of 560 mm with cooling rate of 67 Ks- 1 the optimum nodular graphite and solid globular particle were achieved. The results also show that by using <b>slope</b> <b>plate</b> inoculant fading can be prevented more easily since the total time of process is rather short. In addition, the semi-solid ductile cast iron prepared by inclined plate method, was reheated to examine the effect of reheating conditions on the microstructure and coarsening kinetics of the alloy. Solid fraction at different reheating temperatures and holding time was obtained and based on these results the optimum reheating temperature range was determined...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{experimental}} equipment with inclined plate cooling and shearing {{had been}} developed to prepare semi-solid 9 Cr 18 martensitic stainless steel slurry. The effects of inclined plate angel and length on microstructures refinement and spheroidization in semi-solid 9 Cr 18 alloy was investigated. The results show that when the molten alloy is flowing along the plate surface, the microstructure of the alloy involves from coarse dendrite to fine spherical grains, the <b>sloping</b> <b>plate</b> can provide sufficiently the undercooling for nucleation and lay a foundation for heterogeneous nucleation to form lots of nuclei of crystal internally and on the <b>sloping</b> <b>plate</b> surface, thus causing the melt to nucleate eruptively. <b>Sloping</b> <b>plate</b> angle and <b>sloping</b> <b>plate</b> length can affect the shear strength and shear time of the flow alloy on the <b>sloping</b> <b>plate</b> and thus influence alloy microstructure. Fine spherical grain in the semi-solid 9 Cr 18 slurry can be obtained at α= 45 °and L= 600 mm, the major grain equivalent diameters are less than 55 µm and more than 40 % of the grain shape factor is in 0. 75, exhibiting better grain fine degree and roundness. Using energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to investigate the liquid and solid phase in the 9 Cr 18 semi-solid slurry, iron content is lower and carbon and chromium content is higher in the liquid phase than in the solid phase which {{makes it possible to}} prepare the ‘FGM (functional gradient material) ’ with a high wear resistance in the surface and a good strength and toughness in the center. ...|$|E

40|$|Semi-solid forming (SSF) {{involves}} alloys with non-dendrite microstructure {{that contain}} spherical solid {{particles in the}} liquid matrix. This process is generally divided into three main steps: feedstock manufacturing, reheating and forming. Feedstock has the main effect on the cost and quality of product.

In this study a Cu plate with water and without water circulation was used to investigate the effect of pouring temperature, cooling rate during casting and solidification in the mold on the microstructure. Cast ingots with optimized microstructure were reheated in various time and temperatures in semi-solid region to obtain kinetics of globularization and solid grain growth. The near net shaping process of thixoforming has a number of advantages over conventional casting routes, e. g., improvement of mechanical properties.

In this paper, semi-solid billet of 9 Cr 18 steel was obtained through a wavelike <b>sloping</b> <b>plate.</b> Microstructure {{analysis of the}} semi-solid billet was conducted through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).

Globular primary austenite grains were first formed during partial solidification in the <b>sloping</b> <b>plate,</b> and then the rest liquid metal formed secondary austenite and Cr 7 C 3 eutectic structure surrounding the primary grains. Cr atoms had a concentration in the rest liquid side, which along with C atoms contributed to the formation of the Cr 7 C 3 carbide. Hardness in the primary solid grain area and the eutectic area was about 330 HV and 650 HV, respectively.

50|$|The {{popularity}} of vertical plate installations for indoor ranges is largely {{down to their}} minimal footprint compared with sand, granular or helical bullet traps and can consume less than 1 ft of a room’s available length - comprising {{the thickness of the}} steel plate, the thickness of the anti-splash curtain and 10 to 11 inches of air gap between. However, <b>sloping</b> steel <b>plates</b> will tend to wear less quickly - particularly on precision target ranges where fixed targets result in fire being concentrated into small areas. In such cases, small <b>sloping</b> <b>plates</b> or sacrificial vertical wear plates may be placed behind the targets as the primary bullet trap, whilst a large vertical plate covers the remainder of the wall as the defence zone to catch errant shots.

40|$|We {{examine the}} linear {{stability}} of a capillary rivulet {{under the assumption}} that it is shallow enough to be described by the lubrication approximation. It is shown that rivulets on a <b>sloping</b> <b>plate</b> are stable regardless of their parameters, whereas rivulets on the underside of a plate can be either stable or unstable, depending on their widths and the plate’s slope. For the case of a horizontal plate, sufficiently narrow rivulets are shown to be stable and sufficiently wide ones unstable, with the threshold width being π/ 2 (σ/gρ) 1 / 2 (ρ and σ are the liquid’s density and surface tension, g is the acceleration due to gravity). It is also shown that, even though the plate’s slope induces in a rivulet a sheared flow (which would normally be viewed as a source of instability) – in the present problem, it is a stabilizing factor. The corresponding stability criterion involving the rivulet’s width and the plate’s slope is computed, and it is demonstrated that, if the latter is sufficiently strong, all rivulets are stable regardless of their widths. 1...|$|E
