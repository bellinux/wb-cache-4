50|$|Riceville (also {{known as}} Hancock Tannery and Thirty-Nine/#39 Tannery) is {{a ghost town}} in East Hancock, Maine, {{specifically}} in Township 39 Middle Division. It was once home to a bark extract works owned by F. Shaw and Brothers Company, which owned many tanneries {{in the state of}} Maine. Later, the extract works was bought by James Rice and transferred to his company, Buzzell and Rice Tanning, which converted the plant into a tannery and began manufacturing <b>sole</b> <b>leather</b> from buffalo hides for shoemaking out of the township. Eventually Buzzell and Rice transferred the land back to Rice as an individual and he formed a new company, Hancock Leather, after which he began manufacturing <b>sole</b> <b>leather</b> once again. The community which sprang up around the tannery was home to 136 residents in 1890, eventually declining to 75 residents in 1900. The Riceville school had an enrollment of 21 pupils in 1900. In 1905, the tannery burned down and the town was abandoned shortly after. A post office existed from 1898 to 1906. There was nobody living in the township in 1910 and 1920.|$|R

5000|$|Important {{industries}} that flourished in Gowanda during the twentieth century, {{but which also}} polluted the adjoining Cattaraugus Creek, included the Peter Cooper Corporation Glue Factory and the Moench Tannery. The first tannery in Gowanda was begun by Samuel T. Munger in 1829, although one was already in operation by Smith Bartlett since 1815 in Collins. In 1829, to tan one side of leather in six months was considered quick work. Other tanneries in operation in Gowanda were by the Benton Brothers; K. Webster (which was purchased by Agle & Sons in 1860); and Albert Gaensslen. In 1852, Albert Gaensslen converted the former wool factory in Gowanda to a leather plant with 12 liquor vats. The Gaensslen Brothers tannery manufactured only shoe <b>sole</b> <b>leather.</b> Gaensslen Brothers tannery was established in 1855; reorganizing as Gaensslen, Fisher & Company in 1896, following the partnership with E.C.
