40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} Galaxy {{has become a}} popular {{workflow}} management system in bioinformatics, due to its ease of installation, use and extension. The availability of Semantic Web-oriented tools in Galaxy, however, is limited. This {{is also the case}} for Semantic Web Services such as those provided by the SADI project, i. e. services that consume and produce RDF. Here we present SADI-Galaxy, a tool generator that deploys selected SADI Services as typical Galaxy tools. Results: SADI-Galaxy is a Galaxy tool generator: through SADI-Galaxy, any SADI-compliant service becomes a Galaxy tool that can participate in other out-standing features of Galaxy such as data storage, history, workflow creation, and publication. Galaxy {{can also be used to}} execute and combine SADI services as it does with other Galaxy tools. Finally, we have semi-automated the packing and unpacking of data into RDF such that other Galaxy tools can easily be combined with SADI <b>services,</b> <b>plugging</b> the rich SADI Semantic Web Service environment into the popular Galaxy ecosystem. Conclusions: SADI-Galaxy bridges the gap between Galaxy, an easy to use but “static ” workflow system with a wide user-base, and SADI, a sophisticated, semantic, discovery-based framework for Web Services, thus benefiting both user communities...|$|R
5000|$|Between the 1860s and the 1940s, miners worked about 300 pit mines, mostly small, in what {{later became}} the park. The most successful, the Lost Horse Mine, {{produced}} gold and silver worth about $5 million in today's currency. Johnny Lang and others, the original owners of the Lost Horse Mine, installed a two-stamp mill to process ore at the site, and the next owner, J.D.

Most of the structures associated with the mine fell apart, and for safety reasons the National Park <b>Service</b> <b>plugged</b> the mine, which had collapsed. The Desert Queen Mine on Keys' Desert Queen Ranch was another productive gold mine. In the early 1930s, Keys bought a gasoline-powered two-stamp mill, the Wall Street Mill, and moved it to his ranch to process ore. The ranch and mill were added to the NRHP in 1975 and the mine in 1976. Some of the mines in the park yielded copper, zinc, and iron.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is the Internet Protocol-based service-provisioning {{framework}} for mobile and fixed-line convergence, as {{specified by the}} Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP).

The goal of Wrens is to provide the abstractions and the infrastructure that facilitate rapid development, extension and deployment of network services. The design of Wrens is based on four principles. First, the communication structure of services should be specified explicitly {{in a form that}} can be understood by the infrastructure. This allows the infrastructure to automatically instantiate complex services, detect many kinds of failures and (in many cases) automatically repair them. In addition, it allows service designers to rapidly prototype <b>services</b> by <b>plugging</b> together existing <b>service</b> components. Second, complex services should be constructed as a collection of interacting service modules that communicate via named channels.
