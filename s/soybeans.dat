5|$|In 1943, the U.S. Department of the Army {{contracted}} the botanist and bioethicist Arthur Galston, {{who discovered the}} defoliants later used in Agent Orange, and his employer University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana to {{study the effects of}} 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops. Galston, then {{a graduate student at the}} University of Illinois, in his research and 1943 Ph.D. dissertation focused on finding a chemical means to make <b>soybeans</b> flower and fruit earlier. He discovered both that 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of <b>soybeans</b> and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the <b>soybeans.</b> From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the Bushnell Army Airfield in Florida.

5|$|Bowman v. Monsanto Co., 569 U.S. ___ (2013) was a United States Supreme Court patent {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court unanimously affirmed {{the decision of the}} Federal Circuit that the patent exhaustion doctrine does not permit a farmer to plant and grow saved, patented seeds without the patent owner's permission. The case arose after Vernon Hugh Bowman, an Indiana farmer, bought transgenic soybean crop seeds from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season. Monsanto originally sold the seed from which these <b>soybeans</b> were grown to farmers under a limited use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting. The farmers sold their soybean crops (also seeds) to the local grain elevator, from which Bowman then bought them. After Bowman replanted the crop seeds for his second harvest, Monsanto filed a lawsuit claiming that he infringed on their patents by replanting <b>soybeans</b> without a license. In response, Bowman argued that Monsanto's claims were barred under the doctrine of patent exhaustion, because all future generations of <b>soybeans</b> were embodied in the first generation that was originally sold.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the optimum <b>soybean</b> planting date, row spacing, cultivar and oat harvesting date in an oat-soybean relay intercropping system. Two experiments were carried out in 1983, 1984, and 1985. Experiment I included three cropping system row spacings and three <b>soybean</b> planting dates. Experiment II included three <b>soybean</b> cultivars, three cropping system row spacings, and three oat harvesting dates;Relay intercropping <b>soybean</b> into oat significantly reduced grain yields of oat and <b>soybean.</b> The oat plant characters measured were not significantly affected by cropping systems. On the contrary, relay intercropping decreased the performance of all <b>soybean</b> plant characters except for number of branches per plant. Alteration of cropping system row spacing did not affect any <b>soybean</b> plant character, but significantly affected oat grain yield and test weight. The greatest oat grain yield and test weight were obtained when <b>soybean</b> was relay interplanted in 25 -cm cropping system row spacing;Neither <b>soybean</b> planting date nor <b>soybean</b> cultivar had a significant effect on oat plant characters. The opposite was true for <b>soybean</b> plant characters. The earlier the <b>soybean</b> planting date, the greater the grain yield and the larger the seed size of <b>soybean.</b> <b>Soybean</b> cultivar significantly affected <b>soybean</b> plant characters measured, but not the grain yield and <b>soybean</b> plant height at oat harvest. Pella <b>soybean</b> had greater seed weight and plant height than Hobbit and Asgrow 3127 <b>soybean.</b> Regardless of <b>soybean</b> cultivar, the greatest <b>soybean</b> grain yield, seed weight, and plant height were achieved when <b>soybean</b> was relay interplanted in 51 -cm row spacing;Oat harvest at physiological maturity resulted in greater oat grain yield and other plant characters as compared to harvest at harvest maturity. For <b>soybean,</b> the earlier the oat was harvested, the greater the <b>soybean</b> yield and seed weight;Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) values revealed that LER was not affected by either <b>soybean</b> cultivar, <b>soybean</b> row spacing, or oat harvesting date.

50|$|Infestation of <b>soybean</b> aphids on <b>soybean</b> can be {{classified}} into three stages. The first stage occurs when alatae migrate to <b>soybean</b> in late May and early June.

In these early colonies, <b>soybean</b> aphids are typically grouped on tender, young leaves of <b>soybean</b> plants.

Studies have demonstrated a positive correlation exists between upper leaf nitrogen content of <b>soybean</b> and the occurrence of <b>soybean</b> aphids.
