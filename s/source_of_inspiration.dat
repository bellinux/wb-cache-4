40|$|Drawing {{ideas from}} {{previous}} designs and other <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> {{is a universal}} part of all human designing, but the forms that adaptation takes, and the ways it is conceptualised both differ between industries. This paper describes how <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> are used in commercial knitwear design. Knitwear designers actively search for <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration,</b> which they use both to define the space of designs that will meet their purposes and tune their tacit perceptions of what is appropriate, and {{in the development of}} individual designs. They employ active strategies for guiding their idea generation actions to produce the ideas the situation requires. Knitwear designers routinely use a very broad range <b>of</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration,</b> and are explicitly aware and open about how they use them. Identifying a good source is often the key creative step in knitwear design, and being able to do this well is a vital skill for a designer. The paper makes some provisional generalisations about the structure of design processes driven by thinking with <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration,</b> to provoke and facilitate comparisons with other industries...|$|R

5|$|An Egyptian historian, {{known by}} his Greek name as Manetho (c. 3rd century BC), {{was the first}} to compile a {{comprehensive}} history of Egypt.

However, the primary sources for Manetho's work were the king list chronicles of previous Egyptian dynasties.|$|E
5|$|El Greco's {{personality}} and work were a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for poet Rainer Maria Rilke. One set of Rilke's poems (Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II., 1913) was based directly on El Greco's Immaculate Conception. Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, who felt a great spiritual affinity for El Greco, called his autobiography Report to Greco {{and wrote a}} tribute to the Cretan-born artist.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien began devising the {{language}} around 1910 and restructured the grammar several times until Quenya reached its final state.

5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} several {{significant}} works of modern literature. Her romantic attachment with Pericles has inspired {{some of the}} most famous novelists and poets of the last centuries. In particular the romanticists of the 19th century and the historical novelists of the 20th century found in their story an inexhaustible <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration.</b> In 1835 Lydia Maria Child, an American abolitionist, novelist, and journalist, published Philothea, a classical romance set in the days of Pericles and Aspasia. This book is regarded as the most successful and elaborate of the author's productions, because the female characters, especially Aspasia, are portrayed with great beauty and delicacy.|$|E
5|$|Chronicles {{edited by}} Kogălniceanu and Costache Negruzzi were the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for several {{historical}} novelists, beginning with Alexandru Odobescu. His {{relationship with the}} peasant representative to the ad hoc Divan, Ion Roată, is briefly mentioned in an anecdote authored by Ion Creangă (Moș Ion Roată). He is also {{the subject of a}} short writing by Ion Luca Caragiale (first published by Vatra in 1894). Symbolist poet Dimitrie Anghel, whose father, the National Liberal parliamentarian Dimitrie A. Anghel, had been well acquainted with Kogălniceanu, authored a memoir detailing the fluctuating relationship between the two political figures, as well as detailing one of the former Premier's last speeches.|$|E
5|$|David was {{conceptualized}} {{as a character}} to provide a non-human perspective for the theme of meeting one's creators in Prometheus, with him representing the next generation {{in a line of}} creators who finds himself disillusioned by his predecessors. Fassbender, who was director Ridley Scott's first choice for the role, helped fashion the character to share traits with T. E. Lawrence, who was a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> as a control freak caught between two cultures- the cultures being humanity and synthetics, in David's case. As the series progresses, David's behaviors and motivations evolve from a mysterious agent with ambiguous motivations to a character directly opposing the well-being of humanity.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{start from the}} {{position}} that <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> {{play an important role}} in the design process albeit in a frequently intangible way. We present the Inspiration Card Workshop as a collaborative method for combining findings from domain studies, represented in Domain Cards, with <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> from applications <b>of</b> technology, represented in Technology Cards, to create new concepts for design. We report our findings from three projects in which we have used the method and argue that the use <b>of</b> <b>Inspiration</b> Cards can successfully frame and guide workshops with disparate participants and bring various <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> into the design process. We furthermore compare the method to four related methods in the design process, namely Future Workshops, Metaphorica...|$|R
5|$|El Greco's {{dramatic}} and expressionistic style {{was met with}} puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco {{is regarded as a}} precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.|$|E
5|$|French typefounders of the 16th century assiduously {{examined}} Manutius's work (and, it is thought, De Aetna in particular) as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration.</b> This examination {{extended to}} {{in some cases}} copying his first 'M' shown in De Aetna which had no serif pointing out of the letter at top right, a design considered very eccentric. (It has been suggested {{to be the result}} of defective casting, especially since Manutius' later fonts do not show it.) The Griffo font was only cut in a single size, so French punchcutters made modified versions of the design to suit different sizes, with a more delicate structure at larger sizes.|$|E
5|$|Goldman pursued an {{independent}} education on her own, however, and {{soon began to}} study the political turmoil around her, particularly the Nihilists responsible for assassinating Alexander II of Russia. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done? (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing cooperative. The book enthralled Goldman and remained a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> throughout her life.|$|E

5|$|Le Père Goriot (Old Father Goriot, 1835) was {{his next}} success, in which Balzac transposes {{the story of}} King Lear to 1820s Paris in order to rage at a society bereft of all love save the love of money. The {{centrality}} of a father in this novel matches Balzac's own position—not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary, Jules Sandeau, but {{also the fact that}} he had fathered a child, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, with his otherwise-married lover, Maria Du Fresnay, who had been his <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for Eugénie Grandet.|$|E
5|$|One <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for Tristan und Isolde was the {{philosophy}} of Arthur Schopenhauer, notably his The World as Will and Representation, to which Wagner had been introduced in 1854 by his poet friend Georg Herwegh.

His personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be Schopenhauer's philosophy, a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition.
