40|$|In {{the past}} ten years, many exemplar {{projects}} are completed in China to encourage the sharing of knowledge and experience of sustainability. Many of these projects are landmark buildings, and because they can attract more public attentions, they raise more awareness of sustainable development. However, school projects are rarely mentioned in the news and annual inspirational project lists. The fundamental point {{of this paper is}} to challenge the common concept in China that school buildings are only used exclusively by children in formal education. According to the paper’s review of the <b>school</b> <b>schemes</b> in England and Wales, not only the inspirational sustainable schools created the opportunities and responsibilities to accelerate positive changes, but also they developed a vision of an asset that supports lifelong learning and sustainable lifestyles for the whole community. In this paper, the definition of a ‘sustainable school’ is summarised by comparing the statements and concepts in England and Wales. Moreover, a wide range of benefits gained by project stakeholders and communities are also demonstrated through case studies. In the end, lessons and innovations which can be learnt by Chinese school projects are concluded. The illustrations provided by this paper do not aim to solve all issues of promoting a sustainable school in China, but to open people’s minds to the impacts of their actions, and to build the knowledge and cooperative framework to promote public sustainable projects...|$|E
40|$|In England, food {{technology}} {{is part of}} the curriculum for design and technology but the purpose of {{food technology}} education is not clear. Over the years, food on the school curriculum has generally been seen as a practical, learning to cook, activity initially for girls to prepare them for domestic employment or housewifery. As society has developed many aspects of design and technology teaching have also developed, to include teaching about new materials, new equipment and new processes but we argue that food technology has developed less slowly than other areas of design and technology. We question whether the current food technology curriculum provides an appropriate education for pupils in the twenty-first century. The research involved interviews with stakeholders to develop a conceptual framework for a modern food curriculum. <b>School</b> <b>schemes</b> of work and examination specifications were then analysed against this conceptual framework, and teachers and pupils were surveyed about their experiences of teaching and learning in food technology. The findings indicate that the main purpose of food technology on the school curriculum is still linked to developing pupils’ practical food-making skills as a ‘life skill’, although one which is now available to boys and girls. We suggest that food technology education should serve a different and more sophisticated purpose in the twenty-first century; it could help pupils to develop their understanding of the underlying scientific principles, broaden their general knowledge of food-related issues and better prepare them for citizenship and employment...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{implementation}} of the Welsh Network of Healthy <b>School</b> <b>Schemes</b> (WNHSS) at national, local and school levels, using a systems approach drawing on the Ottawa Charter. Design/methodology/approach: The approach takes the form of a single-case study using data from a documentary analysis, interviews with Healthy Schools Co-ordinators (n= 23) and stakeholder (n~ 93) discussion of interim findings at three regional workshops. Findings: There was almost universal adherence to a national framework based on Ottawa Charter principles. Substantial progress had been made with advocacy and mediation, although the framework provided less specific guidance regarding enablement. All-Wales training for co-ordinators, the commitment of co-ordinators to working across administrative and professional boundaries, and support from local education and health partnerships, were important determinants of healthy school schemes' growth and efficiency. Primary schools were more successful than secondary schools in embedding health-related changes. Research limitations/implications: Although findings are largely based on indirect evidence, the use of a social-ecological model of evaluation provided valuable insights into implementation processes at multiple levels. Findings suggest that strong national support benefits programme development and dissemination and should include effective monitoring of local performance. The national strategic environment was influential at all levels of programme implementation. Priorities for further research include application of the social-ecological model and organisational theory to investigate indicators of sustainability and influences on inequalities in health in school health promotion programmes. Originality/value: The review illustrates the importance of evaluating health promotion programmes at multiple levels using a systems approach. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|E
