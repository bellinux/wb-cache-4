The implicit self may thus {{play a key role}} in affect regulation and volitional action control. The self plays a vital role in people’s emotional lives. Such common emotions as guilt, shame, and nostalgia only arise in relation to the self (Sedikides, Wildschut, & Baden, 2004; Tangney & Dearing, 2002). Likewise, people’s sense of self-esteem shapes their emotional reactions to success and failure (Brown & Dutton, 1995). Finally, affirming the self protects people against negative ruminations and stress (Cresswell et al., 2005; Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, & Dijksterhuis, 1999), whereas focusing on the self’s shortcomings renders people vulnerable to anxiety and depression (Higgins, 1987; Pyszczynski & Greenberg, 1987). To date, research on the interface between self and emotion has relied almost exclusively on conscious, explicit measures. Recent work, however, suggests that self and emotion are to a large extent mediated by unconscious, implicit processe...|$|R

40|$|Changes in rat {{anterior}} {{pituitary gland}} LU secretion {{were correlated with}} changes in morphology of pituitary LH cells during a simulated preovulatory surge of LU in serum. In phenobarbital blocked proestrous rats, LHRH was infused i. v. at a constant rate (50 ng/h) previously shown to restore the LH surge. Rats were decapitated prior to or {{after the start of}} L 1 -IRH infusion. Pars distalis tissue was stained with anti-rat LHI 3 sera and examined by electron microscopy. The basic cell type which stained in control rats was polygonal to ovoid. Granules were, for the most part, evenly distributed throughout the cell or concentrated at 1 pole. The LHRH infused rats exhibited a cell type with a similar shape and granule size. LURI-I infusion appeared to result in LU cells becoming less irregular in shape, but our criteria for classification were probably too strict to demonstrate this quantitatively. Pituitary LH concentration and LH granule number were not decreased at 15 and 30 mm of the simulated LH surge despite a 6 -fold increase in serum LU at these times (LHRH <b>self</b> <b>priming</b> period).

40|$|Recently Burton, Bruce and Johnston (1990) have {{presented}} an interactive activation and competition model of face recognition. They {{have shown that}} this IAC model presents a parsimonious account of semantic and repetition priming effects with faces. In addition, {{a number of new}} predictions are evident from the model's structure. One such prediction is highlighted by Burton et al. themselves - that for short prime-target stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) a face should prime the recognition of a target name (or vice versa), 'self priming'. This thesis examined this prediction and found that it held for a design in which items were repeated across prime type conditions (same, associated, neutral and unrelated). Further, cross (face prime/name target) and within-domain (name prime/name target) designs were found to produce equivalent degrees of <b>self</b> and semantic <b>priming</b> (Experiments 1 and 2). Closer examination of the Burton et al. model suggested that the effect of domain equivalence for <b>self</b> <b>priming</b> should not hold for a design in which the stimulus items are not repeated across prime type conditions (i. e. subjects are presented with each item only once). This prediction was confirmed in Experiments 3, 4, 5 and 6. The time courses of <b>self</b> and semantic <b>priming</b> were investigated in two experiments where the interstimulus interval (ISI) between prime and target, and prime presentation times were varied. The results proved difficult to accommodate within the Burton et al. model, but it is argued that they did not provide a sufficient basis on which to reject the model. Finally, the <b>self</b> <b>priming</b> paradigm was applied to the study of distinctiveness effects. Faces judged to be distinctive in appearance were found to produce more facilitation than faces judged to be typical in appearance. Similarly, caricatured representation of faces were found to produce more facilitation than veridical or anticaricatured representations. The results of the distinctiveness studies are discussed in terms of the Valentine's (1991 a; 1991 b) exemplar-based coding model and Burton, Bruce and Johnston's (1990) IAC implementation. It is concluded that the results of these experiments lend support to the Burton et al. model...|$|R

Backup generators was the most common stationary diesel equipment type (56 %), followed by backup <b>pumps</b> (37 %), <b>prime</b> generators (3 %), <b>prime</b> <b>pumps</b> (2 %), and others (1 %). Air compressors were found to be primarily portable and therefore were a negligible stationary source category, both in terms of population and emissions.

40|$|The {{development}} and first test {{results of a}} novel micropump aimed at achieving elevated now rates are presented in this paper.

The microvalves are derived from a prior micropump design and optimized for elevated flow. Alternative valve sizes were employed and show the anticipated effect on the pump's flow characteristics. Flow rates of up to 85 ml/min with water and 310 ml/min with air have thus been achieved. These results promise application potential beyond the intended use in medical air humidification.

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether damage after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest can be diminished by changing <b>pump</b> <b>prime</b> components when reinstituting cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods: Fifteen piglets (2 - 3 months old) were cooled to 19 °C by using the alpha-stat pH strategy. Five were cooled and rewarmed without ischemia (control animals), and the other 10 piglets underwent 90 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Of these, 5 were rewarmed and reperfused without altering the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit blood prime. In the other 5 animals, the bypass blood prime was modified (leukocyte depleted, hypocalcemic, hypermagnesemic, pH-stat, normoxic, mannitol, and an Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor) during circulatory arrest before starting warm reperfusion. Oxidant injury was assessed {{on the basis of}} conjugated dienes, vascular changes on the basis of endothelin levels, myocardial function on the basis of cardiac output and dopamine need, lung injury on the basis of pulmonary vascular resistance and oxygenation, and cellular damage on the basis of release of creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase. Neurologic assessment (score 0, normal; score 500, brain death) was done 6 hours after discontinuing cardiopulmonary bypass. Results: Compared with animals undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass without ischemia (control animals), deep hypothermic circulatory arrest without modification of the reperfusate produced an oxidant injury (conjugated dienes increased 0. 78 vs 1. 71 absorbance (Abs) 240 nmol/L per 0. 5 mL, P <. 001 vs control animals), depressed cardiac output (6. 0 vs 4. 0 L/min, P <. 05 vs control subjects), prolonged dopamine need (P <. 001 vs control subjects), elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (74 % vs 197 %, P <. 05 vs control subjects), reduced oxygenation (P <. 01 vs control subjects), increased neurologic injury (56 vs 244, P <. 001 vs control subjects), and increased release of creatine kinase (2695 vs 6974 U/L, P <. 05 vs control subjects), aspartate aminotransferase (144 vs 229 U/L), and endothelin (1. 02 vs 2. 56 pg/mL, P <. 001 vs control subjects). Conversely, the oxidant injury was markedly limited (conjugated dienes of 0. 85 ± 0. 09 Abs 240 nmol/L per 0. 5 mL, P <. 001 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime)</b> with modification of cardiopulmonary bypass prime, resulting in increased cardiac output (5. 1 ± 0. 8 L/min), minimal dopamine need (P <. 001 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> no increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (44 % ± 31 %, P <. 01 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime)</b> or endothelin levels (0. 64 ± 0. 15 pg/mL, P <. 001 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> complete recovery of oxygenation (P <. 01 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> reduced neurologic damage (144 ± 33, P <. 05 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> and lower release of aspartate aminotransferase (124 ± 23 U/L, P <. 05 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime)</b> and creatine kinase (3366 ± 918, P <. 05 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime).</b> Conclusions: A global reperfusion injury after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was identified and changed. The injury is mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals, resulting in organ and endothelial dysfunction. Modification of global organ and endothelial damage is achieved by modifying the blood prime in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit to deliver a controlled global reperfusate when reinstituting bypass.
