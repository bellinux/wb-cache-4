50|$|Probation in Thailand is {{currently}} {{under the auspices}} Department of Probation, Ministry of Justice, Thailand. It has been developed through various amendment and enactment of laws and regulation along with the advancement of knowledge within criminal justice and criminology sphere. The probation system was firstly introduced into Thailand in 1952 and applied to the Juvenile Detention Centre under the Juvenile and Family Court.In 1956, the use of probation was explicitly stipulated {{for the first time}} in the modern Criminal Code of Thailand as a condition of sentence or punishment in adult criminal cases. Probation was never formally invoked, however, until the Proceedings of Probation Act 1979 was enacted which was nearly twenty years later with the establishment of the first probation office, Central Probation Office, was also established correspondingly as a division within the Office of Judicial Affairs under the Criminal Court, Ministry of Justice. In 1992, the Central Probation Office was elevated to be part of the Department of Probation separated from the court with the main roles and responsibilities in adult probationers under <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> or punishment. Responsibility for juvenile probation was then transferred to the Department of Juvenile Observation and Protection and probation for parolees was transferred to the Department of Corrections under Ministry of Interior.The fragmentation of responsibilities led to the revision of agencies roles and responsibilities in 2001 when the Cabinet has issued a resolution to re-organise probation works and the Department of Probation was proposed to be the main agency in charge of pretrial, trial and posttrial probation only for adult offender, the aftercare service and drug rehabilitation for offenders to the Department.In 2016, further the promulgation of the Probation Act 2016 significantly ameliorates and consolidates roles and responsibilities of the Department and probation officers whilst offering better mechanism in order to support the essence of the implementation of non-custodial measure and rehabilitation of offenders.

After she stopped indulging his expenses, he [...] "so barbarously ill-treated her, that she was obliged to have recourse to a magistrate for protection against his outrages". He also conducted a sexual relationship with the Duchess' granddaughter, Charlotte Calvert, in the Spring of 1706, and was rumoured to father a child by her, born on 23 April 1707. The case went to the Old Bailey, where Fielding was prosecuted and found guilty for bigamy at his trial on 4 December 1706. The marriage between Fielding and the Duchess was annulled, but he claimed benefit of clergy, escaping the sentence for bigamy.

He applied to the commandant of the prison for a <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> his <b>sentence</b> so that he, and other soldiers of New Zealand and Australia, could return to the front lines. His request was passed to Lieutenant General William Birdwood, commanding officer of I ANZAC Corps. In late August 1916, Braithwaite became involved in a mutiny. Blargies had already been the scene of an earlier mutiny by British soldiers protesting at their treatment. This time, an Australian prisoner had become unruly and began resisting attempts by guards to confine him. Braithwaite intervened and dragged the Australian away from the guards and a gathering crowd of Australian prisoners, already disgruntled at their harsh treatment. He later claimed that he reminded the struggling Australian of the petition to Birdwood and not to jeopardise this and that his (Braithwaite's) actions were aimed at calming the situation. However, he, along with three others, were charged with mutiny.|$|R

This fact was presently furnished by the Princess. After one of her periodical disappearances,--this time unusually prolonged,--she astonished Logport by returning with a half-breed baby of a week old in her arms.

Soft-hearted Mrs. Brown endeavored vainly to get a mitigation or <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sentence.</b> But, as on a former occasion, the Princess took matters into her own hands. A few mornings afterwards, a wicker cradle containing an Indian baby was found hanging on the handle of the door of the First Baptist Church. It was the Parthian arrow of the flying Princess.

40|$|Article 27 - 2 of the Penal Code in Japan {{requires}} that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> {{execution of the}} sentence' should be judged in view of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing re-offending'. Some, on the other hand, argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be "balanced" with the criminal responsibility of the offender, which is {{greater than that of}} those whose execution <b>of</b> the <b>sentence</b> is fully suspended and is smaller than that <b>of</b> those whose <b>sentence</b> is partially executed. However, I think that this method of judgment ignores the requirements of Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility.
