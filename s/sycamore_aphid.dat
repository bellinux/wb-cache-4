40|$|<b>Sycamore</b> <b>aphids</b> (Drepanosiphum platanoidis) were {{transferred}} between two temperatures at adult moult {{in order to}} investigate {{the relative importance of}} developmental history and adult experience on reproductive activity. Both influenced the duration of the pre-reproductive delay and first offspring weight. Initial reproductive rates depended only on adult experience. Aphids transferred from 10 ° to 20 ° were stressed and had increased maintenance costs because of their large size. A high proportion of their embryos were resorbed and progeny weight was low. Developmental experience was a constraint on the reproductive patterns of aphids experiencing changes in environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that seasonal changes in sycamore aphid,Drepanosiphum platanoidis (Schr.), recruitment {{are determined by}} changes in food quality and aphid population density was tested. There was no clear association between the reproductive activity of the <b>sycamore</b> <b>aphid</b> and the seasonal changes in specific amino acids or groups of amino acids in extracts of sycamore,Acer pseudoplatanus L., leaves. Seasonal changes in reproductive activity tracked the changes in total amino acids of the leaf tissue of the host, but with a short time delay. High numbers of adult aphids appeared to depress reproductive activity. A regression analysis of the results revealed that total amino acids the previous week and current numbers of adult aphids significantly affected <b>sycamore</b> <b>aphid</b> reproductive activity. The results of this analysis support the above hypothesis, that the marked seasonal changes in the total quantity of amino acids in sycamore leaves and intraspecific competition for this resource, through its effect on adult weight, shape the seasonal cycle in the reproductive activity of the <b>sycamore</b> <b>aphid...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ovariole {{number in}} both the <b>sycamore</b> <b>aphid</b> and the bird cherry-oat aphid was {{shown to be a}} {{constant}} for a particular generation. This generation specific ovariole number remained constant, despite varied nymphal experiences. The number of embryos per ovariole in the <b>sycamore</b> <b>aphid</b> was dependent {{on the size of the}} adult aphid. In the bird cherry-oat aphid, the number of embryos per ovariole was a constant, but the number of pigmented embryos present was a function of the size of the aphid at adult moult. Ovariole number, an index of reproductive potential, was thus concluded to be the result of an intrinsic and programmed factor...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{populations of}} the <b>sycamore</b> <b>aphid</b> tend to reach an {{asymptotic}} density in the autumn, irrespective of the initial number of aphids colonizing the trees. This population behaviour is not observed in the field populations (see Wellings et al. 1985), where immigration and density-disturbing weather conditions may be important. Analysis of {{the data from the}} laboratory populations identified two density-dependent processes: flight by adult first generation aphids and reduced fecundity of second generation adults as a result of crowding experience. Growth and development rates of individual aphids were influenced by the nutritional value of their host plant and by crowding density. Other laboratory experiments indicated that the effect of crowding was mediated through the host plant, rather than solely through direct behavioural interactions. This effect was shown to act during development and the pre-reproductive period, {{as well as on the}} reproductive rate of adults. The role of these intraspecific processes in the regulation of <b>sycamore</b> <b>aphid</b> numbers is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Leaf age of sycamore, Acer pseudoplatanus, had {{a marked}} {{effect on the}} {{performance}} of the aphid, Drepanosiphum platanoidis. Aphids reared on young leaves grew at significantly greater rates, had shorter development times and achieved greater adult weights than those reared on older leaves. Leaf infestation history had no significant effect on aphid performance. Aphid infestation at bud-burst had a marked effect on the host-plant, reducing the area of the leaves to less than half the area of leaves on uninfested trees. Analysis of the foliar free amino-acid compositions indicated that no major changes in leaf quality occur as a result of prolonged aphid infestation. These results are discussed in the context of current theories of the role of induced changes in plant quality on herbivore populations, with specific reference to the population dynamics of the <b>sycamore</b> <b>aphid...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{sequence of}} sexuparae of the <b>sycamore</b> <b>aphid,</b> Drepanosiphum platanoidis (Schrank) (Homoptera: Callaphididae), {{observed in the}} field and glasshouse was examined to elucidate the relationship between host nutrition and sex ratio. The observations were made in autumn when the transition from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction occurred. A switch occurred in the reproductive sequence of the sexuparae. The production of apterous sexual females (oviparae) was followed by alate males, after a brief reproductive pause lasting 2. 5 - 4. 0 days. The switchover period was relatively constant across treatments and years. On poor hosts, the first appearance of the oviparae was a day later, whereas the first appearance of males was a day earlier than those on good nutrition. The primary sex ratio (i. e., proportion of males) was numerically female biased. Under semi-natural field conditions it was 0. 22, but altered to 0. 18 and 0. 29, respectively, under poor and good host nutrition in the glasshouse. In both the field and glasshouse, nymphal development time was significantly longer in oviparae (ca. 22 days) than in males (ca. 18 days). The time from birth to adult was significantly shorter on good hosts (oviparae: 20 days; males: 17 days) than on poor hosts (oviparae: 23 days; males: 19 days). The proportion of nymphs surviving to the adult moult was not dependent on sex in both the field and glasshouse, but the chances of survival were slightly enhanced under good (88 %) compared with poor (82 %) host nutritive status. In conclusion, the order of morph production and differences in maturation times ensured the synchronisation of the sexes so that mating and oviposition opportunities were optimised before the onset of winter. The female-bias in the sex ratio maximised the fitness of sexuparae, and reduced the chances of local mate competition by economising in members of the competing sex. © 2005 The Netherlands Entomological Society...|$|E
