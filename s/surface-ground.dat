The substrate influences the shape {{and size of the}} samples through spreading effects. Later, at the firing stage, interaction with the substrate can involve reactions that adulterate the composition or low adhesion that can result in sample loss during transport. We describe substrate pretreatment with a perfluorinated silane to provide control of droplet size and prevent spreading. Substrate compatibility during high temperature firing is more problematic and we discuss the limited material choices. One approach seeks a substrate that will support the library from beginning to end of the preparatory stage and during storage. An alternative method involves firing samples on low adhesion substrates followed by pneumatic transfer to a silver electroding paste and a low temperature firing.

The same <b>surface-ground</b> silicon nitride and Inconel 625 alloy specimens were used for all measurements in this investigation. Significant differences in arithmetic average roughness, root-mean-square roughness, and peak-to-valley roughness were obtained when comparing data from the various topography measuring instruments. Non-contact methods agreed better with the others on the metal specimen than on the ceramic specimen.

40|$|An optical method {{based on}} the laser light {{scattering}} technique for surface roughness measurement of tapered roller bearings was developed. This technique {{was based on an}} analysis of the Bi-directional Reflective Distribution Function (BRDF) of the scattering pattern from a bearing surface. A He-Ne laser (λ = 0. 6328 μm) was used as a coherent light source to illuminate the surface of the roller bearings. They were <b>surface-ground</b> and honed to obtain 1 -D and 2 -D surface texture in order to improve lubrication. The scattering pattern was captured by a CCD camera and then digitized by a frame grabber board on a PC-AT computer for analysis. The BRDF of the scattering pattern was obtained in order to derive the zero and second moments. These were used as the optical roughness parameters of the surface and then correlated to the mechanical root mean square (RMS) roughness and the RMS slope of the surface profile which were obtained from a stylus instrument. Correlation curves of the zero moment versus the RMS roughness and the second moment versus the RMS slope of 1 -D and 2 -D surface texture roller bearings were obtained separately. Good correlations were observed, and the curves showed the relationship between the optical roughness parameters and the mechanical roughness parameters.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for the design and construction of simple foil thrust bearings intended for parametric performance testing and low marginal costs, supporting continued development of oil-free turbomachinery. A bearing backing plate is first machined and <b>surface-ground</b> to produce flat and parallel faces. Partial-arc slots needed to retain the foil components are then machined into the plate by wire electrical discharge machining. Slot thicknesses achievable by a single wire pass are appropriate to accommodate the practical range of foil thicknesses, leaving a small clearance in this hinged joint to permit limited motion. The backing plate is constructed from a nickel-based superalloy (Inconel 718) to allow heat treatment of the entire assembled bearing, {{as well as to}} permit hightemperature operation. However, other dimensionally stable materials, such as precipitation-hardened stainless steel, can also be used for this component depending on application. The top and bump foil blanks are cut from stacks of annealed Inconel X- 750 foil by the same EDM process. The bump foil has several azimuthal slits separating it into five individual bump strips. This configuration allows for variable bump spacing, which helps to accommodate the effects of the varying surface velocity, thermal crowning, centrifugal dishing, and misalignment. Rectangular tabs on the foil blanks fit into the backing plate slots. For this application, a rather traditional set of conventionally machined dies is selected, and bump foil blanks are pressed into the dies for forming. This arrangement produces a set of bump foil dies for foil thrust bearings that provide for relatively inexpensive fabrication of various bump configurations, and employing methods and features from the public domain...|$|E
40|$|In topographically flat wetlands, where {{shallow water}} table and {{conductive}} soil may develop {{as a result}} of wet and dry seasons, the connection between surface water and groundwater is not only present, but perhaps the key factor dominating the magnitude and direction of water flux. Due to their complex characteristics, modeling waterflow through wetlands using more realistic process formulations (integrated <b>surface-ground</b> water and vegetative resistance) is an actual necessity. ^ This dissertation focused on developing an integrated surface – subsurface hydrologic simulation numerical model by programming and testing the coupling of the USGS MODFLOW- 2005 Groundwater Flow Process (GWF) package (USGS, 2005) with the 2 D surface water routing model: FLO- 2 D (O’Brien et al., 1993). The coupling included the necessary procedures to numerically integrate and verify both models as a single computational software system that will heretofore be referred to as WHIMFLO- 2 D (Wetlands Hydrology Integrated Model). An improved physical formulation of flow resistance through vegetation in shallow waters based on the concept of drag force was also implemented for the simulations of floodplains, while the use of the classical methods (e. g., Manning, Chezy, Darcy-Weisbach) to calculate flow resistance has been maintained for the canals and deeper waters. ^ A preliminary demonstration exercise WHIMFLO- 2 D in an existing field site was developed for the Loxahatchee Impoundment Landscape Assessment (LILA), an 80 acre area, located at the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wild Life Refuge in Boynton Beach, Florida. After applying a number of simplifying assumptions, results have illustrated the ability of the model to simulate the hydrology of a wetland. In this illustrative case, a comparison between measured and simulated stages level showed an average error of 0. 31 % with a maximum error of 2. 8 %. Comparison of measured and simulated groundwater head levels showed an average error of 0. 18 % with a maximum of 2. 9 %. ^ The coupling of FLO- 2 D model with MODFLOW- 2005 model and the incorporation of the dynamic effect of flow resistance due to vegetation performed in the new modeling tool WHIMFLO- 2 D is an important contribution to the field of numerical modeling of hydrologic flow in wetlands. ...|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} research, three modeling tools {{have been}} developed to help quantify the complex processes of integrated surface- and ground-water systems in an area under significant agricultural development of Nebraska. To evaluate irrigation effect on stream depletion for the Lower Platte River (LPR) basin, a regional three-dimensional, transient groundwater-flow model is established with MODFLOW. A simplified and more efficient solution has been developed to estimate the stream depletion rate by re-using the flow coefficients of the baseline run. The flow equation is linearized because the head coefficients become constant between solver iterations. The tool has been successfully applied to the LPR model. The results show that the stream depletion analysis tool can reduce the numerical errors produced in the conventional method and improve the computational efficiency. The second modeling tool is a cross-section based streamflow routing (CSR) package for MODFLOW to simulate the streamflow and the interaction between streams and aquifers for the stream with a width larger than the MODFLOW grid size. In the CSR package, streams are divided into stream segments which are formed by two consecutive cross-sections. A rapid algorithm is used to compute the submerged area of the MODFLOW grid. Stream-aquifer seepage is treated as lateral flow in the streamflow routing computation with the Muskingum-Cunge method or mass conservation method. A hypothetical problem was established to test the capabilities of the CSR package with steady- and transient-state models. The third part of this dissertation aims to quantify the impacts of natural processes and human activities on ground-water dynamics in highly agricultural areas by developing an integrated <b>surface-ground</b> water model (ISGWM). In ISGWM, SWAT and MODFLOW are linked by a soil water module (SWM), which is developed based on a non-iterative solution of the 1 D Richards equation. SWM explicitly represents infiltration, soil evaporation, unsaturated water flow, root water update, and lateral drainage. Taking advantage of the simulation capacities of these SWAT, MODFLOW and SWM, ISGWM can simulate the physical hydrologic processes in three domains and their interactions. The model has been successfully applied to the Johnson Creek watershed, which is located within the Lower Platte Basin. ...|$|E

First part of this work studies the effect of surface damage of test wafer by grinding. The other part concentrates at the structural characteristics and purity of epitaxial silicons on the prime or <b>surface-ground</b> wafers, which were prepared by ultrahigh vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHV-CVD). The lattice strain in the surface-damaged layers was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and laser scanning techniques. The undoped epitaxial layers were studied using XRD methods. The process of high temperature (900 ℃) silicon-homoepitaxy was taken in an UHV-CVD reactor,which consists of an ex situ cleaning and an in situ pre-baking. However, low temperature (550 ℃) silicon epitaxial growth was achieved on the hydrogen-passivated silicon-surface without using a high temperature in situ baking. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to investigate the crystalline qualities of the epitaxial layer and the epi-layer/substrate interface prepared at different temperatures and substrates. The secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) was performed to investigate the interfacial concentrations of carbon and oxygen. The results of TEM for the sample prepared at 550 ℃ show the presence of stacking faults, interface, dislocations and rougher surface in the epi-layer. The stacking fault was not observed in the sample polished for three minutes. Nevertheless, all those defects were not observed for the samples prepared by the high temperature process. Chemical purity of the epi-layer was studied using SIMS and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), which indicated lower oxygen and carbon concentrations than those in substrate for the high temperature deposition. For silicon homoepitaxy, the in situ cleaning {{played a major role}} in reducing the amounts of surface contaminants and then the quality of epi-layer. High substrate-temperature is advantageous to the high-quality epitaxial growth. 矽晶片由於它們獨特的性質和豐富的來源，被廣泛的應用於微電子和半導體工業。在本實驗中將研究加工研磨對表面損傷之評估和不同基材及長晶條件對超高真空化學氣相沈積磊晶成長的矽薄膜層之結構性質和純度的影響。 研磨損傷層的晶格應變是利用X-光和雷射掃描的技術來評估，未摻雜矽磊晶層則利用X-光繞射來研究。高溫矽磊晶成長的清潔包括有系統外化學清潔和在腔體的系統內預熱清潔，但是低溫磊晶成長則是只有形成氫鈍化保護的系統外清潔而沒有系統內清潔。實驗中使用穿透式電子顯微鏡來研究不同溫度和基材狀況下成長磊晶層之結晶性及磊晶基材之界面。二次離子質譜儀用來研究界面的碳和氧含量。由TEM觀察發現在 550 ℃成長之磊晶層之試片，表面較不平整且有疊差和界面出現，在研磨拋光較短時間的試片則未觀察到疊差。然而，高溫沈積之磊晶層不但沒有發現額外的缺陷和界面而且表面較平整。在二次離子質譜儀和傅立葉轉換紅外線光譜儀的分析指出高溫成長之磊晶層的碳和氧含量有較基材為低的現象。因此對矽磊晶而言，系統內預熱清潔在減低表面污染上扮演了很重要的角色，而高溫磊晶的優點是可得到高結晶品質的磊晶成長。第一章 緒論 1 1 - 1 前言 1 1 - 2 晶圓製造與磊晶成長技術 2 1 - 3 磊晶缺陷及其來源 3 1 - 4 純度和表面狀態的要求與影響 5 參考文獻及書目 12 第二章 實驗 15 2 - 1 試片來源 15 2 - 2 實驗流程 15 2 - 3 製程前清潔及磊晶試片製作 16 2 - 4 X光Rocking Curve表面應力測量 17 2 - 5 低掠角X光繞射法 18 2 - 6 穿透式電子顯微鏡 20 2 - 7 電子能量損失能譜儀 21 2 - 8 傅立葉轉換紅外線光譜儀 25 參考文獻及書目 36 第三章 結果與討論 39 3 - 1 試片研磨和蝕刻對應力的影響 39 3 - 2 磊晶層應力分析 40 3 - 3 矽磊晶圓結構分析 40 3 - 3 - 1 X光繞射結構分析 40 3 - 3 - 2 TEM影像和繞射圖案結構分析 41 3 - 4 雜質成份分析 42 3 - 4 - 1 FTIR成份分析 42 3 - 4 - 2 EELS成份分析 43 3 - 4 - 3 XPS成份分析 45 3 - 4 - 4 SIMS成份分析 45 3 - 5 不同處理條件基材之磊晶觀察 46 3 - 6 不同處理試片之FTIR比較 48 參考文獻及書目 83 第四章 結論 86 附錄A 87 附錄B 8...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of soil moisture is of pronounced importance in various applications e. g. flood control, agricultural production and effective water resources management. These applications require the {{knowledge of}} spatial and temporal variation of the soil moisture in the watershed. There are three approaches of estimating/measuring soil moisture namely,(i) in-situ measurements,(ii) remote sensing, and(iii) hydrological modelling. The in situ techniques of measurement provide relatively accurate information at point scale but are not feasible to gather in large numbers relevant for a watershed. The soil moisture can be simulated by hydrological models at the desired spatial and temporal resolution, but these simulations would often {{be affected by the}} uncertainties in the model physics, parameters, forcing, initial and boundary conditions. The remote sensing provides an alternative to retrieve the soil moisture of the surface (top few centimeters) layer, but even this data is limited by the spatial or temporal resolution, which is satellite dependant. Hydrological models could be improved by assimilating remotely sensed soil moisture, which requires a retrieval algorithm. In order to develop a retrieval algorithm the satellite data need to be calibrated/validated with the in-situ ground measurements. The retrieval of surface soil moisture from microwave remote sensing is sensitive to surface conditions, and hence requires calibration/validation specific to a site/region. The improvement in the hydrological variables/fluxes is sensitive to the framework adopted during the assimilation of remotely sensed data. The main focus {{of the study was to}} assess the retrieval algorithm for the surface soil moisture from both active (ENVISAT,RADARSAT- 2) and passive(AMSR-E) microwave satellites in a semi-arid tropical watershed of South India. Further, the usefulness of these retrieved remotely sensed products for the estimation of recharge was investigated by developing a coupled hydrological model and an assimilation framework. A brief introduction was made in Chapter 1 on the importance of surface soil moisture and evapotranspiration in hydrology, and the feasible options available for the retrieval from microwave remote sensing. A detailed review of the literature is presented in Chapter 2 to establish the state-of-the-art on the following:(i) retrieval algorithms for the surface soil moisture from active and passive microwave remote sensing,(ii) estimation of actual evapotranspiration from optical remote sensing(MODIS),(iii) coupled <b>surface-ground</b> water hydrological models,(iv) estimation of soil hydraulic properties with their uncertainties, and(v) assimilation framework specific to hydrological modelling. To calibrate/validate the retrieval algorithms and to test the coupled model and the assimilation framework developed, field measurements were carried out in the BerambadI experimental watershed located in the Kabini river basin. The surface soil moisture in 50 field plots, profile soil moisture up to 1 m depth in 20 field plots, and ground water level in 200 bore wells were measured. Twelve images of ENVISAT, seven teen images of RADARSAT- 2, along with AMSR-E and MODIS data were used. These data pertained to different durations during the period 2008 to 2011,the details of which are given in Chapter 3. The approach for the retrieval of surface soil moisture and the associated uncertainty from active and passive microwave remote sensing is given in Chapter 4. Surface soil moisture was retrieved for six vegetation classes using the linear regression model and copulas. Three types of copulas(Clayton, Frank and Gumbel) were investigated. It was found that the ensemble mean simulated using the linear regression model and three copulas was nearly same. The copulas were found to be superior than the linear regression model when comparing the distributions of the mean of the generated ensemble. Among the copulas it was observed that the Clayton copula performed better in the lower and middle ranges of backscatter coefficient, while the Gumbel and Frank copulas were found to be superior in the upper ranges of backscatter coefficients. The range of RMSE was approximatively 4 cm 3 cm− 3 indicating that the retrieval from ENVISAT/RADARSAT- 2 was good. ACDF based approach was proposed to retrieve the surface soil moisture map for the watershed with a spatial resolution of 100 m x 100 m (i. e one hectare). The map of the uncertainty in the retrieved surface soil moisture was also prepared using the Clayton copula. The AMSR-E surface soil moisture product was calibrated for the watershed during the period 2008 to 2011, using the map generated from the ENVISAT/RADARSAT data. They Clayton copula was used to generate the ensemble of the corrected AMSR-E surface soil moisture. The standard deviation of the generated ensemble varied from 0. 01 to 0. 03 cm 3 cm− 3,hence the derived surface soil moisture product for Berambadi was found to be good. In the Chapter 5, a one dimensional soil moisture model was developed based on the numerical solution of the Richards’ equation using finite difference method and inverse modeling was carried out using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation(GLUE) approach for estimating the soil hydraulic parameters of the van Genuchten(VG) model and their uncertainty. The parameters were estimated from the two field sites(Berambadi and Wailapally watershed in South India) and from laboratory evaporation experiment for the Wailapally site. It was found that the GLUE approach was able to provide good uncertainty bounds for the soil hydraulic parameters. The uncertainty in the estimates from the field experiment was found to be higher than from the laboratory evaporation experiment for both water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves. The saturated soil moisture(θs) and shape parameter (n) of VG model estimated from the laboratory evaporation and field experiment were found to be the same, and further more they showed a lower uncertainty from both the experiments. Moreover, the residual soil moisture (θr), inverse of capillary fringe thickness (α) and saturated hydraulic conductivity(KS) showed a relatively higher uncertainty. In the Berambadi watershed,the inverse modeling was performed in three bare field plots, and it was found that ﬁeld plots which had higher θs showed a relatively higher actual evapotranspiration (AET) and lower potential recharge. In Chapter 6, the retrieval of profile soil moisture up to 2 m by assimilation of surface soil moisture was investigated by performing synthetic experiments on six soil types. The measured surface soil moisture over top 5 cm depth was assimilated into the one dimensional soil moisture model to retrieve the profile soil moisture. Even though the assimilation of surface soil moisture helped in improving the profile soil moisture for the six soil types, the bias was observed. To reduce the bias, pseudo observations of profile soil moisture were generated and used in addition to the surface soil moisture in the assimilation altogether. These pseudo observations were generated using the linear relationship existing between the surface and profile soil moisture. A significant bias reduction was found to be feasible by using this method when pseudo observations beyond 75 cm depth were used then there was no significant improvement. A coupled <b>surface-ground</b> water model was developed, which had 5 layers for the vadose zone and one layer for the ground water zone, in order to consider the major hydrological processes from ground surface to ground water table in a semi-arid watershed. The details of the coupled model were described in Chapter 7. The major aim of this model was to be able to use remotely sensed data of surface soil moisture and evapotranspiration to simulate recharge. The model was tested by applying in a lumped framework to the field data set in the Berambadi watershed for the year 2010 to 2011. The performance of the model was evaluated with the measured watershed average root zone soil moisture and ground water levels. The watershed average root zone soil moisture was obtained by averaging the field measurements from 20 plots and average ground water level was obtained by averaging the field measurement from 200 bore wells. In order to assimilate the AET into the coupled model, the daily AET at a spatial resolution of 1 km was estimated from MODIS data. The AET was validated in one forested and four agricultural sites in the watershed. The validation was based on the comparison with AET simulated from water balance models. For agricultural plots the STICS (crop model) and for the forested site the COMFORT (hydrological) model were used. The AET from the MODIS showed a reasonably good match with both the forested and agricultural plots at the annual scale (for the crop model approximately 4 - 5 months). Model simulations were carried out with and without assimilating the remotely sensed data and the performance was evaluated. It was found that the assimilation helped in capturing the trends in deeper layer soil moisture and groundwater level. At the end, in Chapter 8 the major conclusions drawn from the various chapters are summarized...|$|E
