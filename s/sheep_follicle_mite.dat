40|$|Despite their {{continuous}} turnover, <b>sheep</b> antral <b>follicles</b> {{are always}} regularly innervated. The local production of neurotrophins is probably {{involved in the}} control of ovarian innervation. In this context the present investigation was designed to evaluate the ability of <b>sheep</b> antral <b>follicles</b> to produce neurotrophic factors. In {{the first part of}} the paper neurotrophic activity was measured in follicular fluid of <b>sheep</b> antral <b>follicles</b> of different size. Using an in vitro model the effect of gonadotrophins on neurotrophin production was then evaluated. The levels of neurotrophic activity in conditioned medium or follicular fluid and the kind of neurotrophin produced were determined by using the chicken embryo dorsal root ganglia test combined with an immunoneutralization step. Follicular fluid from medium-large follicles (> 4 mm) contains high levels of NGF (240 - 250 ng/ml), whereas the factor is nearly undetectable in small follicles (5 mm up to values of about 60 ng/follicle, whereas follicles with a diameter of less than 3 mm were insensitive to gonadotrophins stimulation and did not produce significant amount of NGF. The data presented demonstrate that <b>sheep</b> <b>follicles</b> produce relevant amounts of NGF as long as the correct hormonal milieu is provided. Under these conditions the production of the NGF increases with increasing follicle size. This may be responsible for the rapid innervation of the wall of growing follicles and/or take part in other non-neural processes that are generally attributed to gonadotrophin stimulation...|$|R

The effect of activin B on androgen production from primary TC cultures in vitro was also assessed. During folliculogenesis, in anestrus and estrus, FF activin B concentrations and thecal and GC activin βB mRNA levels decreased as follicle diameter increased from 1 – 3 to > 6  mm regardless of estrogenic status. Estrogenic preovulatory follicles had reduced concentrations of FF activins B and A, and TC and GCs expressed higher levels of activin βA mRNA at 3 – 4  mm, and TCs more inhibin α mRNA at > 4  mm stages of development compared with nonestrogenic follicles. Activin B decreased androstenedione production from primary TCs in vitro, an effect blocked by inhibin A. Thus, <b>sheep</b> <b>follicles</b> 1 – 3  mm in diameter contained high FF levels of activin B, which decreased as the follicle size increased, and, like activin A, suppressed thecal androgen production in vitro, an effect blocked by inhibin. Furthermore, the theca of large estrogenic follicles expressed high levels of inhibin α and activin βA mRNA suggesting local thecal derived inhibin A production. This would inhibit the negative effects of thecal activins B and A ensuring maximum androgen production for enhanced estradiol production by the preovulatory follicle(s) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{compared}} the in vitro development of <b>sheep</b> preantral <b>follicles</b> obtained from unfrozen or frozen ovarian cortex. After thawing, follicles stored by a slow-freezing protocol with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethylene glycol (EG) were mechanically isolated and cultured for 10 days. After I day, approximately 50 % and 34 % of the DMSO and EG follicles, respectively, showed overt signs of degeneration, as confirmed by histological analysis. Follicles that survived thawing grew and formed antral-like cavities, without significant differences among experimental groups. However, the percentages of healthy oocyte-cumulus cell complexes (OCCs) retrieved from in vitro-grown follicles, as well as estradiol, were lower in DMSO than in EG or unfrozen follicles. Although cryopreservation did not cause appreciable differences in follicle morphological aspects, frozen OCCs showed lower metabolic cooperativity levels, as determined by [H- 3]uridine uptake. During culture, oocytes increased in diameter, but the percentage of germinal vesicle stage-arrested oocytes showing a rimmed chromatin configuration was significantly lower in the frozen groups.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{to the study of}} hair follicle growth is an appropriate assay system. Because equine mane follicles are large and noncurved, enabling easy dissection; are readily accessible from a single defined source; and possess a long anagen growth phase, we initiated a study of them in culture. As in our previous studies of human and <b>sheep</b> <b>follicles</b> (Dev Biol 165 : 469, 1994), we found in this system that transection level dictates the pattern of (follicle growth in vitro: follicles transected below the sebaceous gland show a type I growth pattern (the shaft grows out with an adherent sheath), while nontransected follides show a type 2 growth pattern (a naked shaft grows out lacking a sheath). In the present study, we searched for compounds that might influence type 1 or type 2 patterns of growth. We found that 13 -tisrethaoic acid induced, in a concentration-dependent fashion, a type 1 -like pattern of growth under conditions for which a type 2 pattern was expected. All-trans-retinoic acid, SR 11237 (a synthetic retinoid X receptor-specific ligand), and meta-carboxy-TTNPB (an inactive synthetic retinold) did not have these properties. We hypothesize that sheath growth/processing is mediated by the follicle {{at the level of the}} sebaceous gland, or by the sebaceous gland itself, and that persistence of the follicle sheath about the outgrowing shaft in vitro (i) in the physical absence of the sebaceous portion of the follicle, or (ii) in the presence of 13 -cis-retinoic acid, is due to the reduced expression of a factor that regulates important shaft-sheath interactions...|$|R

Each ovarian pair from five mixed-breed ewes was divided into 17 fragments. One (control) fragment was immediately fixed for routine histological and ultrastructural studies and the remaining (test) fragments were randomly distributed in cryotubes, equilibrated at 20 °C/ 20 min in 1. 8 mL of minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 1. 5 or 3 M GLY, EG, PROH or DMSO and then either fixed for morphological studies to determine their possible toxic effect or frozen/thawed and then fixed to test the effect of cryopreservation on preantral follicles. Histological analysis showed that, compared to control fragments, all cryoprotectants at both concentrations significantly reduced the percentage of normal preantral follicles in ovarian fragments prior to or after cryopreservation. PROH 3. 0 M appeared to exert a more toxic effect (P < 0. 05) than the other cryoprotectants in noncryopreserved tissues. After freezing/thawing, the highest (P < 0. 05) percentages of lightmicroscopical normal preantral follicles were observed in ovarian fragments cryopreserved in EG (1. 5 and 3 M) or DMSO (1. 5 M). However, transmission electronic microscopical (TEM) examination showed that only the DMSO-cryopreserved preantral follicles had normal ultrastructure.

The other 24 fragments were randomly distributed in tubes containing 2 ml of 0. 9 % saline solution or TCM 199 and maintained at 4, 20 or 39 °C for 2, 4, 12, or 24 h. Based on histological assessment, storage of ovarian fragments in 0. 9 % saline solution at 20 °C for up to 24 h and in both solutions at 39 °C for 4, 12 or 24 h increased (P< 0. 01) the percentage of degenerate primordial follicles compared with controls. In contrast, preservation at 4 °C in both solutions, kept the percentage of morphologically normal primordial follicles similar to control values. Although histological integrity of primordial follicles was maintained in fragments stored at 20 °C for up to 24 h in TCM 199, these results were not confirmed by ultrastructural analysis.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of plasma PRL concentration in regulating seasonal fibre growth following the transition from short to long day photoperiod. In three down goat genotypes higher proportions of Angora genes extended the duration of guard hair growth, decreased biannual down growth and reduced the period of secondary follicles inactivity. The timing of follicle reactivation in spring and seasonal changes in plasma PRL concentrations were similar in all genotypes. Plasma PRL concentration increase, in spring, was associated with primary, but not secondary, follicle reactivation. Secondary follicle reactivation produced down of less than 2 mm which {{was associated with the}} shedding of winter down. Plasma PRL concentrations were suppressed, in spring and long-photoperiods (16 L: 8 D), by injections of 1 - 5 mg/goat/day of bromocryptine and 2 - 3 weekly injections of long-acting bromocryptine (Parlodel). Injections of 1 - 5 mg/goat/day of domperidone elevated plasma PRL concentrations for 12 hours by and shedding was advanced. The circulating half-life of PRL, in sheep and goats, was 42 ± 6 and 104 ± 14 minutes following PRL injection or constant infusion respectively. In down goats, the normal spring-rise in plasma PRL concentration was suppressed using Parlodel or advanced by long day photoperiod. Increased plasma PRL concentration in spring provided anagenic signals to telogen primary and secondary follicles and catagenic signals to anagen secondary follicles. Following a reversal from short to long photoperiod anagen follicles of both goats and sheep entered telogen. Shedding occurred when the follicles subsequently reactivated. The suppression of plasma PRL concentration using Parlodel, during long photoperiod reversal, prevented the catagenic effect of long-photoperiod on anagen Wiltshire <b>sheep</b> <b>follicles.</b> In goats, however bromocryptine did not prevent follicles entering catagen but delayed follicle reactivation.

40|$|PREANTRAL follicles {{represent}} 90 {{per cent}} of the follicular population of mammalian ovaries (Roy and Treacy 1993). However, the vast majority (99. 9 per cent) become atretic during their growth and maturation in vivo (Carroll and others 1990). The maintenance of follicular quality in vitro by appropriate handling of the ovaries during their collection and transportation is important for providing healthy oocytes for cryopreservation and/or in vitro culture, as ovarian donors are frequently some distance from specialised laboratories. Several studies have successfully used saline solution to preserve bovine (Schernthaner and others 1997) and caprine (Lucci and others 1999) ovaries {{for a period of}} a few hours. Tissue culture medium 199 (TCMl 99; Sigma) has also been used successfully in the transport of bovine ovaries (Figueiredo and others 1993) and bovine oocytes from antral follicles (Twagiramungu and others 1998). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of 0 9 per cent saline solution or TCM 199 on the short-term preservation of <b>sheep</b> preantral <b>follicles</b> inside ovarian tissue, at different temperatures and over different periods of storage...|$|R
40|$|Ovarian follicles {{are a major}} site of {{oestrogen}} synthesis in sheep, {{but almost}} nothing {{is known about the}} relative contribution made by follicles of different sizes to the output of oestrogen at various stages of the reproductive cycle. To determine this, ovaries were dissected from <b>sheep,</b> all <b>follicles</b> over 2 mm in diameter were explanted separately as organ cultures and the daily produc-tion of oestrogen from each follicle was measured. This study was preceded by a series of preliminary experiments undertaken to define suitable conditions in which ovarian follicles would retain both their morphological integrity and steroidogenic capacity in culture. The 224 follicles used in the preliminary series of experiments were explanted from the ovaries of seventeen sheep killed between the 2 nd and 15 th days of the oestrous cycle. A total of 218 follicles was used in the main experiment: 186 follicles were obtained from seventeen sheep during the oestrous cycle, seventeen <b>follicles</b> from two <b>sheep</b> at mid-pregnancy and fifteen <b>follicles</b> from two <b>sheep</b> during the anoestrous period. The follicles were dissected free o...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs, are {{involved}} in many aspects of biological processes. Previous {{studies have indicated that}} miRNAs are important for hair follicle development and growth. In our study, we found by qRT-PCR that miR- 148 b was significantly upregulated in <b>sheep</b> wool <b>follicle</b> bulbs in anagen phase compared with the telogen phase of the hair follicle cycle. Overexpression of miR- 148 b promoted proliferation of both HHDPC and HHGMC. By using the TOPFlash system we demonstrated that miR- 148 b could activate Wnt/β-catenin pathway and b-catenin, cycD, c-jun and PPARD were consistently upregulated accordingly. Furthermore, transcript factor nuclear factor of activated T cells type 5 (NFAT 5) and Wnt 10 b were predicted to be the target of miR- 148 b and this was substantiated using a Dual-Luciferase reporter system. Subsequently NFAT 5 was further identified as the target of miR- 148 b using western blotting. These results were considered to indicate that miR- 148 b could activate the Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway by targeting NFAT 5 to promote the proliferation of human hair follicle cells...|$|R
