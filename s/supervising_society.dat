50|$|This {{situation}} in Victoria {{was a little}} unusual. When runs of withdrawals had threatened building societies in the 1970s they got together to form an Australia-wide National Deposit Insurance Corporation to protect depositors, with standby credit and minimum prudential ratios for member societies to observe. The Victorian government of the time had chosen {{not to participate in}} that scheme, believing the government could regulate and <b>supervise</b> <b>societies.</b>|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the father-metaphor, gerontocratic power, democratization and religion in the context of changing political culture in Malawi. It argues that democratization in Malawi signalled a change {{in the nature of the}} dominant gerontocratic power relations associated with Chewa political traditions, and gave the young an opportunity to escape from their tightly circumscribed sociopolitical space in what for thirty years had been a highly <b>supervised</b> <b>society.</b> It further argues that religion, in particular 'born-again' (often Pentecostal) Christianity, played a significant role in changing the meaning of the crucial root paradigm of gerontocracy in Malawian political culture. The chapter shows that the position adopted by religious youth groups in the 1990 s was the outcome of a 'struggle for youth' that Malawian society had faced since colonial times and in which religion played a significant role. In so doing, it deconstructs the so-called 'conservative nature' of Christian fundamentalism-cum- Pentecostalis...|$|R
40|$|The {{unprecedented}} rise in {{the number}} of people held in U. S. jails and prisons has garnered considerable attention from policy makers, activists, and academics alike. Signaled in part by Michelle Alexander’s New York Times bestseller, The New Jim Crow, and the unlikely coalition of activists, policy makers, celebrities, and business leaders on both sides of the political aisle who have pledged to end mass incarceration in our lifetime, the prison system has returned to public policy discourse in a way that was unforeseen less than a decade ago. On any given day in 2014, just over 2. 3 million people were held in U. S. jails and prisons. 1 This figure represents a tenfold increase in the inmate census since 1973, and about 22 percent of the world’s prisoner population. 2 Unfortunately, while the causes and consequences of mass incarceration warrant rigorous examination, the focus on arrest and imprisonment has left a curious, yet equally historic phenomenon hidden in plain sight—the rise of a <b>supervised</b> <b>society,</b> and with it, an alternate track of citizenship...|$|R
50|$|This chapter {{highlights}} the old regimes in crisis, such as France, China, and Russia. These states set the precedent for old regimes in crisis {{and help to}} outline pre-revolutionary conditions and the leading causes. Skocpol’s states that revolutionary crisis are created when the old regimes fail to modernize with the evolving international situation (Skocpol 1979, 48). The reason that the old regimes were in crisis was because the upper classes could not defend against peasant rebellions on a local basis; therefore, they <b>supervise</b> <b>society</b> to maintain order (Skocpol 1979, 48). The landed upper class relied on the monarchical class to bolster their status, prerogatives, and they built their fortune on state services to have such opportunities (Skocpol 1979, 49). Thus, the economic interests of the landed upper classes were in part obstacles to be overcome. These states were caught in a tough situation where the state decided to update their status {{in the international arena}} or fix the domestic class structure among {{the rich and the poor}} (Skocpol 1979, 50).|$|R
50|$|In 1906, a {{house was}} {{purchased}} by the Board of Directors on Avenue H {{in the city of}} Fort Worth. The purpose was to house children until they could be placed with a permanent family. Reverend Morris was the State Superintendent, fundraiser and Chairman of the Board of Directors until his death in 1914. Reverend Morris was responsible for finding homes for some 1000 children. Isabella (“Belle”) succeeded him and <b>supervised</b> the <b>Society</b> until 1924.|$|R

Anywhere from two to four itinerant preachers would be assigned to a circuit on a yearly basis to preach and <b>supervise</b> the <b>societies</b> within their circuit. One itinerant preacher in each circuit would be made the [...] "assistant" [...] (because he was an assistant to Wesley), and he would direct {{the activities of the}} other itinerant preachers in the circuit, who were called [...] "helpers". Wesley gave out preaching assignments at an annual conference.|$|R

40|$|Using Foucault's (1977, 1978) {{notion of}} panoptic method of governmentality {{and looking at}} the case of Singapore's Internet policy, this paper {{attempts}} to expand on the idea-and ideals-of 'auto-regulation'(Lee, 2000, pp. 4 - 5; Lee & Birch, 2000). Auto-regulation, as I shall posit in this paper, provides a way for regulatory enforcement and surveillance to become sufficiently transparent and 'normalised' so that 'the exercise of power may be <b>supervised</b> by <b>society</b> as a whole'(Foucault, 1977, pp. 207 - 208) rather than by a select group of policy and law enforcement officers, or civil society /activist groups...|$|R

The Federal Bureau of Prisons website also confirmed Lanier's date of discharge conditional to the requirement that he spends a six-month duration in a halfway house before entering a three-year-long <b>supervised</b> release into <b>society</b> where will be disallowed alcohol and/or firearms. Lanier stated that he had a job awaiting him at a classic car museum in Florida, said to be for Preston Henn, owner of Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop.|$|R
40|$|There is {{mounting}} evidence that prison inmates benefit from educational opportunities {{but may not}} be offered to them. In addition, when they are offered, priority is given to prisoners who will be released in the near future, and those serving long-term or life sentences {{are less likely to}} have access to classes. A service learning opportunity was created where students taught a life span development class to women serving long-term sentences. This article provides a guide to setting up the class while avoiding obstacles along the way. It also outlines benefits to students, inmates, <b>supervising</b> faculty, and <b>society.</b> In order to teach, students must apply what they have learned, and the prison experience challenges them to consider their power and privilege...|$|R
500|$|Hermes o Logios was {{established}} {{with the support}} of the Philological Society in Bucharest, an organization consisting of Greek intellectuals headed by the local Greek Orthodox Bishop, Ignatios II. The Society’s goals, as published in the first issue of the periodical, were [...] "the awakening to the progress of learning" [...] and [...] "the cultivation of the newer Greek language". Apart from Hermes o Logios, the <b>Society</b> <b>supervised</b> also a Greek-language school, financed translations of schoolbooks into modern Greek and provided scholarships for students to study abroad. Ignatios has already stated the need for a philological newspaper, in which each man of learning could publish his ideas, adding that [...] "This is what the wise man Korais advises us to do and he has wisely chosen a worthy man, archimandrite Anthimos Gazis". The members of the Society then all agreed to cover part of the printing expenses.|$|R
25|$|The {{site has}} been studied {{extensively}} since 1874, with the first excavations beginning in 1875, when the Portuguese archaeologist Francisco Martins Sarmento began annual excavation campaigns while helping to develop methods of archaeological research and preservation in Portugal. Sarmento's campaigns led {{to the discovery of}} much of the ruins of the acropolis (the highest portion of the settlement), and he reconstructed a pair of dwellings on the site from his research. Continuing discoveries during the first decades of work led Martins Sarmento to purchase the land on which the settlement lay, which was regularly continued by the Sociedade Martins Sarmento. The land and Martins Sarmento's research materials were bequeathed to the Society. From the 1930s through the 1960s, new excavations were carried out by the <b>Society,</b> <b>supervised</b> by Mário Cardozo, which led to the discovery of large parts of the settlement on the eastern slope and additional portions of the acropolis. Further surveys were made in the 1970s (in the north-eastern section), and in 2002, 2005 and 2006.|$|R

In 1962 he was made the head of the Ramakrishna Mission center in New Delhi, an important centre of the Ramakrishna Order. He came to the United States on 5 August 1968, to be the Assistant Minister of the San Francisco Vedanta Society, where he served for two years; later he was appointed head of the Vedanta Society of Berkeley, California, where he stayed for six years. In December 1976, after the death of spiritual leader and author Swami Prabhavananda, he was transferred to Hollywood, the headquarters of the Vedanta Society of Southern California, where he remained the minister until his death. He also <b>supervised</b> the Vedanta <b>Society</b> of Greater Washington, DC, since 1997, and Vivekananda Retreat, Ridgely, since 1998.In the late 1980s, he lectured and gave spiritual guidance in Moscow. As a spiritual leader, Swahananda encouraged westerners to take leadership roles in the Vedanta movement.|$|R
5000|$|National Efficiency was {{an attempt}} to {{discredit}} the old-fashioned habits, customs and institutions that put the British at a handicap in competition with the world, especially with Germany, which was seen as the epitome of efficiency. In the early 20th century, [...] "National Efficiency" [...] became a powerful demand — a movement supported by prominent figures across the political spectrum who disparaged sentimental humanitarianism and identified waste and model as witnesses a mistake that could no longer be tolerated. The movement took place in two waves; the first wave from 1899 to 1905 was made urgent by the inefficiencies and failures in the Second Boer War (1899-1902). Spectator magazine reported in 1902 there was [...] "a universal outcry for efficiency in all departments of society, in all aspects of life". [...] The two most important themes were technocratic efficiency and managerial efficiency. As White (1899) argued vigorously, the empire needed to be put on a business footing and administered to get better results. The looming threat of Germany, which was widely seen as a much more efficient nation, added urgency after 1902. Politically National Efficiency brought together modernizing Conservatives and Unionists, Liberals who wanted to bring modernize their party, and Fabians such as George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, along with Beatrice and Sidney Webb, who had outgrown socialism and saw the utopia of a scientifically up-to-date <b>society</b> <b>supervised</b> by experts such as themselves. Churchill in 1908 formed an alliance with the Webbs, announcing the goal of a [...] "National Minimum", covering hours, working conditions, and wages - it was a safety net below which the individual {{would not be allowed to}} fall.|$|R
