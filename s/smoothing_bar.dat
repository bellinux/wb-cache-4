This issue has been addressed in several research projects with, however, a strong focus on ribbed bars, while further knowledge about <b>smooth</b> <b>bars</b> is still needed.

40|$|Currently, {{the seismic}} {{assessment}} of old reinforced concrete (RC) {{construction in the}} case of the internal reinforcement of <b>smooth</b> <b>bars,</b> as well as the decision regarding convenient rehabilitation strategies, are of major interest throughout the seismically active areas of the world. The lateral response evaluation of old type RC columns that have <b>smooth</b> (plain) <b>bars</b> is the focus of this study. The results of three monotonic tests on columns, which have been performed under two different experimental setups in two different university laboratories, are presented. Through analysis of test observations and experimental results, this paper aims at investigating the lateral behavioral aspects of RC columns with <b>smooth</b> <b>bars.</b> A new formulation is derived for predicting base shear strength in RC columns with <b>smooth</b> <b>bars,</b> considering quasirocking mode of deflections imposed by high levels of base rotations; furthermore, a new macro model for predicting the related lateral force-deflection response is consequently proposed. Finally, the macro model results are compared with the results of two types of fiber element methods. The macro model allows for prediction of the main characteristics of the response as well as simulating a real internal shear resistance mechanism accompanied with the formation of a compression strut inside the column body as a consequence of a quasi-rocking mode of deflections...|$|R
40|$|Current code {{prescriptions}} {{allow to}} evaluate the ultimate rotational capacity from hybrid (mechanical-empirical) or empirical formulations, for reinforced concrete (RC) members with ribbed bars and seismically detailed. These formulations can be extended to non-conforming elements, including members with <b>smooth</b> <b>bars,</b> by means of correction coefficients calibrated on experimental data. These coefficients imply {{a reduction in the}} deformation capacity, which increases if lapping of longitudinal bars is present. The reliability of empirically calibrated coefficients directly depends on the extension of the experimental database, that is, on the number of available tests. The experimental campaign carried out at the University of Naples on 16 real-scale columns with <b>smooth</b> <b>bars</b> allows to extend the experimental database for this typology. Experimental results highlight that rotational capacity of columns with <b>smooth</b> <b>bars</b> is rather large, even higher than the capacity of similar columns reinforced with ribbed bars. This is basically due to the increase in deformability caused by the fixed-end rotation mechanism, particularly exalted when bond capacities are low. Therefore, also based on these results, new correction coefficients are proposed...|$|R

This paper deals with a comprehensive experimental campaign investigating the compressive behaviour of <b>smooth</b> <b>bars</b> for different values of the ratio L/D, L being the restraints distance and D the bar diameter. The stress-strain relationship is then modelled ranging from an elastic-plastic behaviour identical to that in tension (L/D = 5) to the elastic buckling behaviour (L/D > 20).

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of an experimental campaign on the cyclic behavior of <b>smooth</b> steel <b>bars,</b> used as internal reinforcement of existing Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures; the stress-strain relationship is analyzed for different values of L/D ratio, where L is the stirrup spacing and D is the longitudinal bar diameter. Most of the experimental tests concerned <b>smooth</b> <b>bars</b> with L/D ratios ranging between 5 and 100. The analysis of the test results is complemented by some comparisons of the curves obtained by experimental tests on <b>smooth</b> steel <b>bars</b> with those obtained by experimental tests on ribbed steel bars. The theoretical predictions obtained by existing models available in the literature on the cyclic behavior of ribbed steel bars are then discussed.

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>smooth</b> (plain) <b>bars</b> in reinforced concrete (RC) construction has been abandoned since the 1970 s; however, {{there are many}} old reinforced concrete buildings in the world whose construction is based on this old style that are now in need of structural seismic rehabilitation {{according to the requirements}} of present day seismic rehabilitation codes. The focus of this study concerns the investigation of the hysteretic cyclic response of RC columns with <b>smooth</b> <b>bars.</b> The results of six column specimens having a variety of details for overlapping splices of longitudinal bars while experiencing two different levels of axial loads under cyclic loading reversals are presented. Through analysis of test observations and the obtained experimental results, it is attempted to clarify major aspects of hysteretic response for RC columns with <b>smooth</b> <b>bars,</b> from a seismic assessment point of view. The hysteretic force-drift responses of columns are deeply investigated and a new concept explaining the flag shape form of the hysteretic response is presented. Furthermore, the rocking response of columns is predicted with a new formulation that assumes an internal compression strut inside the column body as a consequence of rocking that originated from high base rotations. Finally, a simple hysteresis rule is proposed which is the result of considering the combination of two springs in parallel to provide the total hysteretic response as the summation of rocking hysteretic and bottom anchor (<b>smooth</b> <b>bar)</b> hysteretic responses...|$|R

40|$|Size {{effect is}} {{unanimously}} {{recognized as a}} peculiar – and critical – aspect of the mechanical behavior of many structures, provided that either their material or the interfaces among their parts have a quasi-brittle behavior. In this paper, the results obtained during two experimental campaigns carried out at Politecnico di Milano on long <b>smooth</b> <b>bars</b> and on short deformed bars are recalled. In both cases size effect is shown to be very strong and in good agreement with the well-known size-effect power law proposed by Bažant and coworkers. Size effect is also modeled by numerically solving the 2 nd-order bond equation in one dimension. In the case of <b>smooth</b> <b>bars,</b> a simple but effective approach is adopted, by assuming for the interface an elastic-frictional behavior.

Over the fatigue life range from about 300 to 3000 cycles the ratio of fatigue life for <b>smooth</b> <b>bar</b> to fatigue life for notched bar remained constant at a value of about 6. 0. Some additional hold-time data for the R- 2 alloy tested in argon at 538 C are reported. An analysis of the relaxation data obtained in these hold-time tests is also reported and it is shown that these data yield a fairly consistent correlation in terms of instantaneous stress rate divided by instantaneous stress. Two thermal-mechanical strain cycling tests were also performed using a cyclic frequency of 4. 5 cycles per hour and a temperature cycling interval from 260 to 538 C.

This was followed by notch fatigue testing (Kt= 2) run under load control. Analysis of the fatigue data using a Smith-Watson-Topper approach and finite element analysis of the notch root was employed to understand material behavior in these tests. <b>Smooth</b> <b>bar</b> fatigue data showed a significant R-ratio dependence at either test temperature which could be accounted for using a Smith-Watson-Topper parameter (SWT). In general, fatigue life was longer at 750 F than 1300 F for a given SWT. For notch fatigue tests, life was longer at 750 F than 1300 F but only at higher stresses. This was attributed to differences in alloy strength. At lower stresses, finite element analysis suggested that convergence of fatigue life at both temperatures resulted from relaxation of stresses at the notch root in the 1300 F tests...|$|R

40|$|The fatigue {{behavior}} of a 3 rd generation PM disk alloy, LSHR, was studied at 1300 F. Tensile, creep, and fatigue tests were run on smooth and notched (Kt = 2) bars {{under a variety of}} conditions. Analysis of <b>smooth</b> <b>bar</b> fatigue data, run under strain and load control with R ratios of 0 and - 1, showed that a stress based Smith-Watson-Topper approach could collapse the data set. While the tensile and creep data showed substantial notch strengthening at 1300 F, the fatigue data showed a life deficit for the notch specimens. A viscoplastic finite element model, which accounted for stress relaxation at the notch tip, provided the best correlation between the notched and <b>smooth</b> <b>bar</b> behavior, although the fatigue data was not fully rationalized based on this simplified viscoplastic model of the stresses at the notch tip.

Experimental tests on six 2 / 3 scaled beam-column subassemblies, with structural deficiencies typical of Italian construction practice between the 50 ’s and 70 ’s, were performed under simulated seismic loads.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{illustrates}} {{the results of}} experimental tests performed on sub-assemblages of R/C (Reinforced Concrete) existing structures, designed only for gravity loads In order to estimate failure mechanisms and ductility properties, four internal and external R/C beam-column joints were built and tested.

The tests were performed by increasing cyclic horizontal displacements up to the collapse. The experimental results show that seismic response of these kind of structures is mainly influenced by bond slips of longitudinal bars, and that the shear collapse regards external joints rather the internal ones. Failure mechanisms observed (column plastic hingings for internal joints, shear failure for external joints) point out the vulnerability of these structures due to the soft storey mechanism.
