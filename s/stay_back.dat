5|$|Gestation lasts six {{to seven}} months. Births {{generally}} occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover {{for the first few}} weeks of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, forced out of the group, join bachelor herds, while females may <b>stay</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
5|$|Active mainly {{during the}} day, the impala may be gregarious or {{territorial}} {{depending upon the}} climate and geography. Three distinct social groups can be observed: the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The impala is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti-predator strategy. Browsers as well as grazers, impala feed on monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). An annual, three-week-long rut takes place {{toward the end of}} the wet season, typically in May. Rutting males fight over dominance, and the victorious male courts female in oestrus. Gestation lasts six to seven months, following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males—forced out of the all-female groups—join bachelor herds, while females may <b>stay</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

5|$|After his training, Rane {{was posted}} to the 28th Field Company, an {{engineering}} {{unit of the}} 26th Infantry Division which, at the time, was fighting the Japanese in Burma. As his division retreated from the Japanese after the failed Arakan Campaign, he, along with his two sections, was hand-picked by his company commander to <b>stay</b> <b>back</b> behind at Buthidaung to destroy key assets and then be evacuated by the Royal Indian Navy. Though the objective was soon achieved, the expected pickup did not happen. This forced Rane and his men to cross a river that was patrolled by the Japanese to reach their lines. Rane, along with his two sections, expertly evaded the Japanese troops, and joined the 26th Infantry Division at Bahri. For his actions, {{he was promoted to}} havaldar (sergeant).|$|E
5|$|Males, {{females and}} juveniles each form {{separate}} social groups. The male groups are the smallest; the members stay together {{and search for}} food or water sources. The female group is much larger and covers greater areas. They travel the grassy plains in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods. Females have a complex linear hierarchy. The nursery and juvenile group is naturally formed when females give birth to calves. After about 24 hours of the delivery, the mother and calf join this group. The calves start befriending each other and <b>stay</b> <b>back</b> in the nursery group while the mother returns to the female group. The calves leave the nursery group when they {{are at least two}} years old and join a male or female group.|$|E
5|$|The {{offspring}} may {{stay with}} the mother for 13 to 20 months, associating {{with one another and}} feeding on kills together. After weaning, juveniles may form mixed-sex herds; young females may <b>stay</b> <b>back</b> with their mother, but there is hardly any interaction between the mother and daughters. The females in the mixed-sex herd gradually move out as they near sexual maturity. In the Serengeti, average age of independence of 70 observed litters was 17.1 months. Young females had their first litters at the age of about 2.4 years and subsequent litters about 20 months later. The lifespan of wild cheetahs is 14 to 15 years for females; their reproductive cycle typically ends by 12 years of age. Males generally live as long as 10 years.|$|E

5|$|Vincent begins {{creating}} {{the painting of}} the church and soon spots the beast inside. The Doctor demands that Amy <b>stay</b> <b>back</b> as he enters the church alone, but she and Vincent both agree they should help the Doctor. Vincent is able to save the Doctor and Amy, describing the beast's actions as they hide in the confessionals. The Doctor soon realises from Vincent's description that the beast is blind, the likely reason it was abandoned on Earth, and is frightened of its surroundings. The beast is impaled on Vincent's easel when it tries to lunge at the artist. The Doctor attempts to soothe the dying creature while Vincent empathises with its pain. After the creature dies, the three return outside the church and Vincent describes the night sky as he envisions it.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{nearly two}} to three months, {{following}} which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born. Births generally peak from October to February. Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvark and porcupines. Kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and the claws non-retractable (unable to be drawn inside); the coat resembles that of adults, but the abdomen is spotted. Eyes open by ten days, but it takes longer for the vision to become normal. The ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week. Around {{the same time the}} kittens start roaming their birthplace, and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week. They begin taking solid food around the same time; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill. As the kittens start moving about by themselves, the mother starts shifting them everyday. All the milk teeth appear in 50 days, and permanent dentition is completed in 10 months. Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months, though a few females <b>stay</b> <b>back</b> with their mothers. The average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years.|$|E

25|$|For {{the third}} {{consecutive}} year, the arrival dates for the teams were staggered, with the Patriots arriving on Sunday, January 27 (corresponding to the traditional day that teams arrive for the game with the two-week break) and the Giants waiting to arrive until Monday, January 28. A report filed by ESPN's Rachel Nichols suggested that the Giants stayed to practice more of their game plan in their home facility before arriving at the Super Bowl. By electing to <b>stay</b> <b>back</b> at home the Giants chose to follow a tactic that the previous two Super Bowl champions, the Indianapolis Colts (before Super Bowl XLI) and the Pittsburgh Steelers (before Super Bowl XL), had employed.|$|E

25|$|Typically, {{strategy}} is limited for casual walk-on style paintball play. Some teamwork {{will be seen}} {{at the beginning of}} the games with brief discussions on tactics and strategy, such as distributing players between bunkers and assigning defenders that will <b>stay</b> <b>back</b> and cover attackers that advance. However, mid to late game tactics tend to be limited to groups of players sticking together or doing isolated attacks rather than a coordinated sweep down the field. In team paintball tournaments, more serious planned team tactics and {{strategy is}} seen throughout each game from the opening to the endgame. Teams generally practice together and have planned tactics they can use in the tournament, and know what each of their teammates will be trying to do in various situations during the game.|$|E

25|$|During his lifetime, Vallabhbhai Patel {{received}} {{criticism for}} an alleged bias against Muslims {{during the time}} of Partition. He was criticised by Maulana Azad and others for readily plumping for partition. Guha says that, during the Partition, Nehru wanted the government to make the Muslims <b>stay</b> <b>back</b> and feel secure in India while Patel was inclined to place that responsibility on the individuals themselves. Patel also told Nehru that the minority also had to remove the doubts that were entertained about their loyalty based on their past association with the demand of Pakistan. However, Patel successfully prevented attacks upon a train of Muslim refugees leaving India. In September 1947 he was said to have had ten thousand Muslims sheltered safely in the Red Fort and had free kitchens opened for them during the communal violence. Patel was also said to be more forgiving of Indian nationalism and harsher on Pakistan. He exposed a riot plot, confiscated a large haul of weapons from the Delhi Jumma Masjid, and had a few plotters killed by the police, but his approach was said to have been harsh.|$|E
