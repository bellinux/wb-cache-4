It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

500|$|With {{the fall}} of Sihanouk, Hanoi became alarmed at the {{prospect}} of a pro-Western regime that might allow the Americans to establish a military presence on their western flank. To prevent that from happening, they began transferring their military installations away from the border regions to locations deeper within Cambodian territory. A new command center was established at the city of Kratié and the timing of the move was propitious. President Nixon was of the opinion that: [...] "We need a bold move in Cambodia to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> stand with Lon Nol...something symbolic...for the only Cambodian regime that had the guts to take a pro-Western and pro-American stand." ...|$|E

Inspiration came from the 1982 American experimental film, Koyaanisqatsi, which showed time-lapse footage of cities. Madonna's scenes were shot in early April 1998 at MTV's Times Square studios in New York and Los Angeles. Background scenes were shot in various cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London, Las Vegas, and Stockholm. Test shots taken in Stockholm were presented to Madonna, for conveying the idea behind the clip, but they were deemed good to be used in the final product.|$|E

Hungry for Stink peaked at No. 172 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and coincided with the 1994 Lollapalooza music festival, where the band shared the stage with other successful acts including The Smashing Pumpkins and The Breeders. For their next album, L7 {{decided to take a}} less constrained approach than they took with their previous albums. According to singer and guitarist Donita Sparks, [...] "In the past, I think we wanted to prove that we were tough cookies.

[...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E
500|$|The {{fourth season}} explores {{the concept of}} Life Model Decoys (LMDs), which were first {{referenced}} in The Avengers, and introduces the character Ghost Rider to the MCU. On why the series waited to begin exploring LMDs, Jed Whedon said that the series previously {{did not want to}} explore the concept before the release of Avengers: Age of Ultron, which sees the introductions of Ultron and Vision in a similar manner to LMDs. On introducing Ghost Rider, Whedon said that [...] "with Doctor Strange coming out this year, the Marvel [...] Universe is moving into new waters," [...] referring to the exploration of magic. [...] "We felt that this was obviously a great character that we'd love to have on our <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> feel fits with that shift." [...] The season also continues storylines from the second season of Agent Carter, with the reveal that the Momentum Energy Labs group is a successor to the Isodyne Energy company, with both companies connected by the parent company Roxxon, a mainstay of the MCU. In August 2017, Emily VanCamp said that discussions had taken place for her to reprise her role of Sharon Carter for the series, but there were conflicts with her starring role on the series Revenge.|$|E

500|$|The season's {{exploring}} of supernatural {{and mystical}} concepts ties-in {{with the release}} of Doctor Strange, the first MCU film to explore magic. In addition to the Darkhold, this includes the introduction of Ghost Rider, with Whedon explaining in July 2016, that [...] "the Marvel [...] Universe is moving into new waters [...] We felt that [...] was obviously a great character that we’d love to have on our <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> feel fits with that shift." [...] Whedon pointed out that the previous tie-ins were sometimes [...] "very direct", and other times [...] "more thematic. The tie this year will feel more of a reflection of , less an interweaving plot." [...] He added, [...] "Hopefully some of the questions that we’re asking will be answered by [...] then pose some new themes and ideas for us to explore." [...] "Deals with Our Devils", aired after the release of Doctor Strange, sees Aida create a portal to rescue Coulson and Fitz from another dimension. The visuals for these are intentionally reminiscent of those used in the film. Bell added that the Darkhold [...] "feels like it belongs in the library in Kathmandu", referring to the Kamar-Taj library seen in Doctor Strange.|$|E
500|$|On 31 August 2012, Jesy Nelson told Jenn Selby of Glamour that Little Mix's third single will be {{completely}} different from their previous two, {{and that it will}} show a different side to the group that has never been seen before. Leigh-Anne Pinnock went on to reveal to Selby that the song will serve as the album's second single, in turn resulting in the group's debut single [...] "Cannonball" [...] not featuring on the album altogether. Pinnock added that the second single was a pending choice between two songs at that time, and that the group were leaning towards the [...] "darker" [...] and [...] "different" [...] track. Speaking to Selby, Pinnock reasoned the group's choice: [...] "It's just a chance for us to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can be really serious and really show off our vocals well. This one's really about the vocals." [...] On 11 September 2012, details of the song and its title were revealed when music industry insiders were played a preview of [...] "DNA" [...] during the Sony Music Entertainment Conference Day. [...] Following the conference, Chart Show TV described the song as an [...] "electro ballad" [...] on Twitter. Before promptly deleting the tweet, they added that the song is [...] "very cool" [...] and has [...] "big vocals". On 27 September 2012, [...] announced that [...] "DNA" [...] will be sent to radio in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2012. The song then leaked onto the internet on 28 September 2012, two days before its radio premiere.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{has stated}} that he [...] "does not know enough" [...] to say whether he approves of the {{legislation}} of medicinal marijuana, but none of The Simpsons writers use the drug. [...] "It's {{one of the most}} sober writing staffs I've ever encountered", staff writer Max Pross said in the episode's DVD commentary. When asked about what stance the episode holds regarding the legislation of medicinal marijuana, Jean said that series' staff wanted to explore both sides of the issue, rather than making an absolute statement. He added that the episode is rather a critique of legislations that are immediately criminalized after they are legitimized. [...] "The stance is that it seems ridiculous to legalize something and then criminalize it, which I have seen happen in various states", Jean said. He continued, [...] "It's just weird to take away a right or to grant people a liberty and then abandon it. I would say that's the strongest statement [...] makes." [...] The episode also criticizes the use of genetically modified foods. At the beginning of the episode, Marge announces that the family's dinner includes genetically modified vegetables, to which Lisa replies [...] "American corporations should stop playing god with nature." [...] She then notices that her potato starts eating her carrot. Even though the episode portrays genetic modifications in a negative light, none of The Simpsons writers were actually against the technique. After the scene was written, Reiss asked all the writers if they were against genetic modifications of food, and none of them were. [...] "Very often we take these stands on the <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do not believe in at all", Reiss explained in the DVD commentary for the episode. The scene was originally three times longer, and was conceived during a rewrite session with the staff writers.|$|E
