40|$|The 2014 {{elections}} to the European Parliament represent an important {{moment in the}} relationship between the EU and Eurosceptic voices. At one level, the increasing numbers of Eurosceptic MEPs reflects a generalised discontent in electorates (albeit not all of it particularly directed to the EU), a discontent that will have a higher profile in the EP’s work for the next five years. At another, the <b>Spitzenkandidaten</b> <b>process</b> has introduced an element of politicisation to the Commission that potentially creates new opportunities for eurosceptics to challenge the process of European integration...|$|E
40|$|The {{makeup of}} the new European Commission was {{announced}} by Jean-Claude Juncker on 10 September. Following the announcement, Andrew Glencross writes on the constitutional implications of the so-called <b>Spitzenkandidaten</b> <b>process</b> for the new Commission’s role. He argues that the process could {{be understood as a}} parallel to the use of direct democracy in Switzerland or a directly elected President in the United States to grant citizens a more direct connection with fundamental constitutional change. However this form of ‘presidentialisation’ in the Commission’s case is unlikely to bring about ‘bottom up’ constitutional agency overnight, particularly given the indirect nature of Juncker’s appointment...|$|E
40|$|In the end, {{the system}} of Spitzenkandidaten or Top Candidate has prevailed despite unease or even {{outright}} opposition {{from a number of}} Member States. This could be seen as a victory of the European Parliament, especially since it does now create expectations about the European Parliament strongly influencing future decisions. However, it is not straightforward: the <b>Spitzenkandidaten</b> <b>process</b> did not encourage higher participation, implying that the legitimacy question is far from answered. In addition, Member States unhappy with the EP gaining more and more powers might well look into how the powers of the EP can be curtailed in future, for example through greater involvement of national parliaments...|$|E
40|$|In {{this new}} commentary, CEPS Fellow Marco Incerti {{argues that the}} {{so-called}} technical and legal arguments that are being advanced against the lead candidates’ (<b>Spitzenkandidaten)</b> selection <b>process</b> actually boil down to political choices − choices that are set against the increasingly confrontational climate between the European Council and European Parliament that has characterised their dealings in recent years...|$|R
40|$|Although {{still in}} its early phases, the Juncker Commission has already broken new ground. Not only is Jean-Claude Juncker the first Commission President to be {{selected}} by the <b>Spitzenkandidaten</b> <b>process,</b> an extra-constitutional system that has reconfigured the European Union’s institutional balance, but he has transformed the structure and operation of the College {{in order to create}} a more political, and therefore more effective, Commission, and made good – so far – on his promise ‘to do better on the bigger things and be small on the small things’. This article examines this three-fold transformation. It looks at the innovations and change associated with the Juncker Commission. It considers what motivated them and how they were achieved, sets them in historical perspective, and discusses their implications for the institutions and for the EU more broadly...|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{describes the}} process of the enforcement of the Spitzenkandidaten procedure into the EU political system. An ambiguous definition of the relation between the Commission Presidential Candidacy and European election results, which emerged in the Lisbon treaty, {{led to the creation of}} a new political precedent that has real chances to remain for good among the EU procedures. This thesis will nevertheless show that suggestions that the victorious party should name its candidate for the Commission President are not new. Moreover, it will highlight that {{the process of}} the EP and the Commission getting ever closer is a result of a much longer process. The arguments for and against the new procedure will be presented and evaluated. A detailed insight into the European elections 2014 campaign, which had a partially different shape due to the <b>Spitzenkandidaten</b> <b>process,</b> will provide the reader with an answer to which extent the outcomes of the elections were actually influenced by this exact procedure. The same objective is borne in mind when the candidacy of Jean-Claude Juncker is evaluated, proving him to be, although elected not traditionally, a candidate-as-usual. Lastly, this bachelor thesis tackles the problems of disturbed interinstitutional dynamics due to the enforcement of [...] ...|$|E
