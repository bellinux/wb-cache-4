5|$|The {{publisher}} of paperbacks, Penguin Books, introduced {{a range of}} books for children under the Puffin Books brand in 1939. At first these were non-fiction titles but these were soon followed by a fiction list of well-known authors. The demand {{was so great that}} Puffin Book Clubs were introduced in schools to encourage reading, and a children's magazine Puffin Post was established. There is a tradition on the Icelandic island of Heimaey for the children to rescue young puffins, a fact recorded in Bruce McMillan's photo-illustrated children's book Nights of the Pufflings (1995). The fledglings emerge from the nest and try to {{make their way to the}} sea but <b>sometimes</b> <b>get</b> confused, perhaps by the street lighting, ending up by landing in the village. The children collect them and liberate them to the safety of the sea.|$|E

25|$|A typical episode {{features}} several vignettes of {{the everyday}} life of a couple, with the camera mostly centered on them. Often other characters are cropped, giving the programme its unique visual style. The couple receive friends for supper, go to the convenience store, or leave on a trip, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>get</b> on each other's nerves. Their quirks, and loving bickering, provide much of the program's humor. The graphic design style associated with the original Un gars, une fille, which consists of a palette of pastel blue and pink, and rough lines and scribbles, (seen in the transition graphics, see Original section), {{as well as a}} logo with simulated printing mistakes and smears, has been imitated by most of the other versions, with the notable exception of the American version. The character names are often those of the actors, as in the first version.|$|E

He is a hard drinker, particularly fond of rum and of Scotch whisky, especially Loch Lomond; his bouts of drunkenness are often used for comic effect, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>get</b> him into serious trouble.|$|E
500|$|After high school, Rollins {{attended}} American University in Washington D.C. for one semester, but {{dropped out}} in December 1979. He began working minimum-wage jobs, including {{a job as}} a courier for kidney samples at the National Institutes of Health. Rollins developed an interest in punk rock after he and his friend Ian MacKaye procured a copy of The Ramones's eponymous debut album; he later described it as [...] "akin to shooting heroin." [...] From 1979 to 1980, Rollins was working as a roadie for Washington bands, including Teen Idles. When the band's singer Nathan Strejcek failed to appear for practice sessions, Rollins convinced the Teen Idles to let him sing. Word of Rollins's ability spread around the punk rock scene in Washington; Bad Brains singer H.R. would <b>sometimes</b> <b>get</b> Rollins on stage to sing with him.|$|E

500|$|Bird's {{experiments}} with his cell were {{important for the}} new discipline of electrometallurgy. [...] An unforeseen result was the deposition of copper on and within the plaster, without any contact with the metal electrodes. [...] On breaking apart the plaster {{it was found that}} veins of copper were formed running right through it. [...] So surprising was this result that it was at first disbelieved by electrochemical researchers, including Faraday. [...] Deposition of copper and other metals had previously been noted, but only on metal electrodes. [...] Bird's experiments <b>sometimes</b> <b>get</b> him credit for being the founder of the industrial field of electrometallurgy. [...] In particular, Bird's discovery is the principle behind electrotyping. [...] However, Bird himself never made practical use of this discovery, nor did he carry out any work in metallurgy as such. [...] Some of Bird's contemporaries with interests in electrometallurgy wished to bestow the credit on Bird in order to discredit the commercial claims of their rivals.|$|E
500|$|King is {{credited}} {{as one of}} the first bowlers to utilise swing bowling deliberately. Other bowlers in his time could <b>sometimes</b> <b>get</b> the ball to swing, but King w{{as one of the}} first to do so at will with an old or new ball. He made use of a lethal delivery which he called the [...] "angler", a product of his experience as a baseball pitcher, to confuse the English batsmen. He would come in with the ball clasped above his head in both hands as would a baseball pitcher. He was famous for his late swing—in and out—and would produce the in-swinger with his right hand coming down from a point over his left shoulder. He described it as an in-swinger which, if properly bowled, would change direction sharply in the last 10 or [...] of flight. King used this ball only sparingly and only against good batsmen. After a tour to Philadelphia by an Australian side in 1896, George Giffen said [...] "the Philadelphians really have some high-class players, but it was the fact of their bowlers playing us with baseball curves that upset our batsmen." ...|$|E
500|$|EX Media lauds Oda's art for its [...] "crispy" [...] {{monochrome}} pictures, [...] "great use {{of subtle}} shade changes" [...] on color pages, [...] "sometimes exquisite" [...] use of angles, {{and for its}} consistency. Shaenon K. Garrity, who at some point edited the series for English Shonen Jump, said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda's craft grew steadily. She states that [...] "he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga format," [...] notes that [...] "interesting things [...] going on deep in the narrative structure," [...] and recommends [...] "sticking through to the later volumes {{to see just how}} crazy and Peter Max-y the art gets". Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that [...] "One Piece is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama." [...] He praised Oda's artwork as [...] "imaginative and creative" [...] and comments that [...] "Oda's imagination just oozes all of the panels [...] ". He also notes that [...] "Oda's panel work [...] features a lot of interesting perspectives and direction, especially during the explosive action sequences which are always a blast," [...] though he complains that the panels can <b>sometimes</b> <b>get</b> [...] "a little chaotic".|$|E

5000|$|On several {{occasions}} {{some or all}} Flemish parties bundled forces on 'Vlaams Kartel' lists for municipal elections in Brussels (in Dutch Vlaams Kartel), <b>sometimes</b> <b>getting</b> together one or two seats in the municipal council, <b>sometimes</b> <b>getting</b> none. As these parties are minority parties in every Brussels municipality, i.e., the parties of an ethnic or linguistic minority (on the average 10-15% of the population), {{this is a case}} of an electoral coalition of ethnic parties.|$|R
500|$|The {{fact that}} Tucker goes free upholds {{a common theme}} in Homicide: Life on the Street – that life is not always fair, and that criminals <b>sometimes</b> <b>get</b> away with their crimes, a {{conviction}} that often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives. Fontana deliberately wrote the script {{so that it would}} remain ambiguous whether Tucker committed the murder or not. He wanted the character to have a genuine feeling of love for Adena Watson, but the strong feelings do not specifically mean he killed the girl. Braugher praised Fontana for creating such a three-dimensional character in Tucker, and said, [...] "Fontana's genius is that we are never quite certain as to what it is that we have on our hands." [...] Fontana also wanted Pembleton and Bayliss to have different interpretations of the same interrogation; Bayliss begins the interview convinced of the man's guilt and becomes uncertain by the end, and Pembleton has the opposite experience. Multiple police departments have requested copies of [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] for use in training sessions due to its accurate portrayal of the intricacies of the police interrogation process. The interrogation included several police tactics not typically featured in television dramas, including the presentation of false evidence in an attempt to get a confession.|$|E
500|$|Love in Several Masques is a {{traditional}} comic drama that incorporates morality. The theme of the play is the relationship of disguises and courtship {{with a discussion of}} the nature of love. Fielding focuses on men and how they deal with love and marriage. Also, the gentlemen must prove their worth before they can be justified in their marriage, which allows Fielding to describe the traits required in successful male suitors. The first act deals primarily with the gentlemen in order to establish a focus on their characteristics. Fielding's first play serves as a representation for his belief in the relationship of morality and libertine beliefs and introduces character types that he would use throughout his plays and novels. However, all negative characteristics are very apparent to the audience, and those characters who are immoral are unable to accomplish their goals. The main characters are still decent individuals who are able to help another, even though they <b>sometimes</b> <b>get</b> in each other's way. At no time is the audience able to believe that vice will conquer, which undermines part of the satire. Regardless, Harold Pagliaro is still able to conclude that [...] "Fielding's satire on the marriage market, however, is effective, if not biting." ...|$|E
500|$|Cousy {{was one of}} six freshmen on the Holy Cross Crusaders' varsity {{basketball}} team in 1946–47. From {{the start of the}} season, coach Doggie Julian chose to play the six freshmen off the bench in a two-team system, so that each player would get some time on the court. As members of the [...] "second team", they would come off the bench nine and a half minutes into the game, where they would relieve the [...] "first team" [...] starters. They would <b>sometimes</b> <b>get</b> to play as much as a third or even half of the game, but even at that Cousy was so disappointed with the lack of playing time that he went to the campus chapel after practice to pray that Julian would give him more of a chance to show off his talents on the court. Early in the season, however, he got into trouble with Julian, who accused him of being a showboater. Even as late as that 1946–47 season basketball was a static game, depending on slow, deliberate player movement and flat-footed shots. Far different was Cousy's up-tempo, streetball-like game, marked by ambidextrous finesse play and notable for behind-the-back dribbling and no-look, behind-the-back and half-court passing. Even so, he had enough playing time in games to score 227 points for the season, finishing with the third-highest total on the team. Led by stars George Kaftan and Joe Mullaney, the Crusaders finished the 1946–47 basketball season 24–3.|$|E

500|$|Flynn has {{received}} generally mixed reviews from film critics. Kirk Baird of The Blade [...] described the character as irresistible, while Columbus Alives Brad Keefe called him [...] "loveable". Georgie Hobbs of Little White Lies lauded Flynn as [...] "a hero invested with enough colour to liven up {{what could have}} been a monochromatic role". Margot Harrison of Seven Days concluded that the character is [...] "better than a prince". Meanwhile, Amy Nicholson of Inland Empire Weekly reviewed the character as a significant improvement upon traditional Disney heroes, writing, [...] "If anything, Tangled is hommepowerment—one more step forward in Disney's slow march to treat male suitors like equals, from its early nameless princes ... to here, a dude with a full-on personality and nearly equal screen time." [...] Tyler Hanley of the Palo Alto Weekly observed that [...] "Flynn talks in a laid-back way that helps make his character both likable and relatable". Ian Bunting of the Daily Record concluded that although [...] "Male characters <b>sometimes</b> <b>get</b> shortchanged in Disney movies ... Flynn is one of their better efforts to add to Aladdin, Mowgli and the Beast." [...] Virtually an equal amount of critics were less impressed with Flynn. Anthony Quinn of The Independent described the character as a [...] "fop", while Tom Huddleston of Time Out called him [...] "bland". The Scotsman wrote, [...] "it's a shame the prominence of Rapunzel's wayward love interest ... needlessly distracts from" [...] the film.|date = January 27, 2015|accessdate = February 24, 2015|website = The Scotsman|publisher = Johnston Publishing Ltd|last = |first = }} Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called Flynn [...] "a second-rate Nickelodeon TV punk". Jeff Meyers of the Metro Times dismissed Flynn as not [...] "all that heroic". The Houston Chronicles Amy Biancolli quipped that Flynn's [...] "sensitive chin fur, and the way he talks out of the side of his mouth [...] makes him look like Dick Cheney at a poetry slam". The Los Angeles TimesKenneth Turan believes that the film's [...] "initial shakiness" [...] is [...] "amplified by the irritating and overly glib nature of" [...] Flynn. Accusing the character of [...] "lacking both superficial and emotional individuality", Jake Coyle of the Southtown Star panned Flynn as [...] "rather obnoxious", Dan Kois of The Village Voice dismissed him as [...] "vanilla". Flynn's narration has also been widely panned. Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referred to it as [...] "flippant". A. O. Scott of The New York Times described it as [...] "annoyingly smart-alecky". Justin Chang of Variety described the character's opening monologue as [...] "clunky". William Goss of Moviefone compared Flynn to [...] "a modern-day Chris Evans/Pine type, and his glib narration [...] combined with a hasty prologue [...] almost makes it feel like writer Dan Fogelman is trying too hard to make this a boys' AND girls' club". However, Goss relented, [...] "The voice-over tapers off, though, and Levi proves to be a suitably cocky foil to the neurotic love interest." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bob Thomas, senior {{executive}} {{of the church in}} the early 1970s, gave a prosaic description.The immediate goal of the E-meter is to enhance communication. In other words, just to take a parallel: if an analyst were allowing his patient to free-associate, and the patient were connected in some way with a galvanometer which showed the analyst what things the patient mentioned were emotionally charged and what things were not emotionally charged, a lot of time would be saved. So it's simply an assist for the practitioner to direct the individual to areas which he himself may not realize are troubled or charged with emotion or are repressed; and to better direct his attention into those areas ...The E-meter is a simple psycho-galvanometer. It's got some increased sensitivity built into it and the myological reactions that you <b>sometimes</b> <b>get</b> in the galvanometer have been damped out by the circuitry, so that the mental reactions, the reactions of the spirit, on the body are emphasized and can be read more clearly. But that's simply the design of the circuitry; it doesn't basically affect the kind of device. It registers what is called, commonly, the psychogalvanomic reflex, which is a reflex that is a poorly understood mechanism of the psyche. The body resistance seems to vary when the individual thinks of a painful or pain-associated or traumatic-associated concept, or word or idea. ...

2500|$|In {{the midst}} of this turmoil, which also {{included}} Clinton pledging government-level support to Japan {{in the wake of the}} devastating 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Clinton reiterated in a mid-March CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer during her post-revolution visit to Cairo's Tahrir Square that she had no interest in becoming Secretary of Defense or vice president or of running for president again. She also explicitly said for the first time that she did not want to serve a second term as Secretary of State if President Obama is re-elected in 2012. She stressed how much she regarded her current position: [...] "Because I have the best job I could ever have. This is a moment in history where it is almost hard to catch your breath. There are both the tragedies and disasters that we have seen from Haiti to Japan and there are the extraordinary opportunities and challenges that we see right here in Egypt and in the rest of the region." [...] But reportedly she was weary at times from constant travelling, still not part of Obama's inner circle, and looking forward to a time of less stress and the chances to write, teach, or work for international women's rights. She was not bound by her statements, and Blitzer for one suspected she would change her mind. In any case, she remained popular with the American public; her Gallup Poll favorability rating rose to 66percent (against 31percent unfavorable), her highest mark ever save for a period during the Lewinsky scandal thirteen years earlier. Her favorability was 10 to 20 percentage points higher than those for Obama, Biden, or Gates, and reflected in part the high ratings that secretaries of state <b>sometimes</b> <b>get.</b>|$|E
