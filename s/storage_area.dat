5|$|The Nuclear Weapons <b>Storage</b> <b>Area</b> at Loring once {{operated}} as a separate, {{top secret}} facility. Originally called the North River Depot, the remote {{area to the}} northeast of Loring's property was the first U.S. operational site specifically constructed for the storage, assembly, and testing of atomic weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{battleship}} {{was under}} fire at Wonsan 27 May– 29 May, but her five-inch (127mm) guns silenced the counter-fire, and her 16-inch shells destroyed five gun emplacements and four gun caves. She also hit a target that flamed spectacularly: either a fuel <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> or an ammunition dump.|$|E
5|$|Coal was {{expected}} {{to be able to be}} delivered to the station by rail, as well as by ship to the Port of Blyth. The station's coal <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> would have stored a minimum 45 days worth of coal supply. All of the station's pulverised fuel ash (PFA) may have been sold to the construction industry, transported to which in dry dust tankers. Unsold PFA and furnace bottom ash would be taken to a landfill site by road.|$|E

Not all <b>storage</b> <b>areas</b> can be covered, however, so a means of estimating storage conditions is needed. This report describes one such technique...|$|R
5|$|Freight volumes {{remained}} high {{throughout the}} following decades. In the late 1950s, the Swedish Air Force built a 32 million kroner <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> for aviation fuel at Muruvik. The terminal {{would be a}} reserve {{in case of an}} attack on Sweden, and the Meråker Line was to be used to transport the fuel into Sweden. The depot was sold in 1988 to Petrofina, following the Royal Norwegian Air Force's quest to build a pipeline to the NATO-base at Trondheim Airport, Værnes.|$|E
5|$|He next {{went down}} to the first-floor cafeteria, in which about a hundred people were gathered. The crowd {{scattered}} after he shot a woman standing near the kitchens and wounded another student. Entering an unlocked <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> {{at the end of the}} cafeteria, Lépine shot and killed two more women hiding there. He told a male and female student to come out from under a table; they complied and were not shot.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{radioactive}} contamination from Rocky Flats came from three sources: a catastrophic fire in 1957, leaking barrels in an outdoor <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> in 1964-1968, and another less severe fire in 1969. Plutonium, {{used to construct}} the weapons' fissile components, can spontaneously combust at room temperatures in air. Additional sources of actinide contamination include inadequate pondcrete vitrification attempts and routine releases during the decades of plant operations.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "garde manger" [...] is {{also related}} to the cold rooms inside castles and manor houses where the food was stored. These food <b>storage</b> <b>areas</b> were usually located in the lower levels, since the cool basement-like {{environment}} was ideal for storing food. These cold <b>storage</b> <b>areas</b> developed over time into the modern cold kitchen.|$|R

5|$|The {{basement}} of the house initially served as the wine <b>storage</b> <b>area.</b> In 1867, the family had a one-and-a-half-story brick winery constructed. After 1900, when wine grapes were no longer grown commercially, this building served as a storage room. Rübel later converted it to a museum for Ramona visitors, complete with Del Valle family artifacts. In the 21st century it is used for storage of farm equipment and automobiles.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mission of}} the new {{operation}} was launched on 2 March against an ammunition <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> near Xom Bang. On the same day, 19 VNAF A-1 Skyraiders struck the Quang Khe Naval Base. The Americans were shocked when six of their aircraft were shot down during the mission. Five of the downed crewmen were rescued, {{but it was a}} portent of things to come.|$|E
5|$|The jetty {{facilities}} used two cranes to offload coal, {{with the capacity}} of unloading two ships at one time, {{at a rate of}} 480 tonnes an hour. Coal was also delivered by rail to the east of the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site. Coal was usually delivered to the jetty, rather than by rail. A conveyor belt system was then used to take coal to the coal <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> or directly to the station's boiler rooms. The conveyor belt system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The coal <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000 tonnes of coal. This had an overhead gantry with a conveyor belt attached to the conveyor belt system, for taking coal from the coal store to the boiler rooms.|$|E

5|$|The {{next night}} at 1945 hrs, a craft {{similar to the}} one the night before {{approached}} the base. In addition to being tracked on radar, it hovered around the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. Additionally, it hovered above the weapons <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear if it was the same one as the over the weapons <b>storage</b> <b>area,</b> but it is possible) was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as hovering in mid-air, jerking around, and turning on and off its lights once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, the object was chased, and eventually discovered to be hovering five feet off the ground. During this time, it was determined that the object was four car lengths long.|$|E
5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E
5|$|After {{the school}} closed in 1953, the larger, {{original}} room was {{converted into a}} bus garage by the Chana School District. A large garage door was cut into {{the building and the}} floor completely removed. The smaller, 1893 room became a <b>storage</b> <b>area.</b> In 1962, the Chana School District ran out of room and used the building as an overflow classroom. By the mid-1960s, the Chana District folded and was absorbed by the Oregon School District. Residents were allowed to remove any items from the school after the district shut down.|$|E

5|$|Loring {{was also}} home to many {{facilities}} that {{were a part of}} the base, or were nearby. Caribou Air Force Station was the weapons <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> that operated separately from Loring until it was absorbed in 1961. Caswell Air Force Station operated to the east, but had a unit associated with Loring before it became fully operational. On-base facilities included the Alert Area, which operated as a separate facility within Loring, due to crews being constantly stationed on alert. The Double Cantilever Hangar was the largest hangar at the facility, with the capacity to hold six parked B-52s, or five B-36s.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium milling {{operations}} produced {{large quantities}} of toxic cutting fluid contaminated with particles of plutonium and uranium. Thousands of 55-gallon drums of the waste were stored outside in an unprotected earthen area called the 903 pad <b>storage</b> <b>area,</b> where they corroded and leaked radionuclides over years into the soil and water. An estimated 5,000 gallons of plutonium-contaminated oil leached into the soil between 1964 and 1967. Portions of this waste, mixed with dust that composed Pad 903, became airborne in the heavy winds of the Front Range and contaminated offsite areas {{to the south and}} east.|$|E
5|$|Since Innogy plc {{was taken}} over by RWE in 2002, the site has been owned by RWE Npower. The only {{substantial}} structures remaining are the National Grid and NEDL substations. These buildings will continue to remain and there are plans to extend the National Grid substation. The rest of the power station site is unused brownfield land. The site of the main station buildings is currently covered in crushed concrete, left over from the demolition process. Underground workings, such as tunnels and culverts, also still exist on the site. The coal <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> to the north has been tarmaced and ash settling ponds have been filled with concrete. Some ash mounds are still situated to the east of the site.|$|E

5|$|The Mormons {{had planned}} to use the profits from sale of the earlier books to fund {{printing}} of more books, and in anticipation Orson Pratt had already transcribed the complete Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, and John Jaques's Catechism for Children. Pratt had also prepared an apparent sequel to the primers, the Deseret Phonetic Speller. After the sales failure, however, none of these books were ever published and were thought lost until being rediscovered in a <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> of the LDS Church Archives in Salt Lake City in May 1967.|$|E
5|$|The primary rooms {{include the}} Lair, Hatchery, Training Room, Library, and the Treasury. These {{have the same}} purpose as the first game: they {{function}} as a resting place, feeding place, training area, research area, and gold <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> respectively. The only major {{difference is that the}} Training Room can only train creatures up to experience level four. Further experience can only be gained through real combat, such as fighting in the new Combat Pit, where creatures fight to the death. The higher a creature's experience level, the stronger and more powerful they become. The highest experience level is level ten, and creatures cannot achieve levels nine or ten via the Training Room or Combat Pit.|$|E
5|$|At 2045 hrs, {{another person}} on {{duty in the}} control tower {{received}} a call to track the mysterious craft on radar. For the next 40 minutes, it was observed circling around the weapons <b>storage</b> <b>area,</b> when it suddenly vanished, {{as though it had}} landed or dropped below the radar. Witnesses later observed it flying away towards Grand Falls, New Brunswick, twelve miles to the east. Messages were sent to the National Military Command Center, the Air Force Chief of Staff, and Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base. The base continued to remain on a high state of alert until the following morning, as efforts to identify the unidentified aircraft through the Maine State Police, local police departments, and the Houlton Federal Aviation Administration office remained elusive.|$|E
