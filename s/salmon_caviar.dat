50|$|The income {{elasticity}} of a superior good is above one by definition, because {{it raises the}} expenditure share as income rises. A superior good also may be a luxury good that is not purchased at all below {{a certain level of}} income. Examples would include smoked <b>salmon</b> and <b>caviar,</b> and most other delicacies. On the other hand, superior goods may have a wide quality distribution, such as wine and holidays; however, though the number of such goods consumed may stay constant even with rising wealth, the level of spending will go up, to secure a better experience.|$|R

This is typically complemented by some herbs and vegetables such as parsley, cold salad, thinly sliced cucumber, tomato wedges and/or pickled beets etc. on the same slice of bread.|$|E
50|$|Smörgåskaviar is a {{fish roe}} spread eaten in Scandinavia and Finland. It {{differs from the}} more common {{sturgeon}} or <b>salmon</b> <b>caviar</b> {{in that it is}} made from cod roe and a variable mix of other ingredients. These can include mashed potatoes, tomato sauce, onion, salt and often dill or chives. It is usually sold in smoked and non-smoked variants, as well as in variants with a prominent taste of dill, for instance Öhnbergs Dill-kaviar. The most common brand in Sweden is Kalles kaviar.|$|E
50|$|Excursion Inlet was {{originally}} an Alaska Native village. Excursion Inlet {{has had a}} fishing cannery since 1891. The current plant, constructed in 1918, still functions to this day. It mostly processes pink and chum salmon, as well as salmon roe, <b>salmon</b> <b>caviar,</b> halibut and sablefish. It is located {{near the mouth of}} the inlet, about 40 mi west of Juneau.

50|$|Sharon holds a wine, {{cigar and}} liquor tasting session {{for the girls}} where {{they learn how to}} {{properly}} enjoy these things. Lacey, a supporter of animal rights, discusses bowhunting with Brandi M., at which point Kristy Joe reveals that Lacey had been eating <b>salmon</b> and <b>caviar</b> previously. Dallas calls out Lacey, accusing her of hypocrisy, and then walks away. Lacey, wanting to end it, follows Dallas to her bedroom, gets on her bed and wipes her feet on Dallas clothes. Wanting to then make peace with Dallas, Lacey tries to speak, but Dallas refuses to discuss anything. Lacey becomes aggressive towards Dallas, shouting at her while Brandi C. holds her back. As things quiet down, Brandi C. goes into the bathroom, at which point Lacey resumes her aggression and knocks over Dallas drink, spilling it on her and then walks away. Heather, watching all of this, is impressed with Dallas restraint.|$|R

In 1980 he {{became a member of the}} band Narodno Blago (National Treasure) which performed rhythm and blues and occasionally performed as the supporting band for Split punk rock musician Fon Biškić, with whom they performed covers of The Rolling Stones, Ramones and The Clash songs. Narodno Blago disbanded in 1983, and Belan became the member of the band Aquilla. The band performed Dalmatian folk songs, and Belan played mandolin.|$|E
50|$|The current {{economy is}} based {{primarily}} on fishing, especially the harvest of <b>salmon</b> <b>caviar,</b> mushroom gathering, and government services and subsidies. Despite living {{in an environment that}} is extremely rich with wildlife, the inhabitants of the island are very restricted in the use of these resources since almost the entire island is a nature preserve. In the years following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, poaching of fish, Arctic fox, reindeer (which were introduced to the island), and migratory waterfowl was widespread, but there is virtually no harvest of marine mammals due to strict protection.|$|E
5000|$|The fourth floor, also {{referred}} to as the ThEATery (a portmanteau of [...] "theater" [...] and [...] "eatery"), has the majority of the mall's restaurants and includes several casual dining restaurants, such as Buffalo Wild Wings, T.G.I. Friday's, Chili's, East Japanese, Outback Steakhouse, Dave & Buster's, McDonald's, Tony Roma's, IHOP, Red Robin, Yard House, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Joe's Crab Shack. East, which serves Japanese cuisine, has been praised in particular. Its selling point is a conveyor belt that moves items at eye level, which can be selected by diners, who pay for them later. The restaurant's Philadelphia Roll, which is made with <b>salmon,</b> <b>caviar,</b> avocado and cream cheese, was lauded by New York Times critic Joe Queenan.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{any food}} served before {{the main course}} is {{technically}} an hors d'oeuvre, the phrase is generally limited to individual items, such as cheese or fruit. A glazed fig topped with mascarpone and wrapped with prosciutto is an hors d'oeuvre, and plain figs served on a platter may also be served as hors d'oeuvres. It could be pickled beets or anchovy eggs as topping over tomatoes {{as part of the}} initial [...] "drinks" [...] session such as of alcoholic or non alcoholic beverages. They are also served in the forms of dips, spreads, pastries, olives or nuts with or without a base of egg, cheese, meats, vegetables, seafood or breads. Single cold items served are smoked <b>salmon,</b> avocado pear, <b>caviar,</b> pâté, shellfish cocktails and melon with garnishes and decorations. Seasoned hot dishes served are of vegetables, meat, fish, egg, pasta, cheese, soufflés, tartlets, puff pastry or choux pastry.|$|R
40|$|Differences in the come-up {{times and}} thermal {{inactivation}} parameters of Listeria innocua in <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus keta) <b>caviar</b> containing 2. 5 % salt using conventional thermal-death-time (TDT) glass tubes and a novel aluminum tube were tested and compared. Generally, the come-up times and decimal reduction times (D-values) were shorter {{and the change}} in temperature required to change the D-value (z-value) was longer in the aluminum than in the glass tubes. The D-values at 60, 63, and 658 C for the aluminum TDT tubes were 2. 97, 0. 77, and 0. 40 min, respectively, and for the glass TDT tubes, these values were 3. 55, 0. 84, and 0. 41 min. The z-values were 5. 78 C in the aluminum and 5. 38 C in the glass. Because of the shorter come-up time, the aluminum TDT tubes may provide a more precise measurement of microbial thermal inactivation than the glass TDT tubes, particularly for viscous materials, solid foods, and foods containing particulate matter. The reported values for the thermal inactivation of pathogens in foods can vary widely. Some of this variance may be because of a failure to use proper kinetic models (18, 19). However, some differences may result from ex-perimental methodology. Often, little {{attention is paid to}} the design of a thermal-death-time (TDT) tube type, which ma...|$|R
40|$|Russian Ambassadors in Leghorn and the Relationship between Muscovy and Tuscany in the Seventeenth Century]. In 1656 and in 1660 some ambassadors of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich of Russia {{arrived in}} Livorno. The {{first of these}} embassies, led by Ivan Ivanovich Chemodanov and the clerk Alexei Posnikov, was in fact {{directed}} in Venice but the stay of just over a month in Livorno was an important stage for the Russian ambassadors. The second mission, led by Vasily Bogdanovich Lichachaev and the clerk Ivan Fomin, was directly addressed to Tuscany although this time, the ambassadors stayed for only five days at Livorno. In both cases the presence of Russian diplomats in the city attracted much attention and left many documentary traces that are described in detail in the article. In April 1663 another Muscovite ambassador arrived in Florence: Ivan Afanas’evich Zheljabuzhskij. The three Russian embassies in Tuscany, in 1657, 1660 and 1663, laid the foundations for stable trade relations with Muscovy, which increased progressively with the gradual opening of that country to the West that characterized {{the last years of}} the reign of Alexei and those of the regency of Sophia Alexeevna. Villani highlights the importance of Dutch and English mediation in the development of Russian-Tuscan relations, and especially the role that played Charles Longland. It also shows that behind these missions stood the intention to develop commerce of some Russian goods in which the Italian markets were particularly interested in, including leather, <b>salmon</b> and <b>caviar.</b> The consolidation and development of trade between Muscovy and the Mediterranean area during the 1660 s and 1670 s was also thanks to the brokerage of Francesco Guasconi (a Florentine living in Muscovy), after Zheljabuzhskij’s 1663 mission time there were not direct diplomatic exchanges for a long and Tuscany was not even officially visited by Russian diplomats who travelled through Italy in those years. The resumption of direct talks with Muscovy occurred in the early 1680 s due to the morbid “scientific” and “ethnographic” curiosities of the Grand Duke Cosimo III, that in any case were, not directed to Muscovy itself but to the lands which bordered with China. In the summer of 1682 the Grand Duke asked to Francesco Gasconi to buy a Circassian slave for him in Muscovy. The Grand Duke liked to surround himself with young people of different nationalities to give an exotic touch to his court. These slaves were then forced to convert to Catholicism and as soon as they become adults, they were manumitted with a good pension. Apparently the Grand Duke had to wait a long time for the arrival of his young Circassian, and, before the promised gift a Russian ambassador arrived in Tuscany in February 1688. This diplomatic mission was not addressed only to the Grand Duke and was not to deal directly with specific Russian interests in Tuscany. On May 6, 1686, in Moscow, the “eternal” Peace between Russia and Poland had been signed, putting to an end decades of war between the two countries. It was a huge success of Moscow’s foreign policy and therefore, at the beginning of 1687, Sofia Alexeevna sent a series of diplomatic embassies to all European countries to officially give this news and to prompt the construction of a league against the Turkish. The ambassador for Tuscany was Vasily Timofeevich Postnikov. This was the first diplomatic mission in Tuscany after almost a quarter of a century. The survey of the Tuscan-Russian relations since the middle of the 1600 s highlights the role of the British as intermediaries between the Muscovites and Italians. And why {{in the course of the}} seventeenth century, Livorno – now the main English port for the Levant trade – also became the Italian port for Russian goods...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the nutritional value of <b>salmon</b> <b>caviar</b> and that of Pacific herring has been conducted showing that the herring caviar nutritional value is not inferior to the salmon one. One of the directions of processing caviar raw materials is the production of pasty products: pates, spreads, pastes, sauces, creams and oils. The successful development of such products using caviar raw materials is only possible by conducting regular analysis of food values, the study of structuring and emulsifying properties, which are currently not sufficiently studied. The functional and technological properties of Pacific herring have been investigated: water-binding capacity (WBC), water-holding capacity (WHC), emulsifying capacity (EC) etc. It has been experimentally established that the stability of emulsion systems from Pacific herring caviar affects the type of pretreatment of raw materials. Emulsions with fresh caviar have high functional and technological properties. Fresh caviar {{is characterized by the}} high rate of WBC equal to 76. 90...|$|E
