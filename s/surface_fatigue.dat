50|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>fatigue</b> is {{a process}} by which the surface of a {{material}} is weakened by cyclic loading, which is one type of general material fatigue. Fatigue wear is produced when the wear particles are detached by cyclic crack growth of microcracks on the surface. These microcracks are either superficial cracks or subsurface cracks.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between pitting corrosion and micropitting {{is the size}} of the pits after <b>surface</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Pits formed by micropitting are approximately 10-20 μm in depth, and micropitted metal often has a frosted or gray appearance. Normal pitting creates larger and more visible pits. Micropits are originated from the local contact of asperities produced by improper lubrication.|$|E
40|$|Spur gear {{endurance}} {{tests were}} conducted to investigate the <b>surface</b> pitting <b>fatigue</b> life of noninvolute gears with low numbers of teeth and low contact ratios for use in advanced applications. The results were compared with those for a standard involute design with a low number of teeth. The gear pitch diameter was 8. 89 cm (3. 50 in.) with 12 teeth on both gear designs. Test conditions were an oil inlet temperature of 320 K (116 F), an oil outlet temperature of 350 K (170 F), a maximum Hertz stress of 1. 49 GPa (216 ksi), and a speed of 10 000 rpm. The following results were obtained: the noninvolute gear had a <b>surface</b> pitting <b>fatigue</b> life approximately 1. 6 {{times that of the}} standard involute gear of a similar design; and the <b>surface</b> pitting <b>fatigue</b> life of the 3. 43 -pitch AISI 8620 noninvolute gear was approximately equal to the <b>surface</b> pitting <b>fatigue</b> life of an 8 -pitch, 28 -tooth AISI 9310 gear at the same load but at a considerably higher maximum Hertz stress...|$|R
40|$|A damaged input pinion, part No. 201 P 636 H 1302 201 bearing Sl. No. HDSN 527, {{belonging}} to Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) was forwarded to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed {{loss of material}} by spalling on the loading flank of two teeth of the pinion. Spalling was resulted due to <b>surface</b> contact <b>fatigue.</b> It was discovered that there were rough machining marks on the flank of the teeth. The stress concentrators at these machining marks {{were responsible for the}} premature <b>surface</b> contact <b>fatigue</b> crack initiation in the teeth. Subsequently, the <b>surface</b> contact <b>fatigue</b> has manifested in the form of spalling leading to loss of material from the loading flank surface. Evidences also suggest that probably, the working load on the pinion was in the higher side. It is believed that this in conjunction with the stress concentrators in the form of machining marks has accelerated the <b>surface</b> contact <b>fatigue</b> crack initiation. Laboratory test results show that the material of construction of the pinion conforms to the design specification in terms of chemical composition, microstructure, surface hardness, case depth, and core hardness. No metallurgical abnormalities were found responsible for the failure of the pinion. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report...|$|R

5000|$|Cavitation is a {{significant}} cause of wear in some engineering contexts. Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause cyclic stress through repeated implosion. This results in <b>surface</b> <b>fatigue</b> of the metal causing a type of wear also called [...] "cavitation". The most common examples {{of this kind of}} wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.|$|E
50|$|Lubricants are {{typically}} used to separate moving parts in a system. This separation has {{the benefit of}} reducing friction and <b>surface</b> <b>fatigue,</b> together with reduced heat generation, operating noise and vibrations. Lubricants achieve this in several ways. The most common is by forming a physical barrier i.e., {{a thin layer of}} lubricant separates the moving parts. This is analogous to hydroplaning, the loss of friction observed when a car tire is separated from the road surface by moving through standing water. This is termed hydrodynamic lubrication. In cases of high surface pressures or temperatures, the fluid film is much thinner and some of the forces are transmitted between the surfaces through the lubricant..|$|E
5000|$|When auto enthusiasts want to {{increase}} {{the power of the}} engine, they may add some type of forced induction. By compressing more air and fuel into each intake cycle, the power of the engine can be dramatically increased. This also increases the heat and pressure in the cylinder. The normal temperature of gasoline engine exhaust is approximately [...] This is also approximately the melting point of most aluminum alloys and it is only the constant influx of ambient air that prevents the piston from deforming and failing. Forced induction increases the operating temperatures while [...] "under boost", and if the excess heat is added faster than the engine can shed it, the elevated cylinder temperatures will cause the air and fuel mix to auto-ignite on the compression stroke before the spark event. This is one type of engine knocking that causes a sudden shockwave and pressure spike, which can result in failure of the piston due to shock-induced <b>surface</b> <b>fatigue,</b> which eats away the surface of the piston.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Surface {{integrity}} has a {{great effect}} on the fatigue property of titanium alloy. The <b>surface</b> integrity and <b>fatigue</b> property of a high speed milled Ti- 6. 5 Al- 2 Zr- 1 Mo- 1 V (TA 15) titanium alloy were investigated in this research. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to study the influence of milling speed on the <b>surface</b> integraty and <b>fatigue</b> property of the machined part. The surface roughness, work hardening, metallurgical structure and residual stress of the machined surface were studied in a cutting speed range of from 50 m/min to 300 m/min. To verify the relationship between cutting speed and the surface integrity of machined <b>surface,</b> the <b>fatigue</b> property of titanium alloy specimens milled at four different cutting speeds ranging from 50 to 200 m/min were compared at two stress levels. This research shows that the cutting speed has little effect on the work hardening, metallurgical structure and residual stress, but the surface roughness decreases with the increasing cutting speed. Therefore, increasing milling speed has a positive effect on the <b>surface</b> integrity and <b>fatigue</b> property of the machined surface...|$|R
40|$|It is {{recognized}} that wear processes of dental restorative materials {{may be related}} in part to <b>surface</b> <b>fatigue.</b> One of the major limitations {{to the use of}} posterior restorative materials has been localized material loss in contact areas, due to fatigue.
