50|$|When the fore-aft {{adjustment}} {{range of the}} saddle needs further extension than the clamp affords, {{it may be possible}} to add a saddle adjuster. One such adjuster mounts on the existing <b>saddle</b> <b>clamp</b> and allows up to 40mm of increase or decrease in the fore-aft position of the saddle. Another method for increasing the fore-aft adjustment is the swept-back seat post, where the seat post has a curve in it over the six inches or so before the saddle. Because of the gentle sweep of the tube, the top part of the seat-post cannot fit within the seat-tube, so this solution is useful only for high seat positions.|$|E
5000|$|... "Laprade" [...] seatposts (newer) use {{a single}} {{vertical}} bolt (typically an Allen bolt) which when tightened pushes two rail-grabbing pieces together. The lower {{surface of the}} lower rail-grabbing piece is convex and grooved, matching a concave groved {{on the top of}} the seat post. The curve allows the up/down angle of the saddle to be adjusted when the bolt is loosened, and loosening also allows the rails to slide forward and back. Depending on the saddle angle, the vertical bolt is not perpendicular to the angle of the rails, but the grooves prevent the interface from slipping and adopting a completely horizontal angle. This angular adjustment mechanism is known as pivotal and is common on BMX bikes. Because the grooves are finer than the grooved discs in the sold-separately <b>saddle</b> <b>clamp,</b> sometimes Laprade-style posts are also marketed as [...] "microadjustable" [...] even though the adjustment is not continuous as with the Campagnolo style.|$|E
40|$|<b>Saddle</b> <b>clamp</b> {{modified}} to prevent parts from falling off when installed or removed. Allows easy access for tightening or loosening bolts, and retains alignment with tube mounted in it when opened. All parts are held captive - bolts by retaining washers, floating nuts by pressing and swaging, and upper clamp band by tether. Upper and lower bolt flanges offset {{from each other}} to ensure access...|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two common}} types of {{built-in}} <b>saddle</b> <b>clamps</b> for standard rails, both associated with genericized trademarks: ...|$|R
50|$|I-beam rails {{are long}} and allow a wide fore-aft {{adjustment}} range. I-beam <b>saddle</b> <b>clamps</b> use two clamping bolts for grab pieces holding the single rail.|$|R
50|$|Another type of tremolo is the locking tremolo. These bridges {{have a sort}} of vise in each <b>saddle</b> which <b>clamps</b> {{the string}} into place (usually with an Allen key). The end of the string has a clamp, which holds the string in place, {{stopping}} it from slipping. It is especially useful for songs that require tapping or heavy/hard playing styles. Once set up for tuning stability, locking tremolos are very good. However, their fulcrum points offer extremely minute contact with the body, which may disturb sound transfer.|$|R
40|$|A <b>saddle</b> <b>clamp</b> {{assembly}} is presented. The assembly {{is comprised}} of a hollow cylindrical body centered about a longitudinal axis and being diametrically split into semicircular top and bottom sections. Each section has a pair of connection flanges, at opposite ends, that project radially outward. A pair of bolts are retained on the top section flanges and are threadable into nuts retained on the bottom section flanges. A base member is anchored to a central underside portion of the bottom clamp body section and has a pair of connection tabs positioned beneath the bottom clamp body section connection flanges {{on opposite sides of}} the clamp axis. A pair of bolts are retained on the base member connection tabs and are threadable into a pair of nuts retainable on a support structure. The connection tab and connection flanges on each side of the clamp body are axially offset in a manner permitting downward installation/removable tool access to the lower bolts past the connection flanges. An elongated retention tether is used to connect the top clamp body section to the balance of the clamp assembly. This prevents loss of the top clamp body section when it is removed from the bottom clamp body section...|$|E
