2500|$|As Edvard remembered it, Christian's {{positive}} {{behavior toward}} his children was overshadowed by his morbid pietism. Munch wrote, [...] "My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious—to {{the point of}} psychoneurosis. From him I inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood by my side <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> was born." [...] Christian reprimanded his children by telling them that their mother was looking down from heaven and grieving over their misbehavior. The oppressive religious milieu, Edvard's poor health, and the vivid ghost stories helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; the boy felt that death was constantly advancing on him. One of Munch's younger sisters, Laura, was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age. Of the five siblings, only Andreas married, but he died {{a few months after}} the wedding. Munch would later write, [...] "I inherited two of mankind's most frightful enemies—the heritage of consumption and insanity." ...|$|E

I know that things have changed very much <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when <b>I</b> myself found adventures possible and interesting, but have they really progressed so far as this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How long? <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> before yesterday. <b>I</b> {{never was}} so busy in my life. The duke, as usual, wants to have {{everything}} done at once." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{felt uncomfortable}} about {{going down to}} breakfast in the morning, as I had never set eyes on Mr. Murdstone <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> {{committed}} my memorable offence. However, as it must be done, I went down, {{after two or three}} false starts half-way, and as many runs back on tiptoe to my own room, and presented myself in the parlour.|$|R
6000|$|So I {{mixed up}} {{everything}} on the plate all together--made a sort of salad of it, in fact--and ate it with a spoon. A more disagreeable dish I have never tasted <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when <b>I</b> used to do Willie Evans's [...] "dags," [...] by walking twice through a sewer, and was subsequently, on returning home, promptly put to bed, and made to eat brimstone and treacle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{certainly}} be sorry {{to give up}} my own sword," [...] Fergus said. [...] "It was one of my father's, and <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when <b>I</b> was big enough to begin to use it, I have always exercised myself with it; though I, too, have learned to use the point a great deal, as I had a German instructor, as well as several Scottish ones." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There can be {{no doubt}} of that," [...] said Karlsefin, laughing; [...] "the colour of her cheek, the glance of her eye, and the tones of her voice, are all tell-tale.

6000|$|... "Nothing matters," [...] she said, {{completing}} me. [...] "I felt I {{had to tell}} you. I {{wanted you}} to understand why I didn't marry you--with both hands.

6000|$|Mrs. Ellmother's haggard face {{instantly}} softened. [...] "Please {{to forgive}} me, sir, for forgetting my manners," [...] she said simply.

40|$|Special {{dedication}} to my family, and particularly my mother {{who has been}} the pillar and epitome o f the family. in ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Researching and doing the study of this magnitude requires collaboration and involvement of many people. I am appreciative of the countless number of people involved in this project who time after time put forth the extra effort necessary to accomplish the assignment. In a special way, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. J. M. Munyoki, for his contribution and review of my work. I was stimulated and encouraged by his comments which 1 incorporated in the Paper. My thanks also go to, Mr. Jackson Maalu who moderated my work. I carefully and appreciated his suggestions which I incorporated in this Paper. I {{would also like to thank}} my peers who have been with me <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>I</b> started to pursue the Course. In particular, Solomon Odep was available for discussions and inspiration on the progress of the study. Carol and Nelly Kasina, who were my study team, encouraged me to complete the work in time...|$|R

[...] was {{his first}} exclamation, {{as he tried to}} clear his eyes, then he muttered {{something}} in Gaelic which, being incomprehensible, I cannot translate, although the worthy man has many a time, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of which <b>I</b> write, tried to explain it to me! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sorrow {{to it for}} male," [...] said Mooney. [...] "It's {{the worst}} vittles iver a man tooked into the inside of him.

6000|$|... "You are {{interrupting}} me," [...] he said sharply. [...] "You are {{a wealthy}} man, Rhynsault, {{thanks to the}} favours I have heaped upon you ever <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> picked you from your German kennel to set you where you stand. Here {{you will find a}} deed prepared.

6000|$|... "Yes--when I'm not at Samarcand! But surely we've diverged <b>since</b> <b>the</b> old <b>days.</b> <b>I</b> adore {{what you}} burn, you burn what I adore." [...] While the {{stranger}} spoke he looked cheerfully, hospitably, at Biddy; {{not because it}} was she, she easily guessed, {{but because it was}} in his nature to desire a second auditor--a kind of sympathetic gallery. Her life was somehow filled with shy people, and she immediately knew she had never encountered any one who seemed so to know his part and recognise his cues.|$|R
60|$|I turned towards my sister. She was {{standing}} at a little distance from me, silent and pale, mechanically twisting the measuring-string, which she still held between her trembling fingers; and fixing her eyes upon me so lovingly, so mournfully, that my fortitude gave way when I looked at her. At that instant, I seemed to forget everything that had passed <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> first met Margaret, and to be restored once more to my old {{way of life and}} my old home-sympathies. My head drooped on my breast, and I felt the hot tears forcing themselves into my eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "All very true, {{and to my}} shame I confess that, {{until this}} instant, the affair has been quite {{forgotten}} by me.

6000|$|... "No, we acted for the best; {{but things}} {{have turned out}} badly, and I feel more hopelessly at sea, as to what we had better do next, than I have done <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> got to Ostend. At any rate, {{there is nothing to}} be done until we have got a fair sight of the brigantine." ...|$|E
6000|$|And I, poor foolish I, deemed {{all this}} to be a mere foretaste of the delights of living I should find higher above me in society. I had lost many illusions <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> read [...] "Seaside Library" [...] novels on the California ranch. I was destined to lose many of the illusions I still retained.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's very beautiful, what I {{see from}} here. I haven't been {{strong enough to}} move round <b>since</b> <b>the</b> first <b>days.</b> But <b>I</b> am going to move now." [...] She smiled when Ransom made a gesture as if to help her, and added: [...] "Oh, I don't mean I am going {{to move out of}} my chair." ...|$|R
60|$|Grace partly approves of the foregoing, for {{she laid}} by her sewing {{to read the}} loose sheets beside me, bending down until her hair, which is bronze-gold with the sun in it, just touched my own. It may be that my eyes are prejudiced, but I {{have never seen a}} woman who might compare with her. Neither has her comeliness faded. Instead, it has grown even more refined and stately, for Grace had always a queenly way, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> first met her, the fairest maid--I think so now, though it is long ago--that ever trod the bleak moorlands of eastern Lancashire.|$|R
5000|$|On January 4, 2016, Treadwell {{announced}} he would forego his final year of eligibility at Ole Miss to enter the 2016 NFL Draft. Treadwell stated: [...] "After sitting down with my family, we have decided {{it is time for}} me {{to take the next step}} in my career and enter the NFL draft; it's always been a dream of mine to play in the NFL, and I can't thank my teammates, coaches and our great fans enough for their unbelievable support <b>since</b> <b>the</b> first <b>day</b> <b>I</b> stepped foot on campus.

"Assuredly you are right, my child, for it {{is amazing}} folly in such a man as Gunrig to suppose he is a fitting mate for you,--though it is no folly in him to wish to get you for a wife,--and it is no folly in you to flee from such an {{undesirable}} union.

6000|$|A languid {{smile of}} {{recognition}} {{lit up the}} latter's face. [...] "Ah! yes," [...] he said, glancing at them. [...] "The old lot: 'Carmelita,' 'Santa Maria,' and 'Preciosa!'

60|$|On {{the east}} coast of Scotland, hidden, as if in a quarry, at the foot of cliffs that may one day fall forward, is a village called Harvie. So has it shrunk <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> skulked from it that I hear of a traveller's asking lately at one of its doors how far he was from a village; yet Harvie throve once and was celebrated even in distant Thrums for its fish. Most of our weavers would have thought it as unnatural not to buy harvies in the square on the Muckle Friday, as to let Saturday night pass without laying in a {{sufficient}} stock of halfpennies to go round the family twice.|$|R

60|$|I was {{surprised}} at Angela. Odd how you never realize that every girl is at heart a vicious specimen until something goes wrong with her love affair.

A simple, jolly, kindly young pimple she had always struck me as--the sort you could more or less rely on not to hurt a fly. But here she was now laughing heartlessly--at least, I seemed to remember hearing her laugh heartlessly--like something cold and callous out of a sophisticated talkie, and fairly spitting on {{her hands in her}} determination to bring Tuppy's grey hairs in sorrow to the grave.|$|R
