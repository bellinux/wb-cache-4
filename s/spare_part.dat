Design/methodology/approach - This research adopted a quantitative approach, which utilised questionnaire surveys to study the relationship between the contributors of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management and maintenance cost performance. The data were analysed through descriptive analysis, correlation, and regression analysis. Additionally, a case study was examined to validate the results obtained from the survey.

Moreover, the results of the regression analysis indicated that the QSP was the significant predictor of MCV.

It recommends that maintenance management set up a <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management department for updating stocks frequently. Meanwhile, the management should avoid ad-hoc acquisition of <b>spare</b> <b>parts,</b> as this is always more expensive.

Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) bear the responsibility of undisrupted maintenance service and <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> flow for their capital products. Due to various factors OEMs lose their <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> suppliers occasionally and these losses threaten the reliability of their maintenance service and capital products. In this thesis, we consider supply risk in management of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> inventory. The thesis consists of two parts: First we develop advance indicators for future supply problems of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> and suggest a model utilizing those indicators for inventory control of <b>spare</b> <b>parts.</b> Our results indicate that OEMs can save significantly by utilizing those indicators together with our model in their daily business.

40|$|The {{aftermarket}} {{business is}} a highly profitable activity for companies, and they can earn considerable profits from selling <b>spare</b> <b>parts.</b> <b>Spare</b> <b>parts</b> demands are more uncertain and intermittent in comparison with finished goods and associated work in progress parts. In the aftermarket, the demand uncertainty of the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> for the OEMs {{is complicated by the}} fact that the other competitors, known as market players or will-fitters, supply substitutable parts usually with lower cost of production and deliver them to the market at cheaper prices. This uncertainty makes <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management challenging, and this study develops strategic approaches for <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> price setting and inventory level control to further exploit the benefits of the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> business. This dissertation is divided into four main parts. ^ In the first part, a brief review of inventory system policies is provided. The review starts with an introduction to the inventory systems terminology and follows with a categorization of the inventory systems with the aim of developing <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> inventory models. Moreover, a discussion about the computations related to the (Q,r) policy is provided. An algorithm is proposed to find the optimal re-order point/lot-size and a Monte Carlo simulation is designed to evaluate the mathematical optimization solutions including the new algorithm and the other classical methods. In the second part, a literature review related to <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management is presented. The literature review is organized in such a way that in the beginning the inventory control policies are introduced. Then the perspective of uniqueness of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> on the inventory management is illustrated. Next, <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> clustering and demand are studied and forecasting methods are reviewed. The use of Game Theory for inventory systems planning is studied. Also <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing as a strategic method to increase the profit of the suppliers is evaluated. In the third part, to investigate the profitability of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> business, the notion of renewal cost versus the replacement cost is proposed. The replacement cost of a product is defined as the current market price of the product and the renewal cost of a product is the acquisition cost of spares to completely renew the product excluding labor costs. These costs are calculated for some products with specific characteristics, and the ratio between the renewal cost and the replacement cost as a scale to evaluate the sustainability of the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing is determined which declares that the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing is unfair. In the last part, Game Theory as a tool to find ideal decision-making in <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management taking into account the interactions among <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> manufacturers. According to definite assumptions, <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> inventory games in the form of normal, cooperative and non-cooperative, non-zero-sum, evolutionary, and competitive fringes are studied. The proposed games study the OEMs 2 ̆ 7 decision-making on <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing strategies, inventory levels, batch productions and re-manufacturing efforts. ^ The proposed strategic <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing methods as an alternative for regular pricing can factor in customers 2 ̆ 7 willingness to purchase <b>spare</b> <b>parts,</b> demand uncertainty, market uncertainty, competitiveness of the parts in the market, stability of the cooperation or competition in price setting, marginal costs of designing an agreement for cooperation, and the marginal cost of production and inventory. Furthermore it is possible to add the notion of renewal cost and the replacement cost ratio to the price sustainability description and to include it in the suggested strategic pricing formulations as a factor that affects the demand and supply curves. ...|$|R
