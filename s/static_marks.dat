40|$|When Nicolae Ceauşescu {{delivered}} his final {{speech to the}} crowd gathered below Bucharest's Central Committee headquarters, he extended his “revolutionary ” greetings. Harun Farocki's documentary, Videograms of a Revolution, captures {{the moment when the}} crowd turned, and booed his words, instead of the cheers that the sovereign had become accustomed to over his 25 year tenure as Romania's dictator. When the jeering began, the cameras faltered, momentarily tilted up towards the sky from their previously fixed position on the figure of the sovereign on the balcony, before cutting out all together. Static aired for a few seconds, before the cameras once again began filming, but this time it was revolutionary footage. The brief moments of looking to the sky, followed by <b>static,</b> <b>marked</b> the transition of the nation's turn from Ceauşescu's rule to an unknown future. The sky and the <b>static</b> <b>marked</b> the moment of revolution. But were either Ceauşescu or the crowd opposing him en masse for the first time actually revolutionary? Where was the position of sovereignty located during this confrontation? Where, for that matter, was the spirit of communism? The moment when sovereign power passes from one body to another is what this essay will analyze, through three approaches: the concrete political example of the fall of Nicolae Ceauşescu, Romania's dictator from 1967 to 1989; Badiou's reflections on this event in his essay, “Philosophy and the Death of Communism”; and Spinoza's account of sovereign power in the Political Treaties. Through reading these examples, I will argue that the operative paradigm of interpretation which comes closest to naming the dynamics of such a transition of political power is “performative contradiction. ...|$|R
40|$|DDoS attack source traceback is an {{open and}} {{challenging}} problem. Deterministic packet marking (DPM) is a simple and relatively effective traceback scheme among the available traceback methods. However, the existing DPM schemes inheret a critical drawback of scalability in tracing all possible attack sources, which roots at their <b>static</b> <b>mark</b> encoding and attempt to mark all Internet routers for their traceback purpose. We find that a DDoS attack session usually involves {{a limited number of}} attack sources, e. g. at the thousand level. In order to achieve the traceback goal, we only need to mark these attack related routers. We therefore propose a novel Marking on Demand (MOD) scheme based on the DPM mechanism to dynamical distribute marking IDs in both temporal and space dimensions. The proposed MOD scheme can traceback to all possible sources of DDoS attacks, which is not possible for the existing DPM schemes. We thoroughly compare the proposed MOD scheme with two dominant DPM schemes through theoretical analysis and experiments. The the results demonstrate that the MOD scheme outperforms the existing DPM schemes. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

The evanescent light may be greatly enhanced {{in the center of the}} spot because Sb will transit from a semiconductor to a metal when it is melted under the high laser power irradiation. This local melted area in the spot center may be like a metal tip in the optical near field that can collect and enhance the information that is far beyond the diffraction limit, which leads to the super-resolution recording and readout.

The proposed scheme tries to satisfy per flow end-to-end QoS through control actions which act on flow aggregates in the core of the network.

A Nier-type electron bombardment source is equipped with y- and z-focusing. All source parameters, including the 5 kV acceleration potential, are computer-controlled and monitored by electronic read-backs.

The 40 Ar beam is measured in the high-mass (H 1) detector fitted with a 1011 ohm resistor. The 39 Ar to 37 Ar beams are collected in other Faraday detectors fitted with 1012 ohm resistor.

40|$|International audienceA {{hallmark}} of living systems is {{the management and}} the storage of information through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Although the notion of epigenetics was originally given to any regulation beyond DNA sequence, {{it has often been}} restricted to chromatin modifications, supposed to behave as cis-markers, specifying the sets of genes to be expressed or repressed. This definition {{does not take into account}} the initial view of epigenetics, based on nonlinear interaction networks whose "attractors" can remain stable without need for any chromatin mark. In addition, most chromatin modifications are the steady state resultants of highly dynamic modification and de-modification activities and, as such, seem poorly appropriate to work as long-term memory keepers. Instead, the basic support of epigenetic memory could remain the attractors, to which chromatin modifications belong as do many other components. The influence of chromatin modifications in memory is highly questionable when envisioned as <b>static</b> structural <b>marks,</b> but can be recovered under the dynamic circuitry perspective, thanks to their self-templating properties. Beside their standard repressive or permissive functions, chromatin modifications can also influence transcription in multiple ways such as: (1) by randomizing or inversely stabilizing gene expression, (2) by mediating cooperativity between pioneer and secondary transcription factors, and (3) in the hysteresis and the ultrasensitivity of gene expression switches, allowing the cells to take unambiguous transcriptional decisions...|$|R

The accepted arrivals remain in the system for a random amount of time, where the individual sojourn times are i. i. d.

The latter observation is then exploited to yield straightforward exact simulation algorithms to sample from the steady state distribution. In addition, for the special case where the arrivals are spheres in a Euclidean space that are lost whenever they overlap with an existing sphere, we develop large deviations asymptotics for the probability of observing a large number of spheres in the system in steady state, under diverse asymptotic regimes.

40|$|Investments in one’s health {{require a}} {{comparison}} of the potential benefits and costs of providing either preventive or curative care. While preventive care lowers the probability of falling ill, and is often less costly than curative treatments, it does not provide full insurance against illness. An advantage of curative treatments, while more expensive, is that they do not requiring up-front investment. Focusing on malaria among agricultural workers in Nigeria, we study the benefits of preventive versus curative care. Using a <b>static</b> bench <b>mark</b> model to estimate the expected income to workers from adopting either preventive or curative malaria treatment in one period underlines how the tradeoff depends crucially on the unconditional probability of infection and the effectiveness of the preventive treatment. Focusing on bednet use as preventive measure the results shows that workers only choose malaria prevention when using bednets reduces the probability of infection by 6 percentage points. A dynamic simulation that explicitly takes into account the epidemiological dynamics, modelling the probability of infection as a function of both preventative choices and epidemiological conditions shows higher expected incomes from adopting bednets, but income effects are consistently less than 5 % of a standard deviation of a worker’s earnings. The results also indicate that there are no significant gains to adopting multiple malaria prevention measures in comparison to solely adopting a bednet. The results may be driven partly by low initial adoption levels of prevention which causes infection rates to remain high even if workers use preventive measures. The findings reinforce the importance of vector control strategies to be implemented in tandem with individual or household level preventative interventions...|$|R

The RSRM FSM- 8 static test motor propellant inhibitors (composed of a rubber insulation material) were successfully instrumented with eroding potentiometers and thermocouples.

Normally, pre-fire and post-fire insulation thickness measurements establish the thermal performance of an ablating insulation material. However, post-fire inhibitor decomposition and recession measurements are {{complicated by the fact}} that most of the inhibitor is back during motor operation.

The current condition of the structure is mainly influenced by structural discontinuities introduced at the time of construction, the unintended consequences of repair and modification and the material decay that has affected the base of the rammed earth walls. The overall findings of the static monitoring show that there is no related damage, variations in crack widths are related to the building seasonal cycle.

5000|$|These soils have {{permafrost}} (permanently frozen material) {{within one}} metre {{of the surface}} (2 m if the soil is strongly cryoturbated; i.e., disturbed by frost action). As permafrost is a barrier to roots and water, the active layer (seasonally thawed material) above it may become a saturated, semifluid material in spring. Commonly the permafrost layer near the surface contains abundant ice. Melting of ice and frozen materials, resulting from disturbance of the surface vegetation (boreal forest or tundra), may cause slumping of the soil and disruption of roads, pipelines and buildings.

40|$|Fibrosierende Lungenerkrankungen stellen aufgrund ihrer Häufigkeit und ihres oft therapierefraktären und progredienten Verlaufs ein besonderes Patientengut in der Pneumologie dar. Gerade im Fall der Idiopathischen Interstitiellen Pneumonien besteht derzeit weitgehende Unkenntnis der zugrunde liegenden molekularen Mechanismen. Seit kurzem ist bekannt, dass auch bei fibrosierenden Lungenerkrankungen weitreichende Änderungen des alveolären Gerinnungssystems, mit Hochregulation prothrombotischer und Suppression fibrinolytischer Prozesse, auftreten. Über die intermediäre Bildung profibrotisch wirkender Gerinnungsprodukte (z. B. Thrombin), über die Wechselwirkung mit pulmonalem Surfactant, über die 2 ̆ 7 Verklebung 2 ̆ 7 atelektatischer Lungenbezirke und über die Suppression fibrinolytischer Faktoren könnten diese Veränderungen zur Entwicklung einer Fibrose beitragen. 	 Vor diesem Hintergrund wurde in der vorliegenden Arbeit der Einfluss einer repetetiven inhalativen Verabreichung von Urokinase oder Heparin an einem tierexperimentellen Modell der Lungenfibrose untersucht. Hierzu wurde Kaninchen unter Narkose und mechanischer Beatmung 1, 8 U/kg KG Bleomycin als Aerosol verabreicht. In der Folge entwickelte sich zunächst ein ARDS-typisches Geschen, gefolgt von einer ausgeprägten Lungenfibrose. An diesem Modell wurde entweder in einer frühen (Tag 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) oder einer späten Phase (Tag 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24) jeweils 6000 U Urokinase oder 3500 U Heparin repetitiv inhalativ unter Spontanatmung pulmonal deponiert 	 Durch die Verabreichung von Heparin und Urokinase (wobei die frühe Heparinbehandlung und die späte Urokinasetherapie am effektivsten waren) wurde ein fast komplette Unterdrückung der fibroproliverativen Antwort erreicht. Dieses beinhaltet eine weitgehende Normalisierung der statischen Compliance, eine weitgehende Reduktion des löslichen Kollagens in der bronchoalveolären Lavage und des Hydroxyprolinanteils im Trockengewicht der Lungen. Diese Ergebnisse konnten auch durch die Bildgebung mittels HRCT und Histologie untermauert werden. 	 Diese Untersuchungen stützen die Annahme, dass die Bildung von intraalveolärem Fibrin einen wichtigen Stellenwert bei der Entwicklung der Bleomycin-induzierten Lungenfibrose darstellt. Es kann gefolgert werden, dass die kompartimentalisierte Korrektur der alveolären Gerinnungsbalance durch inhalative Verabreichung antikoagulativer oder fibrinolytischer Agentien einen möglichen Therapieansatz zur Behandlung der Lungenfibrose darstellt. Fibrotic lung {{diseases}} {{represent an}} important field in pneumology, mainly {{due to their}} frequency and often encountered therapeutic resistance and the progressive course of the disease. Especially concerning the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias {{there is a lack}} of knowledge regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms. It has recently been shown that fibrotic lung diseases are accompanied by marked changes in intraalveolar coagulation, with up-regulation of prothrombotic and suppression of fibrinolytic activitis. Through the intermediate formation of profibrotic factors (such as thrombin), the interaction with pulmonary surfactant, the cohesion of atelectatic lung areas and the supression of fibrinolytic factors, these changes could contribute to the development of fibrosis. 	 The present study examined the influence of a repetetive inhalative administration of urokinase or heparin in a rabbit model of lung fibrosis. This was achieved by sedation and mechanical ventilation with 1. 8 U/kg bodyweight bleomycin as an aerosol. In consequence, an ARDS-typical situation developed, followed by a marked lung fibrosis. Either during an early (day 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) or the later phase (day 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24) the rabbits were then repetitively treated with either 6000 U urokinase or 3500 U heparin per aerosol via spontaneous breathing. 	 The administration of both, heparin and urokinase lead to a nearly complete suppression of the fibroproliferative answer, whith the early heparin and the late urokinase treatment being most effective. This included an almost complete normalisation of <b>static</b> compliance, a <b>marked</b> reduction of both the soluble collagen in the bronchoalveolar lavage and the hydroxyproline content lungtissue. The results were confirmed by HRCT-imaging and histology. 	 The present study supports the hypothesis that the formation of intraalveolar fibrin plays an important role in the development of bleomycin induced lung fibrosis. In conclusion, the compartiamentalised correction of the alveolar coagulation balance by inhalative administration of anticoagulative or fibrinolytic agents offers as possible therapeutic option in the treatment of lung fibrosis...|$|R
