50|$|Piretanide (INN, {{trade names}} Arelix, Eurelix, Tauliz) has been {{synthesized}} in 1973 at Hoechst AG (Germany) as a loop diuretic compound {{by using a}} then-new method for introducing cyclic amine residues in an aromatic nucleus {{in the presence of}} other aromatically bonded functional groups. Studies of piretanide in rats and dogs in comparison with other high-ceiling diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide found a more suitable dose/response rate (regression line) and a more favourable sodium/potassium excretion ratio. These findings led eventually to clinical studies in man and finally to the introduction as a <b>saluretic</b> and antihypertensive medication in Germany, France, Italy and other countries.|$|E

The more ef-fective antihypertensive drugs can be included under the following groupings: <b>saluretic</b> agents; rauwolfia preparations; hydralazine; ganglion-blocking drugs; and sympathetic-blocking agents. <b>SALURETIC</b> AGENTS Chlorothiazide and the many varieties of related benzothiadiazine derivatives are used widely in the treatment of hypertension not only for their modest intrinsic antihypertensive effect but also for their ability to enhance the blood-pressure-reducing activity of other drugs.

In a series of rats which had been treated with these <b>saluretic</b> drugs, subsequent adrenalectomy had a similar antidiuretic effect. Chlorothiazide produced little or no further antidiuresis in these adrenalectomized animals, but it prevented the restoration of polyuria which otherwise followed the adminis-tration of adrenal steroids.

40|$|The <b>saluretic</b> {{effect of}} the thiazide diuretics has been {{attributed}} to inhibition of sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron of the kidney. Recent micropuncture studies have shown, however, that chlorothiazide administration can also inhibit sodium reabsorption in the proximal convolution. To clarify the site of the <b>saluretic</b> effect of chlorothiazide, these micropuncture studies examined the effect of chlorothiazide on chloride transport in the nephron. The effect of chlorothiazide on chloride transport was studied because chlorothiazide's effectiveness as a <b>saluretic</b> is largely due to its ability to enhance sodium chloride excretion; if only changes in sodium transport are examined, it would be then difficult to determine if sodium as bicarbonate or as chloride is affected, since chlorothiazide can inhibit carbonic anhydrase. One group of rats was studied before and after 15 mg/kg per h chlorothiazide. For comparison, another group of rats was studied before and after 2 mg/kg per h benzolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Fractional chloride delivery from the proximal tubule was similarly increased in both groups from 59. 4 to 71. 0 % by chlorothiazide administration, Pless than 0. 0001, and from 54. 3 to 68. 2 % by benzolamide administration, P less than 0. 001. The increased delivery very of chloride from the proximal tubule was largely reabsorbed before the early distal tubule as fractional chloride delivery to this site increased only from 5. 08 to 7. 40 % after chlorothiazide administration, P less than 0. 001, and from 4. 50 to 6. 29 % after benzolamide administration, P less than 0. 01. Benzolamide had no effect on chloride reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule. However, chlorothiazide administration resulted in a marked decrease in distal tubular chloride reabsorption, the fraction of filtered chloride present at the late distal tubule incresing from 1. 24 to 6. 25 %, P less than 0. 001. Fractional chloride excretion in the urine increased from 0. 29 to 3. 44 %, P less than 0. 001, after chlorothiazide, but did not change after benzolamide. The influence of chlorothiazide on proximal chloride transport presumably is related to its ability to inhibit renal carbonic anhydrase. However, it is not the effect of chlorothiazide in the proximal convolution but rather its effect in the distal convoluted tubule which is primarily responsible for its ability to be an effective saliuretic...|$|E

Wistar rats kept on fasting for 24 h with water ad labium, divided into normal, positive control and treated groups were orally given normal saline (20 ml/kg), hydrochlorothiazide (HCT; 10 mg/kg) and different doses of the plant material, respectively. Immediately after dosing, the rats were housed in the metabolic cages. The urine was collected at 2 h interval for 6 h and volume, pH and electrolytes levels were measured. Ha. Cr caused dose-dependent (30 and 100 mg/kg) increase in urine output, indicating the diuretic effect. In addition, Ha. Cr increased urine contents of Na+ and K+, suggesting that the diuretic effect is mediated through increased electrolyte excretion. Similarly, the reference drug, HCT (10 mg/kg), increased urine volume and Na+ and K+ excretion. None of the resultant fractions exhibited diuretic effect comparable to that of the parent crude extract. Ha. Hx was devoid of diuretic effect, Ha.

40|$|Ten healthy {{subjects}} received 10 mg oral enalapril (MK 421) {{daily for}} a period of 8 days. Renal clearances of electrolytes, urate and phosphate were monitored and factored for glomerular filtration rate, as measured by creatinine clearance, with particular emphasis on the first and eighth day of treatment. Apart from a fall of around 10 % in creatinine clearance between 1 - 2 h on both days 1 and 8, GFR remained unchanged throughout the study. Fractional sodium excretion increased in a biphasic manner by approximately 50 % over control between 1 - 2 h and 4 - 8 h on day 1. Significant chloruresis (+ 39. 0 +/- 12. 9 %) and kaluresis (+ 26. 5 +/- 10. 3 %) occurred between 4 - 8 h. Urinary pH increased between 0 - 1 h (+ 0. 29 +/- 0. 12; P less than 0. 05), and between 4 - 8 h (+ 0. 50 +/- 0. 08; P less than 0. 01). The biphasic <b>saluretic</b> effect was also seen between 1 - 2 h and 4 - 8 h on day 8. Enalapril caused significant increases in urate and phosphate excretion on day 8 of therapy. There was a biphasic increase in fractional urate excretion at 1 - 2 h (+ 28. 1 +/- 6. 9 %; P less than 0. 05) and at 4 - 8 h (+ 21. 0 +/- 6. 0 % P less than 0. 01). Significant phosphaturia (+ 36. 8 +/- 5. 2 %; P less than 0. 05) was also observed at 4 - 8 h on day 8. Urinary drug excretion was also biphasic; over the first 2 h the predominant drug form was unchanged enalapril, whilst the peak excretion of the diacid metabolite, enalaprilat, occurred at 4 - 8 h.

40|$|Background: The goal of {{this study}} was to develop an in vivo-in vitro (IVIV) correlation, both in men and women, which allows {{constructing}} a model to predict bioequivalence assessments for drugs with narrow absorption windows. Besides, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic equivalences were also investigated. Furosemide was chosen as a prototype. Methods: Twelve healthy Caucasian volunteers (8 women and 4 men) participated in a relative bioavailability study. Two oral formulations [Lasix® (Reference, R) and Furosemide EFA® (Test, T) ] were administered under fasting conditions. Urinary excretion of unchanged drug (PK), and of chloride, sodium and potassium (PD) wasmonitored throughout time. PK and PD parameters were calculated from each respective excretion rate versus time curve. In vitro dissolution testing of both formulations was carried out using the USP apparatus 2 and 4 with fixed and variable dissolution media. Results: T and R could be considered bioequivalent since the 90 % confidence intervals for the T/R ratio of geometric means for the area under the urinary drug excretion rate versus time curve and for the maximum excretion rate were within the 0. 80 - 1. 25 bioequivalence interval. However, T had faster initial absorption and higher levels in women, while R displayed such characteristics in men. Closer IVIV correlations in women were obtained when apparatus 4 with variable biorelevant dissolution media were used [going from fasting state simulated gastric fluid to fasting state simulated intestinal fluid]. Since R had faster disintegration time than T, a shorter stay of R under gastric conditions was required in order to obtain a good IVIV correlation in men. <b>Saluretic</b> effect displayed a typical clockwise hysteresis loop for the PKPD correlation assessed through chloride-versus-furosemide urinary excretion rates. Even though a higher amount of furosemide was excreted with the urine in men, differences in the excretion of electrolytes between sexes were almost negligible. Conclusions: Sex-differences in the gastrointestinal transit of formulations, under fasting conditions, determined the extent and the rate of furosemide absorption. The prolongation of the absorption process by mean of slowing the gastric emptying would make the formulation more effective. The USP- 4 apparatus with variable dissolution media was able to discriminate the formulations even between sexes, becoming a promissory in vitro dissolution testing to predict bioequivalence...|$|E
40|$|The {{flowers of}} the pot {{marigold}} (Calendula officinalis L.) are part of combination herbal medicinal preparations which applied {{in the treatment of}} diseases of the hepatobiliary system, gastrointestinal tract, diseases of kidneys and the urinary tract, such as «Fitonephrol» («Urological tea»). Calendula flowers make a contribution in the total therapeutic activity of «Urological tea» as a component which has anti-inflammatory and reparative properties. As is widely known that phytopharmaceuticals usually combine the variety of therapeutic activity and softness of pharmacological effects along with the absence of a significant number of side effects and contraindications which is extremely important in the treatment of chronic pathologies. The main purpose was to study diuretic activity of phytopreparations of pot marigold. Materials and methods. Investigations of discovering of diuretic action of pot marigold’s phytopreparations were carried out on white rats of both sexes weighing 200 – 220 g (8 sets of experiments). Each experimental group consisted of ten animals. The effect of pot marigold medicines at a dose of 50 mg/kg was carried out background the administered intragastrically at 3 % aqueous load of 4 and 24 hours of the experiment. There are such drugs as a subjects to examination: calendula tincture (1 : 10) (industrial production), calendula tincture (1 : 5) and calendula liquid extract (1 : 2) of 70 % alcohol, obtained at the Department of Pharmacognosy with Botany and Bases of Phytotherapy, at a dose of 50 mg/kg. Animals were housed in the vivarium on a standard diet with free access to water. The day before the experiment the rats received intragastric water load in the amount of 3 % of body weight. On the day of the experiment the animals of the control group was administered water-alcohol load and experienced – intragastrically drug dose of 50 mg/kg in an identical volume of water. As a control was used 70 % alcohol. Animals were placed in metabolic cages on day. Collected urine of rats were examined. Determined excretion of water. The concentration of sodium and potassium was detected by flame photometry (mark PAG- 1) for 4 and 24 hours of the experiment. The concentration of creatinine was detected by colorimetric method (mark CPHC- 3) for 4 and 24 hours of the experiment. The results of experiments were performed statistical on the Mann-Whitney test. Experiments were carried out with all the necessary ethical requirements. Main results. It was found that among the studied drugs on 4 hours of the experiment the liquid extract indicate diuretic properties. Tincture (1 : 5) showed expressed diuretic activity, <b>saluretic</b> and keratin properties. Tincture (1 : 10) had tendency to increase diuresis. Such effects decreased within the day. Conclusion. Preparations of marigold flowers in the form of tinctures (1 : 5) and the liquid extract (1 : 2) 70 % alcohol at a single intragastric administration to rats at a dose of 50 μl/kg reveal a marked diuretic effect, significantly increasing the amount of urine, excretion electrolytes and creatinine relative to the control. In consideration of the fact that preparations of Calendula flowers have antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, the results have a great interest in terms of the complex therapy of acute and chronic kidney and urinary tract diseases.  </p...|$|E
