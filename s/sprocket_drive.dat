History of the collaboration of Brault with Éclair is told here (in French) http://www.horschamp.qc.ca/article.php3?id_article=162#nh15. The design included a camera magazine which not only was back-mounted specifically to distribute a more balanced camera weight across the shoulder for hand-holding, but also included a built-in pressure plate and <b>sprocket</b> <b>drive,</b> which allowed cameras to be reloaded in seconds — a crucial feature for vérité documentaries.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{interest}} of simplicity, all models used a friction-drive transmission. A roller (a metal wheel with a rubber surface vulcanized to increase its grip) on the front sprocket shaft was pressed against the machined rear surface of the engine flywheel, thus driving the sprocket shaft, the drive chains and the rear wheels. Moving the shift lever set the drive roller to various positions on the flywheel, either nearer the center or nearer the edge, effectively changing the [...] "gear ratio" [...] for climbing hills or driving on level roads. Moving the roller past the center point spun it backwards to give reverse gear. The front <b>sprocket</b> <b>drive</b> shaft was free to slide forward and backwards slightly, just enough to allow the roller {{to move away from}} the flywheel. The [...] "clutch pedal" [...] worked differently from most other cars, in that the operator had to hold their foot on the pedal to keep the roller pressed against the flywheel (the catalog claimed that the weight of the operator’s foot was sufficient to provide forward motion). Removing the foot from the pedal allowed the roller to spring back from the flywheel, effectively providing [...] "neutral" [...] so the car could be cranked without moving forwards.|$|E

5000|$|A {{tracked vehicle}} uses a {{combination}} of wheels and rollers, including <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets,</b> idler wheels, track return rollers and road wheels. It is quite similar in concept to a conveyor belt, only instead of a machine carrying objects {{on top of a}} powered continuous belt, it's a machine that moves itself over a continuous belt. In a typical application, power is transmitted to a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> (or <b>drive</b> wheel), which drives the track around its loop. On {{the opposite end of the}} vehicle, there is an idler wheel, which provides a pulley wheel of sorts. On some applications, the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and idler wheel carry some of the weight of the vehicle, for the purposes of this description, we will assume the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and idler wheel are not weight-bearing units, and the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> is on the front (see M4 Sherman for an example). Since the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> can be at either the front (M4 Sherman) or the rear (M1 Abrahms) of the vehicle depending on the design, the idler wheel either carries the track back off the ground and returns it to the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> (rear idler wheel), or receives track from the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and lays it down in front of the road wheels (front idler wheel). The idler wheel is not powered, just like an idler gear. Although it technically reverses the tracks direction (but not its rotation), this has nothing to do with the term [...] "idler"; it is not related to an idler gear other than that they are both [...] "idle", or not doing any work, only transmitting power ("idle" [...] being a term for something or someone who isn't working). The road wheels are a series of non-powered wheels between the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and idler wheel that serve to support the weight of the vehicle (and thus aren't considered [...] "idle", even though they are unpowered). In higher speed applications, such as tanks and other AFV's, these road wheels are typically given some sort of suspension system to ease the ride, increase controllability, and decrease wear and tear. Due to the complications in adding suspension systems to the idler wheel and, in particular, the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> in such vehicles, the road wheels typically carry all of the weight of the vehicle. In low speed applications, such as bulldozers, these road wheels lack any kind of suspension system, as the low speeds don't demand the cushioning. This also allows the idler and drive wheels to carry some of the weight, as their lack of suspension is made irrelevant. Track return rollers may or may not be used, and are simply small rollers which support the weight of the track as it's transferred from rear to front to be laid down again.The track simply provides a solid [...] "road" [...] for the road wheels to roll over on over all surfaces: the road wheels roll the vehicle along the self-created [...] "road", while the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> forces the vehicle forward along the track and lays down [...] "fresh" [...] track. The idler picks the [...] "used" [...] track back up, and returns it back to the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> in the front. This is why an early term for a tracked vehicle was a [...] "track-laying machine" [...] (not to be confused with railroad track laying equipment). Transporting vehicles over muddy ground often required planks or logs to be placed along the track (see corduroy road, plank road). In the later 19th century, inventors figured out a way to make a rolling machine that would lay its own plank road wherever it went, negating the need for farmers to lay down logs in order to traverse muddy areas. Other benefits were discovered later.|$|R
50|$|Chain-drive {{systems such}} as the {{derailleur}} systems work best if the chain is aligned with the sprocket plane, especially avoiding the biggest <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> running with the biggest <b>driven</b> <b>sprocket</b> (or the smallest with the smallest).

In 1982 the engine had the balancing cam <b>sprocket</b> <b>driven</b> rather than chain making the engine quieter and a six-speed gearbox was introduced with an automatic cam chain tensioner. From 1982 Honda reverted to the 21-inch front wheel and introduced the rear single shock suspension, known as the Pro-Link, and a 12-volt system. The 1984-1987 models were equipped with dual carburetors and the RFVC type of engine.|$|R
30|$|The {{loading and}} {{unloading}} detection system mainly detects the position change of the seedling plate from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling plate conveyor belt and obtains the position signal as the action control signal of {{loading and unloading}}. The system includes PVDF pressure sensor, travel switch, limit sensor, and a single lamp. The PVDF pressure sensor is arranged {{in the middle of}} the slot wheel-type seedling storage tray and is in the same vertical plane with the push rod mechanism, which is used to detect whether the seedling storage tray is empty or not. It also lights the single lamp and instructs the start of the <b>sprocket</b> <b>drive</b> motor. The stroke switch mainly detects the displacement of the <b>sprocket</b> <b>drive</b> of the seedling storage tray and determines whether the seedling storage tray reaches the feeding position. Its signal is used to instruct the push rod mechanism to push the seedling tray to the conveyor belt. The limit sensor is installed at the starting position of the conveyor belt, and its signal is used to control the reset action of the pushing mechanism.|$|E

However, it is difficult to adequately control the tensile force, because the brake has a tendency to influence the torque and revolution of the driving motor. We then developed a new driving system which has two motors; one is the main motor for conveying materials and the other is an auxiliary motor which is used to control tensile force and chain slack without influencing torque and revolution of the main motor.
