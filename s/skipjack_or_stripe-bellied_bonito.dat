We investigated whether time-area closures have the potential to reduce purse-seine bigeye catches without significantly reducing skipjack catches. Using catch and effort data for 1995 – 2002, we identified regions where the ratio of bigeye to skipjack tuna catches was high and applied simple closed-area models to investigate the possible benefits of time-area closures. We estimated that the most optimistic and operationally feasible 3 -month closures, covering the equatorial region of the EPO during the third quarter of the year, could reduce bigeye catches by 11. 5...|$|R

5000|$|Insects in {{the family}} Elateridae are {{commonly}} called click beetles (or [...] "typical click beetles" [...] to distinguish them from the related families Cerophytidae, Eucnemidae, and Plastoceridae). Other names include elaters, snapping beetles, spring beetles <b>or</b> <b>skipjacks.</b> This family was defined by William Elford Leach (1790-1836) in 1815. They are a cosmopolitan beetle family characterized by the unusual click mechanism they possess. There are a few closely related families in which a few members have the same mechanism, but all elaterids can click. A spine on the prosternum can be snapped into a corresponding notch on the mesosternum, producing a violent [...] "click" [...] that can bounce the beetle into the air. Clicking is mainly used to avoid predation, although it is also useful when the beetle is on its back and needs to right itself.

40|$|The pole-and-line fishery for {{skipjack}} tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis, was {{the largest}} commercial fishery in Hawaii until its decline in the 1970 's and 1980 's. The development and decline of the fishery were strongly affected by fish availability and marketing.

Availability of large fish subsequently increased, but the fishery continued its decline owing to low profitability and lack of markets.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} verifying whether individual purse seine sets were made in association with a fish aggregation device (FAD) or on an unassociated (FAD-free) tuna school, {{on the basis of}} low intensity catch sampling by onboard observers. The target tuna catch and length compositions and bycatch amounts were analyzed from more than 50, 000 purse seine sets sampled by onboard observers who had, in addition to collecting sampling data on species and size composition of target tunas in the catch, and set-level estimates of total bycatch, also identified the sets as either “associated” or “unassociated”. Classification tree (CT) models were developed based on 2007 – 2011 observer data and tested for misclassification error rates on 2012 data. Two types of model misclassification errors (MCE) are possible: unassociated sets misclassified as associated (termed false positive or Type I) and associated sets misclassified as unassociated sets (false negative or Type II error). A third error measure, overall MCE, is a weighted average of Type I and Type II errors. The classification rules developed on the basis of observer catch sampling tended to be nearly presence/absence, e. g. greater than 99 % <b>skipjack</b> composition <b>or</b> presence of 0. 5 kg rainbow runner, likely keyed by the modest observer sample sizes. Overall MCE rates were 21. 8 % for the initial tuna-only CT model and 14. 4 % for the bycatch-included model. The improvement in overall classification for the bycatch models derived principally from a reduction in Type I errors. The addition of auxiliary non-sampling variables (e. g., longitude, month) and use of more complex resampling extensions to CT modelling led to little to no improvement in MCE rates. We employed our methodology to analyze a particular subset of the purse seine data, i. e., sets from the FAD-closure periods of 2009 – 12. The intent was to determine if MCE rates of these particular sets were greater than the MCE rates found in the more general analysis. Reassuringly, the MCE rates of sets during the FAD closure period were found to be equal, or even a bit lower than MCE rates in the broader analyses based on our best performing model...|$|R
40|$|Anchored and {{drifting}} Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) are intensively used {{in tropical}} tuna fisheries. In both small-scale and industrial fisheries, skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) {{are the main}} targets. The increasing development of this fishing practice by industrial purse seiners has {{raised the question of}} the impact of FADs on tuna communities, as they might act as an ecological trap. This study investigated the feeding habits of skipjack and yellowfin tuna associated with anchored and drifting FADs in the western Indian Ocean. The diet of 352 tunas was analysed taking into account the type of FAD, ontogenetic variations, and the resources richness of the area. Poor-food and rich-food areas were defined according to the abundance of stomatopod Natosquilla investigatoris, the main prey of tunas, on the fishing sites. Diet composition was expressed through functional groups of prey. Significant dietary differences were found between both FAD types, as well as an effect of individual size. Around anchored FADs tuna preyed on diverse assemblages of coastal fish and crustacean larvae and juveniles, whereas a low diversity of epipelagic prey dominated the tuna diet associated with drifting FAD. Compared to anchored FADs, the frequency of empty stomachs was significantly higher and the stomach content mass significantly lower among skipjack and small yellowfin tunas caught around drifting FADs. This was magnified in poor-food areas, where drifting FADs often evolved, suggesting that these FADs could negatively impact the growth of skipjack and small yellowfin tuna. Larger yellowfin tuna exhibited differences in their dietary habits between anchored and drifting FADs, and between poor-food and rich-food areas. However, drifting FADs did not impact them as strongly as juveniles of yellowfin <b>or</b> <b>skipjack</b> tunas. Our study gives new highlights on possible detrimental effects of FAD on tunas, and this has to be considered in future sustainable management strategies of tuna fisheries...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Dec. 27, 2013 - June 27, 2014 Staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen capable of producing enterotoxins causing staphylococcal food poisoning, {{one of the most}} economically important foodborne diseases in the U. S. This pathogen may be introduced to pre-cooked tuna meat used for the production of canned tuna because significant manual handling occurs after cooking of the raw fish to separate the meat from the skin and bones. This study was conducted to investigate the growth and enterotoxin production of five enterotoxigenic S. aureus strains in pre-cooked albacore and skipjack tuna meat held at 37 and 27 °C, the survival of S. aureus in pre-cooked tuna meat stored at - 20 ± 2 °C for 4 weeks and its ability to grow and produce enterotoxins in the pre-cooked tuna meat at 37 °C after frozen storage, and thermal inactivation of enterotoxins in pre-cooked tuna meat at 111 and 121 °C. Frozen pre-cooked albacore tuna (loin, chunk and flake) and skipjack tuna (chunk and flake) obtained from a canned tuna producer were inoculated with five S. aureus strains or highly purified enterotoxins A (SEA), B (SEB), and D (SED) for this study. With an initial inoculation levels of 10 ²⁻⁴ CFU/g, populations of S. aureus in inoculated albacore and skipjack tuna meat increased by > 3 log CFU/g after 6 and 8 h of incubation at 37 °C, respectively. On the other hand, more than 8 and 10 h of incubation at 27 °C were needed to yield the same increase of S. aureus counts (> 3 log CFU/g) in albacore and skipjack samples, respectively. However no enterotoxin was produced in any inoculated albacore <b>or</b> <b>skipjack</b> tuna samples exposed to 37 °C for 12 h or 27 °C for 16 h. S. aureus survived in pre-cooked tuna during frozen storage. With an initial inoculation level of 10 ³⁻⁴ CFU/g, populations of S. aureus in all pre-cooked tuna samples decreased slightly (< 0. 7 log CFU/g) after 4 weeks of storage at - 20 ± 2 °C. However, the populations increased rapidly once the samples were thawed and held at 37 °C. Total S. aureus counts in albacore and skipjack samples increased by greater than 3 log CFU/g after 6 and 8 h of exposure to 37 °C, respectively. However, no enterotoxin was detected in any samples after 10 h exposure to 37 °C. All the samples showed signs of spoilage before enterotoxin was detected. Studies of heat resistances of SEA, SEB, and SED inoculated to pre-cooked albacore and skipjack tuna meat revealed that the heat resistance of SED was stronger than SEA and SEB, particularly in albacore loin, flake and skipjack flake samples. When samples were inoculated with SEA, SEB and SED at levels of 500 ng/g, a thermal treatment at 121 °C for 15 min inactivated SEA and SEB in all samples and SED in albacore chunk and skipjack chunk but not in albacore loin, flake and skipjack flake samples. However, a process at 111 °C, for 60 min inactivated all SEA, SEB and SED in all tuna samples at levels of 500 ng/g. When the pre-cooked tuna meat samples were inoculated with S. aureus at levels of 10 ³⁻⁴ CFU/g, SEA, SEB, and SED were detected in all samples after 36 h of incubation at 37 °C. However, a thermal process of 121 °C for 15 min or 111 °C for 40 min destroyed all enterotoxins...|$|R
