2500|$|The Rivet Chip and Rivet Slice {{aircraft}} {{have been}} used by NASA in support of various research programs. NASA first provided funding to modify and operate RB-57F 63-13501 to support the Earth Resources Satellite Program, with modifications taking place at Fort Worth between 26 September 1968 and 14 July 1969 as Project Rivet Rap. Flying as NASA 925 and known as [...] "ESA (Earth Survey Aircraft) No. 3", the WB-57F was used as a flying testbed for the evaluation of multispectral sensors in a [...] "near-space" [...] environment to collect data to be correlated with similar data collected at low altitude and on the ground. The Air Force contracted with NASA to provide the aircraft on the condition that its sensor package be easily removed to reconfigure the aircraft quickly for its national <b>security</b> <b>mission</b> if necessary. The Rivet Rap was therefore modified to carry aerodynamically faired, plug-in pallets developed by General Dynamics to house both NASA and Air Force primary mission equipment. These pallets fit into the bomb bay and connected with existing electrical and cooling outlets, and had removable operating consoles that could be fitted into the back seat station in the cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War in June 1950 and the passage of the Magnuson Act, the Coast Guard became responsible for the security of all of the nations ports and harbors. Because the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve had been allowed to lapse after World War II, O'Neill called for the reformation of the reserve program to help with the port <b>security</b> <b>mission</b> and Congress granted the funds for training an effective reserve component. Under his direction, 35 Organized Reserve Training Units, Port Security (ORTUPS) were established at larger seaports for security assignments and two Organized Reserve Training Units, Vessel Augmentation [...] were formed at Boston and Washington, DC to train officers for assignment to cutters should it become necessary. While O'Neill was Commandant, the active duty strength of the Coast Guard increased by 6,000 personnel to 29,000 and the reserve strength numbered 8,300. Under O'Neill's stewardship, the reorganization of the Coast Guard started by Commandant Farley was completed; this put into effect a system of comptroller functions that oversaw the financial affairs, centralized record-keeping, and standardized reports and forms. The positions of chief of staff and deputy chief of staff were also established to assist the commandant with the management of the organization.|$|E
