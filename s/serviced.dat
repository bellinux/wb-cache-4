40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the factors behind the recent growth of India''s <b>services</b> sector. The high growth of <b>services</b> output in the 1990 s was mostly {{due to the}} rapid expansion of communication, banking, business <b>services</b> (including the IT sector) and community <b>services.</b> While factors such as a high income elasticity of demand for <b>services,</b> increasing input usage of <b>services</b> by other sectors, and rising exports, were important in boosting <b>services</b> growth in the 1990 s, supply side factors including reforms and technological advances also played significant roles. Going forward, the growth potential of Indian <b>services</b> exports is well known, but the paper also finds considerable scope for growth in the Indian <b>service</b> economy provided that deregulation continues. In addition, the paper shows that employment growth in the Indian <b>services</b> sector has been quite modest, thus underscoring the need for industry and agriculture to also grow rapidly.

40|$|Abstract: In Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) environments, <b>service</b> clients {{interact}} with <b>service</b> providers for consuming <b>services.</b> From {{the viewpoint of}} <b>service</b> clients, the trust level of a <b>service</b> or a <b>service</b> provider is a critical factor to consider in <b>service</b> selection, particularly when a client {{is looking for a}} <b>service</b> from a large set of <b>services</b> or <b>service</b> providers. However, a invoked <b>service</b> may be composed of other <b>services.</b> The complex invocations in composite <b>services</b> greatly increase the complexity of trust-oriented <b>service</b> selection. In this paper, we propose novel approaches for composite <b>service</b> representation, trust evaluation and trust-oriented composite <b>service</b> selection (with QoS constraints). Our experimental results illustrate that compared with the existing approaches our proposed trust-oriented (QoS constrained) composite <b>service</b> selection algorithms are realistic and enjoy better efficiency.
