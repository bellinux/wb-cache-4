Robert Reigle identifies Croatian composer Josip Slavenski's organ-and-violin Sonata Religiosa (1925), with its sustained chromatic clusters, as [...] "a missing link between Ives and [...] Ligeti." [...] Bartók employs both diatonic and chromatic clusters in his Fourth String Quartet (1928). The <b>sound</b> <b>mass</b> technique in such works as Ruth Crawford Seeger's String Quartet (1931) and Iannis Xenakis's Metastaseis (1955) is an elaboration of the tone cluster.

[...] Clusters appear in two sections of the electronic music of Stockhausen's Kontakte (1958–60)—first as [...] "hammering points...very difficult to synthesize", according to Robin Maconie, then as glissandi. In 1961, Ligeti wrote perhaps the largest cluster chord ever—in the orchestral Atmosphères, every note in the chromatic scale over a range of five octaves is played at once (quietly). Ligeti's organ works make extensive use of clusters. Volumina (1961–62), graphically notated, consists of static and mobile cluster masses, and calls on many advanced cluster-playing techniques.|$|E

50|$|In music a cloud is a <b>sound</b> <b>mass</b> {{consisting}} of statistical clouds of microsounds and characterized {{first by the}} set of elements used in the texture, secondly density, including rhythmic and pitch density.

50|$|Antoine Chessex is a Swiss composer, {{saxophone}} {{player and}} sound artist born in 1980 in Vevey (CH). His works assume a wide diversity of forms spanning compositions for ensembles, solo performances, sound installations and transdisciplinary projects.

50|$|The work {{requires}} an orchestra of 61 players (12 winds, 3 percussionists playing 7 instruments, 46 strings) with no two performers {{playing the same}} part.

50|$|Venetian Games {{is usually}} {{considered}} {{the first piece}} of Lutosławski's mature period. Inspired by John Cage, Venetian Games is notable for its use of limited aleatory techniques. In Venetian Games, Lutosławski determined the overall form and harmonic boundaries, yet he left the realization of the exact contrapuntal and harmonic details up to chance in performance. The indeterminate character produces aleatoric counterpoint, which is a type of <b>sound</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E
5000|$|When Westerberg graduated, {{he moved}} away from his anti-war {{aesthetic}} and attempted to explore other types of music unfamiliar to him.

While the sonic and parametrical entities need to be specified for each piece, it is shown that this approach can be profitably applied to the complete Xenakis oeuvre...|$|R

5000|$|Program notes {{provided}} by Ensemble Sospeso describe Atmosphères as the [...] "first major alternative to European serialism: static <b>masses</b> of orchestral <b>sound</b> {{that give the}} simultaneous sense of immobility and motion." [...] On the other hand, a close investigation of Ligeti's relationship to the Darmstadt avant-garde concludes that Atmosphères should [...] "be {{seen as part of}} an evolution within the serial tradition and a response to problems articulated within it, rather than as a break from that tradition altogether". The <b>sound</b> <b>masses</b> in Atmosphères are seen particularly to conform to the serial precepts of Karlheinz Stockhausen’s [...] "statistical form", as exemplified in Gesang der Jünglinge (1955-56) and Gruppen (1955-57).|$|R
50|$|The Polish School (also {{known as}} New Polish School) {{is the music}} of several post-1945 Polish composers who share generational and stylistic similarities. Representatives include Tadeusz Baird, Henryk Górecki, Wojciech Kilar, Witold Lutosławski, Krzysztof Penderecki, and Kazimierz Serocki. According to Polish music scholar Adrian Thomas, Zygmunt Mycielski used the term at the Łagów conference in 1949, and it was later used at the 1956 Warsaw Autumn festival. Their common purpose was in part retrospective, {{reacting}} to socialist realism, and in part speculative. <b>Sound</b> <b>mass</b> and sonorism influenced these post-war composers.|$|E
5000|$|Another notable {{feature of}} this {{composition}} is Lutosławski's hallmark use of a twelve-tone chord. Lutosławski's twelve-tone chords are symmetrical and often use {{a limited number of}} intervals. For example, the woodwind pitches of section A contain 12 notes and exhibit the following intervallic structure from bottom to top: 23222 / 5 / 22232. Thus, such aleatoric counterpoint produces a special type of <b>sound</b> <b>mass</b> in which the full chromatic spectrum is not covered. Rather than a tone cluster, listeners can hear the twelve-tone chords as a symmetrically spaced chord. (Roig-Francoli 2008, 287-91) ...|$|E

50|$|Besides being {{influenced}} by composers such as Varèse and Xenakis who dealt with <b>sound</b> <b>masses,</b> Dusapin’s music also shows {{the influence of}} other musical traditions, including jazz. In fact, he was once a jazz pianist, though up until 1997 he refused to include piano in his compositions. Beginning in the late 1980s with his piece Aks (1987) and continuing into the 1990s, Dusapin incorporated French folk music into his musical language. In Aks, commissioned by the Société des Amis du Musé des Arts et Traditions Populaires, Dusapin immediately quotes a folk-melody, {{but the rest of}} the piece is composed independently from the folk song. Dusapin’s work from the 1990s further illustrates the influence of folk music through its frequent use of drones and use of restricted modes, though most often without obvious tonal centers. Other sources of inspiration include graphic arts and poetry.|$|R
