40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a literature research project that I performed to fulfill my study requirements for both Cognitive Science and Engineering (TCW) and Social-Scientfic Information-Technology (SW!), which I studied at the University of Groningen (RuG). It has been eight years since I started studying Psychology. After the first year, at the end of 1994, I choose to graduate in TCW and SW!. Within TCW, the idea that inspired me is the complementary interaction between Cognitive Science (CS) and Technology: knowledge obtained within CS can be used to solve or guide technical problems, and, on the other hand, engineering techniques can be used to implement and test models within CS. In my opinion, the basis on CS was minimal within TCW. This was due to its more practical approach, thereby emphasizing on the skills needed to design and implement computational systems displaying cognitive capabilities, not necessarily on understanding human cognition. Within SW!, I specialized in Cognitive Modeling, where the emphasis lies on modeling mental functioning based on cognitive theories. Furthermore, the application of knowledge about cognition in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) also formed an important area of interest. This <b>strengthened</b> <b>my</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>background</b> in CS. ...|$|R

My wife and best friend, Heidi, remains my most vocal fan. The joy and anticipation I feel while coming home to you makes it all worthwhile. Thank you for keeping things in perspective. My advisor, Mark Hay, challenged me and provided opportunities for adventure. I appreciate the scientific freedom you offered as well as the occasional kick in the butt. Thank you for taking a chance on a herbivorous Californian five years ago. <b>My</b> committee <b>strengthened</b> <b>my</b> <b>scientific</b> constitution. David Dusenbery’s door was always open and I thank him for numerous, stimulating conversations.

My expertise is on interface-engineering based on self-assembly monolayers, organic thin-film transistors (for instance organic field-effect transistors, electrolyte-gated organic field effect transistors etc.), electrochemistry and atomic force microscopy. Nowadays sensors and bio-sensors are {{a hot topic}} in the scientific panorama, as a result I am involved in an European project aiming at implantable organic nanoelectronics for medical purposes. Work experience Dates From April 2014 up to date Occupation or position held Postdoctoral Researcher, funded by the European project: FP 7, grant agreement n. 280772, “Implantable Organic Nano-Electronics ” (iONE). Principal subjects/occupational skills covered “Organic devices for biomarkers detection” The activity is mainly focused on the interface engineering of organic field-effect transistors.

40|$|The {{interest}} {{in the relationship between}} morality and behaviour is often determined by the {{interest in}} antisocial behaviour, particularly in the prevention of that behaviour or the decrease in the prevalence or seriousness of it. Antisocial behaviour is observable behaviour that directly or indirectly harms others by the transgression of important social or moral norms and includes aggressive and delinquent behaviour (Barriga, Gibbs, Potter & Liau, 2001). The prevention and reduction of antisocial behaviour is an important societal task and morality can be viewed as one of the many possible contributing factors. This perspective is shared by my many colleagues at our department. They are interested in the dynamic and static factors, individual and environmental factors related to antisocial behaviour or, more specifically, that causally contribute to its prevalence. Individual’s morality and moral reasoning in particular, is considered {{to be one of the}} many individual dynamic criminogenic factors underlying antisocial behaviour and, in general, seems to be considered as relatively unimportant. Seldom morality is explicitly operationalized as one of the variables in their research on antisocial behaviour. Depending on the individual quality, morality can be viewed as a protective or risk factor: mature moral reasoning is conceived as a protective factor, while immature moral reasoning is conceived as a risk factor. This view implies an instrumental perspective on morality. Stimulating moral reasoning development towards maturity can be made part of the toolbox of educators to prevent or reduce antisocial behaviour. One can also be interested in the relationship between morality and behaviour because one has an {{interest in the}} meaning of morality for human functioning. To question the relationship between morality and behaviour springs from an interest in the consequences of morality for behaviour. This perspective is characterized by an awareness of the tension between what a person thinks s/he should do and why and what s/he actually does. In many cases there is a gap between moral reasoning and behaviour. Because of this gap, some people have drawn the conclusion that the morals people put verbally forward are superfluous or merely some sort of rationalization. Others have tried to fill the gap, to understand the processes, competencies, skills and circumstances that affect the relationship between moral reasoning to behaviour. This latter perspective is <b>my</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>background</b> for studying the relationship between morality and antisocial behaviour. Our goal is an empirically established theory on the development of moral functioning, including disfunctioning. Characteristics, skills, competencies or processes that are of importance for understanding the relationship between moral reasoning and (antisocial) behaviour are included. With my colleagues and students I have been working on two research questions: (1) What moral processes, competencies and skills are related to antisocial behaviour in children and adolescents? What is the nature of the relationship? What factors do affect this relationship? Technically speaking: what are the mediating and moderating factors? (2) Is it possible by using educational programs to improve these moral processes, competencies or skills to such a degree that antisocial behaviour in children is prevented or reduced? Moderators can also be found when one tries to improve certain processes, skills or competencies. To answer these questions we have carried out cross-sectional and longitudinal survey and intervention research using standardized measures in children and adolescents, in clinical as well as non-clinical groups...|$|R

Using contingent valuation methods, this paper analyzes the relationship between willingness to pay (WTP) and the factors expressed through people’s image of nuclear power plants (NPP), their perception of NPP safety, and how these can be affected by their <b>scientific</b> <b>background</b> level. Results indicate that groups with a high <b>scientific</b> <b>background</b> level tend to have low risk perception level, represented through their image and safety levels. Further, the results show that mean WTP is dependent on <b>scientific</b> <b>background</b> and image levels. It is believed that these results could help decision makers address the mismatch of trust between the public and specialists in terms of new policy...|$|R
