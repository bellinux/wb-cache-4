5|$|The {{record was}} a {{departure}} from Jackson's previous work for Motown Records. Its lyrical themes on the record relate to escapism, liberation, loneliness, hedonism and romance. Several critics observed that Off the Wall was crafted from funk, disco, <b>soft</b> <b>rock,</b> jazz, Broadway and pop ballads. Jackson received positive reviews for his vocal performance on the record. The record gained critical acclaim and recognition, and won the singer his first Grammy Award.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{a wave of}} singer-songwriters {{who drew}} on the introspective, deeply {{emotional}} and personal lyrics of 1960s folk-rock. They included James Taylor, Carole King and others, all known just as much for their lyric ability as for their performances. The same period saw the rise of bluesy Southern rock and country rock groups like the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. In the 1970s, <b>soft</b> <b>rock</b> developed, a kind of simple, unobtrusive and mellow form of pop-rock, exemplified {{by a number of}} bands like America and Bread, most of whom are little remembered today; many were one-hit wonders. In addition, harder arena rock bands like Chicago and Styx also saw some major success.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly a discrete genre known as rock and roll evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music, which came to include diverse styles like heavy metal and punk rock. During the 1970s most of these styles were evolving in the underground music scene, while mainstream audiences began the decade {{with a wave of}} singer-songwriters who drew on the deeply emotional and personal lyrics of 1960s folk rock. The same period saw the rise of bombastic arena rock bands, bluesy Southern rock groups and mellow <b>soft</b> <b>rock</b> stars. Beginning in the later 1970s, the rock singer and songwriter Bruce Springsteen became a major star, with anthemic songs and dense, inscrutable lyrics that celebrated the poor and working class.|$|E
50|$|Göreme is a {{district}} of the Nevşehir Province in Turkey. After {{the eruption of}} Mount Erciyes about 2.6 million years ago, ash and lava formed <b>soft</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Cappadocia Region, covering a region of about 20,000 km2. The <b>softer</b> <b>rock</b> was eroded by wind and water, leaving the hard cap rock on top of pillars, forming the present-day fairy chimneys. People of Göreme, {{at the heart of}} the Cappadocia Region, realized that these <b>soft</b> <b>rocks</b> could be easily carved out to form houses, churches, monasteries. These Christian sanctuaries contain many examples of Byzantine art from the post-iconoclastic period. These frescoes are a unique artistic achievement from this period.|$|R

5|$|The Time of Our Lives is {{the first}} {{extended}} play (EP) by American recording artist Miley Cyrus. The EP was released on August 28, 2009 by Hollywood Records, initially as a United States' Walmart exclusive. With alterations in artwork and track listing, an international edition was issued October 16, 2009. The Time of Our Lives was conceived as a release to accompany Cyrus' newly launched apparel line with Max Azria. The tracks on the EP were primarily composed by John Shanks and Dr. Luke, who also produced their respective cuts. Cyrus co-wrote one out of seven songs on The Time of Our Lives; one is a cover and another is a live rendition. Musically, the uptempo tracks on the record are in the pop rock and dance-pop genres while ballads are largely <b>soft</b> <b>rock.</b> Lyrically, it explores the themes of romantic relationships, among other subjects.|$|E

5000|$|Where a {{hard outer}} layer of <b>rock</b> covers <b>softer</b> <b>rocks,</b> erosion removes the softer {{minerals}} relatively quickly, {{and they are}} washed away from under the harder rock. The harder rocks eventually collapse under their own weight and a crater-like valley structure is formed. In Negev and Sinai makhteshim, the hard rocks are limestone and dolomite, while the inner <b>softer</b> <b>rocks</b> are chalk or sandstone.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the other}} Morros, Bishop Peak is {{primarily}} composed of dacite. About 20 to 25 million years ago, magma welled up underneath {{a layer of}} <b>softer</b> <b>rock</b> and solidified. The <b>softer</b> overlying <b>rock</b> has since eroded away, leaving a distinct rugged shape.|$|R

50|$|A ribbon lake, Lake Washington is long, {{narrow and}} finger-like. Ribbon lakes are {{excavated}} by glaciers. As the Puget lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet flowed south {{near the end}} of the Late Pleistocene, it met bands of harder and <b>softer</b> <b>rock.</b> Erosion of the <b>softer</b> <b>rock</b> was faster and a linear depression was created in the flow direction. When the glacier melted, the lake filled with the meltwater, which was retained by moraine deposits. A dam can also be created by the bands of harder rock either side of the <b>softer</b> <b>rock.</b> There is usually a river at both ends of a ribbon lake, one being the inlet, and the other, the outlet—though in the case of present-day Lake Washington, inlet rivers are located at both ends, with a man-made outlet in the middle.|$|R

50|$|A concordant, longitudinal, or Pacific type {{coastline}} occurs where beds, or layers, {{of differing}} rock types are folded into ridges that run {{parallel to the}} coast. The outer hard rock (for example, granite) provides a protective barrier to erosion of the <b>softer</b> <b>rocks</b> (for example, clays) further inland. Sometimes the outer hard rock is punctured, allowing the sea to erode the <b>softer</b> <b>rocks</b> behind. This creates a cove, a circular area of water with a relatively narrow entrance from the sea.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For {{the time}} being the theory about the failure {{mechanism}} of the <b>soft</b> <b>rocks,</b> mechanical behavior of bolting-grouting support body in <b>soft</b> <b>rocks</b> has not been fully comprehended. The design of the bolting-grouting support is mostly based on experience and by analogy, and the theoretical analysis results are far more different with the practical engineering. To solve the problem, the researches on the bolting-grouting support mechanism of the <b>soft</b> <b>rocks</b> and the interrelationship between characteristic parameters of the surrounding rocks and structural parameters of bolting-grouting support body are carried out based on the nested models of original surrounding rocks and the bolting-grouting structure. The qualitative and quantitative relationship between characteristic parameters of the surrounding rocks and structural parameters of bolting-grouting support is found out. At the same time, it could also provide beneficial reference to the practical engineering design and construction...|$|R

25|$|It was at {{this time}} that the term Cantopop was first coined. The Billboard {{correspondent}} Hans Ebert, who had earlier coined the term Cantorock in 1974, noted a change in its style to something similar to British-American <b>soft</b> <b>rock,</b> therefore started to use the term Cantopop instead in 1978.|$|E
25|$|While the orientalist {{trend of}} the 60s and 70s was by the 80s and 90s largely over, India itself {{continued}} to produce bands in various styles of rock music, from <b>soft</b> <b>rock</b> and roll and pop rock, to hard rock and metal. In the early 1980s, however, rock was largely overshadowed by disco, which dominated Indian pop music up until the mid-1980s.|$|E

40|$|Weathering of <b>soft</b> <b>rocks</b> {{is usually}} {{considered}} {{as an important}} factor in various fields such as geology, engineering geology, mineralogy, soil and rock mechanics, and geomorphology. The problem of stability over time should be considered for slopes excavated in <b>soft</b> <b>rocks,</b> in case they are not protected against weathering processes. In addition to disintegration of material on slope surface, the weathering also results in shear strength reduction in the interior of the slope. Principal processes in association with weathering are discussed with the examples of marl hosted on flysch formations near Split, Croatia...|$|R

The recreation at the resort included two lighted tennis courts and a pool, now the Magnolia Pool, which had three water spouting columns in the shallow portion of the pool. There were also two putting greens at the resort.|$|E
25|$|As disco and funk were {{dominating}} the charts {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, soul went {{in the direction of}} quiet storm. With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from <b>soft</b> <b>rock</b> and adult contemporary. Many funk bands, such as Con Funk Shun, Cameo, and Lakeside would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Teddy Pendergrass, Peabo Bryson, Atlantic Starr, and Larry Graham.|$|E

40|$|The slake-durability test is {{regarded}} as a simple test for assessing weathering of rocks. This simple test has been accepted as a standard test by the Rock Mechanics Society. However, mechanisms into slaking processes have not been fully understood yet as many factors involved in the processes. The current research explored mechanisms performed by the test by conducting a series of slakedurability tests for four types of <b>soft</b> <b>rocks</b> taken from Coober Pedy, South Australia. Results show that the slake-durability index (Id 2) of weathered <b>soft</b> <b>rocks</b> was influenced by the degree of weathering. Distinctly weathered rocks had lower indeces compared to partly weathered rocks. Shapes also influenced the Id 2 of these <b>soft</b> <b>rocks.</b> Different shapes displayed different mechanisms in the slaking processes. Samples that had irregular shapes tended to have a lower Id 2 compared to samples that had rounded shapes. Thus, the slake-durability test might have simple procedures, but it could have complicated mechanisms in slaking processes that contribute to the result of the test...|$|R
