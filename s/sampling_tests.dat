40|$|Since the seventies, several {{reconstruction}} {{techniques have}} been proposed, and are currently used, to extrapolate and quantify eruptive parameters from sampled deposit datasets. Discrete numbers of tephra ground loadings or stratigraphic records are usually processed to estimate source eruptive values. Reconstruction techniques like Pyle, Power law and Weibull are adopted as standard {{to quantify the}} erupted mass (or volume) whereas Voronoi for reconstructing the granulometry. Reconstructed values can be affected by large uncertainty due to complexities occurring within the atmospheric dispersion and deposition of volcanic particles. Here we want to quantify the sensitivity of reconstruction techniques, and to quantify how much estimated values of mass and grain size differ from emitted and deposited ones. We adopted a numerical approach simulating with a dispersal code a mild explosive event occurring at Mt. Etna, with eruptive parameters similar to those estimated for eruptions occurred in the last decade. Then we created a synthetic deposit by integrating the mass on the ground computed by the model over the computational domain (> 50000 km 2). Multiple samplings of the simulated deposit are used for generating a large dataset of <b>sampling</b> <b>tests</b> afterwards processed with standard reconstruction techniques. Results are then compared and evaluated through a statistical analysis, based on 2000 <b>sampling</b> <b>tests</b> of 100 samplings points. On average, all the used techniques underestimate deposited and emitted mass. A similar analysis, carried on Voronoi results, shows that information on the total grain size distribution is strongly deteriorated. Here we present a new method allowing {{an estimate of the}} deficiency in deposited mass for each simulated class.

Best Practice: After <b>sampling,</b> <b>tests</b> described in ASTM D 5603 are run. These tests are: % extractables, ash content, natural rubber (NR) and rubber hydrocarbon contents, % heat loss (moisture) and carbon black content. Two samples per truck load (five skids) are run for percent moisture content and bulk density on randomly selected samples, either sampled by a bagger or Quality Control (QC) person. Percent ash, carbon black, rubber hydrocarbon, and acetone extract are run once/day per shipment of a truck load. These are done according to ASTM D 297. For ambient ground materials, moisture content and bulk density measurements are made on every skid because of possible moisture content variations in feedstock. Particle size and particle size distribution measurements are made by using the Ro-Tap method (ASTM D 5644).

It was also designed to evaluate CREC as an air sacculitis risk factor and to explore the CREC relationship to other air sacculitis risk factors (poultry house temperature, air-ammonia levels, and presence of other diseases). In addition, this study was used to assess a possible role of the broiler-breeder flocks and hatchers in the spread of CREC air sacculitis. Congo red E. coli-associated airsacculitis risk was based on CREC exposure of the chicks in the hatchers. Breeder flocks with greater than 30 CREC colonies/plate from hatcher air <b>sampling</b> <b>tests</b> were placed in the high risk group; flocks with less than five CREC colonies/plate were placed in the low risk group. Increased risks of death due to air sacculitis (RR = 2. 26), and increased death rates due to CREC air sacculitis (RR = 9. 45) in high-risk flocks, identified CREC as an important air sacculitis risk factor. The attributable risk percent of CREC airsacculitis from hatcher exposure of CREC was 89. 4 %, pointing to the hatcher as the source of CREC infection.

Cows averaged 155 d of lactation. Milk production {{at the time of}} sampling ranged from 3. 6 to 26. 3 kg per milking per cow. The somatic cell count of milk averaged 243 x 10 (3) /ml and ranged from 8. 5 x 10 (3) /ml to 3437 x 10 (3) /ml. Total viable bacteria counts averaged 197. 8 x 10 (3) /ml.

Studies were then undertaken to compare sampling efficiencies between liquid spore deposition and aerosolized spores which were allowed to gradually settle under gravity on four different test coupon types. Tests with both types of deposition compared efficiencies of four unique swabbing materials applied to four surfaces with various surface properties.
