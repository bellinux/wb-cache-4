40|$|A {{system and}} method for {{transferring}} live objects, such as chickens, to a shackle line are presented. The system and method include introducing {{a plurality of}} live objects to a <b>singulator.</b> The <b>singulator</b> isolates the individual live objects and places them in a pallet on a conveyor. The system may detect and remove cadavers from amongst the live objects. The conveyor leads the live objects to a grasper. The grasper positions {{the legs of the}} live objects so that a shackler can secure the legs of the live objects with a shackle. The live objects and the shackle are then inverted and passed on to a shackle line. The shackle line may be a kill line buffer or a kill line. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|E
40|$|A new {{operating}} {{approach for}} a previously existing rotary <b>singulator</b> was developed which improves the versatility of the device. This {{was accomplished by}} {{the implementation of a}} modular mechanism that performed the basic functions of agitation, gating, pocket formation, and exit, all inherent in this type of singulation device...|$|E
40|$|Pears {{have a very}} {{sensitive}} epidermis and are prone to signal mechanical blemishes, which result in reduced visual quality and low consumer acceptance. The objective of this work was to identify critical points and the magnitude of impact forces on a packing line at a commercial packinghouse. The effect of injuries on ripening and quality of ´Packham´s Triumph´ pears was also evaluated after cold storage. The packing line was scrutinized on its transfer points, fruit drop heights and cushioning overlays, which allowed to acquire the maximum accelerations on each spot. The maximum acceleration forces were reproduced in the lab with ‘Packham’s Triumph’ pears to evaluate the effects on fruit quality after cold storage. Four critical points were noticed on the packing line: at the transfer from the conveyor belt to the lifting rollers, at the transfer from the lifting rollers to the washing ramp with rotatory brushes, {{at the entrance to}} the <b>singulator</b> at the end of the conveyor belt and at the drop from the sizer to the packing stalls. Ripening of ‘Packham’s Triumph’ pears invariably came about during cold storage, and independently of the imposed impacts. The impacts under the circumstances of the test did not affect the quality of ´Packham´s Triumph´ pears kept for up to 120 days at cold storage followed by five days at room temperature...|$|E
