40|$|In {{the dense}} {{metropolis}} of Tokyo, hundreds of Japanese commit suicide along railway lines each year. Japanese {{use the term}} jinshin jiko, or “human accident,” to describe these suicides – this term is frequently displayed on <b>status</b> <b>monitors,</b> which are seen by millions of commuters as they navigate the delays and challenges of the Tokyo. Based on interviews with young Japanese students, this study seeks to understand how everyday Japanese commuters imbue the ambiguous act of train suicide with meaning. I argue that the everyday reproduction of jinshin jiko “shrouds” the embodied, individual act of suicide within the cultural space of the commute. Here, shrouding refers to the social re-production of train suicide as an everyday commuter event. Commuters utilize cultural scripts of dying to read the shrouded event of jinshin jiko through discourses of social obligation, depression, {{and the role of}} the commuting worker. This thesis contributes ethnographic case studies of mortality confrontation amid the rapidly changing perception and discourse of suicide in Japanese society...|$|E

40|$|A {{new family}} of microminiature sensors and clocks is being {{developed}} with widespread application potential for missile and weapons applications, as biomedical sensors, as vehicle <b>status</b> <b>monitors,</b> and as high-volume animal identification and health sensors. To satisfy fundamental technology development needs, a micromachined clock and an accelerometer have initially been undertaken as development projects. A thickness-mode quartz resonator housed in a micromachined silicon package is used as the frequency-modulated basic component of the sensor family. Resonator design philosophy follows trapped energy principles and temperature compensation methodology through crystal orientation control, with operation in the 20 [...] 100 MHz range, corresponding to quartz wafer thicknesses in the 75 [...] 15 micron range. High-volume batch-processing manufacturing is utilized, with package and resonator assembly at the wafer level. Chemical etching of quartz, as well as micromachining of silicon, achieves the surface and volume mechanical features necessary to fashion the resonating element and the mating package. Integration of the associated oscillator and signal analysis circuitry into the silicon package is inherent to the realization of a size reduction requirement. A low temperature In and In/Sn bonding technology allows assembly of the dissimilar quartz and silicon materials, an otherwise challenging task. Unique design features include robust vibration and shock performance, capacitance sensing with micromachined diaphragms, circuit integration, capacitance-to-frequency transduction, and extremely small dimensioning. Accelerometer sensitivities were measured in the 1 [...] 3 ppm/g range for the milligram proof-mass structures employed in the prototypes evaluated to date...|$|E
40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} {{suggests that there is}} a reciprocal relationship between physical strain and workforce productivity and safety performance. Hence, a monitoring technology able to assess physical strain through the analysis of workers’ physiological parameters may be an important step in improving safety and productivity. However, clear relationships between physical strain, safety, and productivity have yet to be determined. Moreover, previous studies showed limitations regarding the monitoring of physiological parameters. Innovative monitoring devices, called Physiological <b>Status</b> <b>Monitors</b> (PSMs), have overcome the past limitations enabling real-time monitoring of workers’ physiological parameters. Thus, this research evaluated PSM suitability for construction workforce monitoring by investigating the construction industry’s perspective through a questionnaire survey. Moreover, three off-the-shelf PSMs were tested to assess their validity in monitoring physiological parameters during dynamic activities similar to construction workforce’s routine activities. Ten subjects participated in the experiments for a total of over 35 hours of recorded data. This research also analyzed the physical strain vs. productivity relationship by adopting heart rate and breathing rate as predictors of physical strain. Thus, productivity, heart rate, and breathing rate data of nine subjects performing a four-hour, simulated construction task (i. e., over 30 hours of recorded data with sampling frequency of 1 Hz) were used to generate 160 regression models. The analysis of the regression models showed that breathing rate is not a significant predictor while heart rate is a significant predictor with a strong parabolic relationship with productivity. Therefore, this research provides evidence of the physical strain vs. productivity relationship and, for the first time, proposes a mathematical formulation of such a relationship. This research project significantly contributes to the advancement of knowledge about physiological monitoring of workers. The methods and results proposed in this research coupled with concepts of ergonomics at the work place can foster not only enhancements in productivity management, but also improve construction workers’ wellbeing and safety.

The present work introduces a modern reverse osmosis (RO) plant <b>status</b> <b>monitoring</b> unit to monitor different plant parameters in real time and early prediction for faults and maintenance. Developed RO plant <b>status</b> <b>monitoring</b> unit consists of a touch screen-based embedded monitoring unit, water quality sensors (pH, TDS), sampling chamber for controlled water flow, flow sensors, pressure and level sensors. The present system has been developed in a modular fashion so that it could be integrated with any capacity of RO plant units. Developed embedded system monitors various parameters of the plant such as input power, efficiency of the plant, level of input and output water tank and also guides operator with instructions for plant operation. Other than this, a dedicated smartphone app interface has been developed for the operator to acquire data from <b>status</b> <b>monitoring</b> unit, storage on smartphone, and transfer it to the cloud. The developed smartphone-based app also provides facility to integrate plant data with Google map with location information for easy understanding and quick action.
