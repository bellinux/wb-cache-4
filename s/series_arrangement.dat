Methodologies for controlling compressor trains in these arrangements piping layout considerations to be observed is discussed. Surge in centrifugal and axial compressors often manifests itself as oscillations of flow and pressure, as well as related compressor parameters, such as rotating speed. Many of the devices, which incorporate surge detection function, use either the location of the operating point relative to the Surge Limit Line (SLL) or physical manifestations of surge, such as high rates of changes of selected process signals for identifying surge. This paper analyzes surge signatures collected in the field and outlines several approaches to surge detection using a combination of parameters, such as flow and discharge or suction pressure, based on the type of application...|$|R

The power density of the battery was approximately 0.025 milliWatts per cubic centimeter. The battery itself was approximately one cubic inch in volume (16 cm3).

30|$|A {{multi-model}} {{control strategy}} approach, aiming at a PV based DC microgrid, {{which provides a}} high-quality bus voltage regulation despite partial shading problems, is presented and validated by experimental results. Since each PV module has its own converter, the partial shading problem, which significantly impairs power generation in PV <b>series</b> <b>arrangements,</b> is solved by the DISO configuration. The proposed strategy solves problems such as connection/disconnection, and avoids the PV partial shade stress for extreme cases by disconnecting the affected PV module. Moreover, the control strategy, in which only 3 different models were considered, {{has the ability to}} be expanded to more models. The system was tested with load changes, showing stability and maintaining the bus voltage level. Furthermore, it was tested by connecting and disconnecting several PV modules, in which the multi-model control strategy shows an adequate response with a good result of bus voltage regulation. The proposed system is also flexible, providing modularity to connect more PV modules or arrays.|$|R

5000|$|The pre-series set, C0, was {{delivered}} in October 1997, and underwent endurance running mainly between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka until early 1999, including {{a short period}} of testing as an 8-car formation on the Sanyo Shinkansen. New single-arm current collectors were fitted from the start, and these initially featured the distinctive [...] "wine-glass" [...] pantograph shrouds of the 300X train.

50|$|The <b>series</b> <b>{{arrangement}},</b> {{the more}} common arrangement of twinchargers, is set up such that one compressor's (turbo or supercharger) output feeds the inlet of another. A sequentially-organized supercharger is connected to a medium- to large-sized turbocharger. The supercharger provides near-instant manifold pressure (eliminating turbo lag, which would otherwise result when the turbocharger {{is not up to}} its operating speed). Once the turbocharger has reached operating speed, the supercharger can either continue compounding the pressurized air to the turbocharger inlet (yielding elevated intake pressures), or it can be bypassed and/or mechanically decoupled from the drivetrain via an electromagnetic clutch and bypass valve (increasing efficiency of the induction system).|$|E

40|$|Optimal {{operation}} {{of water resources}} in multiple and multipurpose reservoirs is very complicated. This {{is because of the}} number of dams, each dam’s location (Series and parallel), conflict in objectives and the stochastic nature of the inflow of water in the system. In this paper, performance optimization of the system of Karun and Dez reservoir dams have been studied and investigated with the purposes of hydroelectric energy generation and providing water demand in 6 dams. On the Karun River, 5 dams have been built in the <b>series</b> <b>arrangements,</b> and the Dez dam has been built parallel to those 5 dams. One of the main achievements in this research is the implementation of the structure of production of hydroelectric energy as a function of matrix in MATLAB software. The results show that the role of objective function structure for generating hydroelectric energy in weighting method algorithm is more important than water supply. Nonetheless by implementing ε- constraint method algorithm, we can both increase hydroelectric power generation and supply around 85 % of agricultural and industrial demands...|$|R

The group was believed to lack the funds to buy the team outright, but remained in contention as potential minority owner until May 2011, when it pulled out of negotiations. Some members of the Ice Edge group later joined the ownership group led by Canadian businessman George Gosbee who ultimately purchased the Coyotes and kept them in Arizona.|$|E
50|$|A fuze {{assembly}} {{may include}} {{more than one}} fuze in series or parallel arrangements. The RPG-7 usually has an impact (PIBD) fuze in parallel with a 4.5 second time fuze; so detonation occurs on impact, but not later than after 4.5 seconds. Military weapons containing explosives have fuzing systems including a series time fuze {{to ensure that they}} do not initiate (explode) prematurely within a danger distance of the munition launch platform. In general, the munition has to travel a certain distance, wait {{for a period of time}} (via clockwork, electronic or even a chemical delay), or have some form of arming pin/plug removed. Only when these processes have occurred will the arming process of the series time fuze be complete. Mines often have a parallel time fuze to detonate and destroy the mine after a pre-determined period to minimize casualties after the anticipated duration of hostilities. Detonation of modern naval mines may require simultaneous detection of a <b>series</b> <b>arrangement</b> of acoustic, magnetic, and/or pressure sensors to complicate mine-sweeping efforts.|$|E
