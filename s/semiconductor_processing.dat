40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a chip-level post-complementary metal oxide <b>semiconductor</b> (CMOS) <b>processing</b> technique for 3 -D integration and through-silicon-via (TSV) fabrication. The proposed technique {{is based on}} dry-film lithography, which is a low-cost and simple alternative to spin-coated resist. Unlike conventional photolithography methods, the technique allows resist patterning on very high topography, and therefore chip-level photolithography can be done without using any wafer reconstitution approach. Moreover, this paper proposes a via sidewall passivation method which eliminates dielectric etching {{at the bottom of}} the via and simplifies the whole integration process. In this paper, two 50 -μm-thick chips were post-processed, aligned, bonded, and connected by Cu TSVs, which have parylene sidewall passivation. Daisy-chain resistance measurements show 0. 5 - resistance on average for 60 -μm-diameter TSVs, with a yield of more than 99 % for 1280 TSVs from five different chip stacks. Subsequently, the techniques were applied to CMOS microprocessor stacking as a test vehicle. Die-level post-CMOS processing for 40 -μm-diameter via etching, redistribution layer patterning, and chip-to-chip bonding were successfully demonstrated with the real chips.
