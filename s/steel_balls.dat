5|$|Some uses {{of heavy}} metals, {{including}} in sport, mechanical engineering, military ordnance, and nuclear science, {{take advantage of}} their relatively high densities. In underwater diving, lead is used as a ballast; in handicap horse racing each horse must carry a specified lead weight, based on factors including past performance, so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors. In golf, tungsten, brass, or copper inserts in fairway clubs and irons lower the centre of gravity of the club making it easier to get the ball into the air; and golf balls with tungsten cores are claimed to have better flight characteristics. In fly fishing, sinking fly lines have a PVC coating embedded with tungsten powder, so that they sink at the required rate. In track and field sport, <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> used in the hammer throw and shot put events are filled with lead in order to attain the minimum weight required under international rules. Tungsten was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980; the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was, at that time, an expensive metal (triple the cost of other hammers) not generally available in all countries. Tungsten hammers were so dense that they penetrated too deeply into the turf.|$|E

25|$|AWRE's {{trickery}} {{with the}} <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> had other unintended outcomes. Even an event as inconsequential as early morning frost was an issue. Violet Club could be loaded into a bomber {{for up to}} thirty days on standby while parked overnight on a remote base where the bomb could get very cold. If the <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> froze together inside the bomb cavity {{and could not be}} removed, the bomb was useless. AWRE's solution was to fit the bomb with an electric blanket. Because the bombs were armed before flight, the take-off was hazardous; the bombs could not be jettisoned, and landing with an armed bomb on return to base was too hazardous to contemplate. As a consequence, Violet Club could not be used on an airborne alert, or even flown to a remote dispersal base.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a fitness formula which is adopted {{to calculate the}} <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> temperature uniform distribution time in the annealing process, analyses the <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> temperature distribution {{in the process of}} heating. After the heat conduction equation of the <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> is deduced, the spherical bessel function is adopted to solve it. The temperature distribution series solution is obtained. Using this formula, the <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> temperature uniform distribution time of the different radius is calculated in the process of annealing. The result shows that the <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> temperature uniform distribution time is the quadratic function of the <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> radius. The time and radius data is adopted to deduce a second-order fitness polynomial. The <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> temperature distribution is obtained in the different position. The <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> temperature uniform distribution time is calculated by the fitness formula and the temperature distribution series one. The error between them is only 0. 03 %. The fitness formula can be used to calculate the <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> temperature uniform distribution time. The change of the <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> surface temperature is more severe than the internal. It often results in the crack of the <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> in the annealing process...|$|R

To ensure photographing of the whole <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> surface, the six CCD video cameras are used in this system. To overcome <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> surface reflection, the red LED light source is used, and then the real and clear images are got. The <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> surface defect is recognized accurately by means of image recognition technology and image reconstruction technology etc. This method provides theoretical basis and technical support for ball defection and quality classification...|$|R

25|$|In {{the year}} 1890, racing jockeys {{from all over}} the world flock to the United States to take part in the Steel Ball Run— a {{cross-country}} horse race from San Diego to New York City with a prize of fifty million dollars. Johnny Joestar, a former racing jockey who fell from glory after a shooting paralyzed him from the waist down, decides to enter the race after meeting the mysterious Gyro Zeppeli. The <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> that Gyro uses as his weapon of choice have a strange power that made Johnny’s legs twitch for the first time in years, so Johnny insists on following Gyro until he learns the secret of the spinning <b>steel</b> <b>balls.</b> The two men begin as rivals, but they grow closer to one another as they travel through the wilderness and face attacks from violent competitors in the race.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{there are}} several methods for {{indicating}} wear of the <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> and screw shaft components of CNC machining centres. These include wear prediction of the <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> and screw shaft of the ball screw by using the value of backlash. This value, generally, has to be determined using expensive equipment such as a laser interferometer or a ball bar. In {{order to reduce the}} monitoring cost of ball screw wear, especially <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> wear, a new monitoring technique is introduced. This technique was developed from a correlation between <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> wear and the surface roughness of the machined surface of a test piece. In this research, the balls were subjected to artificial wear which were achieved by using a barrel tumbling process. Experimental results indicated that ball wear causes increase in surface roughness of a machined test piece. Employing these results, an equation for estimating <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> wear was developed. Research results also showed that this new technique can reduce monitoring cost significantly compared with the cost of conventional methods...|$|R
25|$|Other design flaws {{centred on}} a {{requirement}} for a strip-down and inspection at six-monthly intervals, this took three weeks per weapon using AWRE civilian staff. The unstable nature of the bomb required that the work be done in-situ at RAF facilities, causing considerable disruption to operational duties. There were three main reasons for the strip-down and these were deterioration of the rubber bag, corrosion of the <b>steel</b> <b>balls,</b> and deterioration of the HE, which was prone to cracking. Replacement of a weapon's HE would cost the RAF in excess of £90,000 adjusted to 2006 prices.|$|E
25|$|Barrel {{burnishing}} {{is a type}} of barreling {{where no}} cutting action is desired. The goal is to reduce minute irregularities and produce a clean, smooth surface. The parts are usually tumbled against themselves or with <b>steel</b> <b>balls,</b> shot, rounded-end pins, or ballcones to achieve this. It is also usually a wet process that uses water and a lubricant or cleaning agent, such as soap or cream of tartar. The barrel is not loaded more than half full and if media is used then a 2:1 ratio of media to parts is maintained to keep the parts from rubbing.|$|E

The interposer, which is oriented front to back in the machine, has one or more short projections (lugs) protruding from its bottom edge. Each interposer has a unique combination of lugs, corresponding to the binary code for the desired character. Each interposer also has a tab that slots in between loose <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> in a race, the size of balls and race selected precisely to leave a total gap barely larger than {{the width of the}} interposer tab, such that only one interposer tab can fit in the free space and thus only one letter can be selected at a time.|$|E
40|$|A <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> {{was dropped}} onto a {{handball}} which was resting {{on top of}} a horizontal Vernier force-plate. The relationship between the impact momentum of the <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> and the impulse on the force-plate was investigated. The measured impulse was found to be proportional to the impact momentum of the falling ball, with the impulse being 2. 3 times greater than the momentum. The impact of the metal ball caused the handball to compress and then bounce up following the <b>steel</b> <b>ball’s</b> bounce. This contributed to the measured impulse being greater than twice the impact momentum...|$|R

He attributed much of the exceptional growth of that year to the boom in bicycling and the consequent demand for automatic screw machines and similar machinery, and commented that he had placed orders for between 15million and 18million <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> and that gas furnaces were selling well. He explained that there was little competition for the imported machinery – not even a manufacturer of chucks, {{as far as he was}} aware – because [...] "English" [...] firms seemed reluctant to even copy US designs, partly because of [...] "the Englishman's desire to have and to embody his own ideas" [...] and to what they perceived to be the high capital costs of setting up production given the price at which US machinery was sold there. A few years later he did just that.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> were {{intended}} to prevent a nuclear detonation even if the explosives fired accidentally, or in any conceivable accident. The ball bearings {{had to be removed}} {{through the hole in the}} bomb casing during flight preparation, and after the bomb was winched into the aircraft. The ball bearings then had to be re-inserted into the lowered and upturned bomb before transport back to the bomb store. Quite obviously, without the ball bearings installed, these weapons were armed and live, and too dangerous to allow to be flown on exercises. Bomber Command exercises demonstrated that flight preparation followed by a scramble take-off could not be reduced below thirty minutes, and on exercises in bad weather and at night a ninety-minute scramble was the norm. At least one accident, dated 1960, was reported in the press when the plastic bung was removed and 133,000 steel ball bearings exited onto the aircraft hangar floor, leaving the bomb armed and vulnerable. The Royal Air Force were so nervous of the outcome of a fire in storage that permission was sought to store the bombs inverted, so that a loss of the plastic bung could not end with the <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> on the floor, leaving the HEU unprotected against a subsequent explosion. Even without the partial nuclear detonation feared by the RAF, there was [...] "a risk of catastrophe" ...|$|E
