Two sets of data are produced, one by a module to filter and transmit the corresponding waveform up to either 10 or 180 Hz (STAFF-SC), and the second by the onboard Spectrum Analyser (STAFF-SA) to compute the elements of the spectral matrix for five components of the waves, 3 × B and 2 × E (from the EFW experiment), in the frequency range 8 Hz to 4 kHz. In order to understand the way the output signals of the <b>search</b> <b>coils</b> are calibrated, the transfer functions of the different parts of the instrument are described as well as the way to transform telemetry data into physical units across various coordinate systems from the spinning sensors to a fixed and known frame.

This paper presents the techniques to characterize soft magnetic materials under 3 D magnetic excitations in detail. Using three couples of excitation coils controlled by a computer to generate the magnetic fields in three orthogonal axes, various types of flux density loci, such as circular or elliptical rotating vectors of flux density with any given orientations in 3 D space, can be obtained. Based on 3 D finite element analysis and a comparative study, a sandwich arrangement comprising a sample, guard pieces, and <b>search</b> <b>coils</b> with double-layer structure was proposed.

5000|$|A more crude <b>search</b> <b>coil</b> {{also called}} {{exploring}} coil {{is also used}} in laboratory experiments in schools to measure the magnetic field in a certain region of space. In this case the <b>search</b> <b>coil</b> consists of a simple wire coil or solenoid connected to a sensitive ammeter or galvanometer.

As the <b>search</b> <b>coil</b> moves the magnetic flux linked with the coil changes. This induces a current in the coil which can be registered on the galvanometer. Since induced current is directly proportional to rate of change of flux linkage and assuming the coil is removed from the magnetic field very quickly, the maximum current measured by the ammeter is proportional to the magnetic field [...] The <b>search</b> <b>coil</b> can be calibrated by repeating this in a known magnetic field.A reference table shows open coil voltage versus magnetic field A/m (or teslas) or short current versus magnetic field.|$|E
