50|$|These {{electrical}} fields {{assist the}} vortices in lifting materials {{off the ground}} and into the atmosphere. Field experiments indicate that a dust devil can lift 1 gram of dust per second from each square metre (10 lb/s from each acre) of ground it passes over. A large dust devil measuring about 100 metres (330 ft) across at its base can lift about 15 metric tonnes (17 short tons) of dust into the air in 30 minutes. Giant dust storms that sweep across the world's deserts contribute 8% of the mineral dust in the atmosphere each year during the handful of storms that occur. In comparison, the significantly smaller dust devils that twist across the deserts during the summer lift about three times as much dust, thus having a greater combined impact on the dust content of the atmosphere. When this occurs, they are often called <b>sand</b> <b>pillars.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Aztec Zone - This is {{designed}} as an ancient Aztec village amidst ruins, with carved <b>pillars,</b> <b>sand,</b> various plants and a sky backdrop; the lighting for {{this part of}} the set is used to depict sunlight, thus can be altered to reflect other times of day. Entry to the zone was originally achieved by rowing along a river, with a tunnel leading off towards Medieval/Ocean and a set of steps to a ledge heading towards Futuristic. The revived series removes the river, having a small waterfall addition instead, added {{at the request of the}} show's producer. Time-keeping is done with water clocks, with each cell's door having a rope bind to lock it up, burlap blinds on both them and their windows. The plants that are used consist of artificial and real-life varieties; the latter being removed from the set outside of shooting, to receive adequate sunlight to keep them alive.|$|R

6000|$|Now {{what was}} God's plan for raising the Jews {{out of this}} cowardly, slavish state? First, and above all, to make them trust in Him. While they were fearing the Egyptians, they could never fear Him. While they were fearing the Egyptians, {{they were ready to}} do every base thing, to keep their masters in good humour with them. God {{determined}} to teach them to fear Him more than they feared the Egyptians. God taught them that He was stronger than the Egyptians, for all their civilisation and learning and armies, chariots and horsemen, swords and spears. He would not let the Jews fight the Egyptians. He told them by the mouth of Moses, [...] "Stand you still, and the Lord shall fight for you," [...] and he commanded Moses to stretch out his rod over the sea. (Exodus xiv.) The Egyptians were stronger than the Jews--they would have cut them to pieces if they had come to a battle. For free civilised men like the Egyptians are always stronger than slaves, like the Jews; they respect themselves more, they hold together better, they have order and discipline, and obedience to their generals, which slaves have not. God intended to teach the Jews that also in His good time. But not yet. They were not fit yet to be made soldiers. They were not even men yet, but miserable slaves. A man is only a true man when he trusts in God, and none but God--when he fears God and nothing but God. And that was the lesson which God had to teach them. That was the lesson which He taught them by bringing them up out of Egypt by signs and wonders, that God was the Lord, God was their deliverer, God was their King--that let them be as weak as they might, He was strong--that if they could not fight the Egyptians God could overwhelm them--that if they could not cross the sea, God could open the sea to let them pass through. If they dreaded the waste howling wilderness of <b>sand,</b> with its <b>pillars</b> of cloud and fire, its stifling winds which burn the life out of man and beast, God could make the sand storms and the fire pillars and the deadly east wind of the desert work for their deliverance. And so He taught them to fear Himself, to trust in Him, to look up to Him as their deliverer whose strength was shown most gloriously when they were weakest and most despairing.|$|R
