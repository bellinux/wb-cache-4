5000|$|A {{straddle}} carrier or <b>straddle</b> <b>truck</b> is a freight carrying vehicle that carries its load underneath by [...] "straddling" [...] it, rather than carrying {{it on top}} like a conventional truck. The advantage of the {{straddle carrier}} {{is its ability to}} load and unload without the assistance of cranes or forklifts. The lifting apparatus under the carrier is operated by the driver without any outside assistance and without leaving the driver's seat.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a methodology {{to design a}} Container Terminal Operation Simulation (CTOS), which simulates the vulnerability of port operations to extreme weather events. In CTOS, an agent based model was built for a container terminal at the Port of Sydney to simulate the operations of port operational assets such as cranes, <b>straddle</b> carriers and <b>trucks</b> to observe the individual and collective behaviour under various extreme weather events using a set of Key Performance Indicators (e. g. crane rates, <b>straddle</b> productivity, <b>truck</b> queue length, yard utilisation). The CTOS {{results show that the}} crane throughput loss due to six hours of heavy rain and six hours of high speed wind (separately) is 13 per cent within a 24 hour period. While high speed wind and heavy rain have the highest impact on the crane throughput, high speed wind and flooding in the port area leads to a backlog in servicing trucks. Using a single terminal for the purpose of the simulation, as opposed to the entire Sydney Port, is a limitation. However, the CTOS is designed and coded in a manner that permits its modification such that it can be applied to other port contexts. CTOS offers a versatile tool for port authority to enable estimating performance implications of extreme weather-related disruptions to port operations. CTOS provides an effective proof of concept prototype where the system architecture can be reused in developing an open generic port operations model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a petri net model for examining effectiveness of straddle carrier direct-system operation. A schematic process of straddle carrier operation {{is given by}} formalization of operation type and its motion sequences. An interchange model is proposedto represent transloading process that controls the flow of containers between container handling equipment. Simulation platform was developed to examine the deployment scenarios, which {{is related to the}} number of operating gantry cranes, <b>straddle</b> carriers and <b>truck</b> slots at transfer point. The simulation results suggest the trade-off between operational efficiency and service quality by deployment combinations of cargo handling equipment which is valuable for decision support in terminal managementsystem aiming for operation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”The CALAS project {{consists}} in a laser measure system allowing to localize precisely straddle carriers {{in a container}} terminal. The information given by such a tool makes an optimization possible. In fact, a box terminal is an open system subject to dynamics, in which many events can occur. Among others, they concern container arrivals and departures. Within the terminal, <b>straddle</b> carriers are <b>trucks</b> which are able to carry one container {{at a time in}} order to move it through the terminal. We aim to optimize the straddle carrier handling in order to improve the terminal management. Moreover, missions come into the system in an unpredictable way and straddle carriers are handled by humans. They can choose to follow the schedule or not. For these reasons, the exact state of the system is unknown. The optimization process that we try to build must be fail-safe and adaptive. In this context, we propose an approach usin...|$|R

In this context, we propose an approach using a meta-heuristic based on Ant Colony to resolve the problem of assigning missions to straddle carriers. We built a simulator which is able to test and to compare different scheduling policies...|$|R
