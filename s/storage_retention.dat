Soil moisture readings were taken periodically throughout the winter of 1966 - 1967. Soil moisture recharge begins in October and continues until May. The period of most rapid increase in recharge is between February and May.

Deep soils and high infiltration capacities prevent surface runoff from the area. Both detention <b>storage</b> and <b>retention</b> <b>storage</b> capacity of the soils are high.

The retention or enhancement of ecosystem services may be a benefit of land conservation, but that {{has been difficult to}} document. The InVEST toolset provides a practical, low-cost approach to quantifying ecosystem services. Using the toolset, we investigated the provision of ecosystem services in Sonoma County, California, and addressed three related questions. First, do lands protected by the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District (a publicly funded land conservation program) have higher values for four ecosystem services — carbon <b>storage,</b> sediment <b>retention,</b> nutrient retention and water yield — than other properties? Second, how do the correlations among these services differ across protected versus non-protected properties? Third, what are {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} using the InVEST toolset to quantify ecosystem services at the county scale? We found that District lands have higher service values for carbon <b>storage,</b> sediment <b>retention</b> and water yield than adjacent properties and properties that have been developed to more intensive uses in the last 10 years. Correlations among the ecosystem services differed greatly across land-use categories, and these differences were driven by a combination of soil, slope and land use. While InVEST provided a low-cost, clearly documented way to evaluate ecosystem services at the county scale, there is no ready way to validate the results...|$|R

40|$|The {{current state}} of {{knowledge}} concerning infantile amnesia is presented. A brief overview of the developmental neuroscience relevant to early memory development is presented first. Because regions relevant to episodic memory (hippocampus and parahippocampal areas) have {{a high degree of}} overlap between human and nonhuman animals in their development, anatomy, and function, it is argued that episodic memory may exist across a number of species. If one of the hallmarks of episodic memory is faster forgetting of information in immature than more mature members of the species, then it is likely that infantile amnesia may be species invariant. Following this line of reasoning, the literature on human and nonhuman animal infantile amnesia is reviewed. It is argued that an adequate theory of infantile amnesia must account for the entire literature, human and nonhuman animal alike. A theory of this sort is presented, one that emphasizes the continuity of basic memory processes (encoding, <b>storage,</b> <b>retention,</b> and retrieval) across species and development and that capitalizes on changes in knowledge structures unique to different species, ones that may be controlled by across-species variation in the neocortical areas that modulate input and output to the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions...|$|E

A descriptive survey was adopted with simple percentage analysis. 50 respondents were selected from two state hospitals in Osun State Nigeria. 50 copies of questionnaire was administered and 46 copies of questionnaire were returned with a response rate of 92 %. The findings revealed that lack of uniform retention policy, absence of legal authority on disposal records and document, lack of funds to purchase standard filing shelves and cabinets, and lack of attention by the hospital managements was responsible for misfiling, mislaying, overcrowding and reduced storage space in the state hospitals. It was recommended that legal authority should be instituted nationwide to support records retention and disposal schedules and archive documents for effective and efficient record management in secondary health care delivery system in Nigeria. 1...|$|E
40|$|Background Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used devices in asthma treatment in the Nordic countries. As new DPIs become available, patients are likely to be exposed to more than one type of device, with variable optimal handling. The aim was to examine real life <b>storage</b> and <b>retention</b> of multidose DPIs in patients with asthma. Methods This patient-reported survey on real life <b>storage</b> and <b>retention</b> of DPIs included asthma patients using multidose DPIs. Basic patient characteristics, information on inhaler use and storage, check of expiry date, and concurrent inhaler use was examined using an on line questionnaire. Results A total of 738 patients were included with a median age of 41 years, out of which 83 % were women. Sixty-three per cent reported storage conditions pre-defined as risk locations for their maintenance inhaler and 38 % of the responding patients had more than one maintenance inhaler in use at the same time. Two thirds of the study population checked inhaler expiry date less than monthly or not at all. Use after expiry date was frequently reported. Two thirds of the patients had not received information on DPI storage, either from their doctor and/or nurse or at the pharmacy. Conclusions This patient reported survey indicates that two thirds of the patients store their inhaler devices in suboptimal conditions, and only a minority had received instruction regarding inhaler handling. Non awareness of inhalers’ expiry dates and use of more than one maintenance inhaler simultaneously was common. As inhaler mishandling may impact device functionality, improved communication and patient education is needed...|$|R

Still, a prediction of a karst river’s seasonal discharge distribution is generally very challenging and requires a reliable database, which is commonly not given in such remote areas due to lacking discharge measurements in underground drainage systems. In addition, information about influencing factors to the rivers’ flow rate is mostly also not available or incomplete, e.g., referring to the annual precipitation rate, its temporal and spatial fluctuation, geologic information resp. hydrogeological boundary conditions of the karst underground, etc. (Oberle 2011).|$|R

40|$|Baseflow is an {{important}} component in hydrological modeling. Complex streamflow recession process complicates the baseflow simulation. In order to simulate the snow and/or glacier melt dominated streamflow receding quickly during high-flow period but very slowly during the low-flow period in rivers in arid and cold Northwest China, the current one-reservoir baseflow approach in SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) model was extended by adding a slow reacting reservoir and applied to the Manas River basin in Tianshan Mountains. Meanwhile, a digital filter program was employed to separate baseflow from streamflow records for comparisons. Results indicated that the two-reservoir method yielded much better results than the one-reservoir one in reproducing streamflow processes, and the low-flow estimation was improved markedly. Nash-Sutcliff efficiency values at the calibration and validation stages are 0. 68 and 0. 62 for the one-reservoir case, and 0. 76 and 0. 69 for the two-reservoir case, respectively. The filter-based method estimated the baseflow index as 0. 60, while the model-based as o. 45. The filter-based baseflow responds almost immediately to surface runoff occurrence at onset of rising limb, while the model-based with a delay. In consideration of watershed surface <b>storage</b> <b>retention</b> and soil freezing/thawing effects on infiltration and recharge during initial snowmelt season, a delay response is considered to be more reasonable. However, a more detailed description of freezing/thawing processes should be included in soil modules so as to determine recharge to aquifer during these processes, and thus an accurate onset point of rising limb of the simulated baseflow...|$|E
