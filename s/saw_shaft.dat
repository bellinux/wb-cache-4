60|$|They {{had covered}} {{about half the}} {{distance}} when they <b>saw</b> a <b>shaft</b> of light shoot around the treetops near them.|$|R
60|$|And then, as Dave's torch gave a final flicker {{and went}} out, our hero <b>saw</b> a <b>shaft</b> of light move over the rocks above his head.|$|R
60|$|Larry swept {{his glance}} towards the house, and <b>saw</b> a <b>shaft</b> of {{radiance}} stream {{out as the}} great door opened. Then, he heard Flora Schuyler's voice, and, leaning downwards from the saddle, grasped both the girl's hands.|$|R
60|$|Even as he spoke, we <b>saw</b> a long <b>shaft</b> {{of yellow}} light {{streaming}} from an unknown centre, and searching out {{the recesses of}} the cavern.|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly, most holy father," [...] said Little John, [...] "I am more thankful than e'er I was {{in all my}} {{life before}} that our good friend Scarlet knew thee and thy dogs. I tell thee seriously that I felt my heart crumble away from me when I <b>saw</b> my <b>shaft</b> so miss its aim, and those great beasts of thine coming {{straight}} at me." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{first they}} could find no further opening, but then Dick <b>saw</b> a thin <b>shaft</b> of light coming from a corner. Here there was a flat rock which was easily pulled aside. A broad opening led upward to the outer world.|$|R
60|$|Nor was I wrong. At {{the bottom}} of the runway, or rather at the landing on the floor below, I <b>saw</b> that the <b>shaft</b> descended into the pits beneath, and as I glanced down the {{flickering}} light of a torch revealed the presence of the three I was trailing.|$|R
50|$|The main {{concentration}} of machinery and concrete foundations are located {{to the northwest}} of the site, about 40-60 metres southwest of the current Gulf Developmental Road. However, {{there are a number}} of shafts, most of which have filled with water, and one which is timbered with sawn hardwood, situated on the southern side of the former Gulf Developmental Road. The use of sawn timber to line the shaft is rare on the former Croydon goldfield; most timbered shafts in the area used locally cut sapling logs. Surviving <b>sawn</b> timber <b>shaft</b> linings are rare in Queensland.|$|R
60|$|Later, when shadows {{began to}} gather in the valley and the lofty peaks above were gold in the sunset glow, Withers left camp {{to look after the}} straying mustangs, and Shefford strolled to and fro under the cedars. The lights and shades in the Sagi that first night had moved him to {{enthusiastic}} watchfulness, but here they were so weird and beautiful that he was enraptured. He actually <b>saw</b> great <b>shafts</b> of gold and shadows of purple streaming from the peaks down into the valley. It was day on the heights and twilight in the valley. The swiftly changing colors were like rainbows.|$|R
60|$|She heard, but did {{not notice}} the click of the door. Suddenly she started. She <b>saw,</b> in the <b>shaft</b> of ruddy, copper-coloured light near her, {{the face of a}} man. It was gleaming like fire, {{watching}} her, waiting for her to be aware. It startled her terribly. She {{thought she was going to}} faint. All her suppressed, subconscious fear sprang into being, with anguish.|$|R
6000|$|I {{would have}} spoken, but she {{prevented}} me; {{and her father}} {{stood for a moment}} speechless with astonishment. Grace was a dutiful daughter, and, though he must have tried her patience hardly now and then, I fancied that {{this was the first time}} she had ever openly defied him; while I <b>saw</b> that the <b>shaft</b> had gone home. Colonel Carrington was not, however, to be shaken into any exhibition of feeling, for he turned to me with his usual chilliness: ...|$|R
50|$|With 10 {{minutes before}} the LOI-1, the crew began one last check of the {{spacecraft}} systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place. At that time, they finally got their first glimpses of the Moon. They had been flying over the unlit side, and it was Lovell who <b>saw</b> the first <b>shafts</b> of sunlight obliquely illuminating the lunar surface. The LOI burn was only two minutes away, so the crew had little time to appreciate the view.|$|R
60|$|In 1122, Henry the II., marching into Powys-Land to chastise Meredith ap Blethyn {{and certain}} rebels, in passing a defile, {{was struck by}} an arrow on the breast. Repelled by the {{excellence}} of his breast-plate, the shaft fell to the ground. When the King felt the blow, and <b>saw</b> the <b>shaft,</b> he swore his usual oath, {{by the death of}} our Lord, that the arrow came not from a Welsh but an English bow; and, influenced by this belief hastily {{put an end to the}} war.] Under cover, however, of their discharge of arrows, two very strong bodies of Welsh attempted to carry the outer defences of the castle by storm. They had axes to destroy the palisades, then called barriers; faggots to fill up the external ditches; torches to set fire to aught combustible which they might find; and, above all, ladders to scale the walls.|$|R
5000|$|According to the ethnologist and {{historian}} Kustaa Vilkuna, the main factor connecting the Finnish horse driving {{culture is the}} shaft bow, and the first records of shaft bow usage are from Finland and Estonia. In the ancient cantos and the Kalevala the shaft bow is very commonplace, and the first literary record of the shaft bow is from the 1430s, in the death-lay of Bishop Henry. The first Estonian record is from 1494. Records from Russia occur at a later date. Shaft bows appear in Russian trade inventories in the 17th century. [...] They appear in Sweden later yet - [...] the Swedish explorer and naturalist Carl von Linn√© only <b>saw</b> his first <b>shaft</b> bow in Finland in 1732.|$|R
50|$|The windshaft {{also carries}} the brake wheel which has 70 cogs. This drives the conical lantern pinion wallower (38 staves)at {{the top of}} the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel drives four pairs of millstones. Two pairs are used for making flour and two pairs are used to produce pearl barley. The flour stones are each driven by a stone nut with 30 staves and the pearl barley stones are each driven by a stone nut with 20 staves. A lantern pinion with 35 staves drives carries the drive to the <b>saw</b> via a <b>shaft.</b> At the {{opposite}} end of this shaft, a gear with 35 cogs drives a wallower with 44 cogs. This drives a gear with 26 cogs which drives another gear with 51 cogs on the axle of the frame saw.|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} with the {{children}} already {{on their way to}} their next destination. They have to find a bend in a river in the shape of an M. The River is in a northerly direction from their camp, and as they are flying, they see a bush fire in the distance and some people in distress. They land and rescue {{a man and a woman}} and some small animals. The woman is desperate for them to go after her daughter, who has left the farm in search of her horse Victory Stride. After dropping them off at the nearby town of Rivers Bend, the children search for Alice, the missing girl. They find her, and Carmen helps her by staying with her whilst the Poopmobile gives them directions from above. They escape the fire, and Sparks, back at Secret Valley, helps the situation by warning the nearby towns of Rivers Bend's distress. He also discovers the location of the salamander inadvertently, and is able to pass the information to the Doctor. The latest salamander has been attached to the Jambaroo Shield, a trophy which is to be presented to the winner of a horse race called the Jambaroo Shield stakes. The children decide to enter the race with Victory Stride as their champion, but he needs a trainer.Dingle has been sent to buy all the other horses off; Sator wants to win the race for himself. He purchases a horse called Black Eye, and a jockey. Dingle then keeps an eye on the children and sees them searching for the mineral along the river.It transpires that old Sid Chesney, a horse-trainer the children have been able to persuade to train their horse, also knows of the whereabouts of the fifth mineral, for he was the person who found the Salamander originally. After they have the mineral safely in their possession, they are about to go to the race when they find that their bus has been sabotaged by Murk who has <b>sawn</b> the drive <b>shaft</b> through. Race day arrives and Sator is filled with rage to see the Poopmobile flying to the race course, with Victory Stride slung underneath it. Sid Chesney has trained the horse well, and although Alice cannot ride it herself, because of an accident, Jamie has been prepared for the ordeal.The race begins, and Dingle tries to send Jamie in a different direction by planting a confusing sign on the course. Sators jockey throws dirt in Jamie's face, and tries to push him from the horse. But Jamie hangs on, and even though Sator has planted a fresh horse on the track, Jamie still wins the race, with a little last moment help from Sid. The Salamander is theirs, but they are horrified to find that there is no cryptogram on it. And to make matters worse, Dingle has planted a vision bug on the Poopmobile which even Matt is unaware of.|$|R
6000|$|We {{turned to}} go, but Cyril took the child, [...] And held her round the knees against his waist, [...] And blew the swollen cheek of a trumpeter, [...] While Psyche watched them, smiling, {{and the child}} [...] Pushed her flat hand against his face and laughed; [...] And thus our conference closed. [...] And then we strolled [...] For half the day through stately theatres [...] Benched crescent-wise. In each we sat, we heard [...] The grave Professor. On the lecture slate [...] The circle rounded under female hands [...] With {{flawless}} demonstration: followed then [...] A classic lecture, rich in sentiment, [...] With scraps of thunderous Epic lilted out [...] By violet-hooded Doctors, elegies [...] And quoted odes, and jewels five-words-long [...] That on the stretched forefinger of all Time [...] Sparkle for ever: then we dipt in all [...] That treats of whatsoever is, the state, [...] The total chronicles of man, the mind, [...] The morals, something of the frame, the rock, [...] The star, the bird, the fish, the shell, the flower, [...] Electric, chemic laws, and all the rest, [...] And whatsoever can be taught and known; [...] Till like three horses that have broken fence, [...] And glutted all night long breast-deep in corn, [...] We issued gorged with knowledge, and I spoke: [...] 'Why, Sirs, they do all this as well as we.' [...] 'They hunt old trails' said Cyril 'very well; [...] But when did woman ever yet invent?' [...] 'Ungracious!' answered Florian; 'have you learnt [...] No more from Psyche's lecture, you that talked [...] The trash that made me sick, and almost sad?' [...] 'O trash' he said, 'but with a kernel in it. [...] Should I not call her wise, who made me wise? [...] And learnt? I learnt more from her in a flash, [...] Than in my brainpan were an empty hull, [...] And every Muse tumbled a science in. [...] A thousand hearts lie fallow in these halls, [...] And round these halls a thousand baby loves [...] Fly twanging headless arrows at the hearts, [...] Whence follows many a vacant pang; but O [...] With me, Sir, entered in the bigger boy, [...] The Head of all the golden-shafted firm, [...] The long-limbed lad that had a Psyche too; [...] He cleft me through the stomacher; and now [...] What think you of it, Florian? do I chase [...] The substance or the shadow? will it hold? [...] I have no sorcerer's malison on me, [...] No ghostly hauntings like his Highness. I [...] Flatter myself that always everywhere [...] I know the substance when I see it. Well, [...] Are castles shadows? Three of them? Is she [...] The sweet proprietress a shadow? If not, [...] Shall those three castles patch my tattered coat? [...] For dear are those three castles to my wants, [...] And dear is sister Psyche to my heart, [...] And two dear things are one of double worth, [...] And much I might have said, but that my zone [...] Unmanned me: then the Doctors! O to hear [...] The Doctors! O to watch the thirsty plants [...] Imbibing! once or twice I thought to roar, [...] To break my chain, to shake my mane: but thou, [...] Modulate me, Soul of mincing mimicry! [...] Make liquid treble of that bassoon, my throat; [...] Abase those eyes that ever loved to meet [...] Star-sisters answering under crescent brows; [...] Abate the stride, which speaks of man, and loose [...] A flying charm of blushes o'er this cheek, [...] Where they like swallows coming out of time [...] Will wonder why they came: but hark the bell [...] For dinner, let us go!' [...] And in we streamed [...] Among the columns, pacing staid and still [...] By twos and threes, till all {{from end to end}} [...] With beauties every shade of brown and fair [...] In colours gayer than the morning mist, [...] The long hall glittered like a bed of flowers. [...] How might a man not wander from his wits [...] Pierced through with eyes, but that I kept mine own [...] Intent on her, who rapt in glorious dreams, [...] The second-sight of some Astr√¶an age, [...] Sat compassed with professors: they, the while, [...] Discussed a doubt and tost it to and fro: [...] A clamour thickened, mixt with inmost terms [...] Of art and science: Lady Blanche alone [...] Of faded form and haughtiest lineaments, [...] With all her autumn tresses falsely brown, [...] Shot sidelong daggers at us, a tiger-cat [...] In act to spring. [...] At last a solemn grace [...] Concluded, and we sought the gardens: there [...] One walked reciting by herself, and one [...] In this hand held a volume as to read, [...] And smoothed a petted peacock down with that: [...] Some to a low song oared a shallop by, [...] Or under arches of the marble bridge [...] Hung, shadowed from the heat: some hid and sought [...] In the orange thickets: others tost a ball [...] Above the fountain-jets, and back again [...] With laughter: others lay about the lawns, [...] Of the older sort, and murmured that their May [...] Was passing: what was learning unto them? [...] They wished to marry; they could rule a house; [...] Men hated learned women: but we three [...] Sat muffled like the Fates; and often came [...] Melissa hitting all we <b>saw</b> with <b>shafts</b> [...] Of gentle satire, kin to charity, [...] That harmed not: then day droopt; the chapel bells [...] Called us: we left the walks; we mixt with those [...] Six hundred maidens clad in purest white, [...] Before two streams of light from wall to wall, [...] While the great organ almost burst his pipes, [...] Groaning for power, and rolling through the court [...] A long melodious thunder to the sound [...] Of solemn psalms, and silver litanies, [...] The work of Ida, to call down from Heaven [...] A blessing on her labours for the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "WILLIS, I didn't {{want you}} here to-day: [...] The lawyer's coming for the company. [...] I'm {{going to sell}} my soul, or, rather, feet. [...] Five hundred dollars for the pair, you know." [...] "With you the feet have nearly been the soul; [...] And if you're going to sell them to the devil, [...] I {{want to see you}} do it. When's he coming?" [...] "I half suspect you knew, and came on purpose [...] To try to help me drive a better bargain." [...] "Well, if it's true! Yours are no common feet. [...] The lawyer don't know what it is he's buying: [...] So many miles you might have walked you won't walk. [...] You haven't run your forty orchids down. [...] What does he think?--How are the blessed feet? [...] The doctor's sure you're going to walk again?" [...] "He thinks I'll hobble. It's both legs and feet." [...] "They must be terrible--I mean to look at." [...] "I haven't dared to look at them uncovered. [...] Through the bed {{blankets}} I remind myself [...] Of a starfish laid out with rigid points." [...] "The wonder is it hadn't been your head." [...] "It's hard to tell you how I managed it. [...] When I <b>saw</b> the <b>shaft</b> had me by the coat, [...] I didn't try too long to pull away, [...] Or fumble for my knife to cut away, [...] I just embraced the shaft and rode it out-- [...] Till Weiss shut off the water in the wheel-pit. [...] That's how I think I didn't lose my head. [...] But my legs got their knocks against the ceiling." [...] "Awful. Why didn't they throw off the belt [...] Instead of going clear down in the wheel-pit?" [...] "They say some time was wasted on the belt-- [...] Old streak of leather--doesn't love me much [...] Because I make him spit fire at my knuckles, [...] The way Ben Franklin used to make the kite-string. [...] That must be it. Some days he won't stay on. [...] That day a woman couldn't coax him off. [...] He's on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth [...] Snatched right and left across the silver pulleys. [...] Everything goes the same without me there. [...] You can hear the small buzz saws whine, the big saw [...] Caterwaul to the hills around the village [...] As they both bite the wood. It's all our music. [...] One ought as a good villager to like it. [...] No doubt it has a sort of prosperous sound, [...] And it's our life." [...] "Yes, when it's not our death." [...] "You make that sound as if it wasn't so [...] With everything. What we live by we die by. [...] I wonder where my lawyer is. His train's in. [...] I want this over with; I'm hot and tired." [...] "You're getting ready to do something foolish." [...] "Watch for him, will you, Will? You let him in. [...] I'd rather Mrs. Corbin didn't know; [...] I've boarded here so long, she thinks she owns me. [...] You're bad enough to manage without her." [...] "And I'm going to be worse instead of better. [...] You've got to tell me how far this is gone: [...] Have you agreed to any price?" [...] "Five hundred. [...] Five hundred--five--five! One, two, three, four, five. [...] You needn't look at me." [...] "I don't believe you." [...] "I told you, Willis, when you first came in. [...] Don't you be hard on me. I have to take [...] What I can get. You see they have the feet, [...] Which gives them the advantage in the trade. [...] I can't get back the feet in any case." [...] "But your flowers, man, you're selling out your flowers." [...] "Yes, that's one way to put it--all the flowers [...] Of every kind everywhere in this region [...] For the next forty summers--call it forty. [...] But I'm not selling those, I'm giving them, [...] They never earned me so much as one cent: [...] Money can't pay me for the loss of them. [...] No, the five hundred was the sum they named [...] To pay the doctor's bill and tide me over. [...] It's that or fight, and I don't want to fight-- [...] I just want to get settled in my life, [...] Such as it's going to be, and know the worst, [...] Or best--it may not be so bad. The firm [...] Promise me all the shooks I want to nail." [...] "But what about your flora of the valley?" [...] "You have me there. But that--you didn't think [...] That was worth money to me? Still I own [...] It goes against me not to finish it [...] For the friends it might bring me. By the way, [...] I had a letter from Burroughs--did I tell you?-- [...] About my Cyprepedium regin√¶; [...] He says it's not reported so far north. [...] There! there's the bell. He's rung. But you go down [...] And bring him up, and don't let Mrs. Corbin.-- [...] Oh, well, we'll soon be through with it. I'm tired." [...] Willis brought up besides the Boston lawyer [...] A little barefoot girl who in the noise [...] Of heavy footsteps in the old frame house, [...] And baritone importance of the lawyer, [...] Stood for a while unnoticed with her hands [...] Shyly behind her. [...] "Well, and how is Mister----" [...] The lawyer was already in his satchel [...] As if for papers that might bear the name [...] He hadn't at command. [...] "You must excuse me, [...] I dropped in at the mill and was detained." [...] "Looking round, I suppose," [...] said Willis. [...] "Yes, [...] Well, yes." [...] "Hear anything that might prove useful?" [...] The Broken One saw Anne. [...] "Why, here is Anne. [...] What do you want, dear? Come, stand by the bed; [...] Tell me what is it?" [...] Anne just wagged her dress [...] With both hands held behind her. [...] "Guess," [...] she said. [...] "Oh, guess which hand? My my! Once on a time [...] I knew a lovely way to tell for certain [...] By looking in the ears. But I forget it. [...] Er, let me see. I think I'll take the right. [...] That's sure to be right even if it's wrong. [...] Come, hold it out. Don't change.--A Ram's Horn orchid! [...] A Ram's Horn! What would I have got, I wonder, [...] If I had chosen left. Hold out the left. [...] Another Ram's Horn! Where did you find those, [...] Under what beech tree, on what woodchuck's knoll?" [...] Anne looked at the large lawyer at her side, [...] And thought she wouldn't venture on so much. [...] "Were there no others?" [...] "There were four or five. [...] I knew you wouldn't let me pick them all." [...] "I wouldn't--so I wouldn't. You're the girl! [...] You see Anne has her lesson learned by heart." [...] "I wanted there should be some there next year." [...] "Of course you did. You left the rest for seed, [...] And for the backwoods woodchuck. You're the girl! [...] A Ram's Horn orchid seedpod for a woodchuck [...] Sounds something like. Better than farmer's beans [...] To a discriminating appetite, [...] Though the Ram's Horn is seldom to be had [...] In bushel lots--doesn't come on the market. [...] But, Anne, I'm troubled; have you told me all? [...] You're hiding something. That's as bad as lying. [...] You ask this lawyer man. And it's not safe [...] With a lawyer at hand to find you out. [...] Nothing is hidden from some people, Anne. [...] You don't tell me that where you found a Ram's Horn [...] You didn't find a Yellow Lady's Slipper. [...] What did I tell you? What? I'd blush, I would. [...] Don't you defend yourself. If it was there, [...] Where is it now, the Yellow Lady's Slipper?" [...] "Well, wait--it's common--it's too common." [...] "Common? [...] The Purple Lady's Slipper's commoner." [...] "I didn't bring a Purple Lady's Slipper [...] To You--to you I mean--they're both too common." [...] The lawyer gave a laugh among his papers [...] As if with some idea that she had scored. [...] "I've broken Anne of gathering bouquets. [...] It's not fair to the child. It can't be helped though: [...] Pressed into service means pressed out of shape. [...] Somehow I'll make it right with her--she'll see. [...] She's going to do my scouting in the field, [...] Over stone walls and all along a wood [...] And by a river bank for water flowers, [...] The floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart, [...] And at the sinus under water a fist [...] Of little fingers all kept down but one, [...] And that thrust up to blossom in the sun [...] As if to say, 'You! You're the Heart's desire.' [...] Anne has a way with flowers to take the place [...] Of that she's lost: she goes down on one knee [...] And lifts their faces by the chin to hers [...] And says their names, and leaves them where they are." [...] The lawyer wore a watch the case of which [...] Was cunningly devised to make a noise [...] Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut [...] At such a time as this. He snapped it now. [...] "Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait. [...] The lawyer man is thinking of his train. [...] He wants to give me lots and lots of money [...] Before he goes, because I hurt myself, [...] And it may take him I don't know how long. [...] But put our flowers in water first. Will, help her: [...] The pitcher's too full for her. There's no cup? [...] Just hook them {{on the inside of the}} pitcher. [...] Now run.--Get out your documents! You see [...] I have to keep on the good side of Anne. [...] I'm a great boy to think of number one. [...] And you can't blame me in the place I'm in. [...] Who will take care of my necessities [...] Unless I do?" [...] "A pretty interlude," [...] The lawyer said. [...] "I'm sorry, but my train-- [...] Luckily terms are all agreed upon. [...] You only have to sign your name. Right--there." [...] "You, Will, stop making faces. Come round here [...] Where you can't make them. What is it you want? [...] I'll put you out with Anne. Be good or go." [...] "You don't mean you will sign that thing unread?" [...] "Make yourself useful then, and read it for me. [...] Isn't it something I have seen before?" [...] "You'll find it is. Let your friend look at it." [...] "Yes, but all that takes time, and I'm as much [...] In haste to get it over with as you. [...] But read it, read it. That's right, draw the curtain: [...] Half the time I don't know what's troubling me.-- [...] What do you say, Will? Don't you be a fool, [...] You! crumpling folkses legal documents. [...] Out with it if you've any real objection." [...] "Five hundred dollars!" [...] "What would you think right?" [...] "A thousand wouldn't be a cent too much; [...] You know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is [...] Accepting anything before he knows [...] Whether he's ever going to walk again. [...] It smells to me like a dishonest trick." [...] "I think--I think--from what I heard to-day-- [...] And saw myself--he would be ill-advised----" [...] "What did you hear, for instance?" [...] Willis said. [...] "Now the place where the accident occurred----" [...] The Broken One was twisted in his bed. [...] "This is between you two apparently. [...] Where I come in is what I want to know. [...] You stand up to it like a pair of cocks. [...] Go outdoors if you want to fight. Spare me. [...] When you come back, I'll have the papers signed. [...] Will pencil do? Then, please, your fountain pen. [...] One of you hold my head up from the pillow." [...] Willis flung off the bed. [...] "I wash my hands-- [...] I'm no match--no, and don't pretend to be----" [...] The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen. [...] "You're doing the wise thing: you won't regret it. [...] We're very sorry for you." [...] Willis sneered: [...] "Who's we?--some stockholders in Boston? [...] I'll go outdoors, by gad, and won't come back." [...] "Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come. [...] Yes. Thanks for caring. Don't mind Will: he's savage. [...] He thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers. [...] You don't know what I mean about the flowers. [...] Don't stop to try to now. You'll miss your train. [...] Good-bye." [...] He flung his arms around his face.|$|R
