40|$|Abstract. Based on Fick’s second law and {{the damage}} {{evolution}} due to sulfate attack, a new model is proposed to analyze the diffusion of <b>sulfate</b> <b>ions</b> in concrete. The relation between erosion damage and erosion time, {{as well as the}} concentration of <b>sulfate</b> <b>ions</b> is firstly investigated by virtue of the ultrasonic experimental results. Furthermore, the damage evolution is treated as the increase of porosity, and a new nonlinear differential equation on the diffusion of <b>sulfate</b> <b>ions</b> is established by substituting such an increasing porosity into Fick’s law. The nonlinear diffusion equation is then solved by numerical method. It is found that the erosion damage can significantly affect the diffusion of <b>sulfate</b> <b>ions</b> in concrete...|$|R

25|$|Sulfates (SO4) in {{the soil}} or in groundwater, in {{sufficient}} concentration, can react with the Portland cement in concrete causing the formation of expansive products, e.g., ettringite or thaumasite, {{which can lead to}} early failure of the structure. The most typical attack of this type is on concrete slabs and foundation walls at grades where the <b>sulfate</b> <b>ion,</b> via alternate wetting and drying, can increase in concentration. As the concentration increases, the attack on the Portland cement can begin. For buried structures such as pipe, this type of attack is much rarer, especially in the eastern United States. The <b>sulfate</b> <b>ion</b> concentration increases much slower {{in the soil}} mass and is especially dependent upon the initial amount of sulfates in the native soil. A chemical analysis of soil borings to check for the presence of sulfates should be undertaken during the design phase of any project involving concrete in contact with the native soil. If the concentrations are found to be aggressive, various protective coatings can be applied. Also, in the US ASTM C150 Type 5 Portland cement can be used in the mix. This type of cement is designed to be particularly resistant to a sulfate attack.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt is {{well-established}} that {{a competitive}} adsorption exists between polycarboxylate superplasticizers (SP) and <b>sulfate</b> <b>ions</b> solubilized in the interstitial solution of cement paste, which may cause {{a loss of}} the dispersing properties.

500|$|Many of {{the flavor}} {{characteristics}} of Grodziskie {{result from the}} chemical makeup of the water that the breweries used to produce the beer. [...] The water {{from one of the}} wells on Poznańska Street in Grodzisk was tested, and showed a <b>sulfate</b> <b>ion</b> concentration of 183 parts per million (ppm) and a chloride ion concentration of 81 ppm. [...] Alkalinity (as calcium bicarbonate) was 350 ppm and the magnesium ion concentration was 34 ppm. [...] Using this type of water to produce beer would result in a higher than expected hop flavor because of the high alkalinity and the ratio of sulfate ions to chloride ions. [...] During the early stages of production, this water would have a higher pH, which would inhibit the efficiency of the natural enzymes that convert the starch in the grain to fermentable sugars during mashing. [...] The result is a beer with more unfermented sugars and lower average alcohol content. [...] Finally, the water would have contributed a slightly sour or bitter flavor to the beer, due to the high concentration of magnesium ions.|$|E
500|$|Compounds {{containing}} {{one or more}} elements {{which can}} exist {{in a variety of}} charge/oxidation states will have a stoichiometry that depends on which oxidation states are present, to ensure overall neutrality. This can be indicated in the name by specifying either the oxidation state of the elements present, or the charge on the ions. Because of the risk of ambiguity in allocating oxidation states, IUPAC prefers direct indication of the ionic charge numbers. These are written as an arabic integer followed by the sign (..., 2−, 1−, 1+, 2+,...) in parentheses directly after the name of the cation (without a space separating them). For example, FeSO4 is named iron(2+) sulfate (with the 2+ charge on the Fe2+ ions balancing the 2− charge on the <b>sulfate</b> <b>ion),</b> whereas Fe2(SO4)3 is named iron(3+) sulfate (because the two iron ions in each formula unit each have a charge of 3+, to balance the 2− on each of the three sulfate ions). Stock nomenclature, still in common use, writes the oxidation number in Roman numerals (..., −II, −I, 0, I, II,...). So the examples given above would be named iron(II) sulfate and iron(III) sulfate respectively. For simple ions the ionic charge and the oxidation number are identical, but for polyatomic ions they often differ. For example, the uranyl(2+) ion, , has uranium in an oxidation state of +6, so would be called a dioxouranium(VI) ion in Stock nomenclature. An even older naming system for metal cations, also still widely used, appended the suffixes -ous and -ic to the Latin root of the name, to give special names for the low and high oxidation states. For example, this scheme uses [...] "ferrous" [...] and [...] "ferric", for iron(II) and iron(III) respectively, so the examples given above were classically named ferrous sulfate and ferric sulfate.|$|E
50|$|Precipitate {{formation}} {{is useful in}} the detection {{of the type of}} cation in a salt. To do this, an alkali first reacts with the unknown salt to produce a precipitate that is the hydroxide of the unknown salt. To identify the cation, the color of the precipitate and its solubility in excess are noted. Similar processes are often used in sequence - for example, a barium nitrate solution will react with <b>sulfate</b> <b>ions</b> to form a solid barium sulfate precipitate, indicating that it is likely that <b>sulfate</b> <b>ions</b> are present.|$|R

30|$|Usually, {{when there}} is no structure-directing chemical, the {{morphology}} will be rectangular in shape. When structure-directing chemicals such as <b>sulfate</b> and chlorine <b>ions</b> were added, then one can see the formation of one-dimensional nanowire/nanorod-like structures. Though the exact reason is not reported, it is believed that <b>sulfate</b> <b>ions</b> {{play a major role in}} giving one-dimensional shape, i.e., <b>sulfate</b> <b>ions</b> adsorb to the surface of the seed crystals of WO 3 and thereby decrease the surface energy of the WO 3 seed crystals in all directions except one direction. In this particular undisturbed direction, further growth takes place by means of agglomeration/attachment with other seed layers. This process continues to give one-dimensional wire/rod-like structures.|$|R

Iron was selected as a material to study the effects of these ions on it. It will be useful as a reference material in a more exhaustive study carried out in the laboratory. In order to understand the electrochemical behavior of iron in these media, several electroanalytical methods were used like the cyclic voltamperometry, the chronoamperometry, the chronopotentiometry, the rotating disk electrode disc, etc. The electrochemical techniques were supplemented by measurements of scanning electron microscopy, the Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, x-ray fluorescence, and inductively coupled plasma.
