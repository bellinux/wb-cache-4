5|$|Up to {{four people}} {{can play in}} {{multiplayer}} mode, which has specific rules predetermined by the players. Stock and timed matches {{are two of the}} multiplayer modes of play. This gives each player a certain number of lives or a <b>selected</b> <b>time</b> limit, before beginning the match. Free for all or team battles are also a choice during matches using stock or time. A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one or a team has lost all of their lives. A multiplayer game may also end in a tie if two or more players have the same score when time expires, which causes the round to end in sudden death.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain was {{satisfied}} with the Munich conference, calling the outcome [...] "peace for our time", while Hitler was angered about the missed opportunity for war in 1938; he expressed his disappointment in a speech on 9 October in Saarbrücken. In Hitler's view, the British-brokered peace, although favourable to the ostensible German demands, was a diplomatic defeat which spurred his intent of limiting British power {{to pave the way}} for the eastern expansion of Germany. As a result of the summit, Hitler was <b>selected</b> <b>Time</b> magazine's Man of the Year for 1938.|$|E
500|$|Heyer {{intended}} the novel {{to be the}} first instalment in a trilogy covering the House of Lancaster at the peak of its power (1393–1435), with John as its central character. She felt that John, now largely unknown today, was ideal because he was a [...] "great man" [...] who lived during the entirety of her <b>selected</b> <b>time</b> period and was the most trusted brother of Henry V. However, Heyer failed to complete the trilogy, finding herself distracted with the writing of her popular Regency novels to please her fans and offset her tax liabilities. She died in 1974, and My Lord John was published by her family a year later. It covered only the early life of John of Lancaster, from 1393 to 1413.|$|E

500|$|According to Heyer's husband George Ronald Rougier, the Lancaster trilogy was {{to centre}} on John of Lancaster {{because he was}} Henry V's most trusted brother, lived during the {{entirety}} of her <b>selected</b> <b>time</b> period, and [...] "was a great man" [...] little known today. In her novel, Heyer describes John as possessing the [...] "best temper of all his family, and the greatest talent for peacemaking." [...] Rougier stated that the perfectionist Heyer prepared for the trilogy by embarking on holistic research that covered [...] "every aspect of the period," [...] including its wars, social conditions, and heraldry. Heyer learned to read medieval English and created indexed files that catalogued every single day for the forty year time period. She and her husband travelled England and Scotland, where Heyer took copious notes while visiting seventy-five castles and twenty-three abbeys.|$|E
2500|$|The LI30 {{value is}} the {{percentage}} of remaining clot stability {{in relation to the}} MCF value at 30 min after CT. A similar value can also be calculated at other time points (45 or 60 min). The ML parameter describes {{the percentage of}} lost clot stability (relative to MCF, in %) viewed at any <b>selected</b> <b>time</b> point or when the test has been stopped. [...] A low LI (X) value or a high ML value indicates hyperfibrinolysis. While in normal blood fibrinolysis activity is quite low, in clinical samples a more rapid loss of clot stability by hyperfibrinolysis may lead to bleeding complications which can be treated by the administration of antifibrinolytic drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Open mode systems, are {{designed}} to find soil flux rates when measuring chamber equilibrium has been reached. Air flows through the chamber before the chamber is closed and sealed. This purges any non-ambient CO2 levels from the chamber before measurement. After the chamber is closed, fresh air is pumped into the chamber at a controlled and programmable flow rate. This mixes with the CO2 from the soil, and after a time, equilibrium is reached. The researcher specifies the equilibrium point as the difference in CO2 measurements between successive readings, in an elapsed time. During the assay, {{the rate of change}} slowly reduces until it meets the customer's rate of change criteria, or the maximum <b>selected</b> <b>time</b> for the assay. [...] Soil flux or rate of change is then determined once equilibrium conditions are reached within the chamber. Chamber flow rates and times are programmable, accurately measured, and used in calculations. These systems have vents that {{are designed}} to prevent a possible unacceptable buildup of partial CO2 pressure discussed under closed mode systems. Since the air movement inside the chamber might cause increased chamber pressure, or external winds may produce reduced chamber pressure, a vent is provided that is designed to be as wind proof as possible.|$|E
