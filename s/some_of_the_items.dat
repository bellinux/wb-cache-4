5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> {{from the}} expedition, {{including}} the balloon-silk boat and the tent, {{are on display}} at the Andréeexpeditionen Polar Centre at Grenna Museum, Sweden.

5|$|The protagonist, Samus Aran, {{must travel}} through the world of Tallon IV searching for twelve Chozo Artifacts that will open {{the path to the}} Phazon meteor impact crater, while {{collecting}} power-ups that enable the player to reach previously inaccessible areas. The Varia Suit, for example, protects Samus' armor against dangerously high temperatures, allowing her to enter volcanic regions. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> are obtained after boss and mini-boss fights, which are encountered in all regions except Magmoor Caverns. Items must be collected in a specific order so that the player may progress. For example, players cannot access certain areas until they find a certain Beam to open doors, or discover new ordnance with which to beat bosses. Like the rest of the series, players are incentivized to explore the open world to find upgrades such as ammunition packs and extra health.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, a {{descendant}} of George Ellicott decided to sell at auction <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items,</b> including a table, candlesticks and molds. Although supporters of the planned Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Oella, Maryland, had hoped to obtain these and several other items related to Banneker and the Ellicotts, a Virginia investment banker won most of the items {{with a series of}} bids that totaled $49,750. The purchaser stated that he expected to keep <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> and to donate the rest to the planned African American Civil War Memorial museum in Washington, D.C.|$|E

5000|$|Transliminality is {{positively}} correlated with openness to experience and negatively correlated with tough-mindedness and self-control from <b>the</b> 16PF Questionnaire. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>item</b> content assesses absorption and the scale is therefore correlated with the Tellegen Absorption Scale. Transliminality is conceptually similar to Ernest Hartmann's concept of [...] "boundaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mind" [...] and accordingly is correlated with the Boundary Questionnaire.|$|R
25|$|Toronto Police Service held press {{conferences}} {{to speak out}} against inappropriate actions of protesters, including displaying items alleged to have been seized from protesters. However, when confronted, Chief Blair admitted that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> were unrelated to the G20 protests.|$|E
25|$|This {{scale is}} made up of 90 items {{analysing}} 9 aspects relating couple's intimacy: sexuality, love, expressiveness, marital cohesion, couple compatibility, partners' independence, conflicts, social identity and desirability bias. This scale seems to be reliable and free from sexual preconceptions although plethoric in conceptualising <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dog coats, collars, cute sweaters, shirts, stylish dresses, and booties are <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> people {{purchase}} to adorn {{their dogs}} with style.

25|$|Lack of self-correction: {{scientific}} research programmes make mistakes, but {{they tend to}} reduce these errors over time. By contrast, ideas may be regarded as pseudoscientific because they have remained unaltered despite contradictory evidence. The work Scientists Confront Velikovsky (1976) Cornell University, also delves into these features in some detail, as does the work of Thomas Kuhn, e.g. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962) which also discusses <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> on the list of characteristics of pseudoscience.|$|E
25|$|Private treaty sales – Occasionally, {{when looking}} at an auction {{catalogue}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> have been withdrawn. Usually these goods have been sold by 'private treaty'. This means that the goods have already been sold off, usually to a trader or dealer on a private, behind-the-scenes basis before {{they have had a}} chance to be offered at the auction sale. These goods are rarely in single lots – photocopiers or fax machines would generally be sold in bulk lots.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} items had been {{deliberately}} broken and {{are thought to have}} been placed in the lake as votive offerings. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> appear to have been of local manufacture, a few were manufactured in Ireland, but many originate from southern England, suggesting that the fame of Llyn Cerrig Bach as a holy site may have spread well beyond the immediate area. However {{it is also possible that}} they were traded or plunder captured in warfare by the local tribes. No direct Roman influence can be seen on any of the objects found.|$|E

25|$|Items include Tibetan-script books, {{documents}} and scrolls, {{the arts of}} Tibetan theatre, Tibetan musical instruments, Tibetan medicine, Tibetan astronomy and calendar reckoning (including charts), Tibetan sculpture, and thangka painting and arts. The exhibited artefacts are protected by the Tibetan Autonomous Region Cultural Relics Protection Organization given the uniqueness and cultural value of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items.</b> There are numerous statues of buddhas, bodhisattvas, and figures, masks, rare sutras written on pattra leaves and birch bars, and manuscripts written with gold, silver and coral powder. There are many items of Tibetan handicrafts, and invaluable jewellery such as gold, silver and jade items.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, much of Margaret's {{estate was}} {{auctioned}} by Christie's to meet inheritance tax, though <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> {{were sold in}} aid of charities such as the Stroke Association. A world record price of £1.24million was set by a Fabergé clock. The Poltimore tiara, which she wore for her wedding in 1960, sold for £926,400. The sale of her effects totalled £13,658,000. In April 2007, an exhibition titled Princess Line – The Fashion Legacy of Princess Margaret opened at Kensington Palace, showcasing contemporary fashion from British designers such as Vivienne Westwood inspired by Princess Margaret's legacy of style. Christopher Bailey's Spring 2006 collection for Burberry was inspired by Margaret's look from the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|After being enlarged, Coldstream Mill {{was used}} for {{preparing}} animal feed or meal, grinding linseed cake, beans, maize and barley. The mill had three sets of stones, two working whilst one was being dressed (serviced and sharpened). The mill never had an electricity supply and never needed any auxiliary power thanks to the mill pond. The mill was the last traditional working water mill in Ayrshire {{and one of the}} last in Scotland. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> for the mill are on display at the nearby Dalgarven Mill museum near Kilwinning. The mill was converted to a private house and the waterwheel and mill pond have been preserved as part of this development.|$|E

25|$|Mexican {{handcrafts}} {{and folk}} {{art is a}} complex collection of items made with various materials and intended for utilitarian, decorative or other purposes. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> produced by hand in this country include ceramics, wall hangings, vases, furniture, textiles and much more. In Mexico, both crafts created for utilitarian purposes and folk art are collectively known as “artesanía” as both have a similar history and both are a valued part of Mexico’s national identity. Mexico’s artesanía tradition {{is a blend of}} indigenous and European techniques and designs. This blending, called “mestizo” was particularly emphasized by Mexico’s political, intellectual and artistic elite in the early 20th century after the Mexican Revolution toppled Porfirio Díaz’s French-style and modernization-focused presidency. Today, Mexican artesanía is exported {{and is one of the}} reasons why tourists are attracted to the country. However, competition from manufactured products and imitations from countries like China have caused problems for Mexico’s artisans.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} get to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> and {{progress}} through the game, Bart must use equipment such as rockets and cherry-bombs, which are bought with coins that can be collected by getting rid of aliens. Bart is controlled by the player both on foot and on a skateboard. To get rid of aliens, which are disguised as real humans, he needs to jump on their heads, although some are just regular humans. The game increases in difficulty for every level, and Bart meets up with a boss {{at the end of the}} first four. The levels are familiar to fans of The Simpsons and some of the television humor appears in the game: for example, in the first level Bart can make a prank call to the bartender Moe in order for him to run outside so that the player can spray paint his purple apron (an example of an item that the aliens need) into a red color that the aliens do not want. The game also includes some minigames.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturers {{point out}} {{that many of the}} {{products}} to be impacted are already making their way through the supply chain. As a result, much inventory that was legal prior to the signing of the law and was manufactured shortly thereafter will probably be on shelves as the deadlines approach. The Natural Resources Defense Council and Public Citizen apparently agree that these products are already in distribution, but believe that manufacturers should still be held liable. The problem is not the lead or phthalate content, as they imply, {{but the fact that the}} products must be tested to make sure they comply. There is also confusion of what products need a GCC and which do not. They have not been tested because the items generally do not contain hazardous materials; CPSC has been slow to define some of the accreditation or testing criteria; some of the low volume, low value items are not economical to test; and lot tracking methods would not allow <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> to be tracked.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>the</b> Luxury Lounge, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{displayed}} <b>items</b> were: an iRiver MP3 player, Oris watches, and {{the video}} game True Crime: New York City on a television.|$|R

500|$|Hines' {{enthusiasm for}} {{collecting}} German military equipment and German soldiers' personal possessions became well known within and possibly {{outside of his}} battalion, and earned him the nickname of [...] "Souvenir King". Although he collected some items from battlefields at Ypres and the Somme region, most were stolen from German prisoners of war. He kept the items he collected for himself, {{and there are no}} records of any being handed over to the Australian War Records Section, the AIF unit responsible for collecting items for later display in Australia. Hines sold <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> he collected to other soldiers, including for alcohol. The photograph of Hines at the Battle of Polygon Wood was published in late 1917 under the title Wild Eye, the souvenir king and became one of the best-known Australian photographs of the war. Many soldiers identified with Hines and were amused by his collection of souvenirs. The photograph was used as propaganda, and a false story developed that the German Kaiser Wilhelm II had become enraged after seeing it.|$|E
500|$|Carter, Duchovny and Anderson {{celebrated the}} 20th {{anniversary of the}} series at a July 18, 2013 panel at the San Diego Comic-Con hosted by TV Guide. During the discussion, Anderson {{discussed}} Scully's influence on female fans, relating {{that a number of}} women have informed her that they entered into careers in physics because of the character. Anderson also indicated that she was not in favor of an X-Files miniseries, and Duchovny ruled out working with her on an unrelated project, but both expressed willingness to do a third feature film. Carter was more reserved at the idea, stating, [...] "You need a reason to get excited about going on and doing it again." [...] The series attained a degree of historical importance, as well. On July 16, 2008, Carter and Spotnitz donated several props from the series and new film to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> included the original pilot script and the [...] "I Want to Believe" [...] poster from Mulder's office.|$|E
500|$|Development of Baldur's Gate II {{began in}} January 1999. From the {{suggestions}} of fans on message boards and newsgroups, reviews of Baldur's Gate, and internal suggestions, {{a list of}} constructive criticism was compiled; from this list, a slightly shorter one of features {{to be added to}} the game was made. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> on this list were: support for higher resolutions, such as 800 by 600 pixels and above; 3D support; non-pausing dialogue in multiplayer; drop off panels in the interface; character kits; dual-wielding of weapons; a streamlined journal and annotable map; deathmatch; and inclusion of famous AD monsters such as the dragon. Not many features had to be cut, and they kept as many as they could. Because of the engine's mature state of development, most features were fairly easy to add. Ben Smedstad, the producer of the game, said, [...] "The engine was up and running since day one, which is a huge morale booster. When a monster is complete, we put it into the 'override' directory and it appears in the game! This is a huge change from working on the original." [...] Late in the project, deathmatch was removed, while non-pausing dialogue, which proved [...] "the most problematic feature", was removed early on before being reintroduced in early 2000.|$|E
