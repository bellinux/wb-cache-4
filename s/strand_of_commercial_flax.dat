From 1858 on, almost all commercial development in Uppertown converged along West 7th Street. This made inevitable the re-purposing of the Waldman House as residence—which likely occurred in 1863, shortly after Waldmans purchase. Fetzers Saloon next door also closed and became the Fetzer familys residence. One can imagine Fuchs reaction, long after selling his property, when {{the construction of the}} High Bridge in 1889 once again turned (now) Smith Avenue into a major thoroughfare.|$|R
40|$|Detection and {{quantification}} of {{the prevalence}} of genetically modified (GM) organism contamination in seed exports is a critical element of regulatory compliance. While the procedures to reliably detect high levels of GM contamination are well understood, no comparable statistical approaches are available for the quantification of levels of GM prevalence below the established detection rate of standard tests. Presented is a simple statistical approach based on simulation modeling for the quantification of low levels of GM contamination. The approach can be modified to match any sampling regime and can account for rates of false positive and negative assay results. The application of this method is demonstrated using {{the low level of}} contamination in Canadian <b>commercial</b> <b>flax</b> stocks by the GM flax variety “Triffid. ” We show that rates of GM contamination in <b>commercial</b> <b>flax</b> stocks ranged between 1 GM seed per million and 1 seed per hundred thousand. A simulation model was used to determine whether the observed rates of positive tests are within the range expected from false positive rates of the test. We showed that for the majority of categories of grain or seed, the very low level of GM prevalence still remains outside that which is to be expected based on false positives returned or by chance alone. These results indicate a pervasive low-level presence of GM construct in the Canadian <b>commercial</b> <b>flax</b> system...|$|R

40|$|The {{technique}} of image analysis {{has been used}} to assess the quality <b>of</b> model oriented <b>strand</b> board panels by investigating the relationships between shape and size <b>of</b> <b>strands,</b> the distribution <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> and bending properties. A batch <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>strands</b> was analysed by image analysis and the distribution of the shape and size <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> was quantified. The strands were categorised into five strand types as a function of size and aspect ratio. In general, strand shapes were observed to be mostly rectangular and there was also a wide variation in strand dimensions in commercial material. Bigger area strands had low aspect ratios and small strands had high aspect ratios. Half <b>of</b> the <b>commercial</b> <b>strands</b> were longer than 100 mm. Model OSB panels were manufactured in the laboratory by hot pressing strand mats formed from each <b>of</b> the five <b>strand</b> types. Strands were laid up by hand into the forming mat and following pressing the orientation and shape <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> was evaluated by image analysis and the panels were tested in a three point bending. Large area (type 3) strands with high aspect ratios produced model panels with optimum strand orientation and mechanical properties. Type 3 panels were also fabricated from strands dropped through a slotted forming device in order to simulate the delivery <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> to the forming line under factory conditions. As the height <b>of</b> <b>strand</b> delivery increased from 0 to 100 to 200 mm the disorientation <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> in the pressed panels progressively increased and as a result mechanical properties in bending were reduced. Image analysis is therefore a powerful tool for evaluating the distribution <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>strand</b> shapes and the relationship between strand geometry, strand orientation and the mechanical properties <b>of</b> oriented <b>strand</b> board...|$|R

40|$|Magnesium diboride MgB 2 {{in simple}} round wire form has shown {{significant}} {{potential to be}} a low-cost resistive superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL). The <b>commercial</b> exploitation <b>of</b> MgB 2 SFCLs for typical distribution network voltages requires a considerable scale-up of the current-carrying capability of MgB 2 wire. The two obvious options to achieve this are to increase the wire size and use multifilament wire and/or use multiple wire strands. This paper assesses the current capacity for multi-strand wire and presents results of initial tests on a three-strand MgB 2 demonstrator SFCL coil. Three <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> monofilament MgB 2 wire were braided together to form a single multi-strand wire.

In 1800 the <b>commercial</b> core <b>of</b> Sunderland was a small and functionally mixed area tied very closely to the river and the port trade. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the commercial core expanded and shifted in response to economic change and the spread of residential areas. The modern C.

The spatial behaviour <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> establishments is investigated with respect to birth, life, death, directional and distance parameters. The responses of individual managers and firms to changing circumstances in central Sunderland are surveyed. General spatial patterns are discernible at varying scales which confirm expected tendencies. Finally, some generalisations on the process <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> change in a central area are suggested by reference to a flow diagram and set of indices, which hold for all places and at all times...|$|R

40|$|Many {{applications}} in textile require color measurement <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> yarns due to unavailability {{of a mass}} of consecutive yarns. While multispectral imaging systems can capture images <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> yarns, an unavoidable problem accompanied is how to specify their colors from images, in which pixel values vary with positions owing to three-dimensional shape of yarn. Based on the response of multispectral imaging systems to single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> yarns, this article formulates the color specification problem as an optimization question and four methods are proposed: average of all pixels (AA), average of pixels in central area (AC), maxima of all pixels (MA), and lightness weighting method (LW). The first experiment analyzed color distribution of pixels on a single <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> yarn. Experimental results show pixels in central area have smallest color variation and largest intensity. The second experiment compared the proposed methods. Results show that CIEXYZ, L*, and C* values specified by the AA and MA methods are lowest and highest. Finally, colors <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> yarns specified by the proposed methods were compared with spectrophotometric colors of yarn windings using 12 pairs <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> yarns and yarn windings.
