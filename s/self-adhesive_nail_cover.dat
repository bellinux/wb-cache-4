Reznor would hear the Fear And Bullets album and offer Trust Obey a five-album contract with Nothing Records, making them {{one of the earliest}} acts signed to the label. In an interview on the bootleg Nine Inch Nails disc, Disturbed, Reznor discussed singing Trust Obey, noting that the band was [...] "not a great commercial potential." ...|$|R
40|$|Ingrown toenail is {{a disease}} of both {{children}} and adults, causing discomfort or pain of varying degrees of severity. Depending {{on the stage of}} disease, it is often the cause of significant difficulties in daily life. Etiopathogenesis of ingrown <b>nail</b> <b>covers</b> external pressure, internal pressure and presence of additional factors. The course of the disease is usually chronic, and it affects mainly the big toe. Decompression shaft side, opening track nail growth and proper hygiene play the key role in prevention and treatment of the disease. Despite the existence of different treatments for ingrown nail, many of them have low efficacy, which is the reason for the high relapse rate...|$|R
50|$|Her {{doctor says}} that she died of chronic liver problems. The woman's companion, Miss Minnie Lawson, is the {{unexpected}} beneficiary of a substantial fortune and the house, according to the will written while Emily recovered from the earlier fall. Under the previous will, Miss Arundell's nephew Charles Arundell and nieces Theresa Arundell and Bella Tanios, would have inherited. This gives them all motive for the first possible attempted murder. While examining the house, under the pretense of buying it, Poirot discovers a <b>nail</b> <b>covered</b> with varnish and a small string tied to it {{at the top of}} the stairs. Before her death Miss Arundell had said something about 'Bob...dog...picture...ajar'. Poirot concludes that this means a jar with a picture of a dog on it and that Bob could not have put the ball on the staircase, because he had been out all night. Miss Arundell therefore fell over a tripwire tied to the nail.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{main goal}} was {{to work out the}} {{technology}} of deposition of carbon layers onto surface of medical implants made of the AISI 316 L medical steel. So far the results of carried investigations have proved that layers synthesized in RF PACVD process noticeably improve the biotolerance of the medical steel. Positive experimental results concerning the implementation of carbon layers conducted in the Institute of Materials Science and Engineering of the Technical University of Lodz were the basis for attempt of industrial application of the worked out technology. Design/methodology/approach: Carbon layers were manufactured using radio frequency plasma RF PACVD method. The technology was worked out for the surfaces of the intramedullary nails. The investigations were carried out in order to compare obtained synthesis results with the layers deposited under the laboratory conditions. In this work the following are presented: the surface topography investigation, results of nanohardness and adhesion measurements as well as the raman spectra. Medical examination results were presented in our earlier publications. In the description of obtained investigation results are also presented the preliminary results of the medical treatment effects with the use of intramedullary <b>nails</b> <b>covered</b> with the carbon layer. Findings: Carbon layers manufactured onto intramedullary nails presented good mechanical properties. Applied synthesis parameters made it possible to manufacture uniform film onto whole implant surface. Thickness of the layer was varied in the range of 200 – 400 nm, however total modification area contained 3. 5 micrometers. <b>Nails</b> <b>covered</b> with the carbon layer positively passed the tests and were admitted into medical trade turnover. Positive medical treatment results were observed especially in case of patients with affirmed allergies onto alloying components contained in medical steels like chromium and nickel. Research limitations/implications: Significant matter for the examinations had the introduction of the additional control parameters of the plasmo-chemical layers synthesis process. From {{the point of view of}} the industrial implementation of technology the fact of limited process efficiency can be. Originality/value: The fundamental value of conducted investigations is the industrial application of the technology of deposition of carbon layers onto intramedullary nails. Currently those products are available in the business offer of MEDGAL Company...|$|R

40|$|Cosmetics applied on {{the nail}} {{encompass}} three types: (1) coatings that harden upon evaporation; (2) coatings that polymerize; and (3) stick-on <b>nail</b> dressings (synthetic <b>covers).</b> The adverse reactions {{induced by the}} two first types present with both local reactions and distant contact dermatitis. Whereas nail enamel applications result especially in ectopic contact dermatitis, polymerizing coatings and synthetic covers represent the main culprit for sometimes severe, local reactions. Whatever {{the nature of the}} nail cosmetics, they may produce some adverse reactions. They include: (1) local reactions to cosmetics applied on the nail; (2) distant reactions resulting from the use of nail cosmetics; (3) systemic side effects of nail cosmetics; and (4) infection risks from nail cosmetics.

40|$|Tabique {{is one of}} {{the main}} Portuguese {{traditional}} building techniques which use raw materials as stone, earth andwood. In general, a tabique building component as a wall consist of a wooden structure made up of vertical boards connected to laths by metal <b>nails</b> and <b>covered</b> on both sides by an earth based material. This traditional building technology as an expressive incidence in the Alto Douro Wine Region located in the interior of Northern Portugal, added to the UNESCO’s Word Heritage Sites List in December 2001 as an ‘evolved continuing cultural landscape’. Furthermore, previous research works have shown that the existing tabique construction, in this region, reveals a certain lack of maintenance partially justified by the knowledge loosed on that technique, consequently this construction technique present an advanced stage of deterioration. This aspect associated to the fact that there is still a lack of scientific studies in this field motivated the writing of this paper, the main objectives are to identify and characterize the nails used in the timber connections. The nails samples were collected from tabique walls included in tabique buildings located in LamegoMunicipality, near Douro River, in the Alto Douro Wine Region. This work also intends to give guidelines to the rehabilitation and preservation of this important legacy...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} wooden bridges in the United States. Their decks are often built of timber beams <b>nailed</b> {{together}} and <b>covered</b> with asphalt. The asphalt plays a mechanical role, {{and it provides}} environmental protection for the wood deck. The asphalt layer deteriorates and requires replacement. That leads to a faster deterioration of the deck, increased maintenance, and shorter bridge life. The flexibility of the deck is a probable cause of the fast deterioration of the asphalt. Low temperatures lead to deformations of the deck and may lead to cracks, which are propagated by mechanical and environmental effects. This project investigates stiffening the bridge deck by connecting a beam perpendicularly to the deck planks with metal bolts to reduce deformations of the deck. The additional beam is called a Transverse Stiffener Beam (or TSB). It can be incorporated {{as a part of}} new bridges or be attached to existing bridges. The investigations show the TSB significantly reduces deformations of the deck in most cases. The study indicates the positive effects of the TSB's should be expected in other applications. The magnitude of the effects can be analyzed with the computer program developed during this project. An investigation of the use of Transverse Stiffener Beams (TSB) for use on new and existing wooden bridges to reduce deformations of bridge decks, thus prolonging the life of asphalt bridge coverings, was undertaken. Positive effects of TSBs should be expected in other applications and can be analyzed with a computer program developed by this project. Local Road Research Boar...|$|R
