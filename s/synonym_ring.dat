The <b>synonym</b> <b>ring</b> function allows a searcher to use a single textword such as 'baby walker' to substitute for doing a series of regular textword searches using the 15 other terms by which the device is known. The entry of a single term in the textword+synonym box will produce a listing of all articles with text containing any of the synonyms for that term.|$|E

50|$|ISO 25964-2 {{deals with}} the {{challenges}} of using one thesaurus in combination with another, and/or with some other type of controlled vocabulary or knowledge organization system (KOS). The types covered include classification schemes, taxonomies, subject heading schemes, ontologies, name authority lists, terminologies and <b>synonym</b> <b>rings.</b> Within a single organization {{it is common to}} find several different such KOSs used in contexts such as the records management system, the library catalogue, the corporate intranet, the research lab, etc. To help users with the challenge of running a single search across all the available collections, ISO 25964-2 provides guidance on mapping between the terms and concepts of one thesaurus and those of the other KOSs. Where mapping is not a sensible option, the standard recommends other forms of complementary vocabulary use.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This Standard {{presents}} {{guidelines and}} conventions for the contents, display, construction, testing, maintenance, {{and management of}} monolingual controlled vocabularies. This Standard focuses on controlled vocabularies that are used for the representation of content objects in knowledge organization systems including lists, <b>synonym</b> <b>rings,</b> taxonomies, and thesauri. This Standard {{should be regarded as}} a set of recommendations based on preferred techniques and procedures. Optional procedures are, however, sometimes described, e. g., for the display of terms in a controlled vocabulary. The primary purpose of vocabulary control is to achieve consistency in the description of content objects and to facilitate retrieval. Vocabulary control is accomplished by three principal methods: defining the scope, or meaning, of terms; using the equivalence relationship to link synonymous and nearly synonymous terms; and distinguishing among homographs...|$|R

50|$|In {{metadata}} a <b>synonym</b> <b>ring</b> or synset, is a {{group of}} data elements that are considered semantically equivalent for the purposes of information retrieval. These data elements are frequently found in different metadata registries. Although a group of terms can be considered equivalent, metadata registries store the synonyms at a central location called the preferred data element.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examined}} {{the use of}} a pearl harvested <b>synonym</b> <b>ring</b> {{in the creation of a}} digital index on the subject of giftedness, with the goal of better defining the available information in the field and facilitating information retrieval. The pearl harvested <b>synonym</b> <b>ring</b> was used in the retrieval of citations relating to giftedness in the ERIC database. A content analysis of these citations provided the list of topics that would form the basis of a digital index. When the topics retrieved using the pearl harvested <b>synonym</b> <b>ring</b> were compared to the indices of two textbooks on gifted education, they were found to be more comprehensive and better representative of the field. The results of this study have potential implications in the improvement of digital indexing techniques, better understanding of academic fields of study, and creating a standard procedure for scoping reviews...|$|E

50|$|Since Part 1 of ISO 25964 was {{published}} {{it has been}} adopted by the national standards bodies {{in a number of}} countries. For example, The British Standards Institution (BSI) in the UK has adopted it and labelled it unchanged as BS ISO 25964-1. At the time of writing similar consideration is under way for Part 2.The American standard ANSI/NISO Z39.19 - Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies covers some of the same ground as ISO 25964-1. It deals with monolingual lists, <b>synonym</b> <b>rings</b> and taxonomies as well as thesauri, but does not provide a data model, nor address multilingual vocabularies or other aspects of interoperability, such as mapping between KOSs. Where the two standards overlap, they are broadly compatible with each other. NISO is actively involved in both standards, having participated in the work of developing ISO 25964 as well as running its Secretariat.The W3C Recommendation SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) has a close relationship with ISO 25964 {{in the context of the}} Semantic Web. SKOS applies to all sorts of “simple KOSs” that can be found on the Web, including thesauri and others. Whereas ISO 25964-1 advises on the selection and fitting together of concepts, terms and relationships to make a good thesaurus, SKOS addresses the next step - porting the thesaurus to the Web. And whereas ISO 25964-2 recommends the sort of mappings that can be established between one KOS and another, SKOS presents a way of expressing the mappings when published to the Web.|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} few years, the {{information}} representation and retrieval sector {{in the area of}} Documentation and Biblioteconomy has had to assume the important repercussions of the Internet and its associated technologies, and in particular, the World Wide Web (WWW). Technological modifications arising from these important changes are leading to the gradual digitalisation of the information representation and retrieval sector, affecting information artefacts, representation and retrieval tools and user requirements. In the light of this growing context of digitalisation, diverse information representation and retrieval tools exist, which must be studied in addition to diverse fields of knowledge in which these tools have originated: Linguistics, Artificial Intelligence, Documentation, Linguistic Engineering [...] . Hence, in specialised literature, analyses are performed on information representation and retrieval tools, taxonomies, classification systems, computational lexicons, lexical databases, thesauruses, titles lists, knowledge bases, conceptual maps, ontologies, <b>synonym</b> <b>rings</b> and semantic networks, among others. Among this wide spectrum of information representation and retrieval tools are thesauruses and ontologies, which are most often linked in bibliography, even though they come from completely different disciplinary areas. However, the conceptualisation applied by authors to the terms "thesaurus" and "ontology" is quite diverse, and sometimes authors confuse, oppose, complement or overlap both these concepts. The overall objective of the present article [1] is to establish the relationship between the concepts of thesaurus and ontology in the Documentation and Biblioteconomy field. Two specific objectives have been established for this purpose. Firstly, to make an analysis of the thesaurus-based concept with a view to defining its most important characteristics and to verify the similarities and differences it shares with ontologies. And secondly, to establish a definition for the ontology concept, also for the purpose of verifying its characteristics and analysing the similarities and differences it has with thesauruses...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the difficulties of}} on-line information searching {{as it relates to}} the topic of autism. A review of existing search strategies is presented and their limitations are discussed. A new method for deriving a set of search-terms for comprehensive searching, Pearl Harvesting, was tested here to determine the necessary search terms (i. e., <b>synonym</b> <b>ring)</b> for ERIC and PsycINFO databases. Once discovered and validated, a <b>synonym</b> <b>ring</b> can be copied and pasted directly into the search box of the database, providing a simple, thorough and time saving way of conducting on-line research in the field. This easily used method is applicable for use by professionals across disciplines. Specific characteristics of the ERIC and PsycINFO databases are discussed and conclusions are presented in relation to Pearl Harvesting...|$|E
40|$|Objective –To {{determine}} what skills employers in the United Kingdom (U. K.) want from information professionals as revealed through their job advertisements. Design – Content analysis, combining {{elements of both}} quantitative and qualitative content analysis. Orme describes it as “a descriptive non-experimental approach of content analysis” (62). Setting – Data {{for this study were}} obtained from job advertisements in the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professional’s (CILIP) Library and Information Gazette published from June 2006 through May 2007. Subjects – A total of 180 job advertisements. Methods – Job advertisements were selected using a random number generator, purposely selecting only 15 advertisements per first issue of each month of the Library and Information Gazette (published every two weeks). The author used several sources to create an initial list of skills required by information professionals, using such sources as prior studies that examined this topic, the Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA) database thesaurus, and personal knowledge. Synonyms for the skills were then added to the framework for coding. Skills that were coded had to be noted {{in such a way that}} the employer plainly stated the employee would be a certain skill or attribute or they were seeking a skill or a particular skill was essential or desirable. Skills that were stated in synonymous ways within the same advertisement were counted as two incidences of that skill. Duties for the position were not counted unless they were listed as a specific skill. Data were all coded by hand and then tallied. The author claims to have triangulated the results of this study with the literature review, the <b>synonym</b> <b>ring</b> used to prepare the coding framework, and a few notable studies. Main Results – A wide variety of job titles was observed, including “Copyright Clearance Officer,” “Electronic Resources and Training Librarian,” and “Assistant Information Advisor. ” Employers represented private, school, and university libraries, as well as legal firms and prisons. Fifty-nine skills were found a total of 1, 021 times across all of the advertisements. Each advertisement averaged 5. 67 requirements. These skills were classified in four categories: professional, generic, personal, and experience. The most highly noted requirement was professional experience, noted 129 times, followed by interpersonal/communication skills (94), general computing skills (63), enthusiasm (48), and team-working skills (39). Professional skills were noted just slightly more than generic and personal skills in the top twenty skills found. Other professional skills that were highly noted were customer service skills (34), chartership (30), cataloguing/classification/metadata skills (25), and information retrieval skills (20). Some notable skills that occurred rarely included Web design and development skills (6), application of information technology in the library (5), and knowledge management skills (3). Conclusion – Professional, generic, and personal qualities were all important to employers in the U. K.; however, without experience, possessing these qualities may not be enough for new professionals in the field...|$|E
