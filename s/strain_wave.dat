40|$|Elasticity is an {{important}} physical property of material. In the clinical practice, elasticity is used for physical examination in several ways, such as palpation or percussion. Differences in elasticity can help facilitate the diagnosis of tumors and their extent. Elasticity is an essential property in the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, or soft degeneration in tissue necrosis. In addition, information of tissue elasticity is utilized in virtual reality systems such as telepalpation and computer assisted surgery. It was difficult to obtain such properties in vivo by using conventional measurement methods. To overcome this problem, magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) has been developed that provides noninvasive in vivo measurements of elasticity for human tissue. We summarize this MRE method in this paper. When an object is oscillated from the surface in a known frequency, acoustic <b>strain</b> <b>waves</b> propagate into the material and one can calculate the physical constants of a material elasticity by the wave velocity. In MRE measurements, a cyclic micromotion caused by the acoustic <b>strain</b> <b>waves</b> is obtained as an MR image that is synchronized to the oscillation. By measuring the local wavelength of the <b>strain</b> <b>waves,</b> we can obtain the elasticity constants. Several examples of MRE image including in vivo measurements are provided {{as well as several}} methods to estimate the local wavelength from MRE images are described in this paper. 1...|$|R

50|$|<b>Strain</b> <b>wave</b> gearing {{also known}} as Harmonic Drive is a special type of {{mechanical}} gear system that can improve certain characteristics compared to traditional gearing systems such as helical gears or planetary gears. It was invented in 1957 by C.W. Musser {{while he was a}} research advisor at United Shoe Machinery (USM). The advantages include: no backlash, compactness and light weight, high gear ratios, reconfigurable ratios within a standard housing, good resolution and excellent repeatability when repositioning inertial loads, high torque capability, and coaxial input and output shafts. High gear reduction ratios are possible in a small volume (a ratio from 30:1 up to 320:1 is possible in the same space in which planetary gears typically only produce a 10:1 ratio).Disadvantages include a tendency for 'wind-up' (a torsional spring rate) in the low torque region. <b>Strain</b> <b>wave</b> gears are typically used in industrial motion control, machine tool, printing machine, robotics and aerospace, for gear reduction but may also be used to increase rotational speed, or for differential gearing.|$|E

The major axis of the flex spline's ellipse rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point {{at the same rate as}} the wave generator's shaft. The key to the design of the <b>strain</b> <b>wave</b> gear is that there are fewer teeth (often for example two fewer) on the flex spline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flex spline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth in this example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flex spline in the opposite direction.|$|E
50|$|The <b>strain</b> <b>wave</b> gearing {{theory is}} based on elastic {{dynamics}} and utilizes the flexibility of metal. The mechanism has three basic components: a wave generator, a flexspline, and a circular spline. More complex versions have a fourth component normally used to shorten the overall length or to increase the gear reduction within a smaller diameter, but still follow the same basic principles.The wave generator {{is made up of}} two separate parts: an elliptical disk called a wave generator plug and an outer ball bearing. The gear plug is inserted into the bearing, giving the bearing an elliptical shape as well.The flexspline is like a shallow cup. The sides of the spline are very thin, but the bottom is thick and rigid. This results in significant flexibility of the walls at the open end due to the thin wall, but in the closed side being quite rigid and able to be tightly secured (to a shaft, for example). Teeth are positioned radially around the outside of the open end of the flexspline. The flexspline fits tightly over the wave generator, so that when the wave generator plug is rotated, the flexspline deforms to the shape of a rotating ellipse but does not rotate with the wave generator.The circular spline is a rigid circular ring with teeth on the inside. The flexspline and wave generator are placed inside the circular spline, meshing the teeth of the flexspline and the circular spline. Because the flexspline has an elliptical shape, its teeth only actually mesh with the teeth of the circular spline in two regions {{on opposite sides of the}} flexspline, along the major axis of the ellipse.Assume that the wave generator is the input rotation. As the wave generator plug rotates, the flexspline teeth which are meshed with those of the circular spline change. The major axis of the flexspline actually rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point at the same rate as the wave generator. The key to the design of the <b>strain</b> <b>wave</b> gear is that there are fewer teeth (for example two fewer) on the flexspline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flexspline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth, for example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flexspline in the opposite direction.For a <b>strain</b> <b>wave</b> gearing mechanism, the gearing reduction ratio can be calculated from the number of teeth on each gear: For example, if there are 202 teeth on the circular spline and 200 on the flexspline, the reduction ratio is (200 − 202)/200 = −0.01Thus the flexspline spins at 1/100 the speed of the wave generator plug and in the opposite direction. This allows different reduction ratios to be set without changing the mechanism's shape, increasing its weight, or adding stages. The range of possible gear ratios is limited by tooth size limits for a given configuration.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the stress state of a wire rope is tedious although analytical solution {{of a simple}} rope subjected to static load is available. While facing the problems involving complex ropes, it is usual practice to take approximations based upon the concepts of an average stress state for the constitutive ropes or for every wire. For a statically loaded cable superimposed with a tensile impulse, practically in sudden lifting of a heavy weight, the coupled axial-shearing <b>strain</b> <b>waves</b> in the cable has rarely been studied and explored through analytical approaches. Based on Costello's force-deformation relationship and elastic wave propagation theory, analysis procedures and results are presented in this paper. Time-dependent coupled axial-torsional displacements and axial-shearing <b>strain</b> <b>waves</b> in a simple straight wire rope, due to a longitudinal impact at one end, are obtained.

Strain-induced magnetization changes have previously been demonstrated in ferroelectric/ferromagnetic heterostructures, with excellent fidelity between the ferromagnet and the ferroelectric domains, but these experiments were limited to essentially dc frequencies. Both magneto-optical Kerr effect and polarized neutron reflectivity confirm that the traveling <b>strain</b> <b>wave</b> does rotate the magnetization away from the long axis direction and both yield quantitatively similar values for the rotated magnetization. An investigation {{of the behavior of}} short axis magnetization with increasing <b>strain</b> <b>wave</b> amplitude on a series of samples with variable edge roughness suggests that the magnetization reorientation that is seen proceeds solely via coherent rotation.

40|$|Generally, {{measurements}} of the stress-strain curve are {{required in order to}} determine the yield strength. However, it is difficult to measure dynamic stresses induced in materials due to the complicated propagation of the stress waves. In contrast to this, measuring strain data is relatively easy. When the materials are subjected to impact force, elastic waves propagate first. After the strain becomes larger than yield <b>strain,</b> plastic <b>waves</b> occur. Therefore the strain rate changes discontinuously at this point, although the strain increases smoothly. By measuring the <b>strain</b> <b>waves</b> induced in a test piece rod subjected to longitudinal impact force as a step waveform, the strain rate profiles are obtained based on numerical differentiation. For the previous reason, the dynamic yield point can be estimated by change of the strain rate.
