40|$|If you are lucky, you’ve {{never been}} on the {{receiving}} end of a Vice President discovering that a large investment in testing hasn’t paid off in improved quality. A test manager at a company is about to get unlucky. Chuck is the test manager for a small startup software company. He has a lot of experience setting up and running test groups. Susan is the Vice President to whom Chuck reports. Chuck stood in the doorway to Susan’s office. “You wanted to see me?” “Yes. I just got out of the executive staff meeting. ” Susan motioned Chuck to come in and sit down. “We were discussing the recent increase in customer complaints. ” Chuck took a seat across the desk from Susan, “I’d heard about that. As you can imagine, I’m not too pleased. ” “Neither are the other executives; they had a few pointed questions for me about how this happened. So now I need answers. We’ve given you a well-stocked lab, you’ve hired a large team of experienced professionals, you’ve brought in training for them, and you’ve established good test practices. With all this investment in testing, how is it that our software is worse?” How Did It Happen? So what happened to Chuck? How did he end up <b>sitting</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> from Susan explaining why all the work he’d done to improve the testing had not paid off? Before Chuck arrived, the testing had been done by a handful of largely untrained testers. “If you can’t adequately test the software with the team you have, ” Susan had directed Chuck, “hire more testers!” Chuck hired more testers. He quadrupled the size of the team. He established better test practices, documented the tests, and trained his team. The developers were ecstatic to see the test team growing by leaps and bounds. “This is great! They’ll find all the bugs,” they said, and merrily continued coding. The death spiral had begun. The Software Death Spiral Chuck slumped in his seat as Susan asked the question. “I know. I’ve been trying to figure this out myself ever since I heard about the problems in the field. ” “Did we just miss the bugs? ” Susan asked...|$|E

50|$|Smallfoot {{itself was}} the result of a number of {{internal}} and external projects that Richards was working on at the time. The initial idea behind Smallfoot came from a project that he was working on to build a custom Linux distribution, based on Red Hat 5 for Linetex Computers based in Woking and a project that a colleague <b>sitting</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> room was working on for Deutsche Bahn (an embedded OpenServer solution for platform messaging).|$|R

Instead, he was a slight man. Looking at me from <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> he seemed humble and friendly. It was probably the shortest interview on record.” ...|$|R

5000|$|Fakelaki or fakellaki is the phonetic {{transliteration}} of the Greek word φακελάκι.

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] he said. [...] "I can't {{pretend to}} account for these astounding views you have acquired--and I am using a mild term. Let me say this: (he leaned forward a little, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk)</b> I demand that you be specific.

Less accepting of the kid's abrasive manners are a couple <b>sitting</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> aisle. After some animated exchanges, the kid leaves to get something from the buffet cart. At this time, Donnelly inquires, and finds out that the couple had just lost their son from a cot death.|$|R

5000|$|In Greek, fakelaki means [...] "little envelope" [...] but is {{also used}} in Greek popular culture as a jargon term {{referring}} to the bribery of public servants and private companies by Greek citizens in order to [...] "expedite" [...] service.

6000|$|Owe him! thought I--what do I owe him but a grudge, but I {{concealed}} my resentment; and presently he said, [...] "By {{running away}} from the ship in Liverpool, you forfeited your wages, which amount to twelve dollars; and as there has been advanced to you, in money, hammers, and scrapers, seven dollars and seventy-five cents, you are therefore indebted to me in precisely that sum.

60|$|When our Italian hosts {{had offered}} me wine {{in a general}} sort of way, I had declined. My beer {{experience}} had been enough for me, and I had no inclination to traffic further in the stuff, or in anything related to it. Unfortunately, one young Italian, Peter, an impish soul, seeing me sitting solitary, stirred by a whim of the moment, half-filled a tumbler with wine and passed it to me. He was <b>sitting</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table from me. I declined. His face grew stern, and he insistently proffered the wine.

6000|$|... "'Jeff,' she says, soft like, 'I've been {{a foolish}} girl. I've looked at {{things from the}} wrong side. I never felt this way before. Men get hungry every day like this, don't they?

You said once--that is, you asked me--you wanted me to--well, Jeff, if you still care--I'd be glad and willing to have you always <b>sitting</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table from me.

6000|$|I {{followed}} him. Still frowning, he went <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> {{and took}} out a small pack of patience cards. Then he drew up a chair to the table, and, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses! ...|$|R
