40|$|Literature about {{doctoral}} supervision has {{concentrated on}} describing the ever lengthening lists of functions {{that must be}} carried out. This functional approach is necessary {{but there has been}} little exploration of a different paradigm, a conceptual approach towards research supervision. This paper, based on interviews with supervisors from a range of disciplines, aims to fill this a gap. The main concepts identified are: Functional: where the issue is one of project management; enculturation: where the <b>student</b> <b>is</b> <b>encouraged</b> to {{become a member of the}} disciplinary community; critical thinking: where the <b>student</b> <b>is</b> <b>encouraged</b> to question and analyse their work; emancipation: where the <b>student</b> <b>is</b> <b>encouraged</b> to question and develop themselves; and developing a quality relationship: where the <b>student</b> <b>is</b> enthused, inspired and cared for. Supervisors of doctoral <b>students</b> <b>are</b> also trying to reconcile the tensions between their professional role as an academic and their personal self as well as encouraging students to move a long a path towards increasing independence. The concepts are examined in the light of each of these tensions. Finally the research illuminates the power of the supervisor’s own experience as a student and the paper suggests that supervisors need to be aware of both the positive and negative aspects of each of these conceptual approaches. </p...|$|R
