40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the Hydrology Conference 2010, San Diego, California, USA, 11 - 13 October 2010 We investigated whether the Vietnam War bombing and conflict-induced exodus could have altered the hydrological behaviour of the Mekong Basin. The rainfall-runoff relationship was analysed in 2 catchments over period 1960 - 2004 (figure 1). In each catchment, rainfall and runoff time series together with potential evapotranspiration were used as input to run GR 2 M monthly water balance model whose robustness is adapted to data-scarce conditions. The space-time distribution of densities of bombs dropped during the war was derived from UXO-NRA database which records the amount and type of ordnances and the aircraft types and <b>numbers</b> <b>per</b> <b>US</b> Air Force sorties from 1965 to 1973. Bomb-induce damages inflicted on vegetation was estimated using the Bomb Damage Assessment Report. We found that the delivery of about 1. 5 million tons of high-explosive ordnances likely caused profound damage to {{one third of the}} southern catchment whose runoff increased by > 365 mm/year during at least 4 years after bombing climaxed in 1972. The magnitude of this increase was found to be consistent with usual tropical forest transpiration rates over the bomb-cleared surface area. No hydrological change was observed during this period in the 30 -fold-less bombed catchment located in the North. From 1995 onward, southern and northern catchments' runoff productions are significantly higher and lower than in pre-war conditions, respectively. These hydrological shifts are most likely attributed to permanent changes in the vegetation cover, either denser in the northern sub-catchment (in response to the extensive abandonment of cultivated lands) or sparser in the southern catchment (as a result of bomb-degraded soil conditions). These results illustrate the high responsiveness of flow regime to forest cover changes in tropical areas where deforestation is expected to perpetuate at a high rate over the coming decades...|$|R
40|$|Tornadoes cause loss of {{life and}} damage to {{property}} {{each year in the}} United States and around the world. The largest impacts come from ‘outbreaks’ consisting of multiple tornadoes closely spaced in time. Here we find an upward trend in the annual mean <b>number</b> of tornadoes <b>per</b> <b>US</b> tornado outbreak for the period 1954 – 2014. Moreover, the variance of this quantity is increasing more than four times as fast as the mean. The mean and variance of the <b>number</b> of tornadoes <b>per</b> outbreak vary according to Taylor’s power law of fluctuation scaling (TL), with parameters that are consistent with multiplicative growth. Tornado-related atmospheric proxies show similar power-law scaling and multiplicative growth. Path-length-integrated tornado outbreak intensity also follows TL, but with parameters consistent with sampling variability. The observed TL power-law scaling of outbreak severity means that extreme outbreaks are more frequent than would be expected if mean and variance were independent or linearly related...|$|R

Dialysis-related HTN is predominantly caused by chronic volume overload, and as such the blood pressure (BP) can be reduced and/or brought down to normal in a sizable number of patients with improved salt and fluid balance. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of HTN among children on hemodialysis (HD) and to evaluate the correlation of HTN with some demographic data. This is a prospective study performed on forty pediatric patients with CKD receiving maintenance HD in three centers in Baghdad. HTN was defined as BP ≥ 95 th percentile for age, height, and sex or use of antihypertensive medications. HTN was recorded in 27 patients on HD (67. 5 %), while the BP was normal in the other 13 patients (32. 5 %). There was no significant correlation between HTN and gender, age, or etiology of CKD.

40|$|To {{study the}} effects of {{different}} plant density on seed yield and yield components of three spring rapeseed cultivars a factorial experiment based on a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications and 9 treatments was carried out during 2011 in Qazvin, Iran. Each plot consisted of 4 rows, 6 m long with 60 cm between rows. Seed were sown by hand (without pre planting irrigation) on February 2. Application of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and irrigation regime in this experiment were processed as they are usually done in the region. Three rapeseed cultivars Hayola 401 ، RGS 003 and Sarigol with three plant density levels (60, 80 and 100 plant/m 2) were studied. At the end of growing period, traits like silique <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, seed <b>number</b> <b>per</b> silique and 1000 seed weight, seed yield and seed oil percent were measured. The results showed that plant density and cultivars affected silique <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, seed <b>number</b> <b>per</b> silique, 1000 seed weight and seed yield significantly. The effects of plant density by interaction on silique <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, seed <b>number</b> <b>per</b> silique and seed yield were also significant. Hayola 401 produced the highest silique <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, seed <b>number</b> <b>per</b> silique, 1000 seed weight and seed yield. In these three cultivars under study the highest seed yield was obtained with the plant density of 80 plant/m 2. Increasing plant density from 80 to 100 plants/m 2 decreased silique <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, seed <b>number</b> <b>per</b> silique, 1000 seed weight and seed yield.

An understanding of the interrelationships between important agronomic traits and yield of winter wheat could help to improve breeding results. The objectives of this paper were to examine correlations between several winter wheat traits and their direct and indirect effects on kernel yield. Research work was conducted during two growing seasons in East Croatia (2005 / 06 and 2006 / 07) on 11 winter wheat genotypes. Nine genotypes were advanced breeding lines and two registrated Croatian cultivars Žitarka and Srpanjka. Six traits were included in investigation: ear <b>number</b> <b>per</b> m 2, plant height, <b>number</b> of spikelets <b>per</b> ear, <b>number</b> of kernels <b>per</b> ear, 1000 kernel weight and kernel yield.
