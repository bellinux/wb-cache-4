50|$|TFA is the {{precursor}} {{to many other}} fluorinated compounds such as trifluoroacetic anhydride, trifluoroperacetic acid, and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol.

50|$|In {{chemistry}} phosphines are L-type ligands. They {{are used}} as ligands for many metal complexes.

Unlike most metal ammine complexes, metal phosphine complexes tend to be lipophilic, displaying good <b>solubility</b> <b>in</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents.</b> They also are compatible with metals in multiple oxidation states. Because of these two features, metal phosphine complexes are useful in homogeneous catalysis. Prominent examples of metal phosphine complexes include Wilkinson's catalyst (Rh(PPh3)3Cl), Grubbs' catalyst, and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0).|$|E

5000|$|Unsubstituted phthalocyanine, {{abbreviated}} , {{and many}} of its complexes have very low <b>solubility</b> <b>in</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents.</b> Benzene at 40 °C dissolves less than a milligram of [...] or CuPc per litre. [...] or CuPc dissolve easily in sulfuric acid due to the protonation of the nitrogen atoms bridging the pyrrole rings.

Substituted phthalocyanine complexes often have much higher solubility. They are less thermally stable and often can not be sublimed. Unsubstituted phthalocyanines strongly absorb light between 600 and 700 nm, thus these materials are blue or green. Substitution can shift the absorption towards longer wavelengths, changing the color from pure blue to green to colorless (when the absorption is in the near infrared).|$|E
5000|$|Approximately 25% of all {{artificial}} organic pigments are phthalocyanine derivatives. [...] Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) dyes {{are produced}} by introducing solubilizing groups, such as one or more sulfonic acid functions.

Direct blue 86 is the sodium salt of CuPc-sulfonic acid, whereas direct blue 199 is the quaternary ammonium salt of the CuPc-sulfonic acid. The quaternary ammonium salts of these sulfonic acids are used as solvent dyes because of their <b>solubility</b> <b>in</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents,</b> e.g. Solvent Blue 38 and Solvent Blue 48. The dye derived from cobalt phthalocyanine and an amine is Phthalogen Dye IBN. 1,3-Diiminoisoindolene, the intermediate formed during phthalocyanine manufacture, used in combination with a copper salt affords the dye GK 161.
