5|$|Coastal Command {{had agreed}} to provide three {{squadron}}s of Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers. The Fleet Air Arm (FAA) contributed one squadron of Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers. RAF Bomber Command had some 300 bombers on standby for any operation. There were problems, however. The Swordfish were very slow, and fighter escort of the aircraft was difficult. The Beaufort squadrons were all <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> {{it was difficult to}} bring them together. One squadron was based at Leuchers, Scotland, one at Thorney Island, Portsmouth, England, and one near St Eval, Cornwall, England.|$|E
5|$|Downburst winds {{can produce}} {{numerous}} hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms. Downburst winds are generally very powerful, {{and are often}} mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes, due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal characteristic. Downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable, incomplete, or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings. Agricultural crops, and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged. Aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash. Automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds. Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it, due to their higher density. When these downdrafts reach the surface, they <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.|$|E

25|$|When the {{population}} is <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> running low, pupation can take place under flaps of bark, in crevices, under branches, on the ground, and in other places where larvae rested. During periods when population numbers are dense, pupation is not restricted to these locations, but can take place in sheltered and open locations, even exposed on the trunks of trees or on foliage of nonhost trees. Usually, the caterpillars create flimsy cocoons made of silk strands holding the leaf together, while others do not cover their pupae in cocoons, but rather hang from a twig or tree bark, like butterfly pupae do.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most large}} igneous provinces, the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province has {{its origins in}} a mantle plumean {{upwelling}} zone of abnormally hot rock within the Earth's mantle. As {{the head of the}} Mackenzie plume encountered the Earth's lithosphere, it <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> melted catastrophically to form large volumes of basaltic magma. This resulted {{in the creation of a}} stationary volcanic zone west of Victoria Island that experienced considerable volcanism known as the Mackenzie hotspot. Evidence for the Mackenzie hotspot include the existence of the giant mafic Mackenzie dike swarm because of its fanning pattern adjacent to the Muskox intrusion.|$|E
25|$|Membership {{data on a}} {{relatively}} new, worldwide religion are difficult to arrive at. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organised community, but the Bahá'í population is <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> not in a majority anywhere. Populations are not assigned a Bahá'í religious adherence by birth, {{as is the case}} with other major religions such as Islam and Christianity. Few religious surveys include the Bahá'í Faith due to the high sample size required to reduce the margin of error, and those that have included the Bahá'í Faith are known to underestimate or overinflate many proportionally small groups. Additionally, Bahá'í membership data does not break out active participation from the total number of people who have expressed their belief.|$|E

25|$|The town is {{a mixture}} of three, four and five-room HDB flats. The {{majority}} of the flats are four-room-ed, with a few being five and three.

Blocks numbers with 2 as the first digit, are more <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> generally larger in size. However, even blocks numbers starting with 2 are further categorised;25_ tend to be the largest flats in the whole estate, with flat sizes ranging from 1650sq feet to 1700sq feet, one of the largest HDB flats in Singapore. Other numbers tend to be smaller and are usually from 1300sq feet to 1500sq feet. Sin Ming Ville (Block 22-26) is excluded from this category.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} small {{immigrant}} communities of Spaniards, Italians, Basque and Lebanese. African slaves were imported to Mexico through the Veracruz port. At one point, they outnumbered Europeans {{and a significant}} number ran away from haciendas and plantations to form their own communities, sometimes allied with indigenous groups. One such rebellion was led by Yanga, who successfully negotiated a free African community with Spanish authorities in 1609. Like other groups, many of African descent would intermarry with other groups, with the category of “mulatto” existing in the old colonial caste system for those with African blood. Today, {{the vast majority of}} Afro Mexicans in Veracruz {{and other parts of the}} country are <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> intermixed with the rest of the population.|$|E
25|$|During the Middle Stone Age, {{technological}} advancements allowed humans originating in East Africa {{to adapt to}} new and diverse areas and allowed them to <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> settle most of the African continent. Another motivator for the East African exodus was the expanding population that was growing exponentially. It was also during this era that humans {{are thought to have}} first traveled out of Africa; to Southwest Asia (also known as the Middle East), Asia and to Southeast Europe by traveling across the Sinai Peninsula and land bridges across the Red Sea, and to Western Europe by crossing at Gibraltar. Indeed, by the 10th millennium BC, there was substantial occupation of the upper part of Africa including large populations in what was then a region of lush forest: the Sahara.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{distinct}} dialects (murre s. murteet pl. in Finnish) of the Finnish language spoken in Finland, although the exclusive use of the standard Finnish (yleiskieli)—both in its formal written (kirjakieli) and more casual spoken (puhekieli) form—in Finnish schools, in the media, and in popular culture, along with internal migration and urbanization, have considerably diminished the use of regional varieties, especially since the middle of the 20th century. Historically, there were three dialects: the South-Western (Lounaismurteet), Tavastian (Hämeen murre), and Karelian (Karjalan murre). These and neighboring languages mixed with each other in various ways as the population <b>spread</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> evolved into the Southern Ostrobothnian (Etelä-Pohjanmaan murre), Central Ostrobothnian (Keski-Pohjanmaan murre), Northern Ostrobothnian (Pohjois-Pohjanmaan murre), Far-Northern (Peräpohjolan murre), Savonian (Savon murre), and South-Eastern (Kaakkois-Suomen murteet) aka South Karelian (Karjalan murre) dialects.|$|E
25|$|A simple linear {{polarizer}} {{can be made}} by tilting a stack of glass plates at Brewster's angle to the beam. Some of the s-polarized light is reflected from each surface of each plate. For a stack of plates, each reflection depletes the incident beam of s-polarized light, leaving a greater fraction of p-polarized light in the transmitted beam at each stage. For visible light in air and typical glass, Brewster's angle is about 57°, and about 16% of the s-polarized light present in the beam is reflected for each air-to-glass or glass-to-air transition. It takes many plates to achieve even mediocre polarization of the transmitted beam with this approach. For a stack of 10 plates (20 reflections), about 3% (=(1-0.16)20) of the s-polarized light is transmitted. The reflected beam, while fully polarized, is <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> may not be very useful.|$|E
25|$|However, {{before they}} could emerge the hoot of a car horn was heard to the north west.

The rebels <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> rushed along the Slane road to stop the convoy reaching Rath Cross and spreading out. The RIC reinforcements took heavy fire from the rebels from all sides. The firefight lasted many hours before volunteer reinforcements arrived from Boranstown. The RIC eventually surrendered to the volunteers. However given that the uprising in Dublin had been put down the Fingal volunteers eventually gave themselves up two days later. Thomas Ashe and his men were sentenced to death for their part in the attack, but this was later commuted to penal servitude for life.|$|E
