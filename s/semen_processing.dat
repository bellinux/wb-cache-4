40|$|To {{assess the}} effect of leukocytospermia and <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> on sperm DNA and mitochondria. Twenty-two {{patients}} with and 41 without leukocytospermia were included. Sperm DNA fragmentation was assessed by the Comet assay, and mitochondrial activity by a colorimetric method for active mitochondria. Semen was processed using Percoll, and motility, DNA fragmentation, and mitochondrial activity were analyzed pre- and post-processing. No differences were observed in age, abstinence, volume, sperm morphology, progressive motility, concentration, and vitality (p > 0. 10). Variables were grouped according to time (pre- vs post-processing) and group (leukocytospermia vs non-leukocytospermia) because no interactions could be observed. Leukocytospermia was associated to increased DNA fragmentation, while <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> led to a decrease in DNA fragmentation and to increased mitochondrial activity. While <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> selects sperm with higher rates of DNA integrity independent of {{the presence or absence}} of leukocytes in semen, samples without leukocytospermia present more sperm without DNA fragmentation. <b>Semen</b> <b>processing</b> also selects sperm with higher mitochondrial activity.

40|$|Semen {{cryopreservation}} {{and artificial}} insemination (AI) {{are the most}} important biotechnological techniques presently applied in animal breeding.

40|$|Substantial {{dilution}} of boar <b>semen</b> during <b>processing</b> {{decreased the}} concentration of seminal plasma, perhaps contributing to the decline in sperm quality after cryopreservation and sex-sorting. Results of replacing seminal plasma in investigations from many laboratories have been contradictory. Results and discussion here suggest that whereas membrane status can be influenced by seminal plasma, the action of its various components, both positive and negative, is determined {{in part by the}} membrane status of the spermatozoa to which it is being exposed. Although {{progress has been made in}} identifying components of seminal plasma responsible for its protective effect (notably PSP-I/II spermadhesin for sex-sorted boar spermatozoa), little is known (in any species) regarding how external factors may influence their levels, and their functionality, in seminal plasma. It is noteworthy that seminal plasma is beneficial to post-thaw quality of sex-sorted ram spermatozoa only when added before freezing, not after thawing. Therefore, the action of seminal plasma and its components is dependent on sperm-related factors, in particular the type of processing to which they have been previously exposed. Further research is needed to unravel these biological complexities, and then characterise and synthesise useful proteins within seminal plasma. © 2008...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of pathogens in semen can compromise {{the outcome of}} assisted reproductive treatment, together {{with the possibility of}} the female partner or offspring becoming infected. This is cause for concern, especially in South Africa with a high prevalence of HIV- 1. Most of these infected individuals are in their reproductive years with the desire to have their own genetically related children. Therefore, assisted reproductive treatment with effective risk reduction procedures, such as <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> for the elimination of these pathogens is crucial. However, during sperm preparation by standard discontinuous density gradient centrifugation, the supernatant is aspirated to allow access to the purified sperm pellet. Pathogens from the upper layers can adhere to the inside surface of the test tube and flow down to re-infect the purified sperm sample. The use of a centrifuge tube insert may prevent the re-contamination of sperm samples after discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. Furthermore, seminal pathogens can bind specifically or non-specifically to spermatozoa, rendering semen decontamination procedures ineffective. Serine proteases, such as trypsin, have been demonstrated to effectively inactivate viruses and to break pathogen-sperm bonds. However, the addition of a protease to density gradient layers during <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> could {{have a negative impact on}} sperm parameters. This research was therefore aimed towards the determination of: i) The effect of <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> with trypsin and trypsin inhibitor on sperm parameters. ii) The prevalence of various bacteria in semen samples from men attending the Reproductive and Endocrine Unit at Steve Biko Academic Hospital. iii) The effectiveness of <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation with a centrifuge tube insert, for the elimination of some of the most prevalent bacteria, white blood cells and in vivo derived HIV- 1. Evaluation of sperm parameters after <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> indicated that trypsin and trypsin inhibitor did not have an impact on sperm mitochondrial membrane potential, vitality, motility and zona binding potential, or acrosin activity, respectively. Seminal bacteria were highly prevalent in patients wishing to participate in the Unit’s assisted reproductive program, with 49. 5 % of semen samples presenting with positive bacterial cultures. <b>Semen</b> <b>processing</b> by means of discontinuous density gradient centrifugation with the tube insert, eliminated significantly more in vitro derived (spiked) bacteria and white blood cells from semen compared to processing without the insert. Furthermore, the semen decontamination procedure was effective in removing HIV- 1 RNA from 100 % of samples and proviral DNA from 98. 1 % of semen samples from HIV- 1 sero-positive patients. The effectiveness of discontinuous density gradient centrifugation for the elimination of seminal pathogens could, therefore, be improved by the addition of trypsin to the upper density layer, without supplementing the bottom layer with trypsin inhibitor. Additionally, semen decontamination efficiency could also be improved by the prevention of re-contamination of processed sperm samples by the utilization of a tube insert during discontinuous density gradient centrifugation.

The effects of collection month, average daily ambient temperature and average daily relative humidity on volume, sperm concentration and progressive motility above head of collected semen and also on number of produced artificial insemination straws of required quality were analyzed using statistical analysis (procedures: UNIVARIATE, STEPWISE, GLM) in software SAS 9. 3 (SAS/STAT® 9. 3, 2011). Collection month, average daily ambient temperature, average daily relative humidity, and breed {{had a significant effect}} (P < 0. 05) on all evaluated characteristics. The maximum values of motility and sperm concentration were found in March and in April. The highest volume of collected semen was found in July and in September and the lowest in November, when also the lowest number of straws was produced.

40|$|International {{experience}} has been that cervical insemination of sheep with frozen-thawed semen usually yields unacceptably low pregnancy rates (10 to 30 %). An exceptional case has been Norway where non-return rates in on-farm usage are around 60 %. The objective of the work described in this report was to develop an AI procedure for Irish conditions, based initially on Norwegian protocols, using semen from individual rams. Such a procedure would greatly facilitate and enhance genetic improvement programmes for sheep. The work undertaken had two separate aspects:- (i) studies on <b>semen,</b> including <b>processing</b> and freezing methods, laboratory evaluation of semen quality post thawing {{and the relationship of}} in vitro evaluation to fertilisation rate in vivo (ii) studies on pregnancy rate following AI in relation to issues such as ram breed effects, effects of synchronisation, operator differences and the role of ewe breed inducing the timing of ovulation and various physical and physiological assessments of the cervix at AI. The main results in relation to semen studies were that, while a range of differential staining procedures could be used to objectively evaluate semen with respect to proportion of live speramatozoa and the integrity of sperm cells after thawing, these results were not useful as indicators of fertilisation capacity in vivo. The in vitro fertilisation (IVF) of sheep oocytes recovered from abattoir material gave promising results as a method for evaluating the fertilisation capacity of frozen-thawed semen.

40|$|Capacitation is {{characterized}} by a hyperactivated pattern of sperm motility. The acquisition of highly motility is present {{in the early stages of}} capacitation. Sperm progressive motility is one of the most important parameters for determining the suitability of <b>semen</b> for <b>processing.</b> However, previous studies have shown that some sperm showing good motility have membrane damage. The aim of our study was to characterize the lectin staining pattern on the sperm plasma membrane of unselected and selected human sperm of normozoospermic donors. Sperm selection was performed by the swim-up technique. Fourteen samples from healthy consenting donors classified as normozoospermic according to the World Health Organization were used. We observed changes in the distribution of the carbohydrate residues after the swim-up selection. With Triticum vulgaris, the most abundant pattern was dotted labeling all over the head plasma membrane in the unselected sperm. However, this lectin was distributed homogenously over the acrosomal region after selection. With Arachis hypogaea, the most abundant pattern in fresh sperm was a highly stained acrosomal region. In the highly motility sperm population, the most frequent pattern was dotted fluorescence on the acrosomal region and a highly stained equatorial segment. Meanwhile, with the Aleuria aurantia and Canavalia ensiformis lectins, the most representative patterns were the same before and after the swim-up selection. Our data indicate that modifications which occur in carbohydrate residues during swim-up selection could be important for the regulation of progressive motility and prepare the sperm for capacitation.

40|$|PURPOSE Seminal {{pathogens}} can bind specifically or nonspecifically to spermatozoa, rendering semen {{decontamination procedures}} ineffective, whereby vertical or horizontal {{transmission of the}} infection could occur. Serine proteases have been demonstrated to effectively inactivate viruses and to break pathogen-sperm bonds. However, {{the addition of a}} protease to density gradient layers during <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> could negatively impact on sperm parameters. This study investigated the effect of the addition of a recombinant, human-sequence protease (rhProtease) on sperm parameters during density gradient centrifugation. METHODS (i) Pooled semen samples (n 09) were split and processed by density gradient centrifugation, with the top density layers supplemented, or non-supplemented with rhProtease at three different concentrations (diluted 2, 10 and 20 times). Sperm parameters were then analysed by flow cytometry and computer-assisted semen analyses. (ii) Semen samples (n 05) were split and similarly processed using PureSperm® Pro, with rhProtease in the 40 % density gradient layer, or standard PureSperm® not supplemented with rhProtease (Nidacon, International) respectively. The Hemizona assay was then utilized to compare sperm-zona binding post processing. RESULTS Evaluation of sperm parameters indicated that rhProtease did not, at any of the tested concentrations, have an impact on (i) mitochondrial membrane potential, vitality, motility, or (ii) zona binding potential. CONCLUSION We report that the addition of rhProtease to density gradients is a non-detrimental approach that could improve the effectiveness of <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> for the elimination of seminal pathogens, and benefit assisted reproduction outcome.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study has been the {{development}} of a <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> method allowing the storage of equine semen at a high concentration of 333 million sperm/ml and low volume. Different seminal plasma concentrations were tested to achieve optimum spermatozoal motility. The quality of the new <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> method (protocol 3) was evaluated by comparison with two standard conservation methods often used in the routine laboratory (protocol 1 + 2). Protocol 1 {{is one of the most}} commonly used <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> methods due to its simplicity in implementation. The native semen was diluted directly after collection to 25 million sperm/ml. Protocol 2 is also a frequently applied standard semen conservation method. After dilution 1 + 1 with a semen extender and centrifugation at a force of 600 g for 10 min the bulk of the seminal plasma was removed. The sperm pellet was resuspended and diluted to a concentration of 25 million sperm/ml. Protocol 3 represents the new semen preservation method. The first steps were identical with protocol 2 and included a dilution 1 + 1, semen centrifugation at 600 g for 10 min and the removal of seminal plasma. Unlike protocol 2 the sperm pellet was then diluted to 333 million sperm/ml. Semen storage at that high concentration saves a volume up to 92. 5 % compared with the two conventional <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> methods. After storage the highly concentrated semen was diluted to a final concentration of 25 million sperm/ml. Various concentrations of seminal plasma were added to the extender to investigate the influence of seminal plasma on spermatozoal motility. The study was conducted with 8 stallions of different breeds aged from 3 - 12 years. Six ejaculates of each stallion were used for the experiment. All semen preservation methods were performed with four different extenders. Semen storage took place at the standard temperature for cooled stallion semen at 5 °C. Sperm motility was evaluated subjectively after 0, 24 and 48 h of storage. The present study demonstrates that highly concentrated semen can be used for artificial insemination. The new method is a suitable volume-saving alternative to the conventional semen preservation protocols. A small proportion of autologous seminal plasma in the insemination dose may be beneficial in regard to the multiple functions of seminal plasma in the female reproductive tract. Concerning the spermatozoal movement, there is in the majority of cases no difference between portions without seminal plasma and portions with a small amount of 5 or 20 %. Only a high concentration of 80 % seminal plasma should be avoided because of its negative influence on sperm motility. From the extenders tested in this study, INRA 96 yielded the best results with regard to sperm motility. BotuSemen and Gent are also well suited for the shipment of equine semen, however they were most times inferior to INRA 96. EquiPro is the extender that preserves spermatozoal movement worst over a period of 48 h. The study revealed great differences in semen quality among the individual stallions. Therefore it is recommendable to adapt the conservation method, the seminal plasma concentration and the extender type to the individual sire...|$|E

Materials and Methods: The study compared two different hygienic procedures during the collection, evaluation and <b>processing</b> of <b>semen</b> in Central Semen Station, Anjora, Durg. Routinely used materials including artificial vagina (AV) inner liner, cone, semen collection tube, buffer, extender/diluter, straws; and the laboratory environment like processing lab, pass box and laminar air flow (LAF) cabinet of extender preparation lab, processing lab, sealing filling machine, and bacteriological lab were subjected to bacteriological examination in two phases of study using two different sanitary protocols. Bacterial load in above items/environment was measured using standard plate count method and expressed as colony forming unit (CFU). Results: Bacterial load in a laboratory environment and AV equipments during two different sanitary protocol in {{present investigation}} differed highly significantly (p< 0. 001). Potential sources of bacterial contamination during <b>semen</b> collection and <b>processing</b> included laboratory environment like processing lab, pass box, and LAF cabinets; AV equipments, including AV Liner and cone. Bacterial load was reduced highly significantly (p< 0. 001) in AV liner (from 2. 33 ± 0. 67 to 0. 50 ± 0. 52), cone (from 4. 16 ± 1. 20 to 1. 91 ± 0. 55), and extender (from 1. 33 ± 0. 38 to 0) after application of improved practices of packaging, handling, and sterilization in Phase II of study. Glasswares, buffers, and straws showed nil bacterial contamination in both the phases of study.

40|$|Artificial {{insemination}} (AI) is {{the preferred}} method for reproduction {{in the majority of}} the intensive pig production systems Worldwide. To this end, fresh extended ready-to-use semen doses are either purchased from AI-centres or produced by boars kept on-farm. For profitable semen production, it is necessary to obtain a maximum amount of high quality semen from each boar. This paper reviews current knowledge on factors that may affect semen quality by influencing the boar or the <b>semen</b> during <b>processing.</b> Genetic markers could be used for early detection of boars with the highest fertility potential. Genetic selection for fast growth might jeopardize semen quality. Early detection of boars no longer fit for semen production might be possible by ultrasonography of the testes. Seasonal variation in sperm quality could be associated with changes in photoperiod and heat stress during summer. Comfortable housing, with appropiate bedding material to avoid locomotion problems is essential. In some areas, cooling systems may be necessary to avoid heat stress. The sperm quality can be manipulated by feeding strategies aiming, for instance, to increase sperm resistance to oxidative stress and extend storage duration. High collection frequency will negatively influence sperm quality. Also, if collection is not hygienically performed it will result in bacterial contamination of the semen doses. The concern over bacterial contamination has risen not only because of its negative effect on semen quality but also due to the detection of antimicrobial resistance in isolates from extended semen. Moreover, bacterial and viral pathogens must be monitored because they affect semen production and quality and constitute a risk of herd infection. During processing, boar sperm are submitted to many stress factors that can cause oxidative stress and capacitation-like changes potentially reducing their fertility potential. Dilution rate or dilution temperature affects the quality of the semen doses. Some packaging might preserve semen better than others and some plastic components might be toxic for sperm.

40|$|Malfunction of {{the male}} {{reproductive}} system might be a sensitive marker of environmental hazards, the effects of which may extend beyond reproductive function. The testis is more vulnerable to heat and ionising radiation than any other organ {{of the body and}} several xenobiotics are known to disrupt spermatogenesis after low level exposure. Studies of environmental impact on human health are often most informative and accurate when carried out in the workplace where exposures can be high and easy to document. Semen analysis provides readily obtainable information on testicular function. The main advantages in comparison with functional measures such as fertility rates and time taken to conceive are the possibilities to examine men independently of marriage and pregnancy, to find changes of fecundity with different exposures within the same person and to detect adverse effects when no alteration of fertility is yet taking place. In the implementation of an occupational sperm study considerable attention must be paid to logistic issues. A mobile laboratory unit for initial <b>semen</b> preparation and <b>processing</b> may in some situations increase worker compliance and the quality of sperm cell motility. The cross sectional design which has been used in almost all male reproductive studies so far has several severe limitations including selection bias because of differential participation, difficulties in defining a suitable reference group, and lack of information about the time dimension of the cause-effect relation. The longitudinal design deals adequately with most of these constraints. Semen samples are collected before, during, and possibly after exposure to the risk factor of interest and causal inferences are based upon change of semen variables within a man over time rather than upon differences between men. The logistics of the longitudinal study may benefit from pre-employment health examinations to enrol newly hired workers and require fewer participants to obtain comparable statistical power. In conclusion, andrological methods and epidemiological designs are available for the implementation of valid studies concerned with environmental impact on human testicular function. Occupational sperm studies should probably not be the first choice when the objective is initial screening of environmental impact on fertility but should be implemented when their is a need to corroborate or refuse earlier evidence that specific exposures have impact on testicular function...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{reproductive}} technologies reveal seminal plasma (SP) as a nutritive- protective {{medium for}} spermatozoa suspended in it. This complex physiological fluid contains various organic and inorganic components among which, {{a variety of}} proteins adsorb into plasma membrane during epididymal maturation and at ejaculation, affecting spermatozoal membrane stability and functions including fertilization. The potential influence of SP proteins on male reproduction has drawn attention because of their association with semen freezability and breeding scores in ruminants. Despite the relevance of SP proteins with fertility, studies on their precise natures and factors affecting their quantities and qualities are limited in alpacas. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to evaluate changes in total protein (TP) content and protein profiles (PP) of SP along with semen quality of alpacas maintained with different diets. Five alpaca males were used to collect semen with an artificial vagina. Semen was collected once in a week, over a period of 6 months from March to September, 2009. The study period had four sessions with four types of diets: I. hay; II. hay+ pasture grazing; III. Sheep concentrate (gross protein 16 %, lipids 2. 7 %, fiber 10 %, +pasture grazing; IV. horse concentrate (gross protein 12 %, lipids 3 %, fiber 11 %,) + pasture grazing. After proper evaluation of semen quality, samples were centrifuged (3500 r. p. m., 40 min) to separate SP to perform biochemical study including gel electrophoresis. The SDS electrophoresis was performed using two concentrations of polyacrylamide (14 % and 16 %) in the gel of separation. The gels were colored with cromassie brilliant blue and the intensity was analyzed with Sante Dicom Viewer and Image J program. In this study there were great variations in TP and PP of SP along with semen quality of individual alpacas. TP (g/dl) were 4. 5 ± 4. 04, 3. 21 ± 3. 08, 3. 06 ± 2. 93 and 6. 38 ± 2. 83 in the sessions I, II, III and IV, respectively. Motility and concentration of spermatozoa were lower (18. 5 ± 8. 8 %, 10. 44 ± 23. 35 X 106 /ml respectively) during	session IV. Assessment of the electrophoretic profiles of SP proteins showed a total of 7 bands having molecular weights from 200 to 14. 00 kDa. Surprisingly, all bands were not present in all alpacas SP. Semen from males fed a high quality diet markedly differed and showed protein bands with molecular weights from 10 to 14 kDa and 31 to 45 kDa compared to semen of the other males. Moreover, there were significant changes in the percentage and quantity of similar protein profiles during the four sessions. Protein fractions of low molecular weights (14. 40 to 31. 00 kDa) were highest during session II and this fraction showed a positive correlation with sperm motility and concentration throughout the study. These results demonstrate that there are marked changes in semen quality, TP and PP of SP of alpaca depending on diets. In ruminants, SP proteins vary with individual animal, season of collection, temperature, nutrition and stress, and are originated from seminal vesicles, which are normally absent in camelides. The origin, composition and function of SP proteins remain a mystery in alpacas. For successful preservation of alpaca semen we should define good quality <b>semen</b> before <b>processing</b> by determining the biological and biochemical makeup of SP.

The first section {{of this research was}} aimed towards the evaluation of a sperm swim-up method (SW- 10) while in the second section the feasibility of establishing an IUI programme in Gabon was explored. Methods: The initial section involved three sets of experiments. Semen samples were obtained from patients and donors participating in the Reproductive Biology Laboratory?s research donor registry programme. For experiment (i), semen samples (n= 25) were divided into 3 equal aliquots and processed using three syringes with volumes of 5 ml (SW- 5), 10 ml (SW- 10) and 20 ml (SW- 20), respectively. During experiment (ii), semen samples (n= 20) were split into 2 equal volumes and processed using either the SEP-D kit or the SW- 10 method. In experiment (iii) (n= 20) two sperm preparation methods i. e. the single layer centrifugation (SLC) and the density gradient centrifugation (DGC) were compared. For post-processing analyses, concentration, motility and total motile sperm count (experiments (i), (ii) and (iii)), as well as morphology, viability and DNA integrity (experiment (ii)) were evaluated. Information on the feasibility of establishing an IUI programme in Gabon in the second section was obtained from a questionnaire completed by gynaecologists practising in Gabon. Results: In the first section, experiment (i) indicated a significant increase in motility and concentrations in spermatozoa processed using the SW- 10 method when compared to SW- 5 and SW- 20 (p< 0. 05). Experiment (ii) revealed that the SW- 10 method yielded spermatozoa with significant superior motility and concentration when compared to that obtained using the SEP-D kit (p< 0. 05). The SW- 10 yielded a statistically significant larger number of spermatozoa with intact plasma membranes, DNA content and normal morphology (p< 0. 05). In experiment (iii), semen processed using SLC resulted in spermatozoa with statistically significant higher concentrations. However spermatozoa obtained from the DGC had superior motility. The second section comprised a gynaecological survey conducted in Gabon. Seventeen (85 %) of the 20 registered gynaecologists participated in the survey. Gynaecologists were particularly interested in a basic infertility treatment and training programme, {{as well as in the}} establishment of an ART unit in Libreville. All participants were in agreement that ART services would improve both diagnostic and therapeutic patient services in Gabon. Discussion and conclusion: This study indicated that spermatozoa recovered from the simplified sperm swim-up method had statistically significantly higher sperm parameters when compared to those from the SEP-D kit. <b>Processing</b> <b>semen</b> using SLC resulted in significantly higher sperm concentration when compared to that of the DGC, which yielded a higher percentage of progressively motile spermatozoa. The need to establish an IUI programme in Gabon was proved in the second section of this study. In conclusion, the simplified swim-up method can possibly be an effective low-cost alternative in the preparation of semen samples for IUI procedures. The implementation of low-cost sperm preparation methods can be important in developing countries such as Gabon. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Semen {{preparation}} {{techniques for}} assisted reproduction, including intrauterine insemination (IUI), {{were developed to}} separate the motile morphological normal spermatozoa. Leucocytes, bacteria and dead spermatozoa produce oxygen radicals that negatively influence the ability to fertilize the egg. The yield of as many motile, morphologically normal spermatozoa might influence treatment choices and therefore outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of gradient, swim-up, or wash and centrifugation in subfertile couples undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI) on clinical outcome {{as well as on}} semen parameters. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's trials register (30 June 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2003), EMBASE (1980 to July 2003), Science Direct Database (1966 to July 2003), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), National Research Register (2000 to Issue 2, 2003), Biological Abstracts (2000 to June 2003), CINAHL (1982 to July 2003) and reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted experts and authors in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), comparing the efficacy of semen preparation techniques used for subfertile couples undergoing IUI, were included. RCTs or split sample studies examining semen parameters after different semen preparation techniques were also included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: Two randomised controlled trials comparing clinical outcomes, including 81 participants in total, were included in the meta-analysis (Dodson 1998 -I/ II; Xu 2000 -I/ II). Both studies compared swim-up technique versus gradient technique in 65 subfertile couples undergoing IUI. One study compared the effectiveness of both techniques with wash technique. No trials reported the primary outcome of live birth. There was no statistically significant difference between pregnancy rates (PR) for swim-up versus gradient / wash centrifuge (Peto OR 0. 55, 95 % CI 0. 17 to 1. 76; Peto OR 1. 74, 95 % CI 0. 2 to 14. 9; PR/ couple swim-up 20 %, gradient 40 %, wash 12. 5 %) or gradient versus wash centrifuge (Peto OR 4. 01, 95 % CI 0. 82 to 19. 56; PR/ couple swim-up 15 %, gradient 20 %). There {{was no significant difference in}} the miscarriage rate (MR) per couple between either of the three treatment groups in the one trial reporting this outcome (MR/ couple swim-up 0 %, gradient 10. 3 %, wash 0 %. MR/ pregnancy gradient 30. 3 %). There was no statistically significant difference in the multiple pregnancy rate (MPR) per couple between either of the three treatment groups in Dodson 1998 -I/ II (MPR/ couple swim -up 0 %, gradient 0 %, wash 6. 3 %). One triplet pregnancy was recorded. Fifteen studies comparing <b>semen</b> parameters after <b>processing</b> were included. Two studies were included in the meta-analysis, we were not able to pool results. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific preparation technique. Large high quality randomised controlled trials, comparing the effectiveness of a gradient and/ or a swim-up and/ or wash and centrifugation technique on clinical outcome are lacking. Further randomised trials are warranted. Results from studies comparing semen parameters may suggest a preference for gradient technique, but firm conclusions cannot be drawn and the limitations should be taken into consideratio...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} problems of Artificial Insemination (AI) in Camelidae is its timing {{in relation to}} ovulation in the she-camel. The present article reviewed collection of <b>semen,</b> <b>processing</b> of semen, manipulation of the female and semen deposition technique in Camelidae species. Commonly, semen is collected by electroejaculation, artificial vagina (AV), flushing of the epididymus with saline solution, while the more accepted methods are the former two methods. Semen is usually used in raw condition or after extension, depending on the method of <b>semen</b> <b>processing.</b> In the fresh raw method, whole semen is used within minutes or after few hours. Extension of the semen ejaculate is carried out by adding extenders and it is required in more efficient use of AI, in short-term preservation or liquid semen (within a few hours or days) and long-term preservation or frozen semen (months or years). In short-term preservation, semen is used extended under different temperatures (30, 25 or 4 oC). Long-term preservation is carried out by cryopreservation. Packaging methods such as pellets, ampoules or in plastic straws with different volumes (0. 25, 0. 5 or 4 ml) represent different freezing procedures. The quality and survival of spermatozoa of post-thaw semen are highly variable from one male to the other, even after using the same freezing technique. To ensure that the inseminated females ovulate, hormonal manipulation of ovarian activity is used such as the induction of follicular activity and ovulation, as well as, synchronization of these phases {{in a group of}} females. The best time for insemination can only be determined by ultrasonography and/or rectal palpation of the ovaries. The other alternative is to inseminate at known intervals following induction of ovulation by hormonal treatment with human-chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) ...|$|E
40|$|Ram <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> {{laboratories}} {{are sometimes}} {{confronted with the}} need to use semen of high genetic merit rams with relatively low semen quality. Thus, any method that would increase sperm viability in low viability ejaculates could be useful. In this study the possibility of a glass beads filtration method by estimating the beads Total Surface Provided (TSP) for adhesion of spermatozoa, was evaluated. Initially, two different TSP (102 cm 2 and 154 cm 2) achieved by various sizes of beads (1500, 2000 και 3000 μm in diameter) were tested. No significant difference in sperm viability improvement was noticed for the same TSP by different beads (P> 0. 05). Optimization tests were then performed in which three different funnels were used for filtration at a standard TSP (154 cm 2). The pear shaped funnel was found to be the most appropriate for filtration, since semen volume recovery and sperm viability improvement were more pronounced (P 0. 05). Filtrated spermatozoa were more resistant to the HOS test than the untreated samples in 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours (P< 0. 05). Significant difference between groups in ROS production was detected after 72 hours of storage (P< 0. 05). Analysis of the results revealed that the efficiency of the filtration procedure is increased in the breeding season of rams. Estimation of the reproductive value of the filtrated samples using the Fucntional Sperm Fraction (F. S. F.) index system revealed that the filtrated samples can be used for AI up to 24 hours after their filtration within the breeding season. In conclusion, ram sperm viability improvement by more than 20 % of its initial value και semen volume recovery by more than 60 %, along {{with the fact that the}} total filtration time did not exceed three minutes in any case, suggest that through further development this method could be successfully used during ram <b>semen</b> <b>processing.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Detection of HIV- 1 RNA in semen is used {{commonly}} {{to determine}} the safety of <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> procedures before assisted reproductive technology (ART). Using two panels of prepared semen samples containing HIV- 1 the performances of protocols from 14 centers have been compared. No false-positive results were detected but false-negative results were frequent when the concentration was below 500 HIV- 1 RNA copies/ml of seminal plasma. Frequency of HIV- 1 RNA detection was higher on seminal cells than on seminal plasma. Assays (or protocols) for quantifying HIV- 1 RNA in semen performed less well than standardized blood plasma assays. The HIV load in seminal plasma could be a useful marker {{of the risk of}} sexual transmission of the virus. Its use as a marker of global HAART efficiency in the HIV reservoir needs further study.

40|$|Sperm {{chromatin}} integrity {{has been}} being {{recognized as an}} important factor in male fertility. During normal fertilization, high quality sperm with intact chromatin are selected through natural selection in journey from vagina to fallopian tube. However, using Assisted Reproductive Techniques, particularly ICSI, the natural selection is bypassed. Therefore sperm with DNA breakage have the opportunity to fertilize the egg which may lead to decreased embryo quality and implantation rate. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of sperm chromatin integrity on ICSI outcomes. A total of 200 semen samples were collected from couples undergoing ICSI and were analyzed according to WHO criteria. Each sample was evaluated for sperm chromatin integrity using four cytochemical assays and <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> by swim up method.

40|$|AbstractTo make {{timing of}} {{artificial}} insemination (AI) relative to ovulation less critical, methods for prolonging shelf life of spermatozoa in vivo after AI have been attempted to be developed. Encapsulation of sperm cells is a documented technology, and recently, a technology in which sperm cells {{are embedded in}} alginate gel has been introduced and commercialized. In this study, standard processed semen with the Biladyl extender (control) was compared with semen processed by sperm immobilization technology developed by SpermVital AS in a blind field trial. Moreover, in vitro acrosome and plasma membrane integrity was assessed and compared with AI fertility data for possible correlation. Semen from 16 Norwegian Red young bulls with unknown fertility was collected and processed after splitting the semen in two aliquots. These aliquots were processed with the standard Biladyl extender or the SpermVital extender to a final number of 12  ×  106 and 25  ×  106 spermatozoa/dose, respectively. In total, 2000 semen doses were produced from each bull, divided equally by treatment. Artificial insemination doses were set up to design a blinded AI regime; 5  +  5 straws from each extender within ejaculates in ten-straw goblets were distributed to AI technicians and veterinarians all over Norway. Outcomes of the inseminations were measured as 56 -day nonreturn rate (NRR). Postthaw sperm quality was assessed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide and Alexa 488 –conjugated peanut agglutinin to assess the proportion of plasma membrane and acrosome-intact sperm cells, respectively. In total, data from 14, 125 first inseminations performed over a 12 -month period, 7081 with Biladyl and 7044 with SpermVital semen, {{were used in the}} statistical analyses. There {{was no significant difference in}} 56 -day NRR for the two semen categories, overall NRR being 72. 5 % and 72. 7 % for Biladyl and SpermVital, respectively. The flow cytometric results revealed a significant higher level of acrosome-intact live spermatozoa in Biladyl-processed semen compared to SpermVital semen. The results indicate that the level of acrosome-intact live spermatozoa in the AI dose did not affect the 56 -day NRR for the two <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> methods. In conclusion, this study has showed that immobilized spermatozoa provide equal fertility results as standard processed semen when AI is performed in a blinded field trial, although the immobilization procedure caused increased sperm damage evaluated in vitro compared to standard <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> procedure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the capacity of three <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> techniques, Percoll gradient centrifugation, Swim-up and a combination of Swim-up and Percoll gradient centrifugation, to reduce the viral load of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in experimentally infected semen samples. The evaluation was performed using two approaches: first, searching for the presence of virus in the processed samples (via virus titration and RT-PCR) and second, ascertaining the possible interference on in vitro embryo production. The sperm count and DNA integrity (Comet assay) of the processed samples were analyzed (Experiment 1). The amount of virus in the processed samples was determined by titration in cell culture (Experiment 2). The samples processed by Swim up/Percoll gradient centrifugation were utilized for in vitro embryo production, and the embryos produced were tested for BVDV by RT-PCR (Experiment 3). Sperm concentration, Comet assay and embryo production were analyzed by chi-squared tests (P< 0. 05). There was a significant difference between sperm separation techniques when the sperm count and Comet assay were analyzed. The sperm count obtained from the Swim up/Percoll gradient centrifugation group was lower than that obtained in either of the two other groups (Swim up and Percoll gradient centrifugation), and the Comet assay showed that the combination of the two <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> techniques (Swim up/Percoll gradient) produced a 1. 1 % prevalence of Comet level 2, which was not observed in the other groups. The BVDV titer (106. 68 TCID 50 /mL) added to experimentally infected semen samples decreased after Percoll gradient centrifugation to 102. 3 – 101 TCID 50 /mL; for the Swim up group, the titer range was 103. 3 – 101. 87 TCID 50 /mL, and in the Swim up/Percoll gradient centrifugation group, BVDV was undetectable. The decreases in titer varied from 99. 9 % in the Swim up-processed group to 100 % in the Swim up/Percoll gradient centrifugation group. In vitro embryo production displayed similar blastocyst development rates among all groups, and RT-PCR was negative for the produced embryos. The data showed that the combination of Swim up/Percoll gradient centrifugation promoted the elimination of BVDV from the semen samples without damaging spermatozoa cells and also allowed successful in vitro embryo production free of BVDV. Hence, the risk of BVDV contamination is negligible for the embryo recipient...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Prolonged {{survival}} of patients under HAART {{has resulted in}} new demands for assisted reproductive technologies. HIV serodiscordant couples wish {{to make use of}} assisted reproduction techniques in order to avoid viral transmission to the partner or to the newborn. It is therefore essential to test the effectiveness of techniques aimed at reducing HIV and HCV loads in infected semen using molecular biology tests. METHODS: After seminal analysis, semen samples from 20 coinfected patients were submitted to cell fractioning and isolation of motile spermatozoa by density gradient centrifugation and swim-up. HIV and HCV RNA detection tests were performed with RNA obtained from sperm, seminal plasma and total semen. RESULTS: In pre-washing semen, HIV RNA was detected in 100 % of total semen samples, whereas HCV RNA was concomitantly amplified in only one specimen. Neither HIV nor HCV were detected either in the swim-up or in the post-washing semen fractions. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of HIV and/or HCV shedding in semen by density gradient centrifugation followed by swim-up is an efficient method. These findings lead us to believe that, although semen is rarely found to contain HCV, <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> is highly beneficial for HIV/HCV coinfected individuals...|$|E

Aliquots of neat semen were submitted for viral validation by qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Semen samples were processed by density gradient centrifugation in combination with a ProInsert™ tube after which aliquots of the processed sperm samples were analysed for the presence of HIV- 1. Fifty-four percent of all tested neat semen samples tested positive for HIV- 1 DNA, RNA or both (13. 4 %, 11. 3 % and 29. 0 %, respectively).

Settings: This study was done at tertiary care center attached to Reproductive Medicine Unit and Medical College. Design: Prospective pilot study. Patients: Normozoospermic men (n = 50) undergoing diagnostic semen analysis. Materials and Methods: Normozoospermic samples (World Health Organization, 2010 criteria) after analysis was divided into two aliquots (0. 5 mL each); one was processed at 37 °C and the other at RT by swim-up method. DNA fragmentation of both samples post wash was calculated by acridine orange method. Statistical Analysis Used: The values of sperm DNA fragmentation were represented as mean and standard error (mean ± SEM) of the mean. Paired t-test was used for calculating the sperm DNA integrity difference between post wash at RT and 37 °C. Results: Statistically significant difference was not observed in post wash sperm DNA fragmentation values at 37 °C compared to RT.

40|$|We {{designed}} prospective {{studies to}} compare manual and computerized analysis of sperm morphology by strict criteria using different <b>semen</b> <b>processing</b> and staining techniques. A total of 54 semen samples were studied; slides were prepared from each subject from liquefied semen and after washing, and stained with Diff-Quik® or Papanicolaou. An intra-laboratory, blind assessment was performed manually (two observers) {{and using a}} computerized analyser (two readings). This demonstrated a very good correlation between manual analysis of liquefied and washed samples with both staining techniques [intraclass coefficient (ICC) = 0. 93 and 0. 83]. Greater agreement was observed between computerized readings (washed samples) of Diff-Quik® (ICC = 0. 93) than of Papanicolaou-stained slides (ICC = 0. 66). An excellent intra-laboratory correlation was observed for within-computer readings (ICC = 0. 93). There was moderate agreement between inter-laboratory computer readings (two centres, ICC = 0. 72). Although there was lower inter-laboratory agreement for manual and manual versus computer readings, overall results of all manual and computer analyses showed good agreement (ICC = 0. 73). Diff-Quik® staining is reliable for both manual (liquefied) and computer (washed) analysis of strict sperm morphology. Intra- and inter-computer analyses using this method reached satisfactory levels of agreement. There is still high inter-laboratory variability for the manual method. Articl...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the physical and morphological characteristics of the sperm-rich fraction of jackass semen. To this end, 130 ejaculates from five Pêga jackasses were collected using an open model artificial vagina. The sperm-rich fraction was collected using the split-ejaculate method and assessed for the number of mounts/ejaculate, for physical and morphological characteristics of the semen and number of doses produced/ejaculate. It was observed that all characteristics evaluated differed among the five jackasses, except for the head defect rates. The mean values obtained for the jackass sperm-rich fraction collected were: number of mounts/ejaculate - 1. 27; semen volume - 20. 21 mL; motility - 84. 53 %; vigor - 4. 46; motility after dilution - 80. 10 %; sperm concentration/mL - 894. 38 x 106; total sperm/ejaculate - 16. 14 x 109; number of insemination doses/ejaculate (400 x 106 motile sptz) - 33. 39; number of insemination doses/ejaculate (800 x 106 motile sptz) - 16. 69; and percentage of normal sperm - 90. 46 %.
