5|$|Early on September 24, Karl {{continued}} its north-northeast track over the open north-central Atlantic {{and continued to}} gradually weaken. It <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{in contact with the}} baroclinic zone and began to lose tropical characteristics, while still a Category1 hurricane. Karl became extratropical shortly afterward over the northern Atlantic at about 47°N, with its winds dropping below hurricane strength shortly thereafter. The extratropical storm made landfall on the Faroe Islands with hurricane-force wind gusts. As an extratropical low, the cyclone moved northeastward and eastward across the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, eventually reaching Norway before it was absorbed into another extratropical low late on September 28.|$|E
5|$|Further down, Ralf Schumacher took Zonta for {{eleventh}} {{place and}} Diniz passed teammate Salo for 14th position. Barrichello caught de la Rosa by lap twelve and passed {{him to take}} fourth and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> under pressure from Frentzen. Herbert pulled {{over to the side}} of the track with gearbox problems on lap 13. Barrichello passed Trulli for third position at the second corner two laps later. Barrichello became the first driver to make a pit stop by coming in on lap 17. Frentzen made his pit stop one lap later and re-joined in sixth place. By lap 20, Häkkinen had a lead of 1.4 seconds over Coulthard, who in turn was almost 22 seconds ahead of Trulli. de la Rosa was a further 2.1 seconds behind Trulli, and was being caught by Barrichello in fifth who set a new fastest lap, a 1:44.300. Villeneuve overtook Irvine to claim eighth place on lap 22.|$|E

5|$|Ian Richardson {{was booked}} {{within a minute}} {{of the second half}} {{starting}} for bringing down Kiwomya. Notts County <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back into the game; Martindale headed wide, Agana and Richardson both had shots blocked during a goalmouth scramble and Tony Battersby had a shot saved over the crossbar by Jonathan Gould, as County tried to equalise during a 20-minute spell of pressure. Between County's chances, Stallard had the opportunity to double City's lead when he capitalised on a slip from Strodder, but Ward saved his effort. However, City went on to double their advantage on 75 minutes. Ormondroyd, who had replaced the injured Hamilton, flicked on a long pass from Richard Huxford with his first touch. His header went across goal to Stallard who volleyed home. Two minutes after the goal, Martindale fired wide for County after a pass from Agana, and with time running out Finnan's long-range shot was deflected for a corner, but from the resulting set-piece, Richardson shot over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|The fight {{started with}} the three battalions of the Spanish first line {{advancing}} upon the Dutch camp, each one {{trying to be the}} first to laid its bridge over the moat. Haultpenne's Wallons, headed by Sergeant-Major Camille Sacchino, moved up to Deurne, crossing the Schijn river at the small village of Immerseel. Valdés' Germans advanced frontally to Borgerhout across the Borsbeek road, and Figueroa's Spaniards took the Voetweg road to assault the Dutch camp from the south. While the sleeves of musketeers from the Spanish and German units exchanged fire with the Dutch troops covered by the rampart, Sacchino's Walloons drove the defenders of Deurne behind the Groot Schijn stream and took its bridge. De la Noue sent reinforcements there to content the assault, but they arrived too late to prevent the Walloons from laying their bridge over the moat and began to climb the rampart, starting a close combat with the Dutch troops. In the meantime, the Spanish and German troops, supported by two or three artillery pieces, breached the rampart, crossed the moat and also <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> inside Borgerhout, where De la Noue and Norreys' men reorganized and stood on the barricaded streets.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{led away}} at the restart, but his Ferrari {{teammate}} Räikkönen was forced to pull into the pit lane on lap 22 with fire coming from his airbox and subsequently retired, handing second place to Rosberg. Over {{the next couple of}} laps, Vettel was able to pull away from Rosberg on the softer tyre compound. Marcus Ericsson was handed a drive-through penalty for having his team work on his car less than 15 seconds before the restart. By lap 31, the gap between Vettel and Rosberg <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down again, while Hamilton moved ahead of Sainz into fifth as the latter made a pit stop. Two laps later, Verstappen was in as well, but a slow pit stop lost him time. On lap 35, Rosberg took the lead as Vettel made a pit stop, who also lost time due to a mistake during his stop. He emerged back on track in fourth place. Hamilton now started to pull back time on the leaders, while debutant Palmer held off the two Toro Rosso drivers in a struggle for ninth place.|$|E

5|$|While racing for {{position}} on lap 23, Sainz forced Jolyon Palmer {{off the track}} in turn two and was later handed a ten-second time penalty for the incident. Four laps later, Pascal Wehrlein tried to overtake Felipe Nasr for 16th, but was unsuccessful and in turn lost a position to Kvyat. His teammate Ricciardo overtook Kevin Magnussen for eighth on lap 29, but lost the position again and was in turn passed by Romain Grosjean. As Nico Rosberg started to lap backmarkers on lap 31, the gap to second-placed Hamilton <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down, with his advantage dropping from more than eleven seconds to {{a little more than}} seven seconds by lap 36. Meanwhile, Verstappen was forced to retire due to power unit failure on lap 34, while running in sixth place. As Hamilton was told by his pit crew that he suffered from a water pressure problem, his gap to Rosberg started to increase again, staying at 13 seconds by lap 41. Wehrlein made a pit stop for new tyres on the same lap, but problems with his stop forced him stationary for almost a minute, resulting in him moving into last place on the road.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} Chicago Rockets 41–21 at Chicago's Soldier Field {{to extend the}} team's winning streak to four games. The Browns scored a {{touchdown}} {{in the first quarter}} and two more in the second. The team led 27–0 at the half. Chicago, however, <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back in the third quarter after Cleveland coach Paul Brown took out most of his first-string players. Graham, Colella, Lew Mayne and Ed Ulinski sat out most of the game. Chicago quarterback Sam Vacanti threw three touchdown passes in the second half to give the Rockets 21 points, but a score by Cleveland's Boedeker and a fumble return for a touchdown by Spiro Dellerba kept the game out of reach. The Rockets' Bill Kellagher intercepted one of Graham's passes in the first quarter, ending Graham's streak of 91 straight pass attempts without an interception, a professional football record at the time. Chicago had the best passing performance against the Browns of any team the Browns had faced in 1947 as Vacanti threw for 195 yards on 11 completions. Groza kicked through two field goals and five extra points in the game, putting him in third place in scoring in the AAFC behind Motley and New York's Spec Sanders. Motley suffered a head injury during a pileup in the second quarter and was taken to the locker room.|$|E

25|$|The {{establishment}} of the seminary caused a close connection between the Norwegian baptist congregations {{and that of the}} Midwestern United States. New impulses <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from there. A major step took place in 1885, when pastors started to be ordinated. The number of baptist congregations reached eighteen in 1886, although the membership growth was significantly steeper with 1,335 members that year. Ten years later this had increased to 26 congregations and 2,132 members. It reached 35 congregations and 2,900 members in 1902.|$|E

25|$|The year 1922 saw {{a revival}} in Machen's {{literary}} fortunes.

Machen's works had now found a new audience and publishers in America, and a series of requests for republications of books <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in. Vincent Starrett, James Branch Cabell, and Carl Van Vechten were American Machen devotees who helped in this process.|$|E
25|$|As Overwatch {{pornography}} primarily {{makes use}} of official character models with appended genitalia, various takedown notices have been issued to creators of such content.

25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} {{millennium}} AD, eastern Slavic lands <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> under the cultural influence of the Eastern Roman Empire. In 863–69, the Byzantine Greek monks Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius, both from Greek Macedonia, translated parts of the Bible into Old Church Slavonic language for the first time, paving the way for the Christianization of the Slavs and Slavicized peoples of Eastern Europe, the Balkans, Ukraine, and Southern Russia. There is evidence that the first Christian bishop was sent to Novgorod from Constantinople either by Patriarch Photius or Patriarch Ignatios, c. 866–67.|$|E
25|$|By the mid 1900s, after Mexico {{started to}} {{industrialize}} and modernize, {{the consumption of}} pulque and the popularity of pulquerias had greatly declined. This {{is directly related to}} the increase in production and popularity of beer in Mexico. As factories established themselves and migrant workers <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into Mexico, the beer industry greatly expand and beer soon replaced pulque as the alcoholic drink of choice. The popularity of pulquerias declined as they were seen as a thing of the past. By the 1930s, there was a steep reduction in the number of pulquerias in Mexico City, and today there are very few of them left.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Barking Creek, other {{friendly}} fire incidents and {{the paucity of}} material {{on the subject of}} aircraft recognition {{led to the formation of}} an Aircraft Recognition Wing within the Army Anti-Aircraft Command.

The topic also <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the attention of the Inter-Service Recognition Committee that had been formed in 1939 to deal mainly with air-to-ground and air-to-sea signalling to indicate friendly status and by the end of 1940 all three services realised that more work was needed to improve aircraft recognition.|$|E
