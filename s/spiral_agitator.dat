5000|$|Shelton's {{career at}} General Electric began in 1948 as an {{engineer}} in the GE Home Laundry facility in Trenton, New Jersey. In 1952, Shelton transferred to the new General Electric Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky as a Research and Development Engineer when the Trenton Home Laundry division was consolidated there along with GE's other major appliance product lines. His tenure there spanned two decades. While there, his inventions earned 35 patents, primarily related to the drum washing machine, all assigned to GE. His inventions helped create and refine the modern, top-loading, rotating <b>spiral</b> <b>agitator</b> clothes washer. Shelton invented the mechanism to automatically provide the correct water level(s) at a desired water temperature during a washing machine's cycles and an easily removed and cleaned soil trap that strained insoluble dirt and debris as the unit's water was filtered through it during the wash and rinse cycles. GE marketed Shelton's invention as the [...] "Filter-Flo Basket." [...] The unit fit {{on top of the}} washing machine's agitator post and rotated during use. Shelton's inventions also included an anti-siphonage inlet system (US 2638112) to avoid back contamination of a water supply, and a drain overflow arrangement for built-in washing machines that provided a safe means of dealing with excess water during operation.|$|E
40|$|Direct {{reaction}} of elemental silicon with a gaseous mixture of isopropyl chloride (1) and hydrogen chloride {{in the presence}} of copper catalyst using a stirred bed reactor equipped with a <b>spiral</b> band <b>agitator</b> gave isopropyldichlorosilane having a Si-H bond (2 a) as a major product and isopropyltrichlorosilane (2 b) along with chlorosilanes, trichlorosilane and tetrachlorosilane. A process for production of 2 a was maximized using the 1 : 0. 5 mole ratio of 1 to HCl and smaller size of elemental silicon at a reaction temperature of 220 Â°C. When a reaction was carried out by feeding a gaseous mixture of 1 [12. 9 g/h (0. 164 mol/h) ] and HCl [2. 98 g/h (0. 082 mol/h) ] to a contact mixture of elemental silicon (360 g) and copper (40 g) under the optimum condition for 45 h, 2 a among volatile products kept up about 82 mol % until 35 h and then slowly decreased down 68 mol % in 45 h reaction. Finally 2 a was obtained in 38 % isolated yield (based on 1 used) with an 85 % consumption of elemental silicon in a 45 h reaction. In addition to 2 a, 2 b was obtained as minor product along with chlorosilanes, trichlorosilane, and tetrachlorosilane. The decomposition of 1 was suppressed and the production of 2 a improved by adding HCl to 1...|$|R
