5|$|The sicklefin weasel shark {{is found}} off {{southern}} India and Sri Lanka, {{as well as}} from southern China and Taiwan to Java and Borneo. It may also occur in the Philippines and the Red Sea, though specimens from these regions need to be compared taxonomically with those from its confirmed range. It does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> common naturally. This species inhabits continental and insular shelves from inshore waters to at least a depth of , and usually swims close to the sea floor.|$|E
5|$|Water megamasers and kilomasers {{are found}} {{primarily}} associated with active galactic nuclei, while galactic and weaker extragalactic water masers {{are found in}} star forming regions. Despite different environments, the circumstances that produce extragalactic water masers do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different from those that produce galactic water masers. Observations of water megamasers {{have been used to}} make accurate measurements of distances to galaxies in order to provide constraints on the Hubble constant.|$|E

25|$|Gynes {{and other}} female wasps have mate {{recognition}} signals, or pheromones, within their venom, thorax and heads. This causes males to {{be attracted to}} them. The pheromones within the venom <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> strong compared to pheromones from the thorax and head. These pheromones are often spread all over the body during grooming, further increasing the females' attractiveness to males.|$|E

With the help and support of Takaaki [...] Ooishi, Hikari's true talents in rhythmic gymnastics come to light in one of the local tournaments between high schools. This new sign of talent that Uenaga shows on this tournament quickly put her on the map of popularity along with the best rhythmic gymnast of her school, Hazuki Shiina in the national level of competition. Soon both of them begin training hard for the World Cup competition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wreckage}} {{was spread}} over two miles, {{with a cold}} north wind and ice and {{snow on the ground}} combined with a narrow access road made rescue difficult. The fire brigade station officer said it had taken them half an hour to find the wreckage. The National Trust chief ranger with four of his staff were first on the scene reported [...] "Ten bodies were scattered about and we found two men alive. One was outside the aircraft and did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> badly hurt. The other was pulled from inside the smashed fuselage and was only semi-conscious." [...] Two passengers were rescued but one died in hospital later; [...] all the others on board were killed.

He grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, and was inspired to join the United States Air Force (USAF) not by his famous grandfather but by his father, Paul W. Tibbets III, a pharmacist and hospital administrator {{who served in the}} United States Army Reserve, retiring as a colonel. [...] "When I was in 9th grade," [...] he recalled [...] "I became involved in youth service projects. It was a passion of mine to serve. My father said 'You <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> interested in serving – {{what do you want to}} do with your life?' I told him I was interested in serving, and he told me to look into something like the ROTC or service academies." ...|$|E

2500|$|B. cephalotes has {{two main}} ways of {{detecting}} prey: tactile cues and olfactory cues. [...] The olfactory cues, however, do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> specific, as {{the responses to}} the cue do not correspond strongly to preference of prey. The beetle, once in possession of its prey, holds the organism with its forelegs and tears off pieces of the organism to consume. [...] The mandibles are used to tear open the cuticular structures of its meal and expose the soft tissue areas within the organism. Fluid is produced in the mouth during feeding that causes the discoloration of flesh and begins the digestive process. This fluid is composed of a variety of enzymes that begin the digestive process before the prey has entered the beetle’s digestive tract. [...] Many samples of B. cephalotes were found to have sand in their digestive tract in addition to organisms. [...] Sand in the digestive tract may help the beetle grind up the tougher parts of the prey, although it has not yet been determined if the sand is ingested for this purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Sergi López as Captain Vidal, Ofelia's new {{stepfather}} and a Falange officer. Del Toro {{met with}} López in Barcelona, {{a year and}} a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. In Spain, López was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the producers told Del Toro [...] "You should be very careful because you don't know about these things because you're Mexican, but this guy is not going to be able to deliver the performance"; del Toro replied [...] "Well, it's not that I don't know, it's that I don't care". Of his character, López said: [...] "He is the most evil character I've ever played in my career. It is impossible to improve upon it; the character is so solid and so well written. Vidal is deranged, a psychopath who is impossible to defend. Even though his father's personality marked his existence—and is certainly one of the reasons for his mental disorder—that cannot be an excuse. It would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> cynical to use that to justify or explain his cruel and cowardly acts. I think it is great that the film does not consider any justification of fascism." ...|$|E
