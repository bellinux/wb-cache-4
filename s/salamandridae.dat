5|$|Bulgaria is {{a country}} in southeastern Europe {{situated}} entirely in the Balkan peninsula. Bulgaria is inhabited by 20 amphibian species, which makes the amphibians the least diverse class of vertebrates in the country. They include seven species of newts and salamanders from a single family, <b>Salamandridae,</b> as well as 13 frog and toad species from five families—Bombinatoridae, Bufonidae, Hylidae, Pelobatidae and Ranidae. The most recently classified species are the northern crested newt, identified in 2005, and the Macedonian crested newt, identified in 2007.|$|E
500|$|The {{suborder}} Salamandroidea {{contains the}} advanced salamanders. They {{differ from the}} cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw, and by using internal fertilisation. In salamandrids, the male deposits a bundle of sperm, the spermatophore, and the female {{picks it up and}} inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid. The largest family in this group is Plethodontidae, the lungless salamanders, which includes 60% of all salamander species. The family <b>Salamandridae</b> includes the true salamanders and the name [...] "newt" [...] is given to members of its subfamily Pleurodelinae.|$|E
500|$|Alfred {{finally gave}} in to Edward's wishes and paid for {{university}} classes. Cope attended the University of Pennsylvania in the 1861 and/or 1862 academic years, studying comparative anatomy under Joseph Leidy, {{one of the most}} influential anatomists and paleontologists at the time. Cope asked his father to pay for a tutor in both German and French, [...] "not so much for their own sake," [...] wrote Edward, [...] "but as for their value in enabling me to read their books of a literary or scientific character." [...] During this period, he had a job recataloging the herpetological collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences, where he became a member at Leidy's urging. Cope's job lasted two years and he visited the Smithsonian Institution on occasion, where he became acquainted with Spencer Baird, who was an expert in the fields of ornithology and ichthyology. In 1861, he published his first paper on <b>Salamandridae</b> classification; over the next five years he published primarily on reptiles and amphibians. Cope's membership in the Academy of Natural Sciences and American Philosophical Society gave him outlets to publish and announce his work; many of his early paleontological works were published by the Philosophical Society.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, I {{found myself}} blaming Gussie. On {{discovering}} {{that he was}} stressing the newt note in this manner, he ought, of course, to have tuned out, {{even if it had}} meant sitting there saying nothing. No matter how much of a twitter he was in, he should have had sense enough to see that he was throwing a spanner into the works. No girl, when she has been led to expect that a man is about to pour forth his soul in a fervour of passion, likes to find him suddenly shelving the whole topic in favour of an address on aquatic <b>Salamandridae.</b>|$|E
