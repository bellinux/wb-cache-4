If, as we hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{locating}} Project Y at Oak Ridge was considered, {{but in the}} end it {{was decided}} that it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> remote location. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search for a suitable site was narrowed to the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch. In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Project was sent to survey the area, and he recommended a site near Jemez Springs, New Mexico. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were concerned with the possibility of flooding. The party then moved on to the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which, it was hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.|$|E

Onyett called Ryan a key element, and if not included in the sequel, there would be a dramatic loss of personality. He claimed that much of Rapture's personality comes from Ryan, and it would have much less of an impact without him. Editor Ryan Geddes agreed, adding that he felt there was more to Ryan than Rapture. Editor Nate Ahem suggested that the game's sequel, BioShock 2, could potentially put the players in the role of Ryan, to explore the story of trying to create a perfect world and having it crumble beneath their feet.|$|E
500|$|The issue became {{central to}} the demand by many Okinawans and other Japanese {{citizens}} for the significant reduction and eventual elimination of U.S. military forces stationed in Okinawa. [...] In the opinion of many Japanese citizens living in Okinawa, the U.S. used the SOFA to shield U.S. servicemembers who committed crimes against Japanese citizens from the Japanese criminal justice system. [...] The September 4, 1995, widely reported rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen caused the U.S. and Japan to revise the SOFA, stating that in the future, the U.S. would give [...] "sympathetic consideration" [...] to the hand-over of U.S. servicemembers accused of violent crimes such as rape or murder to Japanese authorities before indictment. [...] To many in Okinawa, the incident involving Brown appeared to fall under this new provision in the SOFA. [...] After the initial allegations involving Brown were publicized and before charges had even been filed, Okinawa Governor Keiichi Inamine publicly stated, [...] "This is a heinous crime trampling on female human rights. Moreover, this is a crime committed by a marine corps major, a person who <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> leadership position." ...|$|E

The lyrical content of the song describes the singer waiting at a street corner for her lover to pull up in his jalopy. Patoski found that the storyline seemed to relate to a life that the singer never had, a [...] "tale of barrio teen romance". Guerra summed up the lyrics as a song [...] "about a boyfriend's beat-up old car". American musicologist Ilan Stavans wrote in Encyclopedia Latina that the song is a [...] "vivid poetic portrait of barrio life." [...] Ramiro Burr said that Selena [...] Burr, who [...] said that the band was inspired by cumbia singer Fito Olivares when they recorded [...] "La Carcacha", and called the song a [...] "marvelous" [...] and [...] "danceable cumbia" [...] track. Pérez was asked to perform [...] "Las Cadenas" [...] in a rock style by A.B., who later changed his mind, deciding that the song <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> conjunto (small band) style instead. Pérez was nonetheless overjoyed to record the song, due of the conjunto nature of the track, which brought back memories of his childhood. Pérez added that Selena's vocals would greatly compliment the song, a conjunto song about a jubilant protagonist who regains control of her life after feeling trapped in a relationship. The song made use of the squeezebox, and according to Mario Tarradell of the Dallas Morning News, was [...] "well-crafted, catchy and proficiently played".|$|E

500|$|Reacting to The Killing Joke and Barbara Gordon's later {{character}} development as Oracle in Batman: Gotham Knights, Ray Tate, a reviewer at Comics Bulletin, wrote [...] "here {{is absolutely no}} reason why Barbara Gordon <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wheelchair. Alan Moore and Brian Bolland meant The Killing Joke as an imaginary tale dealing with the iconography of Batman and the Joker... himself is a certifiable genius in biochemistry. There are countless examples of Batman employing that which is only theoretical in his fight against crime. His knowledge of stem cell technology should surpass that of the real world. There is simply no reason for Barbara Gordon to be confined to that wheelchair." [...] Regarding her representation as a character living with a disability, and her effectiveness as a hero compared to her incarnation as Batgirl, Tate asserts [...] "t's ridiculous to think somebody wakes up thinking how lucky {{they are to be}} confined to a wheelchair, and yet the attitude around DC and among the fans is that Oracle is the better character over Batgirl because of her handicap. Rubbish. Batgirl has fought more crime and done more to aid Batman as Batgirl than she has as Oracle. Batgirl has saved Batman's life on numerous occasions. Oracle has not. Barbara in this incarnation is not a bad character, but she is not better because she no longer hunts the night in cape and cowl." [...] In an article for Bitch magazine entitled [...] "The Cold Shoulder: Saving Superheroines from Comic-book Violence", Shannon Cochran noted a long history of inequality regarding the treatment of female heroes. She quotes Gail Simone, who discussed the gender difference regarding the treatment of Batman and Batgirl regarding paralysis: [...] "Both had their backs broken [...] Less than a year later, Batman was fine. Batgirl—now named Oracle—was in a wheelchair and remained so for many years.” ...|$|E

You can picture the movie. I definitely wanted the orchestral elements going on and I definitely wanted the intense factor going on." [...] Clarkson illustrated the album as a concept record telling a single [...] "awesome" [...] story, using different pieces of her character, leading her to name the album Piece by Piece. Citing the aspects of heartbreak and personal struggle as well as peace and empowerment in its lyrical content, she described the record as an album within an uplifting and reflective environment.
