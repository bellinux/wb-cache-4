40|$|Diacetylenic phosphatidylcholines are {{synthetic}} compounds {{analogous to}} natural phospholipids. These molecules can be hydrated to form bilayered aggregates known as liposomes {{in a manner}} similar to natural phosphatidylcholines. A particular feature of these liposomes is their capability of undergoing polymerization when submitted to ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. This process allows the construction of polymerized liposomes possessing interesting physical properties making these vesicles appropriate for <b>slow-release</b> <b>drug</b> delivering systems. In this article we describe the total syntheses of diacetylenic phosphatidylcholines 1, 2 -bis(10 ', 12 '-heptadecadiynoyl) - sn-glycero- 3 -phosphatidylcholine (1 a), 1, 2 -bis(10 ', 12 '-tricosadiynoyl) -sn-glycero- 3 -phosphatidylcholine (1 b) and 1, 2 -bis(4 ', 6 '-tricosadiynoyl) -sn-glycero- 3 -phosphatidylcholine (1 c). Phospholipids 1 a and 1 c, displaying the butadiinyl chromophores closer to the chain terminus, or closer to the polar heads respectively, have not been reported before. Noteworthy was the observation that liofilization of the diacetylenic alcohols and acids intermediates significantly reduced undesired polymerization, allowing to stock these compounds for a short period of time (similar to 24 h) ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of immunotoxicity study of a novel <b>slow-release</b> <b>drug</b> for multiple sclerosis treatment based on recombinant human interferon beta- 1 а. The test article is polyethylene glycol (PEG) -conjugated interferon beta- 1 a. Performed modification allows to improve pharmacokinetic parameters, decrease immunogenicity and elevate tolerance that significantly increases safety of the test article. The study is performed in nonhuman primates – rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). The species, used in this study, is susceptible to human interferon beta- 1 a that has previously been shown in specific activity studies. Dynamics of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets composition, activated lymphocyte count (based on the presence of early activation marker), serum antibodies (IgM, IgG, IgA and IgE) level and ratio were assessed within in vivo experiments. The effect of interferon beta- 1 a on CD 69 expression was examined in mononuclear cells culture. It was shown that the test article causes changes in lymphocyte subsets ratio (decrease of NK-cells relative count with T-lymphocytes relative count elevation) in primates’ peripheral blood. Revealed changes were reversible and dose-independent. It was not shown that the test article have reliable effect on CD 69 expression rate. There was no evidence of test article effect on level and ratio of serum antibodies and polymorphonucleocytes phagocytic rate in the absence of additional antigenic exposure. The results obtained during the experiment indicate the absence of pathological effect of the test article on the nonhuman primates’ immune system. </p...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -A TLX- 5 mouse {{lymphoma}} {{which was}} resistant to 1 -,B-D-arabinofuranosyl cytosine (AraC) {{was used in}} vivo to study {{the possibility of using}} liposomes as drug-delivery vehicles in order to overcome drug resistance. The effects of free drugs (AraC, AraCTP and methotrexate) and the liposomally associated drugs on the survival time of tumour-bearing mice were determined. As a more sensitive measure of cell survival, 125 IUdR was incorporated into the DNA of the ascites TLX- 5 cells before i. p. injection. Cell survival and the cytotoxic effects of the drugs on the tumour cells were determined by using a double-headed gamma counter to measure the retention of the 125 I label. Both AraC and AraCTP, either as the free drugs or liposomally associated, had no effects on the tumour. Due to the lack of response of tumour cells to these drugs, further studies were initiated with free and liposomally associated methotrexate (MTX), a drug to which the cells were known to be sensitive. It was found that the liposomally associated MTX, at a 5 - 10 -fold lower dose than the free drug, was (a) more effective in prolonging the survival of tumour-bearing mice and (b) as effective as the free drug in killing tumour cells (as measured by the 1251 retention). In vivo MTX was more effective in the liposomally associated form, whereas liposomally entrapped AraC and AraCTP were ineffective. It is proposed that in vivo liposomally associated drugs may be acting not by actively localizing in the tumour cells, but by the liposomes providing a <b>slow-release</b> <b>drug</b> depot, improving the pharmacokinetic properties of MTX. A NUMBER OF AUTHORS have previously reported the successful application of liposomally trapped anti-tumour drugs in the treatment of several animal tumours in vivo (Gregoriadis & Neerunjun...|$|E

40|$|After {{months of}} {{successful}} analgesic therapy with oxcarbazepine, a 52 -year old woman with trigeminal neuralgia suddenly experienced episodes of heavy trigeminal attacks {{regularly in the}} evening {{at about the same}} time. Asked about changes in daily life or eating habits, she reported the ingestion of healing earth daily in the morning. After stopping the ingestion of healing earth, analgesic control of trigeminal neuralgia was restored without any changes of the initial pharmacotherapy. In daily practice, interactions which significantly influence the absorption of drugs are often overlooked. The documentation of these interactions in drug interaction databases, in the prescribing information, and in the literature is sparse though clinically relevant. Separating the ingestion of interacting substances by a time interval may not sufficiently avoid the interaction in every case.

40|$|Fullerene (C 60) {{derivatives}} {{have been}} extensively studied {{for a variety}} of medical applications, which include neuroprotective agents, HIV- 1 protease inhibitors, photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy, MRI contrast agents, and radiopharmaceuticals. The first part of this work is dedicated {{to the development of a}} new application of C 60 as a slow-release system for the liposome aerosol delivery of lipophilic chemotherapeutics to lung cancer. TaxolRTM (paclitaxel), one of the most active anticancer drugs in clinical use, has shown significant potential for treatment of lung cancer when delivered by the liposome aerosol method. However, rapid clearance of Taxol from the lungs (within 40 minutes after cessation of aerosol delivery) results in its reduced therapeutic efficacy. A C 60 -Taxol conjugate, a <b>slow-release</b> <b>drug,</b> has been designed and synthesized as a prospective solution to the problem. The conjugate was designed to have no intrinsic activity by modifying 2 '-hydroxyl group of Taxol and to release the active drug via enzymatic hydrolysis of a 2 '-ester bond. The conjugate synthesis involved the synthesis of Taxol- 2 '-succinate and a fullerene aminoderivative and then coupling them with EEDQ. Although very stable as a 10 % DMSO solution at physiological pH, the C 60 -Taxol conjugate demonstrated the ability to release Taxol in the presence of bovine plasma with the hydrolysis half-life of about 80 minutes. The conjugate was also shown to form a stable liposome formulation using dilaurylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), and as a DLPC suspension, demonstrated cytotoxic activity comparable to that of Taxol in human epithelial lung carcinoma A 549 cells. With both clinically-relevant kinetics of hydrolysis and significant cytotoxicity in tissue culture, the conjugate holds promise for enhanced therapeutic efficacy of Taxol in vivo. The second part of this work is dedicated to the design and synthesis of C 60 -based transfection vectors in order to establish a structure-activity relationship (SAR) profile for this class of compounds. Several positively-charged derivatives of C 60 were synthesized via Bingel and Prato chemistry and tested for transfection activity in HEK 293 cells. Out of the three studied derivatives, only Bingel bisadducts permitted effective gene delivery. The maximum of protein expression was observed after 5 days of incubation which is consistent with the results reported for other known C 60 -based transfection vectors. The comparison of the structures of fullerene derivatives now known to permit effective gene delivery reveal similar structural features which can guide the design of potential C 60 -based transfection vectors...|$|E
40|$|Nanodiamonds (NDs) of 2 − 8 nm diameters {{physically}} {{bound with}} the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) were {{embedded within a}} parylene C polymer microfilm through a facile and scalable process. The microfilm architecture consists of DOX-ND conjugates sandwiched between a base and thin variable layer of parylene C which allows for modulation of release. Successive layers of parylene and the DOX-ND conjugates were characterized through atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and drug release assays. Elution rates were tested separately {{over a period of}} 8 days and up to one month in order to illustrate the release characteristics of the microfilms. The microfilms displayed the stable and continuous <b>slow-release</b> of <b>drug</b> for at least one month due to the powerful sequestration abilities of the DOX-ND complex and the release-modulating nature of the thin parylene layer. Since the fabrication process is devoid of any destructive steps, the DOX-ND conjugates are unaffected and unaltered. A DNA fragmentation assay was performed to illustrate this retained activity of DOX under biological conditions. Specifically, in this work we have conferred the ability to tangibly manipulate the NDs in a polymer-packaged microfilm format for directed placement over diseased areas. By harnessing the innate ND benefits in a biostable patch platform, extended targeted and controlled release, possibly relevant toward conditions such as cancer, viral infection, and inflammation, where complementary alternatives to systemic drug release enabled by the microfilm devices, can allow for enhanced treatment efficacy...|$|R

The pure chitosan have poor performance, it should be added to {{a certain amount of}} crosslinking agents, emulsifiers and porogenic agents to improve the performance of it. The advantage of montmorillonite is no pollution and no toxicity, composite material filled in montmorillonite has an excellent mechanical properties. In this article, CS/MMT/ACAP drug-loading microsperes was prepared with the CS, ACAP and MMT as the main raw materials by emulsification-crosslinking method. Orthogonal experiment was designed to optimize the preparation process of the CS/MMT/ACAP drug-loading microspheres. FT-IR, XRD and SEM were applied to characterize the structure and morphology of microspheres. The sustained release effect of CS/MMT/ACAP microsphere was measured by sustained release measurement.

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} compares two methods of {{preparation}} of microparticles of 3, 4 -diaminopyridine (3, 4 -DAP) {{for the treatment}} for multiple sclerosis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome. Poly(epsilon -caprolactone) microparticles were prepared with a solvent-evaporation W/O method. The 3, 4 -DAP was dispersed in dichloromethane, leading to a suspension. The dispersion and the solidification of the dichloromethane droplets in an aqueous phase have led to microparticles of 55. 3 +/- 34. 7 microm. The incorporation of the drug by milligram of powder was very low (1. 91 micrograms/mg) and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) did not show any crystal but marks of dissolved crystals were observed on the polymeric surface. EudragitRS microspheres containing 3, 4 -DAP were prepared by a solvent-evaporation technique using light mineral oil as continuous phase. The drug and the polymer were completely dissolved in an acetone solution, used as discontinuous phase. This formulation {{have led to a}} higher incorporation of the drug (88. 25 micrograms/mg). The particle size was 91. 8 +/- 44. 3 microm. The observation, by SEM, shows many crystals on the surface and inside the microparticles.

40|$|Solid dispersions were {{prepared}} by a conventional solvent evaporation method from the water-insoluble model drug 10 -hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) and monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol) 2000 (mPEG 2000). And then {{one type of}} novel biodegradable nanoparticles, the solid dispersion (HCPT/mPEG-CHO) grafted with carboxymethylchitosan (HCPT/mPEG-g-CMCTS) was synthesized. The increase in HCPT solubility of solid dispersion was up to 21 -fold compared with the original drug. With the increasing {{of the amount of}} mPEG-CHO, solubility of HCPT was from 7. 71 [*]μg/mL to 25. 82 [*]μg/mL. Colloid systems based on solid dispersion were stable in aqueous medium at 5 °C. After 5 months storage at 25 °C, the solid dispersions do not change at all. HCPT/mPEG-g-CMCTS was synthesized by grafting reaction of carboxymethylchitosan with mPEG-CHO to form Schiff base which is sensitive to acid environment. The release rate of HCPT from this conjugate in pH 5. 4 was much higher than that in the environment of pH 7. 4 and p H 4. 5. The cumulative release percentages are 45 %, 25 %, and 15 %, respectively. The cumulative release percentage of HCPT in conjugate was only 15 % within 85 [*]h while the original drug was up to 70 % in pH 7. 4, showing a significant <b>slow-release</b> property.

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), is {{a pivotal}} {{mediator}} in cardiovascular physiology. This gasotransmitter evokes vasorelaxing effects through different mechanisms of action, {{such as the}} inhibition of phosphodiesterases and activation of vascular KATP and Kv 7 potassium channels. Indeed, impaired production of H 2 S contributes to the pathogenesis of important cardiovascular disorders [1]. Therefore, exogenous compounds, acting as H 2 S-releasing agents, are viewed as promising therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases. This work aimed at evaluating the H 2 S-releasing properties of the p-Carboxyphenyl-Isothiocyanate (PhNCS-COOH) derivative and its vascular effects. H 2 S release was first determined by the amperometric approach, and unequivocally confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Unlike NaHS, a fast H 2 S-donor widely used in the laboratory but unsuitable for clinical use, PhNCS-COOH exhibited a slow H 2 S-releasing profile, similar to the <b>slow-releasing</b> reference <b>drugs</b> diallyldisulfide (DADS) and GYY 4137. H 2 S release from PhNCS-COOH occurred only {{in the presence of}} an excess of L-Cysteine: this thiol-dependency has been viewed as a particularly advantageous property, because it allows this compound to release H 2 S only in a biological environment. The vascular activity of PhNCS-COOH was tested in rat aorta and coronary arteries. Like NaHS, PhNCS-COOH displayed concentration-dependent vasorelaxing effects on endothelium-denuded rat aortic rings. These effects were significantly antagonized by the Kv 7 blocker XE 991. PhNCS-COOH also inhibited the vasoconstricting effect of noradrenaline (NA), with greater potency than NaHS. In addition, the isothiocyanate derivative increased basal coronary flow similarly to NaHS. Furthermore PhNCS-COOH was more effective than NaHS in counteracting the coronary vasoconstriction induced by angiotensin II. Since H 2 S is known to hyperpolarize vascular smooth muscle by activating KATP and Kv 7 channels [1, 2], we evaluated its effects on the membrane potential of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) using a membrane potential sensitive fluorescent dye. Like the reference Kv 7 activator Retigabine, PhNCS-COOH evoked a marked hyperpolarization, largely due to the activation of Kv 7 channels [3]. In conclusion, PhNCS-COOH {{can be viewed as a}} new suitable slow H 2 S-releasing drug, endowed with vasorelaxing effects, typical of the endogenous gasotransmitter. PhNCS-COOH might be employed as a novel chemical tool in basic studies and in the development of original drugs in cardiovascular diseases...|$|R
