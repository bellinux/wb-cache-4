In particular, we compare two different definitions proposed in the literature for the entropy using a spatial averaging prescription. For one definition, the entropy of the large-scale structure for a given comoving volume always grows with time, both for a CDM and a ΛCDM model. In particular, while it diverges for a CDM model, it saturates to a constant value {{in the presence of}} a cosmological constant. The use of a light-cone averaging prescription in the context of the evaluation of the entropy is also discussed. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|In {{nonlinear}} electrodynamics, {{by implementing}} the causality principle as {{the requirement that}} the group velocity of elementary excitations over a background field should not exceed {{the speed of light}} in the vacuum and the unitarity principle as the requirement that the residue of the propagator should be nonnegative, we establish the positive convexity of the effective Lagrangian on the class of constant fields, also the positivity of all characteristic dielectric and magnetic permittivity constants that are derivatives of the effective Lagrangian with respect to the field invariants. Violation of the general principles by the one-loop approximation in QED at exponentially large magnetic field is analyzed resulting in complex energy ghosts that signal the instability of the magnetized vacuum. Superluminal excitations (tachyons) appear, too, but for the magnetic field exceeding its instability threshold. Also other popular Lagrangians are tested to establish that the ones leading to spontaneous vacuum magnetization possess wrong convexity.

We follow common procedures in statistical mechanics to revise the issue without the disputed approximation. Our conclusions contradict the current wisdom and reveal and unexpected scenario for {{the origin of}} primordial cosmological structures. We show that standard physics operating in the cosmic plasma during the radiation dominated {{expansion of the universe}} produce at the time of decoupling scale invariant density anisotropies over cosmologically large comoving volumes. Scale invariance is shown to be a direct consequence of the causality constrains imposed by the short FRW comoving horizon at decoupling, which strongly suppress the power spectrum of density fluctuations with cosmologically large comoving wavelength. The global amplitude of these cosmological density anisotropies is fixed by the power spectrum in comoving modes whose wavelength is shorter than the causal horizon at the time and can be comparable to the amplitude of the primordial cosmological inhomogeneities imprinted in the cosmic microwave background radiation.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of even minuscule baryonic R-parity violation, the stop can be the lightest superpartner and evade LHC searches because it decays into two jets. In order to cover this interesting possibility, we here consider new searches for RPV stops produced in gluino cascades. While typical searches for gluinos decaying to stops rely on same-sign dileptons, the RPV cascades usually have fewer hard leptons, less excess missing energy, and more jets than R-parity conserving cascades. If the gluino is a Dirac fermion, same-sign dilepton signals are also often highly depleted. We therefore explore search strategies that use single-lepton channels, and combat backgrounds using HT, jet counting, and more detailed multijet kinematics or jet substructure. We demonstrate that the stop mass peaks can be fully reconstructed over {{a broad range of}} spectra, even given the very high jet multiplicities. This would not only serve as a "double-discovery" opportunity, but would also be a spectacular confirmation that the elusive top-partner has been hiding in multijets. Comment: 26 pages, 6 figures.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{scenario}} {{to explain the}} observed cosmological asymmetry between matter and antimatter, based on nonperturbative QCD physics. This scenario relies on a mechanism of separation of quarks and antiquarks in two coexisting phases {{at the end of}} the cosmological QCD phase transition: ordinary hadrons (and antihadrons), along with massive lumps (and antilumps) of novel color superconducting phase. The latter would serve as the cosmological cold dark matter. In certain conditions the separation of charge is C and CP asymmetric and can leave a net excess of hadrons over antihadrons in the conventional phase, even if the visible universe is globally baryon symmetric B = 0. In this case an equal, but negative, overall baryon charge must be hidden in the lumps of novel phase. Due to the small volume occupied by these dense lumps/antilumps of color superconducting phase and the specific features of their interaction with "normal" matter in hadronic phase, this scenario does not contradict the current phenomenological constrains on presence of antimatter in the visible universe. Moreover, in this scenario the observed cosmological ratio Ω_DM∼Ω_B within an order of magnitude finds a natural explanation, as both contributions to Ω originated from the same physics during the QCD phase transition. The baryon to entropy ratio n_B/n_γ∼ 10 ^- 10 would also be a natural outcome, fixed by the temperature T_f T_QCD at which the separation of phases is completed.

40|$|Host {{specificity}} is {{a fundamental}} property implicit in obligate insect-plant associations. Rigid life history constraints exhibited by parasitoid fig wasps are believed to select for specialization directed at fig trees and this is supported by evidence of phenotypic adaptation to figs and partial co-speciation with the fig wasps they attack. Conversely, the ability to colonize such novel communities occurs under relaxed specificity, a behavior typified by more generalist groups such as parasitoids. The specificity directed towards Ficus species by Sycoryctinae parasitoid fig wasps is important {{in order to understand}} how this form of specialization influences their diversification and interactions with other fig wasp guilds. We use genetic distance analyses and reconstruct ancestral patterns of Ficus trait association with two genera of Sycoryctinae parasitoid fig wasps to identify evolutionary conservatism in Ficus species utilization. Ancestral state reconstructions of (i) affiliate Ficus <b>subsection</b> and (<b>ii)</b> syconia diameters of natal Ficus species indicate contrasting Ficus species ranges between Arachonia and Sycoryctes parasitoid genera. This work demonstrates that parasitoid speciation is not tightly constrained to Ficus speciation and rather a function of Ficus range limitations. Ficus evolution, ecology, and functional compatibility between parasitoid and Ficus traits appear to constrain parasitoid Ficus utilization. These results suggest that contrasting ecological settings and potential number of hosts available impose different ramifications for the evolution of parasitoid host specificity and so to the species interactions within the communities to which they belong. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} {{of the program is}} to develop design concepts, {{incorporating}} advanced technologies in areas such as oxygen production, feed systems, gas cleanup, component separations and gas turbines, for integrated and economically viable coal and biomass fed gasification facilities equipped with carbon capture and storage for the following scenarios: (i) coproduction of power along with hydrogen, (ii) coproduction of power along with fuels, (iii) coproduction of power along with petrochemicals, and (iv) coproduction of power along with agricultural chemicals. To achieve this goal, specifically the following objectives are met in this proposed project: (i) identify advanced technology options and innovative preliminary design concepts that synergistically integrate plant <b>subsections,</b> (<b>ii)</b> develop steady state system simulations to predict plant efficiency and environmental signature, (iii) develop plant cost estimates by capacity factoring major subsystems or by major equipment items where required, and then capital, operating and maintenance cost estimates, and (iv) perform techno- economic analyses for the above described coproduction facilities. Thermal efficiencies for the electricity only cases with 90 % carbon capture are 38. 26 % and 36. 76 % (HHV basis) with the bituminous and the lignite feedstocks respectively. For the coproduction cases (where 50 % of the energy exported {{is in the form of}} electricity), the electrical efficiency, as expected, is highest for the hydrogen coproduction cases while lowest for the higher alcohols (ethanol) coproduction cases. The electrical efficiencies for Fischer-Tropsch coproduction cases are slightly higher than those for the methanol coproduction cases but it should be noted that the methanol (as well as the higher alcohol) coproduction cases produce the finished coproduct while the Fischer-Tropsch coproduction cases produce a coproduct that requires further processing in a refinery. The cross comparison of the thermal performance between the various coproduct cases is further complicated by the fact that the carbon footprint is not the same when carbon leaving with the coproduct are accounted for. The economic analysis and demand for a particular coproduct in the market place is a more meaningful comparison of the various coproduction scenarios. The first year cost of electricity calculated for the bituminous coal is $ 102. 9 /MWh while that for the lignite is $ 108. 1 /MWh. The calculated cost of hydrogen ranged from $ 1. 42 /kg to $ 2. 77 /kg depending on the feedstock, which is lower than the DOE announced hydrogen cost goal of $ 3. 00 /kg in July 14, 2005. Methanol cost ranged from $ 345 /MT to $ 617 /MT, while the market price is around $ 450 /MT. For Fischer-Tropsch liquids, the calculated cost ranged from $ 65 /bbl to $ 112 /bbl, which is comparable to the current market price of crude oil at around $ 100 /bbl. It should be noted, however, that F-T liquids contain no sulfur and nitrogen compounds. The calculated cost of alcohol ranged from $ 4. 37 /gal to $ 5. 43 /gal, while it ranged from $ 2. 20 /gal to $ 3. 70 /gal in a DOE funded study conducted by Louisiana State University. The Louisiana State University study consisted of a significantly larger plant than our study and benefited from economies of scale. When the plant size in our study is scaled up to similar size as in the Louisiana State University study, cost of alcohol is then reduced to a range of $ 3. 24 /gal to $ 4. 28 /gal, which is comparable. Urea cost ranged from $ 307 /MT to $ 428 /MT, while the market price is around $ 480 /MT...|$|R
40|$|Baryon number {{violation}} {{is discussed}} in gauge unified orbifold models of type II string theory with intersecting Dirichlet branes. We consider setups of D 6 -branes which extend along the flat Minkowski space-time directions and wrap around 3 -cycles of the internal 6 -d manifold. The discussion is motivated by the enhancement effect of low energy amplitudes anticipated for M-theory and type II string theory models with matter modes localized at points of the internal manifold. The conformal field theory formalism is {{used to evaluate the}} open string amplitudes at tree level. We study the single baryon number violating processes of dimension 6 and 5, involving four quarks and leptons and in supersymmetry models, two pairs of matter fermions and superpartner sfermions. The higher order processes associated with the baryon number violating operators of dimension 7 and 9 are also examined, but in a qualitative way. We discuss the low energy representation of string theory amplitudes in terms of infinite series of poles associated to exchange of string Regge resonance and compactification modes. The comparison of string amplitudes with the equivalent field theory amplitudes is first studied in the large compactification radius limit. Proceeding next to the finite compactification radius case, we present a numerical study of the ratio of string to field theory amplitudes based on semi-realistic gauge unified non-supersymmetric and supersymmetric models employing the Z 3 and Z 2 xZ 2 orbifolds. We find a moderate enhancement of string amplitudes which becomes manifest in the regime where the gauge symmetry breaking mass parameter exceeds the compactification mass parameter, corresponding to a gauge unification in a seven dimensional space-time.

40|$|The {{transient}} {{that results}} from a postulated feedwater line break is sensitive to the break discharge rate; consequently, a range of break sizes should be evalu-ated {{both inside and outside}} containment to determine the acceptability of the response. Depending upon the size and location of the break and the plant operating conditions {{at the time of the}} break, the break could cause either a reactor coolant system cooldown (by excessive energy discharge through the break) or a reactor coolant system heatup (by reducing feedwater flow to the affected steam generator). Therefore, analyses of various postulated break sizes and locations are needed to identify the particular situation that is most limiting with respect to system effects. If a feedwater line rupture causes the water in the steam generator to be discharged through the break, the water will not be available for decay heat removal after reactor scram. The break location and size may be such to prevent addition of any feedwater to the affected steam generator. An auxiliary feed-water system is therefore provided to assure that feedwater is available to provide decay heat removal. The review includes evaluation of the applicant's postulated initial core and reactor conditions pertinent to the feedwater line break, the methods of thermal and hydraulic analysis, the postulated sequence of events including analyses to determine the time of reactor trip and time delays prior and subsequent to initi-ation of reactor protection system actions, the assumed response of the reactor coolant and auxiliary systems, the functional and operational characteristics of the reactor protection system in terms of its effects on the sequence of events, and all operator actions required to secure and maintain the reactor in a safe shutdown condition.

40|$|The largest {{deposit of}} {{excellently}} preserved Mio-Pliocene vertebrate faunas in South Africa {{is located at}} the well known Langebaanweg (LBW) site along South Africa’s west coast in the southwestern Cape. This research deals with a core (BH 2) drilled at Langebaanweg ‘E’ Quarry, which captures Miocene fluvial deposits that unconformably underlie the Mio-Pliocene deposits. The aim of the study is to constrain fluctuations in climate and ecosystems in the region during the Miocene, using a combination of sedimentology, palynology, and biogeochemistry. The latter is a novel application and includes bulk C and N isotope measurements as well as branched GDGT (glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether) membrane lipid compositions of the organic fraction of the core. The mean annual temperature (MAT) at time of deposition and ambient pH values were calculated using the Methylation index of Branched Tetraethers (MBT) and Cyclization ratio of Branched Tetraethers (CBT) proxies. The core samples analysed spanned a depth interval of 17 – 33 m and had MATs ranging between 12. 4 °C and 26. 6 °C and pH range from 4. 4 to 6. 4. Furthermore, samples showed a low variance and light d 13 C distribution (from – 25. 52 ‰ to – 24. 27 ‰) and overall low C/N ratios. Palynological investigation supplemented earlier similar studies, reaffirming alternating sequences of tropical and subtropical elements including wetland taxa and complementing calculated MAT results. Pollen results from the lowermost subsection indicated a species-rich tropical/subtropical Podocarpus dominated forest with MATs at 16. 2 °C. The pollen-bearing middle subsection shows initially subhumid conditions, with MATs between 15. 4 and 26. 6 °C, similar {{to the bottom of the}} section with high Podocarpaceae percentages, low Restionaceae and aquatics. Above this, local taxa, e. g. Restionaceae and algae increase, and a marine influence is indicated by abundant dinoflagellates.

40|$|Direct {{production}} of electroweakly charged states may not produce the high energy jets or the significant missing energy required in many new physics searches at the LHC. However, because these states produce leptons, {{they are still}} potentially detectable over the sizeable Standard Model backgrounds. We show that current LHC Higgs searches, particularly in the WW* and ZZ* channels, are sensitive to new electroweak states, such as supersymmetric charginos or neutralinos. Indeed, the 1. 7 fb^{- 1 } Higgs searches can provide the strongest limits in certain regions of parameter space, extending the LEP bound up to ~ 200 GeV in some cases. Additionally, electroweakino production can form an interesting physics background for Higgs searches, especially at low luminosity and statistics.

40|$|In {{this book}} {{a group of}} independed-minded {{academics}} has orchestrated a multi-authored text that represents an update of knowledge concerning how motivation influences Cardiovascular (CV) response. Discussing diverse motivational approaches that are representative of works carried out in several areas of psychology, health implications of the linkages between motivational variables and CV response have been investigated. The volume {{is divided into two}} major parts: Part I includes chapters that concern mechanisms of motivational influence on CV response, while in the Part II motivational paths to carry out with the aim of investigate CV response in different life circumstances have been considered. In more detail, 4 subsections organize Part I through 10 chapters, and 3 <b>subsections</b> constitute Part <b>II</b> by means of 9 chapters, each of those preceded by a summary of the key points. The opening chapters discuss the importance of modern neuroimaging techniques in allowing occasions to investigate how the interplay between CV status, cognitive-emotional functioning, and environmental demands are realized within the central and peripheral nervous systems. The relationship between emotional arousal and CV response has been noteworthy argued and enriched by results from recent research findings in various disciplines (Pietrabissa et al., 2012; Compare et al., 2013 a). These studies demonstrate stress, motivational intensity, individual personality, self-regulation and mood states being in charge of health damaging CV adjustments, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and heart contraction force (Compare et al., 2011 a, 2012, 2013 b). Part II mainly contains evidences that CV activity is an indicator or even cause for CV diseases development, also including explanations about the role covered by gender, psychological processes, and social interactions in influencing health outcomes via relevant biological pathway. In addition, a set of considerations that may guide future research on this subject are discussed. Due to the various contributions from different authors of different countries, both style of writing and chapters arrangement widely varies. Some issues are effectively revisited on several occasions in the volume, constituting minor imperfections in an otherwise excellent, comprehensive, and up-to-date overview of mechanisms and applications related to CV disease. In fact, this book, edited by two psychologists and written by an International group of specialists in different fields of medicine, successfully covers the subject. Because of diseases generally display a multifactorial aetiology and symptoms require to be assumed as manifestations of a complex interplay of several factors, the bio-psycho-social approach of illness theorized by Engel (1977) remains in the background. Health and illness are not seen as opposite concepts or distinct entities but extremes of a continuum on which individuals constantly flux depending on the quality of their daily-life experiences, influenced by biological (e. g., genetics, age), psychological (e. g., attitude, stress) (Compare et al., 2011 b, 2013 c), and social (e. g., interpersonal relationships, socio-economic status) factors (Castelnuovo, 2010; Compare et al., 2013 c). Due to this complexity, as well as stated the crucial role of both personal dispositions and intentions in modifying personal attitudes and behaviors, the relevance of setting realistic goal, implementing patient-centered treatments and developing motivational enhancement techniques, is highlighted. Overall, this book represents a well-collated collection of research outcomes, successfully demonstrating the importance of both psychological factors and motivation in the treatment of patients suffering from CV diseases (Manzoni et al., 2011 a). In fact, as extensively discussed through the pages of this volume, the individual's level of initial motivation, reflecting the maximum energy spent by a person for goals attainment, represent one the main predictor of success in preventing and managing CV risk factors (Manzoni et al., 2011 b) also by modern telecare systems (Villani et al., 2007). However, the text is so densely written than chapters seem to be resources for references rather than flowing text. Despite recent technological changes have made information readily available on the Internet, because of potentially appealing scholars and practitioners {{from a wide range of}} areas, together with its acceptable price, this book still constitute a significant source of outcomes and data...|$|R

The dominion, use and exploitation {{of land and}} everything linked to it, {{especially with regard to}} access to water resources 1, have always been one of the main ambitions of the human race, with important effects on its history. This is how I have come to understand it and, personally, how it has led me to respectfully acknowledge its obvious importance, a respect that I emphasise when it comes to those who seek their subsistence – rarely easy – by contributing with their energy and care. Apart from this, however, to date it has not been the subject of my research. Yet, I must note that, from time to time, becoming more familiar with certain realities made me somewhat restless. This is the case of the oligopolies created around the world that deal with seeds 2 and fertilisers and herbicides, and the consequences deriving therefrom 3. And the same goes for the extremely high concentration of companies {{at the heart of the}} food supply chains 4. Furthermore, there is also the impact of the agricultural policies of the developed countries on those of the Third World 5 or the so-called aid or cooperation for development 6, etc. The restlessness I referred to earlier has now given way to a marked concern that leads me to approach the growing problems in which, under the label of land grabbing, are producing serious breaches of Human Rights, these having been the main aim of my studies for many years now 7. I must underscore the fact that these pages are a response to the need that has grown within me to make contact with those core issues, which I understand to be highly complex 8 and that require a deep examination and interdisciplinary study, and if possible that offer something to those who, like myself, find themselves in the initial phases of delving into the matter. Thus, following these brief preliminary observations (Subsection I), I will further develop the present work by outlining some general aspects (<b>Subsection</b> <b>II),</b> followed by the presentation of the Mubende-Neumann case (Subsection III) of an analysis of the so-called extraterritorial obligations (Subsection IV) and of its conclusion through some general considerations (Subsection V). With all the risks involved in choosing from such a wide range of cases in an active situation, I have opted for the case in reference due to the fact that, as I understand it, it is significant and in line with the aim of this work that I will now carry out in the order described here...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, victims’ {{rights have}} gained a central {{place in the}} {{academic}} and policy reflections both in North America and Europe. After decades of indifference, in which the victim was relegated to the marginal role of being a reporter of the crime and a witness in court, the light has been turned towards this figure, leading {{to the discovery of}} the importance of its contribution to the trial dialectical confrontation, a role traditionally reserved for the accused and the prosecutor. Starting from the 1970 s onwards, the «victims’ movement», composed of radical feminists, groups of ex-victims, lawyers, psychologists and psychiatrists, criminal justice agencies, academics, all moved by different ideologies and aims, struggled to put in the political and legislative agenda the victims’ need for consideration and respect. One of the most controversial issues on this subject, both from an international and domestic perspective, concerns the victim’s rights of participation in the criminal proceedings. In fact, the participation of the victim of a crime in the respective trial and, more specifically, the recognition of victim’s powers to intervene, in different ways, in the process, affects the utmost right of the accused to a fair trial. My research project aims at analyzing three different criminal models, looking at their evolution through the case-law of the different courts. Through a structural approach to the legal institutes, {{it will be possible to}} infer «le grands courants législatifs actuels» on the victim’s role and participation. The victims’ right to participate in court proceedings by expressing views and concerns through their own legal representative has been one of the major innovations of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Article 68 of the Rome Statute (the treaty that created the ICC) clearly declares that the Court shall permit the views and concerns of the victim to be presented and considered at stages of the proceedings determined to be appropriate by the Court. Since the first decision on the topic, issued by the Court in 2006, ICC judges have endorsed a broad interpretation of Article 68 and of the related articles of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence (Chapter <b>II,</b> <b>Subsection</b> 2), but failed to reach an agreement on the boundaries of that participation. Therefore, this essential right of the victim is influenced by the Pre-Trail and Trial Chambers different interpretations. A study of these decisions could bring to a wider knowledge of the topic, highlight potential improvements and explore failings in delivering meaningful participation to victims. The US system has been modified in 2004, with the approval of the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA) and the subsequent introduction of Section 3771 to title 18 of the US Code. The amendment has enumerated a list of rights afforded to the victims harmed as a result of «the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia», and between them «the right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court, involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding». The emergent expanded role of the victim, under this most recent piece of legislation, has been drawn by the case-law, with particular progress in increased victim participation at sentencing. The study of the case-law could contribute to highlight differences and similarities with regard to the victim status in the European legislation. The most recent European directive (2012 / 29 /UE) on the subject was approved in October 2012. The first part of the directive defines the general status of the victims, recognizing them information from the first contact with a competent authority and about their case, their right to interpretation and translation and the right to understand and be understood; chapter 3, more specifically, states the right to be heard during criminal proceedings, to provide evidence and to receive a review of a decision not to prosecute. In 1989 the Italian code of criminal procedure has adopted the accusatorial system, keeping several corrective inquisitorial institutions, such as the participation in the trial of the parte civile (i. e. the damaged of the crime, not necessary coincident with the victim) to obtain punitive damages from the convicted. The parte civile can take part in the trial, but has no rights during the criminal investigations; meanwhile the victim as well, has very little chances to influence the investigation, helping the prosecutor to search evidences of the crime committed and of the supposed author. In the context of European law, modified by the Treaty of Lisbon, regulations and directive have an increasingly large impact on the national criminal systems. The analysis of the Italian decisions, implementing the directive, together with the study of US Courts case-law and ICC jurisprudence, could lead to a deeper comprehension of these three different criminal procedure systems, offering the basis to infer general trends and future perspective of the status of the victim participation in the criminal proceedings, at the international and national level...|$|R
