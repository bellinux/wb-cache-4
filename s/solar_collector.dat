Finally, the paper identifies that heat-pipe-type evacuated tubes <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> and the <b>solar</b> heat-collecting systems that are combined with buildings will be the important development direction for the utilization of solar water heating systems in the future...|$|R

The share of <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> and heat pump productions is negligible and not included in Fig.  6. <b>Solar</b> <b>collectors,</b> as well as heat pump usage, are not processes that can evolve without the application of additional financial aid [30].|$|R

25|$|The <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> area: This can {{be located}} in the top part of the chimney or can include the entire shaft. The orientation, type of glazing, {{insulation}} and thermal properties of this element are crucial for harnessing, retaining and utilizing solar gains.|$|E
25|$|In annualized geo solar systems, the <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> {{is often}} {{separate}} from (and hotter or colder than) the living space. The building {{may actually be}} constructed from insulation, for example, straw-bale construction. Some buildings have been aerodynamically designed so that convection via ducts and interior spaces eliminates any need for electric fans.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{transport}} {{refers to}} the activity in which heat from a <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> is transported to the heat storage vault. Heat insulation is vital in both heat transport tubing {{as well as the}} storage vault. It prevents heat loss, which in turn relates to energy loss, or decrease in the efficiency of the system.|$|E

25|$|The {{atmospheric}} vortex proposal {{replaces the}} physical chimney by a controlled or 'anchored' cyclonic updraft vortex. Depending on the column gradient of temperature and pressure, or buoyancy, {{and stability of}} the vortex, very high-altitude updraft may be achievable. As an alternative to a <b>solar</b> <b>collector,</b> industrial and urban waste-heat {{could be used to}} initiate and sustain the updraft in the vortex.|$|E
25|$|Another {{trick is}} to cool the {{building}}'s thermal mass at night, and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps {{to be able to}} route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky facing radiators can cool below freezing.|$|E
25|$|Glazed solar {{collectors}} are designed primarily for space heating. They recirculate building air through a solar air panel {{where the air}} is heated and then directed back into the building. These solar space heating systems require at least two penetrations into the building and only perform when {{the air in the}} <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> is warmer than the building room temperature. Most glazed collectors are used in the residential sector.|$|E

25|$|A recent {{innovation}} {{has been}} the use of transpired collectors {{in place of the}} traditional glazing covers. Transpired collectors have efficiencies in the 60% to 80% range or three times the 25% efficiency measured with the greenhouse collectors. The large <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> field can now be reduced to half or less making solar updraft towers much more cost effective. A patent has been granted on a solar tower system using transpired collectors.|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaic thermal hybrid <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> (PVT) are {{systems that}} convert solar {{radiation}} into thermal and electrical energy. These systems combine a solar PV cell, which converts sunlight into electricity, with a solar thermal collector, which captures the remaining energy and removes waste {{heat from the}} PV module. The capture of both electricity and heat allow these devices to have higher exergy and thus be more overall energy efficient than solar PV or solar thermal alone.|$|E

500|$|The TARDIS {{is caught}} in the first waves of a [...] "solar tsunami" [...] and materialises on Earth in the 22nd century. The Doctor, Amy and Rory find {{themselves}} on a remote island, where a factory housed in a former castle monastery pumps a valuable, highly corrosive acid to the mainland. The skeleton crew of the factory uses a self-replicating fluid called the Flesh from which they create doppelgängers of themselves, colloquially called [...] "Gangers". The crew control the Gangers from special harnesses, operating in the hazardous environment of the factory via the disposable bodies. The Doctor, initially posing as a weatherman, fears {{the worst part of}} the solar tsunami will strike the solar-powered factory soon, threatening those still remaining, and offers to take the crew in his TARDIS. The foreman, Miranda Cleaves (Raquel Cassidy), refuses to shut down the factory until she receives orders from the mainland. As the solar storm begins, the Doctor races to disconnect the <b>solar</b> <b>collector,</b> but an electrical strike hits the castle, throwing the Doctor off the tower and knocking everyone inside unconscious.|$|E
2500|$|By a Promethean recipe of {{the third}} kind, Georgescu understands a <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> {{returning}} a net energy output sufficiently large to supply all the energy input needed to manufacture an additional <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> of the same kind, thereby constituting a full serial reproduction with regard to solar energy only. The fact that solar collectors of various kinds had been in operation on a substantial scale {{for more than a}} century without providing a breakthrough in energy efficiency brought Georgescu to the conclusion that no Promethean recipe was yet around in the world in his day. Only feasible recipes for solar collectors were available, functioning like what he labelled 'parasites' with regard to the terrestrial inputs of energy for their manufacture and operation — and like any other parasite, these recipes cannot survive their host (the 'host' being the sources of the terrestrial inputs). Georgescu believed that for a worldwide solar-powered economy to be truly energy self-supporting, a Promethean kind of <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> had yet to be invented. [...] Later, some scholars have argued that the efficiency of solar collectors has increased considerably since Georgescu made these assessments.|$|E
