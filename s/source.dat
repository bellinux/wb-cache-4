40|$|Abstract. New long-slit spectra are {{presented}} {{for a group}} of Compact-Steep-Spectrum (CSS) <b>sources</b> (i. e. powerful radio <b>sources</b> with sub-galactic size and steep spectral index at high radio frequencies) selected from the southern (δ < 10 ◦) 2 -Jy sample of radio <b>sources</b> with redshift limit of z = 0. 7. Their spectra are strong in emission lines (e. g. [O III]λ 5007 and [O II]λ 3727), as expected for such powerful radio <b>sources.</b> The line luminosities and ratios obtained for these compact <b>sources</b> are compared with those for the other <b>sources</b> of the southern 2 -Jy sample. We find that the optical spectra for the CSS <b>sources</b> show characteristics very similar to the extended <b>sources</b> of similar radio power and redshift. In particular, we find that the CSS <b>sources</b> follow the correlation between the radio power and [O III]λ 5007 and [O II]λ 3727 luminosities found for the extended <b>sources,</b> although there is tentative evidence that they have lower [O III]λ 5007 luminosities. Also, the optical continuum spectral energy distribution (SED) and polarization properties of the CSS <b>sources</b> show the same variety of characteristics observed among the extended <b>sources.</b> The first-order similarity that we find between the spectra of CSS <b>sources</b> and the extended <b>sources</b> of similar radio power is consistent with the idea that the CSS <b>sources</b> are young radio <b>sources</b> in which the radio jets have yet to emerge from the central regions of the host galaxies...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} <b>sourcing</b> {{decision}} of a buyer choosing between two supplier types: responsible suppliers are costly but adhere to strict {{social and environmental}} responsibility standards, while risky suppliers are less expensive but may experience responsibility violations. A segment of the consumer population, called socially conscious, {{is willing to pay}} a higher price for a product <b>sourced</b> from a responsible supplier, and will not buy from the firm {{in the event of a}} responsibility violation from a risky supplier. We identify four possible <b>sourcing</b> strategies that a buyer might employ: low cost <b>sourcing</b> (<b>sourcing</b> from the risky supplier), dual <b>sourcing,</b> responsible niche <b>sourcing</b> (<b>sourcing</b> from a responsible supplier and selling only to socially conscious consumers), and responsible mass market <b>sourcing</b> (<b>sourcing</b> responsibly and selling to all consumers). We determine when each strategy is optimal, and show that efforts to improve supply chain responsibility that focus on consumers (by increasing their willingness-to-pay for responsibility or increasing the number of consumers that are socially conscious) may lead to unintended consequences such as an increase in risky <b>sourcing.</b> Efforts that focus on enforcement and penalizing the buyer, however, never backfire and always lead to more responsible <b>sourcing</b> and less risky <b>sourcing...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper studies a buyer’s {{inventory}} control problem under a long-term horizon. The buyer has one major supplier that {{is prone to}} disruption risks and one backup supplier with higher wholesale price. Two kinds of <b>sourcing</b> methods are available for the buyer: single <b>sourcing</b> with/without contingent supply and dual <b>sourcing.</b> In contingent <b>sourcing,</b> the backup supplier is capacitated and/or has yield uncertainty, whereas in dual <b>sourcing</b> the backup supplier has an incentive to offer output flexibility during disrupted periods. The buyer’s expected cost functions and the optimal base-stock levels using each <b>sourcing</b> method under long-term horizon are obtained, respectively. The effects of three risk parameters, disruption probability, contingent capacity or uncertainty, and backup flexibility, are examined using comparative studies and numerical computations. Four <b>sourcing</b> methods, namely, single <b>sourcing</b> with contingent supply, dual <b>sourcing,</b> and single <b>sourcing</b> from {{either of the two}} suppliers, are also compared. These findings {{can be used as a}} valuable guideline for companies to select an appropriate <b>sourcing</b> strategy under supply disruption risks...|$|R
