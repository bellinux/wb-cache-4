40|$|International audienceThis study aims to {{describe}} current risk management practices and policies {{across the world}} in relation to personal exposures from devices emitting radiofrequency fields, environmental exposures from fixed installations and exposures in the work environment. Data from 86 countries representing all WHO regions were collected through a survey. The majority of countries (76. 8 %) had <b>set</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> for mobile devices, almost all (90. 7 %) had set public exposure limits for fixed installations and 76. 5 % had specified exposure limits for personnel in occupational settings. A number of other policies had been implemented at the national level, ranging from information provisions on how to reduce personal exposures and restrictions of usage for certain populations, such as children or pregnant women to prevention of access around base stations. This study suggests that countries with higher mobile subscriptions tend to have set radiofrequency exposure limits for mobile devices and to have provisions on exposure measurements about fixed installations...|$|E
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is an {{anthropogenic}} {{gas that}} accumulates in spacecraft to much higher levels than earth-normal levels. Controlling concentrations of this gas to acceptable levels to ensure crew health and optimal performance demands major commitment of resources. NASA has many decades of experience monitoring and controlling CO 2, {{yet we are}} uncertain of the levels at which subtle performance decrements develop. There is limited evidence from ground-based studies that visual disturbances can occur during brief exposures and visual changes have been noted in spaceflight crews. These changes {{may be due to}} CO 2 alone or in combination with other known spaceflight factors such as increased intracranial pressure due to fluid shifts. Discerning the comparative contribution of each to performance decrements is an urgent issue if we hope to optimize astronaut performance aboard the ISS. Long-term, we must know the appropriate control levels for exploration-class missions to ensure that crewmembers can remain cooperative and productive in a highly stressful environment. Furthermore, we must know the magnitude of interindividual variability in susceptibility to the adverse effects of CO 2 so that the most tolerant crewmembers can be identified. Ground-based studies have been conducted for many years to <b>set</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> for submariners; however, these studies are typically limited and incompletely reported. Nonetheless, NASA, in cooperation with the National Research Council, has <b>set</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> for astronauts using this limited database. These studies do not consider the interactions of spaceflight-induced fluid shifts and CO 2 exposures. In an attempt to discern whether CO 2 levels affect the incidence of headache and visual disturbances in astronauts we performed a retrospective study comparing average CO 2 levels and the prevalence of headache and visual disturbances. Our goal is to narrow gaps in the risk profile for in-flight CO 2 exposures. Such studies can provide no more than partial answers to the questions of environmental interactions, interindividual variability, and optimal control levels. Future prospective studies should involve assessment of astronaut well being using sophisticated measures during exposures to levels of CO 2 in the range from 2 to 8 mmHg...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background While much {{attention}} is focused on national policies intended to protect human health from environmental hazards, states can also prevent environmentally mediated disease through legislation and regulation. However, relatively few analyses have examined the extent to which states protect children from chemical factors in the environment. Methods Using Lexis Nexis and other secondary sources, we systematically reviewed environmental regulation and legislation in the fifty states and the District of Columbia as of July 2007 intended to protect children against neurodevelopmental disabilities and asthma. Results States rarely address children specifically in environmental regulation and legislation, though many state regulations go far to limit children's exposures to environmental hazards. Northeast and Midwest states have implemented model regulation of mercury emissions, and regulations in five states <b>set</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> to volatile organic compound emissions that are more stringent than US Environmental Protection Agency standards. Discussion Differences in state environmental regulation and legislation are likely to lead to differences in exposure, and thus to impacts on children's health. The need for further study should not inhibit other states and the federal government from pursuing the model regulation and legislation we identified to prevent diseases of environmental origin in children. </p...|$|E

40|$|Risk {{management}} {{has become a}} primary objective in the management decision. Particularly, in case of investment processes, the focus on risk management is becoming more pronounced, {{as a reaction to}} the increase in the complexity of financial products and processes of analysis, decision and implementation of investment projects. Currently, it is in progress the implementation of the European legislation in the field of investment funds, with a significant orientation towards the regulation of risk management models / processes. In this context, capitalizing the constant concern of the management for effective administration of the risk, SIF Moldova has structured and implemented a risk management model based on capital adequacy that includes quantifiable prudential indicators as objective support which is essential in optimizing the investment decision. As in the secondary legislation that is specific to AIF / AIFM it is not proposed and described a standard method of risk management and it is not stipulated a <b>set</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits,</b> it was decided to develop a model for risk management in accordance with the requirements of AIFM legislation by applying the principles stipulated in the banking norms...|$|E
40|$|A {{descriptive}} study {{was developed in}} order to assess air contamination caused by fungi and particles in seven poultry units. Twenty seven air samples of 25 litters were collected through impaction method. Air sampling and particle concentration measurement were performed in the pavilions’ interior and also outside premises, since this was the place regarded as reference. Simultaneously, temperature and relative humidity were also registered. Regarding fungal load in the air from the seven poultry farms, the highest value obtained was 24040 CFU/m 3 and the lowest was 320 CFU/m 3. Twenty eight species/genera of fungi were identified, being Scopulariopsis brevicaulis (39. 0 %) the most commonly isolated species and Rhizopus sp. (30. 0 %) the most commonly isolated genus. From the Aspergillus genus, Aspergillus flavus (74. 5 %) was the most frequently detected species. There was a significant correlation (r= 0. 487; p= 0. 014) between temperature and the level of fungal contamination (CFU/m 3). Considering contamination caused by particles, in this study, particles with larger dimensions (PM 5. 0 and PM 10) have higher concentrations. There was also a significant correlation between relative humidity and concentration of smaller particles namely, PM 0. 5 (r= 0. 438; p= 0. 025) and PM 1. 0 (r= 0. 537; p= 0. 005). Characterizing typical exposure levels to these contaminants in this specific occupational setting is required to allow a more detailed risk assessment analysis and to <b>set</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> to protect workers’ health...|$|E
