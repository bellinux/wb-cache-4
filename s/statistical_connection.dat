40|$|Objective : The aim of {{this article}} is to {{investigate}} the parallel decline of early baptism and early mortality at the beginning of the demographic transition in a European high-neonatal mortality context. Methods : We use an individual-nominative linked database of 33, 000 births and 10, 000 deaths for 11 parishes in the province of Padua (northeast Italy) from 1816 to 1870. We utilize life tables, logistic regressions, and two-level logistic regressions, including characteristics of the family. Results : Life tables and regression models show that during the winter, the association between early baptism and the risk of death is pronounced. The connection persists also during the summer, when the exposure to low temperature could not influence the risk of death, and a reverse effect could prevail. (Children in periculo mortis were immediately baptized.) Family behaviours influence both early baptism and early death. Conclusions : The data shows clearly that those social groups and families and those areas experiencing the most intense decline in early baptism were also those in which mortality during the first three months of life declined more. However, it is not true that - as suggested by commentators at the time - the strong <b>statistical</b> <b>connection</b> between the two events was just a direct one, with cold exposure exacerbated by early baptism increasing the risk of dying from hypothermia or respiratory diseases. Contribution : We first show that in the province of Padua during the central part of the 19 th century (1816 ‒ 1870), there is a clear and strong <b>statistical</b> <b>connection</b> between the decline of early mortality and the decline of early baptism. Second, we try to disentangle the meaning of this connection...|$|E

40|$|Cache sharing among {{computing}} units {{has become}} increasingly common on modern computer architectures. But the complex cache-level interactions among co-running processes have remained preliminarily understood. As a result, current treatments to cache sharing are primarily reactive. They mainly rely on and respond to runtime monitored low-level program behaviors (e. g., instructions per cycle), no matter whether the goal is a better cache partition or an enhanced job scheduler. The reactive scheme limits the effectiveness and scalability of current shared-cache management. This work aims to contribute some fundamental understandings of shared-cache behavior.

40|$|A {{non-parametric}} {{statistical model}} is constructed to directly relate {{the distribution of}} observed microlens timescales {{to that of the}} mass function of the population from which the lenses are drawn, corrected for observational selection based on timescales and event amplifications. Explicit distributions are derived for microlensing impact parameters and maximum amplifications; both are shown to be statistically independent of all other parameters in the problem, including lens mass. The model is used to demonstrate that the narrow range of microlens timescales observed toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is probably not consistent with lensing by a widely distributed spheroidal population (“dark halo”) of large velocity dispersion, but is consistent with lensing within a rotating thick disk. Poor numerical conditioning of the <b>statistical</b> <b>connection</b> between lens masses and event timescales, and small number statistics, severely limit the mass function information obtainable from current microlensing surveys toward the LMC. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Quasar {{absorption}} lines provide {{detailed information on}} the chemical, kinematic, and ionization conditions in galaxies and their environments, and provide a means for studying the evolution of these conditions back to the epoch of the first quasars. Among the collection of absorbing structures along the lines of sight to quasars there is an evolutionary sequence of galaxies that represent predecessors of the Milky Way and provide a direct view of its history. Absorption spectra of lines of sight through the Milky Way and through nearby galaxies reveal a variety of chemical species, ionization conditions, and kinematic substructures. These absorption profiles are produced by low density gas distributed in rotating disks, high velocity halo clouds, satellite galaxies and their debris, superbubbles, and other sub–galactic gaseous fragments. Guided by knowledge gained by studying nearby galaxies, we are developing interpretations of the variety of observed absorption signatures. Images of z ∼ 1 galaxies responsible for Mgii absorption also allow us to explore the <b>statistical</b> <b>connections</b> between the galaxy properties and their gaseous content.

40|$|Abstract. As memory {{hierarchy}} becomes deeper and shared by more processors, locality increasingly determines system performance. As a rigorous and precise locality model, reuse distance {{has been used}} in program optimizations, performance prediction, memory disambiguation, and locality phase prediction. However, the high cost of measurement has been severely impeding its uses in scenarios requiring high efficiency, such as product compilers, performance debugging, run-time optimizations. We recently discovered the <b>statistical</b> <b>connection</b> between time and reuse distance, which led to an efficient way to approximate reuse distance using time. However, not exposed are some algorithmic and implementation techniques that are vital for the efficiency and scalability of the approximation model. This paper presents these techniques. It describes an algorithm that approximates reuse distance on arbitrary scales; it explains a portable scheme that employs memory controller to accelerate the measure of time distance; it uncovers the algorithm and proof of a trace generator that can facilitate various locality studies. ...|$|E

Outside of cluster cores, we find close structural ties between starburst and continuously starforming, as well as poststarburst and passive types, but not between starbursts and poststarbursts. These results independently support two conclusions presented in Paper II of this ICBS series (Dressler et al.) : 1) most starbursts are the product of a non-disruptive triggering mechanism that is insensitive to global environment, such as minor-mergers; 2) starbursts and poststarbursts generally represent transient phases in the lives of "normal" starforming and quiescent galaxies, respectively, originating from and returning to these systems in closed "recycling" loops.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of spontaneous functional connectivity (sFC) reveals the <b>statistical</b> <b>connections</b> between {{regions of the}} brain consistent with underlying functional communication networks within the brain. In this work, we describe {{the implementation of a}} complete all-to-all network {{analysis of}} resting state neuronal activity from magnetoencephalography (MEG). Using graph theory to define networks at the dipole level, we established functionally defined regions by k-means clustering cortical surface locations using Eigenvector centrality (EVC) scores from the all-to-all adjacency model. Permutation testing was used to estimate regions with statistically significant connections compared to empty room data, which adjusts for spatial dependencies introduced by the MEG inverse problem. In order to test this model, we performed a series of numerical simulations investigating the effects of the MEG reconstruction on connectivity estimates. We subsequently applied the approach to subject data to investigate the effectiveness of our method in obtaining whole brain networks. Our findings indicated that our model provides statistically robust estimates of functional region networks. Application of our phase locking network methodology to real data produced networks with similar connectivity to previously published findings, specifically, we found connections between contralateral areas of the arcuate fasciculus that have been previously investigated. The use of data-driven methods for neuroscientific investigations provides a new tool for researchers in identifying and characterizing whole brain functional connectivity networks. © 2014 Schmidt, Ghuman and Huppert...|$|R
