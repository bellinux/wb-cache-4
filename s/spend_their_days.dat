25|$|The series {{revolves}} around {{the daily lives of}} two 23-year-old friends, Mordecai (a blue jay), and Rigby (a raccoon). They work as groundskeepers at a park, and <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>days</b> trying to avoid work and entertain themselves by any means. This is much to the chagrin of their manager/boss Benson (a gumball machine) and their coworker Skips (a yeti), but to the delight of their (other) manager/boss Pops (a man with a lollipop-shaped head). Other coworkers include an overweight green man called Muscle Man, and a ghost called Hi-Five Ghost.|$|E

50|$|Most species <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>day</b> burrowed {{underground}} {{or under}} vegetation, surfacing only {{at night or}} when it rains. Some species are arboreal and are often seen hiding in bromeliads in trees.|$|R
50|$|These are {{generally}} nocturnal and secretive snakes, <b>spending</b> <b>their</b> <b>days</b> in rock crevices or other animal's burrows {{to avoid the}} desert heat, emerging in the early day to feed on rodents, birds, lizards, and sometimes frogs.|$|R

Amir's father, a wealthy merchant Amir affectionately refers to as Baba, loves both boys, but is often critical of Amir, considering him weak and lacking in courage. Amir finds a kinder fatherly figure in Rahim Khan, Baba's closest friend, who understands him and supports his interest in writing, whereas Baba considers that interest to be worthy only of females.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway's work {{continued}} to be popular {{in the latter half}} of the century and after his suicide in 1961. During the 1970s, The Sun Also Rises appealed to what Beegel calls the lost generation of the Vietnam era. [...] Aldridge writes that The Sun Also Rises has kept its appeal because the novel is about being young. The characters live in the most beautiful city in the world, <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>days</b> traveling, fishing, drinking, making love, and generally reveling in their youth. He believes the expatriate writers of the 1920s appeal for this reason, but that Hemingway was the most successful in capturing the time and the place in The Sun Also Rises.|$|E
500|$|Then one day Tariq appears {{outside the}} house, {{and he and}} Laila are reunited. Laila realizes that Rasheed had hired Abdul Sharif to inform her about Tariq's fake death, {{so that he could}} marry her. When Rasheed returns home from work, Zalmai tells his father about the visitor. Rasheed starts to savagely beat Laila. He nearly {{strangles}} her, but Mariam intervenes and kills Rasheed with a shovel. Afterwards, Mariam confesses to killing Rasheed in order to draw attention away from Laila and Tariq. Mariam is publicly executed, allowing [...] Laila and Tariq to leave for Pakistan with Aziza and Zalmai. They <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>days</b> working at a guest house in Murree, a summer retreat.|$|E

50|$|Scarlet snakes are nocturnal, and {{generally}} <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>day</b> hiding under leaf litter or fallen logs, and venture {{out in the}} evenings to forage for food. They feed on lizards, small rodents, reptile eggs, and even other snakes.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} diurnal, <b>spending</b> <b>their</b> <b>days</b> foraging, basking and {{watching}} over <b>their</b> territories by <b>day</b> and retreating to the treetops at night.

500|$|Ferb and his stepbrother Phineas Flynn <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>days</b> {{during summer}} {{vacation}} from school striving to have fun. They are {{featured in the}} majority of episodes as the A-Plot constructing large scale inventions or taking part in other outlandish activities. Ferb, an engineering genius, allows Phineas to do most of the talking for the pair and is [...] "more of a man of action." [...] When Ferb does speak, it is almost always a single sentence. In a conversation in the future time of [...] "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo", it is revealed that he was at Camp David (hinting that he might be the current President of the United States, although his British background would presumably rule that out).|$|E
500|$|Middle-aged {{siblings}} Vanya and Sonia live in {{the family}} home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. [...] Named after Chekhov's characters by their theater-enthusiast professor parents, Vanya and Sonia have not had to grow up. After spending their adulthood looking after their now-dead parents, neither has a job, and money is provided by their movie star sister Masha, who owns the house and pays the bills. Vanya (who is gay) and Sonia (who is forever reminding everyone that she was adopted) <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>days</b> reflecting on their lost chances, debating whether the grove of nine cherry trees on their property constitutes an orchard, and bemoaning their rather Chekhovian lot in life. The only other resident {{of the house is}} their cleaning woman Cassandra, who, like her namesake, is prone to making dire prophecies that no one believes.|$|E
500|$|According to the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Gautama curses Indra {{to bear a}} {{thousand}} vulvae, which will turn to eyes when he worships the sun-god Surya. Ahalya, though innocent, is turned to stone for sixty thousand years and destined to be redeemed only by Rama's touch. Ahalya accepts the verdict without debate. In another version in the same Purana, Gautama catches Indra fleeing as a cat and curses him with castration. Ahalya's plea of innocence is acknowledged by Gautama, who declares that her mind is pure and she has kept the [...] "vow of chastity and fidelity", but another man's seed has defiled her body. Gautama orders {{her to go to}} the forest and become a stone until rescued by the touch of Rama's feet. In Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka's Telugu rendition, when Indra reluctantly leaves, Gautama arrives and curses Ahalya to become a stone, to be later purified by Rama's feet. After she is freed from the curse, Gautama and Ahalya are reconciled and they <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>days</b> in bed, exploring sexual techniques.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{focused on}} {{the large number of}} styles that Rock Steady incorporates. Eden Miller of PopMatters, noting that Rock Steady {{maintains}} the introspection of Return of Saturn without the latter's [...] "longing and wistfulness", stated that [...] "it is to No Doubt's credit...that they manage to keep the album together with little more than their collective personalities." [...] Blender, however, called it [...] "an intermittently engaging but overall shapeless collection...the product of happy-go-lucky musicians who once cavorted in bad track suits but now <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>days</b> commuting between London, Jamaica and Los Angeles seeking the wisdom of expensive studio geeks." [...] Alex Needham of NME viewed the album's [...] "enormous waterfront of styles" [...] positively, noting that it had many strong potential singles, but found that some of the [...] "empty-headed guitar pop" [...] on {{the second half of the}} album spoiled the listening experience. Kimberly Reyes of Time stated that Rock Steady was able to integrate ska, pop, New Wave, and dancehall [...] "without sounding contrived or chaotic". Reyes added that though the album lacked the energy and sales of No Doubt's 1995 breakthrough album Tragic Kingdom, Rock Steady was [...] "their greatest effort to date...the sound of band dropping pretense to realize its potential." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commenting that [...] "ot since Blondie [...] has a rock act so effortlessly, irreverently, and fashionably skidded across so many different genre boundaries at one time." [...] Lisa Oliver of LAUNCHcast said that [...] "even with so many producers attempting to steer this bus along the superstar highway, they end up in a better-than-most parking lot".|$|E

The large {{mobilization}} of pioneers to the Dakotas in early March prompts Pa to leave immediately on the few days' {{trip to the}} claims office. The girls are left alone and <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>days</b> and nights boarding and feeding all the pioneers passing through. They charge 25 cents for dinner and boarding, starting a savings account toward sending Mary to the School for the Blind in Vinton, Iowa (she does go two books later).|$|E

5000|$|Although mostly diurnal [...] {{and very}} active, they are {{difficult}} to trap and very seldom seen; elephant shrews are wary, well camouflaged, and adept at dashing away from threats. Several species make a series of cleared pathways through the undergrowth and <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>day</b> patrolling them for insect life. If disturbed, the pathway provides an obstacle-free escape route.|$|R
2500|$|Bob Arctor is one {{of these}} {{undercover}} agents, assigned to immerse himself in the drug's underworld and infiltrate the supply chain. Sometime in the past, Arctor abandoned his wife and two children, leaving him alone in a now-rundown suburban house in Anaheim, California; the house has since been repopulated by Arctor's two drug-addicted, layabout housemates: Luckman and Barris. The three <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>days</b> intoxicated and having long, paranoiac conversations. At the police station, Arctor maintains privacy by wearing a [...] "scramble suit" [...] that constantly changes every aspect of his appearance and he is known only by the code name [...] "Fred." [...] Arctor's senior officer, [...] "Hank", and all other undercover officers, also wear scramble suits, protecting their identities even from each other.|$|E
2500|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} women were forced into {{industry}} jobs between 1940-1943. As surveyed by the Ministry of Labour, {{the percentage of women}} in industrial jobs went from 19.75 per cent to 27 per cent from 1938-1945. It was very difficult for women to <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>days</b> in factories, and then come home to their domestic chores and care-giving, and as a result, many women were unable to hold their jobs in the workplace. Britain underwent a labour shortage where an estimated 1.5 million people were needed for the armed forces, and an additional 775,000 for munitions and other services in 1942. It was during this ‘labour famine’ that propaganda aimed to induce people to join the labour force and do their bit in the war. Women were the target audience in the various forms of propaganda because they were paid substantially less than men. It was of no concern whether women were filling the same jobs that men previously held. Even if women were replacing jobs with the same skill level as a man, they were still paid significantly less due to their gender. [...] In the engineering industry alone, the number of skilled and semi-skilled female workers increased from 75 per cent to 85 per cent from 1940-1942. [...] According to Gazeley, even though women were paid less than men, it is clear that women engaging in war work and taking on jobs preserved by men reduced industrial segregation.|$|E
