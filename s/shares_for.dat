5|$|The {{committee}} {{proposed that}} the municipality buy <b>shares</b> <b>for</b> NOK150,000. When the issue was debated in the municipal council on 9 June, it met with resistance from representatives from Tranby in the west of Lier, who stated that they felt that the railway would have no impact on them, and that the municipality should only buy <b>shares</b> <b>for</b> NOK75,000. It resulted in a compromise where the municipality bought <b>shares</b> <b>for</b> NOK100,000. A year later, the municipality purchased <b>shares</b> <b>for</b> an addition NOK30,000. The other major shareholders were Drammen Municipality with NOK30,000, Buskerud County Municipality with NOK50,000 and private investors, who supplied NOK174,050.|$|E
5|$|A buyback of {{preferred}} <b>shares</b> <b>for</b> $530–590million was authorised by the Olympus board. Axam subsequently {{negotiated a}} further {{increase in the}} value of the <b>shares,</b> <b>for</b> which Olympus finally paid $620million in March 2010. According to a UK corporate filing for Gyrus, the value of the securities at the time was disclosed as $177million. Bloomberg notes that executives Olympus had delayed accounting for the true cost of the 'success fees' of Gyrus until March 2011, by which time Axam Investments had been struck off by the Cayman Islands registrar for nine months.|$|E
5|$|Public {{debate about}} {{constructing}} a railway from Lillesand {{up the valley}} following the river Tovdalselva started in the mid-1880s. At the time, lumber was being floated down the river, but low levels of water was causing irregular operations and the piling of lumber in Flaksvand. In 1889, the government for received an application for a concession. Costs were estimated at NOK462,000 and the line {{was passed by the}} Parliament of Norway on 22 June 1891. At the same time, the line received a state funding of NOK200,000. Half of this was share capital, the other half was a subsidy. Aust-Agder County Municipality also gave a grant of NOK20,000, and bought <b>shares</b> <b>for</b> the same amount. Of the share capital of NOK417,350, NOK850 was from private investors and the rest from municipalities. The largest owner was Lillesand Municipality, who bought <b>shares</b> <b>for</b> NOK181,000. Concession was granted by royal resolution on 31 August 1892, and lasted 30 years from the date of the opening of the railway.|$|E

In November 2002, Borgarting Court of Appeal concluded that Norrønafly had the right to continue leasing a hangar—located at the planned location of the venue—until 2014.

5|$|On 2 January 1965, {{the bridge}} {{committee}} recommended that a limited company be established {{to finance the}} bridge. The three archipelago municipalities, Fjell, Sund and Øygarden, would purchase <b>shares</b> <b>for</b> NOK500,000, while another NOK200,000 would be purchased from the mainland municipalities and Hordaland County Municipality. The company was established as A/S Sotrabrua on 16 October 1965, with the head office located in Fjell. The company was given authority by its owners {{to apply for a}} 20-year concession to collect tolls on a new bridge; if the tolls gave a profit beyond covering the debt of the bridge, it was to be used for further construction of roads on Sotra and Øygarden. The company was formally registered on 12 January 1966.|$|E

5|$|Polaris Aircraft Leasing, a {{subsidiary}} of General Electric Capital, entered into agreement in 1993 to suspend lease payments on the airline's three Boeing 747-100SFs in return for an option to buy up to 49 percent of the airline in January 1995. However, Cathay Pacific acquired 75 percent of the airline's <b>shares</b> <b>for</b> HK$200 million in June 1994 and the option was cancelled. Facing weak demands and heavy financial losses, the airline was forced to terminate the lease on its Boeing 707-320C {{and one of its}} Boeing 747-100SF on November 1994 and January 1995, respectively, with only two Boeing 747-100SFs remaining. By 2000, the airline had a fleet of three Boeing 747-200Fs with scheduled cargo services to Brussels, Dubai, Manchester and Osaka.|$|E
5|$|In November, Lyn {{stated that}} they wanted to {{purchases}} the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who {{stated that they}} were now worth NOK10 million. NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they were opposed to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the <b>shares</b> <b>for</b> NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|E

Norsk Data and Kongsberg signed a market sharing agreement on 23 April 1968, in which Kongsberg would deliver computers to the military industry while Norsk Data would deliver to the civilian sector. In the early years, Kongsberg {{would continue to be}} Norsk Data's main competitor as the only other Norwegian manufacturer of minicomputers. Additional Norsk Data shares were issued in May 1968, bringing the share capital to NOK894,000. New investors included Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB), Habberstad and Tharald Brøvig.|$|E

30|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, {{women are}} discriminated against {{in the social}} practice. Only four out of 40 women receive their inheritance property (Sultana 2010) with most not receiving any share in the property (Al-Hibri 2000 – 2002). In contrast, the Islamic model has a fixed portion of property for women (Fowzi 1983). Though a daughter gets half of the son, {{there is always a}} <b>share</b> <b>for</b> her. Under no circumstances is the son allowed to take the daughter’s property. Therefore, we can conclude that while social model does not confirm a certain <b>share</b> <b>for</b> women, the Islamic property law always allocates a certain <b>share</b> <b>for</b> women.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} several object sharing synchronization mechanisms including lock-based, lock-free, and wait-free <b>sharing</b> <b>for</b> LNREF [1], {{an optimal}} real-time scheduling algorithm on multiprocessors. We derive LNREF’s minimum-required space cost for wait-free synchronization using the space-optimal waitfree algorithm. We then establish the feasibility conditions for lock-free and lock-based sharing under LNREF, and the concomitant tradeoffs. While the tradeoff between wait-free versus the other sharing is obvious, i. e., {{space and time}} costs, we show that the tradeoff between lock-free and lock-based <b>sharing</b> <b>for</b> LNREF hinges {{on the cost of}} the lock-free retry, blocking time under lock-based. Finally, we numerically evaluate lock-free and lock-based <b>sharing</b> <b>for</b> LNREF. I...|$|R
