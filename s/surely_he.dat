500|$|In the British House of Lords on 26 July, Brockway pressed Lord Taylor, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, on Rhodesia's claims, {{arguing that}} failure {{to block the}} Lisbon {{appointment}} would amount to conceding de facto recognition to Rhodesia as an independent state. Taylor's response was that Britain remained committed to upholding its ultimate purview over Rhodesian overseas relations. Brockway then asked how Rhodesia had attained its independent office in Pretoria; <b>surely,</b> <b>he</b> said, this provided [...] "a precedent which was rather dangerous?" [...] Taylor replied that Pretoria and Salisbury had exchanged High Commissioners before South Africa left the Commonwealth in 1961, and that Britain had granted Rhodesia special dispensation to retain the Pretoria mission thereafter. He stressed that in Britain's eyes this was no precedent for Lisbon.|$|E
2500|$|A.E. Hotchner alleged, {{among his}} other {{criticisms of the}} 2009 edition, that Seán Hemingway had edited it, in part, to exclude {{references}} to his grandmother (Hemingway's second wife Pauline Pfeiffer) that he found less than flattering. As Hotchner's over-all assessment of the 2009 edition, he wrote: [...] "Ernest was very protective of the words he wrote, words that gave the literary world a new style of writing. <b>Surely</b> <b>he</b> {{has the right to}} have these words protected against frivolous incursion, like this reworked volume that should be called “A Moveable Book”.|$|E

2500|$|For example, one {{may make}} the {{following}} logical reasoning and support it using {{the basis of this}} rule: If, as a given, a parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, surely the parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, ripped pants and a torn shirt. The reasoning is based on pure logic: if the parent is so upset about one item of clothing, <b>surely</b> <b>he</b> or she will be at least that upset about the child's entire ensemble. A somewhat easier construct would be to assert [...] "if a junior varsity basketball player can make a three-pointer, surely an excellent professional basketball player could make the same three-pointer," [...] but this might be attacked as a poor analogy because no one can make every shot.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this point}} Elijah proposes a direct {{test of the}} powers of Baal and the Jewish God. The people of Israel, 450 prophets of Baal, and 400 prophets of Asherah are summoned to Mount Carmel. Two altars are built, one for Baal and one for God. Wood is laid on the altars. Two oxen are {{slaughtered}} and cut into pieces; the pieces are laid on the wood. Elijah then invites the priests of Baal to pray for fire to light the sacrifice. They pray from morning to noon without success. Elijah ridicules their efforts. [...] "At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, ‘Cry aloud! <b>Surely</b> <b>he</b> is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.’" [...] They respond by cutting themselves and adding their own blood to the sacrifice (such mutilation of the body was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic law). They continue praying until evening without success.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Gregg [...] "Opie" [...] Hughes was {{the host}} of The Nighttime Attitude, a late night music radio show on WBAB on Long Island, New York. In an effort to {{capitalize}} on the extensive media coverage of the murder trial of O.J. Simpson, Hughes held a song parody contest for listeners to submit entries based on the trial. Among the thirty or so submissions that he received, one of them was [...] "Gonna Electric Shock O.J." [...] to the tune of [...] "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay" [...] by Otis Redding, performed by Rotgut, a local band featuring Anthony Cumia, a construction worker, on vocals and his brother Joe. The latter travelled to the station while Hughes was doing his show to submit a cassette tape of the parody, and only allowed Hughes to take it. The parody became a hit with the audience, who asked for the song to be played each night. As a result, Hughes invited the Cumias to perform the song live in the studio. Recalled Hughes, [...] "Ant and I instantly had each other the rest of the show. I was like, 'Holy shit, dude. That went pretty well. Why don't you come in next week?' Slowly but <b>surely,</b> <b>he</b> started coming in every week". Using the little funds available at the radio station, Hughes secured a small budget for Cumia to be paid for his appearances, though to Cumia, the money was not an issue as he [...] "just wanted to get a foot in the door" [...] in radio.|$|E

6000|$|Yet, {{there were}} only three months longer of this weary waiting. <b>Surely</b> <b>he</b> could curb his impatience until she was of age and {{mistress}} of her own hand! <b>Surely</b> <b>he</b> trusted her! ...|$|E

60|$|Let us remember, then, that {{whatsoever}} changes, {{still there}} is one who cannot change, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. <b>Surely</b> <b>he</b> can feel for us, when he sees us regret old fashions and old times; <b>surely</b> <b>he</b> does not look on our sadness as foolish, weak, or sinful. It is pardonable, for it is human; and he has condescended to feel it himself, when he wept over Jerusalem.|$|E

[...] she added, as Camp, after a moment's parley with the tramp, turned with him and {{disappeared}} round {{a corner of the}} house. [...] "Now, Mrs. Camp, I think that is really a very bad example. It's encouraging them. Very likely he'll go to sleep in your barn, and set it on fire with his pipe.
