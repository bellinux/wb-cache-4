5|$|At the University of Illinois, Polish-born {{research}} engineer Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner {{was working}} independently {{on a similar}} process. On June 9, 1922, he gave the first reported U.S. demonstration of a sound-on-film motion picture {{to members of the}} American Institute of Electrical Engineers. As with Lauste and Tigerstedt, Tykociner's system would never be taken advantage of commercially; however, De Forest's <b>soon</b> <b>would.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Brezhnev {{replaced}} Khrushchev {{as the new}} General Secretary of the Communist Party, he held ultimate {{political authority}} {{as the leader of}} the Soviet Union. However, he shared collective leadership with Nikolai Podgorny (the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and nominal head of state) and Alexsei Kosygin, the Premier. Brezhnev <b>soon</b> <b>would</b> maximize his grip on power and would be the dominating authority in the collective leadership.|$|E
5|$|In early October the two {{companies}} reached Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where they expected to be restocked with provisions, but no provisions were there for them. The companies had to cut back food rations, hoping that their supplies would last until help could be sent from Utah. To lighten their loads, the Martin Company cut the luggage allowance to 10 pounds (4.5 kg) per person, discarding clothing and blankets that <b>soon</b> <b>would</b> be desperately needed.|$|E

5|$|Osorkon ruled {{during one}} of the most chaotic and {{politically}} fragmented periods of ancient Egypt, in which the Nile Delta was dotted with small Libyan kingdoms and principalities and Meshwesh dominions; as the last heir of the Tanite rulers, he inherited the easternmost parts of these kingdoms, the most involved in all the political and military upheavals that <b>soon</b> <b>would</b> afflict the Near East. During his reign, he had to face the power, and ultimately submit himself—to the Kushite King Piye during Piye's conquest of Egypt. Osorkon IV also {{had to deal with the}} threatening Neo-Assyrian Empire outside his eastern borders.|$|E
5|$|The {{intensity}} of the fire fed by pure oxygen caused the pressure to rise to , which ruptured the Command Module's inner wall at 6:31:19 (23:31:19 GMT, initial phase of the fire). Flames and gases then rushed outside the Command Module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. Intense heat, dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crew's attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the Command Module had exploded, or <b>soon</b> <b>would,</b> and that the fire might ignite the solid fuel rocket in the launch escape tower above the Command Module, which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel, and possibly have destroyed the pad.|$|E

25|$|The battle {{had been}} {{relatively}} bloodless, {{at least by}} standards that <b>soon</b> <b>would</b> be common in the Civil War. On the Union side, only one man was killed, and two soldiers and one seaman were wounded. On the Confederate side, seven were killed outright, two died of wounds, and sixteen were wounded.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference (2008) {{reported}} the belief disconfirmation occurred to the Chabad Orthodox Jewish congregation {{who believed that}} their Rebbe (Menachem Mendel Schneerson) was the Messiah. Yet, when {{he died of a}} stroke in 1994, instead of accepting that their Rebbe was not the Messiah, some of the congregants proved indifferent to that contradictory fact, and chose to continue believing that Schneerson was the Messiah, and <b>soon</b> <b>would</b> return from the dead.|$|E
25|$|In 1524 Governor and Captain General Cortés left Mexico City for Honduras. He {{left the}} {{government}} in charge of Estrada, Rodrigo de Albornoz and Lic. Alonso de Zuazo. Zuazo (or Suazo) held the additional office of Justicia Mayor. The transfer of power occurred October 12, 1524. This triumvirate shared power with the ayuntamiento (city government). The ayuntamiento was composed of partisans of Cortés; Estrada and Albornoz were (or <b>soon</b> <b>would</b> be) his enemies. At one point Estrada issued orders to prevent the reentry of Cortés into Mexico City.|$|E

500|$|In December 1850, Tubman {{was warned}} that her niece Kessiah {{and her two}} children, six-year-old James Alfred, and baby Araminta, <b>soon</b> <b>would</b> be sold in Cambridge. Tubman went to Baltimore, where her {{brother-in-law}} Tom Tubman hid her until the sale. Kessiah's husband, a free black man named John Bowley, made the winning bid for his wife. Then, while the auctioneer stepped away to have lunch, John, Kessiah and their children escaped to a nearby safe house. When night fell, Bowley sailed the family on a log canoe [...] to Baltimore, where they met with Tubman, who brought the family to Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|Melish sent form {{letters to}} {{collectors}} warning that his committee had received offers from speculators {{to buy the}} entire issue and suggesting they act quickly to get their orders in. [...] By the end of July, Melish wrote that 24,000 pieces had been distributed and that the remaining thousand <b>soon</b> <b>would</b> be. Sales were good enough that in February 1937, Melish ordered the 25,000 pieces which remained from the authorized quantity. [...] In addition to those 25,000 coins, 15 more pieces were struck, intended for the 1938 Assay Commission. [...] Because of the legislation, the new pieces resembled the old exactly, including bearing the date [...] "1936". So many were produced that thousands were hoarded by coin dealers. In 1942, Melish offered 16,000 Cleveland Centennial half dollars to prominent dealer Abe Kosoff for any advance on face value. [...] Kosoff, who would, after Melish's death, auction his coin collection, declined.|$|E
500|$|On 12 December 1989, the {{committee}} sent an official offer to Hordaland Public Roads Administration whereby they, {{as a company}} under establishment, offered to fully finance the tunnel. The plans called for tolls of [...] for a car and an investment cost of NOK47 million. The plans were at first nearly discarded by the administration, as they felt {{it was impossible for}} a community of 400 people to finance such a large project without other grants. However, it became evident that the administration was spending NOK2 million per year on the ferry service, and as the ferry <b>soon</b> <b>would</b> have to be replaced, this would increase to NOK3 to 5 million per year. On 1 October 1990, the issue was considered by Hordaland Transport Board, which approved the plans. This was followed up by Hordaland County Council on 19 June 1991, which involved NOK27 million being financed by debt and NOK28 to 33 million being financed through reduced subsidies to the ferry.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s, Khrushchev {{repeatedly}} {{boasted that}} the USSR <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> surpass the West in material well-being. [...] Other communists officials {{agreed that it}} <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> show its superiority, because capitalism was like a dead herring—shining as it rotted.|$|R

500|$|The {{document}} was unilateral in form, describing only what Lobengula {{would do to}} prevent any of these conditions being broken. Shippard was dubious about this {{and the fact that}} none of the izinDuna had signed the proclamation, and asked Robinson if it would be advisable to negotiate another treaty. Robinson replied in the negative, reasoning that reopening talks with Lobengula so <b>soon</b> <b>would</b> only make him suspicious. Britain's ministers at Whitehall perceived the unilateral character of the treaty as advantageous for Britain, as it did not commit Her Majesty's Government to any particular course of action. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister, ruled that Moffat's treaty trumped Grobler's, despite being signed at a later date, because the London Convention of 1884 precluded the South African Republic from making treaties with any state apart from the Orange Free State; treaties with [...] "native tribes" [...] north of the Limpopo were permitted, but the Prime Minister claimed that Matabeleland was too cohesively organised to be regarded as a mere tribe, and should instead be considered a nation. He concluded from this reasoning that the Grobler treaty was ultra vires and legally meaningless. Whitehall soon gave Robinson permission to ratify the Moffat agreement, which was announced to the public in Cape Town on 25 April 1888.|$|E
2500|$|The {{alignment}} of NY121 between Bedford Village to Stone Hill Road (modern NY137), was first described in 1718 {{as a public}} highway through the town of Bedford. The {{alignment of}} modern Cross River Road <b>soon</b> <b>would</b> be designated as Post Road.|$|E
2500|$|The de León couple {{ventured into}} the rice {{production}} business, and <b>soon</b> <b>would</b> be recognized as among the leading rice producers in Luzon. By the 1920s, the couple would own several high-valued real properties in Bulacan, Manila, and other prime locations within Luzon. They also engaged in philanthropic activities and donated a hospital to their hometown of San Miguel.|$|E

2500|$|Some holiday airings of Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy had Charlie McCarthy {{trying to}} recite the poem from memory, {{resulting}} in such lines as: [...] "The stockings were hung by the chimney with care/In hopes that the laundryman <b>soon</b> <b>would</b> be there". (A few times the line went: [...] "In hopes that the room could stand some fresh air"), [...] "He flies through {{the air with the}} greatest of ease/The jolly old elf in the red BVD's", and [...] "Now, Dasher, Now, Dancer, and what do you know/Dasher and Dancer paid $220 to show!" ...|$|E
