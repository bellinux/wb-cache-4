5|$|At 5:31 pm Japan Standard Time (0831UTC) on October27, a Japan Airlines Boeing 767-300 {{heading to}} Narita International Airport, {{encountered}} <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence</b> from Faxai about 74km (46mi) southeast of Narita. The turbulence caused seven injuries on the flight, {{as well as}} some damage to the plane.|$|E
5|$|Little {{change in}} {{strength}} took {{place for the}} next six hours; a shortwave trough crossing the Baja California Peninsula turned Patricia to the northeast and induced acceleration. Another reconnaissance mission around 18:00UTC recorded a central pressure of 879mbar (hPa; 25.96inHg). The aircraft was battered by <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence</b> (the result of updrafts and downdrafts) and the crew experienced maximum g-forces of +3.0 and -1.5.|$|E
50|$|On 16 May 1948, the two pilots of a C-46 (registered NC59489) {{were killed}} when the {{aircraft}} crashed near Port Columbus International Airport at 20:42. They had been flying from New York City to Chicago, when they encountered <b>severe</b> <b>turbulences,</b> in which the rudder of the plane was damaged, rendering it uncontrollable.|$|R
5000|$|With 46 {{fatalities}} (5 {{crew and}} 41 passengers, among them Billy DeBeck's widow), the disaster of Flight 470 on February 14, 1953 marks the worst {{accident in the}} history of National Airlines. The aircraft, a DC-6 registered N90893, crashed into the Gulf of Mexico [...] off Mobile Point en route from Tampa to New Orleans, after having encountered <b>severe</b> <b>turbulences.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although Faxai {{never made}} landfall, outer bands {{associated}} with the storm produced torrential rains, amounting to 458mm (18in) on Miyakejima. A Japan Airlines flight to Narita Airport encountered <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence</b> during the afternoon of October27. One person sustained serious injuries, and five others received minor injuries; the plane was damaged during the event. One person was killed near Tokyo as the storm passed by, and three others were injured. Damages from the storm amounted to ¥150million (US$1.5million).|$|E
5|$|Four {{people were}} killed in the Philippines by Koni, and an {{additional}} person was injured. Damage reports from the Philippines remained scarce, though the PAGASA indicated that damage costs totaled 67.250million Philippine pesos (US$1.26million). On July18, an Airbus A330-242 carrying 242passengers bound for Hong Kong encountered Koni in the South China Sea and attempted to deviate from its planned trajectory in order to avoid severe weather. However, the plane inadvertently encountered an area of <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence,</b> resulting in three minor injuries on board. The plane was later able to exit the area of turbulence and land safely at Hong Kong International Airport.|$|E
5|$|After {{the loss}} of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a court of inquiry to examine {{the cause of the}} accident. Professor Natesan Srinivasan joined the inquiry as the main {{technical}} expert. A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left elevator spar failure in the stabilizer. The inquiry concluded that the aircraft had encountered extreme negative G forces during takeoff; <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence</b> generated by adverse weather was determined to have induced down-loading, leading to {{the loss of}} the wings. Examination of the cockpit controls suggested that the pilot may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered flight controls. Investigators did not consider metal fatigue as a contributory cause.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modeling method {{based on a}} fuzzy-logic algorithm to establish aerodynamic models by using the datasets from flight data recorder (FDR). The fuzzy-logic aerodynamic models are utilized to estimate more accurately the nonlinear unsteady aerodynamics for a transport aircraft, including the effects of atmospheric turbulence. The main objective in {{this paper is to}} present the model development and the resulting models with continuous differentiability. The uncertainty and correlation of the data points are estimated and improved by monitoring a multivariable correlation coefficient in the modeling process. The latter is increased by applying a least square method to a set of data points to train a set of modeling coefficients. A commercial transport aircraft encountered <b>severe</b> atmospheric <b>turbulence</b> twice at transonic flight in descending phase is the study case in the present paper. The robustness and nonlinear interpolation capability of the fuzzy-logic algorithm are demonstrated in predicting the degradation in performance and stability characteristics of this transport in <b>severe</b> atmospheric <b>turbulence</b> with sudden plunging motion...|$|R
5|$|Because the {{aviation}} industry is especially {{sensitive to the}} weather, accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards. Thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence</b> due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries, icing due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large hail, strong winds, and lightning, {{all of which can}} cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight. Volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation, as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds. On a day-to-day basis airliners are routed {{to take advantage of the}} jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency. Aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination. Additionally, airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind. This reduces the distance required for takeoff, and eliminates potential crosswinds.|$|E
25|$|These {{clouds are}} {{sometimes}} classified {{separately from the}} other vertical or multi-level types because {{of their ability to}} produce <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{were able}} to {{conclude}} that there was significant foul weather and <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence</b> in the area at the time Flight 923 was attempting to land at Annette Island. Furthermore, the incorrect weather report by the Pan Am meteorologist left the pilot unaware of the turbulence and high winds he would encounter on approach. The CAB postulated that <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence</b> or severe icing may have caused the pilot to lose control of the aircraft. However this could not be declared the definitive cause of the accident due to insufficient evidence.|$|E
50|$|BOAC Flight 911 (Speedbird 911) was a round-the-world flight {{operated}} by British Overseas Airways Corporation that crashed {{as a result}} of an encounter with <b>severe</b> clear-air <b>turbulence</b> near Mount Fuji in Japan on 5 March 1966. The Boeing 707-436 on this flight was commanded by Captain Bernard Dobson, 45, from Dorset, an experienced 707 pilot who had been flying these aircraft since November 1960.|$|R
50|$|On 11 March 1982 Flight 933 {{crashed into}} the Barents Sea between Berlevåg and Mehamn, killing all fifteen people on board the Twin Otter. The {{accident}} was caused by structural failure in the rudder and vertical stabilizer following <b>severe</b> clear-air <b>turbulence.</b> A conspiracy theory concerning a collision with a British Harrier fighter led to four investigations, none of which found any evidence of a collision.|$|R
2500|$|On January 7, 2017, a Canadair CL-600-2B16 Challenger 604 lost {{altitude}} of nearly 9,000 feet {{as a result}} of <b>severe</b> wake <b>turbulence</b> from an Airbus A380. Despite substantial damage to the aircraft, the pilots managed to safely land the jet at Muscat Airport. However, the airplane was a written off due to the damage it suffered. All 9 passengers and crew members survived but many of them suffered serious injuries during the incident.|$|R
25|$|On 16 July 2014 South African Airways Flight SA286, an Airbus A340-313 {{en route}} from Johannesburg to Hong Kong, hit <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence,</b> {{injuring}} 25 passengers and 3 crew members, the aircraft landed safely at Hong Kong International Airport.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport was}} opened on 1 July 1975 {{as the only}} public airport serving Nordfjord, {{four years after the}} other {{regional}} airports in Sogn og Fjordane. Originally the airport was served with de Havilland Canada Twin Otters. The airport was plagued with <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence</b> and low regularity. A terminal expansion took place in 1987 and the runway was slightly expanded in 2010.|$|E
25|$|The CAB, upon {{reviewing}} available weather data, {{determined that}} the Pan Am meteorologist {{should have been able}} to predict, with some amount of certainty, that there would be <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence</b> at lower altitude and high winds. This data would have been available for the meteorologist to make such a prediction prior to or shortly after Flight 923's departure from Seattle. Such a forecast would have warned the crew of the weather conditions they encountered when they decided to abort their landing at Annette Island airport.|$|E

5|$|On 11 March 1982 Widerøe Flight 933 {{crashed into}} the Barents Sea between Berlevåg and Mehamn Airport, after having made two {{intermediate}} stops since leaving Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. All fifteen people on board the Twin Otter were killed. The accident was caused by structural failure in the rudder and vertical stabilizer following <b>severe</b> clear-air <b>turbulence.</b> A conspiracy theory arose concerning a collision with a British Harrier fighter, which resulted in four investigations—none which found any evidence of a collision.|$|R
25|$|His reign {{was marked}} by <b>severe</b> {{political}} <b>turbulence,</b> as Mauritania extracted itself from the war with the Polisario Front — started by Ould Daddah in 1975 — and his regime faced a number of coup attempts and military intrigues. On March 16, 1981 a coup attempt against Haidalla failed,. Haidalla accused Morocco of being behind the coup, which Morocco denied, {{and in the next}} month Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya was appointed Prime Minister. Another attempted coup was allegedly sponsored by Libya.|$|R
25|$|On 3 March 2001, a C-23B Sherpa {{belonging}} to the 171st Aviation Regiment of the Florida Army National Guard was carrying 18 construction workers from Hurlburt Field (Florida) to Naval Air Station Oceana (Virginia). The pilot left the flight deck to use the aft bathroom. His weight in the tailcone shifted {{the center of gravity}} sufficiently (later calculations determined that the aircraft had been loaded outside its operating envelope {{at the start of the}} flight) that the airplane became unstable when a patch of <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence</b> was encountered. The violent g-force shifts then encountered rendered the crew unconscious and caused the breakup of the aircraft in flight near Unadilla, Georgia, killing the 21 persons on board.|$|E
500|$|With {{starting}} quarterback John David Booty {{still recovering from}} a broken finger on his throwing hand, USC elected to start Mark Sanchez for the secondstraight week.

500|$|At {{the time}} of peak intensity, an {{unmanned}} weather reconnaissance vehicle, known as Aerosonde, was flown into the typhoon and recorded peak winds of [...] {{at an altitude of}} [...] As the storm approached Taiwan late on October1, an eyewall replacement cycle began, with a large secondary eyewall forming around the inner one. At 1848UTC, Doppler weather radar velocity estimates indicated winds of 240km/h (145mph) at an altitude of [...] An interpolated surface pressure of 924.5mb (hPa; 27.30inHg) was obtained based on the Aerosonde's data. After flying in the storm for ten hours, the unmanned vehicle encountered <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence</b> and crashed about [...] east of Taitung City. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan [...] caused Longwang to weaken somewhat. The system ultimately made landfall near Hualien City at 0500UTC on October2.|$|E
500|$|During its {{formative}} stage, a high-pressure area {{combined with}} the low pressure of Marco resulted in a tight pressure gradient which led to beach erosion and gale force winds on the Florida coast. In Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties, heavy surf generated by the combination of those systems caused [...] of beach erosion. Additionally, [...] of top sand were lost in that region. Further north, severe beach erosion caused the loss {{of as much as}} [...] of the dune line in Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie, and Martin counties. Other impact was minimal. Marco was one of few hurricanes to enter the Caribbean Sea and not make landfall. Also, Hurricane Hunter flights recorded volatile center structure with <b>severe</b> <b>turbulence,</b> extreme rainfall, and hail during a flight into the storm. Overall, Marco caused 14fatalities and approximately $8.2million in damage.|$|E
500|$|After {{entering}} the Caribbean Sea, Hazel continued {{to present a}} small eye and wind diameter.
