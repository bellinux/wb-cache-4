25|$|The {{ship had}} a {{deadweight}} tonnage, or carrying capacity, of approximately 81,000 tons, a measurement that {{put it at}} the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> of the Aframax class of tankers, smaller than most carriers of crude oil but larger than most carriers of refined products. It was classed by the American Bureau of Shipping and insured by the London Steam-Ship Owners' Mutual Insurance Association, a shipowners' mutual known as the London Club.|$|E
25|$|The {{hobo spider}} (Eratigena agrestis, {{formerly}} Tegenaria agrestis) {{is a member}} of the genus of spiders known colloquially as funnel web spiders, but not to be confused with the Australian funnel-web spider. The medical significance of its bite is still poorly understood and debated. Individuals construct a funnel-shaped structure of silk sheeting and lie in wait at the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> of the funnel for prey insects to blunder onto their webs. Hobo spiders sometimes build their webs in or around human habitations.|$|E

25|$|The bridge, {{sometimes}} {{made of a}} fruitwood, {{is attached}} to the soundboard typically between a fifth and a seventh of the belly length. It does not have a separate saddle but has holes bored into it to which the strings attach directly. The bridge is made so that it tapers in height and length, with the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> holding the trebles and the higher and wider end carrying the basses. Bridges are often colored black with carbon black in a binder, often shellac and often have inscribed decoration. The scrolls or other decoration on the ends of lute bridges are integral to the bridge, and are not added afterwards as on some Renaissance guitars (cf Joachim Tielke's guitars).|$|E
2500|$|Setup and {{production}} of shell mold patterns takes weeks, after which an output of 5–50pieces/hr-mold is attainable. Common materials include cast iron, aluminum and copper alloys. Aluminum and magnesium products average about [...] as a normal limit, {{but it is possible}} to cast items in the [...] range.

The county is roughly {{in the shape of}} a rectangle [...] by , with the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> slanting in a northwest-southeast direction. It has no incorporated areas. Its county seat is the census-designated place (CDP) of Arlington, which is coterminous with the boundaries of the county; however, the county courthouse and most government offices are located in the Courthouse neighborhood.|$|E
50|$|A double-tapped bushing is {{more compact}} than a reducer, {{but not as}} flexible. While a double-tapped bushing has a smaller female thread {{concentric}} to a larger male thread (and thus couples a <b>smaller</b> male <b>end</b> to a larger female), a reducer may have large and <b>small</b> <b>ends</b> of either gender. If both ends are the same gender, it is a gender-changing reducer.|$|R

60|$|Meanwhile, Trot, being {{invisible}} to all, was roaming around the room, and behind a bench {{she found a}} <b>small</b> <b>end</b> of rope, which she picked up. Then she seated herself in an out-of-the-way place and quietly waited.|$|E
60|$|I {{almost felt}} her warm breath as she stole past me. I caught a gleam of a pale face, {{sufficient}} {{to tell me}} who she was. She passed on and took up her stand outside that <b>small</b> <b>end</b> window.|$|E
50|$|The {{main flow}} is crossed by a four-span stone arch bridge, having two large central spans and two much <b>smaller</b> <b>end</b> spans. This bridge {{was built in}} the 1660s, and {{originally}} named Chapelizod Bridge.|$|R

60|$|Full-sized {{specimens}} of this animalcule attain {{a length of}} between 1/300 or 1/400 of an inch, so {{that it may have}} ten times the length and a thousand times the mass of a Heteromita. In shape, it is not altogether unlike Heteromita. The <b>small</b> <b>end,</b> however, is not produced into one long cilium, but the general surface of the body is covered with small actively vibrating ciliary organs, which are only longest at the <b>small</b> <b>end.</b> At the point which answers to that from which the two cilia arise in Heteromita, there is a conical depression, the mouth; and, in young specimens, a tapering filament, which reminds one of the posterior cilium of Heteromita, projects from this region.|$|E

50|$|While {{the general}} range of P. gibbosus size is 10-12 mm in length, females are usually {{closer to the}} <b>smaller</b> <b>end</b> of the scale. Female P. gibbosus have more yellow {{coloration}} on the head than do the males of the species.|$|R
5000|$|The novel further {{describes}} an intra-Lilliputian quarrel over {{the practice of}} breaking eggs. Traditionally, Lilliputians broke boiled eggs on the larger end; a few generations ago, an Emperor of Lilliput, the Present Emperor's great-grandfather, had decreed that all eggs be broken on the <b>smaller</b> <b>end</b> after his son cut himself breaking the egg on the larger end. The differences between Big-Endians (those who broke their eggs at the larger end) and Little-Endians had given rise to [...] "six rebellions... wherein one Emperor lost his life, and another his crown". The Lilliputian religion says an egg should be broken on the convenient end, which is now interpreted by the Lilliputians as the <b>smaller</b> <b>end.</b> The Big-Endians gained favour in Blefuscu.|$|R
60|$|But {{two hundred}} a {{year was a}} great deal to George. That morning he had been very much puzzled to think how he was to keep himself going till {{he might be able to}} open the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> of the law's golden eggs.|$|E

6000|$|Soon {{after this}} I {{returned}} to my seat; the cone was lifted {{high into the air}} silently, broken apart, and then, with the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> jangling inside the larger one, was carried over the table and back to the floor. It fell with a bang that seemed final and decisive. [...] "That is 'good-bye,'" [...] said Mrs. Smiley.|$|E
60|$|The trumpet {{with which}} the calling is done is simply a piece of birch bark, rolled up {{cone-shaped}} with the smooth side within. It is fifteen or sixteen inches long, about four inches in diameter at the larger, and one inch at the <b>smaller</b> <b>end.</b> The right hand is folded round the <b>smaller</b> <b>end</b> for a mouthpiece; into this the caller grunts and roars and bellows, {{at the same time}} swinging the trumpet's mouth in sweeping curves to imitate the peculiar quaver of the cow's call. If the bull is near and suspicious, the sound is deadened by holding the mouth of the trumpet close to the ground. This, to me, imitates the real sound more accurately than any other attempt.|$|R
50|$|After {{the iris}} has flowered, it {{produces}} an oval seed capsule, which is 2.5 - 3.5 cm long.The seeds {{come out of}} the capsule via lateral slits, they are 5mm long and pear shaped. They have a whitish, ring shaped aril (appendage), on the <b>smaller</b> <b>end.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many model figures {{used for}} gaming are {{measured}} in millimeters ranging from 15 to 80 mm with miniature wargaming figures {{running on the}} <b>smaller</b> <b>end</b> especially where armored vehicles are used.

60|$|Assuredly {{this man}} {{deserved}} the deepest gratitude of the nation, for {{his was the}} first lifeboat ever brought into action, and he inserted the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> of that wedge which we have been hammering home ever since, and which {{has resulted in the}} formation of one of the grandest, most thoroughly national and unsectarian of our charitable institutions.|$|E
60|$|And he {{attempted}} {{a pat on}} Philammon's head, which, as there was a head and shoulder's difference between them, might on the whole have been considered, from a theatric point of view, as a failure. Whereon the little man seized the calabash of beer, and filling therewith a cow's horn, his thumb on the <b>small</b> <b>end,</b> raised it high in the air.|$|E
60|$|Last {{came the}} turn of the third fairy. 'This one has a horn slung round him. When he blows at the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> the seas shall be covered with ships. And if he blows at the wide end they shall all be sunk in the waves.' So they vanished, without knowing that Ciccu had been awake and heard all they said.|$|E
5000|$|Caber toss: A long log is stood {{upright and}} hoisted by the {{competitor}} who balances it vertically holding the <b>smaller</b> <b>end</b> {{in his hands}} (see photo). Then the competitor runs forward attempting to toss {{it in such a}} way that it turns end over end with the upper (larger) end striking the ground first. The <b>smaller</b> <b>end</b> that was originally held by the athlete then hits the ground in the 12 o'clock position measured relative to the direction of the run. If successful, the athlete is said to have turned the caber. Cabers vary greatly in length, weight, taper, and balance, all of which affect the degree of difficulty in making a successful toss. Competitors are judged on how closely their throws approximate the ideal 12 o'clock toss on an imaginary clock.|$|R
50|$|Historically the CFL {{ball was}} {{slightly}} larger, {{both because of}} slightly bigger specifications, but also because CFL manufacturers tended to make balls at the larger end of the allowed tolerances as opposed to NFL manufacturers who built balls to the <b>smaller</b> <b>end.</b> However, the CFL updated its specifications in 1985.|$|R
