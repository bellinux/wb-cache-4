25|$|Within the library, {{there are}} several areas {{designated}} for specific groups or courses of study. The first floor {{is home to the}} Center for Rural Students, the periodical archives and the current print periodicals. The second floor houses the majority of the book collection, the <b>Senator</b> <b>Graham</b> S. Newell Vermont room, the Vermont Room historical collection, the college archives, the children’s collection, a computer lab, the Information Technology department, and the Instructional Materials Center, which contains teaching resources for students entering the education field.|$|E
25|$|When Lyndon State College {{relocated}} {{to its new}} home {{on the top of}} Vail Hill in 1951, the library that had been at the nearby Lyndon Institute (where the college began as a teacher education program) was moved to Vail Manor and housed in one of the mansion's twin towers. Twelve thousand volumes were moved by hand in one weekend. In 1965, the library expanded into its own building in what is now the Harvey Academic Center. Lyndon Professor Emeritus and Vermont state <b>senator</b> <b>Graham</b> S. Newell selected Samuel Read Hall as the library’s namesake. In 1972, the current library building was opened, and in 1980, the building won a design award from the American Institute of Architects for being a “bridge” from one side of campus to the other. By 1994, however, the library and the college had both outgrown their space, and so {{the decision was made to}} expand the library building into what would become known as the Library Academic Center, or LAC. The renovated building, which opened in 1995, added one floor of library space and one floor of classrooms.|$|E

2500|$|The 1933 Outer Banks Hurricane {{which made}} {{landfall}} on September 15 would forever change {{the economy of}} Harkers Island. The storm was blamed for at least 21 fatalities in North Carolina (although none on Harkers Island) and an estimated $1million USD of damage. The storm surge damaged fisheries and inland waterways, {{but there was one}} unexpected beneficial result. Retreating storm surge and heavy rainfall combined to carve out a new channel in the Banks, separating the Core Banks from the Shackleford Banks near the Cape Lookout Lighthouse. This new channel gave Harkers Island fishermen a new, direct access route to offshore fishing grounds. [...] The new channel was named Barden Inlet after US <b>Senator</b> <b>Graham</b> Barden, who sponsored legislation to require that the United States Army Corps of Engineers use dredging equipment to maintain the new channel.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, {{along with}} Democratic Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Arlen Specter (R-PA), [...] {{had been working}} with John Ashcroft on a draft bill, called the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001. On September 19, 2001 this first draft is {{introduced}} to Congress. Many {{of the most controversial}} aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act were first part of this draft and it was later to be introduced as the PATRIOT Act/USA Act [...] which in turn became the basis for the final USA PATRIOT Act. Among other things, the administration proposal discussed extending roving wiretaps from the sole domain of domestic agencies into the domain of foreign intelligence surveillance and proposed the expansion of the use of wiretaps from phonelines to Internet technology. It would have made it possible for more law enforcement agencies to disseminate wiretap information and would have expanded the scope of surveillance subpoenas to allow broader access to personal records [...] including [...] "books, records, papers, documents, and other items." [...] Both the bill introduced by <b>Senator</b> <b>Graham</b> and the proposed Anti-Terrorism Act draft were referred to the Select Committee on Intelligence. According to The Washington Post, EPIC's Jim Dempsey {{and a number of other}} representatives from other civil liberties groups were invited to discussions about the draft, but Dempsey's recollection was that [...] "They [...] were livid, [...] explicitly said, 'We don't think outsiders should be here, and we won't talk unless they leave the room.'" [...] Though a deal was brokered, this began causing tensions between parties negotiating the bill and previously amicable discussions started breaking down between Leahy and Ashcroft.|$|E

5000|$|On the {{question}} of what a Strict constructionist is, Alito again agreed with <b>Senator</b> <b>Graham,</b> stating it was a judge who did not make it up. <b>Senator</b> <b>Graham</b> asked whether a President who interprets the Congressional authorization for the Use of Force as giving him the right to wire-tap without getting a FISA warrant is ... <b>Senator</b> <b>Graham</b> said that his point a la Justice Jackson (in the Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer case) was not aimed at Alito but [...] "at the audience". <b>Senator</b> <b>Graham</b> is worried about the [...] "chilling effect" [...] of a President who goes too far, leaving Congress gun-shy about granting the executive branch the [...] "Use of Force" [...] (i.e. declining to pass a War Resolution). Graham hinted at the 60-vote requirement for breaking a so-called filibuster (actually invoking cloture). Alito did not take the bait over whether any statute or rule could be made to overrule the simple majority that the Constitution requires for confirming a Supreme Court Justice.|$|E
5000|$|Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) asked Alito {{questions}} about enemy combatants, and the Hamdi v. Rumsfeld and Rumsfeld v. Padilla cases. Graham asked whether there {{have ever been}} any cases in which a foreign non-citizen soldier/fighter brought suit in a U.S. court. Alito was asked whether any enemy prisoner of war ever brought a federal habeas corpus case. There were two cases, the Six Saboteurs, Ex parte Quirin where even U.S. citizens are not entitled to federal courts but allowed only military tribunals. Then the second case involving six Germans caught assisting Japanese (Johnson v. Eisentrager) who were sent to Germany; they brought an unsuccessful habeas corpus case. They were held [...] "not in U.S. territory". Graham said, [...] "We don't let people trying to kill us sue us." [...] Alito said that [...] "he wouldn't put it" [...] so strongly. Alito said that {{we also need to}} take note of Ex Parte Milligan from the Civil War. <b>Senator</b> <b>Graham</b> disagreed. Alito agreed with <b>Senator</b> <b>Graham</b> that the military has expertise on who is and who is not a prisoner of war. However, the treatment of detainees, according to Graham, is a different matter. <b>Senator</b> <b>Graham</b> asked whether Alito is {{proud of the fact that}} the USA is a signatory to the Geneva Convention. <b>Senator</b> <b>Graham</b> asked whether if someone were caught whether here or abroad a la Hamdan the Geneva Convention would give the prisoner a private right of action. <b>Senator</b> <b>Graham</b> pointed out that where he differed from some others is on the question of torture. Graham asked whether any President can disregard the federal statute against torture—making it a crime—even in war. Alito said [...] "the President is not above the law." ...|$|E
