This freedom, {{as might be}} expected, is most important in the long distance telephone plant where trunks are. frequently too long or have no conductors. for dc signaling. The general plan of signal frequency (SF) signaling is based upon continuous signaling because of it’s speed and reliability. In this respect {{it is like the}} usual dc trunk signaling schemes. SF uses steady current in the trunk <b>signaling</b> <b>path</b> for the normal idle trun]~ condition and no current in the <b>signaling</b> <b>path.</b> for the other a ~ alternate b~sy (talking) trunk condition. This choice of signal conditions is essential for SF signaling in-band systems, which as the name implies operate within the standard voice channel, to avoid conflict between signal and voice trans-mission. The same conditions are also used in SF out-of-band and separate line systems. The in-band SF system can be used with any type or length q ~ line. facility that meets nor~nal voice transmission requirements and is there. fore the pre-ferred method used by the Bell System to meet requirements for toll dialing on a national basis, with Other signaling arrangements limited to the shorter trunks.
