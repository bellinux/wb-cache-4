5|$|As {{indicated}} in the table below, each basin uses a separate system of terminology, which can make comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse will occur. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s), over , are called Super Typhoons by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that {{they appear to be}} sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|In addition, other {{characters}} have supporting roles {{in this game}} as well. Lakitu reprises {{his role as the}} referee, helping racers in various situations such as announcing laps, giving the signal to drive with its traffic lights hanging on a fishing pole, and taking characters back on track in case they fall off course. Other supporting characters appearing in this game include Shy Guys, Goombas, Nokis, Toadsworth, Piantas, Chain Chomps, Piranha Plants and more. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that this is the very first time that Toadette has appeared in the Mario franchise.|$|E
50|$|It <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that there's {{an entire}} roster of demons who aren't {{identified}} {{as belonging to}} any specific species.|$|R

25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that GWR's oldies {{service was}} {{originally}} called Brunel Classic Gold, after the Great Western Railway's founding father Isambard Kingdom Brunel.|$|E
25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that correctional {{officers}} at Central Booking were {{rumored to be}} on a work slowdown during this time. Corrections personnel are prohibited from striking.|$|E
25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> {{that the}} amine {{solution}} {{to and from}} the recycle gas contactor comes from and is returned to the refinery's main amine gas treating unit.|$|E
3000|$|..., then A-statistical {{convergence}} {{is stronger}} than usual convergence [10]. It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> {{that the concept of}} A-statistical convergence may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> given in normed spaces [12].|$|R
30|$|It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> {{that since}} the method of proof of Theorem  3 is totally {{constructive}} it automatically provides an algorithm for explicit construction of optimal meshes in star-like domains.|$|R
5000|$|It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> that in 1932 {{there was}} another [...] "Riders of the Purple Sage" [...] for {{approximately}} two years on the West Coast in the L.A. area formed by Jack Dalton.|$|R
25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that, like in Highway Patrol before it, {{several of}} this {{generation}} Century appeared in the US television series Kojak, driven by Telly Savalas and other squadroom members.|$|E
25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that Bianca Acquaye-Froese, Edgar's widow, {{has taken}} up the mantle of {{continuing}} {{the legacy of the}} group and works closely in a non-musical capacity with the remaining members.|$|E
25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> {{that the}} Qing court {{exercised}} effective sovereignty over primarily {{the west coast}} of Taiwan only, and even then did not regard the area {{as an integral part of}} national Chinese territory.|$|E
3000|$|... {{after such}} annealing. It <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that the 'SRSO sublayer' {{fabricated}} {{under the same}} conditions and alternated with SiO 2 sublayer has a high emission. Hence one can conclude {{that the presence of}} the SiN [...]...|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} time since the 1999 season, the team {{finishing}} in 8th spot won more games than it had lost. It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> that on that occasion, 17 teams were in the competition.|$|R
5000|$|... == Awards == Chikaskia {{received}} six battle {{stars for}} World War II service and one star for Korean war service.It <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted,</b> that this old warhorse served refueling support ships during the [...] "Bay of Pigs" [...] operation.|$|R
25|$|Another son of Mikhail's, Dmitry Mikhailovich (1721–1793), was the Russian {{ambassador}} in Vienna {{during the reign}} of Catherine the Great. Primarily remembered for the splendid Golitsyn Hospital he opened in Moscow, he <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> as a great friend and patron of Mozart.|$|E
25|$|The figures below {{come from}} Eurostat (2013) and are denoted in Euros, it notes the {{economic}} position of Scottish regions {{in terms of}} GDP and GDP per capita. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that the Scottish figures exclude offshore oil revenue. There are 26 areas in the UK where the GDP per person is under €20,000.|$|E
25|$|According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, as of 2005, 650,000 Israelis {{had left}} the country for over one year and not returned. Of them, 530,000 are still alive today. This number {{does not include the}} {{children}} born overseas. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that Israeli law grants citizenship only to the first generation of children born to Israeli emigrants.|$|E
5000|$|It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> {{that the}} term [...] "Puroresu" [...] in Japan refers to all {{professional}} wrestling, regardless of country of origin. For example, American promotions WWE and Global Force Wrestling {{are referred to as}} [...] "Puroresu" [...] in Japan.|$|R
30|$|Clearly, since 1 <α< 2 in (7) it {{provides}} a sharper Bernstein type inequality than (5), but only for tangential derivatives of the polynomial. It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> that when α = 2 (7) becomes a uniform Markov type estimate of order n.|$|R
50|$|It <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> {{that the}} visuals do not {{constitute}} true hallucinations in the clinical sense of the word; people with HPPD recognize the visuals to be illusory, or pseudohallucinations, and thus maintain the ability {{to determine what is}} real (in contrast to some mental illnesses such as schizophrenia).|$|R
25|$|Each cell {{division}} from a spermatogonium to a spermatid is incomplete; the cells remain connected {{to one another}} by bridges of cytoplasm to allow synchronous development. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that not all spermatogonia divide to produce spermatocytes; otherwise, the supply of spermatogonia would run out. Instead, spermatogonial stem cells divide mitotically to produce copies of themselves, ensuring a constant supply of spermatogonia to fuel spermatogenesis.|$|E
25|$|In {{his final}} year to early March 2013 the Club lost all six matches in the Heineken Cup and {{recorded}} four league victories all {{season in the}} Pro12 against Cardiff, Zebre, Connacht and the Ospreys. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that Edinburgh Rugby accumulated seven losing bonus points in this period highlighting the need for minor adjustments to change the sides fortunes on the pitch.|$|E
25|$|Claims that {{hydrogen}} peroxide therapy increase cellular levels of oxygen {{have not been}} supported. The quantities administered {{would be expected to}} provide very little additional oxygen compared to that available from normal respiration. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> {{that it is difficult to}} raise the level of oxygen around cancer cells within a tumour, as the blood supply tends to be poor, a situation known as tumor hypoxia.|$|E
30|$|Compared to {{our system}} {{the same number}} of {{messages}} is required. Nevertheless, messages 1 to 4 are usually sent once, since tokens never expire. It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> that the entity that performs the authorization is the drive owner herself (the consumer), therefore authorization is a manual process.|$|R
30|$|It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> {{that our}} results lead {{in a natural}} way to some {{existence}} theorems for differential and difference inclusions or impulsive problems (for particular measures). Moreover, as claimed in [9], measure-driven differential inclusions provide a convenient framework for formulating optimal control problems for both conventional and impulse controls.|$|R
50|$|It <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> of <b>note</b> that, in the {{majority}} of Europe, fixed stages were more common than wagons, and the sites of the fixed stages varied from place to place. In Rome the ancient amphitheatres were used, and in places like Mons, France and Frankfurt-am-Main in Germany, town squares were the primary auditorium.|$|R
25|$|Their Christian and Muslim neighbors once {{looked upon}} the Abayudaya with disdain and hatred, but {{relations}} have improved significantly and some view {{members of the}} Abayudaya with respect and admiration. It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that the community has been growing at a steady rate. Numbering only 300 individuals {{at the time of}} the fall of Idi Amin, the Abayudaya have grown to as many as 2,000 individuals since that time.|$|E
25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that UK {{legislation}} considers all lights, reflectors {{and reflective}} material to be lights, and all items resembling special warning beacons (of any color) must be covered {{and not just}} disconnected (as this is a separate offence) while on the public highway. Similarly, no distinction is made between lights mounted on light bars and those mounted anywhere else on the vehicle (e.g. headlights, indicators, brake lights) - all are covered by the same regulations.|$|E
25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that it {{was usually}} only the frigates which took prizes; the ships of the line were far too {{ponderous}} {{to be able to}} chase and capture the smaller ships which generally carried treasure. Nelson always bemoaned that he had done badly out of prize money and even as a flag officer received little. This was not that he had a bad command of captains but rather that British mastery of the seas was so complete that few enemy ships dared to sail.|$|E
30|$|It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> that p(FA) and p(miss) in Tables  6 and 7 do {{not relate}} to ATWV {{performance}} but to MTWV performance (i.e., with the a posteriori best decision threshold). In this way, systems with MTWV = 0.0 (i.e., {{those that do not}} generate detections at best decision threshold) obtain p(FA)= 0.0 and p(miss)= 1.0.|$|R
30|$|It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> that an {{in depth}} {{analysis}} of results obtained from the NAIADE model can provide useful inferences for planners and decision makers in the study area, as to potential strong stakeholders’ alliances that oppose to planning solutions or strong conflicts among stakeholders, both of which need to be properly handled for improving implementation potential of the final planning decision.|$|R
30|$|It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> that routers <b>are</b> {{assumed to}} have {{different}} radio coverage, therefore to any router could be linked {{to a number of}} clients and other routers. Obviously, whenever a router is moved to another cell of the grid area, the information on links to both other routers and clients must be computed again and links are re-established.|$|R
