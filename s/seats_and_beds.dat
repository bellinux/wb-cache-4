Voices rose at intervals from beyond the partition, but they ceased at last and only an occasional crackle of the dry grass that served for <b>seats</b> <b>and</b> <b>bedding</b> told that one at least of the rustlers was keeping watch. George felt his limbs quiver while he waited, and he was conscious of an unpleasant tension on his nerves.

40|$|An {{apparatus}} and procedure are described for evaluating the toxicity of the gases evolved from the smoldering combustion of <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> <b>bedding</b> materials. The method combines initiation of smoldering combustion in fabric/cushion combinations by a lighted cigarette and exposure of laboratory animals to the gases evolved. The ratio of the surface available for smoldering to the compartment volume in this apparatus is approximately five times the ratio expected in a California living room, and 100 times the ratio expected in a wide-body aircraft passenger cabin. Based on fabric/cushion combinations tested, the toxicity of gases from smoldering combustion {{does not appear to}} be a significant hazard in aircraft passenger cabins, but seems to be a basis for careful selection of materials for residential environments...|$|R

40|$|Shear is {{a complex}} {{phenomenon}} and yet ever present in wheel chair <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> <b>bed</b> support surfaces. This {{is an attempt to}} define the terms and to relate the factors influencing shear and offers suggestions to minimize shear’s influence on tissue. Preamble: The terms are often used to describe the force that causes deformation and the deformation itself. The definitions given here are from an engineering perspective but specifically address the wheelchair seat cushion or bed support surface environment. Often terms for stress (force) and strain (distortion) are confused, especially when the forces come from different directions. The resulting tissue strain (distortion) may instrumental in reducing the blood and fluid flow to or from the distorted tissue. Shear is one of the items in the hierarchy of causes pressure ulcers (Taylor 31). Shear reduces the pressure at which a decubitus occurs in swine by a factor of 6 (from 290 mmHg to 45 mmHg, Dinsdale 35) and since some shear may be necessary to keep people from sliding out of their wheelchair or bed, {{it is important to understand}} the cause of shear and how it combines with pressure...|$|R

It bolts through the streets entirely invisible to Muggles and causes other objects to dodge it (instead of the other way around) for short distance-travel. For longer distances, the Knight Bus makes hundred-mile (160km) leaps, accompanied by a great bang and jolt. The interior of the bus changes depending on the time of day, having <b>seats</b> by day <b>and</b> <b>beds</b> by night. It is also highly uncomfortable, according to Ron and Harry.

5000|$|The Bencao gangmu {{entry for}} the rong 狨 {{explains}} the synonym nao 猱 signifies this monkey's rou 柔 [...] "soft; supple" [...] hair.The hair {{of the golden}} monkey is long and soft. So it is called Rong (meaning [...] "fine hair"). Nao is a character meaning [...] "soft." [...] Another explanation says that the animal {{is found in the}} western Rong region Sichuan, so it is thus named. There is a kind of long-hair dog that is also called Nao. ... The book Tan Yuan 談苑 by Yang Yi (楊億): The golden monkey is found in the deep mountains in Sichuan and Shaanxi. It looks like an ape. It has a long tail of golden color. So it is colloquially called Jinsirong 金絲狨 (meaning [...] "golden thread monkey"). It is quick at climbing trees. It loves its tail dearly. When shot by a poisonous arrow, it will bite off its own tail when poisoned. During the Song dynasty (960-1279), only officials of the administration and military of the third rank and above were allowed to use <b>seats</b> <b>and</b> <b>bedding</b> made of golden monkey hide. (tr. Luo 2003: 4126, cf. Read 1931: no. 401)This entry has two subheadings: the yuan 猨 or changbeihou 長臂猴 [...] "gibbon, Hylobates agilis" [...] and the du 獨 (below).The ape is good at climbing trees. It is found in the deep mountains in the Chuan and Guang regions. It looks like a monkey, but has very long arms. It is an animal that can practice Daoist qi (Vital Energy), so it lives a long life. Some say it has one arm stretching {{from one side to the}} other. This is not correct. Its arm bone can be made into a flute that sounds very clear and resonant. Apes come in different colors: blue-green, white, black, yellow and crimson. It is a kind and quiet animal, and likes to eat fruits. It lives in forests and can jump over a distance of several dozen chi. But when it falls and drops onto the ground, it may suffer from excessive diarrhea and then die. Treatment is the drinking of juice of Fuzi/radix aconiti lateralis/daughter root of common monkshood. Apes live in groups. The male cries a lot. It makes three cries consecutively. The cry sounds miserable and is penetrating. The book Guihai Zhi 桂海志 by Fan Chengda: There are three varieties of apes: Yellow ones with golden thread; black ones with jade faces; and black ones with black faces. Some say the pure black one is the male, and the golden thread one is the female. A male one shouts and a female does not. The book Rixun Ji 日詢記 by Wang Ji: People in the Guang region say that when an ape is born, it is black and male, When it gets old, it turns yellow and its genitals become ulcerous, and then it turns into a female. Then it mates with the black one. After another several hundred years, the yellow ape will evolve into a white one. (tr. Luo 2003: 4126, cf. Read 1931 no. 401A) ...|$|R

50|$|Masonry {{takes longer}} to heat than metal; but once warm, the heater will radiate this heat over {{a much longer}} period of time and at a much lower {{temperature}} than a metal stove would use (the metal is hot only when there is a fire burning inside the stove and for a short time thereafter). A masonry heater is warmed by fires that burn for a short time; it is mostly the heat stored by the heater's mass that heats the living space. Both in Europe <b>and</b> in America <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> even <b>beds</b> are occasionally built adjoining the masonry stove; this is possible because the heater's exterior surfaces are cool enough to touch safely. This cycle of short firings and long periods of heat-release makes a masonry heater a much more convenient option for actually heating a house with wood, than a metal wood stove. Masonry stoves can release heat from anywhere up to 36 hours after the fire has gone out (the larger the thermal mass the more heat the appliance can retain). This means that a householder might typically light a fire in the evening on returning home. In a more modern masonry heater with a glass door, this means that they can enjoy the fire during the evening. But overnight and throughout the next day when the fire is no longer alight the heater will still be warming the house, ready for the cycle to start again next evening. Compare this to a metal stove which is either often too hot or too cold (unlit) and the requirement for the owner to be present to load with logs at regular intervals and the benefits should be clear.|$|R
