25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is if we continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>is</b> heading.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{needed to}} find a vehicle to {{continue}} to contain Saddam because the CIA said {{all we have to}} do is wait six months and Saddam is going to collapse on his own volition. That vehicle is sanctions. They needed a justification; the justification was disarmament. They drafted a Chapter 7 resolution of the United Nations Security Council calling for the disarmament of Iraq and saying in Paragraph 14 that if Iraq complies, sanctions will be lifted. Within months of this resolution being passed—and the United States drafted and voted in favor of this resolution—within months, the President, George Herbert Walker Bush, and his Secretary of State, James Baker, are saying publicly, not privately, publicly that even if Iraq complies with its obligation to disarm, economic sanctions will be maintained until which time <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>is</b> removed from power.|$|E

Patrick also makes a cameo appearance as the T-1000 in Last Action Hero (1993), when he is seen walking by Schwarzenegger as he enters Los Angeles Police Department headquarters. In the same film, actor Sylvester Stallone is featured as the Terminator on a Terminator2 poster instead of Schwarzenegger. In Hot Shots!

500|$|Halfway {{through the}} school year, Ali's family moves to the more {{peaceful}} Kurdish region in Northern Iraq but after living there for several months, Ali {{says that he is}} homesick and misses the action and noise of Baghdad. Mohammad, feeling lonely, [...] "adopts" [...] a bird with a broken wing and a mouse he finds in the house. This brings him some comfort, but his mother later demands that he get rid of the mouse as she does not want [...] "vermin" [...] in the house. Mohammad's family rejoice when <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>is</b> sentenced, and feel that his later execution was justified, as to do otherwise would have made the Iraqi people look weak. Conversely, Anmar's family is upset at his execution, as they feel that the people who came into power were no better than Hussein was. Hyder's mother says that many Iraqi people were hopeful about the arrival of American forces, and that it is wrong to blame America for all of the problems in Iraq. She notes that the bloodshed has yet to stop as the Sunni continues to kill the Shiite, and vice versa. As the film continues, Hyder's family loses its income and they start to sell their furniture to earn extra money.|$|E
