40|$|Purpose: The {{continuous}} {{steel casting}} (CSC) {{technology is a}} dynamically developing method for obtaining <b>steel</b> <b>semi-finished</b> product {{in the form of}} a continuous casting slabs, blooms and billets. During the course of the CSC process, the liquid form of steel offers a possibility of introducing alloy additions to adjust the chemical composition or modify the non-metallic inclusions. The aim of the tests was to verify the degree of chemical homogenization of the steel after the addition of nickel. Design/methodology/approach: The device under examination is a wedge-shaped single-nozzle tundish of a capacity of 30 Mg. Computer simulation of the liquid steel flow and alloy addition behaviour in turbulent motion conditions was done using the Ansys-Fluent® computer program. Due to the complexity of alloy addition dissolution and dispersion in metallurgical processes, a decision was made to use the Species Model available within the Ansys-Fluent® program. Findings: The computer simulation produced a picture of the flow of liquid steel and the spread of nickel within the liquid steel volume. To illustrate the chemical homogenization process spatially and in a greater detail, the Ni diffusion process was monitored at selected measurement points situated in the tundish working space region. Research limitations/implications: Numerical model not include melting process of alloy addition.

50|$|Cold-formed steel (CFS) is {{the common}} term for {{products}} made by rolling or pressing <b>steel</b> into <b>semi-finished</b> or finished goods at relatively low temperatures (cold working). Cold-formed steel goods are created by the working of steel billet, bar, or sheet using stamping, rolling (including roll forming), or presses to deform it into a usable product. Cold-worked steel products, such as cold-rolled steel (CRS) bar stock and sheet, are commonly used {{in all areas of}} manufacturing of durable goods, such as appliances or automobiles, but the phrase cold-formed steel is most prevalently used to describe construction materials. The use of cold-formed steel construction materials has become more and more popular since its initial introduction of codified standards in 1946. In the construction industry both structural and non-structural elements are created from thin gauges of sheet steel. These building materials encompass columns, beams, joists, studs, floor decking, built-up sections and other components. Cold-formed steel construction materials differ from other steel construction materials known as hot-rolled steel (see structural steel). The manufacturing of cold-formed steel products occurs at room temperature using rolling or pressing. The strength of elements used for design is usually governed by buckling. The construction practices are more similar to timber framing using screws to assemble stud frames.|$|R

40|$|An engineering-economic {{model is}} used within a dynamic setting to {{determine}} the least cost mix of investment and import activities as the U. S. steel industry faces successively tighter controls on coke oven emissions over the next 10 years. In response to Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards proposed for 1995, U. S. steel producers would likely export their toxic pollution by importing 6 million tons of coke per year. About 4 million tons of coke oven capacity is retrofit and about 1 million tons of annual coke consumption is replaced by new iron technologies, such as Corex. The Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) standards proposed for 1998 roughly double the coke oven retirements estimated to occur under MACT. Coke imports also are substantial but are no higher than under MACT because the additional time allows the industry to invest in more coke-saving blast furnaces and in new less toxic coke-making technologies, such as the Jewell process. The LAER standards in conjunction with higher capital costs, however, force coke imports to more than 8 million tons per year and sharply increase imports of <b>semi-finished</b> <b>steel.</b> Such a situation could exacerbate existing disputes on international steel trade.

40|$|Abstract — Continuous casting is {{a process}} in which liquid steel is cooled in a {{bottomless}} mould into <b>semi-finished</b> <b>steel</b> products called billets, blooms or slabs depending on their cross section. In the process of continuous casting, two of the major problems encountered are cracks and breakouts. Breakouts usually result in temporary shutdown of the caster and huge amounts of downtime. Primary cracks which form before the solidifying strand exits the mould, are invariably linked to breakouts. Controlling primary cracks results in reduced chances of breakouts. This work aims at designing a breakout prediction neural network model. In this paper, a two-layer feed forward backpropagation neural network model is developed for predicting the existence of primary cracks that might lead to a breakout. The network obtains its inputs in form of temperature values from rows of thermocouples attached to the mould tube. Based on solidification characteristics of steel, the neural network is supplied with various inputs (of temperature values) and targets and is trained to predict the crack status in the mould. Training is performed using the Levernberg-Marquardt (trainlm) training algorithm, and the log sigmoid transfer function was used for both the hidden and output layer. The output from this neural network was a logical 1 (if a primary crack is present) and a logical 0 (if no primary crack is present). The neural network model is validated by simulating i...|$|R

40|$|Continuous casting is {{a highly}} {{efficient}} process used to produce {{most of the world}} steel production tonnage, but can cause cracks in the <b>semi-finished</b> <b>steel</b> product output. These cracks may cause problems further down the production chain, and detecting them early in the process would avoid unnecessary and costly processing of the defective goods. In order for a crack detection system to be accepted in industry, however, false detection of cracks in non-defective goods must be avoided. This is further complicated by the presence of scales; a brittle, often cracked, top layer originating from the casting process. We present an approach for an automated on-line crack detection system, based on 3 D profile data of steel slab surfaces, utilizing morphological image processing and statistical classification by logistic regression. The initial segmentation successfully extracts 80 % of the crack length present in the data, while discarding most potential pseudo-defects (non-defect surface features similar to defects). The subsequent statistical classification individually has a crack detection accuracy of over 80 % (with respect to total segmented crack length), while discarding all remaining manually identified pseudo-defects. Taking more ambiguous regions into account gives a worst-case false classification of 131 mm within the 30 600 mm long sequence of 150 mm wide regions used as validation data. The combined system successfully identifies over 70 % of the manually identified (unambiguous) crack length, while missing only a few crack regions containing short crack segments. The results provide proof-of-concept for a fully automated crack detection system based on the presented method.

50|$|The Duluth Works {{primary purpose}} was to build steel for the {{expanding}} Midwest prairies and far west plains. When first constructed, it was originally intended to build rails for the expanding railroads, {{but by the time}} the mill was completed in 1915, the railroads had already reached their peak of construction and it was felt that those needs could best be handled from the Chicago area. So after completing its rail mill, it was converted into billet finishing facilities. In 1922, after going over what products would best serve the plant's existence, U.S. Steel decided to expand its Morgan Park operation and built a new wire, rod, Nail mill, and fence post fabrication facility. These products, it was felt, best suited Duluth's capabilities for integrated steel production. Yet, even after the expansion of these facilities, the Duluth Works only consumed 20% of its own steel production for its finished products. The rest of its <b>semi-finished</b> <b>steel</b> was shipped to other facilities for finishing. Even more disheartening, its proposed 12 state market area and areas of Canada were sparsely populated and able to be supplied with products from other mills. Despite these early predictions, Minnesota Steel remained at work producing steel products right up to its very end. Some of its products were only produced within the U.S. Steel Corporation at the Duluth Works facility. These included steel wool, certain nails, fence and fence post and a new product introduced in 1954, welded wire fabric, primarily for use with concrete to produce more sturdy road construction. Some of this material was used to produce missile silos for the U.S. Air Forces' Strategic Air Command throughout the Midwest.|$|R
40|$|The {{scarfing}} processing {{experiment was}} carried out for a steel slab moving at a constant speed with the scarfing torch fixed. The temperature histories inside the slab were recorded by two sets of thermocouples in different depths. A two-step computational model of heat transfer in scarfing processing has been developed in FLUENT. The model features in detail heat conduction from both the hot slag coating and the scarfing reaction to the steel slab surface, and it solves for steady state heat advection in the Step- 1 model followed by the Step- 2 model of transient heat transfer calculation. The combination of these two steps is able to give the complete prediction of a temperature history of 122. 2 sec. The temperature predictions agree well with the experimental measurements. The high temperature region (1100 oC ~ 1500 oC) {{is found to be}} mainly located in a depth of 0. 5 mm near the slab surface. The fraction of heat conducted from the hot slag coating into the slab is 5. 4 % while that from the scarfing reaction is 10. 3 %.

Steel slabs produced from continuous casting often exhibit surface defects, including inclusions, pits and cracks, such as shown in Fig. 1.

This profile will be set by steel plant engineers, in order to minimize the formation of cracks and other defects. The system will be calibrated using thermocouple and optical temperature sensors, tested and implemented at an operating U. S. thin slab caster. This project is important because 96 % of the 100 million tons of steel produced in the U. S. each year is continuously cast, and the fraction produced by the new high-speed thin-slab casting process grows every year. This process experiences many defects caused by undesired temperature variations during spray cooling, which are unavoidable using current control systems. Conventional feedback control cannot be used because temperature sensors are too inaccurate and expensive. The model-based predictive control system proposed here must overcome many challenges, including the high speed of the process and increased relative importance of mold solidification. In the first year of this large project, progress has been on several different subprojects. A finite difference model, CON 1 D, has been optimized to run in an online environment under fully transient conditions. It has been integrated into a control system and found to outperform the existing control system used at the steel plant. It is currently being tested. Spray cooling experiments have begun, new control algorithms have been developed, and new insights into defect formation have been found.

40|$|The {{continuous}} casting technique {{in the last}} four decades has been large used for to production of <b>semi-finished</b> <b>steel.</b> The heat transfer is major mechanism and it occurs in various steps during the {{continuous casting}}. The quality of steel {{is directly related to the}} way the heat transfer occur because the thermal variations produce mechanical loads as well as contact forces which are generated through the rollers and shake of the mold. Such factors may cause defects such as fractures or cracks in the final product if the resulting stresses and strains exceed critical values.
