5|$|Jif is {{packaged}} in a <b>squeezable</b> container {{shaped like a}} lemon, and in bottles. Development of the plastic container began in the 1950s, {{and was one of}} the original blow moulded containers used for food applications. Jif brand lemon juice was established in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish may be {{purchased}} pre-soaked into a hard sponge, {{which can be}} used to buff leather without needing to apply any additional polish to either the leather or the sponge. This is usually known as an applicator. A number of companies that manufacture shoe care products also sell a liquid shoe polish in a <b>squeezable</b> plastic bottle, with a small sponge applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish usually has a very low wax content.|$|E
5|$|Bill Pugh, {{the chief}} {{plastics}} designer at Cascelloid, based in Leicester, and former Royal Air Force pilot, created {{a prototype of}} the blown lemon-shaped plastic shaped container based upon Hack's idea sometime in the 1950s, {{as well as other}} types of blown containers. Pugh's experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This plastic lemon product was then used for Hax lemon juice. Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand <b>squeezable</b> plastic lemon containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian lemon juice. Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the juice was unfiltered, had no water added to it, and contained a preservative to prevent spoilage. Retailers could purchase the product in packs of six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax juice and the plastic lemon design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax lemon juice dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine pencils and Hax brand aspirin.|$|E
40|$|The author {{discusses}} {{research in}} music cognition and education indicating that novices and untrained students perceive and learn music in a fundamentally different manner than do expert musicians. Based on these studies, he suggests implementing high-level musical percepts and constructionist learning schemes in new expressive musical instruments that would provide thoughtful and joyful musical activities for novices and experts alike. The author describes several instruments [...] -the Musical Playpen, Fireflies and <b>Squeezables</b> [...] -that he has developed {{in an effort to}} provide novices with access to rich and meaningful musical experiences and recounts observations and interviews of subjects playing these instruments...|$|R
5000|$|Weinberg has {{developed}} a number of novel musical instruments for novices, such as the Beatbugs, and the <b>Squeezables</b> [...] before conceiving the field of Robotic Musicianship. In 2005, he created the world first improvising robot, Haile, which can listen to human musicians, improvise and play along {{using a variety of}} musical algorithms. His next inventions were Shimon an improvising robotic marimba player that can improvise like jazz masters, [...] and Travis (also known as Shimi), a smart-phone enabled robotic musical companion that is designed to enhance listeners musical experiences. Shimi is currently being commercialized by Tovbot Inc.|$|R

25|$|Plastic {{products}} are printed with numbers 1–7 {{depending on the}} type of resin. Type 1 (polyethylene terephthalate) is commonly found in soft drink and water bottles. Type 2 (high-density polyethylene) is found in most hard plastics such as milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles, and some dishware. Type 3 (polyvinyl chloride) includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains, hula hoops, credit cards, wire jacketing, medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 (low-density polyethylene) is found in shopping bags, <b>squeezable</b> bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet. Type 5 is polypropylene and makes up syrup bottles, straws, Tupperware, and some automotive parts. Type 6 is polystyrene and makes up meat trays, egg cartons, clamshell containers, and compact disc cases. Type 7 includes all other plastics such as bulletproof materials, 3- and 5-gallon water bottles, and sunglasses. Having a recycling code or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the material is. Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{stringed}} rackets {{is shared}} with tennis, which {{dates from the}} late sixteenth century, though is more directly descended from the game of rackets from England.

2500|$|The [...] "upside-down" [...] <b>squeezable</b> plastic bottle, {{consisting}} of an opaque red bottle {{with a wide}} white cap located at the bottom, was introduced as a food service product in 2002. It allows ketchup to be dispensed more easily than was possible with the glass bottle, and permits the use of more of the ketchup in the bottle, as the contents will settle {{on top of the}} dispensing valve. The [...] "upside-down" [...] bottle is intended to be non-refillable. A similar bottle has been introduced in several different sizes at the retail/grocery level, but without the opaque red coloring.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the high}} {{operating}} altitude and the cockpit's partial pressurization, equivalent to [...] pressure altitude, the pilot wears a partially pressurized space suit, which delivers the pilot's oxygen supply and provides emergency protection in case cabin pressure is lost. While pilots can drink water and eat various liquid foods in <b>squeezable</b> containers through a self-sealing hole in the face mask, they typically lose up to [...] of weight on an eight-hour mission. Most pilots chose to not take with them the suicide pill offered before missions. If put in the mouth and bitten, the [...] "L-pill"—containing liquid potassium cyanide—would cause death in 10–15 seconds. After a pilot almost accidentally ingested an L-pill instead of candy during a December 1956 flight, the suicide pills were put into boxes to avoid confusion. When in 1960 the CIA realized that a pill breaking inside the cockpit would kill the pilot, it destroyed the L-pills, and as a replacement its Technical Services Division developed a needle poisoned with a powerful shellfish toxin and hidden in a silver dollar. Only one was made because, as the agency decided, if any pilot needed to use it the program would probably be canceled. Like the suicide pill, not all pilots carried the coin, and Knutson {{did not know of}} any that intended to commit suicide; he carried it as an escape tool.|$|E
6000|$|The {{engineer}} judged {{from the}} promptitude of the reply that the Cornish landlord {{must still be}} well <b>squeezable.</b> He shook his head gain. [...] "No, no; not enough," [...] he answered short. [...] "Not enough--by a long way." ...|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{more was}} said about money, {{and very little}} on any other subject. On what other subject could a {{pleasant}} votary of pleasure, such as Sir Lionel, wish to hold conversation with a worn-out old miser from the city? He had regarded his brother as a very full sponge, from which living water might probably be squeezed. But the sponge, it seemed, was no longer <b>squeezable</b> by him in any way. So he left Hadley {{as quickly as he}} could, and betook himself to Littlebath with a somewhat saddened heart. He consoled himself, however, by reflecting that an old man's whims are seldom very enduring, and that George might yet become a participator in the huge prize; if not on his own account, at least on that of his wife.|$|E
6000|$|I duly {{received}} and much pondered your second letter, charming and vivid, from Annisquam; the one, I mean, in reply to mine dispatched immediately on {{the receipt of}} your first. If I haven't since its arrival written to you, this is because, precisely, I needed to work out my question somewhat further first. My impulse was immediately to say that I wanted to do my little stuff at any rate, and was willing therefore to take any attendant risk, however, measured as the little stuff would be, at the worst, a thing I should see my way to dispose of in another manner. But {{the problem of the}} little stuff itself intrinsically worried me--to the extent, I mean, of my not feeling thoroughly sure I might make of it what I wanted and above all what your conditions of space required. The thing was therefore to try and satisfy myself practically--by threshing out my subject to as near an approach to certainty as possible. This I have been doing with much intensity--but with the result, I am sorry to say, of being still in the air. Let the present accordingly pass for a provisional communication--not to leave your last encompassed with too much silence. Lending myself as much as possible to your suggestion of a little [...] "tale of terror" [...] that should be also international, I took straight up again the idea I spoke to you of having already, some months ago, tackled and, for various reasons, laid aside. I have been attacking it again with intensity and {{on the basis of a}} simplification that would make it easier, and have done for it, thus, 110 pages of type. The upshot of this, alas, however, is that though this second start is, if I--or if you--like, magnificent, it seriously confronts me with the element of length; showing me, I fear, but too vividly, that, do what I will for compression, I shall not be able to squeeze my subject into 50,000 words. It will make, even if it doesn't, for difficulty, still beat me, 70,000 or 80,000--dreadful to say; and that faces me as an excessive addition to the ingredient of [...] "risk" [...] we speak of. On the other hand I am not sure that I can hope to substitute for this particular affair another affair of [...] "terror" [...] which will be expressible in the 50,000; and that for an especial reason. This reason is that, above all when one has done the thing, already, as I have rather repeatedly, it is not easy to concoct a [...] "ghost" [...] of any freshness. The want of ease is extremely marked, moreover, if the thing is to be done on a certain scale of length. One might still toss off a spook or two more if it were a question only of the [...] "short-story" [...] dimension; but prolongation and extension constitute a strain which the merely apparitional--discounted, also, as by my past dealings with it--doesn't do enough to mitigate. The beauty of this notion of [...] "The Sense of the Past," [...] of which I have again, as I tell you, been astride, is precisely that it involves without the stale effect of the mere bloated bugaboo, the presentation, for folk both in and out of the book, of such a sense of gruesome malaise as can only--success being assumed--make the fortune, in the [...] "literary world," [...] of every one concerned. I haven't, in it, really (that is save in one very partial preliminary and expository connection,) to make anything, or anybody, [...] "appear" [...] to anyone: what the case involves is, awfully interestingly and thrillingly, that the [...] "central figure," [...] the subject of the experience, has the terror of a particular ground for feeling and fearing that he himself is, or may at any moment become, a producer, an object, of this (for you and me) state of panic on the part of others. He lives in an air of malaise as to the malaise he may, woefully, more or less fatally, find himself creating--and that, roughly speaking, is the essence of what I have seen. It is less gross, much less banal and exploded, than the dear old familiar bugaboo; produces, I think, for the reader, an almost equal funk--or at any rate an equal suspense and unrest; and carries with it, as I have [...] "fixed" [...] it, a more truly curious and interesting drama--especially a more human one. But, as I say, there are the necessities of space, as to which I have a dread of deluding myself only to find that by trying to blink them I shall be grossly [...] "sold," [...] or by giving way to them shall positively spoil my form for your purpose. The hitch is that the thing involves a devil of a sort of prologue or preliminary action--interesting itself and indispensable for lucidity--which impinges too considerably (for brevity) on the core of the subject. My one chance is yet, I admit, to try to attack the same (the subject) from still another quarter, at still another angle, that I make out as a possible one and which may keep it <b>squeezable</b> and short. If this experiment fails, I fear I shall have to [...] "chuck" [...] the supernatural and the high fantastic. I have just finished, as it happens, a fine flight (of eighty thousand words) into the high fantastic, which has rather depleted me, or at any rate affected me as discharging my obligations in that quarter. But I believe I mentioned to you in my last [...] "The Sacred Fount"--this has been [...] "sold" [...] to Methuen here, and by this time, probably, to somebody else in the U.S.--but, alas, not to be serialized (as to which indeed it is inapt)--as to the title of which kindly preserve silence. The vraie vérité, the fundamental truth lurking behind all the rest, is furthermore, no doubt, that preoccupied with half a dozen things of the altogether human order now fermenting in my brain, I don't care for [...] "terror" [...] (terror, that is, without [...] "pity") so much as I otherwise might. This would seem to make it simple for me to say to you: [...] "Hang it, if I can't pull off my Monster on any terms, I'll just do for you a neat little human--and not the less international--fifty-thousander consummately addressed to your more cheerful department; do for you, in other words, an admirable short novel of manners, thrilling too in its degree, but definitely ignoring the bugaboo." [...] Well, this I don't positively despair of still sufficiently overtaking myself to be able to think of. That card one has always, thank God, up one's sleeve, and the production of it is only a question of a little shake of the arm. At the same time, here, to be frank--and above all, you will say, in this communication, to be interminable--that alternative is just a trifle compromised by the fact that I've two or three things begun ever so beautifully in such a key (and only awaiting the rush of the avid bidder!)--each affecting me with its particular obsession, and one, the most started, affecting me with the greatest obsession, for the time (till I can do it, work it off, get it out of the way and fall with still-accumulated intensity upon the others,) of all. But alas, if I don't say, bang off, that this is then the thing I will risk for you, it is because [...] "this," [...] like its companions, isn't, any way I can fix it, workable as a fifty-thousander. The scheme to which I am now alluding is lovely--human, dramatic, international, exquisitely [...] "pure," [...] exquisitely everything; only absolutely condemned, from the germ up, to be workable in not less than 100,000 words. If 100,000 were what you had asked me for, I would fall back upon it ("terror" [...] failing) like a flash; and even send you, without delay, a detailed Scenario of it that I drew up a year ago; beginning then--a year ago--to do the thing--immediately afterwards; and then again pausing for reasons extraneous and economic.... It really constitutes, at any rate, the work I intimately want actually to be getting on with; and--if you are not overdone with the profusion of my confidence--I dare say I best put my case by declaring that, if you don't in another month or two hear from me either as a Terrorist or as a Cheerful Internationalist, it will be that intrinsic difficulties will in each case have mastered me; the difficulty in the one having been to keep my Terror down by any ingenuity to the 50,000; and the difficulty in the other form of Cheer than the above-mentioned obsessive hundred-thousander. I only wish you wanted him. But I have now in all probability a decent outlet for him.|$|E
