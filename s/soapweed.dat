25|$|The diverse {{terrain and}} soils of the Milk River Natural Area lend {{themselves}} to a large variety of plant communities. In the protected area, aside from non-vegetated badlands, the primary vegetation cover is dry mixed grassland, with the dominant species being needle-and-thread (Hesperostipa comate) and blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis). Other grassland species associated with the area include northern wheat grass (Agropyron dasystachyum), western wheat grass (Pascopyrum smithii), prairie june grass (Koeleria macrantha), sandberg bluegrass (Poa sandbergii) and various sedge species. The flood plains surrounding the river contain large stands of plains cottonwood (Populus deltoides) and sagebrush flats. Moss phlox (Phlox subulata) and prairie selaginella (Selaginella densa) are common forbs. Complex but often sparse vegetation communities adjusted to harsh conditions exist at the border between coulees and grasslands and feature species such as mosses, lichens, black greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus), rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus), long-leaved sage, sagebrush (Artemisia frigida), and povertyweed (Monolepis nuttalliana). The endangered in Alberta <b>soapweed</b> (Yucca glauca), mutually dependent upon the yucca moth (Tegeticula yuccasella), also occurs in the area.|$|E

The earth was gravelly, with dark patches of heavy silt, almost like cinders; and round, black rocks, flinty and glassy, cracked away from the hoofs of the mustangs. There was a level bench a mile wide, then a ravine, and then an ascent, and after that, rounded ridge and ravine, one after the other, like huge swells of a monstrous sea. Indian paint-brush vied in its scarlet hue with the deep magenta of cactus. There was no sage. <b>Soapweed</b> and meager grass and a bunch of cactus here and there lent the green to that barren; and it was green only at a distance. Nas Ta Bega kept on a steady, even trot.

50|$|Nesting cover: In March or April winter coveys {{spread out}} into areas with less cover. This use of areas with less cover coincides with a {{seasonal}} {{decrease in the}} number of raptors in the same area. Scaled quail nests are constructed under tufts of grasses, and are sheltered by sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), mesquite, catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii), cactus, or yucca; under dead Russian-thistle (Salsola kali), mixed forbs, or <b>soapweed</b> yucca; or sheltered in old machinery or other human-made debris. In Oklahoma, 66% of nests were in one of four situations: (1) dead Russian-thistle, (2) machinery and junk, (3) mixed forbs, and (4) <b>soapweed</b> yucca. In New Mexico, ordination of breeding birds and vegetative microhabitats indicated that scaled quail were associated with increased levels of patchiness and increased cover of mesquite and cactus.|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{practices}} in the Great Plains of North America {{are now in a}} period of adjustment from a traditional agriculture initiated by pioneer farmers to a grazing economy based upon potentialities of climate and soil. The attainment of a proper system of land use has been retarded in many localities by the lack of definite information concerning the vegetation and its indicator significance. In this study of the vegetation of Cherry County, Nebraska, the interrelations between the plants and their environments are discussed, the dominant species are described, and changes in grasslands caused by seasons, grazing, and climatic cycles are explained. Cherry County, which is located in north-central Nebraska, extends from 100 ° 10 ′ to 102 ° 2 ′ west longitude and from 42 ° 7 ′ to 43 ° north latitude, distances of 96 and 63 miles, respectively. It is the largest county in Nebraska and includes an area of 6, 048 square miles. More than 90 percent of this area lies in the sand-hill region. The remainder (the hardlands) consists of fine sandy loam soils, the main body of which is north of the Niobrara River and northeast of Minnechaduza Creek. A study of the vegetation of the sand hills of Nebraska was first made by Pool (1914). Reviews of pioneer work on the taxonomy of various species may be found in his paper. Since then few studies have been made. Weaver (1920) described root systems of certain sand-hill plants, and Keim and Frolik (1932) studied the introduction of exotic legumes and grasses into wet meadows and recorded the effects upon productivity. Ramaley (1939) made a study of the flora of the sand hills of northeastern Colorado and compared it with the sand-hill flora of Nebraska. According to information obtained from pioneers who are yet living, the dunes were not as well vegetated {{in the early years of}} settlement as they are at present. Blowouts were more common, and pioneer vegetation was more prevalent. An early resident stated that sand-hill bluestem (Andropogon hallii Hack.) was much more common than it is today. Little bluestem (Andropogon scoparius Michx.) was once dominant and led Pool (1913) to describe a “bunch-grass association. ” Early pictures verify Pool’s conclusions (Anderson 2 ̆ 6 Walker 1920) and also indicate that blowout grass (Redfieldia flexuosa (Thurb.) Vasey) and weedy plants like <b>soapweed</b> (Yucca glaiica Nutt.) were once very common. Changes in vegetation of the sand hills since their settlement by white men have accompanied the control of fires, and differences in land use and intensity of grazing. Before the development of ranching, prairie fires occurred throughout the region at varying intervals. These fires spread rapidly and generated intense heat wherever sufficient debris had accumulated. Buds were killed, even in the centers of the bunches of grass, and roots were burned. Severe wind erosion followed denudation, and most dunes were permanently capped with a blowout. After each fire pioneer grasses and forbs began a new succession of plants. Only after several years was enough litter again accumulated to feed new fires. Since the beginning of the present century grazing has checked this accumulation, and therefore fires have been under control. Dunes are now held in place and large blowouts are rare. Variation in composition of vegetation is now caused by grazing and local environments. Areas of vegetation on government preserves or on private ranges which have been protected from both fire and grazing for many years indicate the potentialities of development of vegetation in the several environments. Modifications of composition regularly accompany shifts from one phase of the climatic cycle to another. The decrease of little bluestem during the recent dry years is a striking example...|$|E
