2500|$|The Su-57 has a {{glass cockpit}} with two [...] main multi-functional LCD {{displays}} {{similar to the}} arrangement of the Su-35S. Positioned around the cockpit are three <b>smaller</b> <b>control</b> panel displays. The cockpit has a wide-angle (30° by 22°) head-up display (HUD), and Moscow-based Geofizika-NV provides a new NSTsI-V helmet-mounted sight and display for the ZSh-10 helmet. Primary controls are the joystick and a pair of throttles. The aircraft uses a two-piece canopy, with the aft section sliding forward and locking into place. The canopy is treated with special coatings to increase the aircraft's stealth.|$|E

50|$|Industrial {{control system}} (ICS) {{is a general}} term that {{encompasses}} several types of control systems and associated instrumentation used in industrial production technology, including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and other <b>smaller</b> <b>control</b> system configurations such as programmable logic controllers (PLC) often found in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures.|$|E
50|$|TCP {{transparent}} proxies involve {{breaking up}} of long end-to-end control loops to several <b>smaller</b> <b>control</b> loops by intercepting and relaying TCP connections within the network.

50|$|A {{less stable}} {{aircraft}} requires <b>smaller</b> <b>control</b> deflections to initiate maneuvering; consequently drag and control surface imposed stresses {{will be reduced}} and aircraft responsiveness will be enhanced. Since these characteristics will typically make control by the pilot difficult or impossible, an artificial stability will typically be imposed using computers, servos, and sensors as parts of a fly by wire control system.|$|E

In total, the command module panels included 24 instruments, 566 switches, 40 event indicators, and 71 lights.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{scaled-down}} {{version of}} the Roland MC-505. It has the same tone generator, but a much <b>smaller</b> <b>control</b> surface. It does, however, have several features that make it an ideal clock source for musicians wanting to do beatmatching. These include a large, very granular tempo slider similar to the sliders found on a modern phonograph and 'push' and 'hold' buttons that permit temporarily slowing down or speeding up the beat clock.|$|E

50|$|Alcohol septal {{ablation}} is {{a technique}} designed to reduce the obstruction to blood being ejected from the heart.

50|$|Construction {{on the low}} {{pressure}} and machinery buildings began in 1914. The project included several manufacturing bodies: two longitudinal naves covered on both sides, each one to accommodate six Babcock & Wilcox {{low pressure}} boilers; one machinery room with a capacity for two German AEG 8MW turbo-alternators; {{as well as a}} <b>smaller</b> <b>control</b> and substation building. Construction began from north to south and east to west, and aside from the above, the possibility of later expanding on the southern side {{to the edge of the}} Tagus river was also immediately plotted.|$|E

50|$|The YJ-82 {{is almost}} {{identical}} to the YJ-8 in appearance apart from a slightly longer fuselage and an air inlet for the turbojet engine. The missile has a slim body and ovoid nose. There are four front delta wings, four <b>smaller</b> <b>control</b> surfaces, and four large tail stabilising wings. The tail wings are mounted on the rocket booster and are lost when the booster detaches from the missile body. The air inlet is located between the main fins under the missile body. The front and tail wings are folded when the missile is in the launcher.|$|E
5000|$|Tracking. State {{tracking}} {{is driving}} a solution [...] to the prespecified function of time [...] Similarly, output tracking {{is driving the}} output [...] to the desired output function [...] The problem is more complex if the desired equilibrium [...] or trajectory [...] is unstable {{in the absence of}} control action. For example, a typical problem of chaos control can be formulated as tracking an unstable periodic solution (orbit). The key feature of the control problems for physical systems is that the goal should be achieved by means of sufficiently <b>small</b> <b>control.</b> A limit case is stabilization of a system by an arbitrarily <b>small</b> <b>control.</b> The solvability of this task is not obvious if the trajectory [...] is unstable, for example in the case of chaotic systems.

5000|$|After the LAS is jettisoned, the Orion Crew and Service Modules (CSM) will {{separate}} {{as a whole}} {{from the}} SLS and either use its large AJ-10 engine or <b>smaller</b> <b>control</b> engines to maneuver from the rocket. Similar to a Space Shuttle Trans-Atlantic (TAL) abort profile, the Orion will use the AJ-10 engine to propel the spacecraft to a desired separation point, in which then the Orion CM would land in either western Spain or Morocco on [...] "due east" [...] (i.e., lunar) flights, or in Ireland or the United Kingdom on ISS-bound flights. A splashdown in the eastern Atlantic Ocean would only be a contingency.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, Year Two {{revealed}} that an underground complex had been constructed and expanded upon {{between the two}} series and {{that the majority of}} Alpha's command, operations and living centres had been relocated there. The vulnerable Main Mission had been abandoned in favour of the safer underground Command Centre, a <b>smaller</b> <b>control</b> room with many of the same features of Main Mission. The Medical Section once occupied an entire building on the Moon's surface and included several large wards, trauma, casualty and diagnostic units, intensive care wards and operating theatres. Underground, it was reduced to a few rooms, the main Medical Centre acting as a combination patient ward, examination room and surgery all in one. Living quarters were now one small room which did not even appear to have a private bath.|$|E
5000|$|KD2 is a KD1 is a Chinese UAV {{employed}} missile {{developed from}} KD1, {{and it made}} its public debut as a weapon system of Sky Eagle HW-600 (also known as WJ-600) UCAV developed by the 3rd Academy of China Aerospace Science & Industry Corporation (中国航天科工三院), {{which is also the}} developer of C-701 anti-ship missile. KD2 appears to be a miniature version of C-701, with identical aerodynamic layout. [...] Not only the numbers of control surfaces are the same for both, and so are the arrangements: the larger trapezoid shaped control surfaces are located in the middle section, while the much <b>smaller</b> <b>control</b> surfaces are located in the tail. However, the control surfaces at the tail are in different shapes for KD2, which is rectangular, while that of C-701 is trapezoid shaped. As with C-701, KD2 also adopts rocket engine for propulsion.|$|E
