50|$|The <b>small</b> <b>Lifou</b> <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops minutus), {{also known}} as the sulphur white-eye, is a species of bird in the family Zosteropidae. It is endemic to the island of Lifou in New Caledonia.|$|E
50|$|The green-backed white-eye was {{described}} by George Robert Gray in 1858 from a specimen collected in Nu. The relationships between this species and other white-eyes are uncertain, but it may form a superspecies with the <b>small</b> <b>Lifou</b> <b>white-eye,</b> also from New Caledonia, the Fiji white-eye and the yellow-fronted white-eye (from Vanuatu). This speculative proposal {{is based upon the}} shared yellow underparts and their living in the same general region.|$|E
50|$|The green-backed white-eye is {{endemic to}} the islands of New Caledonia, where it is found on Grande Terre, the main island, the smaller L'Île-des-Pins, as well as Maré in the Loyalty Islands. It is {{replaced}} on <b>Lifou</b> by the <b>small</b> and large <b>Lifou</b> <b>white-eyes.</b> It is primarily a bird of primary rainforest, from sea level up, although it becomes rare above 1000 m. It will also enter native gardens and open glades, {{as well as more}} open areas opportunistically in order to reach ripening fruit and berries. In the more open brush and woodland habitats it is generally replaced by the related silvereye.|$|R

40|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} on Tiga {{provide the}} first vouchered herpetological records for this <b>small</b> island between <b>Lifou</b> and Maré in the Loyalty Islands. Eighty-three skeletal elements from four sites yielded material assignable to skinks (Emoia loyaltiensis, Lioscincus nigrofasciolatus), geckos (Bavayia crass i-collis, B. sp., Gehyra georgpotthasti, Nactus pelagicus), and a boid snake (Candoia bihroni) all known from {{elsewhere in the}} Loyalties, as well as undetermined material consistent with these and other Loyalties lizards. Diagnostic features of geckos versus skinks for elements commonly recovered from archaeological sites and from owl pellets are discussed. Gehyra georgpotthasti has a limited distribution in the Loyalties and its occurrence on Tiga clarifies its range. The boid snake is the only reptile {{likely to have been}} harvested by human inhabitants of Tiga. The presence of gekkonid geckos in pre-European times is confirmed and contrasts with the situation of Grande Terre fossil sites, where only diplodactylid geckos have been recovered. Although it is anticipated that all species recovered from archaeological sites are still present on the island, a modern herpetofaunal survey is needed...|$|R
