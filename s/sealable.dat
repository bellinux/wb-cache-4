25|$|According to Lawrence, {{following}} earlier alleged {{threats from}} Chan, on 5 April 2005 Sukumaran met with Si Yi Chen, Martin Stephens and Lawrence at a Sydney hotel where police allege drug smuggling {{tools such as}} <b>sealable</b> plastic bags, medical tape, elastic waist bands and skin tight bike shorts were stuffed into the bags of Stephens and Lawrence. Lawrence claimed she was given cash; whilst Stephens claimed that his life was threatened. The following day, Sukumaran allegedly provided another group with cash for airflight tickets.|$|E
25|$|Container-based {{sanitation}} (CBS) {{refers to}} a sanitation system where human excreta is collected in <b>sealable,</b> removable containers (or cartridges) that are transported to treatment facilities. Container-based sanitation is usually provided as a service involving provision of certain types of portable toilets, and collection of excreta at a cost borne by the users. With suitable development, support and functioning partnerships, CBS {{can be used to}} provide low-income urban populations with safe collection, transport and treatment of excrement at a lower cost than installing and maintaining sewers. In most cases, CBS is based on the use of urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E
25|$|Self-locking and <b>sealable</b> sharps {{containers}} {{are made}} of plastic so that the sharps can not easily penetrate through the sides. Such units are designed so that the whole container can be disposed of with other biohazardous waste. Single use sharps containers of various sizes are sold throughout the world. Large medical facilities may have their own 'mini' autoclave in which these sharps containers are disposed of with other medical wastes. This minimizes the distance the containers have to travel {{and the number of}} people to come in contact with the sharps waste. Smaller clinics or offices without such facilities are required by federal regulations to hire the services of a company that specializes in transporting and properly disposing of the hazardous wastes.|$|E
25|$|According to Lawrence, again under Chan's instructions, Lawrence {{departed}} Australia on 6 April 2005. The day before, Lawrence, Stephens and Si Yi Chen {{met with}} Sukumaran where police allege drug smuggling {{tools such as}} <b>sealable</b> plastic bags, medical tape, elastic waist bands and skin tight bike shorts were stuffed into the bags of Lawrence and Stephens. Lawrence claims she was given cash; whilst Stephens claims that his life was threatened. Media reports claim that police records show that Lawrence was in daily contact with Chan, whilst in Bali, until 13 April, when Chan changed his mobile phone number. On the same day, he instructed Lawrence {{and other members of}} the Bali Nine to change hotels. The original planned departure date of 14 April from Bali was delayed as Chan suspected Australian and Indonesian police were aware of his plans.|$|E
25|$|According {{to media}} reports {{based on the}} {{testimony}} of Renae Lawrence, acting under the instructions of Andrew Chan, Stephens and Lawrence departed Australia on 6 April 2005. The day before, Stephens, Lawrence, and Si Yi Chen met with Myuran Sukumaran where police allege drug smuggling tools such as <b>sealable</b> plastic bags, medical tape, elastic waist bands and skin tight bike shorts were stuffed into the bags of Stephens and Lawrence. Lawrence claimed she was given cash; whilst Stephens claimed that his life was threatened. Media reports claim that police records show that whilst in Bali, Lawrence was in daily contact with Chan until 13 April, when Chan changed his mobile phone number. On the same day, he instructed Stephens and Lawrence, staying at the Kuta Laguna, to change hotels. Together with Chen and Norman, Stephens and Lawrence checked into the Adhi Dharma hotel on 14 April. Indonesian police were in an adjacent room in the same hotel. Nguyen arrived on 16 April, and booked into the same hotel. The original planned departure date of 14 April from Bali was delayed as Chan suspected Australian and Indonesian police were aware of his plans.|$|E
25|$|A {{vacuum tube}} {{consists}} {{of two or more}} electrodes in a vacuum inside an airtight enclosure. Most tubes have glass envelopes with a glass-to-metal seal based on kovar <b>sealable</b> borosilicate glasses, though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used. The electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via an airtight seal. Most vacuum tubes have a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater burning out or other failure modes, so they are made as replaceable units; the electrode leads connect to pins on the tube's base which plug into a tube socket. Tubes were a frequent cause of failure in electronic equipment, and consumers were expected to be able to replace tubes themselves. In addition to the base terminals, some tubes had an electrode terminating at a top cap. The principal reason for doing this was to avoid leakage resistance through the tube base, particularly for the high impedance grid input. The bases were commonly made with phenolic insulation which performs poorly as an insulator in humid conditions. Other reasons for using a top cap include improving stability by reducing grid-to-anode capacitance, improved high-frequency performance, keeping a very high plate voltage away from lower voltages, and accommodating one more electrode than allowed by the base. There was even an occasional design that had two top cap connections.|$|E

They are used in small aircraft, and for extended stakeouts, such as in a hunting blind or a wildlife observation station.|$|E
50|$|A wet palette is a <b>sealable</b> {{container}} {{with a layer}} of absorbent material (such as tissue paper or sponge) that can be soaked with water and a semi-permeable membrane (such as parchment, greaseproof paper or baking paper (silicone paper)) over that. The paint sits on the membrane and is kept wet by osmosis. The main purpose of the wet palette is to keep acrylic paint, whose drying is unreversable, workable. Wet palettes are easily made, but can be bought.|$|E
50|$|Container-based {{sanitation}} (CBS) (or cartridge-based sanitation) {{refers to}} a sanitation system where human excreta is collected in <b>sealable,</b> removable containers (also called cartridges) that are transported to treatment facilities. Container-based sanitation is usually provided as a service involving provision of toilets, usually dry portable toilets, and collection of excreta at a cost borne by the users. The system incorporates measures to isolate excreta from human contact throughout the sanitation chain (i.e. during containment, emptying, transportation, treatment and disposal or reuse of excreta).|$|E
50|$|A {{nanomaterial}} {{spill kit}} should be assembled prior {{to an emergency}} and should include barricade tape, nitrile or other chemically impervious gloves, an elastomeric full-facepiece respirator with P100 or N100 filters (fitted appropriately to the responder), adsorbent materials such as spill mats, disposable wipes, <b>sealable</b> plastic bags, walk-off sticky mats, a spray bottle with deionized water or another appropriate liquid to wet dry powders, and a HEPA-filtered vacuum. Compressed air, dry sweeping, and vacuums without a HEPA filter should never be used to clear dust.|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} making maple liqueur is simple. Equal parts rye whiskey and maple syrup are {{combined}} in a <b>sealable</b> mason jar, mixed thoroughly and then left {{to sit in the}} refrigerator for at least two weeks. Other spices and ingredients can be added to give different flavors to the liqueur, such as glycerin, honey, or brown sugar. As is with standard aging processes, generally, the longer the liqueur is left to age, the better the final product. After this, the liqueur is ready to be consumed.|$|E
50|$|False positives and {{contamination}} by subsequent handling or nearby objects (e.g. {{mixing of}} blood from victim and attacker), for example, are problems {{owing to the}} presence of many common substances and the necessity of human involvement in the collection of trace evidence. Both can occur with DNA traces and fingerprints. Partial fingerprints are even more vulnerable to false positives. Samples from accidents or crimes should therefore be protected as much as possible by enclosure in a <b>sealable</b> container as soon as possible, after an incident is under investigation.|$|E
50|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{can also}} include incubation experiments, in which sediment samples obtained from natural environments are enclosed in <b>sealable</b> containers with varied concentrations reverse weathering reactants (biogenic silica {{in the form}} of diatoms, cations, metals, etc.).Using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) also provides concentration and isotopic information for cation and silica concentrations in pore water and digested sediment samples. Utilization of a multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) is also used as a means of obtaining isotopic data of metals and silica in solution.|$|E
50|$|A palette is {{used for}} mixing and {{thinning}} paints before application. Non-porous materials, such as a plain ceramic tile, avoid sucking the solvent out of the paint. A wet palette is especially useful with acrylics that dry quickly on a dry palette.

50|$|Nearline {{tape and}} optical storage has the {{advantage}} of relatively longer lifespans compared to spinning hard drives, simply due to the storage media being idle and usually stored in protected dust-free enclosures when not in use. In a robotic tape loading system, the tape drive used for accessing data experiences the most wear and may need occasional replacement, but the tapes themselves can last for years to decades. If there are <b>sealable</b> access doors between the access mechanism and the media, it is possible for the idle media storage enclosure to survive fire, floods, lightning strikes, and other disasters.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>sealable</b> diving chamber, closed bell or dry bell is a {{pressure}} vessel with hatches {{large enough for}} people to enter and exit, and a compressed breathing gas supply to raise the internal air pressure. Such chambers provide a supply of oxygen for the user, and are usually called hyperbaric chambers whether used underwater or at the water surface or on land to produce underwater pressures. However, some use submersible chamber to refer to those used underwater and hyperbaric chamber for those used out of water. There are two related terms that reflect particular usages rather than technically different types: ...|$|E
5000|$|Identified with Soviet {{rule and}} issued in all Warsaw Pact armies, the ushanka {{has become a}} part of the winter uniform for {{military}} and police forces in Canada, the United States, and other Western countries with a cold winter. Gray (military, American police), green (for camouflage), blue (police, United States Post Office) and black (navy) versions are in current usage. In 2013, however, the Russian army announced that the ushanka was being replaced by new headgear, which is essentially the same ushanka with a rounder crown and small <b>sealable</b> openings in the flaps for wearing headphones.|$|E
50|$|The world's {{population}} is urbanising {{at a pace}} that outstrips existing infrastructure and municipal capabilities, making society's ability to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) increasingly challenging. There is a need for an alternative sanitation option where on-site sanitation and sewerage are not feasible. Container-Based Sanitation (CBS) refers to a system where excreta is collected in <b>sealable,</b> removable cartridges that are transported to treatment facilities. Container-based sanitation is usually provided as a service involving provision of certain types of portable toilets, and collection of excreta at a cost borne by the users. Examples of organizations that provide this service are Loowatt in Madagascar, Clean Team in Ghana, X-Runner in Peru, and SOIL in Haiti.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in June 2007, {{eight people}} {{contracted}} botulism {{due to the}} consumption of [...] "Hot Dog Chili Sauce" [...] and other products manufactured by the Castleberry's Food Company plant in Augusta, Georgia, which were under-processed, resulting {{in the production of}} botulinum toxin within the cans. At that time, the Castleberry's plant was owned and operated by Bumble Bee. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed the food poisoning to Castleberry's Food Company's use of a defective canning process which was inadequate to destroy spores of clostridium botulinum bacteria, thereby enabling the bacteria to produce botulinum toxin as the products aged. An FDA investigation later revealed that the problem arose from the use of canners which [...] "had broken alarms, a leaky valve and an inaccurate temperature device." [...] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised consumers to dispose of foods recalled due to the food poisoning incidents in the following manner:Do not open or puncture any unopened can of the recalled product ... Dispose of food that may be contaminated by placing in a <b>sealable</b> bag, wrapping another plastic bag around the <b>sealable</b> bag, and then taping tightly. Place bags in a trash receptacle for non-recyclable trash outside the home and out of reach of humans and pets. Do not discard the food in a sink, garbage disposal, or toilet. Avoid splashing and contact with the skin. Wear rubber or latex gloves when handling open containers of food that you think may be contaminated. Wash hands with soap and running water for at least 2 minutes after handling food or containers that may be contaminated.|$|E

The final step in the disposal of sharps waste is to dispose of them in an autoclave. A less common approach is to incinerate them; typically only chemotherapy sharps waste is incinerated. Steps must be taken along the way to minimize the risk of injury from this material, while maximizing the amount of sharps material disposed.
