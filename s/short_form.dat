50|$|As {{opposed to}} full forms used in formal situations, <b>short</b> <b>forms</b> {{of a name}} are used in {{communication}} between well-acquainted people, usually relatives, friends and colleagues. <b>Short</b> <b>forms</b> emerged in spoken language for convenience as majority of formal names are cumbersome. They are multi-syllabic, their phonetical structure sometimes doesn't comply with Russian phonetics, as they contain unusual sequences of phonems. <b>Short</b> <b>forms</b> being stylistically neutral, demonstrate that people using them are in close relationships and equal statuses. In case when elder people address younger ones, short names also are stylistically neutral.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This review {{highlights}} {{the generation of}} various types of <b>short</b> <b>forms</b> of membrane hormonal receptors and the mode of regulation of their tissue-specific patterns. The <b>short</b> <b>forms</b> of membrane receptors are classified {{on the basis of}} localization of missing functional fragments. The review provides examples of tissues for which expression of <b>short</b> <b>forms</b> may serve as a marker of changes of ontogenetic stage, physiological state, or the development of pathological process. The <b>short</b> <b>forms</b> of receptors are shown to participate in determining tissue-specificity and efficacy of hormonal signal transduction, as well as in transport of hormones within cell, through physiological barriers, and in blood circulation. Peculiarities of signal transduction pathways for <b>short</b> receptor <b>forms</b> and potential physiological significance of these forms are analyzed. It is concluded that the ratio of long and <b>short</b> receptor <b>forms</b> may serve as a key marker of dynamic changes of differentiation stage and alterations of metabolic and proliferative activity of tissues under normal and pathologic conditions, and thus to be an important indicator of therapeutic effect for many pathological processes. Key words: membrane hormone receptors, receptor <b>short</b> <b>forms,</b> alternative splicing, signal transduction, hormone transport According to the initial classification of membrane hormone receptors based on the main principles of their structure-functional organization, receptors were divided into several superfamilies, each characterized by a “central...|$|R
