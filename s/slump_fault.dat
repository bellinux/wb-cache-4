50|$|Many volcanoes produce deformational {{structures}} as they grow. The {{flanks of}} volcanoes commonly exhibit shallow gravity <b>slumps,</b> <b>faults</b> and associated folds. Large volcanoes grow {{not only by}} adding erupted material to their flanks, but also by spreading laterally at their bases, particularly if they rest on weak or ductile materials. As a volcano grows in size and weight, the stress field underneath the volcano changes from compressional to extensional. A subterranean rift may develop {{at the base of}} the volcano where the crust is wrenched apart. This volcanic spreading may initiate further structural deformation in the form of thrust faults along the volcano's distal flanks, pervasive grabens and normal faults across the edifice, and catastrophic flank failure (sector collapse). Mathematical analysis shows that volcanic spreading operates on volcanoes at a wide range of scales and is theoretically similar to the larger-scale rifting that occurs at mid-ocean ridges (divergent plate boundaries). Thus, in this view, the distinction between tectonic plate, spreading volcano, and rift is nebulous, all being part of the same geodynamic system.|$|R
40|$|Middle Cambrian {{microbial}} limestone {{contains a}} network of unusual, predominantly horizontal cavities up to 2 m in length and 0. 5 m in height. The microbialite experienced rapid syndepositional lithification, but adjacent grainstone sediments remained unlithified during deposition. This juxtaposition contributed to sediment instability, resulting in fracturing and brecciation of the lithified microbialite while unconsolidated grainstones underwent slumping and injection into some cavities. Remaining space within the cavities was colonized {{by a series of}} encrustations: thin crusts (2 – 8 mm) of laminated algal mats, followed by several generations of calcified Renalcis-like cyanobacteria up to 45 mm thick. Remaining void space was partially filled by internal sediment, and then sequentially occluded by banded radiaxial fibrous calcite, herringbone calcite, and finally saddle dolomite cements. The radiaxial and herringbone calcite cements precipitated from porewaters derived from seawater that became anoxic through the breakdown of organic matter in the microbialite. Noteworthy is the presence of herringbone calcite cement, not as a seafloor precipitate, but as an early cavity fill. We propose that the unusual bedding-parallel fractures were caused by gravity collapse along a shallow platform margin. Coeval foreslope sediments show syndepositional <b>slumping,</b> <b>faulting,</b> and mass flow deposits. These redeposited sediments contain boulders of microbialite and grainstone of platform margin provenance. 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the mineralogical composition of two cores recovered on the Academician Ridge (Central Lake Baikal, Siberia). Sedimentological features {{show that the}} cores are unaffected by turbidity currents. However, hemipelagic deposition is not continuous, but intermittently disturbed by syn- or post-sediment reworking (e. g., bioturbation, <b>slumps,</b> <b>faulting).</b> Such modes of deposition {{are consistent with the}} complex uplift history of the ridge. Bulk mineralogy suggests that terrigenous sediment supplies are constant through glacial/interglacial stages, and diluted by diatom-rich intervals related to warmer interglacial stages. The core stratigraphy is based on the correlation of the diatom zonation and opal abundance with the marine oxygen isotope reference curve SPECMAP. The similar to 8 -m cores partly recover the last four interglacial/glacial cycles, i. e., since oxygen isotope stage 8. We test the use of clay minerals as a proxy for paleoclimatic reconstruction. The clays are more weathered during the diatom-rich intervals in agreement with warmer climate conditions. However, the mean clay composition does not change significantly through glacial/interglacial stages. This observation implies that, in the Academician Ridge sediments, a simple smectite/illite ratio (S/I) does not alone provide a reliable indicator of climatic variation. It reflects the complex clay assemblages, especially the smectite group, delivered to Central Lake Baikal. Smectites include primarily illite-smectite mixed layers, made of a mixture of montmorillonite and beidellite. According to their behavior after cation saturation, the illite-smectite mixed layers are primarily transformed smectites, with some neoformed smectites intermittently observed. In addition, Al-smectites occur in minor proportions. We conclude that the S/I ratio has a climatic significance only if it evolves in parallel with the weathering stage of the clays and is confirmed by a change in the composition of the smectites.

40|$|Stromatolites {{are formed}} by physical, biological, and {{chemical}} processes, and combinations of specific processes produced the {{great variety of}} textures and morphologies in the geologic record. I here introduce a new technique for mesoscale chemical mapping for stromatolite interpretation. In particular, I use x-ray fluorescence microscopy (?XRF) to identify spatial associations between various elements (?fluorescence microfacies?) to infer the physical, biological, and chemical processes that produced the observed compositional distributions. As a test case, elemental distributions from ?XRF scans of stromatolites from the Nsuze Group (2. 98 Ga) were analyzed to develop a fluorescence microfacies growth model. There are six major fluorescence microfacies: laminated dolostone, laminated chert, clotted dolostone and chert, stromatolite clast breccia, and cavity fill. Laminated dolostone is composed of microlaminated ferroan dolomite with isolated quartz, rutile, zircon, and unidentified Fe-rich grains. Individual dolomitic laminae contain syndepositional <b>slumps,</b> <b>faults,</b> or current structures. These laminae were likely formed primarily by trapping and binding microbial mats that precipitated carbonate mud at a shallow depth below the mat surface. Laminated chert is composed of microquartz with minor fine-grained phyllosilicates, heavy minerals, and rare sand-sized K-rich grains. Pinnacle structures, roll-ups, and oversteepened laminations suggest that this fluorescence facies was produced by the secondary silicification of microbial mats. The clotted dolostone and chert fluorescence microfacies are composed of intergrown chert and dolomite, which may appear as cryptically laminated clots. It forms high-relief cauliform mounds and had high original porosity that was frequently filled with intergrown chert and Mn-rich dolomitic cavity fill. Stromatolite clast breccias are matrix-supported breccias containing a mixture of stromatolitic clasts and heavy mineral grains. This facies was likely formed as lag deposits filling erosional scours and interstromatolite spaces. Cavities in the clotted dolostone and chert and stromatolite clast breccia fluorescence microfacies were filled by microquartz, Mn-rich dolomite, and partially dolomitized calcite (cavity fill fluorescence microfacies) ...|$|R

The existence of methane at relatively shallow depths and extensive areas of gas hydrates have been mapped in this region.

The troughs lie on top of a basement high implying a relationship between the troughs and the basement feature. Differential accumulation and compaction may explain the origin of the troughs. Sediment deposited around the basement high preferentially accumulates on gentle slopes and in troughs. This results in a thick sequence of sediment on the flanks of the basement high and a thin sequence above on top of the hill. Unstable sediment masses and differential compaction generate a tensile-stress field above the peak of the basement high which causes <b>slumping</b> and <b>faulting.</b> The steep slopes generated by <b>faulting</b> and <b>slumping</b> may then serve to intensify tidal currents or act as spillways and locally generate increased turbulence.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{characterization of}} Mass-Transport Deposits or MTDs, {{in terms of}} emplacement processes, depositional products, structural properties and internal architecture, is crucial to define the hydraulic properties of slope-to-basinal deposits. In fact, MTDs are distinct mechanical units and significant heterogeneities within sedimentary succession. They may show different fractures parameters, including intensity and orientation of fractures, when compared to underlying and overlying undeformed strata. MTDs can therefore {{play a significant role}} in hydrocarbon exploration and production, inasmuch as they may act as barriers or conduits for fluid flow in the subsurface. The Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous basinal Maiolica Formation exposed in the Gargano Promontory (southern Italy) represents an ideal natural laboratory to study the stratigraphic architecture of ancient MTDs. This formation consists of undisturbed intervals of flat-lying, light coloured, thin-bedded, cherty micritic limestone interbedded with chaotic intervals characterized by extensively folded and contorted strata of similar facies. The stratigraphic thickness of these deformed strata, which are interpreted to be slump/slide deposits and, to a lesser extent, debris-flow deposits, varies from several decimetres to tens of metres. The internal deformation comprises down-slope verging soft-sediment folds, and both normal and reverse faults. Normal faults are most common in the updip portion of the MTDs, whereas reverse faults are best developed toward their frontal margins, where they often form imbricates of multiple thrusts. In several places, the studied MTDs exhibit signs of reworking, as demonstrated by reactivation of the <b>slump</b> related <b>faults</b> resulting in deformation of beds overlying the MTDs. The structural properties and the distribution of studied MTDs are discussed in the context of the Cretaceous tectonics of the Gargano Promontory, as well as on the characteristics of the paleoslope of the Apulian Platform...|$|R
40|$|Within the Middle Triassic Doig Formation of Western Canada {{there are}} thick {{sandstone}} bodies encased in muddier sedi-ment — “anomalously thick sandstone bodies ” (ATSBs). Interpretations vary from incised valleys, deltaic, barrier islands, turbidites in slope slumps, to shallow-water gravity-flow beds overlain by shoreface deposits in a <b>slump</b> or growth <b>fault.</b> Several authors have interpreted the uppermost {{beds in the}} sandstone bodies as shoreface deposits. The thick sandstone bodies were deposited {{during a period of}} regression and transgression but authors disagree {{as to whether or not}} the ATSBs and enclosing strata were deposited contemporaneously. Abrupt basal contacts, apparently abrupt lateral contacts, and stratigraphic relationships favour the sandstone bodies to be post-mudstone, formed during late regression. The most probable explanation for the origin of ATSBs is that during late regression, structural depressions formed on a muddy, pre-existing shelf and were filled by sandy sediment. Initial deposits in the thicker sandstone bodies commonly are debris-flow and/or slump deposits that filled in the deeper parts of the depression. As the depression filled, sediment entered wave- and current-influenced water depths and more typical shoreface deposits began to form. As regression proceeded some sandstone bodies were truncated by a regressive surface of marine erosion. Finally, all ATSBs and adjacent sediment were capped by a thin veneer of transgressive sediment. RÉSUM...|$|R

The Black Sea sediments are rich in calcite and organic carbon, the latter showing a high degree of {{preservation}} due to anoxia in the waters below 100 - 150 m. Slope failures and sediment instability related to immense gas and gas hydrate accumulations are serious problems that can lead to the failure of offshore installations. Marine geophysical surveys have been carried out in the Eastern Black Sea basin using state-of the-art technology to produce sonar and high-resolution maps. A number of prominent structures were detected in the area such as <b>slumping,</b> sliding, pockmarks, <b>faults</b> and dome-like structures. In the Turkish near shore and the abyssal plain, shallow gas accumulations have been detected and are continuous about 25 - 65 m beneath the seafloor.

40|$|The western Terrebonne Parish area in South Louisiana {{contains}} various {{amounts of}} geologic features and processes. <b>Slumping,</b> growth <b>faulting,</b> anticlines, and salt tectonics {{are only a}} few that are present here. One of the largest oil and gas discoveries during the 1990 ’s in South Louisiana was the Etouffee Prospect. Located south of Kent Bayou Field in Terrebonne Parish, the Etouffee Prospect developed estimated reserves of about 250 BCFE. Newly acquired 3 D seismic data of the area developed in the 1990 ’s helped identify this prospect. The survey {{was one of the first}} to fully explore and provide deeper imagery of the onshore of South Louisiana. This thesis provides an explanation and interpretation on how the Etouffee and other sand horizons formed. Along with this, various maps were produced to illustrate thicknesses of multiple sand horizons and the overall structure of the area. Both isopach and structure maps, were developed in Petra software. When comparing the Etouffee Sands to the other sands in the area, the final results of these maps showed a significant change in thickness and depth. Correlating well logs throughout the area further helped the interpretation and understanding of the depositional environments in which these sands were deposited in. These correlations were done in Petra software and showed the locations of several faults that were present. The well logs around the Etouffee Sands produced higher gamma ray, resistivity, and neutron density measurements than the other logs in the data set. Using 3 D Kingdom software, horizons and faults were picked and interpreted. Some of these horizons include the Textularia L (Tex L) and Robulus L (Rob L) sands. Interpreting these horizons helped understand not only the structure of the area, but to see how the horizons develop and change across the region. The biggest faults and most developed horizons were identified around the Etouffee Sands area, including the Etouffee Fault. Multiple paleontological reports were retrieved displaying the paleobathymetry of the different foraminferal biostratigraphic units in the area.

Gravity-induced structures, mainly <b>slumps</b> and associated <b>faults,</b> suggest the existence of paleoslopes and the dominance of gravitational tectonics during the early and middle Miocene, at the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary, and during the Quaternary. Several types of mud-filled veins having various shapes were observed. These are especially abundant in the middle Miocene siliceous claystones and porcellanites from the Kita-Yamato Trough. They have been interpreted as dewatering conduits that formed preferentially in highly porous, water-saturated diatomaceous muds on a slope, because of episodic loss of sediment strength, collapse of the sediment framework, and consequent fluid migration. The central part of the vein serves once as a fluid conduit, whereas the transition between conduit-controlled and intergranular flow occurs at the branching extremities, with concentration of fines. The likely trigger responsible for the strength loss is seismic activity. Development of these veins, spatially and chronologically linked to small normal microfaults, implies an extensional regime having layer-parallel extension and a local bedding-parallel shear couple, probably the result of gravitational gliding.

40|$|Generation of tsunamis by slow {{submarine}} processes (<b>faulting,</b> <b>slumps</b> or slides) is investigated, {{in search}} for possible amplification mechanisms resulting from lateral spreading of the sea floor uplift. A linearized solution for constant water depth is derived by transform methods (Laplace in time and Fourier in space), for sea floor uplift represented by a sliding Heaviside step function (i. e. a simplified Haskell source model, with zero rise time). The model is used to study the tsunami amplitude amplification (wave amplitude normalized by the final sea floor uplift) {{as a function of}} the model parameters. The results show that, above the source, the amplification is larger for larger uplifted area and for smaller water depth, and is the largest in the direction of uplift spreading, for velocity of spreading comparable to the long period tsunami velocity. Near the source, this amplification could be one order of magnitude. This amplification mechanism seen in the near-field is a form of wave focusing, and is manifested by a high frequency pulse, with amplitude attenuating with distance due to dispersion and geometric spreading. In the far-field, the linear theory predicts maximum amplification equal to one, as predicted by point source models.

If the volcano rests on sediments containing mechanically weak layers (e.g., beds of water-saturated clay), detachment zones (decollements) may develop in the weak layers. The extensional stresses in the detachment zones can produce giant landslides and normal faults on the volcano's flanks, leading to the formation of a basal escarpment. Further from the volcano, these detachment zones can express themselves as a succession of overlapping, gravity driven thrust faults. This mechanism has long been cited as an explanation of the Olympus Mons aureole deposits (discussed below).|$|R

We studied the development of two different classes of normal faults: faults that offset the igneous basement and faults restricted to the sediment section. Faults that cut the basement seaward of the Japan Trench also offset the seafloor and are therefore able to be well characterized from multiple bathymetric surveys. Images of 199 basement-cutting faults reveal an average throw of approximately 120  m and average fault spacing of approximately 2  km. Faults within the sediment column are poorly documented and exhibit offsets of approximately 20  m, with densely spaced populations near the trench axis. Regional seismic lines show lateral variations in location of the Japan Trench deformation front throughout the region, documenting the incoming plate’s influence on the deformation front’s location. Where horst blocks are carried into the trench, seaward propagation of the deformation front is diminished compared to areas where a graben has entered the trench. We propose that the décollement’s propagation into the trench graben {{may be influenced by}} local stress changes or displacements due to subduction of active normal faults. The location and geometry of the up-dip décollement at the Japan Trench is potentially controlled by the incoming outer-rise faults.|$|R

The Norbeck Ridge landslide is a large landslide adjacent to State Route 240, the main road into the park. Two landslides east of Norbeck Ridge, the Cedar Pass and Cliff Shelf slides, were stabilized in a $ 14 million US DOT project after landslide movement threatened to destroy the road (Monley 2000). Technical reports from investigation of those slides suggest that the Cliff Shelf was a block-glide-style landslide, that is, a coherent mass moving along a planar zone of weakness. Landslides occurring along the wall in the Badlands are complex, and may be the result of more than one mass movement process. However, based on our field observation in 2010 and 2011, Norbeck Ridge landslide is a rotational <b>slump,</b> and the <b>fault</b> mapped near the landslide is a slump scarp. In support of this conclusion, we observed numerous zones of rotational slumping in the outcrop of the Norbeck Ridge. We observed this same mass movement style in adjacent areas, such as the landslide at Saddle Pass trail. Thus, while the larger Cliff Shelf slide may be a block glide, the dominant slide mechanism at Norbeck Ridge appears to be rotational slumping. Detachment in one or more clay-rich, poorly consolidated strata in the Upper Scenic Formation or the Lower Poleslide, perhaps above and below the informally named disappointment limestone interval as suggested by Evanoff (2010), appears to be the mechanism for slide motion. After the 2010 expedition, the field team concluded tentatively that the Norbeck Ridge slide is inactive and too thin a deposit to threaten the park road. However, after the 2011 field season we now believe that the Norbeck Ridge slide is inactive, or only intermittently active, but has the potential to reactivate with destructive consequences for the park road. Ephemeral sag ponds at the head of the Norbeck Ridge slide could create conditions conducive to further slumping. Other geological characteristics that may have influenced landslide development in the field area include gentle southward dipping and vertical jointing of lithologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} number of recently acquired 3 D seismic surveys over large areas of passive margin settings has led to considerable advances in the comprehension of deep-water depositional systems (Fonnesu, 2003). In this project have been used a 3 D seismic data from Western part of the Lower Congo Basin, offshore Angola, to investigate deep-water depositional systems to characterize channel systems along the pinch out features in terms of geometries, morphometric and architectural elements {{with respect to the}} growing salt anticline. It is mainly based on attribute plan-view maps and 2 D seismic sections view. For that, the studied stratigraphic sequence bounded by horizons A and B base and top respectively is subdivided in three different stages namely stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 from extracted isoproportional slices. The interpreted stage 1 shows weakly confined system characterized by organized sinuous stacking channels A and B, 500 m &# 150; 2 km wide, 14 km long, east &# 150; west trend for channel A and 150 m &# 150; 1. 5 km wide, 13 km long, east &# 150; west trend for channel B. The channels in this stage are classified as meandering channel belts due to their sinuosity values according to Janocko et al., (2013). The interpreted stage 2 shows confined system characterized by disorganized stacking channels C and D, 1 &# 150; 2 km wide, 8 km long, northeast &# 150; southwest trend for channel C and 1 &# 150; 3. 5 km wide, 12 km long, east &# 150; west trend for channel D. According to Janocko et al., (2013), the channels in this stage are considered non meandering channel belts due to their low sinuosity values. In the last stage 3, are interpreted different features such as polygonal <b>faults,</b> <b>slump</b> deposits and pockmarks. All different features identified in three studied stages, gives idea that the study area has been strongly affected by salt tectonics which therefore impacted the development, morphology and orientation of the channel systems within the studied stratigraphic sequence.

40|$|New {{investigations}} {{carried on}} the Jurassic successions of the Tacchi area (Eastern Sardinia) have given a more detailed knowledge of the local stratigraphy and sedimentology. Geological mapping and litho-sedimentological analysis heve provided a detailed framework for the vertical and areal development and evolution of the sedimentary facies, and also allowed an accurate paleogeographical construction. The Genna Selole Fm. (Bajocian-Bathonian) (DIENI et alii, 1983), constituting {{the base of the}} Tacchi Jurassic succession, is built of siliciclastic to mixed, siliciclastic-carbonate, deposits. It was laid down in depositional environments ranging from distal alluvial fan to transitional lagoonal-littoral. In places the Genna Selole is absent and so the marine Dorgali Dolostones Fm. (Bathonian-Kimmeridgian) (DIENI et alii, 1983), directly overlies the folded Paleozoic basement. The omission of the Genna Selole Fm. suggests the presence of uplifted areas of erosion and alteration whose location has been controlled by structural, syn-depositional factors, as a possible Variscan paleo-high. Based on new evidence, the Genna Selole Fm. has been subdivided into three lithofacies: A) a conglomeratic lithofacies (Laconi-Gadoni Lithofacies); B) a sandyclayey lithofacies (Nurri-Escalaplano Lithofacies); and a mixed siliciclastic- carbonate lithofacies (Ussassai-Perdasdefogu Lithofacies), this latter constituting the gradual passage to the following Dorgali Dolostones Fm. In addition, features observed in the Genna Selole Fm. (<b>slumps,</b> synsedimentary <b>faults,</b> neptunian dykes, seismic breccias) suggest active coeval extensional tectonics. The thickness of the Genna Selole Fm. is between 0 and 50 m. We propose two others additional parastratotypes for this formation in the Escalaplano and Perdasdefogu areas, characterized by good continuity and exposure, and so integrating the stratotype described by DIENI et alii (1983). The comprehensive analysis of the Genna Selole Fm. isopachs and of its lithofacies in the Tacchi area evidences the presence, and the subsequent gradual burial and flooding, of a morpho-structural high («alto morfostrutturale barbaricino») developed in Central Sardinia, due to the coeval extensional tectonics prevailing during the Lower and Middle Jurassic. The upper Dorgali Dolostones Fm., up to 250 - 300 m thick, is characterized by different lithofacies all referable to inter- to subtidal environments of a carbonate shelf (stromatolitic mounds, lagoonal sediments, storm layers, flaser bedding, herringbone cross stratification, oolitic shoals and bars, possible internal breccias of tectonic origin), extending between the carbonate lagoon and the platform break. The most widespread deposits are irregular alternations of calcarenitic storm layers and bioturbated mudstones. In the easternmost areas (Tacchi of Seui, Ulassai and Tertenia- Jerzu), 300 m of the Dorgali Dolostones Fm. are overlain abruptly by little, previously unknown, calcareous outcrops, having a maximum thickness of 40 m, referable to the M. Tului and M. Bardia Fms (AMADESI et alii, 1960). These are formed by oolitic calcarenites, oolitic-bioclastic calcirudites-calcarenites, coralline framestones, subordinated calcilutites and possible accumulations of fore-reef breccias. The presence of Ellipsactinia suggests an Upper Jurassic age. The depositional environments of the Monte Bardia and Monte Tului Fms. could be referred to platform margin areas where oolitic bars and limited bioconstructions (patch-reef) developed. Based on the described data, and taking in account the low protecting bioconstruction belt, the whole sedimentation environment can be referred to a shelf with ramp configuration. The overall depositional framework of the Jurassic succession can be related to a progressively deepening transgressive sequence, maybe correlatable with the extensional tectonics causing the development of the Tethys sea. Finally, an attempt has been made to hypotesize a regional framework of the Tacchi area both within the Sardinian Mesozoic successions, and in the Tethyan context...|$|R

The Corte Madera Gabbro pluton lies within the Peninsular Ranges batholith approximately 50 km east of San Diego, California. The gabbro intruded into metamorphosed pelitic rocks and was, in turn, intruded by more silicic plutons. The gabbroic rocks have been divided into three groups based on structural, textural, and mineralogical parameters. The A group consists of hornblende leucogabbro, troctolite, olivine gabbronorite, pyroxene-hornblende gabbronorite, minor anorthosite, and an occurrence of clinopyroxenite. The B group consists of orthopyroxene hornblende gabbronorite and hornblende gabbro, and the C group consists primarily of biotite-quartz norite. The A group contains cumulate textures, mineral layering, and synplutonic faults, and forms a basinal structure which is tilted to the southwest. The B group forms a cryptically zoned lobe with steeply dipping foliation. The C group forms a fairly homogeneous mantle around the A group and contains inclusions of prebatholithic rocks. The pluton is generally high in Al 2 O 3, and low in K 2 O, TiO 2, and total alkalis. The geochemistry of the major trace elements emphasizes the differences between the three groups. The C group is consistently richer in SiO 2, total alkalis, P 2 O 5, Rb, Sr, Y, Ba, Zr, and Nb. Based on various differentiation indices, the A group is least fractionated and the C group is most fractionated. The A and B groups show a continuous iron-enrichment trend, whereas the C group shows no consistent trend. The jump in concentration of many elements between the B and C groups cannot be explained by simple fractionation models. The parent magma for the pluton was a hydrous high-alumina basalt with island-arc affinities. The magma rose from a Jurassic Benioff zone to an intermediate crustal level (total pressure greater than 5 kb) where clinopyroxene began to crystallize. The magma continued upward in a series of pulses to the present erosional level (2 kb). Blocks of country rock sank into and contaminated the first pulse of magma. The contaminated magma became fairly homogeneous and crystallized in place to form the C group rocks. A second pulse of magma intruded the C group rocks and plagioclase and olivine began to crystallize to form the A group rocks. Differential heat loss caused intermittent convective overturn producing a rhythmic layering and other sedimentary structures. Tectonic events triggered <b>slumping</b> and <b>faulting</b> of the unconsolidated rhythmic layers. A portion of the melt became isolated in a side chamber or old conduit zone and differentiated in-situ as the B group...|$|R
40|$|Cyclothems {{record the}} {{sedimentary}} product of cyclicity in relative sea-level on either a regional or global scale, showing both regressive and transgressive phases. This study aims {{to contribute to}} our understanding of the sedimentary consequences of relative sea-level rise in a Carboniferous transgressive sequence in County Clare, western Ireland. The transgression in focus is at the top of the Tullig Cyclothem, and is exposed in several sections over a distance of 46 km. The aims of this thesis are to describe and interpret: 1) the detailed sedimentology and stratigraphy of the transgressive upper portion of the Tullig Cyclothem, 2) the nature (continuous or stepped) of, and controls upon, relative sea-level change, and 3) the paleoenvironmental transition from fluvio-deltaic to open marine conditions, and how this ties in to the overall evolution of the Western Irish Namurian Basin. These aims have been achieved by examination of all the outcrops of the transgressive upper Tullig cyclothem in County Clare, which show considerable lateral variation from north to south. One complete section of the transgressive Tullig is exposed at Trusklieve, where the sedimentary infill begins at the top of the fluvio-deltaic sandstone channels of the Tullig Sandstone. At this point, relative sea-level was at its minimum, and the beginning of the transgression is marked by symmetrical dunes, reworked dunes, and Zoophycos trace fossils. This surface is overlain by nearly 20 meters of unfossiliferous dark grey shales and siltstones, which are more organic rich and contain siderite nodules at their base, and are then topped by 4 meters of sandstone sheets, and finally a goniatite-rich fossil bed. This goniatite band marks the maximum relative sea-level within the Tullig cyclothem, and a fully marine environment. In terms of outcrop thickness, there is significant lateral variability between the nine outcrops studied in this thesis. The outcrops in the north (i. e. Furreera and Cliffs of Moher) are significantly thinner (less than 10 meters) than their southern counterparts, with the outcrop at Carrowmore Point being exceptionally thick (~ 50 meters). Additionally, the ratio of sandstone to siltstone also varies significantly between outcrops, and between one and three coarsening-upwards parasequences can be identified at these different locations. The outcrops that are centrally-located in the region (between Diamond Rocks and Carrowmore Point) possess the greatest thicknesses of sands and also up to three parasequences. At these localities, the presence of thick sandstones overlying shales and mudstones correlates strongly with the presence of mud diapirs, large-scale <b>slumping</b> and growth <b>faults.</b> The field study is used to propose a model for paleoenvironmental change through the upper transgressive portion of the Tullig Cyclothem: a transition from active fluvio-deltaic sands and coals of the upper Tullig Sandstone, followed by subaqueous delta plain muds and silts, progradational mouth bar sands, and finally the Reticuloceras stubblefieldi goniatite fossil bed. These changing paleoenvironments are interpreted in terms of the competition between relative sea-level change, which itself appears to be controlled by both eustatic sea-level change and local subsidence, and sediment supply, which is determined by both distance to source (as affected by relative sea-level) and local river channel avulsion and abandonment...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} and lithology of {{a sequence of}} Mesozoic greywackes comprising the Torlesse terrane within the southern Ruahine Range has been mapped. At a scale of 1 : 25 000 the sequence was subdivided into informal lithozones {{with one or more}} lithozones constituting a higher order lithostratigraphic unit here referred to as a Lithotype. Each of three recognised Lithotypes occupies a consistent stratigraphic position throughout a 40 km long mapped area. From east to west the three Lithotypes are: (1) the Tamaki Lithotype; (2) the Wharite Lithotype; and (3) the Western Lithotype. The easternmost Tamaki Lithotype and the westernmost Western Lithotype consist of a relatively undeformed flysch-type sequence of distal turbidites. The centrally located wharite Lithotype structurally underlies the Tamaki Lithotype but overlies the Western Lithotype. It comprises a complex sequence of predominantly flysch-type sedimentary rocks, together with lithologically diverse, argillite-dominated, clast-bearing debris flow deposits; large sheet-like bodies of massive volcanics (and associated cherts) that have been emplaced by gravitational sliding; and intact pillow lava accumulations and horizons of red and green argillite of syndepositional origin. Major and trace element analyses of volcanic lithologies indicate that most samples were erupted in a mid-ocean ridge or intraplate setting. None appear to have been derived from an island arc setting. The bulk of the clastic sediments consist of reworked materials derived by the erosion of a mixed volcano-plutonic source and redeposited in a distal deep-water submarine fan environment. Blocks of allochthonous fossiliferous shallow-water lithologies indicate that the source terrane, in part, comprised rocks of Late Triassic age. Autochthonous fossils indicate that sedimentation continued until at least Late Jurassic time. Part of the stratigraphic sequence was severely deformed along a low angle thrust zone in Early Cretaceous time {{at the onset of the}} Rangitata Orogeny. An early phase of ductile deformation resulted in plastically and permanently deformed rocks. Ductile deformation is restricted to strata comprising the Wharite Lithotype which, with its allochthonous debris, in part, constitutes an olistostrome that has undergone tectonic deformation and hence also constitutes a melange. Thus it may be regarded as a tectonised olistostrome. Ductile deformation was succeeded by the development of shear fractures during subsequent phases of brittle deformation that affected strata comprising all three Lithotypes. Brittle deformation occurred in conjunction with episodes of faulting and folding during the second orogeny - the Kaikoura Orogeny in Pliocene to Recent times. Active faults that were initiated during the early phase of ductile deformation continued to be sites of active fault displacement throughout Quaternary and Holocene time. Late Quaternary tectonic features along these major active faults have been mapped. Minimum rates of vertical fault displacements since Ohakean time approximate 1 mm/yr in this area. Several phases of folding were recognised, including: (1) an early phase of syndepositional, highly asymmetric folds with well developed axial plane cleavage; and (2) three post-lithification phases of folding - e. g. (a) steeply plunging isoclinal folds; (b) subhorizontal, open asymmetric folds; and (c) steeply plunging open folds. Contacts between the three Lithotypes are not thought to be major tectonic breaks but are instead of primary depositional origin and have become sites of subsequent fault movement in Quaternary time. The three Lithotypes may therefore represent a near complete eastward dipping, westward younging overturned stratigraphic sequence. They are not fault-bound terranes. Metamorphism to prehnite pumpellyite grade, folding and rotation of the strata to its present steep attitude predates Late Cretaceous sedimentation. The westward rotation and imbrication of thrust sheets that are internally westward younging but form part of a regionally eastward younging succession of thrust sheets was the result of underthrusting at a convergent plate margin. The relationship between structural and lithological characteristics of the Torlesse bedrock and the magnitude of valley slope erosion in the southern Ruahine Range is investigated. Comparison of aerial photographs spanning a 28 year period between 1946 and 1974 indicate that erosion has increased by 91 %. The greatest proportion of this eroded area occurs on the steeper north- and west-facing slopes. Saturation of colluvium during major storm events is the prime triggering mechanism for the majority of shallow translational slope movements. Debris slides and debris avalanches predominate and result from failure at less than 1 m depth at the colluvium-bedrock contact. Rock slides are few in number and are structurally controlled, failing along bedding plane surfaces at greater than 1 m depth. Rock falls and rock topples are least numerous and only involve small quantities of material. An erosion rate of 1215 m 3 /ha/yr for the southern Ruahine Range is of the same order of magnitude as other New Zealand and overseas studies and although considered to be severe it is not unduly excessive. Much of the forest deterioration in this area is due to the opening of the canopy by the successive removal of large tracts of forest vegetation through mass movement processes during episodes of increased rainfall. Large-scale rotational and translational mass movement features including rock slumps, earth slumps, earth slides and ridge-top features (involving bedrock only), have been documented from 109 localities. A relationship between the incidence of rock <b>slumps</b> and major <b>fault</b> breccia zones has been established in this area. The majority of large-scale mass movement features failed in pre-historic time but two failed in historic time. The consequences of future mass movements upon lowland areas adjacent to the base of the Range is discussed. A map showing the relative stability of slopes and the predominant forms of slope movement most likely to occur under the present seismic, climatic, physiographic and human conditions is presente...|$|R
