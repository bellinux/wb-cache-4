40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Erysipelothrix are facultative anaerobic, gram-positive small rods that are {{ubiquitous}} in nature, found worldwide, and have been recognized {{as a cause of}} infection in animals and humans since the 18802 ̆ 7 s (Wood and Henderson, 2006). Strains have been isolated from many wild and domestic animal species including reptile, fish, amphibians, and humans; however, Erysipelothrix spp. is most economically important as the cause of <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas</b> (Wood, 1984). As one of the oldest diseases recognized by the swine industry, the isolation and diagnosis of <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas</b> continues to hinder laboratory technicians and diagnosticians worldwide. This is evidenced by numerous protocols that have been described in the literature examining different culture and molecular methods aimed to isolate and identify Erysipelothrix. Diagnosis is complicated due to cultural characteristics, notably small colony size, and small numbers of organisms present in lesions (Fidalgo et al., 2000). Isolation of the organism from contaminated specimens further compounds the issue and potential errors related to recognition have been reported (Dunbar and Clarridge, III, 2000). Chapter 3 describes the development and validation of a modified enrichment broth technique for the isolation of Erysipelothrix from experimentally and naturally infected swine (Bender et al., 2009). This research indicates that an enrichment broth technique should be used by veterinary diagnostic laboratories. Data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) continues to implicate <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas</b> {{as one of the top}} ten reasons for swine condemnations at slaughter. Economic losses due to Erysipelothrix infection occur from increased numbers of acute deaths, treatments costs, vaccination costs, and slow growth of diseased pigs (Wood, 1984). Chapter 4 describes the adoption of an enrichment broth technique to investigate condemnations at slaughter suspected to be due to <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas.</b> In addition, isolates obtained from condemned tissues were further characterized to evaluate the potential presence of new Erysipelothrix strains as this has not been investigated since the 19702 ̆ 7 s.

40|$|In the United States organisms, which {{culturally}} are mouse septicemia or <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas</b> bacilli, {{have been}} {{isolated from the}} tonsils of five of sixteen pigs examined. These pigs all had hog-cholera, but {{it is probable that}} the bacilli were in the tonsils before they were infected with hog-cholera, and {{there is no evidence that}} they played any part in the disease. The distribution of the infection seemed to be restricted as most of the pigs from which the bacilli were obtained came from one litter. As we do not have clinical rotlauf, or <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas,</b> in this country, as these organisms, in Europe, have been found in a large percentage of apparently normal swine, and as the disease is produced with difficulty by the injection of cultures, the question may be raised whether they are not secondary invaders rather than the primary cause of the disease with which they have been associated, or else whether the resistance of swine on the European continent does not differ from that of our breeds as a result of differences in foods. It is possible that the mouse septicemia bacilli found in this country may differ culturally from those present in animals with <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas.</b> With this in mind, the carbohydrate reactions, as well as other cultural characters not necessary for the identification of the bacilli isolated, have been studied. The disease produced by the injection of these bacilli into mice and pigeons has been studied and shown to be largely an intracellular process. The organisms are taken up by the endothelial cells lining the veins and capillaries; there they multiply and soon kill the cells. It has also been shown that the only type of cell in the blood stream which contains bacteria is the endothelial leucocyte, and the probabilities are that the free phagocytes have been detached from the lining of the vessels. The disease is acute, and the indications are that in the cells the bacilli find a favorable medium for their growth.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Recently, {{a series}} of acute <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas</b> {{outbreaks}} occurred in Eastern China. Eight strains isolated from cases of septicemia were determined as serotype 1 a, and 4 of the isolates were resistant to acriflavine. One isolate strain named HX 130709 was attenuated on agar media containing acriflavine dye. The 432 -bp hypervariable region in spaA gene {{of the field and}} attenuated strains were amplified and sequenced. It was further compared with the vaccine strain G 4 T 10, and thus, the eight field strains can be divided into four spaA-types. The partial spaA gene analysis also showed that no point mutations occurred among different archived passages of HX 130709 during the attenuation. Results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that eight distinct patterns with 22 to 30 DNA fragment bands were produced from field strains, and twelve distinct patterns with 23 to 27 DNA fragment bands were produced from different passages of the attenuated strains. Mouse pathogenicity test showed that the mortality of the mice infected with 104 CFU field strains was 100 % and the attenuation of strain HX 130709 occurred between 46 and 50 passages. All the field and attenuated strains were highly sensitive to β-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines and macrolides. So, we can make conclusions that the acute <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas</b> outbreaks in Eastern China were caused by serotype 1 a E. rhusiopathiae strains with different biochemical characteristics, and the virulence of serotype 1 a E. rhusiopathiae strains is unrelated with some point mutations in 432 -bp hypervariable region of the spaA gene...|$|E
40|$|Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{as a cause}} of infection in animals and man since the late 1880 s. It is the aetiological agent of <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas,</b> and also causes economically important diseases in turkeys, chickens, ducks and emus, and other farmed animals such as sheep. The organism has the ability to persist for long periods in the environment and survive in marine locations. Infection in man is occupationally related, occurring principally as a result of contact with animals, their products or wastes. Human infection can take one of three forms: a mild cutaneous infection known as erysipeloid, a diffuse cutaneous form and a serious although rare systemic complication with septicaemia and endocarditis. While {{it has been suggested that}} the incidence of human infection could be declining because of technological advances in animal industries, infection still occurs in specific environments. Furthermore, infection by the organism may be under-diagnosed because of the resemblance it bears to other infections and the problems that may be encountered in isolation and identification. Diagnosis of erysipeloid can be difficult if not recognised clinically, as culture is lengthy and the organism resides deep in the skin. There have been recent advances in molecular approaches to diagnosis and in understanding of Erysipelothrix taxonomy and pathogenesis. Two PCR assays have been described for the diagnosis of <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas,</b> one of which has been applied successfully to human samples.

40|$|We have {{previously}} described the creation by Tn 916 mutagenesis of avirulent transposition mutants from a highly virulent strain of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, the causative agent of <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas.</b> In this study, we cloned a 2. 2 -kb DNA fragment which flanked the Tn 916 insertion in an avirulent mutant (strain 33 H 6) and evaluated {{the possibility that}} this region {{could be used for}} the specific detection of E. rhusiopathiae. According to the sequences of this region, oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify a 937 -bp fragment of the E. rhusiopathiae chromosome by PCR. The specificity of the PCR was investigated by analyzing 64 strains of Erysipelothrix species and 27 strains of other genera different from Erysipelothrix. A 937 -bp DNA fragment could be amplified from all E. rhusiopathiae strains tested, and no amplification was observed by using DNAs from the other species tested. To make a rapid and definite diagnosis of <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas</b> in slaughterhouses, we developed an enrichment broth cultivation-PCR combination assay, which used a commercially available DNA extraction kit, to identify E. rhusiopathiae in the specimens from swine with arthritis. After samples were enriched in selective broth culture, detection of E. rhusiopathiae was tested by either conventional methods or the PCR. Of 102 samples tested, 15 samples were positive by conventional methods and 12 of the 15 samples were positive by the PCR. The detection limit of the PCR was 103 CFU per reaction mixture for the PCR-positive samples.

All serotype 1 a isolates were further examined for acriflavine resistance and their genotypes to discriminate {{them from the}} attenuated live vaccine strain, defined as serotype 1 a, which is resistant to 0. 02 % acriflavine and which shows low levels of pathogenicity in mice. Of the serotype 1 a isolates, 64. 6 % were acriflavine resistant, with 98. 4 % of these acriflavine-resistant strains having been isolated from animals with chronic arthritis. By randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, almost all the acriflavine-resistant serotype 1 a strains showed the 253 -bp band characteristic of vaccine strains and were easily discriminated from all 113 strains of acriflavine-sensitive serotype 1 a strains from animals with acute and subacute <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas.</b> The incidence of acriflavine-resistant strains of the distinctive RAPD type 1 - 2 was markedly {{higher than that of}} the other RAPD types and serotypes.

Of these 63 isolates, 34 isolates (54. 0 %) were serotype 7, 20 isolates (31. 7 %) were serotype 2, 6 isolates (9. 5 %) were serotype 6, and 1 isolate (1. 6 %) each was serotype 11, 12, or 16. All isolates of serotypes 2, 6, 11, 12, and 16 were highly virulent for mice, whereas most isolates of serotype 7 were weakly virulent. In swine, all isolates of serotype 2 were highly virulent, capable of inducing generalized urticarial lesions with depression and anorexia. On the other hand, 37 of 43 isolates of serotypes other than 2 induced no clinical signs, and the remaining 6 isolates induced local urticarial lesions {{at the site of}} inoculation in swine. The MIC of dihydrostreptomycin ranged from 1. 56 to 100 micrograms/ml. All of the dihydrostreptomycin-resistant strains belonged to serotype 2. The high virulence of E. rhusiopathiae strains of serotype 2 harbored in the tonsils suggests a possible role of such strains in the cause of <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas.</b> In contrast, members of the other nonvirulent or weakly virulent group, mainly serotype 7 strains, were considered to be resident in porcine tonsils...|$|E
40|$|Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a Gram-positive {{bacterium}} {{that represents}} a new class, Erysipelotrichia, in the phylum Firmicutes. The organism is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas,</b> {{as well as a}} variety of diseases in many animals. Here, we report the first complete genome sequence analysis of a member of the class Erysipelotrichia. The E. rhusiopathiae genome (1, 787, 941 bp) is one of the smallest genomes in the phylum Firmicutes. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16 S rRNA gene and 31 universal protein families suggest that E. rhusiopathiae is phylogenetically close to Mollicutes, which comprises Mycoplasma species. Genome analyses show that the overall features of the E. rhusiopathiae genome {{are similar to those of}} other Gram-positive bacteria; it possesses a complete set of peptidoglycan biosynthesis genes, two-component regulatory systems, and various cell wall-associated virulence factors, including a capsule and adhesins. However, it lacks many orthologous genes for the biosynthesis of wall teichoic acids (WTA) and lipoteichoic acids (LTA) and the dltABCD operon, which is responsible for d-alanine incorporation into WTA and LTA, suggesting that the organism has an atypical cell wall. In addition, like Mollicutes, its genome shows a complete loss of fatty acid biosynthesis pathways and lacks the genes for the biosynthesis of many amino acids, cofactors, and vitamins, indicating reductive genome evolution. The genome encodes nine antioxidant factors and nine phospholipases, which facilitate intracellular survival in phagocytes. Thus, the E. rhusiopathiae genome represents evolutionary traits of both Firmicutes and Mollicutes and provides new insights into its evolutionary adaptations for intracellular survival...|$|E
40|$|Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is {{a causal}} agent of <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas,</b> {{which is of}} {{economic}} importance in the swine industry by virtue of causing acute septicemia, chronic arthritis, and endocarditis. However, {{little is known about}} the genetic properties of its protective antigens. Recently, a surface protective antigen (SpaA) gene was identified from serotype 2 in a mouse model. We cloned spaA from virulent strain Fujisawa (serotype 1 a) and determined that the N-terminal 342 amino acids without C-terminal repeats of 20 amino acids have the ability to elicit protection in mice. Fusions of 342 amino acids of Fujisawa SpaA and histidine hexamer (HisSpa 1. 0) protected pigs against challenge with both serotype 1 and serotype 2, the most important serotypes in the swine industry. Pigs immunized with HisSpa 1. 0 reacted well with both HisSpa 1. 0 and intact SpaA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. Serum collected at the time of challenge from a pig immunized with HisSpa 1. 0 markedly enhanced the in vitro phagocytic and killing activity of pig neutrophils against the bacteria. DNA sequences of protective regions of spaA genes from five strains of serotypes 1 and 2 were almost identical. The full DNA sequences also seemed to be conserved among strains of all 12 serotype reference strains harboring the spaA gene by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PCR products. These results indicates that SpaA is a common protective antigen of serotypes 1 and 2 of E. rhusiopathiae in swine and will be a useful tool for development of new types of vaccines and diagnostic tools for effective control of the disease...|$|E
40|$|In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), pigs {{are raised}} almost {{exclusively}} by smallholders either in periurban areas of major {{cities such as}} Kinshasa or in rural villages. Unfortunately, little information is available regarding pig production in the Western part of the DRC, wherefore a survey was carried out to characterize and compare 319 pig production systems in their management and feeding strategies, along a periurban - rural gradient in Western provinces of the DRC. Pig breeding was {{the main source of}} income (43 %) and half of respondent were active in mixed pig and crop production, mainly vegetable garden. Depending on the location, smallholders owned on average 18 pigs, including four sows. Piglet mortality rate varied from 9. 5 to 21. 8 % while average weaned age ranged between 2. 2 and 2. 8 months. The major causes of mortality reported by the farmers were African swine fever 98 %, <b>Swine</b> <b>erysipelas</b> (60 %), erysipelas trypanosomiasis (31 %), Swine worm infection (17 %), and diarrhoea (12 %). The majority of the pigs were reared in pens without free roaming and fed essentially with locally available by-products and forage plants whose nature varied according with the location of the farm. The pig production systems depended on the local environment; particularly in terms of workforces, herd structure and characteristics, production parameters, pig building materials, selling price and in feed resources. It can be concluded that an improvement of Congolese pig production systems should consider (1) a reduction of inbreeding, (2) an improvement in biosafety to reduce the incidence of African swine fever and the spread of other diseases, and (3) an improvement in feeding practices.

40|$|The {{specificities}} and sensitivities of five recombinant proteins of {{the surface}} protective antigen (SpaA) of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae were examined by {{indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) with the aim of developing a reliable serological test for the detection of protective antibody against E. rhusiopathiae. Fully mature protein and the N-terminal 416 amino acids (SpaA 416) showed sufficient antigenicities, and further examination was done with SpaA 416 because of its higher yield. The antibody titers of pigs experimentally immunized with commercial live vaccine and two types of inactivated vaccines clearly increased after immunization, and all pigs were completely protected against challenge with virulent strains. On the other hand, the antibody titers of nonimmunized control pigs remained very low until they were challenged, and all showed severe symptoms or subsequently died. Interference with the production of antibody against live vaccine by maternal antibody or porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus infection 1 week after vaccination was also clearly detected. Because the ELISA titer correlated well with the protection results, the specificity and sensitivity of the ELISA were further evaluated with sera collected from pigs reared on 1 farm on which animals had acute septicemia, 2 farms on which the animals were infected or free from infection, and 10 farms on which the animals were vaccinated with live vaccine, among others. The ELISA titers clearly revealed the conditions of the herds. These results indicate that the SpaA 416 ELISA is an effective method not only for evaluating pigs for the presence of protective antibody levels resulting from vaccination or maternal antibody but also for detecting antibody produced by natural infection. This test has important potential for the effective control of <b>swine</b> <b>erysipelas...</b>|$|E
