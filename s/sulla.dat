5|$|The Senate, now {{alarmed at}} the {{apparently}} unstoppable rebellion occurring within Italy, gave {{the task of}} putting down the rebellion to Marcus Licinius Crassus. Crassus {{was no stranger to}} Roman politics, or to military command as he had been a field commander under Lucius Cornelius <b>Sulla</b> during the second civil war between <b>Sulla</b> and the Marian faction in 82 BC, and had served under <b>Sulla</b> during the dictatorship that followed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} in which the populares party {{controlled}} the city, they flouted convention by re-electing Marius consul several times without observing the customary ten-year interval between offices. They also transgressed the established oligarchy by advancing unelected individuals to magisterial office, and by substituting magisterial edicts for popular legislation. <b>Sulla</b> soon made peace with Mithridates. In 83 BC, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and recaptured the city. <b>Sulla</b> and his supporters then slaughtered most of Marius' supporters. <b>Sulla,</b> having observed the violent results of radical popular reforms, was naturally conservative. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and by extension the senate. <b>Sulla</b> made himself dictator, passed a series of constitutional reforms, resigned the dictatorship, and served one last term as consul. He died in 78 BC.|$|E
5|$|Several years later, a {{new power}} had emerged in Asia. In 88 BC, a Roman army {{was sent to}} put down that power, king Mithridates VI of Pontus, but was defeated. Over the {{objections}} of the former Consul Gaius Marius, the Consul for the year, Lucius Cornelius <b>Sulla</b> was ordered by the senate to assume command of the war against Mithridates. Marius, {{a member of the}} democratic ("populare") party, had a Tribune revoke Sulla's command of the war against Mithridates, so <b>Sulla,</b> a member of the aristocratic ("optimate") party, brought his army back to Italy and marched on Rome. Marius fled, and his supporters either fled or were murdered by <b>Sulla.</b> <b>Sulla</b> had become so angry at Marius' Tribune that he passed a law that was intended to permanently weaken the Tribunate. He then returned to his war against Mithridates, and with <b>Sulla</b> gone, the populares under Marius and Lucius Cornelius Cinna soon took control of the city. The populare record was not one to be proud of, as they had reelected Marius Consul several times without observing the required ten-year interval. They also transgressed democracy by advancing un-elected individuals to magisterial office, and by substituting magisterial edicts for popular legislation. <b>Sulla</b> soon made peace with Mithridates, and in 83 BC, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and captured the city again. <b>Sulla</b> and his supporters then slaughtered most of Marius' supporters, although one such supporter, a 17-year-old populare (and the son-in-law of Cinna) named Julius Caesar, was ultimately spared.|$|E

5|$|In 77 BC, {{the senate}} sent one of <b>Sulla's</b> former lieutenants, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great"), {{to put down}} an {{uprising}} in Hispania. By 71 BC, Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission. Around the same time, another of <b>Sulla's</b> former lieutenants, Marcus Licinius Crassus, had just put down the Spartacus-led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return, Pompey and Crassus found the populares party fiercely attacking <b>Sulla's</b> constitution. They attempted to forge {{an agreement with the}} populares party. If both Pompey and Crassus were elected consul in 70 BC, they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of <b>Sulla's</b> constitution. The two were soon elected, and quickly dismantled most of <b>Sulla's</b> constitution.|$|R

5|$|When <b>Sulla</b> {{returned}} in 82BC, {{he was made}} dictator {{for the purpose of}} bringing order to the Republic's politics. <b>Sulla</b> attempted to concentrate political power into the Senate and the aristocratic assemblies, whilst trying to reduce the obstructive and legislative powers of the tribune and Plebeian council. However, his changes were not to last. With significant popular unrest, the tribunate's powers were quickly restored by 70BC. <b>Sulla</b> passed legislation to make it illegal to march on Rome as he had, but having just shown that doing so would bring no personal harm so long as one was victorious, this had little effect.|$|E
5|$|During his {{dictatorship}} from 82 BC until 80 BC, Lucius Cornelius <b>Sulla</b> {{restored the}} old Servian Organization to this assembly. <b>Sulla</b> died in 78 BC, and in 70 BC, the Consuls Pompey Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus repealed Sulla's constitutional reforms, including his {{restoration of the}} Servian Organization to this assembly. Thus, they restored the newer organization that had originated in 241 BC. The organization of the Centuriate Assembly was not changed again until its powers were all transferred to the Roman Senate by the first Roman Emperor, Augustus, {{after the fall of}} the Roman Republic in 27 BC.|$|E

5|$|The Yuezhi Kushan Empire in {{northern}} India largely guaranteed {{the security of}} Parthia's eastern border. Thus, from the mid-1st century BC onwards, the Arsacid court focused on securing the western border, primarily against Rome. A year following Mithridates II's subjugation of Armenia, Lucius Cornelius <b>Sulla,</b> the Roman proconsul of Cilicia, convened with the Parthian diplomat Orobazus at the Euphrates river. The two agreed that the river would serve as the border between Parthia and Rome, although several historians have argued that <b>Sulla</b> only had authority to communicate these terms back to Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} unrest {{reached its}} most serious state, however, {{in the two}} civil wars that were caused by the clash between generals Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius <b>Sulla</b> starting from 88 BC. In the Battle of the Colline Gate at the very door {{of the city of}} Rome, a Roman army under <b>Sulla</b> bested an army of the Marius supporters and entered the city. Sulla's actions marked a watershed in the willingness of Roman troops to wage war against one another that was {{to pave the way for}} the wars which ultimately overthrew the Republic, and caused the founding of the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|In 87 BC, Hybrida {{accompanied}} Lucius Cornelius <b>Sulla</b> into Greece {{either as}} a military tribune or as a legatus. Two years prior, in 89 BC, the Mithridatic Wars had begun due to a dispute between Mithridates VI of Pontus and Nicomedes III of Bithynia over the Roman province of Cappadocia. Mithridates invaded and conquered both Bithynia and Cappadocia {{before moving on to}} invade Roman Greece, which in turn spurred some of the city-states to rebel against Rome. At the time Rome was embroiled in internal conflict through the Social Wars from 91 to 88 BC and then almost immediately after, an uprising occurred in Rome which further delayed Sulla's response to Mithridates. After the rebellion in Rome was dealt with, <b>Sulla,</b> accompanied by Hybrida, marched on Greece to face the Mithridatic-Greek armies under the command of General Archelaus and Aristion. The First Mithridatic War continued from 86 to 83 BC. During this campaign, <b>Sulla</b> drove the Mithridatic and Greek armies back towards Athens before capturing it in 86 BC, invading Asia Minor the following year and then successfully forcing a peace with Mithridates in 83 BC. <b>Sulla</b> returned to Italia in 83 BC, leaving Lucullus to command forces in Asian and Hybrida to command a small cavalry force in Achaia. In Achaia, Hybrida levied contributions on the province, an offence for which he was prosecuted by the young Julius Caesar in 76 BC However, he refused to appear and succeeded in escaping punishment after appealing to the people's tribunes.|$|E

5000|$|The term {{started to}} get its modern {{negative}} meaning with Cornelius <b>Sulla's</b> ascension to the dictatorship following <b>Sulla's</b> second civil war, making himself the first Dictator {{in more than a}} century (during which the office was ostensibly abolished) as well as de facto eliminating the time limit and need of senatorial acclamation, although he avoided a major constitutional crisis by resigning the office after about one year, dying a few years later. Julius Caesar followed <b>Sulla's</b> example in 49 BC and in February 44 BC was proclaimed Dictator perpetuo, [...] "Dictator in perpetuity", officially doing away with any limitations on his power, which he kept until his assassination the following month.|$|R
5|$|The {{internal}} unrest {{reached its}} most serious {{stage in the}} two civil wars or marches upon Rome by the consul Lucius Cornelius <b>Sulla</b> {{at the beginning of}} 82 BC. In the Battle of the Colline Gate at the very door of the city of Rome, a Roman army under <b>Sulla</b> bested an army of the Roman senate and its Samnite allies. Whatever the merits of his grievances against those in power of the state, his actions marked a watershed of the willingness of Roman troops to wage war against one another that was {{to pave the way for}} the wars of the triumvirate, the overthrowing of the Senate as the de facto head of the Roman state, and the eventual endemic usurpation of power by contenders for the emperor-ship in the later Empire.|$|E
5|$|During the Kingdom, the Senate {{consisted}} of persons selected {{to the position}} by the King, a power which the consuls inherited {{after the end of}} the monarchy. In the very early republic, senators were primarily chosen due to their birth, but by the late Republic, and especially after <b>Sulla,</b> membership in the Senate became predicated on having previously held a magistracy. In the late 4th century BC, the consul's power to control Senate membership was transferred to the censor, exercised with considerable discretion, until laws passed in the late Republic formalised some kind of hearing before censorial decisions. In line with the censor's duty to protect morals, senators were required to be of good character, not have been found guilty of a criminal offence, and not be a person tainted with ignominy (e.g. bankrupts, former gladiators, prostitutes, or deserters). Before the time of Augustus, there is no evidence of any kind of property qualification. The Senate {{consisted of}} around 300 prior to the dictatorship of <b>Sulla,</b> but after his dictatorship, it consisted of somewhere over 500 men.|$|E
5|$|Mithridates the Great was {{the ruler}} of Pontus, a large kingdom in Asia Minor, from 120 to 63 BC. He is remembered as one of Rome's most {{formidable}} and successful enemies who engaged {{three of the most}} prominent generals of the late Roman Republic: <b>Sulla,</b> Lucullus, and Pompey the Great. In a pattern familiar from the Punic Wars, the Romans came into conflict with him after the two states' spheres of influence began to overlap. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom, and Rome for her part seemed equally keen for war and the spoils and prestige that it might bring. After conquering western Anatolia (modern Turkey) in 88 BC, Roman sources claim that Mithridates ordered the killing {{of the majority of the}} 80,000 Romans living there. In the subsequent First Mithridatic War, the Roman general Lucius Cornelius <b>Sulla</b> forced Mithridates out of Greece proper after the Battle of Chaeronea and later Battle of Orchomenus but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival Marius; consequently, Mithridates VI was defeated but not destroyed. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.|$|E
50|$|Mithridates' {{problems}} were {{further complicated by}} a 'rogue' Roman army dispatched by <b>Sulla's</b> enemies in Rome, commanded by Flaccus and then by Gaius Flavius Fimbria which crossed from Macedonia through Thrace to Byzantium and ravaged western Asian Minor before inflicting a defeat on the Pontic forces on the Rhyndacus river. This finally led Mithridates to accept <b>Sulla's</b> terms (Treaty of Dardanos).|$|R
50|$|<b>Sulla's</b> army took Athens on the Kalends of March, in the {{consulate}} of Marius and Cinna, February 12 86 BC. The siege of Athens {{was a long}} and brutal campaign, <b>Sulla's</b> rough battle hardened legions, veterans of the Social War thoroughly devastated the city. Athens had chosen the wrong side in this struggle, portrayed as a war of Greek freedom against Roman domination.|$|R
60|$|There {{was great}} fear at Rome, among {{the friends of}} Cinna and Marius, at the {{prospect}} of <b>Sulla's</b> return. A fire broke out in the Capitol, and this added to their terror, for the Books of the Sybil were burnt, and all her prophecies were lost. Cinna tried to oppose <b>Sulla's</b> landing, but was killed by his own soldiers at Brundusium.|$|R
5|$|Later populist {{attempts}} to introduce similarly broad-reaching redistributive legislation enlisted {{the support of}} Gaius Marius, a great general, which was then elected to a string of unprecedented consecutive consulships, which also violated Roman law, which mandated a decade between consulships, further weakening the primarily norms-based constitution. The {{attempts to}} recall the general <b>Sulla</b> led to his marching on Rome in 88BC, installing two new consuls and forcing major reforms of the constitution at sword-point, before leaving a campaign in the East. This further strengthened the precedent that the Republic's constitution was malleable.|$|E
5|$|Parthian {{enterprise}} in the West {{began in the}} time of Mithridates I and was revived by Mithridates II, who negotiated unsuccessfully with Lucius Cornelius <b>Sulla</b> for a RomanParthian alliance (c.105BC).* Mackay (2004), 149; Sherwin-White (1994), 262 When Lucullus invaded Southern Armenia and led an attack against Tigranes in 69BC, he corresponded with Phraates III to dissuade him from intervening. Although the Parthians remained neutral, Lucullus considered attacking them.* Sherwin-White (1994), 262–263 In 6665BC, Pompey reached agreement with Phraates, and RomanParthian troops invaded Armenia, but a dispute soon arose over the Euphrates boundary. Finally, Phraates asserted his control over Mesopotamia, except for the western district of Osroene, which became a Roman dependency.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sulla,</b> who had {{observed}} the violent results of radical populare reforms (in particular those under Marius and Cinna), was naturally conservative, {{and so his}} conservatism was more reactionary than it was visionary. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and thus the senate. After being appointed Roman Dictator in 82 BC, he enacted a series of constitutional reforms. He resigned the Dictatorship in 80 BC, retired in 79 BC, and died a year later. While he {{thought that he had}} firmly established aristocratic rule, his own career had illustrated the fatal weaknesses in the constitution. Ultimately, it was the army, and not the senate, which dictated the fortunes of the state.|$|E

50|$|Conflicts between populares and optimates {{also played}} a part in some of the civil wars of the late Roman Republic: <b>Sulla's</b> First Civil War (88-87 BC), <b>Sulla's</b> Second Civil War (82-81 BC), the Sertorian War (83-72 BC), Lepidus' Rebellion (77 BC), Caesar's Civil War (49-45 BC), the Post-Caesarian Civil War (44-43 BC), the Liberators' Civil War (44-42 BC), and the Sicilian Revolt (44-36 BC).|$|R
5|$|There {{were two}} {{extraordinary}} magistrates: the dictator and the magister equitum (literally: master of horse). Dictators were {{selected by the}} consuls to resolve some crisis threatening the republic, for a term of around six months, before {{they were expected to}} resign and return their powers to the ordinary magistrates. The magister equitum, was then appointed by the dictator as his lieutenant. The dictatorship was only used in the early and middle Republic, before falling out of fashion {{after the end of the}} Second Punic War, before being revived during the time of <b>Sulla</b> as an extraconstitutional measure, not to defeat some foe or quell unrest, but rather, to bring stability to the political order.|$|E
5|$|As consul he {{took part}} in a number of Senate debates. His first chance to shine in the Senate came in the dispute between ex-preator Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo and Lucius Cornelius <b>Sulla.</b> Cornelius failed to give his seat to Corbula at a gladiatorial show, and the {{incident}} sparked a debate between the rights of age and the defenders of tradition, in which Drusus argued a rapprochement. In another, it was proposed by Caecina Severus that the wives of governors be banned from joining their husbands in the provinces. Caecina delivered a speech in support of the bill, followed with speeches by both Valerius Messalinus and Drusus in opposition to it. The proposal was then abandoned, not because of the arguments made, but because of the intervention of an external force (the auctoritas of Drusus) the same reason for the later repeal of the Oppian law (lex Oppia).|$|E
5|$|In 88 BC, {{an aristocratic}} senator named Lucius Cornelius <b>Sulla</b> was elected Consul, and soon {{left for a}} war in the east. When a Tribune revoked Sulla's command of the war, <b>Sulla</b> brought his army back to Italy, marched on Rome, secured the city, and left for the east again. In 83 BC he {{returned}} to Rome, and captured the city a second time. In 82 BC, he made himself Dictator, and then used his status as Dictator to pass a series of constitutional reforms that were intended to strengthen the senate. In 80 BC he resigned his Dictatorship, and by 78 BC he was dead. While he thought that he had firmly established aristocratic rule, his own career had illustrated the fatal weakness in the constitution: that it was the army, and not the senate, which dictated the fortunes of the state. In 70 BC, the generals Pompey Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus were both elected Consul, and quickly dismantled Sulla's constitution. In 62 BC Pompey returned to Rome from battle in the east, and soon entered into an agreement with Julius Caesar. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, known as the First Triumvirate. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements were to be ratified, Crassus was to be promised a future Consulship, and Caesar was to be promised the Consulship in 59 BC, and then the governorship of Gaul (modern France) immediately afterwards. In 54 BC, violence began sweeping the city, and in 53 BC Crassus was killed. In January 49 BC, the senate passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the republic. In response, Caesar quickly crossed the Rubicon with his veteran army, and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the Consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece, and allowed Caesar to enter the city unopposed.|$|E
40|$|The {{approach}} Cicero {{takes in}} his defence of Sextus Roscius forces him to discuss recent political events, {{above all the}} proscriptions and <b>Sulla’s</b> position as dictator. This is a deliberate choice by Cicero, which does not prevent him from constructing an effective defence but allows him to combine that defence with the articulation of {{a vision for the}} Sullan res publica. This vision does not conflict with any of <b>Sulla’s</b> acts, but allows Cicero to argue that more work {{needs to be done to}} secure <b>Sulla’s</b> achievement and to suggest that he, despite his youth and lack of experience, can be part of the res publica towards which he and the jurors should work...|$|R
50|$|While home at {{his estate}} Julius meets his {{daughter}} Julia {{for the first}} time and learns of <b>Sulla's</b> assault on his wife. In his fury he comes close to killing Tubruk, one of his oldest friends, before learning Tubruk was <b>Sulla's</b> killer. Swearing revenge on <b>Sulla's</b> associates and followers, Julius publicly allies himself with Crassus and Pompey, who publicly denounces Cato as responsible for his daughters death. Tension also flares briefly between Julius and Brutus when Julius demands Brutus hand over Primigenia to him, until Brutus acquiesces and puts his friendship above his pride. Julius' marriage also suffers, with Cornelia feeling increasingly ignored by Julius. When Cato's son is forcibly signed up to Primigenia and is forbidden to withdraw from his service, Julius gathers another opponent.|$|R
