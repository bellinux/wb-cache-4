40|$|This paper {{describes}} a design space analysis approach towards a "complete " planning solution. A complete solution {{is defined as}} one containing the resultant plan, {{the context in which}} it applies, and the argument structure that justifies it. The focus in this paper is on defining and communicating the argument struc-ture component. A perspective of a plan as a spe-cialised type of design and planning as a <b>specialised</b> form of <b>design</b> <b>activity</b> is used. In doing so, research is drawn upon from the design rationale community for generating an explanation of a designed artifact. In particular, the method of generating a design space which represents the location of the plan within the space of possible plan elaborations is adopted. An ini-tial implementation, Nonlin+DR, is described and its potential benefits to stand-alone and mixed-initiative planning is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{design process}} can be {{considered}} as a series of design phases. Each design phase can be further divided into number of <b>design</b> <b>activities.</b> In the network of <b>design</b> <b>activities,</b> the <b>design</b> <b>activities</b> generate information which is used by the succeeding activities. Since importance of the input information available from different activities changes with respect to the requirement of the <b>design</b> <b>activities,</b> a pull system approach for the management of <b>design</b> <b>activities</b> is proposed. Due to the concurrent consideration of many factors in the design process, it is required that the <b>design</b> <b>activities</b> are performed by teams of experts. In addition to the multiple resource requirement, the uncertainty in the weights and duration of <b>design</b> <b>activities</b> makes the problem of scheduling <b>design</b> <b>activities</b> complex.

50|$|As cranes {{became more}} common in docks, and as ships became bigger, they also became more specialised. In 1927, Stothert & Pitt {{produced}} the first bulk-handling crane.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a scheme for representing <b>design</b> <b>activity,</b> called a Rich Picture, designed to assist inductive analysis. This Rich Picture combines different transcription schemes that capture both verbal and non-verbal aspects of the <b>design</b> <b>activity.</b> The transcriptions produced using these schemes are linked together and back to the <b>design</b> <b>activity</b> raw data, such as drawings, video and audio recordings, and workspace resources. In producing the Rich Picture the aim is not to prove that <b>design</b> <b>activity</b> is one thing or another, nor are the schemes intended as measures, nor are they intended as a means of reducing data to a manageable form (although they do enable selective review). Essentially, the transcriptions augment the <b>design</b> <b>activity</b> and together with this raw data comprise the Rich Picture which, it is argued, provides a powerful resource for interpretation and analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new transaction management scheme, LOT, for coordinating <b>design</b> <b>activities</b> in CAD Environments. Unlike the previous approaches for coordinating <b>design</b> <b>activities,</b> {{in which each}} designer faces complexity of a <b>design</b> <b>activity,</b> LOT encapsulates this complexity from designers. This is achieved by two notions: (1) transaction template that guides the designer not to produce incorrect design results due to misunderstanding of complex <b>design</b> <b>activities,</b> and (2) interleaving specification that enables the designer to cooperate with his/her group members in a consistent way. LOT also contains a new concurrency control scheme, called semantic concurrency control, which takes advantage of interleaving specification. In LOT, therefore, any designer {{does not need to}} know the details of the <b>design</b> <b>activity,</b> and also does not need to concern about the moment of release for his/ her intermediate results. Keywords: intelligent user interface, transaction template, interleaving spe [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to explore <b>design</b> <b>activities</b> such as <b>design</b> process and design information through protocol analysis of design sessions of expert designers and student designers and to understand the relations between their personal creativity characteristics and <b>design</b> <b>activities.</b> In protocol analysis, we instituted dual coding schemes based on design information and design process. Regarding design process, an adequate distribution of <b>design</b> <b>activities</b> in process may be necessary to bring out a good solution. It has been identified that design processes of expert designers are more effective than those of student designers. Regarding personal creativity, relatively widely different characteristics have been identified for the eight participants, and much of personal creativity traits can be associated with observed <b>design</b> <b>activities.</b> This suggests that personal creativity characteristics could be utilized in understanding <b>design</b> <b>activity</b> characteristics and such understanding could be helpful in improving individual or team-based design problem solving...|$|R
