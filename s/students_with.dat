Methods: Due to {{the uniqueness of the}} issue, a casuistry or a case study was chosen. Interviews, documentation analysis, questionnaires and observation were used for a data acquisition. Results: Results imply that a partial integration of a <b>student</b> <b>with</b> phocomelia is possible. It is always necessary to know the specifics of a physical disability. The output of our research represent lessons that the <b>student</b> <b>with</b> phocomelia took part in. Consequently, we found peer-tutoring, modified contents of education and a paralel individual education as a beneficial practice. These principles of adapted physical education had an effect of the <b>student's</b> cooperation <b>with</b> the class. They gave support to his empowerment as well. We also extended the <b>student's</b> experience <b>with</b> various physical activities that can variegate his free time activities.

This {{study was a}} qualitative study. The subjects {{of this study were}} the seventh grade students of Public Junior High School 16 Surakarta.

In Creative Thinking Ability Level 4, the student was able to solve a problem with more than one alternative answers.

A student belonged to Creative Thinking Ability Level 2 that was a male <b>student</b> <b>with</b> high motivation. In Creative Thinking Ability Level 2, the student was able to make one new answer (that could be made by other students in common thinking ability level).
