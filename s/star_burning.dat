60|$|The {{plague of}} the {{southern}} wind at the sounding of the third trumpet, was to cause a great <b>star,</b> <b>burning</b> as it were a lamp, to fall from heaven upon the rivers and fountains of waters, the Western Empire now divided into many kingdoms, and to turn them to wormwood and blood, and make them bitter. Accordingly Genseric, the King of the Vandals and Alans in Spain, A.C. 427, enter'd Africa with an army of eighty thousand men; where he invaded the Moors, and made war upon the Romans, both there and on the sea-coasts of Europe, for fifty years together, almost without intermission, taking Hippo A.C. 431, and Carthage the capital of Africa A.C. 439. In A.C. 455, with a numerous fleet and an army of three hundred thousand Vandals and Moors, he invaded Italy, took and plundered Rome, Naples, Capua, and many other cities; carrying thence their wealth with the flower of the people into Africa: and the next year, A.C. 456, he rent all Africa from the Empire, totally expelling the Romans. Then the Vandals invaded and took the Islands of the Mediterranean, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Ebusus, Majorca, Minorca, &c. and Ricimer besieged the Emperer Anthemius in Rome, took the city, and gave his soldiers the plunder, A.C. 472. The Visigoths {{about the same time}} drove the Romans out of Spain: and now the Western Emperor, the great star which fell from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, having by all these wars gradually lost almost all his dominions, was invaded, and conquered in one year by Odoacer King of the Heruli, A.C. 476. After this the Moors revolted A.C. 477, and weakned the Vandals by several wars, and took Mauritania from them. These wars continued till the Vandals were conquered by Belisarius, A.C. 534. and by all these wars Africa was almost depopulated, according to Procopius, who reckons that above five millions of men perished in them. When the Vandals first invaded Africa, that country was very populous, consisting of about 700 bishopricks, more than were in all France, Spain and Italy together: but by the wars between the Vandals, Romans and Moors, it was depopulated to that degree, that Procopius tells us, it was next to a miracle for a traveller to see a man.|$|E

40|$|For stars between 0. 8 - 8. 0 solar masses, {{nucleosynthesis}} enters {{its final}} phase during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stage. During this evolutionary period, grain condensation {{occurs in the}} stellar atmosphere, and the star experiences significant mass loss. The production of presolar grains can often be attributed to this unique stellar environment. A subset of presolar oxide grains features dramatic 18 O depletion that cannot {{be explained by the}} standard AGB <b>star</b> <b>burning</b> stages and dredge-up models. An extra mixing process, referred to as "cool bottom processing" (CBP), was proposed for low-mass AGB stars. The 18 O depletion observed within certain stellar environments and within presolar grain samples may result from the 18 O+p processes during CBP. We report here on a study of the 18 O(p,gamma) 19 F reaction at low energies. Based on our new results, we found that the resonance at Er = 95 keV (lab) has a negligible affect on the reaction rate at the temperatures associated with CBP. We also determined that the direct capture S-factor is almost a factor of 2 lower than the previously recommended value at low energies. An improved thermonuclear reaction rate for 18 O(p,gamma) 19 F is presented. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; to be published in Phys. Rev. ...|$|E
40|$|Just {{comparing}} {{with the}} scenario that the (3 + 1) -dimensional "real world" of the Calabi-Yau compactification {{has a tremendous}} landscape, we conjecture that a (4 + 1) -dimensional holographic theory may also hold a landscape of its vacua. Unlike the traditional studies of the AdS/CFT phenomenology where the vacua are always constructive, we discuss the proper holographic vacua and their flux compactification, starting from some general compact Einstein manifolds. The proper vacua should be restricted by (i) a consistent worldsheet theory that possesses the superconformal symmetry, (ii) some definite symmetries to keep/break the corresponding symmetries of the dual field theory, (iii) certain brane/flux configurations to cancel anomalies, and (iv) stabilities. We consider diverse fundamental parameters of the dual field theory, fixed by some special vacuum moduli. In an opposite way, if some field theory such as QCD holds an AdS dual, it may also possesses various fundamental parameters by an "landscape" of its vacuum. Different vacua may be adjacent with each other, and divided by domain walls. If {{the size of a}} single vacuum region is smaller than the visible universe, it may be testable. We discuss the consequences of this conjecture in the astrophysical environments, include but not limit to: (i) consistency with the critical energy density of the universe, (ii) the behaviors of cosmic rays, (iii) the stability and abundance of deuterons and other nuclei in the big-bang nucleosynthesis and the <b>star</b> <b>burning</b> scenarios, and (iv) the existence of strange/charm stars.

40|$|Stars {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} covered topics in introductory astronomy classes. From a constructivist framework, one must know what conceptions students bring with them to the classroom in order to effectively facilitate deep conceptual learning about stars. This study investigated the beliefs about stars that students hold when they enter an introductory astronomy course, and used that information to develop a concept inventory that can be used to assess those beliefs pre- and postinstruction. First, students' preinstructional beliefs were investigated through the use of student-supplied-response (SSR) surveys, which asked students to describe their ideas about topics such as what is a star, how is starlight created, how are stars formed, are all stars the same, and more. More than 2, 200 students participated in this portion of the study during four semesters. Responses were inductively analyzed in an iterative process and coded for themes. Calculated frequencies show that although many students (80 %) understand that stars are made of gas, a third to half of the participants (32 - 44 %, depending upon the question) believe that starlight is created (or energy otherwise emitted) as a result of the <b>star</b> <b>burning.</b> Nuclear fusion, the true energy source in stars, is identified by fewer than 10 % of the students. Interviews with seven volunteers confirmed that the responses seen on the SSR surveys were consistent with verbal explanations. The second portion of the study involved the design and testing of the Star Properties Concept Inventory. After item development and testing on Versions 1 and 2, interviews with 18 participants about their responses to Version 1, and an expert review by 26 volunteer astronomy instructors, Version 3 was created and tested during the Fall 2005 semester. Results from approximately 2, 000 students who took Version 3 show that those students in an introductory astronomy course for nonscience majors increased their scores significantly over the semester, whereas a control group (students in an introductory earth science course for nonscience majors) showed no increase. These results support the purpose of this concept inventory to investigate the effectiveness of instruction on the topic of star properties and formation...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} 605 days of {{photometric}} {{data from the}} Kepler spacecraft to study KIC 6614501, a close binary system with an orbital period of 0. 157 [*] 497 [*] 47 (25) days (3. 779 [*] 939 h), that consists of a low-mass subdwarf B (sdB) star and a white dwarf (WD). As seen in many other similar systems, the gravitational field of the WD produces an ellipsoidal deformation of the sdB which appears in the light curve as a modulation at two times the orbital frequency. The ellipsoidal deformation of the sdB implies that the system has a maximum inclination of ∼ 40 °, with i ≈ 20 ° being the most likely. The orbital radial velocity (RV) of the sdB star is high enough to produce a Doppler beaming effect with an amplitude of 432 ± 5 ppm, clearly visible in the folded light curve. The photometric amplitude that we obtain, K 1 = 85. 8 [*]km[*]s− 1, is ∼ 12 per cent less than the spectroscopic RV amplitude of 97. 2 ± 2. 0 [*]km[*]s− 1. The discrepancy {{is due to the}} photometric contamination from a close object at about 5 [*]arcsec north-west of KIC 6614501, which is difficult to remove. The atmospheric parameters of the sdB star, Teff = 23 [*] 700 ± 500 [*]K and log[*]g = 5. 70 ± 0. 10, imply that it is a rare object below the extreme horizontal branch (EHB), similar to HD 188112. The comparison with different evolutionary tracks suggests a mass between ∼ 0. 18 and ∼ 0. 25 M⊙, too low to sustain core helium burning. If the mass was close to 0. 18 – 0. 19 M⊙, the star could be already on the final He-core WD cooling track. A higher mass, up to ∼ 0. 25 [*]M⊙, would be compatible with a He-core WD progenitor undergoing a cooling phase in a H-shell flash loop. A third possibility, with a mass between ∼ 0. 32 and ∼ 0. 40 M⊙, cannot be excluded and would imply that the sdB is a ‘normal’ (but with an unusually low mass) EHB <b>star</b> <b>burning</b> He in its core. In all these different scenarios, the system is expected to merge in less than 3. 1 Gyr due to gravitational wave radiation. Fil: Silvotti, R [...] INAF.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{discuss the}} CM {{diagram of the}} galactic cluster NGC 2420 to the light of current {{theoretical}} predictions. By relying on the most recent updating of the physical input, one finds too luminous theoretical He <b>burning</b> <b>stars</b> together with the evidence for a misfitting of the lower portion of the MS. Moreover one finds two well known overshooting signatures, as given by i) the large extension of the “hook ” preceding the overall contraction gap, and ii) the scarcity of stars just {{at the end of}} the gap. We show that the overluminosity of He <b>burning</b> <b>stars</b> appears as a constant prediction of models based on updated physics, whereas alternative assumptions about the Equation of State can account for the MS fitting. Moreover, due to the scarse statistical significance of the observational sample, one finds that overshooting signatures can be present also in canonical (without overshooting) predictions. We conclude that, unfortunately, NGC 2420 does not keep the promise to be of help in costraining the actual dimensions of convective cores in H <b>burning</b> MS <b>stars,</b> suggesting in the meantime that using clumping He <b>burning</b> <b>stars</b> as theoretical standard candle is at least a risky procedure.
