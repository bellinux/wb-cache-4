5|$|The {{calls of}} {{throwing}} so infuriated Marsh {{that at the}} end of the day's play, he announced that he would wear <b>splints</b> when he was bowling the next day. Marsh took this action to ensure that his elbow was kept straight and to demonstrate that he could bowl fast without throwing. Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and the requisite <b>splints</b> and bandages were acquired from the nearby St. Vincent's Hospital, in order to bind his bowling arm. The hospital provided a medical certificate stating that Marsh could not move his elbow while encased in the <b>splints.</b> Marsh was proactive in attempting to defend the legitimacy of his bowling action. Marsh's intentions were published in the Sydney Morning Herald and Curran was made aware that Marsh would seek to challenge him.|$|E

5|$|Spasticity: {{spasticity}} {{is characterized}} by increased stiffness and slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of voluntary muscle power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful spasms of limbs. A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols is safe and effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, dantrolene, diazepam, and tizanidine. In the most complicated cases intrathecal injections of baclofen can be used. There are also palliative measures like castings, <b>splints</b> or customized seatings.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} demands {{of running a}} marathon every day took its toll on Fox's body. Apart from the rest days in Montreal taken {{at the request of}} the Cancer Society, he refused to take a day off, even on his 22nd birthday. He frequently suffered shin <b>splints</b> and an inflamed knee. He developed cysts on his stump and experienced dizzy spells. At one point, he suffered a soreness in his ankle that would not go away. Although he feared he had developed a stress fracture, he ran for three more days before seeking medical attention, and was then relieved to learn it was tendonitis and could be treated with painkillers. Fox rejected calls for him to seek regular medical checkups, and dismissed suggestions he was risking his future health.|$|E

40|$|A <b>splint</b> is {{required}} when teeth are mobile or {{need to be}} repositioned following a traumatic injury.

5|$|Halcombe {{grew up in}} South Australia, {{and studied}} at St Peter's College, Adelaide in his youth. There he earned the {{attention}} of cricket watchers for his skill and his suspect action. Halcombe was suspected of throwing, meaning an illegal bowling action in which a player straightens his arm {{in the process of}} delivering the ball, thereby throwing it, whereas the laws of cricket required that a bowler did not change the angle of his elbow in delivering the ball. In 1923, while still a schoolboy, he was observed by former England captain Archie MacLaren (who was currently visiting Australia as part of the Marylebone Cricket Club team) and former Australia captain and all rounder George Giffen. To test the legitimacy of Halcombe's action, his wrist, forearm and elbow were encased in <b>splints,</b> so that he could not move his elbow position. He delivered balls at varying speeds, and the experts failed to detect an illegal action.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into the}} Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales, Marsh first {{made an impression}} as a professional runner, travelling to Sydney and then competing interstate, winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler. While in Sydney, Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and his action quickly came under scrutiny. He was first no-balled for throwing in 1897, {{but it was not}} until 1900 that he came to prominence in a trial match against the New South Wales state team. Marsh dismissed leading Test cricketers Victor Trumper and Monty Noble, but was called for throwing. Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of his action by bowling with his arm encased in <b>splints,</b> which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation. Having topped the bowling averages in the local competition, Marsh was selected to make his debut in the Sheffield Shield. He made an immediate impression and led the first-class bowling averages for the season after three matches. He was no-balled in his second match by Bob Crockett, but things came to a head in his fourth match when the same umpire no-balled him seventeen times, leading to angry crowd demonstrations. The cricket community was divided on whether Marsh's action was fair and various theories were propounded, which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh. The most popular of these theories was that Marsh was scapegoated in a campaign against throwing and was a soft target because of his race.|$|E
25|$|Occlusal <b>splints</b> (also termed dental guards) are {{commonly}} prescribed, mainly by dentists and dental specialists, {{as a treatment}} for bruxism. Proponents of their use claim many benefits, however when the evidence is critically examined in systematic reviews of the topic, it is reported that there is insufficient evidence to show that occlusal <b>splints</b> are effective for sleep bruxism. Furthermore, occlusal <b>splints</b> are probably ineffective for awake bruxism, since they tend to be worn only during sleep. However, occlusal <b>splints</b> may be of some benefit in reducing the tooth wear that may accompany bruxism, but by mechanically protecting the teeth rather than reducing the bruxing activity itself. In a minority of cases, sleep bruxism may be made worse by an occlusal splint. Some patients will periodically return with <b>splints</b> with holes worn through them, either because the bruxism is aggravated, or unaffected by the presence of the splint. When tooth-to-tooth contact is possible through the holes in a splint, it is offering no protection against tooth wear and needs to be replaced.|$|E

40|$|Reduction of {{the amount}} of tooth roots which are {{embedded}} in their periodontium could cause tooth mobility. <b>Splinting</b> a weaker tooth with a more stable one, and using the principle of the multiple-root stabilization is one way to overcome tooth mobility. Temporary <b>splinting</b> aims to prevent pathological migration, restore masticatory function, stabilize teeth before/after surgery, and evaluate the prognosis of periodontal treatment. The use of intracoronal <b>splint</b> is still controversial because {{there are only a few}} studies that have evaluated the effect of <b>splinting</b> on periodontal health. We report two cases to evaluate the effect of intracoronal <b>splint</b> on periodontal treatment.

40|$|Aims and Objective: To {{find out}} and compare peri implant strain {{developed}} in four {{different types of}} implant supported prostheses i. e., cement retained <b>splinted,</b> cement retained non <b>splinted,</b> screw retained <b>splinted,</b> screw retained non <b>splinted.</b> Methodology: Four implant analogues were placed in a polyurethane mandibular model at the position of left and right first and second molar. Abutments were fixed to the implant at a torque of 25 Ncm. Two such models were made. Four different prostheses were placed on abutment of each model i. e screw retained <b>splinted,</b> screw retained nonsplinted, cement retained <b>splinted,</b> cement retained non <b>splinted.</b> Four strain gauges were attached on the model, two on the buccal and two on the lingual aspect of each implant. Static load of 400 N was applied on the prosthesis using universal testing machine. Load application was done ten times for each model and peri implant strain was measured. Results: The mean peri implant strain (±SD) generated {{was found to be}} highest in non-splinted screw retained (1397. 70 ± 44. 47 microstrains and 1265. 90 ± 42. 76 microstrains) and least in <b>splinted</b> cement retained (630. 70 ± 31. 98 microstrains and 519. 60 ± 32. 48 microstrains) in both 1 st and 2 nd molars respectively.

25|$|Occlusal <b>splints</b> {{are divided}} into partial or full-coverage <b>splints</b> {{according}} to whether they fit over {{some or all of}} the teeth. They are typically made of plastic (e.g. acrylic) and can be hard or soft. A lower appliance can be worn alone, or in combination with an upper appliance. Usually lower <b>splints</b> are better tolerated in people with a sensitive gag reflex. Another problem with wearing a splint can be stimulation of salivary flow, and for this reason some advise to start wearing the splint about 30 mins before going to bed so this does not lead to difficulty falling asleep. As an added measure for hypersensitive teeth in bruxism, desensitizing toothpastes (e.g. containing strontium chloride) can be applied initially inside the splint so the material is in contact with the teeth all night. This can be continued until there is only a normal level of sensitivity from the teeth, although it should be remembered that sensitivity to thermal stimuli is also a symptom of pulpitis, and may indicate the presence of tooth decay rather than merely hypersensitive teeth.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Internal <b>splinting</b> {{is defined}} as early tendon {{transfer}} performed during or just after nerve repair followingnerve injury and is a controversial issue. The objectivesof internal <b>splinting</b> are avoiding the use of long term external <b>splinting,</b> avoiding permanent hand deformities until the injured nerve is reinnervated and supporting sensorial recovery. In this paper we present our clinical cases of internal <b>splinting</b> and discuss the results in terms of indications, timing, advantages, and disadvantages of internal <b>splinting.</b> Materials and Methods: We applied internal <b>splinting</b> in 11 patients, 3 patients with radial nerve injury and 8 patients with ulnar nerve injury. Internal <b>splinting</b> was performed contemporarily with the nerve repair in 5 patients,in 2 weeks following nerve repair in 1 patient and in 4 weeks following nerve repair in 5 patients. Pronator teres was transferred to extensor carpi radialis brevis and flexor carpi radialis was transferred to extensor digitorum communis in radial nerve injuries. Omer’s superficial Y technique and its modification were used for ulnar nerve injuries. Results: Patients were followed up for at least 1 year with physical examination and electroneuromyelography and recovery of sensorial and motor functions were achieved in all of them. Conclusion: We concluded that internal <b>splinting</b> is usefulfor avoiding external <b>splint</b> usage and preventing the establishment of hand deformity until recovery of the nerve. The contribution of internal <b>splinting</b> to sensorial recovery was noteworthy {{as stated in the}} literature but the lack of control group and the small number of our cases was limited to come to a definite conclusion.
