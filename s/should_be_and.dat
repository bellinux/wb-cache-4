25|$|In the text, Milton conjectures {{about the}} {{formation}} of commonwealths. He {{comes up with a}} kind of constitutionalism but not an outright anti-monarchical argument. He gives a theory of how people come into commonwealths and come to elect kings. He explains what the role of a king <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> <b>and</b> conversely what a tyrant is, and why it is necessary to limit a ruler's power through laws and oaths.|$|E

Albanian newspapers were reprinted in Chinese newspapers and read on Chinese radio. Finally, Albania led the movement to give the People's Republic of China a seat on the UN Security Council, an effort which would prove successful in 1971 when it replaced the Republic of China's seat.|$|E

25|$|The main {{contributions}} of the model were firstly the initial question Ramsey posed on how much savings <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>and</b> secondly the method of analysis, the intertemporal maximisation (optimisation) of collective or individual utility by applying techniques of dynamic optimisation. Tjalling C. Koopmans and David Cass modified the Ramsey model incorporating the dynamic features of population growth at a steady rate and of Harrod-neutral technical progress again at a steady rate, giving birth to a model named the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model where the objective now is to maximise household's utility function.|$|E

25|$|With {{a common}} enemy, Guerrero began {{accompanying}} LayCool, interfering in their matches and favoring them in scripted booking decisions such as making herself the referee in McCool's Women's Championship rematch with James where {{she brought the}} title back to McCool. With James out of the picture, their lingering rivalry with Phoenix flared up when Phoenix saved Tiffany from a LayCool beatdown on March 12. The following week, Tiffany and Phoenix defeated LayCool in a standard tag match. This led to a 10 Diva Tag Team match at WrestleMania XXVI which LayCool helped win after Guerrero pinned Kelly Kelly with a Frog Splash. Phoenix gained revenge by defeating them again alongside Tiffany. On WWE Superstars, LayCool and Guerrero cut a promo in which they mocked Phoenix for not fitting their image of what a Diva <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> <b>and</b> Guerrero placed Phoenix in an 'intergender' match against Layla, which Phoenix won, despite heavy interfering from McCool and Guerrero. LayCool later gained a measure of revenge by defeating Phoenix and a briefly returned James, after which they taunted Phoenix's perceived bad looks by smothering her in make-up. At the Extreme Rules pay-per-view, McCool defended her Women's Championship against Phoenix in an Extreme Makeover match, where cosmetics products were legal as weapons. Phoenix won the title from McCool despite support from Layla and Guerrero.|$|E

25|$|In the {{simplest}} terms, collective memory {{can be understood}} as the memory of a group of people, and is usually associated with the passing of that memory from generation to generation. However, there are many nuances to this idea; it must also be considered in terms of the processes of remembering and forgetting events. Thus, when a typical emotional event is socially shared and propagates to perhaps 50 other people, that event becomes a collective memory for that group or community of people. When the emotional event is particularly intense, the event would be expected to undergo an even larger diffusion. Furthermore, the more intense the emotional event is, the more rapid the diffusion <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>and</b> should reach more people in a shorter amount of time. This is especially true for events that are shared via mass media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, internet, etc. In this case, the collective memory is no longer confined to a local population, but instead can become that of a regional, national, or even international population. Besides the propagation of a single person’s emotional event, many people can simultaneously experience a single national emotional event, such as the disappearing of an important person. Such an event also becomes part of a collectively shared memory. However, {{it must be noted that}} each person still has their own personal memory of the event, such as where they were when they experienced the event, what they were doing, etc.|$|E
500|$|The first Danish {{reviews of}} Andersen's 1835 tales {{appeared}} in 1836, and were hostile. Critics disliked the informal, chatty style, {{and the lack}} of morals, and offered Andersen no encouragement. One literary journal failed to mention the tales at all, while another advised Andersen not to waste his time writing [...] "wonder stories". He was told he [...] "lacked the usual form of that kind of poetry... and would not study models". [...] Andersen felt he was working against their preconceived notions of what a fairy tale <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>and</b> returned to writing novels, believing it to be his true calling.|$|E

It'll throw a million demons at you because it wants to, put in half a dozen arbitrary fights in a 30-foot stretch of map, force you to survive for ages on a tiny sliver of health... and then give you a D at the end of the level because you weren't doing enough combos." ...|$|E

The arch was reconstructed in 2015, and it was inaugurated on 28 April 2016. A coat-of-arm belonging to Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc was probably added to the arch looking towards Mdina after the restoration of the aqueduct by de Rohan, but no certainty can be established; this arm still exists and is located few metres away, close to St Joseph Tower (see below), attached to a wall outside the entrance of a police station.|$|E
