Furthermore, there was a belief that the diluted combined wastewater was not harmful to receiving waters, due to the natural dilution and self-purifying capacity of rivers, lakes and the sea. In the early 20th century a debate evolved between those who thought it was in the best interest of public health to construct wastewater treatment facilities and those who believed building them was unnecessary. Nevertheless, many cities began to opt for separate sewer systems, creating favorable conditions for adding wastewater treatment plants in the future.|$|E

The park created through this intervention reconnects the neighbourhood, 14 to its ecological structure and creates a neighbourhood amenity, attracting new investment interests; (2) building a neighbourhood transit node with limited bus way to downtown and commercial niche, which attracts new development and balances the needs of people, transit and cars; and (3) inserting distinct neighbourhood streets which act as armatures to focus the rehabilitation of existing apartments and the development of diverse new housing types. ...|$|R
40|$|Hydrological {{issues in}} metropolises in Taiwan have become {{increasingly}} important because the <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> <b>sewer</b> systems of metropolises are frequently unable {{to meet the requirements}} of the existing and future metropolitan development. Typhoons or torrential rains that cause rainfall intensities that exceed the designed capacity of storm water sewers can result in serious flooding. The losses caused by flooding can be reduced if the areas at risk of flooding can be predicted and warnings can be issued to prompt disaster prevention and allow response units and residents to prepare before disasters occur. The primary {{purpose of this study is}} to integrate the quantitative precipitation forecasting technologies [1, 2] developed by the Taiwan Typhoon and Flood Research Institute to establish a rapid, stable, real-time, and automatic metropolitan area flood estimation system for predictive flooding analysis. The objects of this study are metropolitan areas in Taiwan with <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> <b>sewer</b> systems. The standard capacities of <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> <b>sewer</b> systems throughout Taiwan and the geographic information system (GIS) shape files are collected and compiled.

40|$|Abstract. The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the efficiency of domestic Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) tank to reduce the inflow discharge to stormwater sewer systems, which intends to be an option to increase urban resilience to climate change impacts. A dimensionless methodology developed based on a water balance model at daily temporal scale was applied to determine both the obtainable water saving due to the use of rain water for toilet flushing (i. e. reduce the use of portable water) and meanwhile reduce stormwater volumes discharging to sewer systems by the tank storage. The methodology and a RWH tank system was evaluated applying the daily rainfall data obtained in two met-stations of Blindern in Oslo and Rygge in Fredrikstad, South Norway. Results show, for all the considered scenarios in the two case studies that the use of the rainwater storage tank can provide significant reduction of water volume discharges to the <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> <b>sewer,</b> accordingly the resulting damages during the extreme events will be reduced...|$|E
40|$|Pump {{failure is}} defined as the {{inability}} of the pump to pump at design capacity. In an urban drainage system failing pumps may result in sewer overflow and flooding. However, the system failure may be due to an unexpected rainfall event exceeding the overall design capacity of the pumps, or to the failure of one or more pumps being the inflow to the pumping station less than the design capacity. Here we propose a model that incorporates two stochastic models for (a) the storm water discharge and (b) the complex system functioning, into a tool for the <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> <b>sewer</b> reliability assessment. In our schematic stormwater sewer system a pipe network with storage capacity transfers water to the pumping station, and the pumping station discharges the incoming flow to a water body at higher level thanks to the interplay of a number of pumping units. The model may be used to evaluate the reliability of different design solution in order to define the design criteria that maximize the system service and minimize the realization costs...|$|E

40|$|The greater Los Angeles {{urban area}} {{is home to}} nearly 19 million people, but has local water {{resources}} that can only support a population of approximately one million. Los Angeles has always depended upon {{a large proportion of}} imported water, but severe droughts within the last three years have resulted in water shortages that have critical implications {{for the future of the}} city. In addition to these water supply issues, this thesis examines larger questions of scarcity, inequity and social justice that manifest themselves in the urban fabric of Los Angeles, a city that has the least amount of parks and public spaces of any major city in North America and has been rife with inequality, racism, poverty and crime. The term ‘metabolic rift’, refers to the division between humanity and nature, and the resultant ecological crises wrought by industrial capitalism. This concept can be expanded to include all manner of socio-ecological crises produced by processes of neoliberal global capitalism. The metabolic rift is a space of exclusion and subjugation, degradation and precarity, scarcity and toxicity—an expanding territory of perpetual crisis. In examining the evolution of the urban development of Los Angeles in the context of the production of metabolic rifts and increasingly critical water scarcity, this thesis correlates the production of a capital-driven urban fabric and the expanding network of hydrological infrastructures. In this, issues of sustainability, environmental and social justice, as well as critiques of late capitalism and nature-culture discourses are interrogated. To address issues of water scarcity, this thesis proposes a strategy of tapping into the <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> <b>sewer</b> network of Los Angeles, channelling this water, regarded as a waste product and a hazard, and transforming it into a resource. This water will be reclaimed through a network of constructed wetlands that perform a hybrid function as storm water management and water treatment infrastructure, as well as parks and public spaces. This design proposal also includes a mixed use development in Compton that incorporates housing, community programs and a constructed wetlands park. The ambition is propose a model that can be a robust and sustainable approach to water conservation and management, as well as a space of inclusion—a productive commons outside the territory of capitalism...|$|E

Due to differences in political and public attitudes towards sewage management and to the relative status of engineers versus scientists, London and San Francisco followed different processes in the development of municipal sewer systems. While London entertained a science-based approach that yielded innovative ideas in biological sewage treatment, San Francisco retained a traditional engineering approach that favored sewage conveyance over treatment. Though both cities eventually adopted similar combined sewer systems that have left challenging urban infrastructure planning legacies, London’s experimental methods a century ago provide a useful model for infrastructural problem-solving today, as planners attempt to accommodate growing urban populations with infrastructure solutions that achieve multiple public benefits.
