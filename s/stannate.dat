5|$|Before the 19th century, cobalt was {{predominantly}} {{used as a}} pigment. Since the Middle Ages, it {{has been}} used in the production of smalt, a blue colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of the roasted mineral smaltite, quartz and potassium carbonate, yielding a dark blue silicate glass which is finely ground after the production. Smalt was widely used for the coloration of glass and as pigment for paintings. In 1780, Sven Rinman discovered cobalt green, and in 1802 Louis Jacques Thénard discovered cobalt blue. Cobalt pigments such as cobalt blue (cobalt aluminate), cerulean blue (cobalt(II) <b>stannate),</b> various hues of cobalt green (a mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide), and cobalt violet (cobalt phosphate) are used as artist's pigments because of their superior chromatic stability.

[...] Dielectric resonators used in the 1960s, however, had very poor temperature coefficients, typically 500 times worse than a mechanical resonator made of invar, which led to instability of filter parameters. [...] Dielectric materials of the time with better temperature coefficients had too low a dielectric constant to be useful for space saving. [...] This changed with the introduction of ceramic resonators with very low temperature coefficients in the 1970s. [...] The first of these was from Massé and Pucel using barium tetratitanateO9 (Young et al., page 655) at Raytheon in 1972.

40|$|Because our limited {{fossil fuel}} {{reserves}} are being depleted while worldwide energy demands are increasing, an energy crisis has emerged. To mitigate the problem, one major {{approach is to}} design and discover new energy materials with superior cost-effectiveness and functionality. Along this line, this dissertation work presents a high-throughput, low temperature and solution-based, green synthesis and processing strategy to enable various nanostructured, metal and bi-metal <b>stannates</b> for future energy storage and harvesting applications. Specifically, a generic green synthesis route was developed by applying a room temperature, solution-based process for nanostructured copper and copper-zinc hydroxystannate [CuSn(OH) 6 (CuHS) and CuxZn 1 -xSn(OH) 6 (CZHS) ]. The hydroxystannate growth started from poorly crystalline, Sn-based aggregates as the intermediate growth building blocks in both metal and bi-metal cases. A complex, multi-stage self-assembly process was identified {{for the formation of}} hydroxystannate nanostructures in aqueous solution. The Cu 2 +: Zn 2 + precursor ratio was found to be an effective parameter to tune the final nanocrystal composition and growth kinetics. The Cu: Zn substitution ratio was modified in the final products by tuning Cu 2 +: Zn 2 + precursor ratios. A much faster growth rate was found with increasing Zn 2 + content. These influences likely originated from the ionic activity and character difference of Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + in the solution. On the other hand, a cationic surfactant, CTAB, was successfully used toconstruct the final hydroxystannate nanocrystal assemblies with different morphology and porosity. Due to the amphiphilic nature of cationic head groups, CTAB-organized micelles in aqueous solution guided the unique self-assembly of mesoporous spherical CZHS nanocrystals by consuming the Sn-based intermediate aggregates. A simple and mild post-thermal treatment of the hydroxystannates led to formation of a new class of amorphous and mesoporous CuSnO 3 (a-CS) and CuxZn 1 -xSnO 3 (CZS). These <b>stannates</b> displayed similar electrochemical reaction characteristics to those of crystalline SnO 2 -based Li ion battery anodes. Lithiation starting with reduction of <b>stannates</b> into freshly formed metal and Li 2 O, with SEI layer formation, would explain the irreversible capacity loss seen during the first couple of cycles. Cyclic voltammograms revealed an extra side reaction in the Cu-rich <b>stannates</b> at a higher potential than that of Li/Li+, which was likely due to the nanosized copper oxide. The extra reduction peak corresponding to reduction of ZnO was found in the Zn-rich <b>stannates,</b> suggesting extra electrochemical reactions after the phase segregation of the Zn-rich <b>stannates...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: A {{population}} based {{case-control study}} was conducted in a highly agricultural area in Italy to investigate the association between chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (CLLs) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), and subtypes, and exposure to pesticides in farming-animal breeding workers. METHODS: 187 cases of CLLs and NHLs and 977 population controls were interviewed on medical, residential, family, and occupational history. Detailed information was collected about cultivated crops and animals bred from subjects who worked in farming and animal breeding. Information on crop diseases and pesticides used (and their quantity and duration) was also obtained. A priori job-exposure matrices were applied when a crop disease was reported, estimating the most probable pesticide and, when possible, an estimate of the cumulative dose. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by unconditional logistic analysis with adjustment for relevant confounders in farmers who bred animals and in farmers alone, for the main crops, types of animals, and pesticides categories. First recall and then the matrices were used for defining exposure, as it affected CLLs and NHLs and then separately on CLLs and low grade NHLs. Finally, the dose-response was investigated for those pesticides which had shown some association. RESULTS: No variable under study was associated with work in farming alone. In farming and animal breeding, no crop or animal showed an association with CLLs and NHLs when adjusted by exposure during childhood to farming and animal breeding (an indicator of life in a farming and animal breeding environment before the age of 13, which behaved as an independent risk variable). A non-significant association was found with <b>stannates,</b> arsenates, phosphates, and dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) based on recall, and for <b>stannates,</b> arsenates, and DDT after the application of the matrices. When CLLs together with low grade NHLs were considered, the association with insecticides in general, carbamates, and phosphates became significant according to personal recall (ORs and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) 2. 46, 1. 07 - 5. 63; 3. 08, 1. 05 - 9. 00; 2. 97, 1. 28 - 6. 91, respectively). The application of the matrices also showed a risk of borderline significance for <b>stannates</b> and dithiocarbamates. A significant dose-response effect was found for phosphates (for logarithmic unit increase, OR 1. 17, 95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 57); a strong trend for <b>stannates</b> and carbamates did not reach significance. CONCLUSION: The association of CLLs and NHLs with work in farming-animal breeding is partially explained by exposure to pesticides-namely insecticides (carbamates, phosphates, and DDT) and stannates-possibly related to their use in animal breeding. The association is limited to cases of CLL and low grade NHL. The independent effect of the variable exposure during childhood suggests that early exposures, including possible contact with animals, may play a part in the pathogenic process of these neoplasms...|$|R
