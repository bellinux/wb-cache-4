500|$|After the 2009–10 {{season was}} over, {{there was much}} {{speculation}} over whether coveted free agents such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bosh would sign with new teams for the 2010–11 season. Bosh was active on the social media front, posting his thoughts on Twitter and having a documentary crew record his meetings with the teams interested in signing him. On July 10, 2010, Bosh officially completed a sign-and-trade deal with the Miami Heat, teaming up with Wade and James. Bosh's parting message to the Raptors on his website said, [...] "now that this was my toughest decision, mostly because Toronto has been <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> me. I've loved every minute here and I just {{wanted to thank you}} {{from the bottom of my}} heart..." [...] Not only did Bosh leave Toronto as its all-time leader in virtually all major statistical categories, he was one of only three players in the league who accrued 10,000 points, 4,500 rebounds, and 600 blocks in his seven seasons with the Raptors.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1999, Ms. Magazine {{published}} {{a series of}} articles by writer Susan Jane Gilman, sexologist Susie Bright, and author-host Abiola Abrams arguing from three generations of women whether Lewinsky's behavior had any meaning for feminism. [...] Also in 1999, Lewinsky declined to sign an autograph in an airport, saying, [...] "I'm kind of known for something that's not <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> be known for." [...] She made a cameo appearance as herself in two sketches during the May 8, 1999, episode of NBC's Saturday Night Live, a program that had lampooned her relationship with Clinton over the prior 16 months.|$|E
2500|$|The {{video was}} choreographed by Shawnette Heard and Marty Kudelka. It {{was the first}} time Jackson had not worked with Tina Landon since the Rhythm Nation era. The video's routine {{consisted}} of contemporary, jazz, and street dance styles. The dancers in the clip were intended to appear [...] "wild", in contrast to Jackson's more [...] "sedate" [...] appearance. [...] "It's kind of over-the-top trendy as far as the clothing", said Jackson. The video's stylist desired a Tokyo-influence in the wardrobe, exclaiming [...] "it's <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> pull clothes, and then put the clothes on her and have them become iconic because it's Janet." [...] The majority of the video was designed through CGI and chroma key. The clip is famous for its portrayal of futuristic technology and choreographed dance scenes set on a hovering platform. Jackson described the platform to be [...] "like a ride," [...] adding [...] "it tilts, slants, you can slide off or fall. I was literally airborne, it was lifting me right up." [...] The original scene was designed on a set, but was taken apart and replaced with a green screen. Kahn said [...] "that just put even more pressure on me, because I didn’t want to be the director that made the bad Janet Jackson video." [...] Throughout the dance sequence, scenes from Sega Dreamcast games Jet Grind Radio, Samba de Amigo, and Shenmue are shown in the background.|$|E
