40|$|Carabus hungaricus Fabricius, 1792 usually inhabits sandy grasslands and dolomitic grass-lands in Hungary. It {{is listed}} in the Habitat Directive {{and it is a}} {{characteristic}} species of the Pannonian biogeographic region. This paper summarizes all available data (literature data, personal communications, all available museum specimens, original research) on the current distribution of Carabus hungaricus in Hungary making use of GIS. The most numerous populations of this carabid beetle live in Pannonic <b>sand</b> <b>steppe</b> biotopes, the most vulnerable of the dolomitic grasslands. In Hungary, Carabus hungaricus is a vulnerable species according to the IUCN criteria. Known habitat types, habitat preferences, cooccurring ground beetle species, and endangering environmental factors are discussed...|$|E

50|$|The {{vegetation}} in {{the country}} consists of semi-desertic sagebrush species in the Nogai Steppe, which also has no vegetation in its <b>sand</b> dunes. Feather-grass <b>steppe</b> and chestnut species are found in black earth soils and in the Terek River and Sunzha River regions, with beech, hornbeam, and oak forming broad-leaved dense forests on the mountain slopes. Above 6,500 feet, the vegetation type changes to coniferous forests succeeded by alpine meadows at further higher elevations. Other plant species noted {{in the country}} are yew-trees, pine, apple, cherry, pear, berry, wild strawberry, and ramsons.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out at a dune slack meadow near Mórahalom town in the Southern part of the Great Hungarian Plain. The area of the {{grassland}} is approximately 840, 000 m 2. The vegetation is mosaic-like {{in accordance with the}} variable microrelief and water content. The lower part of the grassland consists of various types of saltmarshes and wet meadows and at the upper microrelief, Pannonic <b>sand</b> <b>steppe</b> patches occur. True bug assemblages were sampled at 16 patches using 5 × 50 sweeps at each sampling site. The sampling was repeated three times in both 2007 and 2008. The area, the perimeter, the shape index of the sampled patches as well as the diversity of the surrounding patches were assessed as “landscape parameters”. The plant species number and diversity of the sampled patches were estimated from the data of 5 × 5 m coenological quadrats. Altogether 66, 087 adult individuals belonging to 153 species were collected. The ordination methods showed that the true bug assemblages of the sampling patches differ from each other in accordance with the vegetation type. These assemblages differed in their species composition and diversity as well as in their assemblage structure. The results suggested that the vegetation type based on plant species composition determined the true bug assemblages...|$|E
40|$|At an Eastern Hungarian {{protected}} grassland, namely at the Lesser Mole Rat (Spalax leucodon Nordmann, 1840). Reservation of Hajdúbagos Nature Conservation Area, {{grazing animal}} husbandry formed the façade {{of the land}} for hundreds of years. Though, due to the unfavourable changes {{of the last few}} decades in this sector of agriculture, the primeval <b>sand</b> <b>steppe</b> meadow (Pulsatillo hungaricae-Festucetum rupicolae (Soó 1938) Borhidi 1996) plant association is endangered by the increasingly accelerating succession. To stop or at least to slow down this process the rehabilitation of the area could be necessary. The target of the restoration ecology actions is to restore the previously existing, more favourable natural status of a particular area. However, the lack of knowledge according to the conditions that refer to the original circumstances often complicates this activity. To define these reference conditions the exploration of the history of a certain landscape is very important as restoration is only successful if the restored ecosystem is similar to the original. We examined the land use changes of the research area during the last 250 years according to historical and present geographical databases using GIS technology and completed this work with the study of archival data. By our results we stated that these examinations are crucial in the proper - agriculture related - management of protected areas...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Timber-oriented forest {{management}} {{has an important}} impact on biodiversity in forest ecosystems. Recovery dynamics of two groups of beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae, Staphylinidae) were studied after reforestation with native English oak (Quercus robur). We expected that reforestation with heavy site preparation causes {{a shift in the}} diversity of surface-dwelling beetles in early phases of reforestation. Moreover, we tested the habitat specialist hypothesis, assuming that diversity of forest specialist species will be lower in early phases with open canopy than later phases of reforestation after the canopy closure. Materials and methods: We compared litter sifter samples among mature (130 -year-old) oak forest, and recently established (5 -year-old), young (15 -year-old), middle-aged (45 -year-old) reforestations. Results: Our results showed that diversity of ground beetles was the highest in the recently established reforestation, while it was the lowest in the mature oak forest. Contrarily, diversity of rove beetles was the lowest in recently established reforestation and it was the highest in the mature oak forest. In agreement with the habitat specialist hypothesis, the diversity of forest specialists of both taxa was lower in the recently established reforestation than in the young and middle-aged reforestations as well as mature forest. Discussion: Our results suggested that clear-cutting of mature forest, site preparation before reforestation and cultivation by light tilling in early phases of reforestation have detrimental effects on forest specialist rove beetles and ground beetles. However, reforestation with native species could be a feasible management method in pannonic mesophile <b>sand</b> <b>steppe,</b> because forest specialist species can recover after the canopy closure. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} found tree species in arid areas of northeast Asia. To understand the morphological and physiological characteristics of Siberian elms in arid regions, we analyzed leaves from seven study sites (five arid or semi-arid and two mesic) in China, Mongolia and the Republic of Korea, which covered a wide range of average annual precipitation (232 mm·year− 1 to 1304 mm·year− 1) under various aridity indexes (AI) and four different microenvironments: <b>sand</b> dune, <b>steppe,</b> riverside and forest. The traits of Siberian elms varied widely along different annual precipitation (P) and AI gradients. Tree height (H), leaf size (LS) and stomatal area per unit leaf area (AS/AL) decreased with increasing AI, whereas leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA) and water-use efficiency (WUE) increased significantly. In addition, trees at the five arid sites showed significant differences in LS, LMA and AS/AL but not in H and WUE. Thus, our study indicated that indigenous Siberian elm trees in arid areas have substantially altered their morphological and physiological characteristics to avoid heat stress and increase water conservation in comparison to mesic areas. However, their changes differed depending on the surrounding microenvironment even in arid areas. Trees in sand dunes had a smaller LS, higher LMA, thicker leaf cuticle layer and higher stomatal density and AS than those in steppes and near a riverside...|$|R
5000|$|Hamsters {{are found}} in the wild {{throughout}} Europe and Asia and are considered to be extremely adaptable, living in scrublands, <b>sand</b> dunes, desert <b>steppes</b> and farmlands.The land where the Turkish hamster lives is extremely dry and open, with fairly little vegetation aside from grasses. [...] Turkish hamsters usually live between 1,000 and 2,200 meters above sea level. [...] This hamster burrows in the ground for shelter, and its burrows can be 20 inches to 6 feet below the ground surface. [...] These burrows are complex, consisting of several tunnels leading to separate cells for nesting, food, and waste. [...] Turkish hamster burrows are well-enough equipped for the hamsters to hibernate for four to 10 months (though sources do differ on this point), sometimes sleeping for 30 days at a time, though usually waking weekly {{for a day or two}} of activity.|$|R

References to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (abbreviated as ICN) are provided according to its Melbourne edition (McNeill et al. 2012). The psammophilous species Allium savranicum “Besser ” is confined to sandy steppes and pine forests on riverine <b>sands</b> in the <b>steppe</b> and forest-steppe zones of the Ukraine and southwestern Russia (Omelchuk-Myakushko 1979). It was distinguished from the Crimean endemic A. marschallianum Vvedensky (1935 : 184) in the length of pedicels, the colour of tepals and anthers (Omelchuk-Myakushko 1979, Seregin 2012). This species is accepted {{in a number of}} recent standard works (Omelchuk-Myakushko 1979, Czerepanov 1995, Mosyakin & Fedoronchuk 1999, Sagalaev 2006) but its name is deemed to be not validly published by Besser (Gregory et al. 1998). Most of the authors who treated A. savranicum stated that this name was published by Wilibald Swibert von Besser (1784 – 1842) in a supplement to the Catalogue of plants cultivated in the botanical garden in Krzemieniec, due in 1818, although nobody has seen the original publication yet (Vvedensky 1935, Omelchuk-Myakushko 1979).

40|$|Locations in {{southern}} Iberia were sampled to assess {{patterns in the}} distributions and diversities of land molluscs and {{to determine the effects}} of habitat structure on diversity at differing scales. In Part One of the study 91 sites, each 1 km, were sampled. Species with higher abundances were present at more sites than those with lower abundances. Low levels of similarity were found between the land mollusc communities. The monthly mean of sunshine hours per day during the wet period and the annual mean absolute humidity provided the best explanation of the species data. The results suggest that the heterogeneous habitats from the region allow a large number of mollusc species to co-exist in varied communities possibly controlled by historical and regional factors including climate and geology. In Part Two of the study 60 sites, each 1600 m 2, were sampled. Twenty sites were located in each of three habitat types (<b>sand,</b> <b>steppe</b> and garigue), and for each habitat type ten sites were sampled in both the wet period and dry period. Diversities and habitat structure were assessed at 1 m, 5 m and 20 m. There were differences in the number of species, abundances and diversities between habitats, and between the wet and dry periods at each habitat. Increasing heterogeneity and complexity increased the number of species, but not their abundances. Components of habitat structure affected the number of species and abundances independently of the total complexity. Relationships between heterogeneity, complexity, number of species and species diversity were scale-dependent with most of the statistically significant relationships between these occurring at lm 2. Increases in abundances and number of species with increasing area support the passive sampling model and the area per se hypothesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|We have {{researched}} the population dynamics of Brachyiulus jawlowskii Lohmander, 1928 {{in the arena}} of the Dnepr river (within the "Dnieper-Orilsky” Nature Reserve) and also present a full picture of the habitat distribution of Julidae within the researched area. The tested models were basic types of arena biogeocenosis: <b>sand</b> <b>steppe,</b> black maple forests, artificial pine plantations, deciduous forest, meadow and swamp. Variation in population density of B. jawlowskii is determined by biotopical features. The swamp and meadow habitats can be characterized by the highest level of population dynamics. B. jawlowskii plays the greatest role in the herpetobiont grouping in swamp and oak forest habitats (6. 7 % and 4. 6 % respectively). In other types of habitat this species composes 0. 1 – 3. 5 % of the total abundance of this group. The highest abundance dynamic was reached by the Julidae cenopopulations which inhabit the swamp, oak forest and meadow habitats. B. jawlowskii occupies a relatively significant share in the herpetobiont communities of these habitats. Thus, the indicators of absolute number of this species and its relative participation in the herpertobiont grouping indicate the preference of this species for marsh, oak forest and meadow habitats. These habitats can be characterized by an excessive or moderate level of edaphotopic humidification. The ecosystem of the steppe zone of Ukraine is subject to significant human impact. In nature reserves, this effect is minimized, which permits research to be conducted on regimes of natural population dynamics. We established that B. jawlowskii inhabits all habitats investigated within the arena zone of the Dnepr river. This indicates that this is an environmentally flexible Julidae species. The population dynamics of B. jawlowskii can be characterized by three distinct periods: spring-summer, summer and autumn. Each of these periods is characterized by a distinct population dynamic, but throughout the study period the metapopulation of B. jawlowskii remained stable. This is due to the redistribution of representatives of the biotopical metapopulation over a wide range. The conservation regime within the "Dnieper-Orilsky" Nature Reserve had a positively effect {{on the state of the}} B. jawlowskii population. Within the reserve on the territory of the arena of the Dnepr river B. jawlowskii uses a wide variety of types of habitats...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the global}} land use and climate change, endangerment of natural {{vegetation}} is in-creasing. That is why the threatening factors were documented in details during the MÉTA mapping. We have documented the impacts of water management, land use (management of woodlands and grasslands), the invasive species, urbanisation, habitat fragmentation and the neighbourhood, as well. In the present article (1) we evaluate the actual state of the habitats by the 28 threat types documented during the MÉTA mapping; (2) we introduce 12 newly developed indicators, which were applied for the semi-quantitative comparison of the overall degree of endangerment of the Hungarian habitats. Based on the summarisation of our results the most seriously endangered habitats in Hungary are as follows: <b>sand</b> and loess <b>steppe</b> oak woodlands (M 2, M 4, L 2 x), tussock sedge communities (B 4), extensive orchards (P 7), closed lowland oak woodlands (L 5, L 6), wa-ter-fringing and fen tall herb communities (D 5), wooded pastures (P 45), vegetation of loess cliffs (I 2), rich fens and Molinia meadows (D 1, D 2), Cynosurion grasslands and Nardus swards (E 34), swamp woodlands (J 2), xero-mesophilous grasslands (H 4) and salt steppe oak woodlands (M 3). The least endangered types are the rocky habitats (I 4, LY 3, H 1, G 2, M 7), certain halophytic (F 1 a, F 5, F 1 b, F 2, B 6) and aquatic habitats (A 23, A 3 a, A 1), open acidophilous woodlands (L 4 b), dry shrub vegetation with Crataegus and Prunus spinosa (P 2 b) and the beech woodlands (K 5).
