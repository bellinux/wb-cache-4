40|$|In {{this thesis}} we derive {{mathematical}} {{models for the}} <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> redraw process {{for the production of}} very thin <b>glass</b> <b>sheets.</b> In the redraw process, a prefabricated glass block is fed into a furnace, where it is heated and stretched by the application of draw rollers to reduce its thickness. Redrawn sheets may be used in various applications including smartphone and battery technology. Our aims are to investigate the factors determining the final thickness profile of a <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> produced by this process, as well as the growth of out-of-plane deformations in the sheet during redraw. Our method is to model the <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> using NavierâStokes equations and free-surface conditions, and exploit small aspect ratios in the sheet to simplify and solve these equations using asymptotic expansions. We first consider a simple two-dimensional sheet to determine which physical effects should be taken into account in modelling the redraw process. Next, we derive a mathematical model for redraw of a thin threedimensional sheet. We consider the limits in which the heater zone is either short or long compared with the sheet half-width. The resulting reduced models predict the thickness profile of the redrawn sheet and the initial shape required to redraw a product of uniform thickness. We then derive mathematical models for buckling of thin viscous sheets during redraw. For buckling of a two-dimensional <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> due to gravity-induced compression, we predict the evolution of the centreline and investigate the early- and late-time behaviour of the system. For a three-dimensional <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> undergoing redraw, we use numerical solutions to investigate the behaviour of the sheet mid-surface. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Total {{emissivity}} of <b>glass</b> <b>sheets</b> {{varies with}} <b>sheet</b> thickness since <b>glass</b> is a semitransparent material. The total hemispherical emissivity, eh, of fused-silica and soda-lime <b>glass</b> <b>sheets</b> of different thicknesses {{was measured by}} a transient calorimetric technique previously proposed. The measured eh values are arranged together with those of borosilicate <b>glass</b> <b>sheets</b> reported in our previous work. The eh values obtained for various sheets are expressed as functions of sheet thickness and temperature. Further, the eh values are compared with other published data obtained by experiments and theory, and discussed. An edge effect caused by the temperature distribution on the specimen surface, is clarified and the error involved in the eh values measured by the transient calorimetric technique, is estimated. In addition, another edge effect caused by the distribution on the local total hemispherical emissivity on the specimen surface is made clear. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of {{high quality}} <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> has allowed for many technologies to advance to astonishing frontiers. With dimensions reaching ~ 3 x 3 m², <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> is pushing the envelope for producing massive size flat panel displays that can be hung on walls like paintings. Many other applications utilize <b>sheet</b> <b>glass,</b> such as the hard disk drive industry for making platters, the x-ray telescope industry for making high precision optics, and the semiconductor industry for making masks and substrates. The exceptional optical qualities of <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> give them a leading advantage in many technologies; however, one main impediment that remains with manufacturing larger sheets is their surface waviness. The sheets have large warps, {{on the order of}} hundreds of microns, that present many challenges in all the industries utilizing such sheets, especially in the liquid crystal display and precision optics industries. The thinner the sheets, the larger their waviness, thus placing a limit on the minimum thickness {{that can be used in}} such applications before surface distortions become unacceptable. A novel method of shaping <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> is presented. This method reduces the surface waviness of a <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> and changes its shape while it is in its hot state and without contacting its surface. A <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass</b> is inserted between two parallel porous mandrels such that it is at a predefined distance from the two. A thin layer of pressurized gas flows through each mandrel and out against the glass surfaces. The resulting viscous flow against the heated soft <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> changes its surface topography. By using flat mandrels and controlled pressurized gas at temperatures close to 600 °C, the outcome is a flat <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass</b> with its original immaculate optical qualities. The flow in porous mandrels and the resulting pressure distribution along the surfaces of a <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> inserted between two porous mandrels is modeled. The design and manufacturing of an apparatus used to reduce the surface waviness of <b>glass</b> <b>sheets</b> at elevated temperatures is described. (cont.) The apparatus designed addresses individual sheets; however, guidelines on how to incorporate this method of shaping glass in a continuous <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> manufacturing facility are provided. A method of rigidly assembling stacks of <b>glass</b> and silicon <b>sheets</b> with precision for x-ray telescope mirrors and gratings is also presented. by Mireille Akilian. Thesis (Ph. D.)

50|$|The {{long strip}} of {{holographic}} film was placed between the loose <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> {{and the front}} of the camera, and the entire camera box was then almost filled with Johnson's Baby Oil. This unusual element to the high tech array of equipment and processes came about after the exhaustive testing of the refractive index of countless varieties of commercially available oils, and to the surprise of the holographers concerned, none could surpass the efficacy of this product. The function of the oil inside the camera was to act as an agent to cause the camera to flatten the film between the two glass surfaces. As the oil slowly seeped out between the film's surface and the two <b>glass</b> <b>sheets</b> the natural viscosity of the oil maintained an ultra-thin but cohesive layer that had the effect of gradually pulling the two <b>glass</b> <b>sheets</b> together with a level of force sufficient to flatten the film to within the tolerance level that allowed a consistent interference pattern to be recorded on the H1 master.|$|R

A two-dimensional {{finite element model}} with plane deformation assumptions is developed. Using the P 1 -Approximation, the formulation and numerical resolution of the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) are performed on the glass domain as it changes over time to estimate the flux of the radiative body at each position in the glass.
