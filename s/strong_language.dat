The site was soon restored {{within a few days}} with updated information, including the official ESRB rating of Mature 17+ for blood and gore, drug reference, intense violence, and <b>strong</b> <b>language.</b> Other ratings were released later from the BBFC and the ACB, which gave Saw an 18+ and a MA15+ rating respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{language of the}} region is Mayali, a dialect of Bininj Gun-Wok traditionally associated with the region surrounding Maningrida, in Western Arnhem Land. As it is a <b>strong</b> <b>language</b> with hundreds of speakers and {{a high rate of}} child acquisition, members of the Wagiman ethnic group gradually ceased teaching the Wagiman language to their children. As a result, many Wagiman people speak Mayali, while only a handful of elders, possibly no more than six, speak Wagiman.|$|E

5|$|The Blu-ray and DVD were {{released}} on October 29, 2007, in the United Kingdom, on October 31 in Hungary, November 20 in the United States, and December 12 in Australia. The DVD topped rental and sales charts in its opening week of release in the U.S. and Canada. There is an unrated version, which retains {{much of the}} original 'R-rated' dialogue, and a theatrical version of the film. However, the unrated version has a branching error resulted {{in one of the}} unrated changes to be omitted. The film briefly switches to the PG-13 version in the airbag scene; McClane's <b>strong</b> <b>language</b> is missing from this sequence (although international DVD releases of the unrated version are unaffected). The Blu-ray release features the PG-13 theatrical cut which runs at 128 minutes, while the Collector's Edition DVD includes both the unrated and theatrical versions. Time magazine's Richard Corliss named it one of the Top 10 DVDs of 2007, ranking it at #10.|$|E
5|$|Tomb Raider was {{released}} as scheduled on 5 March 2013 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. However, it {{was released}} early in Australia, being available on 1 March 2013.

Unlike the previous installments that received a T rating, Tomb Raider is the first game in the series to receive an M rating by the ESRB, due to blood and gore, intense violence and <b>strong</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hearing gunfire in the distance, Hinton, {{wanting to}} assist in the defence of the Allied positions, went to the {{headquarters}} of Brigadier Leonard Parrington, the officer in command of the evacuation. Hinton vehemently protested, in <b>strong</b> <b>language,</b> an order from Parrington to surrender. On being threatened with a court-martial for speaking to a senior officer in such a manner, he issued his own threat of proceedings against Parrington for defeatist talk and then left to determine for himself the situation. Other men of the reinforcement battalion were making preparations to move into the town and face the Germans. In the meantime, Hinton had collected his own party of 12 soldiers and led them into the town but came under fire. Ignoring an order from a nearby officer to retreat, he rushed forward to the nearest enemy gun and, hurling two grenades, killed the crew. He continued towards the town's waterfront, clearing out two light machine-gun nests and a mortar with grenades, then dealt with the garrison of a house where some of the enemy were sheltering. He then assisted in the capture of an artillery piece, but shortly after was shot in the stomach, immobilised and captured, one of about 6,000 Allied soldiers made a prisoner of war (POW).|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{examined}} the interactions between Mandarin and English in Mandarin-speaking English language learners. In my preliminary study (Cheng, Yamashita, 2 ̆ 6 Kan, 2015), a group of Mandarin-speaking English learners (n = 32) were tested with a two-stage cross-linguistic priming test. The results showed that participants responded to the English words that were previously presented in their <b>stronger</b> <b>language</b> (in Mandarin; L 1). The findings suggested that priming in a <b>stronger</b> <b>language</b> affects the subsequent processing in a speaker’s weaker language. In this study, I further examined the cross-linguistic priming effects across various priming conditions. There were four experiments in this study: In Experiment 1, a cross-linguistic non-masked priming task {{was used to examine}} the priming effect of the L 2 on L 1 processing in Mandarin-English bilinguals. In Experiment 2, I compared the results of Experiment 1 to the results of Cheng et al. (2015). The focus was on whether a cross-linguistic non-masked priming effect held if participants were primed in their L 2 (i. e., English) and completed the lexical decision task in their L 1 (i. e., Mandarin). In Experiment 3, a cross-linguistic masked priming task was used to test a priming effects of the weaker <b>language</b> on the <b>stronger</b> <b>language</b> in Mandarin-English bilinguals. In Experiment 4, by comparing the results of Experiments 1 and 3, I examined whether differences in performance across the cross-linguistic tasks were due to differences in the non-masked and masked priming tasks. The results of Experiment 1 showed a priming effect of speakers’ weaker <b>language</b> on their <b>stronger</b> <b>language.</b> A comparison to Cheng et al. 2 ̆ 7 s (2015) results showed that different priming directions were not significantly influential on participants 2 ̆ 7 response accuracy, but did influence reaction times (Experiment 2). The results of Experiment 3 showed a masked priming effect of the weaker <b>language</b> on the <b>stronger</b> <b>language.</b> Comparing Experiment 1 and Experiment 3, I found that the different types of priming tasks did not significantly affect participants 2 ̆ 7 performance differently (Experiment 4). This study provides additional information about the language interactions in bilinguals who speak Mandarin and English...|$|R

25|$|Mommsen was a {{delegate}} to the Prussian House of Representatives from 186366 and again from 187379, and {{delegate to the}} Reichstag from 1881–1884, at first for the liberal German Progress Party (Deutsche Fortschrittspartei), later for the National Liberal Party, and finally for the Secessionists. He was very concerned with questions about academic and educational policies and held national positions. Although he had supported German Unification, he was disappointed with {{the politics of the}} German Empire and he was quite pessimistic about its future. Mommsen strongly disagreed with Otto von Bismarck about social policies in 1881, advising collaboration between Liberals and Social Democrats and using such <b>strong</b> <b>language</b> that he narrowly avoided prosecution.|$|E
25|$|In July 2009, Disney XD {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the series, though it was quickly moved from prime time to late night airings, and only episodes from Seasons 1 to 3 are aired, mainly because those episodes are more appropriate for young viewers and does not contain as many mature themes, sexual content and <b>strong</b> <b>language</b> as later episodes. But in August 2010, Disney XD stopped airing the show.
