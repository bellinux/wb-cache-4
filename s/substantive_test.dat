40|$|This study compares various audit {{judgments}} and decisions between internal auditors (IAs) and external auditors (EAs). The study found {{the following four}} similarities: (1) When an unfavorable change occurred in the operating effectiveness of internal controls, both IAs and EAs significantly increased {{the extent of their}} detailed <b>substantive</b> <b>testing.</b> (2) In determining the extent of their detailed <b>substantive</b> <b>tests,</b> generally {{there was no significant difference}} between the IAs' and the EAs' levels of audit risk (AR) or detection risk (DR). (3) For both auditors, (a) there was some weak evidence which showed that their level of DR had a significant impact of the extent of their detailed <b>substantive</b> <b>testing,</b> (b) there was no evidence which showed that tolerable misstatement (TM) or need to control audit costs (AC) had a significant impact on the extent of their detailed <b>substantive</b> <b>testing,</b> and (c) there was strong evidence which showed that the change in their DR level had a significant impact on the change in the extent of their detailed <b>substantive</b> <b>testing.</b> (4) The overall statistical comparisons of the degree of consensus among IAs versus EAs showed an equal level of consensus between the two. ^ The study found the following eight differences: (1) When a favorable change occurred in the operating effectiveness of the internal controls, the IAs significantly decreased the extent of their detailed <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> but the EAs did not. (2) When an unfavorable change occurred in the analytical procedures signal, the EAs significantly increased the extent of their detailed <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> but the IAs did not. (3) When a favorable change occurred in the analytical procedures signal, the EAs significantly decreased the extent of their detailed <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> but the IAs did not. (4) In determining their acceptable level of AR, EAs give significantly greater consideration to AC than IAs. (5) The IAs' TM amounts were significantly lower than the EAs'. (6) The relative importance of the change in the level of DR in the determination of the change in the extent of detailed <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> was significantly higher for the EAs than the IAs. (7) The quantity of the IAs' audit hours was significantly greater than that of the EAs. (8) There was significantly more consensus among EAs than IAs concerning both audit hours and DR levels, but the opposite for TM amounts. ...|$|R
50|$|Detection Risk (DR) is {{the risk}} that the auditor will not detect a {{misstatement}} that exists in an assertion that could be material (significant), either individually or when aggregated with other misstatements. In other words, the chance that the auditor will not find material misstatements relating to an assertion in the Financial statements through <b>substantive</b> <b>test</b> and analysis. Detection risk results in the auditor's conclusion that no material errors are present where in fact there are. It is a component of audit risk.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Substantive</b> <b>test</b> of transactions: {{evaluate}} the client’s recording of transactions by verifying the monetary amounts of transactions, {{a process called}} substantive tests of transactions. For example, the auditor might use computer software to compare the unit selling price on duplicate sales invoices with an electronic file of approved prices {{as a test of}} the accuracy objective for sales transactions. Like the test of control in the preceding paragraph, this test satisfies the accuracy transaction-related audit objective for sales. For the sake of efficiency, auditors often perform tests of controls and substantive tests of transactions at the same time.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{implementation}} of Regulation 139/2004 and the turn towards a more effects-based approach to EU competition law, EU merger control was governed by EEC Regulation 4064/89. Under EEC Regulation 4064/89 (the 'old' regulation), a merger or concentration was prohibited if it would"create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would significantly impeded".The old <b>substantive</b> <b>test</b> is said to have encouraged two alternative interpretations of how to apply the test. The alternative interpretations suggest that, the presence of dominance alone is a sufficient condition to satisfy the dominance test and that as part of a two-tier test dominance is a necessary condition to satisfy before considering the dynamics of competition between the parties merging and the competitive characteristics of the market following the notification of a merger. The effective of the old [...] "dominance test" [...] increasingly began to be called into question with concerns regarding the issues of overenforcement and the false positives. The case of Airtours v Commission in 2002 served as the case that ultimately urged the Commission to recommend a change in EU merger regulation. The Commission prohibited the merger of Airtours and First Choice on the basis that it would create a collective dominant position in the market since there would be an incentive for the remaining firms in an oligopolistic market to restrict market capacity, leading to higher prices and increased profits as a result of subsequent market conditions following the merger. The oligopolists need not always [...] "behave as if there were one or more explicit agreements between them." [...] The Commission believed it was [...] "sufficient that the merger makes it rational for the oligopolists...to act individually in ways which will substantially reduce competition between them." [...] In the case of Airtours v Commission, the Court of First Instance annulled the Commission's decision to prohibit the Airtours-First Choice merger {{on the grounds that the}} Commission's interpretation of collective dominance was not informed by the widely recognised indicator of anti-competitive behaviour in an oligopolistic market - tacit collusion. The Airtours legal action created a significant level of uncertainty in EU merger law as a perceived gap had arisen with the law at the time - the gap of the non-collusive oligopoly.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} internal audit outsourcing and internal audit’s involvement in consulting on external auditors’ reliance {{on the work of}} internal audit. We test whether these factors influence (i) reliance on internal audit work already undertaken and (ii) the use of internal auditors as assistants. In each case, we distinguish between control evaluation and <b>substantive</b> <b>testing.</b> We find that involvement in consulting impacts reliance on work undertaken and the use of internal auditors as assistants for control evaluation. External auditors make greater use of internal auditors as assistants for <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> when internal audit is provided in-house. Overall, external auditors use internal audit more for control evaluation tasks than for <b>substantive</b> <b>testing.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|EU merger {{regulations}} {{rely on the}} “significant {{impediment to}} effective competition ” <b>substantive</b> <b>test.</b> However, the clause that incorporates these tests is not clear regarding implementation criteria. As a result, in many cases assessment and decisions about Mergers and Acquisitions are adopted in an uncertain legal context. Often this situation is justified for two reasons: first, the need to incorporate the economic complexity into the decision; and second, the prospective nature of merger assessment. Nevertheless, {{from the perspective of}} Law many questions arise. Prospective decisions are unsuitable to deal with classic theories of regulation and judicial review. As we explain in this paper, the European Commission adopts its decision based on the foreseeable behaviour of an undertaking. European Courts recognize the Commission’s ample discretion to assess merger on a case-by-case basis and limit the scope of judicial review. As a result, commentators have criticized the EC merger regulation. In this paper these issues are considered. In the first part, we study the clause that incorporates the <b>substantive</b> <b>test</b> in EC merger regulation.

This study examines the presence of IB during the performance of <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> and proposes two distinct interventions. Each intervention is predicted to improve auditor fraud detection. In a scenario involving fraudulent revenue transactions, findings show that a slight modification to the standard audit procedures significantly improves an auditor’s detection of red flags indicative of fraud.

Overall, the results suggest that audit firms should consider making a cost effective adjustment to their standard audit program to improve fraud detection...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore whether {{internal}} audit’s reporting relationship with the audit committee and the client’s business risk environment impact external auditors’ reliance on the work of internal audit. Design/methodology/approach – An experiment is conducted using a 2 £ 2 between-subjects design where we manipulate the above two factors at strong and weak levels. Participants are 66 audit partners, managers and seniors, all experienced with clients having internal audit functions. Findings – The results indicate that both factors affect external auditors’ reliance on work already undertaken by internal audit and their use of internal auditors (IA) as assistants. The results also indicate that external auditors are more likely to use internal audit for control evaluation tasks than for <b>substantive</b> <b>tests</b> of balances. The study does not find any significant interaction effects between the two factors. Originality/value – No prior studies have examined the influence of reporting relationship and client business risk on external auditors’ reliance decisions in the current governance environment. Further, the paper examines the impact of these factors on reliance on work already undertaken by internal audit and on using IA as assistants, with respect to both control evaluation work and <b>substantive</b> <b>testing</b> of balances. ...|$|R
