5|$|Alright, <b>Still</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> debut studio album by English {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Lily Allen, released on 13 July 2006 by Regal Recordings. After being rejected by several labels, Allen signed to London Records, who eventually {{lost interest in}} Allen, leading her to meet production duo Future Cut and sign to Regal Recordings. Recording for the album began in 2004 with sessions between Allen and Future Cut, and Allen's work garnered publicity on the Internet as she posted demos to her Myspace account before they were officially released. Allen later travelled to the United States to work with Greg Kurstin and Mark Ronson, to complete the final half of the album in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium and its compounds, a program was initiated in 1952 at the Material Testing Reactor, Arco, Idaho, US. It resulted in preparation of an eight-gram plutonium-239 target {{and in the}} first production of macroscopic quantities (0.6micrograms) of berkelium by Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thompson in 1958, after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years. This irradiation method was and <b>still</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only way of producing weighable amounts of the element, and most solid-state studies of berkelium have been conducted on microgram or submicrogram-sized samples.|$|E

25|$|After the {{collapse}} of the OPEC-administered pricing system in 1985, and a short-lived experiment with netback pricing, oil-exporting countries adopted a market-linked pricing mechanism. First adopted by PEMEX in 1986, market-linked pricing was widely accepted, and by 1988 became and <b>still</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> main method for pricing crude oil in international trade. The current reference, or pricing markers, are Brent, WTI, and Dubai/Oman.|$|E

25|$|The uniform was and <b>still</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> strongest {{suggestion}} of a military Scouting. Baden-Powell gave three reasons for the uniform: the boys like it, it gives a group feeling and it covers differences in wealth. The first reason he explains as giving the boys a direct connection to their heroes, so {{as part of the}} theatrical side of the Scouting game. However, in reality, most of those heroes did not wear uniforms.|$|E

25|$|Although {{it offers}} many {{incidents}} from {{the lives of}} many prophets, the Qur'an focuses with special narrative and rhetorical emphasis on the careers of the first four of these five major prophets. Of all the figures before Muhammad, Moses is referred to most frequently in the Qur'an. As for the fifth, the Qur'an is frequently addressed directly to Muhammad, and it often discusses situations encountered by him. Direct use of his name in the text, however, is rare. Rarer <b>still</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> mention of Muhammad's contemporaries.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the port}} {{was the primary}} source of income and {{employment}} for the city, especially right after 1974. However, it gradually lost some of its importance is the economy as the share of its employees in the population of Famagusta diminished due to various reasons. However, it <b>still</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> primary port for commerce in Northern Cyprus, with more than half of ships that came to Northern Cyprus in 2013 coming to Famagusta. It is the second most popular seaport for passengers, after Kyrenia, with around 20,000 passengers using the port in 2013.|$|E

25|$|At {{the present}} time, most {{countries}} in which Christianity is {{the religion of the}} majority of the people, are either secular states or they embrace the separation of Church and State in another way. (A list of {{countries in which}} Christianity <b>still</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> state religion can be found at the article on State religion.) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered as religious persecution. Among these, there is the case of the Hue Vesak shootings in Vietnam on May 8, 1963 and the ethnic cleansing of Albanians, most of them Muslim, in Kosovo between 1992 and 1999, along with Bosnian Muslims.|$|E
25|$|Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion is a {{structural}} isomer of Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion. Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion {{is not as}} strong as Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion, but it <b>still</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> second strongest superbase. Like Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion, Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion exists in the gas state, contrary to the other bases and superbase which exist in the solution state. In Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion, the two negatively charged ethynyl (C2H2-) groups are bonded to the first and third carbon atoms of the benzene ring. But in Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion, the ethynyl groups are bonded to the first and second carbon atoms of the benzene ring. Like Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion, Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion has no known use.|$|E
25|$|There are, though, many {{variations}} on the theme and many surprising aspects. For one thing, salticids do not necessarily follow a straight path in approaching prey. They may follow a circuitous course, sometimes even a course that takes the hunter through regions from which the prey is not visible. Such complex adaptive behaviour is hard to reconcile with an organism that has such a tiny brain, but some jumping spiders, in particular some species of Portia, can negotiate long detours from one bush down to the ground, then up the stem of another bush to capture a prey item on a particular leaf. Such behaviour <b>still</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> subject of research.|$|E
