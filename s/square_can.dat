2500|$|Because a rook's graph is perfect, {{the number}} of colors needed in any {{coloring}} of the graph is just {{the size of its}} largest clique. The cliques of a rook's graph are the subsets of its rows and columns, and the largest of these have size , so this is also the chromatic number of the graph. An -coloring of an [...] rook's graph may be interpreted as a Latin square: it describes a way of filling the rows and columns of an [...] grid with [...] different values {{in such a way that}} the same value does not appear twice in any row or column. Although finding an optimal coloring of a rook's graph is straightforward, it is NP-complete to determine whether a partial coloring can be extended to a coloring of the whole graph (this problem is called precoloring extension). Equivalently, it is NP-complete to determine whether a partial Latin <b>square</b> <b>can</b> be completed to a full Latin square.|$|E
2500|$|Warnecke's {{reputation}} as a world-class architect received a substantial boost {{when he was asked}} by the administration of President John F. Kennedy to save the historic buildings surrounding Lafayette Square. The controversy over Lafayette <b>Square</b> <b>can</b> be traced back to 1900, when the United States Congress passed a resolution establishing the U.S. Senate Park Commission (also known as the [...] "McMillan Commission" [...] because it was chaired by Senator James McMillan ]-). The Park Commission's proposals, which {{came to be known as}} the [...] "McMillan Plan," [...] proposed that all the buildings around Lafayette Square be razed and replaced by tall, Neoclassical buildings clad in white marble for use by executive branch agencies. Little action was taken on these proposals over the next five decades. However, plans were made in the late 1950s to raze all the buildings on the east side of Lafayette Square and replace them with a white modernist office building which would house judicial offices. Opposition to the demolition of the Cutts-Madison House and other buildings on Lafayette Square began forming shortly after the decision to raze the structures was announced. The newly elected Kennedy administration indicated in February 1961 that it was anxious to retain the existing historic homes on Lafayette Square.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is clear}} that if one permits similarities, any two squares in the plane become {{equivalent}} even without further subdivision. This motivates restricting one's attention to the group SA2 of area-preserving affine transformations. Since the area is preserved, any paradoxical decomposition of a square {{with respect to this}} group would be counterintuitive for the same reasons as the Banach–Tarski decomposition of a ball. In fact, the group SA2 contains as a subgroup the special linear group SL(2,R), which in its turn contains the free group F2 with two generators as a subgroup. This makes it plausible that the proof of Banach–Tarski paradox can be imitated in the plane. The main difficulty here {{lies in the fact that}} the unit square is not invariant under the action of the linear group SL(2, R), hence one cannot simply transfer a paradoxical decomposition from the group to the square, as in the third step of the above proof of the Banach–Tarski paradox. Moreover, the fixed points of the group present difficulties (for example, the origin is fixed under all linear transformations). This is why von Neumann used the larger group SA2 including the translations, and he constructed a paradoxical decomposition of the unit square with respect to the enlarged group (in 1929). Applying the Banach–Tarski method, the paradox for the <b>square</b> <b>can</b> be strengthened as follows: ...|$|E

She was still strong in her {{combinations}}, but they were combinations that had the vicious error of being formed {{for the benefit of}} the minority, and which, like the mimic fortresses and moats of a scenic representation, needed only a strong light to destroy the illusion. The alarm with which the patricians heard the shouts of the fishermen, as they swept by the different palaces, on their way to the great <b>square,</b> <b>can</b> be readily imagined. Some feared that the final consummation of their artificial condition, which had so long been anticipated by a secret political instinct, was at length arrived, and began to bethink them of the savest means of providing for their own security. Some listened in admiration, for habit had so far mastered dulness, as to have created a species of identity between the state and far more durable things, and they believed that St. Mark had gained a victory, in that decline, which was never exactly intelligible to their apathetic capacities. But a few, and these were the spirits that accumulated all the national good which was vulgarly and falsely ascribed to the system itself, intuitively comprehended the danger, with a just appreciation of its magnitude, as well as of the means to avoid it.|$|E
