40|$|An {{assessment}} of suspended sediment transport during storm events in two urban subtropical catchments (namely Caloundra nad Caboolture catchments) in the Pumicestone Region, Australia, was undertaken. The effectiveness of two instream sediment control devices (namely a Continuous Deflective System and an instream wetland) in treating these suspended sediments during storms was also examined. Influences from variables other than instantaneous <b>storm</b> <b>discharge</b> {{were shown to}} have a considerable influence on suspended sediment concentrations during storms, in both catchments. This reflected the varying responses of organic sediments, inorganic sediments and specific particle sizes during storms, and influences of sediment availability. First flush and exhaustion of sediments was observed within most storms within the Caloundra catchment and an exahustion of available sediments between storms {{as a result of}} successive storm activity, was also observed in this catchment. An exahustion of organic and inorganic sediments {{at the beginning of a}} wet period was seen for the Caboolture catchment and this suggests an influence of antecedent conditions of sediment availability and transport in this catchment. Moreover suspended sediment transport processes were shown to be similar to those found in temperate catchments, though a greater influence of variables not related to instatntaneous <b>storm</b> <b>discharge</b> was implied. The majority of sediments transported were volatile organic and fine inorganic sediments, for both catchments. Treatment of these suspended sediments by either the CDS or the instream wetland was not observed in general. The lack of treatment was consistent with a range of storms and this prevented an overall {{assessment of}} storm loading pressures on treatment during storms. However inflow <b>storm</b> <b>discharge</b> was shown to influence the exportation of sediments from the instream wetland. Whilst the retention of some coarse particles by the CDS and instream wetland was observed during some storms, neither treatment device was shown to have a positive effect on concentrations of fine sediments during storms.

40|$|Abstract. We studied <b>storm</b> <b>discharges</b> of nitrate and {{dissolved}} and particulate {{forms of}} ammonium, organic N, phosphate, and organic P from four adjacent small watersheds of differing land {{use on the}} Atlantic Coastal Plain in Maryland. We used V-notch weirs and automated storm samplers to measure discharges and collect samples at flow intervals during 76 storms. The watershed aquifers are perched on an impervious clay layer slightly above sea level, so that combined groundwater and surface water discharges were measured at the weirs. The concentrations of particulate forms of organic N (PON), organic P (POP), and inorganic P (PPi) increased up to 3 orders of magnitude during storm events and usually peaked prior to the peak water discharge, while concentrations of dissolved forms of organic N (DON), organic P (DOP), inorganic P (DPi), and nitrate did not change very much. Dissolved and particulate ammonium (DNH 4 and PNH 4, respectively) concentrations increased up to fivefold in storm events but remained low compared to other N forms. The watershed with the most cropland discharged the highest concentrations of total N, PON, DNH 4, nitrate, POP, and PPi. A forested watershed discharged the highest concentrations of DON, PNH 4, and DOP. The watershed with the most grazed land discharged the highest concentration of DPi. PON and POP were the dominant forms of N and P in <b>storm</b> <b>discharges</b> from all watersheds. Concentrations of nitrogen were higher in spring and summer storms than in winter storms, but phosphorus concentrations were much higher in the summer storms than in spring or winter.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Sept. 26, 2014 - March 26, 2015 We examined the spatial and temporal variability of stream carbon dioxide (CO₂) and the drivers of these variations in a headwater catchment. To examine temporal variation and drivers, we measured stream and hyporheic pCO₂ at high temporal resolution over 11 months in a 95. 9 -ha forested headwater catchment in the Western Cascades of Central Oregon, USA. Stream and hyporheic pCO₂ showed high seasonal and event-scale variability with distinct stream and hyporheic dynamics during <b>storm</b> <b>discharge</b> events. Hyporheic exchange flow exported 37. 5 kg-C yr⁻¹ per watershed hectare (confidence interval 4. 0 - 122. 3 kg-C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) from the riparian zone to the stream. Summing CO₂ evasion and downstream advection suggests that one third of inorganic carbon export originated in the hyporheic zone. Hyporheic exchange flow had greatest influence over stream pCO₂ during low and high baseflow, while CO₂ evasion had greatest influence during <b>storm</b> <b>discharge</b> events. These {{findings suggest that the}} hyporheic zone actively participates in carbon cycling in this headwater stream and continuously replenishes stream CO₂. To examine spatial variation and drivers, we measured stream CO₂ at monthly intervals from July 2013 through July 2014 at 38 locations across the 6400 -ha HJ Andrews Experimental Forest. Stream pCO₂ was consistently supersaturated with respect to atmospheric concentrations. Stream pCO₂ ranged from atmospheric (400 μatm) to 20 times atmospheric concentrations (8150 μatm) and exhibited strong spatial and temporal variability. The distribution of pCO₂ over the study period was different in small and large streams within the drainage network. At the watershed scale, pCO₂ decreased with distance downstream. At the reach scale, we did not detect clear patterns in the downstream direction. However, individual transects displayed persistent profile shape, with consistent high and low pCO₂ locations. We found negative relationships between stream pCO₂ and stream discharge, mean velocity and the carbon dioxide gas transfer velocity. Stream pCO₂ exhibited changes over short distances, with large changes in pCO₂ over less than 50 m. Longitudinal variability indicates spatial variability of in-stream controls on pCO₂ at this scale. Stream pCO₂ shows generally higher concentrations during the summer and lower concentrations in the winter, with considerable intrannual variability...|$|E

Three of these streams drained logged watersheds, and two drained reference deciduous forest watersheds. Litter inputs to the streams draining disturbed watersheds {{were significantly lower}} than to reference streams. Additionally, while undisturbed litterfall consisted primarily of relatively refractory leaf species, litterfall in the disturbed watersheds was composed of more labile leaf material. Non-woody benthic organic material was generally lower in disturbed streams than in reference streams, and woody benthic material was substantially lower in disturbed streams. Particulate organic matter transport was measured intensively during storms. These data were used in a computer model to estimate annual particulate organic matter transport. The model was driven by empirical equations relating particulate concentration to {{the rate of increase}} in flow during storms, time since peak <b>storm</b> <b>discharge,</b> and average baseflow concentation.

Using a sediment delivery ratio of 0.5 only for the connected landslide and landing failures and 1.0 for stream bank failures, the sediment load delivered to these streams during the 1995 storm was estimated for the Opitonui at ~ 12, 331  t (~ 8.0  t ha− 1) and for the Awaroa at ~ 15, 516  t (~ 13  t ha− 1) (from Additional file 5).

40|$|The {{runoff from}} blanket {{peatland}} catchments {{tends to be}} dominated by flashy stormflows. However, it is not known whether changes in vegetation cover influence the nature of stormflow hydrographs from blanket peatlands. This is important since degraded peatlands are of concern to restoration bodies who seek to understand the wider impacts of restoration investment on ecosystem services. This paper tests the hypothesis that peak flows are significantly higher and lag times shorter at the catchment scale when blanket peat vegetation cover is reduced. Storm hydrograph data from the 1950 s to the present day are analysed from a blanket peat catchment in northern England. The proportion of the catchment that was vegetated appears to have declined between the early 1950 s and mid 1970 s and then increased again to the present day. The changes in the proportion of bare peat over the catchment are coincident with changes in storm hydrographs. Hydrographs were significantly peakier with higher peaks per unit of rainfall (0. 40 m 3 mm− 1 compared with 0. 27 m 3 mm− 1) and narrower hydrograph shapes during the more eroded periods in the catchment and less so as the site has revegetated.

This resulted in substantial changes in channel morphology, sediment deposition and compositionu, and also to the macro invertebrate population suggesting that the slope-area gauging may have been affected by a debris flow. Additionally, harvesting had yet to begin in the Weiti catchment while a significant proportion of the total sediment load within Owera catchment was likely derived from cutover since ~ 30 % of the catchment area had been harvested before the March 1995 storm.|$|R
