40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that active structural acoustic control of complex structural/acoustic coupling can be numerically modeled using finite element and boundary element techniques {{in conjunction with}} an optimization procedure to calculate control force amplitudes. Appreciable noise reduction is obtained when the structure is excited at a <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> {{of the outer shell}} or an acoustic resonance of the inner cavity. Adding ring stiffeners as a connection between the inner and outer shells provides an additional structural transmission path to the interior cavity and coupled the modal behavior of the inner and outer shells. For the case of excitation at the <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> of the unstiffened outer shell, adding the stiffeners raises the <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> frequencies. The effectiveness of the control forces is reduced due to the off resonance structural response. For excitation at an acoustic cavity resonance, the controller effectiveness is enhanced...|$|E

SAS performance predicted {{on the basis of these}} tests is compared with flight data obtained from three lifting body vehicles and the X- 15 research airplane. Limit cycle and <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> test criteria, based upon ground and flight experience and data, were successfully applied to these vehicles.

40|$|Aerodynamic and <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> of {{an elastic}} airfoil {{in a uniform}} stream with {{oncoming}} vortices was investigated experimentally and numerically. An experiment was designed to create two parallel rows of vortices that serve as external excitation for the symmetric airfoil (NACA 0012). The vortices were produced by two identical side-by-side circular cylinders of diameter D in a uniform stream located at a fixed distance ahead of the airfoil. The whole arrangement was placed symmetrically about the midplane in the test section of a wind tunnel. Reynolds numbers ranging from ∼ 8 × 10 4 to ∼ 2 × 10 5 were selected because the Strouhal number was essentially constant in this range. A range of D was selected to provide a corresponding range of shedding frequencies f s {{that could lead to}} both aerodynamic and <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> of the airfoil. A hot-wire anemometer and a dual-beam laser vibrometer were used to measure the wake pattern and the vortex convection velocity, and the airfoil response, respectively. The airfoil displacement amplitude at <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> increases by many fold compared to its value far away from resonance and the airfoil goes into a limit-cycle oscillation behavior. As D decreases, near-aerodynamic resonance is also observed. These results were used to verify a boundary element method (BEM) developed to treat vortex-airfoil interaction problems. Aerodynamic and <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> of an elastic airfoil in a uniform stream with oncoming vortices was correctly replicated by the BEM, thus showing that the BEM model is appropriate for fluid-structure interaction problems.

40|$|The sound {{transmission}} loss of double {{walls in the}} low-frequency range is studied by means of structure-acoustic finite element analysis. The analysis simulates standard experiments to determine {{sound transmission}} loss of walls. The model is {{a detailed description of}} the geometry of the system, including both the double wall and the rooms acoustically coupled to the wall. The frequency range studied is in the 1 / 3 -octave bands between 40 Hz and 200 Hz. A parametric study is performed to investigate the influence on the sound transmission loss of various material and geometric properties of the wall and the dimensions of the connecting rooms. The model confirms the importance of primary <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> and the size of the connecting rooms in determining the degree of sound transmission loss. The primary <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> is mainly determined by the distance between the wall studs and the properties of the sheeting material. Wall length is also important; if the length is such that the wall studs of the last wall cavity are closer together than those of the other wall cavities, the primary <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> will be at a higher frequency, thereby decreasing sound transmission loss over a broader frequency range. Similar dimensions of the connecting rooms results in poor transmission loss, mainly at frequencies below 100 Hz (for the wall and room dimensions studied here) ...|$|E

Flight tests performed in the speed range from landing to a Mach number of 1. 86 and the altitude range from 697 meters (2300 feet) to 27, 550 meters (90, 300 feet) were supplemented by ground tests to identify and correct <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> and limit-cycle problems.

40|$|Abstract Passive {{flexibility}} {{was found}} to enhance propul-sive efficiency in swimming animals. In this study, we nu-merically investigate the roles of <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> and hydrodynamic wake resonance in optimizing efficiency of a flexible plunging foil. The results indicates that (1) opti-mal efficiency is not necessarily achieved when the driving frequency matches the structural eigenfrequency; (2) optimal efficiency always occurs when the driving frequency matches the wake resonant frequency of the time averaged velocity profile. Thus, the underlying principle of efficient propul-sion in flexible plunging foil is the hydrodynamic wake res-onance, rather than the <b>structural</b> <b>resonance.</b> In addition, {{we also found that}} whether the efficiency can be optimized at the structural resonant point depends on the strength of the leading edge vortex relative to that of the trailing edge vor-tex. The result of this work provides new insights into the role of passive flexibility in flapping-based propulsion...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} work evaluates {{the quality of}} the sensor to perform measurements and documents its effects on the performance of the system. It also evaluates if this performance changes due to the environments and other system parameters. These environments and parameters include vibration, system friction, <b>structural</b> <b>resonance,</b> and dynamic system input. The analysis is done by modeling a gimbal camera system that requires angular measurements from inertial sensors and gyros for stabilization. Overall, modeling includes models for four different types of gyros, the gimbal camera system, the drive motor, the motor rate control system, and the angle position control system. Models for friction, <b>structural</b> <b>resonance,</b> and vibration are analyzed, respectively. The system is simulated, for an ideal system, and then includes the more realistic environmental and system parameters. These simulations are run with each of the four types of gyros.

40|$|Flow-induced {{vibration}} of {{an elastic}} airfoil {{due to the}} wake propagating from an upstream cylinder at a Reynolds number of 10 000 based on cylinder diameter D was investigated. A laser vibrometer was employed to measure the bending and torsional vibration displacements at the mid-span of the airfoil and the cylinder. The dimensionless gap size S/D between the two structures {{was selected as the}} governing parameter of the flow-induced vibration problem. It is found that the vibration amplitudes of the elastic airfoil and the vortex shedding frequency of the coupled cylinder-airfoil system are strongly dependent on S/D, due to the different fluid-structure interaction experienced by the airfoil at various S/D. Strong vortex-induced vibration of the airfoil appears to be excited by the organized Karman-vortex-street (KVS) vortices in the cylinder wake for S/D> 3 and becomes stabilized for S/D≤ 3. However, {{as a result of the}} shear-layer-induced vibration at an appropriate frequency, <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> is also found to occur even though the airfoil is located in the stabilizing range. The occurrence of <b>structural</b> <b>resonance</b> is further supported by a complementary experiment where the slender structure is an elastic flat plate. This phenomenon indicates that assuming the structures in any fluid-structure interaction problem to be rigid is not appropriate, even though they might appear to be highly stiff.
