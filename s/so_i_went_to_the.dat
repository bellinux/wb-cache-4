2500|$|The {{journalist}} William Fotheringham remembered: [...] "He {{never lost}} his cantankerousness or gained any respect for authority. While walking up Scafell Pike one day, {{he and his}} group were told by a warden to turn back due to thick mist; the group returned, and later met Stallard at the bus, only to be told, 'I came to climb the bloody mountain, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Duvall {{married his}} fourth wife, Luciana Pedraza, granddaughter of Argentine aviator pioneer Susana Ferrari Billinghurst. He met Pedraza in Argentina, recalling, [...] "The flower shop was closed, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bakery. If the flower shop had been open, I never would've met her." [...] They were both born on January 5, but Duvall is 41 years older. They have been {{together}} since 1997. He produced, directed, and acted with her in Assassination Tango, {{with the majority of}} filming in Buenos Aires. Duvall is also known as a very skilled Argentine Tango dancer, having a Tango Studio in Argentina and in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for Power 106, Gomez spoke in-depth about the inspiration behind [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", saying: [...] "Everybody has had a say in my life [...] meaning the world, the perception, the media. It was really frustrating. There is a song on my record called ‘Kill Em with Kindness.’ So I’ve always done that. I ignore, I ignore, I ignore. And then {{it just kind of}} got out of hand. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new label [...] and I was like, I have to say something. I need to say what I want to say, and you guys have to help me {{figure out how to do}} that." [...] While working on the album, Gomez enlisted frequent collaborators Rock Mafia to help make her sound a reality. They helped Gomez on the creation of six tracks on the album, including [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", the latter being one of the most personal tracks on Revival. She told the producers that although the production was important, she wanted the focus of the song to be the lyrics.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{where the}} lord Athalbrand Fork-beard was dismounting, and greeted him, lifting my cap.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> pack my bag. And {{within an}} hour I {{was on my way}} to France.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} prevail on myself to speak <b>to</b> her. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> her room with my note, and {{knocked at the}} door.|$|R
60|$|I had {{not been}} there five minutes when the bell rang. Smith was in bed, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door myself and found Mr Fisher on the mat.|$|E
60|$|And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tomb, but Antony {{fled to the}} palace. When I came to {{the tomb}} I knocked upon the door, and Charmion looked forth from the window.|$|E
6000|$|He acquiesced: <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{room where}} Mr. Corbeck was, {{and brought him}} back with me. I thought the detectives were pleased at his going. On the way to my room he said: ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> my story, which, {{if any one}} dislikes, he has but to {{turn the}} leaf till he finds {{pasturage}} which suits him better.|$|R
6000|$|I {{filled my}} wallet with white stones, [...] I took three foxgloves in my hand, I slung my shoes across my back, [...] And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> fairyland.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed. The {{hotel was}} {{on the edge of}} a steep declivity. I {{wondered}} why the whole hills did not slide down, in some great natural catastrophe.|$|R
60|$|But, after all, {{there were}} few traits {{that could be made}} a note of. I soon grew weary of the scene, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> railway station, and waited there nearly an hour for the train to take me to Southport. Ormskirk is famous for its gingerbread, which women sell to the railway {{passengers}} at a sixpence for a rouleau of a dozen little cakes.|$|E
60|$|About half-an-hour after, {{the prince}} {{told me that}} I offered to wait a little before, that if I would now take the trouble he would give me leave {{to give him some}} wine; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table, filled a glass of wine, and brought it to him on a fine salver, which the glasses stood on, and brought the bottle or {{decanter}} for water in my other hand, to mix as he thought fit.|$|E
60|$|I {{asked the}} Nurse {{if she wanted}} anything. I noticed {{that she had a}} vinaigrette in her lap. Doubtless she, too, had felt some of the {{influence}} which had so affected me. She said that she had all she required, but that if she should want anything she would at once let me know. I wished to keep her from noticing my respirator, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chair in the shadow where her back was toward me. Here I quietly put it on, and made myself comfortable.|$|E
6000|$|... "And there's two {{religions}} {{going on}} in the nation now--High Church and High Chapel. And, thinks I, I'll play fair; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> High Church in the morning, and High Chapel in the afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed in her arms, {{and cried}} myself to sleep, {{thinking}} with my latest breath, in a tremor of horror, that I'd found it at last. Courtenay Ivor {{was the name}} of my father's murderer! ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{throwing}} her bonnet into a chair, and cutting some cake, she proceeded: 'Such hours as they keep! No one but Jane was up when <b>I</b> came, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> her room, {{and told her}} I would hear the rights of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{may not be}} able {{to bother}} later," [...] Dick smiled. [...] "When I got the doctor's warning I was very hard up, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{insurance}} people and asked how much they'd let me have if I surrendered the policy. Well, though they asked a lot of questions, we didn't come to terms. It seemed the other fellows were entitled to benefit; but something wasn't straight and I think the office will dispute their claim. I felt amused about it now and then; but they mustn't lose what they really lent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, when I came {{to examine}} the box I found {{there was no money}} in it, and nothing but papers that I would not dare to sell. I had lost my hold on Black Peter and was {{stranded}} in London without a shilling. There was only my trade left. I saw these advertisements about harpooners, and high wages, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shipping agents, and they sent me here. That's all I know, and I say again that if I killed Black Peter, the law should give me thanks, for I saved them the price of a hempen rope." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hurried {{away to the}} cabaret where Jacques and Roger were drinking. We {{talked the}} matter over, and agreed that the first thing {{was to get the}} four horses out of the town. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inn where you had put up, said I was your servant, paid the reckoning, and took away the horse. Then I got my own and joined the other two, who were mounted and ready. They each took a horse and rode off, {{settling}} to leave them at some farmhouse a short distance away, explaining there that the town was so full they could find no room for them.|$|E
60|$|I thought awhile whether I {{should ask}} her more, but it’s {{a bad idea}} to set natives up with any notion of {{consulting}} them, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Case. It was dark, and he was sitting alone, as he did mostly, smoking on the stairs.|$|R
5000|$|I wanted Glenn <b>to</b> know, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{his bedside}} and told him. I thought I saw a gleam in his eye, {{but the next}} day when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> visit him he didn't {{remember}} seeing me. As a scientist, he had died when he had that stroke. Albert Ghiorso ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought a}} while whether I should ask her more, but it's {{a bad idea}} to set natives up with any notion of {{consulting}} them, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Case. It was dark, and he was sitting alone, as he did mostly, smoking on the stairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "The plan I had in {{mind was}} to go and carry books and papers {{to the people in}} hospitals, as one of Mamma's friends has done for years. I went once to the City Hospital with her, and it was very interesting, but I didn't dare to go to the grown people all alone, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Children's Hospital, and soon loved to help amuse the poor little dears. I saved all the picture-books and papers I could find for them, dressed dolls, and mended toys, and got new ones, and made bibs and night-gowns, and felt like the mother of a large family.|$|E
6000|$|And then {{he sighed}} {{in such a}} sorrowful way that I was {{resolved}} he {{should have at least}} one layer of his real estate removed, if it sized up my whole influence and bankrupted the pile. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abbot and asked for a permit for this Brother. He blenched at the idea--I don't mean that you could see him blench, for of course you couldn't see it without you scraped him, and I didn't care enough about it to scrape him, but I knew the blench was there, just the same, and within a book-cover's thickness of the surface, too--blenched, and trembled. He said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Mary applied {{herself to}} the mouth of the kettle, and between indraws of steam said: [...] "The spasm came on just now, while I was asleep. I was nearly choking to death. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window I've done it often before, without, waking any one. Bessie's such an old maid about draughts. I tell you I was choking to death. I couldn't manage the catch, and I nearly fell out. That window opens too low. I cut my hand trying to save myself. Who has tied it up in this filthy handkerchief? I wish you had had my throat, Bessie. I never was nearer dying!" [...] She scowled on us all impartially, while her sister sobbed.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed, in the silent, wooden house. I {{had a small}} bedroom, {{clean and}} wooden and very cold. Outside, the stream was rushing. I covered myself with a great depth of featherbed, {{and looked at the}} stars, and the shadowy upper world, and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> sleep.|$|R
6000|$|After all it isn't a story; but I {{wanted to}} know {{which one of the}} heroes won the battle against the city. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a very learned friend and laid the case before him. What he said was: [...] "Please don't bother me; I have Christmas {{presents}} to buy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true, sir," [...] replied George, {{touching}} his cap, for George was an innately respectful man--respectful to all, though {{with a strong}} tendency to humorous impudence; [...] "very true, sir; that's just what I thought when I see you a-meditatin', <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> work at once without wastin' any time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not I. Women are bores, as Solomon {{found out}} long ago. Did I never tell you? I began, as he did, {{with the most}} select harem in Alexandria. But they quarrelled so, that one day I went out, and sold them all but one, who was a Jewess--so there were {{objections}} {{on the part of}} the Rabbis. Then I tried one, as Solomon did; but my [...] "garden shut up," [...] and my [...] "sealed fountain" [...] wanted me to be always in love with her, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lawyers, allowed her a comfortable maintenance, and now I am as free as a monk, and shall be happy to give your excellency the benefit of any good taste or experience which I may possess.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The horrid old thing!" [...] she exclaimed; [...] "I {{am always}} {{tripping}} over it," [...] {{and as she}} glanced at Dora the two girls broke into a laugh. [...] "I expect you think I look like a perfect guy," [...] she said, as they seated themselves, [...] "and so I do, but you see the calf is {{not much more than}} a week old, and its mother has entirely deserted it, and kicks and horns at it if it comes near her. It got to be so weak it could scarcely stand up, and I have adopted it, and feed it out of this bottle. The first time I did it I nearly ruined the dress I had on, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> garret and got this old gown, which covers me up very well, though it looks dreadfully, and is awfully awkward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a room {{back here}} that you can only get into by a ladder {{put up on the}} outside. I knew all about it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{ice-house}} and got a ladder and climbed into the room. I put my valise under my head, and prepared to take a good sleep on the floor, but in three minutes I found the place was full of wasps. I couldn't stay there, you know, and I was just getting ready to go down the ladder again when I happened to look out of a window that opened on the roof, and saw you in here. I could see only the back of your head, but although it was pretty well lighted, I couldn't judge very well by that what sort of a person you were. But I saw you were smoking, and it struck me that a man who smokes is generally a pretty good fellow, and so I came over." ...|$|E
5000|$|She said {{said to me}} [...] "I was in the south, {{you earn}} very good money, there are fishing boats, many foreigners, you can charge in dollars, you earn double because you are paid best." ... they gave you 40%, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Ushuaia where they did not deduct so much.|$|R
60|$|This I {{dared not}} gainsay, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> my chamber {{with a heart}} full of grief and joy, for these hours that are all of gladness come rarely to lovers, and to me were scantly measured. Perchance it was for my soul's welfare, to win me from {{the ways of the}} world.|$|R
5000|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} he said: It's difficult because half {{my family is}} Muslim, {{and the other half}} is Christian. I've always felt Turkish, though. My nene grandmother, she can't speak English. Half of my family, their first language is Turkish, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Turkish school before I played football, although I can't remember any of it now.|$|R
