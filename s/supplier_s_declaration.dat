The matching with the smallest total cost would assign each object pi to the supplier sj with the minimum cij value. In many scenarios, however, runner-up assignments may be required too, like for example when a decision maker needs to make additional considerations, not captured by cij values. In this case, it is necessary to examine several short-listed assignments before choosing one. This motivates the αTop-K query, which computes the K best assignments, i. e., those achieving the K smallest total costs.

In wholesale electricity markets, we predict that the bid price of the most expensive production unit can change by 1 - 10 % due to price instability. The price instability is reduced when suppliers have more steps in their supply functions for a given production technology. In the limit, as the number of steps increases and the cost uncertainty decreases, the Bayesian equilibrium converges to a pure-strategy NE without price instability, the Supply Function Equilibrium (SFE) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an industry {{where one of}} the manufacturers and its <b>supplier</b> (<b>S)</b> have engaged in some specific investment in the past. We assume that this has three consequences: S has lower expected production costs than other suppliers, supplier-switching costs exist, and the manufacturer may limit its rivals’ access to S. In the case when only S knows its true production costs, we compare alternative mechanisms to induce S to reveal its private information, namely, paying informational rents, using threats of switching suppliers, and most importantly, permitting S to serve other firms. We prove that the presence of asymmetric information mitigates the manufacturer’s incentives to engage in vertical restraints. We derive several policy implications from this result. Adapting to more efficient suppliers, supplier switching costs, sharing suppliers, vertical restraints, asymmetric information...|$|R

40|$|We {{challenge}} {{the view that}} the presence of powerful buyers stiffles suppliers' incentives to innovate. Following Katz (1987), we model buyer power as buyers' ability to substitute away from a given supplier and isolate several effects that support the opposite view, namely that the presence of powerful buyers induces a supplier to invest more in cost reduction. In contrast to negotiations with smaller buyers, the outcome of negotiations with large buyers is fully determined by their more valuable alternative supply option. This increases the <b>supplier.</b> <b>s</b> incentives to reduce marginal costs, both as the supplier receives a larger fraction of the thereby generated incremental profits and as this makes buyers' alternative supply option less valuable. The latter effect is due to downstream competition between buyers and, as we show, is also stronger the larger and thus the more powerful buyers are. Buyer power; Merger; Investment incentives...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ever {{since the}} {{emergence}} of the relational database model, the prob-lem of incompleteness has been studied extensively. Declarative semantics for disjunctive databases widely adopt two methodologies representing opposite ends of the spectrum- Minker’s GCWA interprets disjunctions exclusively while Ross and Topor’s DDR interprets them inclusively. We argue that the use of either one as the semantics is limiting. For example, in a blood group relation, saying that the blood group of John is A or B, BG(John,A) ∨ BG(John,B) can be in-terpreted exclusively while the statement <b>supplier</b> <b>S</b> 1 supplies part P 1 or P 2 to project J 1, supplies(S 1, P 1, J 1) ∨ supplies(S 1, P 2, J 1) need not necessarily be exclusive. In this paper, we present a model that allows the nature of the dis-junctions to be represented explicitly and show its relation to other semantics for disjunctive databases. A notable feature of this extension {{is that it does not}} require variables in order to represent indefinite information. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Engineer-to-Order supply {{chains are}} known to consist complex {{networks}} with numerous suppliers in different roles that may have high impact on the operational excellence of an ETO company and their competitive advantages. Therefore, supplier delivery performance is widely recognized as a critical challenge among ETO companies. This thesis contributes in delivery performance management research by studying how an ETO company may manage their procurement processes {{in order to improve}} their suppliers delivery performance. The underlying problem of the thesis emerges from high uncertainty and variability inside the supply chain which is evident for ETO companies. Research design This thesis approaches supplier delivery performance by trying to identify the costs associated with supplier untimeliness due to the delivery variance, the causes of untimeliness and process variability and to eliminate the sources of variability and causes of untimeliness in <b>supplier</b> <b>s</b> order fulfillment process. The thesis is conducted by using a case company in a single case study. The case study consists of a data analysis on supplier delivery data, interviews and a supplier development project on delivery variance reduction that provide the required information for the improvement suggestions and discussion in the end of this thesis. Findings ETO companies should emphasize the importance of supplier development and control on supplier process times in order to improve suppliers delivery performance. This is particularly important with strategically important suppliers that are considered as partners instead of replaceable suppliers. Furthermore, increased and more effective communication between buyer, supplier and third parties is also found as a central improvement area when trying to reduce the delivery variance. Finally, since the delivery performance should be measured financially, this thesis suggests a new performance indicator that considers <b>supplier</b> <b>s</b> statistical delivery variability and provides an expected cost for untimeliness. Research limitations Most significant limitations were found in discussion on delivery variance reduction that is purely based on single supplier performance and the results may be somewhat exceptional and cannot be used directly with other suppliers. Also, the suggested KPI can be considered to be limited due to its complexity when calculating the estimated cost of supplier untimeliness.
