2500|$|In the Palearctic, {{the golden}} eagle co-exists {{with several other}} large {{raptorial}} birds called eagles. Unlike in their relationship with smaller raptors, golden eagles are rarely reported to hunt other eagle species. Most conflicts between different eagles are over kills or carrion, though some species will defend nesting territories from each other. When it comes to carrion and kills, usually the “aggressor” (that is the eagle who initiates the agonistic behavior) is victorious over the other eagle. Considering that they overlap considerably in both distribution and prey selection, there is remarkably almost no known accounts from Eurasia of golden eagles behaving aggressively with other Aquila eagles. This is possibly due to segregated habitat preferences amongst these species, with lesser and greater spotted eagles being essentially woodland or wooded wetland-dwelling birds, Spanish and eastern imperial eagles inhabiting fragmented, open woods and steppe eagles generally living in flat, often treeless steppe and desert-like habitats. In central Asia, where golden eagles and other Aquila species are rare or absent, steppe eagles sometimes nest in mountainous rock formations like golden eagles. Compared to these eagles, the Bonelli's eagle {{appears to have a}} more contentious relationship with golden eagles, as they are often attracted to similar prey (largely rabbits and gamebirds) and occur in abutting habitats. The larger golden eagle is apparently dominant and, in at least one case, has killed and consumed a Bonelli's. The two species defend their territories from one another exclusively, in the same way they defend them from others of their own species. Both will use nests built by the other species, more so the golden using Bonelli's nests than vice versa. Further east, in Israel, Bonelli's and golden eagles are competitors as well. In the dry, barren Negev Desert, golden eagles nests were found [...] apart and Bonelli's were scarce. In the Judaean Desert, which has more annual rainfall and more available prey, the distance between golden eagle nests averaged [...] and the Bonelli's eagle easily outnumbered them. Apparently, the Bonelli's eagle exceptionally outcompeted its larger cousin here due to a subtle topographic variation in the habitat. Still, in areas without unnatural human pressures, the gradation between these species is still adequate enough that they can exist without serious negative effect on either population. In Japan, golden eagles were observed to hunt mountain hawk-eagles (Nisaetus nipalensis), {{despite the fact that the}} local race of hawk eagle is around the same mass as a Japanese golden eagle. The Bale Mountains of Ethiopia is arguably the richest biosphere the golden eagle is known to inhabit and there, this species may potentially interact with more than 10 other eagle species and nearly 30 other accipitrid species, including both migratory and resident breeding species. These are often supported by an exceptionally diverse, dense population of rodents there. The Bale Mountains golden eagles were recorded kleptoparatisizing <b>steppe</b> eagles, augur <b>buzzard</b> (Buteo augur), pallid harrier (Circus macrourus) and lanner falcons (Falco biarmicus) and the eagles were themselves kleptoparatisized by steppe eagles on three occasions. The golden eagles were also observed to chase tawny and steppe eagles out of their nesting territories. In the Bale Mountains, the golden eagle overlaps with perhaps its closest living relative, the Verreaux's eagle. The golden eagles appear to vigorously defend their territories from the Verreaux's eagles and, as in its relationship with the Bonelli's, the two species appear to maintain exclusive territories. Several chases involving the golden chasing Verreaux's were witnessed but only one where a Verreaux's chased off the golden. Despite several reported antagonistic interactions, no other raptors were found as prey in the Bale Mountains nests of golden eagles.|$|R

50|$|A small buzzard {{and quite}} similar to the <b>steppe</b> <b>buzzard</b> Buteo buteo vulpinus, the migratory {{subspecies}} of the Palearctic common buzzard which winters over most of Africa. The adult has brown upperparts with paler underparts with heavy brown blotches on the breast, belly, flanks and underwing coverts. The underside of the flight feathers is barred with a distinct black band along the rear edge of the wing. The tail is brown above, light grey below and shows faint narrow bars which are broadest just before the tail tip. Juveniles are buffier below and less heavily marked than the adults.|$|E
50|$|The forest buzzard forms {{part of a}} {{superspecies}} {{which includes}} the common buzzard and the Madagascar buzzard, {{as well as the}} mountain buzzard. The decision to treat forest buzzard and mountain buzzard as different species is based on differences in habitat, structure and plumages {{and the fact that the}} two taxa are not monophyletic. It is likely that the forest buzzard evolved from the <b>steppe</b> <b>buzzard,</b> which is a common wintering bird within the breeding range of the forest buzzard. The steppe buzzards is a generalist and breeds over a large area of the eastern Palearctic in a variety of habitats and winters widely in eastern and southern Africa, with a few non-breeding birds remaining in southern Africa over the northern summer.|$|E
5000|$|This {{is one of}} {{the largest}} species of Buteo. Length can range from 50 to 66 cm and {{wingspan}} from 115 to 160 cm. Females, at an average mass of 1.3 kg, are larger than males, at an average of 1.1 kg. There are many different colour forms, but usually long-leggeds have a clear orange tint to the plumage, red or orange tail, pale head and largely white underwings. There is usually a distinctive black carpal patch and dark trailing edge to the wing. The rump and [...] "trousers" [...] are often dark or deep rufous. Plumage varies from ghostly pale individuals to very dark ones. Some plumages are almost similar to those of the <b>steppe</b> <b>buzzard,</b> the eastern subspecies of the common buzzard (Buteo buteo vulpinus), but long-legged buzzards have longer wings and are more like rough-legged buzzards or even a small Aquila eagle.|$|E
5000|$|The forest buzzard is {{very similar}} to the {{abundant}} summer migrant <b>steppe</b> <b>buzzard</b> Buteo buteo vulpinus, the head, the back and upperwings are brown, marked out with rufous edges to the feathers the amount of which varies between individuals. The chin is whitish and unmarked, the breast and belly are whitish but marked with a variable amount of brown spots, and the undertail coverts are plain whitish. There is variation and some adults show brown barring along the breast sides and the belly while all but the palest birds show a distinctive white ‘U’ mark {{in the middle of the}} otherwise blotched abdomen. The underwings are white, with a reddish-brown tinge on the lesser underwing coverts and a dark comma shaped mark at the tip of primary coverts [...] The plumage on the thighs are uniformly reddish-brown, and the axillary feathers are white with brown barring. The upper tail is brown, washed with reddish-brown and the tail has some narrow dark brown bands with a broad dark brown subterminal band while the undertail bands can be indistinct. The body length is 41-48 cm and the wingspan is 102-117 cm.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} lizard buzzards is {{extremely}} large {{and does not}} approach the threshold for vulnerable under range distribution.The population trend appears to be stable and does not approach thresholds for vulnerable.The population size is extremely large and for these reasons is evaluated as least concern.However, in Africa particularly West and Southern Africa there have been recorded dramatic declines in some raptors. The reasons for raptor decline in Africa are rapid human population growth driving overexploitation of the land causing biodiveristy loss and a decreased species richness. The raptor population declines in West Africa {{have been linked to}} loss of woodland and nest sites,increased pesticide use,intensive cultivation especially cotton and disturbance of nests. In Southern Africa raptor decline has been linked to use of poisons,powerline electrocutions, habitat destruction and raptor drowning in farm reservoirs. Despite high human population and activity in Africa, not all raptor species have declined sharply.Some raptors, especially opportunistic generalists and migrants have increased. In West Africa the grasshopper buzzard, black kite and hooded vulture have increased in number and range. Similarly in the Western Cape of South Africa, the <b>steppe</b> <b>buzzard,</b> lesser kestrel and yellow-billed kite have increased range and number. Currently there is insufficient data on the Lizard Buzzard to determine its adaptation to human land usage.It is unclear how it has adapted to loss of Woodland its preferred habitat and nesting site.Its preferred prey insects, lizards and rodents remain common in most human altered landscapes which could account for its current survival.|$|E
30|$|Avifauna on the {{mountain}} was sparse, with only twelve species recorded during the survey. Apart from raptors and two southern African endemics, these were mostly inconspicuous birds. Three of the raptors – Buteo vulpinus (<b>Steppe</b> <b>Buzzard),</b> Falco amurensis (Amur Falcon) and Milvus migrans (Yellow-billed Kite) – are non-breeding migrants and not confined to mountain regions (Hockey et al. 2005). No evidence (visual or audio) of Chaetops aurantius (Drakensberg Rockjumper) was noted, although the habitat is favourable. As the bird was recorded visually on the higher Koudeveldberge massif (20 km to north) in December 2011 by VRC, {{there is a chance}} that it may occur sporadically on these lower Kamdebooberg mountains. The greatest number of bird species were noted from the surrounding Karoo plains (not included in the Additional file 2 : Appendix 2), most spectacularly an influx of Neotis ludwigii (Lüdwig’s Bustard) feeding on the emergent insects during and after the heavy rains.|$|E
40|$|Counts of {{migrating}} raptors at Batumi, Georgia, {{revealed the}} eastern Black Sea coast to form {{one of the}} most important bottlenecks for raptor migration during autumn in the Eurasian-African migration system. Totals for 10 species (European Honey-buzzard Pernis apivorus, <b>Steppe</b> <b>Buzzard</b> Buteo buteo vulpinus, Black Kite Milvus migrans, Eurasian Sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus, Levant Sparrowhawk Accipiter brevipes, Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus, Pallid Harrier Circus macrourus, Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina, Greater Spotted Eagle Aquila clanga, Booted Eagle Aquila pennata) exceeded 1 % of their estimated world population. We compare the observed abundance of each species to estimates of the presumed source populations in European Russia. Counts of most species involved only a limited subset of these source populations, except for European Honey-buzzard and Lesser Spotted Eagle, which were more numerous than predicted. This could be due to inaccurate population estimates or because birds from NE Europe or W Asia are also using this migration route...|$|E
40|$|South Africa is {{traditionally}} known to {{play host to}} two taxa of small Buteo, the endemic and uncommon Forest Buzzard B. trizonatus, and <b>Steppe</b> <b>Buzzard</b> B. b. vulpinus, an abundant Palearctic migrant. Since the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, a number of buzzards appearing unlike B. trizonatus have been found breeding in the south-west Cape, particularly on the Cape Peninsula and {{in and around the}} Elgin Valley, ca. 60 km east of Cape Town. Some of these buzzards resemble B. b. vulpinus, whilst others appear atypical of both B. trizonatus and B. b. vulpinus. This study conducted genetic and morphological analyses on a number of buzzards sampled in the south-west Cape, and compared them with three candidate taxa considered most likely to, in full or in part, explain the identity of these â€˜mysteryâ€™ buzzards. The candidate taxa were: <b>Steppe</b> <b>Buzzard</b> B. b. vulpinus, MÃ©nÃ©triesâ€™s Buzzard B. b. menetriesi and Forest Buzzard B. trizonatus. Morphology data and genetic samples were collected from 23 buzzards through capture with a Bal-Chatri trap, from chicks in nests, from captive birds brought to rehabilitation centres or from birds found dead. The comparative morphology of the buzzards sampled in the Cape was determined by constructing a Discriminant Component Analysis using 9 morphometric characters which had previously been established as being important in the separation of Old World Buteo taxa (Kruckenhauser et al., 2004). Blood samples were then analysed using 18 polymorphic microsatellite loci designed for Buteo swainsoni (Hull et al., 2007), using the program STRUCTURE 2. 3 to analyse the population assignment of the sampled buzzards. The majority of buzzards were found to most closely match B. trizonatus or B. b. vulpinus in their morphology (52 %), and their genetic signature (65 %). Additionally, two unidentified genetic signatures were evident. One of these signatures remains unresolved, because buzzards with this genetic signature lacked morphological data. The second signature, however, was displayed by buzzards with larger morphology than is known from both B. b. vulpinus and B. trizonatus. Based on previous research these larger buzzards lay most closely within the morphospace of B. b. menetriesi, being far removed from the morphospace of both B. b. vulpinus and B. trizonatus. Thus, it is conceivable that some of the birds belong to this taxon...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the autumn migratory {{behavior of the}} common buzzard Buteo buteo from recoveries of 2157 ringed individuals across Europe over the last 50 yr, {{as well as from}} birds migrating through Sweden and Spain between 1976 and 2008. A generalized linear model analysis showed evidence of a shortening of the distance between areas of common buzzard breeding and wintering over the last 50 yr. The ability of common buzzard populations to shorten their migration distance was related to temperature anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere and depended on the breeding region, with northern European populations shortening their migration distance to the greatest extent. Changes in migratory distances were accompanied by no apparent shift in migratory direction. A significant reduction in the annual number of common buzzards migrating through the Strait of Gibraltar (Spain) occurred between 1976 - 1977 and 1999 - 2008. Similar decreases in the number of migrating common buzzards were observed in the annual passage at Falsterbo (Sweden) between 1975 and 2007. Furthermore, a quantile regression analysis of the time series record of migrating common buzzards at the strait revealed that median- and late-passage common buzzards crossed up to 7 d earlier in 2008 than in 1999. Shifts in migratory behavior in the European common buzzard may have ecological and evolutionary consequences for the different species of the genus Buteo in Europe, since the winter distribution of the <b>steppe</b> <b>buzzard</b> Buteo buteo vulpinus in central and eastern Europe appears to be affected by the distribution of common buzzards (B. b. buteo) from western Europe, which are extending their breeding range northwards. © Inter-Research 2014.

40|$|Just after {{crossing}} the Tropic of Capricorn, heading north through Limpopo Province, South Africa, one begins {{to see the}} rugged outline of the Soutpansberg Mountains on the horizon (see Figure 1). The mountains bring four things to my mind. One is their geology. Though they are as much as 1. 8 million years old, they are still changing, still forming, still taking shape: rains erode them; roads and houses and farms cut into them. A second issue is bird life, specifically that birds breeding in Europe, such as the Yellow Wagtail and the <b>Steppe</b> <b>Buzzard,</b> {{spend much of their}} lives in the Soutpansbergs. The Soutpansbergs are far from Europe, but yet these birds establish stretched out connections between the two places. A third issue is also about connections: all along the Soutpansbergs there are antennae, transmitters, aerials. It’s difficult to say which belonged to the South Africa military, to mobile phone companies or Internet Service Providers; but what was important to me was that they helped me keep in touch with people in the vicinity via mobile phone and with people abroad via the Internet. They were part of a ‘coded infrastructure’ (Dodge & Kitchin, 2005) that facilitated much of what I had to do in the region (on how these technologies forge ‘coded spatialities’ of fieldwork, see Fraser, 2007 a). A final issue is the people who live along the mountain range, some of whose actions I wanted to try to grasp. Most are indigenous VhaVenda or Tsonga people. Their access to land has been curtailed for the last 100 years after the arrival of white settlers, mostly Afrikaners, who throughout most of the twentieth century have benefited from a raft of racially discriminatory land (and other) policies. It was this inequality in land rights that led me to the Soutpansbergs in August 2004 to conduct my doctoral dissertation research on the politics and geography of South Africa’s land reform programme (e. g. see Fraser, 2007 b) ...|$|E
