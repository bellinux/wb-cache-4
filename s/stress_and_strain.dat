40|$|A semi-analytic {{solution}} for residual autofrettage <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> in open-end cylinders is given. The primary {{objective of this}} research is to reveal the effect of white layer {{in the vicinity of the}} inner radius of the cylinder on the magnitude of residual <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> at this radius. In contrast to many available semi-analytic solutions for residual autofrettage <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>strains,</b> the von Mises yield criterion and its associated flow rule are adopted. A remarkable property of the solution found is that the residual <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> in the white layer can be determined without solving the strain equations in the plastic region. Therefore, the solution is rather simple. In particular, numerical techniques are only necessary to solve transcendental and ordinary differential equations...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of notch-root <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> in bodies subjected to multiaxial loading, a quantitative relationship between Neuber rule <b>and</b> the equivalent <b>strain</b> energy density method is found. In the case of elastic range, both Neuber rule <b>and</b> the equivalent <b>strain</b> energy density method get the same estimation of the local <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>strains.</b> Whereas {{in the case of}} elastic-plastic range, Neuber rule generally overestimates the notch-root <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> <b>and</b> the equivalent <b>strain</b> energy density method tends to underestimate the notch-root <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>strains.</b> A modified method is presented considering the material constants of elastic-plastic Poisson's ratio, elastic modulus, shear elastic modulus, <b>and</b> yield <b>stress.</b> The essence of the modified model is to add a modified coefficient to Neuber rule, which makes the calculated results tend to be more precise and reveals its energy meaning. This approach considers the elastic-plastic properties of the material itself and avoids the blindness of selecting coefficient values. Finally the calculation results using the modified model are validated with the experimental data...|$|R

25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} potential can {{be created}} in any bulk or nanostructured semiconductor crystal having non central symmetry, such as the Group III–V and II–VI materials, due to polarization of ions under applied <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain.</b> This property is common to both the zincblende and wurtzite crystal structures. To first order, {{there is only one}} independent piezoelectric coefficient in zincblende, called e14, coupled to shear components of the strain. In wurtzite, there are instead three independent piezoelectric coefficients: e31, e33 and e15.|$|E

The converse {{was seen in the}} fascicle ends adjacent to the superficial aponeurosis, which decreased in fiber strain from proximal to distal portions of the MG muscle. These trends may have been due to changes in CSA of the muscle at the proximal and distal ends of the MG, resulting in regions of high <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> concentration.|$|E

25|$|As the {{industry}} strives to reduce {{maintenance and repair}} costs, non-destructive testing of structures becomes increasingly valued both in production control and {{as a means to}} measure the utilization and condition of key infrastructure. There are several measurement techniques to measure stress in a material. However, techniques using optical measurements, magnetic measurements, X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction are all limited to measuring surface or near surface stress or strains. Acoustic waves propagate with ease through materials and provide thus a means to probe the interior of structures, where the <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> level is important for the overall structural integrity.|$|E

25|$|B-72 is a {{thermoplastic}} resin {{that was created}} by Rohm and Haas {{for use as a}} surface coating and as a vehicle for Flexographic ink. However B-72 is now being used more as an adhesive specifically for ceramic and glass.

This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically-used adhesives and tolerates <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> on a join that most others can not. One major drawback to using B-72 is the difficulty of applying the acrylic resin as an adhesive, as is difficulty in manipulating the substance as a workable agent.

40|$|During {{agitated}} drying {{and mixing}} processes, particle beds {{are exposed to}} shear deformation. This leads to particle attrition, the extent of which {{is dependent on the}} prevailing <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> in the bed. The distributions of shear <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rates within the bed are highly non-uniform, requiring attention to localised conditions. Therefore a narrow angular sector of the bed is divided radially and vertically into a number of measurement cells, within which the <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rates are calculated throughout one rotation by the Distinct Element Method. These are then used in an empirical relationship of material breakage to predict the extent of attrition due to agitation. Here we investigate the influence of the measurement cell size on the estimated <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rates, <b>and</b> the subsequent effect on the predicted attrition. The measurement cell size is altered by varying the measurement sector size and the number of radial and vertical divisions within it. The median particle size is also varied to establish its influence on the predicted attrition. An increase in the average number of particles in a given cell, by varying the particle size or measurement cell dimensions, leads to a reduction in the estimated <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rates, <b>and</b> therefore a reduction in the predicted attrition. Comparison of the predicted attrition with the experimental breakage in the agitated vessel shows that the prediction method is accurate when the cell dimensions are comparable to the width of a naturally occurring shear band...|$|R
