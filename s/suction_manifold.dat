If the fluid’s hydrostatic pressure {{is less than}} formation pressure the well can flow.The most common reason for insufficient fluid density is drilling into unexpected abnormally pressured formations.

Such as drilling across a fault that abruptly changes the formation being drilled.Mishandling mud at the surface accounts for many instances of insufficient fluid weight. Such as opening wrong valve on the pump <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> and allowing a tank of light weight fluid to be pumped; bumping the water valve so more is added than intended; washing off shale shakers; or clean-up operations.

40|$|Geometric and {{thermodynamic}} {{simulations of}} a twin screw compressor {{were carried out}} to determine the flows through the suction and discharge ports, and to calculate the compressor performance. As flows through ports are oscillatory in nature, gas pulsations are excited in the <b>suction</b> and discharge <b>manifolds.</b> The thermodynamic activity and the gas pulsation {{interact with each other}} during the process. Gas pulsations not only alter the gas conditions inside the compression chamber and thus change the performance of the compressor, but also cause the compressor structure to vibrate and radiate noise. ^ The acoustic characteristics of the <b>suction</b> and discharge <b>manifolds</b> were described in terms of pressure and volume flow transfer functions. The fundamental physics of gas oscillation was studied by use of a lumped parameter model and a one-dimensional continuous model. However a finite element model was employed in this research to deal with the complicated geometry and large size of the three-dimensional enclosure of a real screw compressor. ^ Results of the mathematical modeling and computer simulation, were checked against the measured data and showed good agreement. Influences of gas pulsation on the compressor performance and the vibration and noise generation were studied. These studies included the calculation of the natural frequencies of the compressor shell and measurements of the acceleration and noise spectra. Acoustic properties of the steel wool demister in the discharge manifold were also measured and their influence was studied. Effects of the over/under pressure condition and the volume ratio unloading mechanism on the compressor performance and gas pulsation were investigated. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to perform sensitivity analysis of a compressor simulation model using a global sensitivity analysis method. In this paper, Sobol’s method of global sensitivity analysis, which is based on decomposition of variance, is applied to a compressor simulation model. A previously developed and tested compressor simulation model is used to perform sensitivity analysis of gas pulsations in the <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> of a multicylinder reciprocating compressor. The focus of the research is to determine the sensitivity of gas pulsations in the <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> of the compressor to three design parameters, namely, radius, width and depth of the <b>suction</b> <b>manifold.</b> Sobol’s method of global sensitivity analysis was used to calculate the first order effect and total effect of the <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> radius, width and depth on the manifold pressure response. It was also showed that <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure response was most sensitive to changes in manifold radius, followed by manifold width and depth.

40|$|Gas {{pulsations}} are {{the most}} common problem in reciprocating compressors, resulting in unwanted and annoying noise and adding energy requirements to the compressor. Extensive research has been conducted on developing models of reciprocating compressors to enable design optimization studies, reduce compressor noise, and improve energy efficiency. Uncertainties and sensitivities are inherent in any compressor model and very few studies have focused on how these uncertainties and sensitivities affect the validity of the model when the model is perturbed with respect to a baseline set of parameters. This work focuses on reviewing the approaches taken so far to understand the effects of compressor model uncertainties and to quantify the effects of modeling uncertainties and input variations on a compressor model using uncertainty and sensitivity analysis tools. The objective is to develop better simulation models resulting in lower gas pulsations in the <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> and to lower energy requirements to the compressor. ^ The compressor model developed by Park (Park, 2004) was used as the baseline compressor model for demonstrating the application of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis tools for use in the compressor models. Local sensitivity analysis methods, using the derivative as a measure of parameter sensitivity, were implemented to quantify the uncertainty in the output, and global sensitivity analysis methods, based on the decomposition of variance, were implemented to determine the output sensitivity. Sobol 2 ̆ 7 s method of global sensitivity analysis was used to calculate the first order effects and total effects of the <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> radius, width and depth on the manifold pressure response. ^ A new sensitivity analysis method based on the concept of total pulsation energy in the <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> was developed to perform a sensitivity analysis of the compressor <b>suction</b> <b>manifold.</b> This method has the advantage that it not only determined the input parameters that produced the lowest gas pulsations, but it also the minimized the energy requirement to the system. A new systematic approach was developed using sensitivity analysis methods to aid the compressor <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> design using uncertainty bounds on the input and specifying the output in terms of a probability distribution. ^ The use of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis methods in this work helped in accomplishing the following: (a) it was determined that the compressor suction valve is the most critical component in the model to which the output response is most sensitive; and based on these findings, improvements were made in the valve model by transitioning from a 1 D model to a 2 D finite element valve model; (b) the global sensitivity analysis was used to indicate that the manifold pressure response is most sensitive to changes in manifold radius, followed by manifold width and depth; (c) interactions or higher order effects among the input parameters were also determined; (d) global sensitivity analysis methods were used to determine the set of parameters that produce the maximum and minimum gas pulsations in the <b>suction</b> <b>manifold,</b> which is a useful information when conducting design studies; (e) sensitivity analysis methods were used to identify critical frequencies in the pressure response which were later used in the design of suction manifold; (f) a new method of sensitivity analysis was developed and applied to the simulation model to determine the sensitivity of the input parameters; and (g) the new approach for the compressor manifold design was developed based on the sensitivity analysis procedure developed earlier to select the design parameter of the <b>suction</b> <b>manifold.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} {{for the design}} of the <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> of a {{reciprocating}} compressor using sensitivity and uncertainty methods was used. The objective was to pick the optimal values of the compressor <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> to minimize gas pulsations. The advantage of the method is that the input parameters do not have fixed values but a range is provided. Similarly, the output is specified in terms of a probability density function. Another advantage of this method is that we can set our limit on the maximum values of the gas pulsation that are permissible and then vary the input parameters so that all the gas pulsations are within the acceptable limits. This method also provides a way to compare gas pulsation level at different cylinder locations and how variations in an input parameter affect the gas pulsations at different locations...|$|E
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{model for a}} multi-cylinder automotive compressor has been developed. The equations for the compression cycle based on the {{first law of thermodynamics}} are derived to calculate the instantaneous pressure in the cylinder. During the suction process, the dynamic motion of an automotive valve between a stop and seat are approximated as one-dimensional in the transverse direction and a linear beam model is used to describe these motions. Also the mass flow rate equation through the valve port is derived assuming one-dimensional compressible flow in a squared-edge orifice. ^ After it is demonstrated that the {{simulation model}} predicts the thermodynamic processes and the valve dynamics well, it is used to analyze gas pulsations in the <b>suction</b> <b>manifold.</b> A complicated real <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> connected to an anechoic pipe is modeled as a simplified annular cavity with an area change. Then linear acoustic plane wave theory and a four pole parameter formulation are used to derive and solve the governing inhomogeneous equation for the forced pressure responses in the manifold. Along with the resultant mathematical models, a characteristic cylinder method is used {{in order to reduce the}} computational time. The method is proven to be reliable in predicting gas pulsations. ^ Because the assumption of the anechoic condition of the suction line is restricted to academic type experiments, the simulation procedure for predicting gas pulsations in the <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> connected to a finite inlet pipe is described. Then several parametric studies are performed including changes of the inlet and the discharge locations and the addition of an area change. The inclusions of the suction mufflers are also considered to examine the influence on gas pulsations. The four pole parameters for mufflers and the suction line with temperature variation are formulated and then used as fundamental tools to investigate the temperature effects on the gas pulsations. The valve opening time and clearance volume of the piston are also changed in order to understand the effects of variability from valve-to-valve as are the effects of changes in the characteristics and phases of the mass flow rate through the suction valves. ...|$|E

40|$|Case Studypg. 269 - 290 Background: After revamp of {{reformer}} CCR {{process where}} all three compressors are running without stand-by, compressor valve life decreased drastically from 1 {{year to a}} few(2 ~ 3) months. Troubleshooting: Whole entire factors were investigated from process condition change, piping layout, separating drum size and valve design. Very viscous and sticky heavy hydrocarbon called `Green Oil? was found at the valves & cylinder could cause valve late closing and consequential excessive impact stress during valve closing. Increased colder spill-back by-pass flow could cool down gas after separator drum made easy formation of heavy hydrocarbon condensate. Moreover liquid condensate could exist as slug at low point of <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> piping directly connected to compressor suction. Valve dynamics and pulsation after revamp was acceptable but plate type valve seemed to be not good choice under service including sticky liquid showing bouncing at edge of plate during late closing. Solution implementation and Result: Low point drain of compressor <b>suction</b> <b>manifold</b> piping was added for liquid removal and spill-back flow was reduced by running compressors at partial load to reduce condensation by colder by-pass flow. Valve type was changed to poppet type which is known as relatively better for very viscous and sticky liquid service. Detail study and investigation on suction separator showed nothing bad. After all improvement implementation valve life increased to over 1 year. Lesson Learned: This is a case study for valve failure where entire relevant factors were investigated and any failure of each parameter or its combination can reduce valve life.

Sobol’s method—a variance based global sensitivity analysis method is applied to a nonlinear function to highlight and outline the implementation details of the method.
