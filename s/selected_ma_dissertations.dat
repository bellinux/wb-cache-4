40|$|This {{paper has}} {{investigated}} {{the way the}} dissertation writing component of MA TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) programmes in Iran {{has changed over the}} past decade in relation to globalization. The data, collected from 40 questionnaires completed by Iranian academic staff teaching these programmes, suggest that while change in the content and curriculum has been minimal, some major shifts are observed in the functions <b>MA</b> <b>dissertations</b> serve. The most fundamental change reported is that dissertations are now seen in this local context as an opportunity to respond to the global trend of publish or perish. The analysis of the data demonstrates a complex picture of how global trends, national higher education policies and regulations and the local initiatives interact with one another to turn <b>MA</b> <b>dissertations</b> into a source of research publications...|$|R

The corpus is composed of 10 <b>MA</b> <b>dissertation</b> introductions with emphasis in the arguments for the research, which are reinforced by the constant occurrence of NECESSITY JUSTIFICATION and AIMS OF THE RESEARCH. We adopt the methodology called case study; therefore we analyze a specifi c discourse community and, for this, we used the software Wordsmith Tools (Scott, 1996), a device that allowed us to analyze in a detailed manner the lexical items from the texts. The analysis of our corpus showed that, at the Program in Applied Linguistics and Language Studies of PUC-SP, modalization is frequently used through modal verbs in the excerpts called NECESSITY JUSTIFICATION and AIMS OF THE RESEARCH...|$|R
