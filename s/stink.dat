5|$|If countershading paints out shadows, the reverse, darkening {{the belly}} and {{lightening}} the back, would maximise contrast by {{adding to the}} natural fall of light. This pattern of animal coloration is found in animals like the skunk and honey badger with strong defences—the offensive <b>stink</b> of the skunk, and the sharp claws, aggressive nature and <b>stink</b> of the honey badger. These animals do not run when under attack, but move slowly, often turning to face the danger, and giving deimatic or threat displays either to startle inexperienced predators, or as an aposematic signal, to warn off experienced ones.|$|E
5|$|In {{displays}} of aggression, males {{engage in a}} social display behaviour called <b>stink</b> fighting, which involves impregnating their tails with secretions from the antebrachial and brachial glands and waving the scented tail at male rivals.|$|E

5|$|The Great <b>Stink</b> was {{an event}} in central London in July and August 1858 during which the hot weather {{exacerbated}} the smell of untreated human waste and industrial effluent that was present {{on the banks of}} the River Thames. The problem had been mounting for some years, with an ageing and inadequate sewer system that emptied directly into the Thames. The miasma from the effluent was thought to transmit contagious diseases, and three outbreaks of cholera prior to the Great <b>Stink</b> were blamed on the ongoing problems with the river.|$|E
5|$|Bamford {{arrives at}} the pie shop, informing Mrs. Lovett that neighbors have been {{complaining}} of the <b>stink</b> from her chimney. Todd distracts him with an offer of a free grooming and murders him. Mrs. Lovett informs Todd of Toby's suspicions, and the pair search for the boy, who hid in the sewers after finding human remains in Mrs Lovett's bakehouse. Meanwhile, Anthony brings Johanna, disguised as a sailor, to the shop, and has her wait there while he leaves to find a coach.|$|E
5|$|In Hemiptera (true bugs), the {{forewings}} may be hardened, {{though to}} a lesser extent than in the beetles. For example, the anterior part of the front wings of <b>stink</b> bugs is hardened, while the posterior part is membranous. They are called hemelytron (pl. hemelytra). They are only found in the suborder Heteroptera; the wings of the Homoptera, such as the cicada, are typically entirely membranous. Both forewings and hindwings of Cicada are membranous, most species are glass-like although some are opaque. Cicadas are not good fliers and most fly only a few seconds. When flying, forewing and hindwing are hooked together by a grooved coupling along the hindwing costa and forewing margin. Most species have a basic venation as shown in the following picture.|$|E

5|$|Non-bluffing (aposematic) {{displays}} {{occur in}} mammals which possess powerful defences such as spines or <b>stink</b> glands, and which habitually warn off potential predators rather than attempting escape by running. The lowland streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus) raises the spines {{on its head}} and back when confronted by a predator, and moves its head up and down. Porcupines such as Erethizon erect their long sharp quills and adopt a hunched, head-down posture when a predator is nearby. The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on its front legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E
5|$|Stratigeas {{made her}} debut as a villainous {{character}} on the March 19, 2000 episode of Sunday Night Heat, under the ring name Trish Stratus. She appeared on stage to scout Test and Prince Albert. The next night on Raw, Stratus began her first {{role in the}} company, managing Test and Albert in the tag team T & A. It was during her stint managing T & A that Stratus took her first major bump in the ring, by being driven through a table by the Dudley Boyz at Backlash, after she had been taunting Bubba Ray Dudley for several weeks. In June, {{she was on the}} receiving end of a <b>stink</b> face from Rikishi on Raw.|$|E

Along with Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, sent by Wilson as a British representative, he watched the bombing of Nagasaki from the observation plane Big <b>Stink.</b> He also formed part of the Manhattan Project's post-war scientific mission to Hiroshima and Nagasaki that assessed the extent of the damage caused by the bombs.|$|E

5|$|Like all Phallus species, P.indusiatus is saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} from breaking down wood and plant organic matter. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups in disturbed ground and among wood chips. In Asia, it grows among bamboo forests, and typically fruits after heavy rains. The {{method of reproduction}} for stinkhorns, including P.indusiatus, is different from most agaric mushrooms, which forcibly eject their spores. Stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass that has a sharp, sickly-sweet odor of carrion. The cloying <b>stink</b> of mature fruit bodies—detectable from a considerable distance—is attractive to certain insects. Species recorded visiting the fungus include stingless bees of the genus Trigona, and flies of the families Drosophilidae and Muscidae. Insects assist in spore dispersal by consuming the gleba and depositing excrement containing intact spores to germinate elsewhere. Although {{the function of the}} indusium is not known definitively, it may visually entice insects not otherwise attracted by the odour, and serve as a ladder for crawling insects to reach the gleba.|$|E
5|$|Purnell, Parsons, Paul Tibbets, Spaatz and Curtis LeMay met on Guam on 7 August, the {{day after}} the Hiroshima attack, to discuss what should be done next. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have a Fat Man bomb ready by 11 August, as {{originally}} planned, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if it could be readied by 9 August. Parsons agreed to do so. For this mission, Ashworth was the weaponeer, with Lieutenant Philip M. Barnes, of the 1st Ordnance Squadron as assistant weaponeer on the B-29 Bockscar. Walter Goodman and Lawrence H. Johnston were on board the instrumentation aircraft, The Great Artiste. Leonard Cheshire and William Penney were on the observation plane Big <b>Stink.</b> Robert Serber was supposed to be on board but was left behind by the aircraft commander because he had forgotten his parachute.|$|E
5|$|William Penney, {{one of the}} Tube Alloys scientists, was {{an expert}} in shock waves.

5|$|The Kat {{then began}} an {{on-screen}} rivalry with Terri Runnels, although neither were fully trained wrestlers. At WrestleMania 2000, Runnels (accompanied by The Fabulous Moolah) defeated The Kat (with Mae Young) in a catfight. Val Venis was the special guest referee, {{but he was}} distracted during the match when Young kissed him, which allowed Moolah to pull The Kat out of the ring. When Venis saw {{her out of the}} ring, he declared Runnels the winner. Post-match, The Kat attacked Runnels by stripping off her pants to expose her thong. The feud continued, and the duo had an arm wrestling match at Insurrextion. Carter was victorious, but after the match, Runnels pulled The Kat's top off, exposing her breasts, which Carter allowed instead of acting disgusted or embarrassed. The two women continued to feud throughout the summer, often in mixed tag matches. In June 2000, Carter attempted to regain the Women's Championship by entering a battle royal to become the #1 contender, but she was eliminated by her rival Terri. The feud resurfaced in a 'Thong <b>Stink</b> Face' match at SummerSlam, which The Kat won by performing a stinkface on Runnels.|$|E
5|$|The Little Boy pre-assemblies were {{designated}} L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4, L-5, L-6, L-7, and L-11. L-1, L-2, L-5, and L-6 were expended in test drops. The first drop test {{was conducted with}} L-1 on 23 July 1945. It was dropped over the sea near Tinian {{in order to test}} the radar altimeter by the B-29 later known as Big <b>Stink,</b> piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, the commander of the 509th Composite Group. Two more drop tests over the sea were made on 24 and 25 July, using the L-2 and L-5 units in order to test all components. Tibbets was the pilot for both missions, but this time the bomber used was the one subsequently known as Jabit. L-6 was used as a dress rehearsal on 29 July. The B-29 Next Objective, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney, flew to Iwo Jima, where emergency procedures for loading the bomb onto a standby aircraft were practiced. This rehearsal was repeated on 31 July, but this time L-6 was reloaded onto a different B-29, Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, and the bomb was test dropped near Tinian. L-11 was the assembly used for the Hiroshima bomb.|$|E
