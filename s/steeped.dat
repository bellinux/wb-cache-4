5|$|George Reid {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were <b>steeped</b> in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Steep</b> {{problems}} {{are common in}} lung cancer survivors, yet {{little is known about}} the prevalence, determinants, and effects on quality of life (QoL) of these <b>steep</b> problems in tong-term Lung cancer survivors. Methods: A case-control study design comparing 76 elderly lung cancer survivors (LCS, > 5 years post diagnosis with mean survival time of 8 years +/- 2. 1 years) and 78 elderly non-cancer controls (NCC). Measurements included a standardized questionnaire for <b>steep</b> (Pittsburgh <b>Steep</b> Quality Index-PSQI), and analogue scales for dyspnea, pain, and other comorbid symptoms, as well as demographic factors and cancer history. Results: Overall, 56. 6 % of LCS had poor <b>steep</b> (PSQI global score > 5) as compared to only 29. 5 % of NCC (p < 0. 001), and 49. 2 % of LCS who did not have <b>steep</b> difficulties prior to their lung cancer diagnosis ultimately developed them. There was also evidence of significant impairments in <b>steep</b> efficiency in LCS (78. 3 %) relative to NCC (89. 6 %, p < 0. 001), predominantly due to increased nocturnal awakenings. A single-item analogue scale for <b>steep</b> quality was not as effective in identifying <b>steep</b> problems as more specific questions about <b>steep</b> duration and <b>steep</b> efficiency. Poor <b>steep</b> quality was significantly correlated with impairments in quality of life, even when controlling for other factors, such as dyspnea. Conclusions: Even 8 years after diagnosis, LCS continue to have significant <b>steep</b> difficulties. By asking specific questions about <b>steep</b> medication use, nocturnal awakenings and <b>steep</b> efficiency, health care providers can identify <b>steep</b> problems that could be treated and potentially improve the quality of life of their patients.

5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Wilhelm Mommsen and Arthur Rosenberg, {{oppose the}} idea that Frederick could have, or would have, liberalized Germany. They believe {{that he would not}} have dared to oppose both his father and Bismarck to change Germany's course; a natural soldier, he was <b>steeped</b> in his family's strong military tradition, and had happily reported to his father since he joined the army at the age of ten. Andreas Dorpalen notes that Frederick had complied with most of William's and Bismarck's policies early in his life, and would have been unlikely to change his behaviour. According to Arthur Rosenberg, despite his liberal tendencies Frederick still firmly believed in Bismarck and his system, with Dorpalen adding that in any case Frederick had too weak and ineffectual a character to have brought about real change, regardless of how long he reigned. James J. Sheehan states that the political climate and party system of Germany during that period were too <b>steeped</b> in the old ways for Frederick to overcome with liberalization. Dorpalen also observes that Frederick's liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany, and he points out that the many mistakes made by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in a more favorable light.|$|E

5|$|Le Père Goriot {{begins in}} June 1819, {{following}} Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, after the House of Bourbon had been {{restored to the}} throne of France.

5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either <b>steeped</b> in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} (cave hyena subspecies) is {{depicted}} in {{a few examples of}} Upper Palaeolithic rock art in France. A painting from the Chauvet Cave depicts a hyena outlined and represented in profile, with two legs, with its head and front part with well distinguishable spotted coloration pattern. Because of the specimen's <b>steeped</b> profile, it is thought that the painting was originally meant to represent a cave bear, but was modified as a hyena. In Lascaux, a red and black rock painting of a hyena is present in the part of the cave known as the Diverticule axial, and {{is depicted in}} profile, with four limbs, showing an animal with a steep back. The body and the long neck have spots, including the flanks. An image on a cave in Ariège shows an incompletely outlined and deeply engraved figure, representing a part of an elongated neck, smoothly passing into part of the animal’s forelimb on the proximal side. Its head is in profile, with a possibly re-engraved muzzle. The ear is typical of the spotted hyena, as it is rounded. An image in the Le Gabillou Cave in Dordogne shows a deeply engraved zoomorphic figure with a head in frontal view and an elongated neck with part of the forelimb in profile. It has large round eyes and short, rounded ears which are set far from each other. It has a broad, line-like mouth that evokes a smile. Though originally thought to represent a composite or zoomorphic hybrid, it is probable it is a spotted hyena based on its broad muzzle and long neck.|$|E
