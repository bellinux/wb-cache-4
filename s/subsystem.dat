To this end, Arwinss uses Wine's GDI32 and USER32 libraries with few changes to take fuller advantage of Wine's existing software compatibility. Arwinss also allows the user to optionally use a remote X server instead of a local display.|$|E

40|$|Many {{products}} are built from {{more or less}} independently developed sub-systems. For instance, a car consists of <b>subsystems</b> for transmission, braking, suspension, etc. These <b>subsystems</b> are frequently controlled by an embedded computer system. In the automotive industry, {{as well as in}} other application domains, there is currently a trend from an approach where <b>subsystems</b> have dedicated computer hardware and other resources (a federated approach) to an approach where <b>subsystems</b> share hardware and other resources (an integrated approach). This is motivated by a strong pressure to reduce product cost, {{at the same time as}} an increasing number of <b>subsystems</b> are being introduced. When integrating <b>subsystems,</b> it is desirable that guarantees valid before integration are also valid after integration, since this would eliminate the need for costly reverifications.

5|$|In DragonFly, each CPU {{has its own}} thread scheduler.

Ideally, all knowledge should be preserved, but since projects only have limited resources, and software systems continuously grow in scope and complexity, one needs to prioritize the <b>subsystems</b> and development periods for which knowledge preservation is more urgent. For example, core <b>subsystems</b> on which the majority of other <b>subsystems</b> build are obviously prime candidates for preservation, yet if these <b>subsystems</b> change contin-uously, picking a development period to start knowledge preservation and to maintain knowledge for over time become very hard. This paper exploits the time dependence between code changes to automatically determine for which <b>subsystems</b> and develop-ment periods of a software project knowledge preservation would be most valuable. A case study on two large open source projects (PostgreSQL and FreeBSD) shows that the most valuable <b>subsystems</b> to preserve knowledge for are large core <b>subsystems.</b> However, the majority of these <b>subsystems</b> (1) are continuously foundational, i. e., ide-ally for each development period knowledge should be preserved, and (2) experience substantial changes, i. e., preserving knowledge requires substantial effort...|$|R
