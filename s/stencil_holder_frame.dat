By specify examples and on the basis of having administered the pull test of bolt (anchor), the article has calculated and analyzed the stress distribution rule of metal <b>holder</b> in anchor <b>frame</b> combination supporting structure according to the statically indeterminate principle in solid mechanics. In contrast to single metal holder structure, the consequence comes to be that the bearing capacity was significantly increased.

40|$|In the United States as elsewhere, {{having no}} valid visa or {{residence}} permit {{has played a}} key role in the long-term civic precariousness of unauthorized transnational migrants. However, the distinct U. S. regime of illegality has allowed undocumented residents there to enjoy a range of citizenship rights contrasting with Western Europe’s more repressive regimes. Indeed, illegal immigrants have integrated U. S. society, bureaucratic system, and labor market in ways that cannot entirely be grasped by opposing formal exclusion on the one hand, and informal incorporation or subjective legitimacy on the other. Though inferior, their concrete citizenship condition includes many formal elements, at the local and national levels. Such an advanced normalization of illegality has increased the institutionalization of unauthorized migrants’ inferior status: never being completely "non-citizens," they have grown into a class of "sub-citizens," whose self-discipline, bureaucratic stability, and fiscal participation, have been encouraged by reasonable promises of amnesty. These promises were regularly reiterated but, since 1986 in the case of Mexicans, repeatedly postponed. In this context, "illegality" has not come up as an absolute marker of illegitimacy, but rather as one more handicap within a continuum of probationary citizenship. However, as irregular migrants sometimes have to commit more infractions in order to reach the most formal of common civic attributes, the social meaning of the latter has proved ultimately undetermined, for their <b>holders</b> can be <b>framed</b> as "more illegal" as much as "more legal. ...|$|R
40|$|Advances in the {{electronics}} sector, medicine and material sciences {{have increased the}} need for inspection tools {{that are able to}} resolve fine images of surface topography. Nowadays, the measurement limit reaches values far below 100 nanometer, towards the subnanometre level. For some applications, a high image resolution is sufficient. For industrial applications, however, also accurate quantitative information about the surface is required. Atomic force microscopes (AFMs) are measurement instruments, which are commonly used for the characterisation of surface topography at nanometre level. Commercial devices, however, show significant measurement uncertainty due to thermal drift of the frame and due to creep, hysterisis and nonlinear response of the piezoscanner. Moreover, regular calibration is needed in order to maintain traceability to the length standard. Metrological atomic force microscopes (mAFMs) have a frame of interferometers as a metrology system. Since the wavelength of the interferometer laser source is related to the definition of the metre, these devices are able to produce measurements directly traceable to the length standard. Therefore, metrological AFMs currently represent the primary standard for nanometre level measurements in a number of countries. These devices are able to transfer their traceability to commercial AFMs, used in industry. The calibration procedure typically makes use of transfer standards. These nanostructured samples are measured by means of a mAFM and the commercial AFM of interest. By comparing the images, it is possible to calibrate the commercial AFM. In collaboration with the Federal Public Service Economy, SMEs, Self-Employed and Energy (Metrology - National Standards, SMD-ENS), a mAFM has been developed in this research, with a target accuracy of +/- 1 nanometer (coverage factor k= 2) over a range of 100 micrometer (in x-,y- and z-directions). The aimed measurement range specifications in x- and y-directions are typical for widely used medium range AFM applications. However, in contrast to most mAFMs with a medium measurement range, the device presented in this research has an increased z-range (100 micrometer instead of 20 micrometer). This makes it suitable for three dimensional measurements, which are gaining importance in nanometrology. Critical components of the presented mAFM also show a highly dedicated design in order to achieve mechanical and thermal stability. Furthermore, the design follows the Abbe principle for obtaining maximum accuracy. An evaluation has been done by means of a detailed uncertainty budget and a series of simulations and experiments. -Introduction -General design of the mAFM -Sources of errors -Metrology <b>frame</b> -Sample <b>holder</b> -Positioning <b>frame</b> -Probe mount -Component alignment and mAFM controller -System overview and performance -Prototype development -Conclusionnrpages: 216 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{conduct of}} {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass surgery requires {{the use of}} equipment and devices like the oxygenator. The oxygenator comes in different makes and each manufacturer customizes the carrier or ′holder′ of this device specific to their design. Aim: This paper presents an innovation designed to overcome the need to purchase a different holder for every oxygenator thereby cutting the cost. Materials and Methods: A sheet of iron measuring 1. 9 cm (width) × 0. 1 cm (thickness) was used to design the <b>holder</b> circular main <b>frame.</b> Another sheet measuring 2 cm (width) × 0. 6 cm (thickness) × 24 cm (length) was used to construct a V-shaped handle with the arms of the V attached to the main frame 7 cm apart. At the narrow base of the handle is a latch requiring two 13 -gauge screws to attach the holder to the heart-lung machine. Within the circumference of the main frame are four T-shaped side arms which grip the oxygenator; located at 2, 5, 7 and 11 O′clock positions. The stem of the T consist of a 0. 6 cm (thickness) × 13 cm (length) rod drilled through the main frame. The cross of the T consists of variable lengths of the same sheet as the mainframe attached to the stem by a screw mechanism. At the base of the T, is attached a circular handle (4 cm in diameter) made of 0. 4 cm iron rod. Result: An oxygenator holder which weighs 1. 75 kg with a total length of 54 cm (the diameter of the mainframe is 30 cm). Its advantages include (i) affordability, (ii) materials are locally accessible, (iii) versatility (iv) reproducibility. The disadvantages include, (i) it requires some time to fit, (ii) caution is required in fitting the oxygenator to avoid breakage, (iii) a spanner is required to lock the latch. Conclusion: The concept of a universal holder is pertinent, especially in resource poor environments to avoid purchasing a new holder whenever the usual oxygenator common to the centre is unavailable. This device is amenable to further modifications to meet the unforeseen challenges...|$|R
40|$|Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), aliens may {{petition}} for {{judicial review of}} an adverse decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) {{as long as that}} decision constitutes a “final order of removal. ” Usually {{it is not difficult to}} ascertain when an alien should file her petition: the thirty-day statutory filing deadline begins to run when the Board issues a decision that affirms the immigration judge’s removal order in its entirety. In some cases, however, an alien seeks multiple forms of relief from removal in a single proceeding. When that occurs, some forms of relief might be granted, while others are denied or require a remand to the immigration judge for further proceedings. This hybrid “mixed” decision often leaves aliens and attorneys wondering when the removal order becomes final, and thus when they should file a {{petition for}} review. When the Board issues its decision? Or at the conclusion of the remanded proceedings? Which order constitutes the “final order of removal” for purposes of judicial review? The implications are profound. If an alien misses the correct deadline, she may lose her ability to challenge the denial of relief from removal. Alternatively, if she files the petition too soon, the court may dismiss it as premature, which consumes time and resources for the alien, the courts, and the government alike. Unfortunately, neither the statute nor the decisions of the courts of appeals provides clear guidance on this question. Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit has recently issued an important en banc decision on finality for purposes of judicial review that provides a useful starting point from which to clarify this convoluted area of law. This Article is an attempt to bring clarity to the issue of finality for purposes of judicial review. Using the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Abdisalan v. <b>Holder</b> as a <b>frame</b> of reference, the Article addresses how the INA and its implementing regulations contemplate “finality,” while also highlighting the conflicting manner in which the courts of appeals have thus far treated finality. This Article then proceeds to consider the Ninth Circuit’s en banc decision in Abdisalan, noting its importance in establishing a more or less uniform definition of finality within that circuit, while also exploring some concerns about the scope and limitations of that decision. Finally, to address broader inconsistencies amongst courts of appeals, this Article proposes two possibilities for reform: (1) a uniform definition of finality adopted across the courts of appeals; and (2) statutory reform that would define specifically and exhaustively what constitutes a final order of removal for purposes of judicial review...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} for sample preparation and trace analysis of organic pollutants in water using mixed-phase thin film (MPTF) devices, combined with direct thermal desorption, cold trapping, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is presented {{for the first}} time. Two novel analytical devices, Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) and polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) TF samplers were fabricated using spin coating technique and glass wool fabric mesh as substrate. The samplers were easily tailored in size and shape by cutting tools. Good durability and flat-shape stability were observed during extractions and stirring in water. The latter characteristic obviates {{the need for an}} extra <b>framed</b> <b>holder</b> for rapid thin film microextraction (TFME) and makes the samplers more robust and user-friendly. The analytical performance of the MPTF devices was satisfactorily illustrated and compared with those of solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers and PDMS thin film membrane using water samples spiked with seven N–nitrosamines (NAs), known as disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water. Marked enhancement of extraction efficiencies (typically more than one order of magnitude) for the N-nitrosamines, including the hydrophilic ones, was obtained with the MPTF devices under generally pre-equilibrium conditions, compared to the SPME fibers and PDMS thin film membrane. The analytical results obtained in this study, including linearity, repeatability and detection levels at low ng/L for the tested compounds, indicate that the new thin film devices are promising for rapid sampling and sample preparation of trace levels of polar organic pollutants in water with sensitivities higher than SPME fibers and with a wide application range typical of mixed-phase coatings. The user-friendly format and robustness of the novel devices are also advantageous for on-site applications, which is the ultimate use of thin film samplers. Moreover, the thin film fabrication approach developed in this study offers the possibility of making other novel samplers with PDMS or different absorptive polymers such as polyacrylate (PA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as particle-free, or as particle-loaded thin films with a variety of adsorptive solid particles. In another development {{in the course of this}} research, the performance and accuracy of the SPME fiber approach for sample preparation of selected DBPs were demonstrated and compared with the conventional liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) method by real drinking water samples analysis in collaboration with Health Canada. Four regulated trihalomethanes (THMs) and seven other DBPs known as priority by-products, including four haloacetonitriles, two haloketones and chloropicrin, were analyzed in real samples during two separate comparative studies. In each study, duplicate samples from several water treatment and distribution systems in Canada, collected and stabilized under the same protocol, were analyzed in parallel by two independent labs; in the University of Waterloo by an optimized headspace SPME-GC-MS and in Health Canada by a LLE-GC-ECD (electron capture detection) method equivalent to EPA 551. 1. The values for the concentration of the analytes in the samples obtained by the two methods were in good agreement with each other in majority of the cases indicating that SPME affords the promise of a dependable sample preparation technique for rapid DBPs analysis. In particular, it was shown that the SPME fiber approach combined with GC-MS is a fast reliable alternative to the LLE-GC-ECD (EPA 551. 1) method for analysis of the regulated THMs in the concentration ranges that are typical and relevant for drinking water samples. 1 yea...|$|R
