500|$|Wilson, {{a gentleman}} scientist, is {{the protagonist of}} Don't Starve. While Wilson has no special {{abilities}} beyond growth of [...] "a magnificent beard", which slows the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> in winter, and accelerates overheating in summer, other playable characters do; a few examples follow. Willow, a firestarter, is immune to fire damage and will start a small fire on the ground, which can set fire to nearby objects, when she has a low sanity level. A girl named Wendy receives visits from her deceased twin sister Abigail when summoned. A strongman named Wolfgang has higher health, offensive capabilities that grow the more his hunger meter is full, but starves faster and loses more sanity when near danger. WX78 is an android who nonetheless needs to eat, sleep, and stay mentally stimulated, but does not become ill from spoiled food, can increase its maximum health, hunger, and sanity with gears (which are reset to the original maximum after dying and respawning, but the corpse leaves behind {{a portion of the}} used ones), and takes damage from rain. WX-78 also attracts lightning, being made of conductible material, that makes it surrounded by a glow, which gradually decreases with time as the charge wears off, refills health, and lowers sanity while continuing to speed the loss of it.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} vacuum {{dehydration}} of protein by Shackell in 1909 (1), {{the technique of}} drying from the frozen state at reduced pressures has become an important laboratory procedure. This technique (lyophilization) is used today {{for the preservation of}} morphological structures, biochemical characteristics, and physiological activities of many biological materials (2 - 5). Bacteriologists and virologists {{were among the first to}} use freeze-drying as a method for preserving infective agents. The various methods of vacuum sublimation employed resulted in dried bacteria and viruses which were, in most instances, viable on rehydration, but little effort was made to obtain maximum survival. Only recently have attempts been made to determine the effects of such factors as <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> and time, rate, and degree of drying on the survival of bacteria (6 - 9). Much of the work employing the freeze-drying technique has been carried out with instruments having limited versatility and designed with limited objectives (9 - 14). Many "freeze-driers " are unsatisfactory for the desiccatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{freezing}} stage governs several critical {{parameters of the}} freeze drying process {{and the quality of}} the resulting lyophilized products. This paper presents an integrated ultrasonic transducer (UT) in a stainless steel bottle and its application to real-time diagnostics of the water freezing process. The sensor was directly deposited onto the stainless steel bottle using a sol-gel spray technique. It could operate at temperature range from − 100 to 400 °C and uses an ultrasonic pulse-echo technique. The progression of the freezing process, including water-in, freezing point and final phase change of water, were all clearly observed using ultrasound. The ultrasonic signals could indicate the three stages of the freezing process and evaluate the cooling and freezing periods under various processing conditions. The temperature was also adopted for evaluating the cooling and freezing periods. These periods increased with water volume and decreased with shelf temperature (i. e., <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>freezing).</b> This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the ultrasonic sensor and technology for diagnosing and optimizing the process of water freezing to save energy...|$|E

40|$|Freezing depth is one {{the most}} {{important}} climatic parameters for indices applied in various fields such as agriculture and civil engineering. The parameter <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> depth depends on different factors including astronomical, surface air temperature, humidity; soil characteristics such as texture, heat capacity, thermal conductivity and specific heat. This study investigated the effect of air temperature on freezing depth. Apparatus able to reach temperatures of - 16 ˚C {{was set up to}} test soil freezing points. To measure and record soil temperature at depths of 10, 20, 50, and 70 cm, an automatic measurement system was designed. The system’s sensors included an electronic thermostat, inserted at various different soil depths. Variations of temperature measured by the sensors were transferred to a transformer and these measurements were then transferred to a computer as binary codes. These codes were then processed by a computer program and converted to a numerical format. After calibration, several experiments were conducted using soil bins of different textures including clay, clay-sand and sand, at percentage moisture contents of 0, 10, and 15 %. Results of tests showed that <b>freezing</b> depth <b>of</b> soil in a dry state (0 % moisture content) for soil with smaller pores (such as clay) was less than that of soil with larger pores (such as sand). The advancing <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>freezing</b> front had a similar trend. By increasing soil moisture (0 % to 10 %), for all soil samples, the depth <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> and the advancing <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>freezing</b> front increased. This condition was more pronounced in soil with finer texture than in soil with coarser texture. By increasing the amount of soil moisture content, clay soil maintained its moisture throughout depth, but in sandy and clay-sandy soil, the moisture content decreased from the top to the bottom (due to drainage). This phenomenon affected the advancing <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>freezing</b> front in these soil samples. Finally, the correlation between the time <b>of</b> soil <b>freezing</b> (t), and the temperature at different depths during the freezing process (T), was investigated, and it was concluded that this can be written in the form of{ }, significant at 1 % level for all three types of soil...|$|R
50|$|The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>freezing</b> has {{a direct}} impact on the size and the number of ice {{crystals}} formed within a food product's cells and extracellular space. Slow freezing leads to fewer but larger ice crystals while fast freezing leads to smaller but more numerous ice crystals. Large ice crystals can puncture the walls of the cells of the food product which will cause a degradation of the texture of the product as well as the loss of its natural juices during thawing. That is why there will be a qualitative difference observed between food products frozen by ventilated mechanical freezing, non-ventilated mechanical freezing or cryogenic freezing with liquid nitrogen.|$|R
40|$|Populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC 366, grown anaerobically under {{conditions}} {{that lead to}} enrichment of membranes with specific sterols and fatty-acyl residues, were subjected to freeze-thaw cycles and cold-shock stress. One freeze-thaw cycle caused considerable loss in viability, the loss being greater with organisms enriched in campesterol or cholesterol rather than ergosterol or stigmasterol. Retention of viability was greater in populations enriched in linoleyl rather than oleyl residues. Organisms enriched in ergosterol and either oleyl or cetoleyl residues were equally susceptible to death following freeze-thaw cycles, but less so than organisms enriched in palmitoleyl residues. <b>Speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> {{had little effect on}} retention of viability in organisms enriched in ergosterol and linoleyl residues, but an effect was observed in populations enriched in cholesterol and linoleyl residues. In populations enriched in ergosterol and linoleyl residues, sodium chloride protected against loss of viability, whereas in organisms enriched in cholesterol and linoleyl residues the salt rendered populations more susceptible to death following freezing and thawing. Resistance to cold-shock stress was also greater in populations enriched in ergosterol or stigmasterol rather than campesterol or cholesterol, and with organisms enriched in linoleyl rather than oleyl residues...|$|E

Today {{is the only}} method used for sperm storage, whether {{for the purposes of}} assisted reproduction, or for scientific purposes. However, this method has a negative impact on such stored cells and is therefore still a subject of many studies. Among the main causes of sperm damage in rodents there are inappropriately selected cryoprotective agents, poor or no elimination of oxidative stress generated during cryopreservation, as well as a poorly chosen <b>speed</b> and temperature <b>of</b> <b>freezing.</b> Correctly chosen procedures and the composition of the media in which sperm are stored, can significantly affect the quality of sperm.

40|$|SiC {{structures}} with porosities ranging between 20 – 60 % {{have been}} fabricated using two methods emulsification and freeze casting. While emulsification results in foam-like isotropic materials with interconnected pores, freeze casting {{can be used}} to fabricate highly anisotropic materials with characteristic layered architectures. The parameters that control the pore size and final porosity have been identified (solid content in the initial suspensions, emulsification times or <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>freezing</b> front). We have found that liquid state sintering (suing Al 2 O 3 and Y 2 O 3 as additives) at 1800 °C on a powder (SiC/Al 2 O 3) bed provides optimum consolidation for the porous structures. The mechanical strength of the materials depends on their density.

40|$|Nowadays, It is easy {{to define}} optimal {{conditions}} (cryoprotective agent, <b>speed</b> and steps <b>of</b> <b>freezing,</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> warming) for the cryopreservation of a homogeneous cell population or a one cell-layer tissue. Meanwhile, It is still hard to obtain cryopreservation of composite organs. Each tissue has its own requirements and its own reactivity to the cryopreservation process. The challenge consists of, on the one hand, to select the ideal combination of cryoprotective agents that can fit {{the needs of the}} different tissues, and the definition of adequate technical parameters, on the other hand. All the experimental trials have studied the survival rate of non-vascularized cryopreserved tissues. The aim of our experimental work is to demonstrate the feasibility of cryopreserving a composite organ with its nutrient vessels “artery and veins” in order after thawing to revitalize it by reestablishing the blood irrigation by microsurgical vascular anastomosis. We report our experimental results on the cryopreservation of composite organs—amputated digits—xenotransplanted in the rabbit. Digital segments were cryopreserved, then revitalized after warming using vascular microsurgical techniques. Preliminary results are encouraging and may pave the way in the future to the microvascular allotransplantation of cryopreserved composite organs...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> on both within-batch (inter-vial) and within- product (intra-vial) heterogeneity. This {{analysis}} {{has been carried out}} using two freezing protocols, the conventional shelf-ramped method and the Vacuum Induced Surface Freezing, and placebo formulations containing both crystallizing (mannitol) and amorphous (lactose and sucrose) excipients. The freezing conditions (i. e., the temperature <b>of</b> <b>freezing,</b> the temperature and time of the equilibration phase, and the filling volume) were found to have a dramatic impact on both the within-batch and the within-product homogeneity.

Various physiological parameters [electrolyte leakage, Fv/Fm ratio (efficiency of PSII), MDA test (an indicator of lipid peroxidation), and histochemical detection of ROS (i. e. superoxide (O 2 -) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) ] were quantified. Based on the LT 50 of spinach (approximately - 5. 5 Â°C), - 4 and - 4. 5 Â°C were selected as two sub-lethal temperatures for prolonged freezing test, but only - 4. 5 Â°C for post-thaw recovery test. Enhanced ion-leakage, increased MDA content, accumulated ROS and decreased Fv/Fm ratio were observed in freeze-thaw injured spinach tissues subjected to four duration (0. 5, 3. 0, 5. 5 and 10. 5 h) <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> at both - 4 and - 4. 5 Â°C; however, all measurements were shown to be worse at - 4. 5 Â°C than - 4. 0 Â°C during four durations <b>of</b> <b>freezing.</b> For the post-thaw recovery test, spinach tissues frozen for relatively short-term duration <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> at - 4. 5 Â°C was recoverable during post-thaw periods, but was irrecoverable when stressed by a longer duration <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> at the same temperature.
