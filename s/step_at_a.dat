25|$|CP/M {{came with}} a Dynamic Debugging Tool, nicknamed DDT (after the insecticide, i.e. a bug-killer), which allowed memory and program modules to be {{examined}} and manipulated, and allowed a program to be executed one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time.|$|E
25|$|When set {{in motion}} on a stepped {{platform}} such as a stairway, the slinky transfers energy along its length in a longitudinal wave. The whole spring descends end over end in a periodical motion, {{as if it were}} somersaulting down one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time.|$|E

25|$|A* is an {{informed}} search algorithm, or a best-first search, {{meaning that it}} solves problems by searching among all possible paths to the solution (goal) for the one that incurs the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.), and among these paths it first considers the ones that appear to lead most quickly to the solution. It is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific node of a graph, it constructs a tree of paths starting from that node, expanding paths one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, until one of its paths ends at the predetermined goal node.|$|E
25|$|An unmoved pawn {{can move}} one step, {{up to the}} middle of the board (in the case of the 16×16 board, the eighth rank), or {{anything}} in between. Thus, 1.i8 is a legal opening move, and so are 1.i3, 1.i4, 1.i5, 1.i6, and 1.i7. Once it has moved for the first time, it can only make one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. (In the case of an 8×8 board, this is exactly the same as in standard chess). Such a long initial pawn move allows the moving pawn to be captured en passant by an enemy pawn as if it had stopped on any one of the squares it had passed through.|$|E
500|$|The {{ninth and}} tenth tracks are [...] "Lullaby", {{performed}} by the Dixie Chicks, and Rosanne Cash's acoustic version of [...] "Motherless Children" [...] (1927), a blues standard originally recorded by Blind Willie Johnson. Following are Crow's [...] "Lullaby for Wyatt", Lopez's [...] "One <b>Step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Time", and [...] "The Last Laugh" [...] by Karen Elson. Closing the album are [...] "Petit Poulet", performed by Sinéad O'Connor, and Wainwright's cover of Bob Marley and the Wailers [...] "No Woman, No Cry". Wainwright recorded both of her tracks weeks after giving birth prematurely, while her baby was still in an incubator.|$|E

500|$|Sparks' self-titled debut studio {{album was}} {{released}} in November2007. The album debuted at number 10 on the US Billboard 200 chart, and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). [...] "Tattoo" [...] and [...] "No Air" [...] were released as the album's first and second singles, respectively. Both songs reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and received platinum certifications. [...] "One <b>Step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Time" [...] was released as the third single, and became a top 20 song in multiple countries worldwide.

500|$|Some evangelicals criticized Zacharias' {{decision}} not to use this opportunity to directly address the [...] "deep and foundational" [...] differences between the historic Christian faith {{and that of the}} LDS church. He responded by asserting that Christians should not immediately condemn Mormonism's theological differences but [...] "graciously build one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time in communicating our faith with clarity and conviction". He said this is just as effective as showing someone the faults of their faith. The speaking engagement was nearly sabotaged by a claim by event organizer Greg Johnson, president of Standing Together, that Zacharias {{had nothing to do with}} editing the book The Kingdom of the Cults and had only loaned his name to the latest edition. Johnson later apologized for his comment.|$|E
500|$|Mendes had Spacey and Bening in {{mind for}} the leads from the beginning, but DreamWorks {{executives}} were unenthusiastic. The studio suggested several alternatives, including Bruce Willis, Kevin Costner, or John Travolta to play Lester, and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play Carolyn. Mendes did not want a big star [...] "weighing the film down"; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The Usual Suspects and Seven, and 1992's Glengarry Glen Ross. Spacey was surprised; he said, [...] "I usually play characters who are very quick, very manipulative and smart. [...] I usually wade in dark, sort of treacherous waters. This is a man living one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, playing by his instincts. This is actually much closer to me, to what I am, than those other parts." [...] Mendes offered Bening the role of Carolyn without the studio's consent; although executives were upset at Mendes, by September 1998, DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Bening.|$|E

2500|$|Sparks' first non-American Idol single {{was the top}} hit (peaking {{at number}} eight) [...] "Tattoo", which {{received}} platinum certification. Her second single was the Billboard Hot 100 number three hit [...] "No Air" [...] with Chris Brown. The song went to number one in several countries, and also topped Billboard's Pop Airplay chart. [...] "No Air" [...] had been certified platinum in April but recently passed the 3 million copies mark. It stands as the best-selling single by any Idol contestant. Sparks released a third single off her album, [...] "One <b>Step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Time", which peaked at number 17. [...] "One <b>Step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Time" [...] has so far sold over a million copies and is certified platinum. Sparks released her second album Battlefield in July 2009. The album's title track became Jordin's fifth top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 10. This makes Jordin Sparks the only American Idol contestant to have their first five singles become Top 20 Hits.|$|E
2500|$|Since her win in 2007, Sparks has {{returned}} to Idol six times. She performed twice on the seventh season of American Idol, once on the Idol Gives Back results show singing [...] "No Air" [...] with Chris Brown and again with [...] "One <b>Step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Time" [...] on May 21, 2008, for the finale.

6000|$|... "I will!" [...] {{answered}} Tom, and {{ran down}} the stairs three <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. He looked up {{at the front of the}} house but saw nothing unusual. Then he dashed to the rear.|$|R

2500|$|Monads allow a {{programming}} style where {{programs are}} written by putting together highly composable parts, combining in flexible ways the possible actions {{that can work}} on {{a particular type of}} data. As such, monads have been described as [...] "programmable semicolons"; a semicolon is the operator used to chain together individual statements in many imperative programming languages, thus the expression implies that extra code will be executed between the actions in the pipeline. Monads have also been explained with a physical metaphor as assembly lines, where a conveyor belt transports data between functional units that transform it one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time.|$|E
2500|$|The album's third single, [...] "One <b>Step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Time", was {{released}} in June 2008. It peaked at number seventeen on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Sparks her fourth top twenty hit on the chart. This makes Sparks the only American Idol contestant to have her first four singles reach the top twenty of the Hot 100. It also charted in the top twenty in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. In New Zealand, the song reached number two and was certified gold by the RIANZ. In August 2008, Sparks co-headlined the Jesse & Jordin LIVE Tour with Jesse McCartney in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|David Brooks has {{questioned}} whether children in distant countries {{should be treated}} as having equal moral value to nearby children. He claims that morality should be [...] "internally ennobling". Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry warns about the [...] "measurement problem", stating in some areas, such as medical research, or helping to reform third-world governance [...] "one grinding <b>step</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time", are hard to measure with controlled cost-effectiveness experiments and risk being undervalued by the effective altruism movement. In the Stanford Social Innovation Review, Ken Berger and Robert Penna of Charity Navigator condemned effective altruism's practice of [...] "weighing causes and beneficiaries against one another", calling this [...] "moralistic, in the worst sense of the word".|$|E

6000|$|He {{returned}} {{about seven}} {{in a state}} of nervous apprehension; came upstairs two <b>steps</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, and stopped breathless on the landing. He gulped as he came in, and his eyes were painfully eager. [...] "She's been?" [...] he asked.|$|R
