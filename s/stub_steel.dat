40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} angles in {{concrete}} {{has become one}} of the menacing problems on durability aspects, which influence the service life of the structures. The life cycle cost of transmission tower foundations, which are corrosion prone has increasingly, become difficult to manage. Failures in their transmission line components amounts to thousands of dollars only in maintenance costs apart from other related expenditures. Many of these failures are corrosion related due to the exposure of the system materials to aggressive atmospheric and/or soil environments. Transmission line towers running close to coastal area are attacked by chlorides and sulphates and the towers in the vicinity of chemical, petro chemical, fertilizer and other industries are subjected to aggressive chemical attacks. Because of the extreme climate conditions prevailing in certain areas, transmission line tower stubs/coping/muffing concrete have been severely deteriorated and stub angle were corroded very much. During submergence of <b>stub</b> <b>steel</b> above concrete chimney for some period in rainy season, water acting as salt dissolved electrolyte, the corrosion process is aggravated particularly in the presence of chlorides and phosphates. A mechanism of pitting or crevice corrosion will initially occur in the presence of aggressive chloride ions [...] Application of Protective coating to steel angles and addition of admixtures to the concrete is one of the best method of controlling corrosion in steel angle. Effect of providing coatings on stub angle, addition of admixtures in stub concrete, corrosion inhibitors and barrier coatings on stub concrete against corrosion had been investigated in the laboratory under accelerated environmental condition...|$|E

Assuming that concrete filled <b>steel</b> <b>stub</b> frame-shear wall is continuous elastic structure with infinite degree of freedom, free vibration equation is built. Furthermore, the effects of semi-rigid connection on natural periods and frequencies are studied. The formula to calculate the coefficient of natural periods is deduced. ANSYS is employed to determine the modal analysis. The results obtained from finite element analysis are consistent well with those obtained from formula. The results show that semi-rigid connections tend to increase the natural period. However, the effect on higher modes is negligible. The seismic design suggestions of the semi-rigid concrete filled <b>steel</b> <b>stub</b> frame-shear wall are proposed. The proposed methods may supply references for the engineers. ...|$|R

40|$|High {{phosphorus}} {{gray iron}} (HPGI) {{is used to}} connect the <b>steel</b> <b>stub</b> of an anode rod to a prebaked anode carbon block in the aluminium reduction cells. The electrical resistance and resistivity properties, for different grades of cast iron, were tested and measured at different temperatures- using bench scale set ups- and evaluated as a potential replacement for the existing HPGI due to the limitations of that material. These cast iron alloys include low-phosphorus gray iron, ductile irons with compositions typical for ferritic (FDI), pearlitic (PDI) ductile iron grades and three alloys with low phosphorous irons with different carbon equivalents. The thermal expansion for <b>steel</b> <b>stub,</b> HPGI, and for the succeeded cast iron alloy was measured using high precision automatic dilatometer and analyzed. Microstructures and mechanical properties of the selected alloy were tested and compared with the existing HPGI. The results shown that, the contact pressure, at steel stub-cast iron collar-anode connection, plays the major {{role in determining the}} electrical resistance and hence the voltage drop. Gray iron with carbon equivalent= 4. 5 has the lowest electrical resistivities compared with the other tested cast iron alloys, meanwhile carbides in the as-cast structures seem to be beneficial in increasing the thermal expansion and hence the contact pressure during the anode service life. The saving percent in voltage drop between gray iron with carbon equivalent = 4. 5 and HPGI reached to 18 %.

The bridge cables are attached to two steel towers which stretch 210 ft above the stone piers. These stone piers along with concrete <b>stub</b> abutments and <b>steel</b> bents make up the substructure.

A {{series of tests}} was conducted to study the behavior of short composite columns under axial compressive load; the cross section dimensions were 100 × 70 × 2 [*]mm. A total of 20 stubs have been tested, as follows: 4 hollow thin welded tubes were tested to axial and eccentric load compression, 4 were filled with ordinary concrete appointed by BO columns, 6 were filled with concrete whose natural sand was completely substituted by a crystallized sand slag designated in this paper by BSI, and 6 were tucked in concrete whose natural sand was partially replaced by a crystallized sand slag called BSII. The main parameters studied are {{the height of the}} specimen (300 [*]mm– 500 [*]mm), eccentricity of load and type of filling concrete. Based on test results obtained, it is confirmed that the length of the tubes has a considerable effect on the bearing capacity and the failure mode.

40|$|Stainless steel {{exhibits}} highly non-linear behaviour, and in {{the case}} of short column structural members, this can lead to substantial conservatism in the prediction of load capacity by design codes due to their use of the 0. 2 % proof stress as an upper limit of capacity. This paper examines the behaviour of short stainless <b>steel</b> <b>stub</b> columns in which the material follows a Ramberg-Osgood type of stress-strain law. The column length is varied to examine the effects on the load capacity when the column is subjected to varying magnitudes of combined bending and axial compression loading. The loading is applied as eccentric axial loading, with the eccentricity being positive at one end and negative at the other to produce varying moments along the column under load. Two different methods of analysis are employed, (1) the ASCE design code using a Ramberg-Osgood stress-strain law combined with a full section moment capacity within the interaction formula with nominal levels of loading eccentricity, and (2), the same approach, but using the true eccentricity with reference to the unsupported length of the columns.

The experiment was performed on CHARAs. Two thawing protocols were tested: 1, CHARAs were thawed at a room temperature at + 23 °C; 2, CHARAs were placed directly into a water bath at + 37 °C. After fixation, all samples were washed in distilled water for 5 min, and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (70, 85, 95, and 100 %) for 5 min at each level.

40|$|Numerical {{study of}} {{concrete-filled}} <b>steel</b> composite (CFSC) <b>stub</b> columns with <b>steel</b> stiffeners {{is presented in}} this paper. The behaviour of the columns is examined {{by the use of}} the finite element software LUSAS. Results from nonlinear finite element analyses are compared with those from corresponding experimental tests which uncover the reasonable accuracy of the modelling. Novel steel stiffeners are used in the CFSC stub columns of this study. The columns are extensively developed considering three different special arrangements of the steel stiffeners with various number, spacing, and widths of the stiffeners. The main variables are: (1) arrangement of the steel stiffeners (C 1, C 2, and C 3); (2) number of the steel stiffeners (2 and 3); (3) spacing of the steel stiffeners (50 mm and 100 mm); (4) width of the steel stiffeners (50 mm, 75 mm, and 100 mm); (5) steel thickness (2 mm, 2. 5 mm, and 3 mm); (6) concrete compressive strength (30 MPa, 40 MPa, and 50. 1 MPa); (7) steel yield stress (234. 3 MPa, 350 MPa, and 450 MPa). Effects of the variables on the behaviour of the columns are assessed. Failure modes of the columns are also illustrated. It is concluded that the variables have considerable effects on the behaviour of the columns. Moreover, ultimate load capacities of the columns are predicted by the design code EC 4, suggested equation of other researchers, and proposed equation of the authors of this paper. The obtained ultimate load capacities from the analyses are compared with the predicted values. It concludes that EC 4 gives more conservative predictions than the equations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the behaviour of cold-formed stainless steel tubular structural members, {{with an emphasis}} on ferritic stainless steels. Owing to the high comparative expense of stainless steel relative to traditional carbon steel, this study aims to identify and develop means of utilising the material more efficiently. A comprehensive material test programme was carried out as part of an extensive study into the prediction of strength enhancements in cold-formed structural sections that arise during production. Material tests on a total of 51 flat coupons and 28 corner coupons, extracted from a total of 18 cross-sections formed {{from a wide range of}} materials, were performed. A new, simple and universal predictive model for harnessing the cold-formed induced strength enhancements was developed which offers, on average, 19 % and 36 % strength enhancements for the cross-section flat faces and corner regions, respectively, relative to the strength of the unformed material. Ferritic stainless steels, having no or very low nickel content, offer a more viable alternative for structural applications to the more commonly used austenitic stainless steels, reducing both the level and variability of the initial material cost. There is currently limited information available on the structural performance of this type of stainless steel. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, a series of material, cross-section and member tests have been performed on two ferritic grades - EN 1. 4003 and EN 1. 4509. The experimental results were used to assess the applicability of the current codified design provisions to ferritic stainless steel structural components. Moreover, the elevated temperature performance of ferritic stainless steels, covering the material response and the flexural buckling behaviour, was investigated through analysis of experimental and numerical results, leading to proposals for suitable design recommendations. Finally, simplifications and refinements to the recently developed continuous strength method (CSM) were made. Comparison of the predicted capacities with over 140 collected test results on stainless <b>steel</b> <b>stub</b> columns and cross-sections in bending shows that the CSM offers improved accuracy and reduced scatter relative to the current design methods. The reliability of the approach has been demonstrated by statistical analyses, enabling its use in structural design standards. Open Acces...|$|R
