5|$|Cetaceans {{are divided}} into two parvorders: the largest parvorder, Mysticeti (baleen whales), is {{characterized}} by the presence of baleen, a sieve-like structure in the upper jaw made of keratin, which it uses to filter plankton, among others, from the water; Odontocetes (toothed whales) are characterized by bearing <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth</b> for hunting, as opposed to their counterparts' baleen.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{is closely}} related to the much larger and more recent tyrannosaurid Tyrannosaurus rex. Like most tyrannosaurids, Daspletosaurus was a multi-tonne bipedal {{predator}} equipped with dozens of large, <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth.</b> Daspletosaurus had the small forelimbs typical of tyrannosaurids, although they were proportionately longer than in other genera.|$|E
5|$|Reports in {{the news}} media of dinosaur finds and dinosaur science are often {{inaccurate}} and sensationalistic, and popular dinosaur books usually lag scientific understanding.

5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} with tiny, two-fingered {{hands and}} a massive head that had dozens of large, <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth.</b> It may {{have been at the}} top of the food chain in its local ecosystem. While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds, {{by virtue}} {{of living in a}} geologically depositional {{environment}} (that is, in the sea where sediments are readily laid down), are well represented in the fossil record. They are first known to occur in the Cretaceous period, the earliest being the Hesperornithiformes, like Hesperornis regalis, a flightless loon-like seabird that could dive in a fashion similar to grebes and loons (using its feet to move underwater) but had a beak filled with <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{frogs and}} toads inflate {{themselves}} to make themselves look large and fierce, and some spadefoot toads (Pelobates spp) scream and leap towards the attacker. Giant salamanders of the genus Andrias, as well as Ceratophrine and Pyxicephalus frogs possess <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth</b> and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite. The blackbelly salamander (Desmognathus quadramaculatus) can bite an attacking common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) {{two or three times}} its size on the head and often manages to escape.|$|E

50|$|Although Abydosaurus lived some 45 {{million years}} after Giraffatitan, the skulls {{of these two}} genera are similar except for the narrower, <b>sharper</b> <b>teeth</b> and smaller nose of Abydosaurus. Abydosaurus can be {{differentiated}} from all other sauropods, including Giraffatitan, by subtle features of the nasal and maxillary bones, its relatively small external nares (nostrils), and some features of the teeth.|$|R
50|$|Clearnose skates have 46 to 54 {{teeth in}} their upper jaw and {{approximately}} the same number in their lower jaw. These teeth are blunt, small, and close together, enabling the skate to crush the hard shells of its prey. Male clearnose skates have <b>sharper</b> <b>teeth</b> than females, although this is probably to aid in copulation rather than feeding.|$|R
5|$|Alioramus were bipedal {{like all}} known theropods, and their <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth</b> {{indicate}} that they were carnivores. Known specimens were smaller than other tyrannosaurids like Tarbosaurus bataar and Tyrannosaurus rex, but their adult size is difficult to estimate since both Alioramus species are known only from juvenile or sub-adult remains. The recent discovery of Qianzhousaurus indicates that it belongs to a distinct branch of tyrannosaur. The genus Alioramus {{is characterized by a}} row of five bony crests {{along the top of the}} snout, a greater number of teeth than any other genus of tyrannosaurid, and a lower skull than other tyrannosaurids.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the nurse}} shark, the tawny nurse shark has a more placid {{disposition}} and will often allow divers to touch and play with it. However, it should be accorded respect due to its powerful jaws and <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth.</b> This species is caught by commercial fisheries across most of its range for meat, fins, liver oil, leather, and fishmeal. It is also esteemed as a game fish off Queensland, Australia, and {{is known for its}} habit of spitting water in the faces of its captors. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the tawny nurse shark as Vulnerable, with subpopulations in several areas already diminished or extirpated.|$|E
5|$|Encounters with tawny nurse sharks {{underwater}} {{indicate a}} more docile demeanor than the similar nurse shark; usually divers {{are able to}} approach the sharks closely and even touch and play with them without incident. However, this species has been infrequently provoked into biting, and merits respect due to its strength, small but <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth,</b> and extremely powerful jaws. Tawny nurse sharks are favored attractions for ecotourist divers off Thailand, the Solomon Islands, and elsewhere. This species also adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquaria in Europe, the United States, Okinawa, and Singapore, where they may become tame enough to be hand-fed.|$|E

5|$|Like most known tyrannosaurids, Gorgosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} weighing {{more than}} two metric tons as an adult; dozens of large, <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth</b> lined its jaws, while its two-fingered forelimbs were comparatively small. Gorgosaurus was most closely related to Albertosaurus, and more distantly related to the larger Tyrannosaurus. Gorgosaurus and Albertosaurus are extremely similar, distinguished mainly by subtle differences in the teeth and skull bones. Some experts consider G. libratus to be a species of Albertosaurus; this would make Gorgosaurus a junior synonym of that genus.|$|E
5|$|The jaws {{contained}} <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth</b> {{which were}} compressed laterally and unequal {{in size and}} shape, and this variation of tooth shape is known as heterodonty. The teeth on the premaxillae (bones at the very tip of the upper jaw) were slender, unlike those of the maxillae (the main tooth-bearing bones in the upper jaw) which had a straight posterior edge. The upper jaw bore 30 teeth, with each premaxilla carrying about 4 teeth and each maxilla 11, while the lower jaw held 22 teeth.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{reportedly}} {{joined the}} cast of Prometheus in February 2011 with Idris Elba and Kate Dickie. Harris described Fifield as an audience surrogate who is very cautious and questions dangerous situations. Jon Spaihts, author of Alien: Engineers (the original prequel), wrote Fifield as changing directly into an Alien from the black mutagen, tying the film into the Alien canon. During its evolution into Prometheus, Ridley Scott decided to diverge from the previous films and establish a separate canon. In a deleted take of Fifield's mutated face he is more deformed and reminiscent of an Alien, with an elongated cranium under the melted, translucent helmet, long arms and <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth.</b> The character's final depiction retained Fifield's human appearance.|$|E

Cumaceans, ophiuroids, and hydrozoans were likely incidentally consumed by mature fe-males. Sexual dimorphism in dentition was observed; mature males had longer and <b>sharper</b> <b>tooth</b> cusps than females or immature males. However, {{there was a}} high degree of dietary overlap between mature males and mature females, indicating that dental sexual dimor-phism in the species is more important in reproductive behaviour than in differential prey consumption...|$|R
50|$|The {{teeth of}} the Port Jackson shark are {{one of its most}} {{distinguishable}} feature. Unlike other sharks, its teeth are different in the front and back. The front <b>teeth</b> are small, <b>sharp</b> and pointed, while the back teeth are flat and blunt. These teeth function to hold and break, then crush and grind the shells of the mollusks and echinoderms upon which this species feeds. Juveniles of the species have <b>sharper</b> <b>teeth</b> and their diet has a higher proportion of soft-bodied prey than adults.|$|R
5000|$|Shark Tooth Mountain, officially {{named in}} 1954, {{is also known}} as The Sharktooth or <b>Sharp</b> <b>Tooth</b> Mountain. It is a {{mountain}} in the East Kootenay region of southeastern British Columbia, Canada, southwest of Whiteswan Lake. [...] Presumably, the name is related to the profile of the peak. It sits to the southwest of Whiteswan Lake Provincial Park, with Lussier Hot Springs and Ram Creek Hot Springs nearby, and is part of the Kootenay Ranges subdivision of the Canadian Rockies in Western Alberta and most of British Columbia.|$|R
5|$|It {{lived in}} what is now {{southern}} Germany in the Late Jurassic period around 150million years ago, when Europe was an archipelago in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the equator than it is now. Similar in shape to a European magpie, with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a raven, Archaeopteryx could grow to about 0.5metres (1.6ft) in length. Despite its small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, Archaeopteryx has more in common with other small Mesozoic dinosaurs than it does with modern birds. In particular, it shares the following features with the deinonychosaurs (dromaeosaurs and troodontids): jaws with <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth,</b> three fingers with claws, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes ("killing claw"), feathers (which suggest homeothermy), and various skeletal features. These features make Archaeopteryx a clear candidate for a transitional fossil between dinosaurs and birds, making it important in the study both of dinosaurs and of the origin of birds.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth</b> and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{is primarily}} a visual hunter; experiments in nature show that they strike at fish-shaped targets without any electrical, chemical, vibrational, or behavioral cues. At night, they are guided by the bioluminescence of planktonic dinoflagellates and ostracods disturbed by moving prey. This species' visual system is attuned to the wavelengths of light emitted by these planktonic organisms, showing the importance of night hunting. Pacific angelsharks {{are more likely to}} strike at prey approaching from the front. It usually waits until the prey approaches to , as its attack is less accurate beyond this distance. The strike is a stereotyped behavior in which the shark presses the forward lobes of its pectoral fins against the bottom and thrusts its head upwards at up to a 90° angle. Its mouth forms a tube when opened, creating a suction force, while its jaws protude forward to secure the prey between <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth.</b> During the strike, the eyes roll backward into the head for protection. The strike is often completed in under a tenth of a second.|$|E
50|$|In Central and South America, the {{alligator}} family {{is represented by}} six species of the subfamily Caimaninae, which differ from {{the alligator}} {{by the absence of}} a bony septum between the nostrils, and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony scutes, each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture. Besides the three species in Caiman, the smooth-fronted caimans in genus Paleosuchus and the black caiman in Melanosuchus are described. Caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile-like in their movements, and have longer, <b>sharper</b> <b>teeth</b> than alligators.|$|R
50|$|Zatrič {{consists}} of the upper town, located at the very top, around which down town was spread. Top Gradište has a shape that resembles a <b>sharp</b> <b>tooth</b> or beak, with southern and eastern sides protected by isolated and sharp rocks that, in some places, reach up to 50 meters. On its north side, {{there is a natural}} plateau, on which research discovered ceramics and brick remains were discovered, contours of four-squared and polygonal facilities, and the basis of towers and ramps, which were connected the lower town to upper town.|$|R
50|$|It {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the related Prunus americana, differing most obviously in the leaf margins having blunt, gland-tipped teeth, rather than the <b>sharp,</b> glandless <b>teeth</b> of P. americana leaves.|$|R
5|$|Tiktaalik {{generally}} had {{the characteristics}} of a lobe-finned fish, but with front fins featuring arm-like skeletal structures more akin to those of a crocodile, including a shoulder, elbow, and wrist. The fossil discovered in 2004 did not include the rear fins and tail. It had rows of <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth</b> indicative of a predator fish, and its neck could move independently of its body, which is not common in other fish (Tarrasius, Mandageria, placoderms, and extant seahorses being some exceptions; see also Lepidogalaxias and Channallabes apus). The animal had a flat skull resembling a crocodile's; eyes on top of its head, suggesting that it {{spent a lot of time}} looking up; a neck and ribs similar to those of tetrapods, with the ribs being used to support its body and aid in breathing via lungs; well developed jaws suitable for catching prey; and a small gill slit called a spiracle that, in more derived animals, became an ear.|$|E
5|$|In general, a Vortigaunt is a {{somewhat}} humanoid figure with two legs and two arms, but has an additional arm protruding from its thorax. Vortigaunts have mottled green skin and digitigrade legs, {{allowing them to}} move quickly. Typically, Vortigaunts have a slightly hunched posture. In addition, Vortigaunts have <b>sharp</b> <b>teeth,</b> clawed hands, strong senses, and their faces are dominated by a large red eye. In Half-Life, this eye is surrounded by five smaller eyes, although, in Half-Life 2, this {{has been reduced to}} three smaller eyes. A key aspect of the Vortigaunts is their ability to summon energy to their command without the need for any equipment. In-game, this ability is most commonly used as a means of attack, with Vortigaunts' hurling the energy towards foes in the form of green electrical bolts. In addition, Vortigaunts {{have been shown to be}} able to use the energy for other purposes, such as assisting in repair work, removing rubble and blockages, recharging the player's HEV suit or powering up electrical generators. Enslaved Vortigaunts are depicted with green collars and shackles, although the means by which these control Vortigaunts is not explored. Vortigaunts are not typically seen wearing clothing, although several Vortigaunts are observed wearing lab coats and chef's clothing in the course of Half-Life 2 and its expansions. Vortigaunts are depicted as meat eaters; the player can observe Vortigaunts' eating human corpses in Half-Life and cooking headcrabs in Half-Life 2, although Half-Life 2 also shows Vortigaunts working in kitchens with chef hats, preparing soups and salads, suggesting that Vortigaunts are omnivores.|$|E
