40|$|AbstractDissimilar metal {{welded joints}} {{are used in}} primary water systems of {{pressurized}} water reactor in nuclear power plant. They are mainly used to connect the ferritic steel pipe-nozzles of the pressure vessels such as reactor pressure vessels, steam generators and pressurizers with the austenitic stainless steel <b>safe</b> <b>end.</b> Thus, maintaining integrity of such joints is critical to ensure their safe service. As local wall thinning may probably appear at <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> to due to erosion and corrosion, assessment methods with local wall thinning are urgently needed. In this paper, three-dimensional finite element analysis models with and without considering local wall thinning were built for dissimilar metal welded joints connected the <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> to pipe-nozzle of the reactor pressure vessel. A detailed analysis {{has been carried out}} to the limit load research of this structure. Results show that the bending load is the main factor influencing the stress distribution change and limit load. According to finite element results, the depth of local wall thinning should be the most important factor influencing limit load solution, while circumferential local wall thinning shows very small variation. Based on the finite element results prediction equations of limit loads for <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> with local wall thinning have been proposed...|$|E

From 1998 to 2010, ten outbreaks implicated undercooked not-ready-to-eat entrées. In each outbreak, affected individuals prepared entrées in a microwave oven, did not follow recommended cooking instructions, and failed to take the internal temperature of the cooked product. This dissertation surveyed grocery stores for product availability, evaluated consumers’ preparation practices of raw, breaded, frozen chicken entrées, and validated on-package label instructions. The survey of retail revealed that several manufacturers fail to provide consumers clear preparation instructions. A video capture system was used to observe food preparation practices of 41 consumers– 21 primary meal preparers and 20 adolescents–in a mock domestic kitchen using uncooked, frozen, breaded chicken products, and determined if differences exist between consumers’ reported safe food handling practices and actual food handling behavior as prescribed on product labels. Differences between self-report and observed food safety behaviors were identified between groups. Many participants reported owning a food thermometer (73 percent) and reported using one when cooking raw, breaded chicken entrées (19. 5 percent); however, only five participants (12. 2 percent) were observed measuring the final internal temperature with a food thermometer despite instructions on the product packaging to do so. Food handling errors identified during the meal preparation sessions were then mimicked in a controlled laboratory setting to determine the impact of such deviations on end-product temperature. For all products, highly variable internal temperatures were recorded across entrées when prepared in a 600 W microwave oven. Microwave cooking of raw breaded poultry products is unpredictable in achieving uniform target end-point temperatures; however, a 1000 W microwave oven consistently produced a <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> product. Data collected through direct observation more accurately reflected consumer food handling behaviors than data collected through self-reported surveys. Low wattage microwave ovens failed to produce a <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> product. Processors should validate instructions for not-ready-eat entrées using a range of microwave ovens rather than a single wattage, develop a unique set of instructions for entrées, and provide consumers clear cooking instructions that result in a <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> product...|$|E

It was found that the Ke analysis data reflecting elastic follow-up can be consolidated by normalizing the primary-plus-secondary stress intensity ranges excluding the nonlinear thermal stress intensity component, Sn to over-match degree of yield strength, MF. For the effect of over-match on Kn × Κν, dispersion of the Kn × Κν analysis data can be sharply reduced by dividing total stress intensity range, excluding local thermal stresses, Sp-lt by MF. Finally, the proposed equations were applied to the weld between the <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> and the piping of a pressurizer surge nozzle in pressurized water reactors in order to calculate a cumulative usage factor. The cumulative usage factor was then compared with those derived by the previous Ke factor equations.

40|$|One of {{the lasting}} {{contributions}} of Fishman’s (1991) seminal book, Reversing Language Shift, is GIDS — the Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale. He developed GIDS as a measuring rod for {{the level of}} threat to long-term language maintenance. The scale has eight levels (numbered 1 to 8) representing increasing levels of threat or disruption. At level 1, representing virtually no threat, is an official national language with a standardized written form that {{is used for the}} business of government and passed to the next generation through a national system of compulsory education. At level 8, representing virtually assured language death, is a language spoken only by the elderly. The six levels in between represent successively fewer functions for language in society as the level of disruption increases. The basic premise of GIDS is that language shift happens as languages lose functions in society. To reverse language shift, the community must engage in language development activities to bring those functions back and to even add new functions that further strengthen the position of the language (like writing and use in formal education). GIDS is well elaborated on the <b>safe</b> <b>end,</b> but has only two levels on the endangered end. By contrast, the scale developed by the UNESCO Expert Meeting on Safeguarding Endangered Languages (Brenzinger and others 2003) identifies four levels of endangerment, but does not distinguish different levels on the <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> of the scale. We have developed an Extended GIDS (Authors 2010) by harmonizing GIDS, the UNESCO scale, and categories used in Ethnologue (Lewis 2009). The EGIDS is a 13 -level scale which recognizes the following levels (from highest to lowest) : International, National, Provincial, Wider Communication, Educational, Developing, Vigorous, Threatened, Shifting, Moribund, Nearly Extinct, Dormant, Extinct. The paper will present the results of our efforts to assign an EGIDS level to every known language enumerated in the ISO 639 - 3 standard (ISO 2007). Since EGIDS differentiates levels of development as well as levels of endangerment, we can report not only on the extent of language endangerment worldwide, but also on the extent of language development. For instance, we find that of 7, 065 known living languages, 12 % are dying (8 a and lower) and 21 % are in trouble (6 b and 7). By contrast, 10 % have attained the relative safety of institutionalization (4 and higher) and 19 % are vigorous with development taking place (5).

40|$|Critics have {{described}} psychology {{as a science}} impaired by disunity. The most recent special issue of Review of General Psychology sought to specifically address this concern, seeking perspectives {{from a wide range}} of theorists, each of whom offered their tradition's approach to how psychology as a whole may be integrated into a more unified whole. To continue this discussion, this article draws upon examples from the special issue, the disunity crisis literature, and wider writings in the philosophy of science, to explore the theoretical and conceptual divisions that foster ambiguity, confusion, and apparent irreconcilable differences between the disparate fields of psychology. The authors conclude that the majority of contemporary, scientific psychology is oriented toward a shared physical ontology, which can serve as a common grounding point from which the conceptual and theoretical differences of disparate fields may be meaningfully framed and evaluated. To this end, this article proposes that the various research traditions of psychology can be understood through their positions along a continuum of practical assumptions, which embodies the inherent conflict between two scientific priorities: metaphysical certainty (the <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> of the continuum) and practical experimental predictions (the risky end of the continuum). Three theoretical perspectives offered in the unification special issue are examined under this framework: situational realism (a distinctly safe approach), developmental evolutionary psychology (an intermediate approach), and the Tree of Knowledge unified theory (a relatively risky approach).

Vermicomposting was tested for destruction of the model pathogens, helminthic parasites, in an experiment with highly concentrated and viable Ascaris suum (2626 ± 1306 ova/g, 61. 6 ± 8. 7 % viable) inoculated into fecal matter and coir (30 : 70 ratio) with and without Eisenia fetida worms.

40|$|The {{potential}} of granular sludge from upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors for bioremediation of chlorinated pollutants was evaluated by using carbon tetrachloride (CT) {{as a model}} compound. Granular sludges cultivated in UASB reactors on methanol, a volatile fatty acid mixture, or sucrose readily degraded CT supplied at a concentration of 1, 500 nmol/batch (approximately 10 μM) without any prior exposure to organohalogens. The maximum degradation rate was 1. 9 μmol of CT g of volatile suspended solids− 1 day− 1. The main end products of CT degradation were CO 2 and Cl−, and the yields of these end products were 44 and 68 %, respectively, of the initial amounts of [14 C]CT and CT-Cl. Lower chlorinated methanes accumulated in minor amounts temporarily. Autoclaved (dead) sludges were capable of degrading CT at rates two- to threefold lower than those for living sludges, indicating that abiotic processes (mediated by cofactors or other sludge components) {{played an important role}} in the degradation observed. Reduced components in the autoclaved sludge were vital for CT degradation. A major part (51 %) of the CT was converted abiotically to CS 2. The amount of CO 2 produced (23 %) was lower and the amount of Cl− produced (86 %) was slightly higher with autoclaved sludge than with living sludge. Both living and autoclaved sludges could degrade chloroform. However, only living sludge degraded dichloromethane and methylchloride. These results indicate that reductive dehalogenation, which was mediated better by living sludge than by autoclaved sludge, is only a minor pathway for CT degradation. The main pathway involves substitutive and oxidative dechlorination reactions that lead to the formation of CO 2. Granular sludge, therefore, has outstanding potential for gratuitous dechlorination of CT to <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> products...|$|E
40|$|The {{contamination}} of raw ground beef by Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 {{is not only}} a public health issue but also an economic concern to meat processors. When E. coli O 157 :H 7 is detected in a ground beef sample, the product lots made immediately before and after the lot represented by the positive sample are discarded or diverted to lethality treatment. However, there is little data to base decisions on how much product must be diverted. Therefore, five 2, 000 -lb (907 -kg) combo bins of beef trimmings were processed into 10 -lb (4. 54 -kg) chubs of raw ground beef, wherein the second combo of meat was contaminated with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) –expressing strain of E. coli. This was performed at two different commercial ground beef processing facilities, and at a third establishment where ground beef chubs from the second grinding establishment were mechanically split and repackaged into 3 -lb (1. 36 -kg) loaves in trays. The GFP E. coli was tracked through the production of 10 -lb (4. 54 -kg) chubs and the strain could not be detected after 26. 5 % more material (500 lb or 227 kg) and 87. 8 % more material (1, 840 lb or 835 kg) followed the contaminated combo at each establishment, respectively. Three-pound (1. 36 -kg) loaves were no longer positive after just 8. 6 % more initially noncontaminated material (72 lb or 33 kg) was processed.

These {{results indicate that the}} fish associated the illness with the more 2 ̆ 2 novel 2 ̆ 2 food even though their familiar diet was temporally closer to the illness. In Experiment III five species of naive fish were habituated to 20 -gallon tanks and made ill after eating in one end and not in the other. The same food was us ed in both ends. The 2 ̆ 2 illness end 2 ̆ 2 could have taken on discriminitive properties and food consumption there should have decreased, as opposed to the other 2 ̆ 2 <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> 2 ̆ 2. The results indicated that 2 ̆ 2 place 2 ̆ 2 did not acquire aversive discriminitive properties. Food consumption decreased in quantity, food approach latencies increased and length of tasting bouts increased in both ends. These {{experiments were}} the first to use these species of fish in this type of research. The results extend the phenomena of taste aversion and food neophobia. In addition, Experiment III systematically replicated the hypothesis of relevant relations between stimuli and showed that it is easier to learn certain consequences with certain cues than with others. In this case illness was quickly associated with taste but 2 ̆ 2 place 2 ̆ 2 was treated as irrelevant...|$|E
