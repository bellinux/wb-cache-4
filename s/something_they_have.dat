25|$|Although Dallas {{has made}} several tweaks to their blue jerseys over the years, Schramm {{said he did}} not believe in the curse. Since the league began {{allowing}} teams to use an alternate jersey, the Cowboys' alternates have been primarily blue versions of past jerseys and the Cowboys have generally had success when wearing these blue alternates. With the implementation of the 2013 NFL helmet rule for alternate jerseys, the team decided instead to wear their regular blue jerseys for their Thanksgiving game, <b>something</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not done at home since Schramm started the white-jersey-at-home tradition.|$|E

2500|$|From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was a {{professor}} of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University, and a prominent critic of and expert on Beowulf [...] on which he gave a lecture at the British Academy in 1936 and which he described {{as one of his}} [...] "most valued sources" [...] for The Hobbit. Many of Smaug's attributes and behaviour in The Hobbit derive directly from the unnamed [...] "old night-scather" [...] in Beowulf: great age; winged, fiery, and reptilian form; a stolen barrow within which he lies on his hoard; disturbance by a theft; and violent airborne revenge on the lands all about. Smaug was intimately familiar with every last item within his hoard, and instantly noticed the theft of a relatively inconsequential cup by Bilbo Baggins. Tolkien writes that Smaug's rage was the kind which [...] "is only seen when rich folk that have more than they can enjoy lose <b>something</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> long had but never before used or wanted." [...] This theft of a cup, Smaug's knowledge of every item in the hoard, and the dragon's ensuing rampage, all echo the story of Beowulf.|$|E

60|$|He {{went out}} the door and across the field, empty handed. There were a lot of them {{standing}} around, gathered together, waiting. They expected a good fight; <b>they</b> knew he <b>had</b> <b>something.</b> <b>They</b> <b>had</b> heard about the incident at the fountain.|$|R

6000|$|In May, 1794, William Wordsworth was at Whitehaven, at his uncle's, Mr. Richard Wordsworth's; and he then {{proposes to}} his friend Mathews, who was {{resident}} in London, that they should set on foot a monthly political and literary Miscellany, to which, he says, 'he would communicate critical remarks on poetry, the arts of painting, gardening, &c., besides essays on morals and politics.' 'I am at present,' he adds, 'nearly at leisure--I say nearly, for I am not quite so, as I am correcting, and considerably adding to, those poems which I published in your absence' ('The Evening Walk' and 'Descriptive Sketches'). 'It was with great reluctance that I sent those two little works into the world in so imperfect a state. But as I had done nothing by which to distinguish myself at the university, I thought these little things might show that I could do <b>something.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> been treated with unmerited contempt {{by some of the}} periodicals, and others have spoken in higher terms of them than they deserve.'[33] ...|$|E

50|$|Having {{experience}} and developing skill {{with this type}} of learning often facilitates informal and base learning.
