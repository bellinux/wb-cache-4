40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} the multiple-access relay chan-nel {{in a setting}} where two <b>source</b> <b>nodes</b> transmit packets to a destination node, both directly and via a relay node, over packet erasure channels. Intra-session network coding is used at the <b>source</b> <b>nodes</b> and inter-session network coding is employed at the relay node to combine the recovered source packets of both <b>source</b> <b>nodes.</b> In this work, we investigate {{the performance of the}} network-coded system in terms of the probability that the destination node will successfully recover the source packets of the two <b>source</b> <b>nodes.</b> We build our analysis on fundamental probability expressions for random matrices over finite fields and we derive upper bounds on the system performance for the case of systematic and non-systematic network coding. Simulation results show that the upper bounds are very tight and accurately predict the decoding probability at the destination node. Our analysis also exposes the clear benefits of systematic network coding at the <b>source</b> <b>nodes</b> compared to non-systematic transmission.

40|$|Abstract—For {{wireless}} fading networks where M <b>source</b> <b>nodes</b> wish to multicast {{their information}} to N destination nodes via a common relay, {{it has been}} shown that network coding at the relay can reduce the number of required transmissions, if the destination nodes overhear M − 1 <b>source</b> <b>nodes</b> transmitting to the relay. Nested coding is a recently proposed alternative where, unlike network coding, physical and network layers are jointly designed. We find that for a given network throughput ideal nested coding in many situations can lead to a significant increase in transmission reliability compared to network coding. We also consider the case of feedback and retransmissions when received packets fail to be decoded. For the case of two <b>source</b> <b>nodes</b> it is shown that by using nested codes the expected number of relay transmissions is reduced.
