Students typically score 20 percent on their first examination, and increase by five to seven percent with each successive examination. Students can monitor the changes in their scores and receive formative feedback based on a standardized score relative to the class mean. Due to the overwhelming success and research supporting {{the use of the}} PPI as an evaluation tool, it is now used in Canada, US, Europe, and Australia.|$|E
