5|$|Sugarloaf was {{the usual}} cone-form in which refined sugar was {{produced}} and sold until the late 19th century. This <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> still in use in Germany (for preparation of Feuerzangenbowle), in Iran and Morocco.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The circle in the middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> a triangle. If the <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shapes</b> can <b>be</b> {{linked with}} {{external}} data sources. Doing so, the <b>shapes</b> <b>are</b> formatted {{according to the}} data.

40|$|Input <b>shaping</b> <b>is</b> {{a method}} for {{controlling}} residual vibration in linear systems. Because input <b>shaping</b> can <b>be</b> made robust to errors in the estimation of the system’s frequencies, it has possible applications on some types of nonlinear systems. The effectiveness of input <b>shaping</b> <b>is</b> investigated on a nonlinear model of a flexible, two-link robotic arm. Results indicate that <b>shaping</b> <b>is</b> very effective when the system has small frequency variations. When the system experiences large frequency changes, shaping still provides significant vibration reduction...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of traffic <b>shaping</b> <b>is</b> application-based traffic <b>shaping.</b> In application-based traffic <b>shaping,</b> {{fingerprinting}} tools <b>are</b> first used to identify applications of interest, which are then subject to shaping policies. Some controversial cases of application-based traffic shaping include bandwidth throttling of peer-to-peer file sharing traffic. Many application protocols use encryption to circumvent application-based traffic shaping. Another type of traffic <b>shaping</b> <b>is</b> route-based traffic <b>shaping.</b> Route-based traffic <b>shaping</b> <b>is</b> conducted based on previous-hop or next-hop information.|$|R
5|$|Although {{there exist}} {{polynomial}} time algorithms {{to find a}} matrix having given row and column sums, the solution may be far from unique: any submatrix {{in the form of}} a 22 identity matrix can be complemented without affecting the correctness of the solution. Therefore, researchers have searched for constraints on the shape to be reconstructed that can be used to restrict the space of solutions. For instance, one might assume that the <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> connected; however, testing whether there exists a connected solution is NP-complete. An even more constrained version that is easier to solve is that the <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> orthogonally convex: having a single contiguous block of squares in each row and column.|$|E
5|$|Lunar swirls are enigmatic {{features}} found {{across the}} Moon's surface, which {{are characterized by}} a high albedo, appearing optically immature (i.e. the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith), and often displaying a sinuous shape. Their curvilinear <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls.|$|E
5|$|Metis is tidally locked to Jupiter, and its <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> {{strongly}} asymmetrical, {{with one}} of the diameters being almost twice as large as the smallest one. It {{is also one of the}} two moons known to orbit Jupiter in less than the length of Jupiter's day, the other being Adrastea. It orbits within the main ring of Jupiter, and is thought to be a major contributor of material to the rings.|$|E

40|$|Scattering {{patterns}} from geometrical {{bodies with}} different shapes and anisometry (solid and hollow spheres, cylinders, prisms) are computed and the <b>shapes</b> <b>are</b> reconstructed ab initio using envelope function and bead modelling methods. A procedure is described to analyze multiple solutions provided by bead modeling methods and to estimate stability {{and reliability of}} the <b>shape</b> reconstruction. It <b>is</b> demonstrated that flat <b>shapes</b> <b>are</b> more difficult to restore than elongated ones and types of <b>shapes</b> <b>are</b> indicated, which require additional information for reliable shape reconsrtuction from the scattering data...|$|R
5|$|NGC 4027 {{is another}} member of the NGC 4038 group, notable for its {{extended}} spiral arm. Known as the Ringtail Galaxy, it lies close to 31 Crateris. A barred spiral galaxy, its distorted <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> probably due to a past collision, possibly with the nearby NGC 4027A. NGC 4782 and NGC 4783 are a pair of merging elliptical galaxies in the northeastern part of the constellation, around 200 million light-years distant.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian bow is {{a fairly}} long, {{approximately}} symmetrical, composite reflex bow with bone stiffeners. Its <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> known from two graves in which {{the position of the}} bone plates could be reconstructed. Modern Hungarians have attempted to reconstruct the composite bows of their ancestors and have revived mounted archery as a competitive sport.|$|E
5|$|The basidia are 15–25×3.5–5.5µm {{and have}} a slim, club-like shape. Each {{basidium}} features four sterigmata, each of which bear one spore. The spores' <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> slimly ellipsoidal or cylindrical. Their surface is smooth and their walls are thin. Although they are colourless and hyaline, the spores are amyloid, meaning they will turn bluish or purple when stained with Melzer's reagent. This characteristic differs from other very similar species, and this gave the genus its name.|$|E
5|$|The <b>shape</b> <b>was</b> first {{isolated}} in crystal form in 2014 as Reuleaux triangle disks. Basic bismuth nitrate disks with the Reuleaux triangle <b>shape</b> <b>were</b> formed from the hydrolysis and precipitation of bismuth nitrate in an ethanol–water {{system in the}} presence of 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine.|$|R
50|$|Day <b>shapes</b> <b>are</b> {{black in}} color and their sizes are {{determined}} by the ColRegs, for instance the size of the ball is not less than 0.6 meter diameter. The vertical distance between <b>shapes</b> <b>is</b> at least 1.5 meters. Vessels of less than 20 meters length may use shapes of smaller size commensurate with the size of the vessel. Day shapes of standard and reduced sizes are both commercially available. Day <b>shapes</b> <b>are</b> commonly constructed from a light weight frame covered with fabric and are designed to be collapsible for ease of storage.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} conform mobile base station antenna simply {{for the next}} {{generation}} mobile system (5 G), a cylindrical lens antenna is developing. For the lens material, negative refractive index is used so as to reduce lens thickness. In this paper, relations of lens parameters and lens <b>shapes</b> <b>are</b> investigated. Design parameters for achieving practical thin lens <b>shapes</b> <b>are</b> clarified. Moreover, lens <b>shaping</b> accuracies <b>are</b> investigated through checking the refractive angles or ray paths on lens surfaces. All refractive angle results agree very well with the theoretical value. Adequateness of lens <b>shaping</b> results <b>is</b> ensured...|$|R
5|$|The floral tube {{is formed}} by fusion of the basal {{segments}} of the tepals (proximally connate). Its <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> from an inverted cone (obconic) to funnel-shaped (funneliform) or cylindrical, and is surmounted by the more distal corona. Floral tubes can range from long and narrow in sections Apodanthi and Jonquilla to rudimentary (N. cavanillesii).|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} (shape) {{of volcanic}} ash {{is controlled by}} a plethora of different eruption and kinematic processes. Eruptions of low-viscosity magmas (e.g., basalt) typically form droplet shaped particles. This droplet <b>shape</b> <b>is,</b> in part, controlled by surface tension, acceleration of the droplets after they leave the vent, and air friction. Shapes range from perfect spheres {{to a variety of}} twisted, elongate droplets with smooth, fluidal surfaces.|$|E
5|$|This {{order of}} starfish {{consists}} mostly of deep-sea and other cold-water starfish {{often with a}} global distribution. The <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> pentagonal or star-shaped with five to fifteen arms. They mostly have poorly developed skeletons with papulae widely distributed on the aboral surface and often spiny pedicellariae. This group includes the slime star.|$|E
40|$|Dendritic <b>shapes</b> <b>are</b> {{commonplace in}} the natural world such as trees, lichens, coral and lightning. Models of {{dendritic}} <b>shapes</b> <b>are</b> widely needed in many areas. Because of their branching fractal and erratic structures modeling dendritic <b>shapes</b> <b>is</b> a tricky task. Existing methods for modeling dendritic <b>shapes</b> <b>are</b> slow and complicated. In this thesis we present a procedural algorithm of using path planning to model dendritic shapes. We generate a dendrite by finding the least-cost paths from multiple endpoints to a common generator and use the dendrite to build the geometric model. With the control handles of endpoint placement, fractal shape, edge weights distribution and path width, we create different shapes of dendrites that simulate different kinds of dendritic shapes very well. Compared with some existing methods, our algorithm is fast and simple...|$|R

5|$|A {{description}} of the species was published by Jacques Labillardière in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, accompanied by a figure drawn by Pierre Antoine Poiteau and engraved by Auguste Plée. Labillardière chose the specific name obovata, {{in reference to the}} leaves of his specimen, which were obovate (egg-shaped, with the narrow end at the base). This leaf <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> often seen in this species. The term obovata derives from the Latin ob- ("inverse") and ovum ("egg"), and has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus.|$|E
5|$|Active {{elliptical}} galaxies of a form {{similar to}} M87 {{are believed to}} form {{as a result of}} one or more mergers between smaller galaxies. There is now little dust remaining to form the diffuse nebulae where new stars were created, so the stellar population is dominated by old, population II stars that contain relatively low abundances of elements other than hydrogen and helium. M87's elliptical <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> maintained by random orbital motions of its member stars, in contrast to the more orderly rotational motions found in a spiral galaxy such as the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> known as a convex meniscus.|$|E
50|$|Sender side pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>is</b> often {{combined}} with a receiver side matched filter to achieve optimum tolerance for noise in the system. In this case the pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>is</b> equally distributed between the sender and receiver filters. The filters' amplitude responses are thus pointwise square roots of the system filters.|$|R

The medical procedure via which ears are reshaped to give a normal appearance is known as otoplasty. Ear <b>shaping</b> <b>is</b> usually performed by body modification artists.|$|R
40|$|Anomalous optogalvanic line <b>shapes</b> <b>were</b> {{observed}} in a commercial hollow cathode lamp containing argon buffer gas. Deviations from Gaussian line <b>shapes</b> <b>were</b> particularly strong for transitions originating from the 3 P 2 metastable level of argon. The anomalous line <b>shapes</b> can <b>be</b> described reasonably well by the assumption that two regions in the discharge are excited simultaneously, each giving rise to a purely Gaussian line shape, but with different polarities, amplitudes, and linewidths...|$|R
5|$|Bottle trees grow best in well-drained, {{slightly}} acidic soil, in full sunshine. They are {{suited to}} cultivation in regional climates equivalent to USDA hardiness zones 9 to 12. In the first stages of growth, the bottle tree is very slow-growing, {{and the formation}} of the unique bottle <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> not visible until the tree is about 5 to 8 years old. Mature trees transplant easily, and can withstand intervals of up to three months between digging and replanting without detriment. Bottle trees grown from seed may take up to 20 years to flower. Flowering takes place after adult leaves have appeared.|$|E
5|$|In a real vector space, a {{non-empty}} setQ {{is defined}} to be convex if, for {{each pair of}} its points, every point on the line segment that joins them is a subset ofQ. For example, a solid disk is convex but a circle is not, {{because it does not}} contain a line segment joining its points; the non-convex set of three integers{0,1,2} is contained in the interval, which is convex. For example, a solid cube is convex; however, anything that is hollow or dented, for example, a crescent <b>shape,</b> <b>is</b> non-convex. The emptyset is convex, either by definition or vacuously, depending on the author.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{produces}} basidiospores {{that are}} ellipsoidal or broadly ellipsoidal in shape. The spore <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} features that makes the species readily recognisable microscopically, and the spores measure from 4.5 to 6.1 by 3.5 to 5 micrometres(μm). The average spore length is 5.25μm, while the average width is 4.14μm. The spores have thick cell walls, and are hyaline. They are strongly cyanophilous, meaning that the cell walls will readily absorb methyl blue stain. In addition, they are weakly dextrinoid, meaning that they will stain slightly reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on barrel-shaped basidia, with four spores per basidium, measuring 8 to 12 by 6 to 7μm. There are also basidioles, which are similar in shape to the basidia, but slightly smaller.|$|E
