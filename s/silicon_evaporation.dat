40|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} the redistribution of boron in silicon by both diffusion and autodoping during epitaxial growth, certain materials parameters must {{be known as a}} function of temperature. The parameters are the diffusion coeffi-cient of boron, the evaporation coefficient of boron from silicon, and the <b>silicon</b> <b>evaporation</b> rate in a hydrogen ambient. The value of the diffusion coefficient of boron is already well known while the values for the other two parameters have not been determined over the temperature range usually used for epi-taxial growth. The evaporation coefficient of boron in silicon in a hydro-gen ambient was experimental ly determined to be h = 1. 674 • 10 T e- 2. 4 s/kT where h is in microns per minute, the energy is expressed in electron volts, and temperature is in degrees Kelvin. The evaporation rate of silicon in a hydrogen ambient was measured as 0. 013 _ _ 0. 003 microns/min in a hydrogen ambient.

40|$|Metal oxide {{thin films}} grown on metal single {{crystals}} {{are commonly used}} to model heterogeneous catalyst supports. The structure and properties of thin silicon dioxide films grown on metal single crystals have only recently been thoroughly characterized and their spectral properties well established. We report the successful growth of a three- dimensional, vitreous silicon dioxide thin film on the Pt(111) surface and reproduce the closed bilayer structure previously reported. The confirmation of the three dimensional nature {{of the film is}} unequivocally shown by the infrared absorption band at 1252 cm− 1. Temperature programmed desorption was used to show that this three-dimensional thin film covers the Pt(111) surface {{to such an extent that}} its application as a catalyst support for clusters/nanoparticles is possible. The growth of a three-dimensional film was seen to be directly correlated with the amount of oxygen present on the surface after the <b>silicon</b> <b>evaporation</b> process. This excess of oxygen is tentatively attributed to atomic oxygen being generated in the evaporator. The identification of atomic oxygen as a necessary building block for the formation of a three-dimensional thin film opens up new possibilities for thin film growth on metal supports, whereby simply changing the type of oxygen enables thin films with different atomic structures to be synthesized. This is a novel approach to tune the synthesis parameters of thin films to grow a specific structure and expands the options for modeling common amorphous silica supports under ultra high vacuum conditions...|$|E

30|$|The {{literature}} {{presents a}} wide experimental material {{on a different}} reconstruction of the Si(001) surface--c(4 × 4)--which also arise at the temperatures of ≳ 600 °C. For example, a review of articles describing different experimental investigations {{can be found in}} refs. [12, 31 – 35]. Based on the generalized data, an inference can be made that the c(4 × 4) structure forms in the interval from 600 to 700 °C. Most likely, at these temperatures, an appreciable migration of Si ad-atoms starts on surface. The structure is free of impurities. It irreversibly transits to the (2 × 1) one at the temperature greater than 720 °C. Aruga and Murata [47] demonstrate formation of the Si(001)-(2 × 8) structure, also without impurity atoms. In analogy with the above literature data, formation of the c(8 × 8) reconstruction may be expected as a result of low-temperature annealing and/or further quenching. The standard annealing temperature for obtaining (2 × 1) structure is known to be in the interval from 1200 to 1250 °C. At these temperatures in UHV ambient, not only oxide film removal from the surface takes place, but also <b>silicon</b> <b>evaporation</b> and carbon desorption go on. Unfortunately, we have not got a technical opportunity to carry out such a high-temperature annealing in our instrument. Treatment at 925 °C that we apply likely does not result in substantial evaporation of Si atoms from the surface, and C atoms, if any, may diffuse into subsurface layers. As a result, a great amount of ad-dimers arise on the surface, like it happens in the process described in ref. [46]. Formation processes of the (2 × 1) and c(8 × 8) structures are different. The (2 × 1) reconstruction arises during the high-temperature annealing, and ad-atoms of the uppermost layer do not need to migrate and be embedded into the lattice to form this reconstruction. On the contrary, c(8 × 8) appears during sample cooling, at rather low temperatures, and at the moment of a prior annealing the uppermost layer consists of abundant ad-atoms. On cooling, the ad-dimers have to migrate along the surface and be built in the lattice. A number of competing sinks may exist on the surface (steps, vacancies, etc.), but high cooling rate may impede ad-atom annihilation slowing their migration to sinks and in such way creating supersaturation and favoring 2 D islanding, and freezing a high-order reconstruction.|$|E
40|$|To {{address the}} problem of {{increasing}} RC delay with interconnect downscaling, porous low-k materials are introduced as a replacement for the traditional SiO 2 dielectric. The carbon-rich chemistry and porous structure of these materials bring in new challenges in integrating them into Back-End-of-Line (BEOL) fabrication. One of the biggest challenges is metal, moisture and barrier precursor diffusion into the pores, which increases the k value. In this PhD work, the possibility of sealing porous low-k materials with Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) is explored. The SAMs pore sealing strategy consists of three steps: i) pretreatment of the low-k surface in order to introduce silanol groups indispensable for SAM attachment; ii) deposition of SAM to seal the low-k surface against the subsequent barrier precursor; iii) formation of a thin metal barrier to avoid the penetration of moisture and copper ions. The focus of this work is to compare different pretreatments for low-k surface activation, with a purpose to enable SAM deposition. Various types of pretreatments are studied and explored. For each individual pretreatment, a SAM deposition followed by a metal barrier deposition is performed to test the effectiveness of pretreatments. In {{the first part of this}} work, the relationship between hydrophilic layer thickness, pore size, and SAMs distribution is studied. Understanding is gained that surface-confined pretreatment is crucially important for the pore sealing with SAMs. The target of successful pretreatments is maximizing the surface silanol group density while minimizing the thickness of the damage layer. Three wet treatments are studied and this method can not introduce sufficient silanol groups on the surface. Another method is to evaporate a thin silicon film on top of low-k then oxidize it to silicon dioxide as add-on hydrophilic layer. This process, however, can not be accurately controlled and might be problematic when combined with patterned structures. An integration based method is also tested. In this method, the low-k pores are stuffed with a polymer-based protector during fluorocarbon plasma patterning, afterwards, the polymers are removed by thermal annealing. It is found that the polymers stuffing approach can reduce low-k damage but is less efficient in mitigating damage from vacuum ultraviolet (VUV). Pretreatments by different plasmas are studied and CO 2 plasma is the preferred pretreatment because the CO 2 ions have high oxidizing potential and get easily discharged, therefore it can create silanol groups on the surface without damaging the deeper layer of low-k film.

30|$|Graphene is a {{sheet of}} {{graphite}} consisting of sp 2 -bonded carbon atoms [1]. The unique material properties of graphene such as extremely high-carrier mobility, semi-metallic characteristics, and two-dimensional [2 -D] very thin sheet of carbon have attracted a great interest and {{will lead to the}} development of nanoelectronics [2, 3]. The graphene was first obtained by cleaving the graphite, but this drawing/exfoliation method is only useful for the demonstration of scientific or engineering concept rather than a large volume manufacturing [1, 4]. The result of exfoliation is not predictable, and the available size is too small (< 100 um) for practical application. In order to obtain a large area graphene, the chemical vapor deposition [CVD] growth on catalytic metals or thermal decomposition of SiC has been extensively studied [5 – 8]. Large area good quality graphene was produced using the CVD method, but the grown graphene has to be transferred to an insulating substrate since the graphene cannot be used on the metals in most applications [9]. This transfer method needs costly processes and likely causes damages to the grown graphene. Thermal decomposition of SiC produces the so-called epitaxial graphene and has shown high crystal quality [10, 11]. Since this epitaxial graphene can be directly formed on an insulating large area substrate compatible with the already established semiconductor processing technique, it is a promising route for commercialization of graphene devices. The epitaxial graphene is grown as a result of Si evaporation at high temperature and can be grown under the ultra high vacuum [UHV] or atmospheric Argon [Ar] environment. The growth under Ar requires higher-annealing temperatures (1, 500 °C to approximately 2, 000 °C) for Si to be evaporated overcoming the Ar pressure near the substrate surface [12]. This method reduces the Si evaporation rate and enhances the surface diffusion resulting in the formation of higher quality graphene. However, this technique needs extremely high temperature and may not be compatible with some samples such as SiC epi on Si substrate. The epitaxial graphene can be formed at relatively lower temperature (1, 150 °C to approximately 1, 450 °C) in the case of UHV, but the film quality is usually lower than that grown under the Ar at higher temperature (1, 500 °C to approximately 2, 000 °C) due to the fast and uncontrollable Si loss. Here, we explore the UHV growth of epitaxial graphene using a face-down configuration. In order to investigate the effects of <b>silicon</b> <b>evaporation</b> rate on the film quality, we designed a growth configuration that would allow the minimization of silicon loss {{and at the same time}} provide a way to examine the effects of a much higher rate of Si evaporation. Both the Si-face and C-face of SiC were chemically and mechanically polished [CMP], and the growth was done on both surfaces with the thermal gradient directed towards one surface and away from the other. This arrangement provides a condition for low and high silicon loss at the same time.|$|E

40|$|The MAX phases {{constitute}} {{a group of}} ternary ceramics which has received intense attention {{over the last decade}} due to their unique combination of properties. The Ti 3 SiC 2 is the most well studied MAX phase to date and it {{has turned out to be}} a promising candidate for high temperature applications. It is oxidation resistant, refractory and not susceptible to thermal shock, while at the same time it can be machined with conventional tools which is of great technological importance. Most attempts to synthesize bulk Ti 3 SiC 2 have involved pure titanium in the starting powder mixtures, but Ti powder is oxidising and requires an inert atmosphere throughout the synthesis process which makes the procedures unsuitable for large scale production. The aim of the first part of this study was to delineate the influence of sintering time and temperature on the formation of Ti 3 SiC 2 from a starting powder which does not contain pure titanium. Titanium silicon carbide MAX phase was synthesised from ball milled TiC/Si powders, sintered under vacuum for different times and temperatures. After heat treatment the samples were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). This study showed that TiC was always present in the final products whereas TiSi 2 was an intermediate phase to the Ti 3 SiC 2 formation. The highest amount of Ti 3 SiC 2 was achieved for short holding times of 2 - 4 hours, at high temperatures, 1350 - 1400 ¢ªC. More elevated temperatures or extended times resulted in silicon loss and decomposition of Ti 3 SiC 2. In the second part of this study the sintering reactions and the mechanisms of formation of Ti 3 SiC 2 were investigated by x-ray diffractometry, thermodilatometry, thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry and mass spectrometry. TiC/Si powders of the different ratios; 3 : 2 and 3 : 2. 2, were heated to different temperatures under flowing argon gas in a dilatometer and examined by XRD. The TiC/Si powder samples of the ratio 3 : 2 were further investigated by the other thermal analysis methods. The results confirmed the presence of the intermediate phase TiSi 2. From 1500 ¢ªC <b>silicon</b> <b>evaporation</b> and MAX phase decomposition were observed, and the results show that the MAX phase formation may be concurrent with the melting of silicon. TiC was always present in the final products, either as a reactant or as a decomposition product. The extra silicon of the 3 : 2. 2 TiC/Si powder significantly increased the Ti 3 SiC 2 conversion and no intermediate phases were observed for this powder mixture. The Si of these samples did not melt or evaporate, and only minor decomposition was observed even at 1700 ¢ªC.

40|$|This study explores a new {{route for}} the {{synthesis}} of SiC Ultra Fine Powder (UFP) directly from solid silicon particles and methane, using thermal plasma technology. Both d. c. plasma and r. f. induction plasma have been employed to realize the SiC synthesis. The steps involved are the vaporization of the Si powder, followed by the vapor phase carburization and condensation of SiC UFP. On {{the basis of the}} experimental results of this reaction, in-situ boron doped SiC UFP was subsequently synthesized using the r. f. induction plasma process. The sintering properties of the various plasma-synthesized SiC UFP's were evaluated and compared to the behaviour of commercial powders. In performing the d. c. plasma synthesis, an inclined plasma torch, a rotary reactor and the cross trajectory injection of reactants were used to enhance the plasma heating efficiency. SiC UFP was synthesized by introducing Si powders to a rotating graphite crucible where it was heated by the plasma jet and the Si vapor so produced was subsequently carburized by CH[subscript 4] injected at the evaporator crucible exit. The SiC powder so obtained was of very fine particle size (20 - 40 nm). The sintering properties of the obtained SiC UFP was not satisfactory due to the high free Si and C content, originating from the unexpected very low and variable evaporation rate of Si in the plasma and thus poor controllability of the synthesis process. R. F. induction plasma technology possesses the unique characteristics of relatively large plasma volume, long residence time and availability of axial reactants injection, application of which ensured the Si vaporization and facilitated product powder quality control. The product powders, obtained from co-injected Si and CH[subscript 4], were characterized by XRD, ED, TGA, SEM, TEM, EPMA, IR, and BET. The combined results indicated that the purest SiC powder was able to be collected from the microfine filter, and was composed of both [alpha] and [beta]-phases of SiC, with only small amounts of free Si and C content. The particle size of the SiC powder was typically in the range of 40 to 60 nm, corresponding to a specific surface area of 30 to 50 m[superscript 2]/g. The initial <b>silicon</b> <b>evaporation</b> rate was found to depend strongly on the particle size of the starting Si powder. A parametric study of the synthesis showed that the quality of the powder obtained varied with the plasma plate power ant the position of the injection probe. The plasma gas composition employed was found to separately influence the proportions of [alpha] and [beta]-SiC in the synthesized SiC powder. With an Ar/N[subscript 2] mixture as the plasma gas, the ratio of the [alpha] to [beta] phases was less than 1. 0, whereas the ratio was greater than 1. 5 when using a mixture of Ar/H[subscript 2] as plasma gas. The Si powder feed rate and the input C/Si molar ratio in the injected reactants significantly affected both the formation of the SiC and the free Si and free C content in the synthesized powder. The use of a hot wall reactor through the lining of the cynlindrical plasma reactor wall with graphite, improved the conversion of Si to SiC. By appropriate selection of experimental conditions, SiC UFP of high purity (98 wt% SiC, 0. 3 wt% free Si, 1. 0 wt% free C. and other metallic elements) was obtained. The experimental results support the view that the formation mechanism for SiC UFP is dominated by the reaction of Si vapor with the thermal decomposition products of CH[subscript 4]. The plasma-synthesized SiC UFP was subjected to pressureledd sintering in an induction fumace in the presence of various sintering aids. With the addition of B[subscript 4]C (2. 0 wt% B) by mechanical mixing, the powders could be only partially densified, with the highest value, 84. 5 % of theoretical density achieved at 2170 °C for 30 min. Through the use of “in-flight” (in-situ) boron-doping of the powder during the plasma synthesis step (1. 65 wt% B), the UFP obtained could be densified to above 90 % of its TD at 2050 °C for 30 min. The addition of oxide sintering aids (3. 0 wt% Y[subscript 2]O[subscript 3] + 7. 0 wt% Al[subscript 2]O[subscript 3]) by mechanical mixing produce sintered pellet of 95 % of TD at 2000 °C fot 75 min. The Vickers microhardness of the sintered pellets produced in this case was as high as 31. 2 GPa, values that are superior to those for commercial [alpha]-SiC powder sintered under the same conditions. In order to improve our understanding of the basic phenomena involved, extensive microstructural (SEM, TEM), phase transformation (XRD, ED), physical (shrinkage, weight loss, porosity, hardness), as well as chemical analysis (PGNAA, EDS, XPS, TGA) were carried out. This helped establish a relationship between the properties of the as-synthesized powder and their sintering properties. The influences of sintering temperature, sintering time, additive concentration, and the powder purity on the densification behavior of the plasma-synthesized powders was investigated. The results were compared with data obtained using commercial powders...|$|E

Thermal annealing causes further phase segregation in film material, and it is transformed into SiO₂ (Si) composite. During such a process, silicon grains size decreases and their density increases. The model of electron field emission from the surface of such films was proposed. It was supposed that limitation process of the current flow under high electric fields is connected with Fowler-Nordheim tunneling through barriers Si-SiOх-vacuum or Si-vacuum.

30|$|The filling of {{intricate}} and large aspect ratio pores {{as is the}} case of PS is a difficult task. This is because using most traditional vapour phase deposition techniques, the vapour transport is strongly favoured near the entrance of the pores; then they eventually become obstructed, and the inner part of the pores remain empty. The use of isothermal close space sublimation (ICSS) technique for growing epitaxial or polycrystalline films in dependence of the type of substrate has been verified in previous publications [6, 7]. This technique uses alternate exposure to the different elemental sources in a regime {{in which there is no}} temperature difference between the source and the substrate. This allows regulation of the growth process. For this reason we explore the possibility of filling PS layers using this technique. We presented the growth of CdSe and ZnTe semiconductors inside the pores of porous <b>silicon</b> using alternated <b>evaporation</b> of elemental Cd, Zn, Te and Se.|$|R
30|$|The Ag {{thin film}} (10  nm) {{used in this}} work was {{deposited}} on <b>silicon</b> by thermal <b>evaporation</b> after the <b>silicon</b> substrate was cleaned by the RCA procedure. The post annealing was performed by rapid thermal processing at different temperatures (300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 700 °C) for 3  min in nitrogen. All samples were etched in etchant acid solution (H 2 O 2 /H 2 O/HF/C 2 H 5 OH[*]=[*] 20 : 8 : 4 : 8 volume ratio; concentrations of H 2 O 2 and HF are 30 % and 40 %, respectively) for 8  min at 35 °C. A silicon sample without Ag nanoparticle on its surface was etched by an etchant containing HAuCl 4 for 8  min at 35 °C, and all samples were kept in ethanol. The surface morphology was characterized by field emission scanning electronic microscopy (SEM); the optical properties were measured using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere detector.|$|R
40|$|A summary {{is given}} of {{different}} elementary processes influencing the thermal balance and energetic conditions of substrate surfaces during plasma processing. The discussed mechanisms include heat radiation, kinetic and potential energy of charged particles and neutrals {{as well as}} enthalpy of involved chemical surface reactions. The energy and momentum of particles originating from the plasma or electrodes, respectively, influence via energy flux density (energetic aspect) and substrate temperature (thermal aspect) the surface properties of the treated substrates. The various contributions to the energy balance are given in a modular mathematical framework form and examples for an estimation of heat fluxes and numerical values of relevant coefficients for energy transfer, etc. are given. For a few examples as titanium film deposition by hollow cathode arc <b>evaporation,</b> <b>silicon</b> etching in CF 4 glow discharge, plasma cleaning of contaminated metal surfaces, and magnetron sputtering of aluminum the energetic balance of substrates during plasma processing will be presented. Furthermore, {{the influence of the}} resulting substrate temperature on characteristic quantities as etching or deposition rates, layer density, microstructure, etc. will be illustrated for some examples, too...|$|R
40|$|A tracer {{technique}} using radioactive 31 Si (T 1 / 2 = 2. 62 h) {{was used}} to study solid-phase epitaxial growth (SPEG) of silicon. After depositing Pd and Si onto single-crystal substrates which had been activated in a nuclear reactor, Pd 2 Si was formed with about equal amounts of radioactive and nonradioactive silicon during heating at 400 °C for 5 min. After a second annealing stage (450 °C [...] > 500 °C in 1 h) the silicide layer which moves {{to the top of}} the sample during SPEG was etched off with aqua regia. From the absence of radioactive 31 Si in the etchant solution it is concluded that SPEG takes place by dissociation of the Pd 2 Si layer at the single-crystal interface to provide free Si for epitaxial growth, while new silicide is formed at the interface with the amorphous Si. These results were confirmed by evaporating radioactive silicon onto nonactivated <b>silicon</b> substrates before <b>evaporation</b> of Pd and stable amorphous Si and by measuring the activity in the SPEG sample before and after etching off the silicide layer...|$|R
40|$|Low-temperature (400 – 540 °C) {{crystallization}} of amorphous and polycrystalline Si films {{deposited on}} SiO 2 {{and covered with}} an evaporated Al layer has been studied using SEM, TEM, electron diffraction, electron channeling, and MeV 4 He + backscattering. <b>Silicon</b> deposited by <b>evaporation</b> and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at 640 °C (both amorphous) was found to crystallize into islands of polycrystalline aggregates. Silicon deposited by CVD at 900 °C (polycrystalline with ~ 2000 -Å grains) produced relatively large (~ 10 µm) single-crystal islands. In both cases island size increased with annealing time, {{and the rate of}} crystallization increased with temperature. Crystallization rates were observed to be the same for both sources of amorphous Si, while 900 °C CVD Si was noticeably slower, consistent with the postulate that the driving force for the reaction is the free-energy difference between initial and final states. The crystallization rate for 900 °C CVD Si decreased when the Al layer thickness was reduced to a value less than the initial Si grain size. The inclusion of a native oxide layer between the deposited Si and Al layers greatly retarded the crystallization process...|$|R
30|$|Various {{materials}} are employed {{to form the}} nanotips [8 – 10]. Among them, silicon {{is one of the}} most promising candidates to fabricate nanotips because it is the most used materials and ease of fabrication in the micro-electronic field [11 – 13]. Numerous technologies have been developed recently for the preparation of <b>silicon</b> nanotips, including <b>evaporation</b> deposition, electroplating, anisotropic wet etching method, and dry etching method [14 – 18]. Huang et al. used porous anodic alumina membrane as the mask and obtained a Si nanotip array by removing the silicon oxide [SiO 2] islands which were formed during anodization of the Al/Si interface [14]; Cheng et al. fabricated silicon nanotips through high-density hydrogen plasma etching [15]; Hsu et al. proposed a one-step and self-masked dry etching technique for fabricating uniform and high-single-crystal silicon nanotips [16]. These methods demonstrate simple processes to fabricate ultra-sharp nanotips. The alignment of nanotip array is, however, unsolvable issue because the nanotips are formed randomly by these methods. Linn et al. developed a microfabrication-compatible technology using inverted silicon pyramidal pits to fabricate the periodic gold nanopyramids with nanoscale sharp tips [18]. Using this method, aligned silicon tip is obtained, but it is difficult to fabricate nanotips with high aspect ratio and sharp end since only pyramidal shape structures are provided.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} to produce lithium plasma for plasma immersion ion implantation. Initially, an argon glow discharge with operation pressure ranging from 2 × 10 &# 8722; 1 to 1 mbar is generated by negatively polarizing an electrode from &# 8722; 400 to &# 8722; 1500 V. Small pieces of metallic lithium that are 99. 9 % pure fill {{the top of a}} conic crucible, with a depth of 2 cm, in electric contact with the electrode. Argon ions from the plasma are used to bombard this target, where heat is created by the momentum transfer from the impacting ions to the crucible. By controlling the operation pressure and the electrode voltage polarization, it is possible to easily heat the crucible to temperatures above the lithium melting point (180 &# 9702;C), causing its evaporation. Lithium atoms are then ionized, mainly due to collisions, with argon ions moving toward the crucible. Double Langmuir probe measurements indicated variation in the density of the discharge from 4 × 109 cm&# 8722; 3 to 1010 cm&# 8722; 3 after lithium <b>evaporation.</b> <b>Silicon</b> wafer pieces immersed in this mixed plasma were submitted to repetitive negative high-voltage pulses (3 kV/ 6 &# 956;s/ 2. 5 kHz) to accelerate plasma ions. High strain in the treated layers was measured by high-resolution X-ray diffraction. Photoluminescence intensity increased after annealing. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry measurement revealed lithium implantation in silicon with an atomic concentration of 78 % on the top surface and a penetration depth of about 75 nm.

40|$|Nano-engineered catalysts, and {{a method}} of {{fabricating}} them, have been developed in a continuing effort to improve the performances of direct methanol fuel cells as candidate power sources to supplant primary and secondary batteries {{in a variety of}} portable electronic products. In order to realize the potential for high energy densities (as much as 1. 5 W h/g) of direct methanol fuel cells, {{it will be necessary to}} optimize the chemical compositions and geometric configurations of catalyst layers and electrode structures. High performance can be achieved when catalyst particles and electrode structures have the necessary small feature sizes (typically of the order of nanometers), large surface areas, optimal metal compositions, high porosity, and hydrophobicity. The present method involves electrodeposition of one or more catalytic metal(s) or a catalytic-metal/polytetrafluoroethylene nanocomposite on an alumina nanotemplate. The alumina nanotemplate is then dissolved, leaving the desired metal or metal/polytetrafluoroethylene-composite catalyst layer. Unlike some prior methods of making fine metal catalysts, this method does not involve processing at elevated temperature; all processing can be done at room temperature. In addition, this method involves fewer steps and is more amenable to scaling up for mass production. Alumina nanotemplates are porous alumina membranes that have been fabricated, variously, by anodizing either pure aluminum or aluminum that has been deposited on <b>silicon</b> by electronbeam <b>evaporation.</b> The diameters of the pores (7 to 300 nm), areal densities of pores (as much as 7 x 10 (exp 10) sq cm), and lengths of pores (up to about 100 nm) can be tailored by selection of fabrication conditions. In a given case, the catalytic metal, catalytic metal alloy, or catalytic metal/ polytetrafluoroethylene composite is electrodeposited in the pores of the alumina nanotemplate. The dimensions of the pores, together with the electrodeposition conditions, determine the sizes and surface areas of the catalytic particles. Hence, the small features and large surface areas of the porosity translate to the desired small particle size and large surface area of the catalyst (see figure). When polytetrafluoroethylene is included, it is for the purpose of imparting hydrophobicity in order to prevent water from impeding the desired diffusion of gases through the catalyst layer. To incorporate polytetrafluoroethylene into a catalytic-metal/polytetrafluoroethylene nanocomposite, one suspends polytetrafluoroethylene nanoparticles in the electrodeposition solution. The polytetrafluoroethylene content can be varied to obtain the desired degree of hydrophobicity and permeability by gas...|$|R
