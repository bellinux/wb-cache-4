The foundation continues to run a program that Payton organized to donate toys to underprivileged children across the Chicago area each Christmas.

5|$|She portrayed {{a wealthy}} {{university}} patron in Chen Shi-zheng's much-delayed feature drama Dark Matter, {{a film about}} a Chinese science graduate student who becomes violent after dealing with academic politics at a U.S. university.

25|$|Understanding {{contemporary}} Quebec {{nationalism is}} difficult considering the ongoing debates {{on the political}} status of the province and its complex public opinion.

25|$|Southwest Airlines, {{founded in}} 1971 and {{headquartered}} at Love Field, built its business on selling quick, no-frills trips between Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio.

In 1973 the courts ruled that the City of Dallas could not restrict Southwest Airlines from operating out of Love Field, so long as it remained open as an airport. This ruling effectively granted Southwest the right to continue to operate its existing intrastate service out of Love Field. The airlines operating from Love Field at the time DFW was conceived executed agreements with DFW stipulating that no airline could operate at the new airport if it continued to operate any flights out of Love Field. Southwest, created after the other carriers had <b>signed</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> DFW operating agreements, was not a signatory and remained as the only airline operating at Love Field.|$|E
