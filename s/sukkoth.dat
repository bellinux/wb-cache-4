5000|$|The Israelites' first {{journey is}} from Ramesses to Succoth.

Isaiah prophesied that the rebuilt Temple will be a house of prayer for all nations.

From this time onwards Aden served as an important community centre and became crucial as a port from the commercial sea lanes between the Mediterranean sea, India and further into the far east.
