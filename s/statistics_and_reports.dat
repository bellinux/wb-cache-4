25|$|Poverty {{cannot be}} defined only by <b>statistics</b> <b>and</b> <b>reports,</b> {{such as the}} poverty line, {{to see whether or}} not people are impoverished in their {{respective}} countries. The concept of social and cultural exclusion helps to better convey poverty as a process that involves multiple agents. Many developing countries have social and cultural norms that prevent women from having access to formal employment. Especially in parts of Asia, North Africa, and Latin America, the cultural and social norms do not allow women to have much labor productivity outside the home as well as an economic bargaining position within the household. This social inequality deprives women of capabilities, particularly employment, which leads to women having a higher risk of poverty. This increase in occupational gender segregation and widening of the gender wage gap increases women's susceptibility to poverty.|$|E
