50|$|A {{hypersonic}} {{wind tunnel}} {{is designed to}} generate a hypersonic flow field in the working section, thus simulating the typical flow features of this flow regime - including compression shocks and pronounced boundary layer effects, entropy layer and viscous interaction zones and most importantly high total temperatures of the flow. The speed of these tunnels vary from Mach 5 to 15. The power requirement of a wind tunnel increases with the cross section, the flow density and is directly proportional to the third power of the test velocity. Hence installation of a continuous, {{closed circuit wind tunnel}} remains a costly affair. The first continuous Mach 7-10 wind tunnel with 1x1 m test section was planned at Kochel am See, Germany during WW II and finally put into operation as 'Tunnel A' in the late 1950s at AEDC Tullahoma, TN, USA for an installed power of 57 MW. In view of these high facility demands, also intermittently operated experimental facilities like blow-down wind tunnels are designed and installed to simulate the hypersonic flow. A hypersonic wind tunnel comprises in flow direction the main components: heater/cooler arrangements, dryer, convergent/divergent nozzle, test section, <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> and diffuser. A blow-down wind tunnel has a low vacuum reservoir at the back end, while a continuously operated, closed circuit wind tunnel has a high power compressor installation instead. Since the temperature drops with the expanding flow, the air inside the test section has the chance of becoming liquefied. For that reason, preheating is particularly critical (the nozzle may require cooling).|$|E
40|$|A {{flexible}} <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> {{supersonic diffuser}} {{has been tested}} in the GALCIT 2 - 1 / 2 inch supersonic wind tunnel at Mach numbers of 2. 60 and 3. 33. The theoretical minimum area relation for starting a supersonic tunnel has been checked at the two Mach numbers, and the amount by which {{the height of the}} <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> may be reduced after the tunnel has been started was determined. Minimum compression ratios for the starting and reduced <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> conditions have been determined and compared with those previously found here and theoretically estimated by Crocco. Effect of nozzle surface roughness on supersonic flow is noted, and Schlieren photographs representing the flow in a variety of conditions are presented. A series of Schlieren photographs shows the flow in the <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> at progressively greater amounts of area reduction. The theoretical minimum <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> area relation was found to predict the <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> size for starting within 3 percent at both Mach numbers, being conservative by that amount in both cases. Only about 1 / 3 of the theoretically predicted reduction of <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> area after starting was realized at both Mach numbers before separation of the boundary layer broke down flow throughout the nozzle. Minimum compression ratios were reduced some 9 and 6 percent for Mach numbers 2. 60 and 3. 33 respectively. These decreases, though not as large as anticipated, nevertheless have the lowest compression ratios ever measured in the GALCIT tunnel, ratios less than Crocco's estimate, heretofore never realized. Transition, though not occurring by means of a normal shock wave, was found to be stable a few inches downstream of the <b>second</b> <b>throat.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Second-throat {{diffusers}} {{serve to}} isolate rocket engines {{from the effects}} of ambient back pressure during testing without using active control systems. Among the most critical design parameters is the relative area of the diffuser throat to that of the nozzle throat. A smaller <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> is generally desirable because it decreases the stagnation-to-ambient pressure ratio the diffuser requires for nominal operation. There is a limit, however. Below a certain size, the <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> can cause pressure buildup within the diffuser and prevent it from reaching the start condition that protects the nozzle from side-load damage. This paper presents a method for improved estimation of the minimum <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> area which enables diffuser start. The new 3 -zone model uses traditional quasi-one-dimensional compressible flow theory to approximate the structure of two distinct diffuser flow fields observed in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and combines them to provide a less-conservative estimate of the <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> size limit. It is unique among <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> sizing methods in that it accounts for all major conical nozzle and <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> diffuser design parameters within its limits of application. The performance of the 3 -zone method is compared to the historical normal shock and force balance methods, and verified against a large number of CFD simulations at specific heat ratios of 1. 4 and 1. 25.

40|$|Computational {{simulations}} {{and wind}} tunnel testing {{were conducted to}} explore {{the operation of the}} Abe Silverstein Supersonic Wind Tunnel at the NASA Glenn Research Center at test section Mach numbers above the current limit of Mach 3. 5. An increased Mach number would enhance the capability for testing of supersonic and hypersonic propulsion systems. The focus of the explorations was on understanding the flow within the <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> of the tunnel, which is downstream of the test section and is where the supersonic flow decelerates to subsonic flow. Methods of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were applied to provide details of the shock boundary layer structure and to estimate losses in total pressure.

Wind tunnel testing was able to confirm such operation of the tunnel at Mach 3. 6 and 3. 7 before a hydraulic failure caused a stop to the testing.

This paper describes a series of tests conducted on four diffuser configurations to better understand the effects of inlet geometry and throat area on starting behavior and boundary layer separation. The diffusers were tested for a duration of five seconds with a 1455 -pound thrust, LO 2 /GH 2 thruster to ensure they each reached aerodynamic steady state. The effects of a water spray ring at the diffuser exits and a water-cooled deflector plate were also evaluated. Static pressure and temperature measurements were taken at multiple axial locations along the diffusers, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used as a tool to aid in the interpretation of data. The hot combustion products were confirmed to enable the diffuser start condition with tighter <b>second</b> <b>throats</b> than predicted by historical cold-flow data or the theoretical normal shock method. Both aerodynamic performance and heat transfer were found to increase with smaller diffuser throats. Spray ring and deflector cooling water had negligible impacts on diffuser boundary layer separation.

40|$|In a {{supersonic}} wind tunnel, {{the contour}} of the nozzle, the <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> setting and {{the stagnation pressure}} controlled by the Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV) are fundamental parameters without which the required Mach number in the test section cannot be achieved.

Since these two are totally independent dynamical systems with their own time contrants, proper matching of the two is necessary for efficient handling and operation of the complete wind tunnel. Mach number in the VMFN is controlled by a single hydraulic jack, which outputs a voltage proportional to its displacement (Temposonic sensor). For every Mach number, there exists a certain minimum (safe) stagnation pressure that must be delivered and maintained by the PRV.

Some level of escapement from the net is expected because an opening exists in each throat of the net, although factors infl uencing rates of escapement from hoop nets have not been quantified. We conducted experiments to quantify rates of escapement and to determine the infl uence of throat configuration and fish density within the net on escapement rates. An initial experiment to determine the rate of escapement from each net compartment utilized individually tagged channel catfish placed within the entrance (between the two throats) and cod (within the <b>second</b> <b>throat)</b> compartments of a single hoop net for overnight sets. From this experiment, the mean rate (±SE) of channel catfish escaping was 4. 2 % (± 1. 5) from the cod (cod throat was additionally restricted from the traditionally manufactured product), and 74 % (± 4. 2) from the entrance compartments. In a subsequent experiment, channel catfish were placed only in the cod compartment with different throat configurations (restricted or unrestricted) and at two densities (low [6 fish per net] and high [60 fish per net]) for overnight sets to determine the infl uence of fish density and throat configuration on escapement rates. Escapement rates between throat configurations were doubled at low fish density (13. 3 ± 5. 4 % restricted versus 26. 7 ± 5. 6 % unrestricted) and tripled at high fish density (14. 3 ± 4. 9 % restricted versus 51. 9 ± 5. 0 % unrestricted).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of once-daily amoxicillin vs intramuscular benzathine penicillin G in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis. Material & Methods: Children 6 - 15 years of age presenting to a private pediatric clinic with GABHS pharyngitis in the urban population of Mashhad, Iran. Prospective randomized controlled study in which patients were randomly assigned to receive orally amoxicillin (750 mg once daily) for 10 days versus a single shot of intramuscular benzathin penicillin G (600. 000 - 1. 200. 000 IU). They received orally amoxicillin by a health worker and compliance was monitored. After 48 hours if the first throat culture was positive, the patients were reevaluated by the same physician, and a <b>second</b> <b>throat</b> culture was obtained to evaluate bacteriologic response to treatment. Ninety-nine patients had throat swabs that yielded positive results on culture. In the latter group, 31 children were randomly assigned to receive intramuscularly penicillin, and 68 children were randomly assigned to receive once-daily amoxicillin. Outcomes were measured by impact on the clinical course and response, eradication of GABHS within 48 hours and compliance. Eleven of the amoxicillin-treated patients refused to take the drug, were noncompliant, or did not return for the follow-up visit. Three of this group, had residual positive culture 48 hours after treatment, and had bacteriologic failure with intramuscular penicillin. These were excluded as carriers, leaving 54 amoxicillin-treated patients. The children in the two treatment groups were comparable with respect to age and, gender. Findings: There were no significant differences in the clinical and bacteriological response, bacteriologic failure and residual positive cultures between the two groups after 48 hours. In the amoxicillin group, 18. 9 % failed to respond to treatment compared to 6. 4 % in the penicillin group. The difference was not statistically significant (P-value = 0. 1).

40|$|Aim: Some years ago, in the {{framework}} of the Motar Cooperation Agreement between ONERA and DLR, it had been agreed to carry out comparison testing of the two instationary PSP methods on a common test configuration with an unsteady flow produced in a suitable wind tunnel. The results from this comparison would form the basis for a benchmarking of the two different approaches, leading to an aid in decision-making as to which method is better suited for a particular application. / Test configuration: For many years there has been interest at ONERA on the (quasi) two-dimensional unsteady transonic flow in a channel with strong interactions between an oscillating shock and a separated boundary layer: various diagnostic methods were used in measurements on their S 8 Ch transonic wind tunnel at ONERA Meudon (Schlieren, pressure sensors, PIV, LDV), including also PSP with Ru/AA paint (uPSP). Flow separation of the boundary layer is produced over a convex contour profile (a bump) {{on the floor of the}} tunnel, with the subsequent flow acceleration leading to formation of a downstream shock wave. The sectional area of a <b>second</b> <b>throat,</b> situated downstream of the bump, is varied periodically (ca. 15 Hz or higher) by rotation of an elliptical rod (cam) placed downstream of the throat position, leading to forced upstream pressure fluctuations and hence an oscillation (movement in flow direction) in the shock position. The resulting pressure fluctuations on the bump can then be measured with the help of pressure sensors (Kulite) fixed in the floor, and also with PSP coated on the floor. / Procedure/Approach: The floor can also be coated with the DLR iPSP paint. As with ONERA, there exists sufficient optical access for placement of the DLR excitation LEDs and cameras adjacent to or above the test section. PSP measurements were then be carried out with a new set of measurements using both ONERA and DLR paints, consecutively. / Results: Pressure measurements with Kulite and iPSP/uPSP are compared. Phase correlation is good, but there remain some differences in amplitude for both paints. Static and instationary calibration were carried out on samples of both paints; the latter showed no phase loss up to 120 Hz, although the amplitude with iPSP dropped due to surface heating by the LED over time. Fourier analyses of Kulite and PSP showed good agreement. A table was compiled with a summary of characteristics for both paints: there is no “better” paint, since the choice is governed mainly by desired application...|$|E
40|$|Two main {{goals are}} pursued in this research, firstly a better {{correlation}} between two grain size measuring devices, for the mud content specifically has been established. Secondly, a grain size based work flow, developed by Daza, 2012 at TNO, to calculate permeability and capillary seal capacity of mudstones, has been calibrated, extended and improved. First of all, {{to obtain a}} better correlation, the first data set was applied, containing samples of the Rupel Clay Formation, Netherlands, and a core derived from the Belgian Boom Clay. The Belgian Boom Clay has been a target for nuclear waste disposal for decades and recently the Rupel Clay Formation has been targeted for the same reasons. These two formations are basically the same formation. Clay formations have a high permeability which is highly preferred with nuclear waste storage. The issues with the devices {{is that in the}} Netherlands, the laser diffractor is applied while in Belgium the sedigraph is used and the results are not directly comparable. It has been shown that the laser diffractor underestimates the clay fraction of the sample with respect to the sedigraph. Therefore a first step in this research is to calibrate these two grain size results. Grain size analysis of this data set has been carried out by both measuring devices and in total 16 boreholes in the Netherlands have been investigated and one core was derived from the Belgian nuclear waste disposal project. The depth of these samples ranges from 20 - 736 m, indicating that some of the samples are of very shallow depths. In the literature, the clay fraction results should be comparable when for the laser diffractor a grain size of 8 μm is applied and for the sedigraph 2 μm. In this research a new correlation has been established at 5 μm for the laser diffractor compared to 2 μm with the sedigraph. With this improved correlation, the workflow can be continued. A next step is to integrate the improved correlation into the workflow. The workflow starts off with calculations based on formulas developed by Yang and Aplin. They established equations relating pressure coefficients to porosity and permeability, based on the clay fraction of the sample. This part of the workflow has been calibrated with a second data set, completely derived from 4 boreholes of the Boom Clay, in a synthesis research. These relationships are however for homogenous mudstone samples. Therefore to improve the workflow, heterogeneity calculations, based on Drews relationships have been implemented. Drews developed in his PhD thesis several equations relating effective stress to porosity and eventually porosity to permeability. All relationships are developed for a specific clay fraction ranging from 50 % clay to 100 % clay. A fourth step in this research is to select a third data set. This time a closer look was taken at the muddy cap rocks overlying the shallow gas fields, offshore northern Netherlands. The samples were derived from the A and B blocks. In total 4 cores and 49 cuttings were carefully selected in the cap rocks above the gas accumulations in order to have calibration points. The depth of these samples ranges from 312 - 1044 m. In the sedimentological lab at the VU, these samples were analyzed by laser diffraction. These samples were implemented to verify the workflow and the calculations were carried out according to the new correlation for the clay fraction. The last step in this research is to extend the workflow, therefore 2 alternative pore throat calculation methods have been implemented. The first method is the equivalent grain size method by Nakayama and Sato. They converted pore throats into grain size by using a theoretical relation of COEF, which is the ratio of pore throat to grain size. Then this grain size is used to evaluate top seal capacity. The <b>second</b> alternative pore <b>throat</b> calculation method is the critical grain size method of d 10 method, by Nordgård Bolås et al. Here the size of the critical pore throats is important to a cap rock's seal capacity. When this workflow is carried out, there will be 12 calculations of seal capacities, 6 of these seal capacities will have the heterogeneity incorporated and 6 will assume homogenous samples. In order to calibrate the computed seal capacities with the shallow gas fields, an interpretation will be made of seismic images indicating gas columns and NPHI-RHOB cross-overs, depth contour maps, and production plans. This results in the selection of three methods that render the most accurate seal capacities, two of them are based on the integration of the equivalent grain size method with and without heterogeneity calculations; the other on the critical grain size method...|$|R
