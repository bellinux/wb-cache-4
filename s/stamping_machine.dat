25|$|BVG ride-passes {{are issued}} for {{specific}} periods of time, and most require validation with a <b>stamping</b> <b>machine</b> {{before they are}} first used. The validation shows the date and {{time of the first}} use, and where the ticket was validated (in code), and therefore when the ticket expires. For example, once validated, an all-day pass allows unlimited use from the time of purchase to 3:00 am the following day. Unlike most other metro systems, tickets in Berlin are not checked before entering tram, U-Bahn or S-Bahn stations. They are however checked by the bus drivers upon entering. On the tram, S-Bahn and U-Bahn, a proof-of-payment system is used: there are random spot checks inside by plainclothes fare inspectors who have the right to demand to see each passenger's ticket. Passengers found without a ticket or an expired/invalid ticket are fined €60 per incident. The passenger may be required to pay on the spot, and is required on the spot to give a valid address to which the relevant fine notice can be mailed (it {{does not have to be}} in Germany). On the third incident, the BVG calls the offender to court, as there is now a history of 'riding without paying'.|$|E
2500|$|Concessionaires {{inside the}} hall {{carried on a}} lively business. A man at a <b>stamping</b> <b>machine</b> put copper caps on pennies {{with the head of}} Lincoln {{on one side and the}} {{inscription}} ff Morro Castle Fire, September, 1934, Asbury Park" [...] on the other. Postcard sellers in the hall disposed of 150,000 pictures of the burning ship during the first few days after the disaster. As soon as they came off the press, heart-rending poems and ballads about the fire were hawked about.|$|E

50|$|In 1937, Kay {{began to}} produce a 3/4 size upright bass, which is widely {{believed}} to be their Concert or C-1 bass. Like their guitar manufacturing, the basses were hand crafted by skilled craftsmen using special ordered machinery. They even had a hot <b>stamping</b> <b>machine</b> that could emboss the trademark KAY cursive script.|$|E
50|$|In a hot <b>stamping</b> <b>machine,</b> a die {{is mounted}} and heated, with {{the product to}} be stamped placed beneath it. A metallized or painted roll-leaf carrier is {{inserted}} between the two, and the die presses down through it. The dry paint or foil used is impressed into {{the surface of the}} product. The dye-stamping process itself is non-polluting because the materials involved are dry.|$|E
50|$|Together with Gustav Adolph Hansen, Krag {{developed}} the Krag-Hansen <b>stamping</b> <b>machine</b> (Krag-Hansen-maskinen) {{for which they}} received patents dating from 1904. Krag also received additional patents on the further development of the machine. In 1934, Den Norske Frankeringsmaskin was established {{for the purpose of}} marketing franking machines under an exclusive agreement with Krag Maskinfabrikk A/S. In 2000, the company was sold to Pitney Bowes Inc.|$|E

25|$|An {{experiment}} of 1932 was {{the addition}} of a <b>stamp</b> vending <b>machine</b> {{to the end of the}} post box. This necessitated an oval planform for the box even though it was only provided with a single posting aperture. At one end of the oval is the <b>stamp</b> <b>machine</b> and at the other is the posting aperture. The boxes have two doors; one for clearance of mail and one for emptying the cash and reloading the <b>stamp</b> <b>machines.</b> The machines were set to vend two halfpenny stamps in exchange for one old penny, the stamps being supplied in a long continuously wound roll known as a coil. Boxes were again made in two sizes, designated Type D and Type E, and carried raised lettering on the castings indicating the position of the <b>stamp</b> vending <b>machine,</b> as well as an array of small enamel plates warning users of the danger of bent coins and the need to wait for stamps to be issued before inserting more money. Several of each have survived in use in England and in the Isle of Man.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally manual {{systems were}} used {{that rely on}} highly skilled people laboriously adding up paper cards which have times stamped onto them using a time <b>{{stamping}}</b> <b>machine</b> such as the Bundy Clock. Time stamping machines were used {{for over a century}} but have since been phased out and replaced with cheaper automated systems which eliminate the need for payroll staff to manually input employee hours.|$|E
50|$|In 1908 he {{was selling}} check-endorsing machines, {{and a year later}} he bought the Universal <b>Stamping</b> <b>Machine</b> Company. Within a few years, his company had {{established}} relationships with the U.S. Postal Service, providing stamp-cancelling machines on a rental basis. Between 1912 and 1917 he achieved prominence in postal circles for his promotion of permit printing of mail. He expanded internationally, selling his machines to Germany, England and Canada. In 1917, he moved his operation to Stamford, Connecticut.|$|E
50|$|In 1919, Pitney {{joined forces}} with Walter Bowes, an {{entrepreneur}} who had achieved prominence in postal circles through his company, the Universal <b>Stamping</b> <b>Machine</b> Company, which manufactured post office canceling machines. In 1920, the two companies merged to create the Pitney-Bowes Postage Meter Company. In 1926, PBPM Co. (as it was then known) merged with Edward Franks' Franking Company of America and was consolidated and renamed as the Franks Universal Postage Company, or {{sometimes referred to as}} The Universal Postage Trust.|$|E
50|$|Later in the 2010, {{automated}} stamp {{and bank}} {{automatic teller machines}} began dispensing thinner stamps. The thin stamps were {{to make it easier}} for automated <b>stamp</b> <b>machines</b> to dispense and to make the stamps more environmentally friendly.|$|R
50|$|The company {{produced}} {{a line of}} special presses adapted for sheet metal work, power <b>stamping</b> <b>machines,</b> automobile parts, torpedoes, shrapnel and armor-piercing projectiles.

5000|$|The {{central section}} is largely {{taken up by}} a {{depiction}} of Coatlicue, Aztec Goddess of Life, merged with a huge <b>stamping</b> <b>machine</b> from Detroit, symbolizing the union between north and south. It is echoed throughout the section in the depiction of the modern carver (Carter) eschewing motorized tools for hand axes, in Kahlo looking for inspiration in native traditions (and dressed in native clothes), and in the symbolic joining of Rivera (from Mexico) and Goddard (from America) holding the [...] "Tree of Life and Love" [...] together.|$|E
5000|$|The direct {{inspiration}} for the unremitting desperate violence was the recent [...] "Battle of Alcatraz" [...] (May 2-4, 1946) in which prisoners fought a hopeless two-day battle rather than surrender {{in the aftermath of}} a failed escape attempt. The film has a number of brutal scenes including the crushing of a stool pigeon prisoner under a <b>stamping</b> <b>machine</b> and the beating of a prisoner bound to a chair by straps. Film writer Eddie Muller wrote that [...] "the climax of Brute Force displayed the most harrowing violence ever seen in movie theaters." ...|$|E
50|$|The Butter Box Factory is a timber-framed {{building}} with a corrugated iron roof and corrugated iron and timber walls. There are two enclosures within the factory, one a tongue and groove partition with a bench and shelves at the north-east section of the building, the other a small plywood office in the south-east corner. Machinery used for box production is in situ including a series of four multiple saw tables, separate rip saw, brand <b>stamping</b> <b>machine</b> and guillotine. A winch and drive shaft is also present, but removed from its original location. Spare, excess and disused equipment is currently stored in this factory.|$|E
50|$|Toyota's first {{improvement}} was to place precision measurement devices on the transfer <b>stamping</b> <b>machines,</b> {{and record the}} necessary measurements for each model's die.

50|$|There are {{two primary}} types of foil <b>stamping</b> <b>machines.</b> The first type is manual {{and the second}} is {{pneumatic}} (air powered), which typically used in a commercial print shop. Manual foil stampers are ideal for low jobs and the pneumatic is ideal for medium to high-volume jobs.|$|R

50|$|In some countries, like Italy, {{and some}} local {{railways}} in Germany, conductors are not used. Instead passengers {{are expected to}} validate tickets in a special <b>stamping</b> <b>machine</b> before entering the train. A system of coupons that are validated with a special machine exists on the Mumbai Suburban Railway where combinations of coupons of different denominations are used to get the corresponding ticket value. There {{may or may not}} be a conductor later on double-checking that correct tickets are actually held. Yet further systems are possible, for example in Japan, the London Underground and in local traffic in Stockholm, the platforms are physically blocked, forcing the acquisition of a ticket before entering the platform.|$|E
50|$|Seton {{was founded}} in 1956 as the Seton Name Plate Corporation in New Haven by Fenmore R. Seton. While still in the Air Force, in free time, Seton and his wife Phyllis started a {{part-time}} mail order business from their home, specializing in personalized Christmas cards for individuals with the surname 'Smith'. To meet the demand for their product, the Setons purchased a small table-top hot-stamping machine. In 1952, they purchased an attachment for their <b>stamping</b> <b>machine</b> to make doorbell nameplates. They went on to produce display boards for local hardware stores. In 1954, the service manager of a large Carrier Air Conditioning contractor in New Haven noticed one of the Setons' display boards and requested that they produce some specialized nameplates for his company.|$|E

5000|$|In 1902, Arthur Pitney {{patented}} {{his first}} [...] "double-locking" [...] hand-cranked postage-stamping machine, and, with patent attorney Eugene A. Rummler, founded the Pitney Postal Machine Company. In 1908, English emigrant {{and founder of}} the Universal <b>Stamping</b> <b>Machine</b> Company Walter Bowes began providing stamp-canceling machines to the United States Postal Service. Bowes moved his operations to Stamford in 1917. A rapid increase in mail volume in 1919 made the Post Office more receptive to metered mail, and Pitney subsequently traveled to meet Bowes. On March 15, 1920, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill authorizing mechanical stamps on First-Class Mail, and on April 23, 1920, the two companies merged to form the Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company, with the goal of producing a machine that would combine Pitney's [...] "double-locking" [...] counter with Bowes' system for wrapping postage payment, postmarking and cancellation. The United States Post Office approved their postage meter on August 25, 1920.|$|E
