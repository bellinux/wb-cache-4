5|$|Manne's {{father and}} uncles were drummers. In his youth he admired {{many of the}} leading swing drummers of the day, {{especially}} Jo Jones and Dave Tough. Billy Gladstone, a colleague of Manne's father and the most admired percussionist on the New York theatrical scene, offered the teenage Shelly tips and encouragement. From that time, Manne rapidly developed his style in the clubs of 52nd Street in New York in the late 1930s and 1940s. His first professional job with a known big band was with the Bobby Byrne Orchestra in 1940. In those years, as he became known, he recorded with jazz stars like Coleman Hawkins, Charlie <b>Shavers,</b> and Don Byas. He also worked {{with a number of}} musicians mainly associated with Duke Ellington, like Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, Lawrence Brown, and Rex Stewart.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} four episodes, the show gained its initial sponsor when Dr. Jules Montenier paid to have his product, Stopette spray deodorant, {{featured}} in advertising on the program. This involved featuring the product in the show's opening, {{on the front of}} the panel's desk, above the sign-in board, and on Daly's scorecards. In his last years, Cerf explained to interviewer Robbin Hawkins that Dr. Montenier was ultimately ruined by his refusal to abandon or share sponsorship as the show entered new markets and became too expensive. After Dr. Montenier sold Stopette to Helene Curtis, the series was sponsored by a variety of companies which were either regular or rotating. Sponsors were accorded the same exposure on the set as Stopette. One of the first rotating sponsors, which actually came before Montenier's sale of Stopette to Helene Curtis (who continued to sponsor the program after the purchase and still promoted Stopette in their advertising), was the Remington Rand Corporation, who used their time to promote their line of electric <b>shavers</b> and business machines such as the UNIVAC.|$|E
25|$|The {{win over}} the title-contending Cobb gave Norton another shot at a {{potential}} title-fight, and on May 11, 1981. at Madison Square Garden {{he stepped into the}} ring with top contender Gerry Cooney, who, like Cobb, was undefeated entering the fight. Very early in the fight it became clear that Norton was no longer the caliber of fighter he once was, as Cooney's first punch caused Norton's legs to buckle. Norton continued to take shots from Cooney in his corner for nearly a full minute before Perez, who refereed his last fight, stepped in to stop the bout 54 seconds in, as Norton was slumped in his corner. Norton decided to retire following the match and turned his attention to charitable pursuits. Norton's enduring legacy as a fighter is that he is considered second to Joe Frazier as Ali's main nemesis and toughest opponent. Norton fought Ali to three decisions and was never hurt or knocked down. All three bouts were close and subject to controversy. Unfortunately, Norton was less successful against three of the greatest punchers of all time, losing by KO to Foreman and <b>Shavers</b> and by TKO to Cooney. Norton was considered past his prime in boxing from 1979 to 1981.|$|E

Burke's mother responded at 2:15 PM that same day that [...] "He has not made any decision" [...] about going pro, according to Yahoo! Sports reporter Eric Adelson.

500|$|In 1946 Sinatra {{released}} [...] "Oh! What it Seemed to Be", [...] "Day by Day", [...] "They Say It's Wonderful", [...] "Five Minutes More" [...] and [...] "The Coffee Song" [...] as singles, {{and launched}} his first album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, [...] which reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic noted that Sinatra [...] "took the material very seriously, singing the love lyrics with utter seriousness", {{and that his}} [...] "singing and the classically influenced settings gave the songs unusual depth of meaning". He was soon selling ten million records a year. Such was Sinatra's command at Columbia that his love of conducting was indulged {{with the release of}} the set Frank Sinatra Conducts the Music of Alec Wilder, an offering unlikely to appeal to Sinatra's core fanbase at the time, which consisted of teenage girls. The following year he released his second album, Songs by Sinatra, featuring songs of a similar mood and tempo such as Irving Berlin's [...] "How Deep is the Ocean?" [...] and Harold Arlen's and Jerome Kern's [...] "All The Things You Are". [...] "Mam'selle", composed by Edmund Goulding with lyrics by Mack Gordon for the film The Razor's Edge (1946), was released as a single. Sinatra had competition; versions by Art Lund, Dick Haymes, Dennis Day, and The Pied Pipers also reached the top ten of the Billboard charts. In December he recorded [...] "Sweet Lorraine" [...] with the Metronome All-Stars, featuring talented jazz musicians such as Coleman Hawkins, Harry Carney and Charlie <b>Shavers,</b> with Nat King Cole on piano, in what Charles L. Granata describes as [...] "one of the highlights of Sinatra's Columbia epoch".|$|E
2500|$|After {{losing to}} Holmes, Norton won his next fight by {{knockout}} over sixth-ranked Randy Stephens in 1978 before taking on Earnie <b>Shavers</b> in another compulsory WBC title eliminator fight in Las Vegas on March 23, 1979. It appeared {{for the first}} time that Norton's career had perhaps hit a decline, particularly after the Holmes match as <b>Shavers</b> took the former champion out in the first round. But it also created a view that his confidence wasn't good against all-time great hitters Foreman, <b>Shavers</b> and later Cooney. Although Norton himself always denied this and he was past his prime when he was stopped by <b>Shavers</b> and Cooney. [...] (Norton's peak was 1973â€“1978.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Some modern Jewish {{religious}} {{legislators in}} Orthodox Judaism, including Rabbi Moshe Feinstein and Rabbi Yosef Eliyahu Henkin, permit {{the use of}} electric razors for the purpose of remaining clean-shaven, because, in their view, electric razors work like scissors, cutting by trapping hair between the blades and a metal grating. However, other modern Jewish Rabbinical authorities, such as Rabbi Avraham Yeshayahu Karelitz and Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky, consider electric razors, particularly rotary models which use [...] "Lift and Cut" [...] heads made by Philips, to work in the manner of primitive razors, and consequently prohibit their use. According to some interpretations of the permissive view, these <b>shavers</b> can be used if the lifters attached to the shaver's cutters are removed first. According to other interpretations of this view, these <b>shavers</b> can be used without removing the lifters, and, indeed, according to some, it may even be preferable not to do so.|$|E
