5|$|When the {{two sons}} of {{the chief of the}} gods {{fell in love with a}} {{beautiful}} maiden named Loowit, she could not choose between them. The two young chiefs fought over her, burying villages and forests in the process. The area was devastated and the earth shook <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> that the huge bridge fell into the river, creating the cascades of the Columbia River Gorge.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 51 {{provides}} {{a detailed account}} of Ragnarök interspersed with various quotes from Völuspá, while chapters 52 and 53 describe the aftermath of these events. In Chapter 51, High states that the first sign of Ragnarök will be Fimbulwinter, during which time three winters will arrive without a summer, and the sun will be useless. High details that, prior to these winters, three earlier winters will have occurred, marked with great battles throughout the world. During this time, greed will cause brothers to kill brothers, and fathers and sons will suffer from the collapse of kinship bonds. High then quotes stanza 45 of Völuspá. Next, High describes that the wolf will swallow the sun, then his brother will swallow the moon, and mankind will consider the occurrence as a great disaster resulting in much ruin. The stars will disappear. The earth and mountains will shake <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> that the trees will come loose from the soil, the mountains will topple, and all restraints will break, causing Fenrir to break free from his bonds.|$|E
5|$|If a star is massive enough, {{its core}} will {{eventually}} become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon to neon, {{and then to}} fuse neon to iron. Such a star will not become a white dwarf, because the mass of its central, non-fusing core, initially supported by electron degeneracy pressure, will eventually exceed the largest possible mass supportable by degeneracy pressure. At this point {{the core of the}} star will collapse and it will explode in a core-collapse supernova which will leave behind a remnant neutron star, black hole, or possibly a more exotic form of compact star. Some main-sequence stars, of perhaps 8 to 10 , although sufficiently massive to fuse carbon to neon and magnesium, may be insufficiently massive to fuse neon. Such a star may leave a remnant white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that its core does not collapse, and provided that fusion does not proceed <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> as to blow apart the star in a supernova. Although a few white dwarfs have been identified which may be of this type, most evidence for the existence of such comes from the novae called ONeMg or neon novae. The spectra of these novae exhibit abundances of neon, magnesium, and other intermediate-mass elements which appear to be only explicable by the accretion of material onto an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf.|$|E

25|$|Felsic and {{intermediate}} magmas that erupt often do <b>so</b> <b>violently,</b> with explosions {{driven by the}} release of dissolved gases—typically water vapour, but also carbon dioxide. Explosively erupted pyroclastic material is called tephra and includes tuff, agglomerate and ignimbrite. Fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits, which can often cover vast areas.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} Janjaweed entered the conflict, {{the rape of}} women and young girls, often by {{multiple}} militiamen and often throughout entire nights, began to be reported at a staggering rate. Children as young as 2 years old were reported victims, while mothers were assaulted {{in front of their}} children. Young women were attacked <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> that they were unable to walk following the attack.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the king}} {{repeated}} his invitation to Casaubon {{to settle in}} Paris, {{and gave him a}} pension. No more was said about the university. The recent reform of the University of Paris closed its doors to all but Catholics; and though the chairs of the Collège de France were not governed by the statutes of the university, public opinion ran <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> against Protestants, that Henry IV dared not appoint a Calvinist to that position. When the king's sub-librarian Jean Gosselin died of extreme old age in 1604, Casaubon succeeded him, with a salary of 400 livres in addition to his pension.|$|E

25|$|At 1615 hrs Teti {{returned}} to sea and sighted an exhausted {{man in the}} water and covered with fuel oil. Caffery dived into the sea and supported the man, and Tetis crew threw them a lifebuoy on a line. The sea was tossing Teti <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> that her crew could not haul the two men aboard, so she towed them to calmer water inside the mole. Tetis engineer, Fanciulli, tried to haul the men aboard but because of the oil they kept slipping from his grasp. The tug India came to assist. Her Captain, Ragone, passed a rope around the two men, and Teti took the rope and towed the two men ashore.|$|E
500|$|Though not to {{the degree}} applied to Little Nemo, McCay's {{backgrounds}} were heavily detailed, and he drew monotonous, repetitive images with great accuracy; McCay later applied these skills to his animation work. [...] The backgrounds remain the same from panel to panel, while passersby unwittingly pass Sammy during his buildup. [...] During the buildup McCay presents people going about their lives; to comics historian Thierry Smolderen, [...] "The reading of these pages is most enjoyable not in the repetitive buildup of the sneeze itself, but in the beautifully varied and fleshed out description of the human activities that are <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> interrrupted by the explosion." ...|$|E
500|$|In stanza 35 of the Poetic Edda poem Völuspá, a völva tells Odin that, amongst {{many other}} things, she sees Sigyn sitting very unhappily with her bound husband, Loki, under a [...] "grove of hot springs". Sigyn is {{mentioned}} a second (and final) {{time in the}} ending prose section of the poem Lokasenna. In the prose, Loki has been bound by the gods with the guts of his son Nari, his son Váli [...] is described as having {{been turned into a}} wolf, and the goddess Skaði fastens a venomous snake over Loki's face, from which venom drips. Sigyn, again described as Loki's wife, holds a basin under the dripping venom. The basin grows full, and she pulls it away, during which time venom drops on Loki, causing him to writhe <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> that earthquakes occur that shake the entire earth.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, Cesare {{was also}} stricken, and in him the fever raged <b>so</b> fierce and <b>violently</b> {{that he had}} himself {{immersed}} to the neck in a huge jar of ice-cold water--a drastic treatment in consequence of which he came to shed all the skin from his body.|$|R
60|$|They chatted on {{for some}} time, Grace being set quite at her ease by her entertainer. Mrs. Charmond was far too well-practised a woman not to know that to show a marked {{patronage}} to a sensitive young girl who would probably be very quick to discern it, was to demolish her dignity rather than to establish it in that young girl's eyes. <b>So,</b> being <b>violently</b> possessed with her idea of making use of this gentle acquaintance, ready and waiting at her own door, she took great pains to win her confidence at starting.|$|R
60|$|She recoiled in Wright and displeasure {{before a}} wooing <b>so</b> impetuous and <b>violently</b> outspoken; though the displeasure was perhaps but a passing emotion, {{the result of}} early training.

500|$|At 00:40 {{the entire}} convoy and nearby U-boats were jolted {{by a very}} heavy {{explosion}} {{thought to have been}} one of the largest prior to atomic bomb testing. The explosion stopped the engine of the tug Uncas rescuing survivors six miles astern of the convoy. SS Titus was rescuing survivors from Empire Lynx when the explosion lifted her bow <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> the crew believed Titus had been torpedoed. The crew abandoned ship before the master realized Titus was undamaged and reboarded to sail to England with a skeleton crew including some Empire Lynx and Hatimura survivors. Titus was drydocked upon arrival in England, but the only damage found was a small dent in her port side. U-132 is believed to have been destroyed by the explosion. The cause [...] of the explosion is unknown, but it is assumed to have resulted from detonation of the ammunition cargo aboard either Hobbema or Hatimura. In all, 19 Allied ships were sunk from convoy SC 107.|$|E
500|$|Limited in {{exposure}} to eligible men, Sophia {{and several of}} her sisters became involved with courtiers and equerries. Sophia entered into a relationship with her father's chief equerry, Major-General Thomas Garth, a man thirty-three years her senior. He had a large purple birthmark on his face, causing Sophia's sister Mary to refer to him as [...] "the purple light of love" [...] and courtier and diarist Charles Greville to call him a [...] "hideous old devil". Despite this, one lady-in-waiting noted [...] "the princess was <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> {{in love with him}} that everyone saw it. She could not contain herself in his presence." [...] Greville wrote about Sophia and her sisters' affairs in a diary entry, [...] "women fall in love with anything – and opportunity and the accidents of the passions are of more importance than any positive merits of mind or of body... were secluded from the world, mixing with few people – their passions boiling over and ready to {{fall into the hands of}} the first man whom circumstances enabled to get at them." ...|$|E
500|$|McDonnell {{test pilot}} Edwin Schoch was {{assigned}} to the project, riding in the XF-85 while it was stowed aboard the EB-29B, before attempting a [...] "free" [...] flight on 23 August 1948. After Schoch was released from the bomber at a height of 20,000ft (6,000 m), he completed a 10-minute proving flight at speeds between 180 and 250mph (290–400km/h), testing controls and maneuverability. When he attempted a hook-up, it became obvious the Goblin was extremely sensitive to the bomber's turbulence, as well as being affected by the air cushion created by the two aircraft operating in close proximity. [...] Constant but gentle adjustments of throttle and trim were necessary to overcome the cushioning effect. After three attempts to hook onto the trapeze, Schoch miscalculated his approach and struck the trapeze <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> that the canopy was smashed and ripped free and his helmet and mask were torn off. He saved the prototype by making a belly landing on the reinforced skid at the dry lake bed at Muroc. [...] All flight testing was suspended for seven weeks while the XF-85 was repaired and modified. Schoch used the down period to undertake a series of problem-free dummy dockings with a Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star fighter.|$|E

"He had {{no right}} to shut up our gate and forbid our {{crossing}} that little field, and no GENTLEMAN would have DARED to do it after all our kindness to his mother," [...] exclaimed Miss Henny, <b>so</b> suddenly and <b>violently</b> that Rosamond nearly fell off the old lady's lap with the start she gave.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense?" [...] And as {{he spoke}} he {{took her by the}} arm and shook her.

60|$|They snarled for answer, yet {{hung back}} until Colonel Pride's voice shook them into action. In a body they charged him now, <b>so</b> {{suddenly}} and <b>violently</b> {{that he was}} forced to give way. Cunningly did he ply his sword before them, but ineffectually. They had adopted fresh tactics, and engaging his blade they acted cautiously and defensively, advancing steadily, and compelling him to fall back.|$|R
500|$|Sigyn {{appears in}} the books Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál in the Prose Edda. In Gylfaginning, Sigyn is {{introduced}} in chapter 31. There, she is introduced as the wife of Loki, {{and that they have}} a son by the name of [...] "Nari or Narfi". Sigyn is mentioned again in Gylfaginning in chapter 50, where events are described differently than in Lokasenna. Here, the gods have captured Loki and his two sons, who are stated as Váli, described as a son of Loki, and [...] "Nari or Narfi", the latter earlier described as also a son of Sigyn. Váli is changed into a wolf by the gods, and rips apart his brother [...] "Nari or Narfi". The guts of [...] "Nari or Narfi" [...] are then used to tie Loki to three stones, after which the guts turn to iron, and Skaði places a snake above Loki. Sigyn places herself beside him, where she holds out a bowl to catch the dripping venom. However, when the bowl becomes full she leaves to pour out the venom. As a result, Loki is again described as shaking <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> that the planet shakes, and this process repeats until he breaks free, setting Ragnarök into motion.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 November 1914 divers sent to {{find the}} wreck {{reported}} that the ship's port bow as far aft as the sick bay had been blown off by the explosion and lay [...] east of the mooring.

60|$|It fascinated her. There were {{inaccessible}} ledges that haunted {{her with}} their remote fastnesses. How wonderful {{would it be}} to get there, rest there, if that were possible! But only eagles could reach them. There were places, then, that the desecrating hands of man could not touch. The dark caves were mystically potent in their vacant {{staring out at the}} world beneath them. The crumbling crags, the toppling ledges, the leaning rocks all threatened to come thundering down at the breath of wind. How deep and soft the red color in contrast with the green! How splendid the sheer bold uplift of gigantic steps! Carley found herself marveling at the forces that had <b>so</b> rudely, <b>violently,</b> and grandly left this monument to nature.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} village {{dates back}} to 1812 when it obtained its independence from Archidona, protected by Royal Decree from the Courts of Cádiz, and was called Puebla del Saucedo. The inhabitants of Archidona opposed this both bitterly and <b>violently</b> <b>so</b> that eventually the new village had {{to turn to the}} Council of the King's Chambers where the dispute was finally settled in 1827. Three years later the village changed its name to Villanueva del Rosario.|$|R
60|$|Even then I was {{not sure}} of him, for when I got him under one arm he wriggled <b>violently,</b> <b>so</b> that it was {{difficult}} to wade ashore with him. In this difficulty I took him to a place where the shoal {{in the middle of the}} stream was about three inches deep. There I lay down on him, picked up a stone and hammered his head with it, while the purling water rippled pleasantly over my face.|$|R
2500|$|Beethoven was {{attracted}} to {{the ideals of the}} Age of Enlightenment. In 1804, when Napoleon's imperial ambitions became clear, Beethoven took hold of the title page of his Third Symphony and scratched the name Bonaparte out <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> that he made a hole in the paper. He later changed the work's title to [...] "Sinfonia Eroica, composta per festeggiare il sovvenire d'un grand'uom" [...] ("Heroic Symphony, composed to celebrate the memory of a great man"), and he rededicated it to his patron, Prince Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz, at whose palace it was first performed.|$|E
2500|$|The Norse god who {{was most}} popular was Thor, and the Altuna Runestone in Uppland shows Thor's fishing {{expedition}} {{when he tried}} to capture the Midgard Serpent. Two centuries later, the Icelander Snorri Sturluson would write: [...] "The Midgarth Serpent bit at the ox-head and the hook caught in the roof of its mouth. When it felt that, it started <b>so</b> <b>violently</b> that both Thor's fists went smack against the gunwale. Then Thor got angry, assumed all his godly strength, and dug his heels so sturdily that his feet went right through the bottom of the boat and he braced them on the sea bed." [...] (Jansson's translation). The Altuna Runestone has also included the foot that went through the planks.|$|E
2500|$|... "In poetry", writes Robbins, [...] "this post-symbolist {{attempt to}} achieve new forms {{had to break}} decisively with the old unities of time, place and action. Unity of scene did not {{correspond}} {{with the reality of}} modem life; unity of time did not correspond with the culturally known and anticipated effects of change. That is why Mercereau (as Metzinger noted) shifted his scenes <b>so</b> <b>violently,</b> why Barzun tried {{to solve the problem of}} simultaneously developing lines of action by choral chanting. Similarly Gleizes and his painter friends sought to create a vision free from introverted or obscure imagery which could treat collective and simultaneous factors. This necessitated a new kind of allegory opposed to the old meaning which presented one thing as the symbolic equivalent of another. A tentative precedent perhaps existed in Courbet's Real Allegory which, however, might have been considered an allegorical failure by Gleizes and Metzinger because Courbet [...] "did not suspect that the visible world only became the real world by the operation of thought".|$|E
50|$|The IS-4 {{was built}} for {{aerobatics}} with a high structural strength and a very high maximum speed {{which could not be}} achieved in a vertical dive. Due to the pilot's sitting position and the arrangements of the controls, it was difficult for pilots to exceed the 8g loading limit. During high speed flight it was possible for the air-brakes to be sucked out <b>violently,</b> <b>so</b> most pilots ensured that they remained closed by holding the airbrake control.|$|R
60|$|The time kept {{slipping}} along--Hawkins did not return--Sellers {{could not}} venture to wait longer; so he attacked the bottle himself, {{and proceeded to}} note the effects. Hawkins got back at last; took one comprehensive glance at the lecturer, and went down and headed off the procession.
