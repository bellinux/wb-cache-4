2500|$|Another {{difference}} is that more of the photons entering the camera will be detected by the Foveon X3 photosensor than is possible with a mosaic sensor. This is because each of the color filters overlaying each photosite of a mosaic sensor passes {{only one of the}} primary colors, absorbing the other two. The absorption of these colors reduces the total amount of light gathered by the sensor and destroys much of the information about the color of the light impinging on each <b>sensor</b> <b>element.</b> Although the Foveon X3 has greater light gathering ability, the individual layers do not respond as sharply to the respective colours. Thus color-indicating information in the sensor's raw data requires [...] "aggressive" [...] matrixing (essentially, removal of common-mode signals) to produce color data in a standard color space, which can increase color noise in low-light situations.|$|E
50|$|The Samba {{transducer}} comprises a <b>sensor</b> <b>element</b> {{mounted on}} the tip of an optical fiber. The functional principle is that light passes through the fiber and is reflected in a cavity inside the <b>sensor</b> <b>element.</b> The height of the cavity is relative to the external pressure that the <b>sensor</b> <b>element</b> is being exposed to. When the pressure surrounding the <b>sensor</b> <b>element</b> is changing, the reflected light signal will change. The Samba Control Unit receives the reflected light signal and processes it to a readable pressure value.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for sensing a desired {{component of a}} magnetic field using an isotropic magnetoresistive material. This is preferably accomplished by providing a bias field that {{is parallel to the}} desired component of the applied magnetic field. The bias field is applied in a first direction relative to a first set of magnetoresistive <b>sensor</b> <b>elements,</b> and in an opposite direction relative to a second set of magnetoresistive <b>sensor</b> <b>elements.</b> In this configuration, the desired component of the incident magnetic field adds to the bias field incident on the first set of magnetoresistive <b>sensor</b> <b>elements,</b> and subtracts from the bias field incident on the second set of magnetoresistive <b>sensor</b> <b>elements.</b> The magnetic field sensor may then sense the desired component of the incident magnetic field by simply sensing the difference in resistance of the first set of magnetoresistive <b>sensor</b> <b>elements</b> and the second set of magnetoresistive <b>sensor</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R

40|$|A fluid dynamic {{analysis}} was performed to optimise the positioning of <b>sensor</b> <b>elements</b> in a coated quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) based volatile detection system.

In the original sensor chamber, the <b>sensor</b> <b>elements</b> were positioned in a staggered pattern and at 90 ° to the incoming flow. The numerical analysis shows that, {{with the exception of}} the front face of the first sensor, only 45 % of the flow passed over the sensors.

40|$|Overcoming {{the problem}} of {{temperature}} cross sensitivity inherent in optical fibre strain sensors is currently of much interest. Many groups are investigating this cross sensitivity in fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors by seeking ways to have both parameters determined simultaneously from two separate <b>sensor</b> <b>elements</b> having different temperature and strain responsibities. Clearly both parameters can be obtained simultaneously provided the two separate <b>sensor</b> <b>elements</b> have different temperature and strain responsibilities.

40|$|To meet sensing and {{calibration}} needs, an in situ calibration {{technique was}} developed. It {{is based on}} electrolytic generation of a hydrogen/air atmosphere within a hydrogen sensor. The hydrogen is generated from water vapor in the air, and being electrical in nature, the in situ calibration can be performed completely automatically in remote locations. Triply redundant <b>sensor</b> <b>elements</b> are integrated within a single, compact housing, and digital logic provides inter-sensor comparisons to warn of and identify malfunctioning <b>sensor</b> <b>elements.</b> An evaluation of this concept is presented...|$|R
40|$|Application {{specifications}} for the methane sensor were assembled and design guidelines, development goals and evaluation criteria were formulated. This {{was done to}} provide a framework to evaluate sensor performance and any design adjustments to the preprototype sensor that could be required to provide methane sensitivity. Good response to hydrogen was experimentally established for four hydrogen <b>sensor</b> <b>elements</b> to be later evaluated for methane response. Prior results were assembled and analyzed for other prototype hydrogen sensor performance parameters to form a comparison base. The four <b>sensor</b> <b>elements</b> previously shown to have good hydrogen response were experimentally evaluated for methane response in 2. 5 % methane-in-air. No response was obtained {{for any of the}} elements, despite the high methane concentration used (50 % of the Lower Flammability Limit). It was concluded that the preprototype sensing elements were insensitive to methane and were hydrogen specific. Alternative sensor operating conditions and hardware design changes were considered to provide methane sensitivity to the preprototype sensor, including a variety of different methane sensing techniques. Minor changes to the existing <b>sensor</b> <b>elements,</b> <b>sensor</b> geometry and operating conditions will not make the preprototype hydrogen sensor respond to methane. New <b>sensor</b> <b>elements</b> that will provide methane and hydrogen sensitivity require replacement of the existing thermistor type elements. Some hydrogen sensing characteristics of the modified sensor will be compromised (larger in situ calibration gas volume and H 2 nonspecificity). The preprototype hydrogen sensor should be retained for hydrogen monitoring and a separate methane sensor should be developed...|$|R

50|$|For {{sporadic}} measurements {{outside the}} laser system (e.g. during maintenance) a separate measuring unit is beneficial.

50|$|Firmware in the camera, or a {{software}} in a raw converter program such as Adobe Camera Raw, interprets {{the raw data}} from the sensor to obtain a full color image, because the RGB color model requires three intensity values for each pixel: one each for the red, green, and blue (other color models, when used, also require three or more values per pixel).A single <b>sensor</b> <b>element</b> cannot simultaneously record these three intensities, and so a color filter array (CFA) must be used to selectively filter a particular color for each pixel.|$|E
