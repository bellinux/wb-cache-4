40|$|This diploma thesis {{was aimed}} at study {{of the effect of}} various gaseous <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> in an {{environment}} of increased temperature on the paper and its properties. Paper samples were exposed to elevated temperature in air, CO 2 gas and gas mixtures of N 2 :Ar (1 : 1). The impact of conditions on the mechanical, chemical and optical properties of paper has been studied after exposure of the paper by <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> under elevated temperature. The change of properties was determined immediately after exposure of samples under simultaneous conditions of fire, further one was determined for samples exposed to conditions of dry and wet aging. As a reference sample was used crude paper. Values of elasticity modulus, strength tensile, tearing resistance, the work needed for break tension, the total color difference and pH of samples have been determined. The results showed that every external influence causes at least some change in mechanical, optical and chemical properties such as increased temperature, the effect of <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> or ageing of paper. The gas mixture N 2 :Ar (1 : 1) had the smallest influence on the sample paper, which was worked. Thus this gas mixture could be the best choice for the application in archive environments...|$|R

Water mists are very efficient as an <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> if they {{are present in the}} flame. There are, however, several problems associated with introducing the water mist into the flame: the spray reaches only a short distance; small water droplets have a very short lifetime; droplets coagulate into larger droplets; large droplets hit obstacles such as walls and therefore have difficulties in being dispersed throughout the protected volume...|$|R
5000|$|Many free {{standing}} cigarette receptacles utilize an oxygen restricting design that extinguishes still burning butts. These style receptacles are usually made of molded plastic, polyethylene and fiberglass, with metal inner liners and metal pails to gather disposed butts. [...] Due to their oxygen depriving design, no additional <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> is generally required. Cigarette butts are deposited {{through a small}} opening and drop down a long neck into the collection chamber. The collection chamber typically houses the removable pail. Other {{free standing}} receptacles, such as those made of pre-cast concrete and stone aggregate materials, rely on water, sand or gravel placed in the collection bin to assist in extinguishing disposed butts. Butt removal and clean-out is accomplished through a door in the receptacle's base, or, the base and top separate to allow access to disposed butts.|$|R

40|$|Cleanliness is the {{priority}} property {{of an active}} fire-extinguishing agent for protection of expensive electronic equipment and high value materials. Halon 1301 was considered the most suitable clean agent to ensure industrial fire safety because it leaves no residue and allows {{a high level of}} extinction efficiency and human safety, as with many other <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media.</b> However, over 15 years ago, several studies showed that this agent damages the atmospheric ozone layer and causes global warming. As law has ruled out halon agents, a variety of clean fire suppression alternatives has surfaced over the past decade, but none of these has become the 'perfect' halon substitute. In this paper the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach is proposed as a tool to select the best halon alternative for fire protection. A hierarchical structure comprising 19 criteria is reported here to illustrate the performance and characteristics of several halon alternatives in order to define the most suitable agent for different fire risk situations. analytical hierarchy process; AHP; active fire protection; halon alternatives; clean agents; alternatives selection; fire safety; ozone damage; fire risk...|$|R

40|$|The {{dispersed}} phase that accompanies enclosure fires, for example, soot, ash, sprinkler droplets and extinguishing powder, could exert a {{significant influence on}} {{the dynamics of the}} background fluid. In this thesis, the results of a numerical study into the effects of this {{dispersed phase}} on the flow in a fire compartment are presented. A two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics solver, with appropriate approximations for low Mach number flows and mathematical sub-models for two­phase flows, has been developed in order to simulate fire induced convective motions in planar compartments. The description of the dispersed particulate is based on a two­continuum approach, whereby the dispersed phase and the gaseous phase are assumed to be two mutually interacting and penetrating continua. In this thesis, two 'passive' models and an 'active' model of the dispersed phase are considered. In the passive models the particulate acts as a tracer only and has no hydrodynamical influence on the gas phase. The second passive model differs from the first in that the production of gases in the fire compartment, for example arising from combustion or propellant gases due to extinguishment of the fire, is taken into account. This second passive model more accurately predicts the growth of pressure in a sealed fire compartment for weak fires. As the volume fraction of the particulate increases the spatial-temporal hydrodynamic influence exerted on the gaseous flow by the dispersed phase becomes significant and, under certain conditions, a passive representation is insufficient. An active one­temperature and one-velocity model is proposed which is appropriate for the description of a hydrodynamically active particulate with an instantaneous velocity and thermal relaxation time. In this thesis, computational fluid dynamics is used as a tool in order to characterise the applicability of the passive models and the active model. The ability of the passive models to accurately predict the growth of pressure in a compartment for 'surface' fires, for example smouldering combustion and weak fires, is investigated. The active model is used to study the hydrodynamics of powder <b>extinguishing</b> <b>media</b> in a compartment with an open doorway...|$|R
40|$|With highly {{accelerated}} {{developments in}} computing and communications technology, society's overall dependence on this equipment {{is becoming increasingly}} acute. In areas such as critical electronic data processing centres and telecommunication hubs, {{one of the main}} protection objectives is to achieve minimum operational disruption, as downtime resulting from a fire condition could lead to huge financial losses. Minimising negative impact on an organization and the need for a sound basis in the decision making process are the fundamental reasons why companies implement fire risk management for their essential information technology systems. For many years a key element used to protect these critical assets was the installation of a fixed Halon 1301 gas extinguishing system. Often, the mere presence of a computer was sufficient justification to install such a system and little thought was given to any systematic fire risk assessment of the installation. This led to the use of Halon 1301 where other fire extinguishing systems and protection techniques could have been applied with equal effectiveness and at comparable costs. The cessation of production of halon {{as a result of the}} Montreal Protocol gave fresh impetus to the development of <b>suitable</b> alternative fire <b>extinguishing</b> agents. It also offered fire protection engineers an opportunity to re-evaluate existing loss control techniques and to examine alternative fire protection strategies. However, it is argued in this study, that an appropriate level of automatic fire protection can only be determined by the use of a suitable quantitative risk assessment and a number of such methodologies are critically examined. There are a significant number of contributing factors that must be considered when deciding which fire suppression system to select for a new installation or whether to retrofit fire suppression on a legacy platform. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a methodology to quantify any fire suppression technology by its life cycle cost and then to apply informed technical opinion into this system. The results of this assessment procedure offer a number of possible fire engineering solutions including a quite diverse range of automatic fire extinguishing techniques and these are discussed and evaluated in detail. Inevitably, a high proportion of such critical risks will require the installation of an automatic fire suppression system. The main halocarbon and inert replacement extinguishing agents are therefore critically compared and contrasted for their suitability in protecting these facilities. A complete review of these extinguishing agents was conducted which focused on suppression mechanisms; quantification of their performance and qualities; interaction with a fire and potential damage to electrical equipment from the release of a given agent. It is shown that all the post-halon extinguishing agents are deficient in some important areas. Major issues such as the formation of thermal decomposition products, the protection of continuously energized electrical circuits and the adequacy of the specified design and extinguishing concentrations have generally not been adequately addressed. Unfortunately, some of these issues are not even resolved in the current gaseous fire extinguishing standards which offer minimal advice from either a design or installation standpoint. This study demonstrates that existing international design standards are deficient in some fundamental areas and that, in a number of circumstances, systems installed to these standards are inadequate to fully protect the hazard in question. A number of recommendations are presented to address some of these deficiencies. Finally, a semi-quantitative risk assessment methodology for the selection of <b>suitable</b> <b>extinguishing</b> agents is proposed. Initially, this attempts to synthesize the results derived from the critical extinguishing agent review and then applies an application weighting factor based on expert consensus to provide a final score for a particular suppression mechanisms suitability to protect a given application...|$|R
40|$|Water {{has long}} been the agent of choice for {{fighting}} Class' A' fires In fact the thermal characteristics of water make it ideally <b>suitable</b> as an <b>extinguishing</b> agent for most types of fire, whether it is used to extract heat directly from the flames, the hot products of combustion or {{from the surface of the}} fuel The phase change from liquid water to water vapour (steam) is particularly effective in extracting thermal energy and the production of large quantities of water vapour may further contribute to fire extinguishment by inerting the surrounding atmosphere, especially where the fire is confined to some extent The literature review which forms the basis of this report has been conducted in order to establish the current state-of-the-art regarding the use of water sprays for the suppression and extinction of Class' A' fires It is concluded that the current state-of-the-art is close to the point where a description of fire extinction can be given from the initiation of suppression to the point of final extinguishment. this is a stated FRDG objective However. certain gaps in the knowledge base still exist and these are highlighted. provisional recommendations are made for the direction of future research in these areas...|$|R
40|$|CAFS je sustav za gašenje komprimiranom pjenom (Compressed Air Foam System) koji omogućuje aktivno i preventivno gašenje požara, a pogodan je kada požar poprima obilježja nekoliko vrsta požara. Zahvaljujući mogućnosti finoga doziranja vlažnosti pjene, višestruko se povećava učinkovitost samo jednoga spremnika vode na vatrogasnom vozilu. Ova karakteristika dolazi do izražaja poglavito u sredinama s ograničenim količinama vode. Dobro prianjanje na površine svih vrsta čini komprimiranu pjenu izuzetno dobrim sredstvom za gašenje i prevenciju širenja požara klase “A”. Osim za požare klase “A”, komprimirana pjena dobro je sredstvo za gašenje i požara klase “B”. In {{accordance}} with increasing technological innovations in operational work, necessarily comes to changing of operational-tactical procedures {{depending on the}} type of intervention. Main goal is to enable better fire protection by the use of newly developed and available equipment and extinguishing agents. In 2002. the CAFS system for fire compressed foam (Compressed Air Foam System) was introduced in Croatia. The system allows active and preventive fire <b>extinguishing,</b> <b>suitable</b> when a fire takes on the characteristics of several types of fire. Thanks to the fine dosing of humidity foam, increase of efficiency is obtained by the use of only one tank of water on the fire trucks. This characteristic comes to the fore especially in areas with limited amounts of water. Furthermore, the quality of the foam is several times improved compared to the foam obtained in a classical method. Good adhesion to surfaces of all kinds makes compressed foam an extremely good mean of preventing spread of fire class “A “. Compressed foam can also be used as a good extinguishing agent for fire class “B “. There are some limitations with regard to the capacity CAFS is significantly lower compared to the possibilities of classical foam system. However better insight in foam system capabilities offers new operational-tactical procedures for fire extinguishing...|$|R
