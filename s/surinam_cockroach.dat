40|$|Abstract. Oxyspiruriasis {{caused by}} the bird eyeworm, Oxyspirura mansoni, a thelaziid nematode, in three species of pheasants, 3 Chrysolophus pictus (golden pheasant), 7 Lophura nycthemera (silver pheasant) and 9 Phasianus colchicus (common pheasant) in Zoo Negara Malaysia are reported. Birds with the disease were treated with a {{solution}} of 0. 5 % iodine or 0. 5 % lysol. Antistress powder for 4 days in water and non-strep vitamin powder in water was also provided. Control measures included removal of the cockroach intermediate host, Pycnoscelus surinamensis (<b>Surinam</b> <b>cockroach)</b> from {{the vicinity of the}} birds. The golden pheasant is a new host for O. mansoni in peninsular Malaysia. Oxyspiruriasis was first described in peninsular Malaysia in 1939 and later in 1948, but details of disease manifestation or the causative agent was not mentioned (Mustaffa-Babjee. 1968). However, Mustaffa-Babjee (1968) described an outbreak of oxyspiruriasis in domestic fowls in Kual...|$|E
