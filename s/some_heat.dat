25|$|Isothermal {{compression}} and expansion approaches attempt to maintain operating temperature by constant heat exchange to the environment. They are only practical for low power levels, without very effective heat exchangers. The theoretical efficiency of isothermal energy storage approaches 100% for perfect heat {{transfer to the}} environment. In practice neither of these perfect thermodynamic cycles is obtainable, as <b>some</b> <b>heat</b> losses are unavoidable.|$|E

25|$|Even in {{the cold}} soap making process, <b>some</b> <b>heat</b> is usually required; the {{temperature}} is usually raised to a point sufficient to ensure complete melting of the fat being used. The batch may also be kept warm for some time after mixing to ensure the alkali (hydroxide) is completely used up. This soap is safe to use after about 12–48 hours, but is not at its peak quality for use for several weeks.|$|E
25|$|In March 2007, {{the media}} {{reported}} {{a dispute over}} the final cut of the film. Concerned with the length of director Julie Taymor's cut of the film, Revolution Studios chairman Joe Roth tested a sneak preview of a shortened version without first informing Taymor. The incident sparked <b>some</b> <b>heat</b> between the two, later involving Sony Pictures' Amy Pascal urging Taymor {{to agree to the}} shorter version. After several months of dispute, Taymor's version was eventually reinstated as the theatrically released version.|$|E
25|$|In a cyclic {{process in}} which the system does net work on its surroundings, it is {{observed}} to be physically necessary not only that heat be taken into the system, but also, importantly, that <b>some</b> <b>heat</b> leave the system. The difference is the heat converted by the cycle into work. In each repetition of a cyclic process, the net work done by the system, measured in mechanical units, is proportional to the heat consumed, measured in calorimetric units.|$|E

25|$|The {{top deck}} {{on the new}} bridge was {{originally}} just a flat space. Traversing the bridge in the harshness of winter was very uncomfortable, so an enclosure running {{down the center of}} the pedestrian area was added by the 1970s. Originally meant to be a heated indoor pedestrian area, due to energy cost concerns, the walkway is mostly unheated. There are some heaters inside that keep the area slightly warmer than outside, and <b>some</b> <b>heat</b> loss from the steam mains, but it can still dip below the freezing point. The structure also adds a windbreak for the top level, improving conditions for people who choose to walk outside. In the summer, large overhangs also provide some shade.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, Vanity Fair was {{the latest}} {{magazine}} under fire for allegedly altering {{the appearance of a}} celebrity featured in its pages for its February issue. The celebrities under speculation were Lupita Nyong’o, an actress from 12 Years A Slave, who had her photo lightened during publication, and Lena Dunham, an actress from the HBO series Girls. For Lupita’s case, the magazine tweeted the photo and it began with fans accusing the company of altering her complexion. However some believe that the Vanity Fair images are simply a product of bright set lighting, rather than deliberate skin lightening. The magazine still took <b>some</b> <b>heat</b> and guilt from the whole ordeal. Lupita herself was pleased with the work, and saw no harm done to herself or to hold Vanity Fair or the photographer liable of anything. In weeks prior to Lupita's case, Vogue magazine, a partner and buyer of Vanity Fair in 1936, was accused of altering Lena Dunham's photos. Dunham considered the modified photos to be offensive. Jezebel, then offered up $10,000 to see unretouched version of the spread. The proposal was then refused by the actress.|$|E
25|$|An {{electric}} {{underfloor heating}} system has heating cables {{embedded in the}} floor. Current flows through a conductive heating material, supplied either directly from the line voltage (120 or 240 volts) or at low voltage from a transformer. The heated cables warm the flooring by direct conduction and will switch off once it reaches the temperature set by the floor thermostat. A warmer floor surface radiates heat to colder surrounding surfaces (ceiling, walls, furniture.) which absorb heat and reflects all non absorbed heat to yet other still cooler surfaces. The cycle of radiation, absorption and reflection starts slowly and slows down slowly nearing set point temperatures and ceases to take place once equilibrium is reached all-round. A floor thermostat or a room thermostat or combination controls the floor on/off. In the process of radiant heating {{a thin layer of}} air which is in touch with the warmed surfaces also absorbs <b>some</b> <b>heat</b> and this creates a little convection (air circulation). Contrary to believe people are not heated by this warmed circulating air or convection (convection has a cooling effect) but are heated by the direct radiation of the source and reflection of its surrounds.|$|E

[...] In early 1988, Balukas gave in to {{complaints}} from the men upon her entry to a Chicago-based tournament that it wasn't fair she should have the opportunity to play in both divisions when the men only had the opportunity to play in one, and withdrew from the men's side. Balukas states that after she arrived in Chicago [...] "I found out that the first- and second-place winners in the women’s event were going to be invited to play in the men’s event.

Despite efficient insulation, there will inevitably be <b>some</b> <b>heat</b> leakage into the LNG, resulting in vaporisation of the LNG. [...] This boil-off gas acts to keep the LNG cold.

2500|$|In the United States, the allowed {{nighttime}} {{noise level}} was defined in 1974 as [...] "an average 24-hr exposure limit of 55 A-weighted decibels (dBA) {{to protect the}} public from all adverse effects on health and welfare in residential areas (U.S. EPA 1974). This limit is a day–night 24-hr average noise level (LDN), with a 10-dBA penalty applied to nighttime levels between 2200 and 0700 hours to account for sleep disruption and no penalty applied to daytime levels. The 10-dB(A) penalty makes the permitted U.S. nighttime noise level equal to 45 dB(A), which is more than is accepted in some European countries but less than the noise produced by <b>some</b> <b>heat</b> pumps.|$|E

The suppression circuitry may be insufficient to prevent buzzing to be heard on sensitive audio and radio equipment that share the mains supply with the lighting loads. In this case, special considerations must be made to prevent this interference. [...] European dimmers must comply with relevant EMC legislation requirements; this involves suppressing the emissions described above to limits described in EN55104.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{at the end}} of the Diele {{near the}} back of the farmhouse, was the Flett, an open kitchen and dining area that took up the entire width of the house. The open fireplace, about 1.5 metres across, was located in the middle of the Flett and was ringed with fieldstones. It was not like a hearth in other regions. Many types of cooking were not {{possible}} in this environment (*). Pots had to be high enough, in effect cauldrons, and were hung over the fire with pothooks attached to a wooden frame (Rahmen) hanging over the fireplace, often decorated with horses heads. At night an iron grid was pulled over the fire to prevent sparks, a practice known by the English term curfew. Well-to-do families had a candle arch (Schwibbogen) of masonry instead of a wooden frame. Smoke escaped through an opening in the roof on the gable, the Uhlenloch (also Eulenloch, literally: [...] "owl hole"). The open fireplace meant that such buildings were considered as a particular fire risk by early fire insurance firms. The open fire also provided <b>some</b> <b>heat</b> to the stalls and living quarters of the Hallenhaus. In this way, hay stored in the loft could be dried out and protected from vermin by the smoke. When the farmer's family and farm hands gathered for meal times, the best places were between the fireplace and the rooms. Because there was no partition between Diele and loft, winter temperatures in the Flett never rose above 12°C.|$|E
