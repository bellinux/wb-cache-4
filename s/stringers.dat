5|$|Between {{the forward}} and rear {{bulkhead}} was the bomb bay, which was constructed with a double-frame to strengthen it for carrying the bomb load. The {{space between the}} bomb bay and rear bulkhead was used up by Funkgerät radio equipment and contained the dorsal and flexible casemate ventral gunner positions. The rear bulkhead contained a hatch which allowed access {{into the rest of}} the fuselage which was held together by a series of <b>stringers.</b> The wing was a two spar design. The fuselage was formed of <b>stringers</b> to which the fuselage skin was riveted. Internally the frames were fixed only to the <b>stringers,</b> which made for simpler construction at the cost of some rigidity.|$|E
5|$|The Golden Tornado then invaded North Carolina for {{the first}} time and beat the Tar Heels 20–7. Georgia Tech started the game with its second <b>stringers,</b> which seemed to perform sufficiently.|$|E
5|$|A {{combination}} of 14 longitudinal <b>stringers</b> and four main longerons {{attached to the}} frames helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of alclad stressed skinning were attached. The fuselage plating was 24, 20 and 18 gauge in order of thickness towards the tail, while the fin structure was completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23, before being covered in 22 gauge plating.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stringer</b> {{meets with}} his {{political}} connection Senator Clayton [...] "Clay" [...] Davis. <b>Stringer</b> is angry {{that although he}} bribed Davis to assist his property development business, he is still facing bureaucratic obstructions. Davis asks <b>Stringer</b> for more time, and <b>Stringer</b> pressures him for results. Davis urges <b>Stringer</b> to show patience and leave the street mentality behind but <b>Stringer</b> will not be mollified.|$|R

50|$|<b>Stringer</b> {{checks in}} with Andy Krawczyk and learns about a rival {{property}} developer who has garnered much success from an association with Clay Davis. <b>Stringer</b> {{goes back to}} Davis and insists that he move faster in making him money. Davis takes <b>Stringer</b> to meet a contact who arranges federal funding but who refuses to talk to <b>Stringer.</b> Davis reassures <b>Stringer</b> that they will {{do business with the}} contact. <b>Stringer</b> returns to Davis with a briefcase full of cash and looks for assurances that Davis will deliver. Davis calls this a sign that <b>Stringer</b> is still not ready, but takes the money and tells <b>Stringer</b> that everything is a go.|$|R
5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} spar. The trapezoidal ailerons are near the wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and <b>stringers,</b> with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal tailplane {{is attached to the}} load-bearing frame at two mounting points.|$|E
5|$|Early {{aircraft}} {{suffered from}} leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re-sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft {{were found to}} have cracks in outer wing ribs and <b>stringers.</b> There were also problems with aileron control cylinders, electrical connectors, and engine compartment fires. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on 30 October 1965, flying the hazardous post-strike reconnaissance missions. The USAF Thunderbirds used the F-4E from the 1969 season until 1974.|$|E
5|$|The 1866 {{construction}} was considerably stronger, {{compared to the}} two previous spans, due to major renovations. The old cables that snapped {{had been replaced by}} newer, stronger ones. Thomas also gave the span a new deck floor, a bridge railing and new <b>stringers.</b> The bridge was much better cared for this time around, as it also survived a local flood in 1903 and an icestorm in the early months of spring 1904.|$|E
50|$|Bodie reports {{his meeting}} with Major Colvin {{directly}} to <b>Stringer.</b> <b>Stringer</b> first chastises Bodie for going around the proper channels of reaching him, but Bodie says he was worried that only <b>Stringer</b> would consider the proposition. He tells <b>Stringer</b> that he was picked up with other Barksdale lieutenants including Tucky and Little Mikey. <b>Stringer</b> behaves as if Bodie is wearing a wire until he shows him otherwise. Bodie reminds <b>Stringer</b> of his problems with Marlo.|$|R

5000|$|C. Vivian <b>Stringer</b> had {{cultivated}} {{a relationship}} with Harris while <b>Stringer</b> was at Cheyney State. This relationship continued, even after <b>Stringer</b> moved to take the head coaching position in Iowa. A women interviewing for an assistant coaching position told <b>Stringer</b> about a player she {{had seen in the}} Boston area. <b>Stringer</b> had no contact information, and started calling the high school, even thought it was summer, trying to contact her. One day, she reached a janitor. She asked if he knew Edwards and he responded, [...] "Who Ice" [...] Are you kidding me? That girl is the truth." [...] He explained that her coach was Alfreda Harris, so <b>Stringer</b> called Harris. She wasn't sure that Harris would remember her, but she did, and responded, [...] "It's about time, <b>Stringer.</b> She's only the best damn player in America." [...] <b>Stringer</b> began to recruit Edwards. On a recruiting visit, Edwards was embarrassed to admit she didn't know where Iowa was, so <b>Stringer</b> pulled out a map to show her. <b>Stringer</b> convinced her to enroll at Iowa. She was sympathetic, as she had not known where Iowa was, confusing it with Idaho, when <b>Stringer</b> had first been approached for the job.|$|R
5|$|The nave and chancel {{are carried}} on five pairs of piers and the {{interior}} has a boarded wagon roof coloured in blue, crimson and gold which stretches the whole length of the church. At {{the time of the}} construction of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, William Froude – the engineer given responsibility for this section of the line by Isambard Kingdom Brunel – inserted iron <b>stringers</b> to prevent the walls from spreading as a result of vibrations from the trains. A screen runs across the whole width of the church.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the {{wreckage}} revealed that large portions of the wings' skin were badly glued and {{that a number of}} rib caps and <b>stringers</b> were not glued at all. Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the bradawl holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than it needed to be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} week, Florida crushed the {{mismatched}} Sewanee Tigers 71–6 in Jacksonville despite Sewanee's highly publicized aerial attack. Clyde Crabtree and Tommy Owens {{had to sit}} out with injuries. Goof Bowyer, Red Bethea, and Broward McClellan were seen as {{the stars of the}} game. The Gators played substitutes throughout the second half, putting the first <b>stringers</b> back in {{by the middle of the}} fourth quarter. Florida's center, Frank Clark, also drew praise for his play on the line. This score placed the Gators in first place for scoring within the Southern Conference, and still remains one of the seven highest single-game scoring totals in Gators team history.|$|E
50|$|On 19 May 2015, it was {{announced}} <b>Stringer</b> had signed a one-year deal with Sale Sharks. In February 2016, <b>Stringer</b> signed a one-year contract extension with Sale.

5000|$|Avon and <b>Stringer</b> {{meet for}} a late night drink. <b>Stringer</b> apologizes for not dealing with Marlo Stanfield sooner. Avon is nostalgic about the {{shoplifting}} days of their youth, retelling a story of <b>Stringer's</b> failed heist of a badminton set. The story is illuminating to their current situation, as <b>Stringer</b> is driven to play what Avon calls [...] "away games" [...] and leave his gangster past behind. Avon asks <b>Stringer</b> to dream with him and <b>Stringer</b> tells him they don't need to dream because they own so much now, including real estate, that is legal. <b>Stringer</b> tells Avon that he can't drink too much since he is visiting the development site the following day. Avon asks what time <b>Stringer</b> plans {{to meet with the}} property developer (so that he can tell Mouzone where to find him). <b>Stringer</b> is awkward in response and the two men exchange more conversation before embracing in a way that foreshadows each knows that he has betrayed the other.|$|R
5|$|The {{leading edge}} of the wing has a {{honeycomb}} structure panel construction, providing strength with minimal weight; similar panels cover the flap shrouds, elevators, rudders and sections of the fins. The skin panels are integral with the <b>stringers</b> and are fabricated using computer-controlled machining, reducing production time and cost. Combat experience has shown that this type of panel is more resistant to damage. The skin is not load-bearing, so damaged skin sections can be easily replaced in the field, with makeshift materials if necessary. The ailerons are at the far ends of the wings for greater rolling moment and have two distinguishing features: The ailerons are larger than is typical, almost 50 percent of the wingspan, providing improved control even at slow speeds; the aileron is also split, making it a deceleron.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Street Bridge {{opened for}} traffic in 1919, {{but had to}} be closed in 1932 after the {{southeast}} pier was excessively settled. The Connecticut Highway Department and federal government provided the funds required to remove the bascule leaves and replace the pier in 1936. As {{a part of the}} renovations, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the bridge floor was replaced with steel grating atop 14-inch (36-cm) I-beam <b>stringers.</b> In 1984, the eastern approach span and northwest trunnion post, the point where the bridge pivots, were reconstructed as part of what would be the bridge's last major renovations. Other minor repairs to the bridge's steel and masonry were done during the project. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and it was dismantled in 1999. In 2010, the United States Coast Guard struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal. Previously, the rule stated that the bridge need not open for the passage of vessels.|$|E
5|$|The bridge's {{fourteen}} spans extended 1,907feet (580m) long. The {{three main}} spans were of deck truss construction while {{all but two}} of the eleven approach spans were steel multi-girder construction, the two exceptions being concrete slab construction. The piers were not built in the navigation channel; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119m) channel. The two support piers for the main trusses, each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the center main span, were located on opposite banks of the river. The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same main trusses. Each was 266feet (81m) in length, and was connected to the approach spans by a 38foot (11.6m) cantilever. The two main trusses, one on either side, ranged in depth from 60feet (18.3m) above their pier and concrete pylon supports, to 36feet (11m) at midspan on the central span and 30feet (9m) deep at the outer ends of the adjoining spans. At the top of the main trusses were the deck trusses, 12feet (3.6m) in depth and integral with the main trusses. The transverse deck beams, part of the deck truss, rested on top of the main trusses. These deck beams supported longitudinal deck <b>stringers</b> 27inches (69cm) in depth, and reinforced-concrete pavement. The deck was 113ft 4in (34.5m) in breadth and was split longitudinally. It had transverse expansion joints at the centers and ends of each of the three main spans. The roadway deck was approximately 115feet (35m) above the water level.|$|E
50|$|After the meeting, <b>Stringer</b> {{arrives and}} Avon {{explains}} that the new soldiers are from the East side and are working on retainer. <b>Stringer</b> reports the Co-Op's dissatisfaction, but Avon is not interested. <b>Stringer</b> tells him that Proposition Joe has offered to mediate, but Avon is skeptical of his chances. Avon {{is more interested in}} <b>Stringer’s</b> role in the breach of the Sunday truce. <b>Stringer</b> tells him that he had no idea that Omar was with his grandmother or on his way to church. Avon is disappointed in <b>Stringer’s</b> disregard for the truce and the rumors that have started about the incident. <b>Stringer</b> asks about their cessation of business and suggests they move more people into Colvin’s free zones.|$|R

25|$|In {{steel plate}} construction, <b>stringers</b> join {{parallel}} steel plates. The plate assemblies are fabricated off site, and welded together on-site to form steel walls connected by <b>stringers.</b> The walls become the form into which concrete is poured. Steel plate construction speeds reinforced concrete construction by cutting out the time-consuming on-site manual steps of tying rebar and building forms. The method results in excellent strength because the steel {{is on the}} outside, where tensile forces are often greatest.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stringer</b> {{plans to}} {{stabilize}} {{control of the}} Barksdale Organization by sending Avon back to prison for parole violations, betraying the location of his safe-house and armory to Colvin. However, <b>Stringer</b> is simultaneously betrayed by Avon when Brother Mouzone confronts him about <b>Stringer's</b> plot to engineer a conflict between Mouzone and Omar Little. Mouzone tells Avon that he knew <b>Stringer</b> had intentionally fed Omar misinformation, and that he held Avon responsible for <b>Stringer's</b> actions, threatening to use his connections {{to cut off the}} Barksdale organization's connections and supply of drugs from New York. In an effort to avoid a war with Mouzone, Avon reluctantly tells him <b>Stringer's</b> whereabouts.|$|R
50|$|Shamrock was <b>Stringer</b> Bell's main {{assistant}} while Avon Barksdale was in prison. <b>Stringer</b> sounds out {{his loyalty}} by having him followed {{on a trip}} to Philadelphia to collect a package of drugs, along with Bodie Broadus.
