50|$|Margaret Knight {{was born}} on February 14, 1838 in York, Maine to James Knight and Hannah Teal. After her father {{died when she was}} young, Knight's family moved to Manchester, New Hampshire. She {{received}} a basic education, but left school with her siblings to work at a cotton mill. At the age of 12, Knight witnessed an accident at the mill where a worker was stabbed by a steel-tipped shuttle that shot out of a mechanical loom. Within weeks she invented a safety device for the loom that was later adopted by other Manchester mills. The device was never patented and the exact nature of it is unknown, though it may have been either a device to stop the loom when the <b>shuttle</b> <b>thread</b> broke or a guard to physically block a flying shuttle. Health problems precluded Knight from continuing work at the cotton mill and in her teens and early 20s she held several jobs, including home repair, photography and engraving.|$|E

Hand looms were the original weaver's tool, with the <b>shuttle</b> being <b>threaded</b> through alternately raised warps by hand. Inventions during the 18th century spurred the Industrial Revolution, with the [...] "picking stick" [...] and the [...] "flying shuttle" [...] (John Kay, 1733) speeding up production of cloth. The power loom patented by Edmund Cartwright in 1785 allowed sixty picks per minute.|$|R

As a result, a lockstitch can be formed anywhere on the material being sewn; it does not need to be near an edge.|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} control the kinetic {{barriers}} governing the relative motions of the components in mechanically interlocked molecules is important for future applications of these compounds in molecular electronic devices. In this Full Paper, we demonstrate that bipyridinium (BIPY^(2 +)) dications fulfill the role as effective electrostatic barriers for controlling the <b>shuttling</b> and <b>threading</b> behavior for rotaxanes and pseudorotaxanes in aqueous environments. A degenerate [2]rotaxane, composed of two 1, 5 -dioxynaphthalene (DNP) units flanking a central BIPY^(2 +) unit in the dumbbell component and encircled by the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT^(4 +)) tetracationic cyclophane, has been synthesized employing a threading-followed-by-stoppering approach. Variable-temperature ^(1) H  NMR spectroscopy reveals that the barrier to shuttling of the CBPQT^(4 +) ring over the central BIPY 2 + unit is in excess of 17  kcal[*]mol^(− 1) at 343  K. Further information {{about the nature of}} the BIPY^(2 +) unit as an electrostatic barrier was gleaned from related supramolecular systems, utilizing two threads composed of either two DNP units flanking a central BIPY^(2 +) moiety or a central DNP unit flanked by a BIPY 2 + moiety. The threading and dethreading processes of the CBPQT^(4 +) ring with these compounds, which were investigated by spectrophotometric techniques, reveal that the BIPY^(2 +) unit is responsible for affecting both the thermodynamics and kinetics of pseudorotaxane formation by means of an intramolecular self-folding (through donor–acceptor interactions with the DNP unit), in addition to Coulombic repulsion. In particular, the free energy barrier to threading (Δequation image) of the CBPQT^(4 +) for the case of the thread composed of a DNP flanked by two BIPY^(2 +) units was found to be as high as 21. 7  kcal[*]mol^(− 1) at room temperature. These results demonstrate that we can effectively employ the BIPY^(2 +) unit to serve as electrostatic barriers in water in order to gain control over the motions of the CBPQT^(4 +) ring in both mechanically interlocked and supramolecular systems...|$|R
40|$|Nanoscience and {{nanotechnology}} are new {{fields of}} science and technology that deal with the study and control of matter on the nanometre range. One of their main challenges is the manipulation of single atoms and molecules to build up devices and machines of nanometre size that could accomplish tasks with effects visible in a macroscopic scale. Devices and machines of nanometre size are, in principle, defined by analogy with their macroscopic counterparts. A ‘molecular device’ is an assembly of a discrete number of molecular components designed to achieve a specific function and a ‘molecular machine’ is a particular type of molecular device, in which the component parts can display changes in their relative positions as result of some external stimuli to perform a net task. In this thesis we studied some examples of synthetic molecules that seem suitable candidates for developing molecular devices, specifically rotaxanes and a dithienylethene-based switch. Rotaxanes are molecular shuttles composed of one or more macrocyclic structures locked onto a linear thread by bulky stoppers placed at both ends. The macrocyclic structure can <b>shuttle</b> along the <b>thread,</b> allowing a translational or positional isomerism, which infers the switching of macroscopic material properties through controlled motion (shuttling) at the molecular level. On the other hand, dithienylethene-based molecules can exist in two stable configurations, the so-called open and closed forms that have very different electronic properties, and it is possible to switch between them by irradiation with light of a particular wavelength. These examples have been extensively studied in solution. However, for most foreseeable nanotechnological applications they have to be integrated in the solid state, to be used as building blocks for the preparation of functional and addressable materials. The approach followed in this thesis is to immobilize them on a surface and study them in the form of monolayers or thin films. ...|$|R
