40|$|Abstract: Although {{the number}} of older people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) has {{increased}} substantially, few {{studies have focused on}} older PLWHA in developing countries. Based on a sample of 866 rural PLWHA in Henan, Anhui and Yunnan provinces in China, this study compares the characteristics of PLWHA aged 50 or older (n= 185) with younger PLWHA (n= 681). Most of the older PLWHA were female (n= 112), illiterate, married and at the clinical stage of HIV. Over 90 % of older people with HIV/AIDS lived in Henan and Anhui provinces. The severe epidemic in Henan and Anhui provinces was caused by commercial blood and plasma donation. Older PLWHA were less educated, received less social support and were more likely to live alone than younger PLWHA. The results underline the importance of developing programs and policy initiatives targeted at older people infected with HIV/AIDS. The policy and program recommendations include using a gender sensitive strategy, designing <b>specific</b> <b>AIDS</b> education and prevention programs suitable for low-literacy older adults and social support interventions for older PLWHA...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{laboratory}} tests {{are available to}} assist in the diagnosis of alcohol consumption and related disorders. The levels of intake at which laboratory results become abnormal vary from person to person. Laboratory tests are particularly useful in settings where cooperativeness is suspected or when a history is not available. Several biochemical and hematological tests, such as γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity, highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) content of serum, and erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are established markers of alcohol intake. Their validity as markers is based largely on correlations with recent intake at a single time point and on decreases in elevated values when heavy drinkers abstain from alcohol. These readily available laboratory tests provide important prognostic information and should be integral part of the assessment of persons with hazardous alcohol consumption. There are several other markers with considerable potential for more accurate reflection of recent alcohol intake. These include carbohydrate deficient transferrin, β-hexosaminidase, acetaldehyde adducts and the urinary ratio of serotonin metabolites, 5 -hydroxytryptophol and 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid. These markers provide hope for more sensitive and <b>specific</b> <b>aids</b> to diagnosis and improved monitoring for intake...|$|E

To monitor and analyze changes in mortality over time, we have explored this issue within the EuroSIDA study and propose a standardized protocol unifying data collected and allowing for classification of all deaths as AIDS or non-AIDS related, including events with missing cause of death.

40|$|The newly defined {{syndrome}} AIDS includes 25 unrelated parasitic, neoplastic, and noninfectious indicator diseases. Based on epidemiological correlations, {{the syndrome}} {{is thought to}} be due to a new, sexually or parenterally transmitted retrovirus termed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The following epidemiological data conflict with this hypothesis. (i) Noncorrelations exist between HIV and AIDS; for example, the AIDS risks of infected subjects vary greater than 10 -fold with their gender or country. Abnormal health risks that are never controlled as independent AIDS causes by AIDS statistics, such as drug addiction and hemophilia, correlate directly with an abnormal incidence of AIDS diseases. Above all, the AIDS diseases occur in all risk groups in the absence of HIV. (ii) American AIDS is incompatible with infectious disease, because it is almost exclusively restricted to males (91 %), because if it occurs, then only on average 10 years after transfusion of HIV, because <b>specific</b> <b>AIDS</b> diseases are not transmissible among different risk groups, and because unlike a new infectious disease, AIDS has not spread exponentially since the AIDS test was established and AIDS received its current definition in 1987. (iii) Epidemiological evidence indicates that HIV is a long-established, perinatally transmitted retrovirus. HIV acts as a marker for American AIDS risks, because it is rare and not transmissible by horizontal contacts other than frequent transfusions, intravenous drugs, and repeated or promiscuous sex. It is concluded that American AIDS is not infectious, and suggested that unidentified, mostly noninfectious pathogens cause AIDS...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 This study {{evaluates the}} effect of an Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) {{prevention}} program on the incidence of gonorrhea among the enlisted men in the 105 th Battalion of the Honduran Army. The education program was initiated {{as a result of}} the high incidence of AIDS in Honduras (more than half of all of the known cases of AIDS in Central America are in Honduras). The AIDS prevention program for this battalion was initiated in July, 1989 and consists of lectures, videos, and printed materials concerning the nature of HIV/AIDS. The program emphasized the use of condoms as a means of avoiding infection: thus the incidence of gonorrhea would also be expected to decrease {{as a result of the}} program. The program is presented to new recruits as a portion of their three month basic training in first aid and personal health. Although the AIDS education program provided to the recruits entering the 105 th Battalion is similar to that given to recruits entering other battalions, in only the 105 th is the program continued after graduation from basic training, where quarterly refresher courses are given throughout the enlisted men's service career. This retrospective observational study compares the prevalence of gonorrhea among the 105 th and three other military units that did not receive ongoing AIDS educational program. The prevalence of gonorrhea was used as an indicator of the effectiveness of the program because its prime route of infection (intimate sexual contact) is the same as HIV, and because gonorrhea is easily detected. The study covered the period between January 1990 and December 1993. The data in the study were provided by the Honduran Army and consists of summaries of the results of periodic inspections conducted by military physicians on all enlisted men at approximately 6 week intervals. In these inspections, the enlisted men are medically examined for the presence of signs of gonorrhea. The data include the date of the inspection, the number of soldiers examined, and the number cases of gonorrhea detected. In the Honduran Army, the incidence of gonorrhea has declined significantly in the last four years. It is speculated that at least three contributing factors are responsible: the free distribution of condoms; the increasing awareness and fear of AIDS; and, the <b>specific</b> <b>AIDS</b> education campaigns presented to the enlisted men. The results of this study indicate that significant reductions in the prevalence of gonorrhea occurred in all military units studied and that the rate of reduction in the unit that received the ongoing educational campaign was greater than in the units that did not receive the educational campaign. The study indicates that the provision of ongoing AIDS education to the Honduran enlisted soldiers results in a decrease in the prevalence of gonorrhea. The study also demonstrated the feasibility of conducting research on sexually transmitted diseases in military units...|$|E
40|$|Title of the thesis: Specifics of {{the nursing}} care of {{patients}} with MRSA {{in the operating room}} from an anesthesiology nurse perspective. The aim of this thesis was to identify the specifics of nursing care of a patient with the MRSA in the operating room from the perspective of nurses working in the operating room. In the theoretical part focus is given to nursing care and its specifics for a patient with MRSA. Chapters relating to the regime measures, barrier nursing procedures and the use of <b>specific</b> <b>aids,</b> instruments and tools are treated in detail. The nursing care provided by anesthesia nurses and perioperative nurses in the operating room is defined. To reach the goals the quantitative research through questionnaires was chosen. The research sample consisted of anesthesia nurses and perioperative care nurses. Two types of standardized questionnaires were used, consisted of closed questions where respondents chose an appropriate answer, and from semi-open questions where respondents could specify their answers, and in one case open questions. Both questionnaires were completed by 12 test questions, where respondents had the choice of three possible answers, where one answer was correct. The results of the investigation are summarized in two types of graphs. Bar charts were used in questions where more answers were possible to mark, and for a better clarity the results were supplemented by tables. Results to other questions, where options were limited by one answer, are shown in percentages in pie graphs. Our thesis is very narrowly focused, because we concentrated on specifics of nursing care in a patient with MRSA in the operating room. We have determined the specifics of barrier nursing, nursing problems in a patient with MRSA in the operating room. We have discovered barrier nursing procedures in a patient with MRSA in the operating room. We have also succeeded in assessing the knowledge of nurses working in the operating room. The goal was met. An interesting finding was that most of anesthetic nurses and perioperative nurses had responded that the structural and technical arrangement in the operating room was not satisfactory in terms of barrier nursing of a patient with MRSA. This problem was expected, owing to the author´s experience in operating theaters. Thus Hypothesis 1 is confirmed. In total five hypotheses were stated, four of which were confirmed and one was disproved. The aim of the thesis was to draw attention to problems in the operating room during nursing a patient with MRSA. In the course of the research work there were no problems, however, it is necessary to mention the lack of literature on MRSA with regard to nursing care in operating theaters. The theoretical section of this thesis could be recommended as a resource for the education plan created on the basis of information collected and the results of this research. The results of the research survey may serve for general public, anesthesia and perioperative nurses who could benefit from the educational plan in practice while providing nursing care for a patient with MRSA...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac {{surgeries}} {{are very}} serious surgical procedures with considerable specific features. This bachelor thesis focuses on oxygen therapy from the viewpoints of nurses and patients. Its theoretical part describes physiology of breathing and the oxygen therapy as such. It describes individual sources of oxygen and indications for oxygen administration. It also describes principles to be observed during oxygen administration. <b>Specific</b> <b>aids</b> are used for oxygen administration, particularly oxygen masks or oxygen goggles. Quality pulmonary rehabilitation is also necessary to make oxygen therapy more effective. Pulmonary rehabilitation is particularly important for patients after a cardiac surgery {{and it should be}} practiced even before the surgery. This approach is critical because in the post-surgery period the therapy makes it possible for the patient to breathe and to expectorate properly. Pulmonary rehabilitation is practiced with patients by general nurses at the cardio surgery ward, as well as by physiotherapists. There are various techniques available to determine efficiency of oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation. The techniques may be classified as invasive and non-invasive; the most frequently used non-invasive method is pulse oxymetry and the most frequently used invasive technique is blood collection for ABR. Two objectives were set for the thesis. The first objective was to map knowledge of nurses about how to provide care to patients treated with oxygen therapy. The second objective was to determine how the patients feel after a cardiac surgery. Two hypotheses and two research questions were formulated. The first hypotheses were: Nurses working at the resuscitation care station have more knowledge about oxygen therapy than nurses working at the intermediate care station. The second hypothesis was: Nurses working at the resuscitation care station have more knowledge about pulmonary rehabilitation than nurses working at the intermediate care station. The first research question was: How do the patients feel during oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation? The second research question was: How are the patients after a cardiac surgery informed about oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation? In the research part of the bachelor thesis I have used both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Quantitative processing of data was used for questionnaires filled out by nurses working in the hospitals Nemocnice České Budějovice a. s., Nemocnice na Homolce in Prague and in the faculty hospital Královské Vinohrady in Prague. The method was used for evaluation and assessment of knowledge of nurses working at the resuscitation and intermediate care wards. Quantitative methods were used for processing of data obtained through semi-structured interviews with patients after a cardiac surgery. The data were transcribed and coded using a pencil and paper method. The data were categorized based on the identified codes. Two categories were created: oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation. Each of the categories was further divided into three sub-categories. Two categories were created for the research oxygen therapy and pulmonary therapy. Three sub-categories were subsequently created for the oxygen therapy and the pulmonary therapy. The quantitative research has shown that the knowledge of nurses about oxygen therapy is higher among the nurses working at the resuscitation care ward. However, the situation is different in case of their knowledge about pulmonary rehabilitation. In this case the knowledge of nurses working at the intermediate care ward was higher. The processed data from the qualitative research have shown that patients do have sufficient information about post-surgery oxygen therapy, as well as about pulmonary rehabilitation. For all patients in the post-surgery period after a cardiac surgery the frequency of pulmonary rehabilitation was higher than 1 per day...|$|E

40|$|Promotion of {{self-sufficiency}} {{in patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis in selected daily activities at the home environment The topic of my bachelor thesis is promotion of self-sufficiency {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease the main symptom of which is damage of mainly small joints, muscles, ligaments, {{but it may also}} manifest itself in internal organs of the body. This leads to significant motion limitation and thus greatly deteriorates the quality of life and self-sufficiency of affected people. Since it is women who suffer from this disease most, we concentrated on the area of cooking, eating and personal hygiene. The role of nurses is to lead patients to self-sufficiency. There are more possibilities how to provide the patients with limited self-sufficiency with support, but the thesis is focused on the aids to promote self-sufficiency in cooking, eating and personal hygiene. To carry out the research survey we stated six goals. The first goal was to find out what aids to promote self-sufficiency the patients with rheumatoid arthritis have at their disposition for cooking food and eating. The second objective was to determine what aids to promote self-sufficiency the patients with rheumatoid arthritis have at their disposition in the area of personal hygiene. The third objective was to determine what aids to promote self-sufficiency the patients with rheumatoid arthritis miss in the area of cooking and eating. The fourth goal was to find out what aids to promote self-sufficiency the patients with rheumatoid arthritis miss in the area of personal hygiene. The fifth objective was to create a brochure to promote self-sufficiency of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in cooking, eating and personal hygiene. The sixth goal was to apply the booklet on patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The goals of the thesis were met. At the turn of February and March 2011 the qualitative research survey was conducted. For data collection the method of questioning, the non-standardized interview technique was used. Using pre-prepared questions we interviewed the respondents with rheumatoid arthritis who are treated on an outpatient basis. Based on information and available aids mapping, a booklet to promote self-sufficiency in patients with rheumatoid arthritis was created and subsequently tested. The research group consisted of six respondents suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. The respondents were selected according to predetermined criteria, which were the suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, disease stages II., III., IV, when self-sufficiency is strongly influenced and monocyclic, polycyclic and progressive course of rheumatoid arthritis is present. The research sample for an inquiry was selected by the same criteria, and it consisted of 10 respondents. The thesis revealed which <b>specific</b> <b>aids</b> are available to patients with rheumatoid arthritis and which are missing. Based on obtained information and the aids mapped, a booklet to promote self-sufficiency of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the area of cooking, eating and personal hygiene was created. We believe that steps to improve self-sufficiency in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the areas of cooking, eating and personal hygiene at home environment involve the booklet provision to outpatient and inpatient departments of rheumatology. To address the widest possible population of rheumatics with damaged self-sufficiency and on the basis of positive responses to the booklet, we accepted the offer to publish a series article about promotion of self-sufficiency in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the magazine ?REVMATIK?. In our opinion, positive contribution could also be organization of an information seminar on aids to promote self-sufficiency for patients and nurses in rheumatology units and for members of the Rheumatism - league and students of ZSF...|$|E
