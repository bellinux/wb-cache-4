5|$|The Alter Real is a <b>strain</b> of the Lusitano {{which is}} bred {{only at the}} Alter Real State Stud in Portugal. The stud was founded in 1748 by the Portuguese royal family to provide horses for the {{national}} riding academy and royal use. The Portuguese School of Equestrian Art (Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre) uses these horses exclusively in their performances. The <b>strain</b> was developed from 300 Iberian mares imported from Spain in 1747. When Napoleon invaded Spain in the early 19th century, the Alter Real <b>strain</b> deteriorated due {{to the introduction of}} Arabian, Thoroughbred, Spanish-Norman and Hanoverian blood. However, in the 19th and 20th centuries the <b>strain</b> was re-established with the further introduction of Spanish blood. In the early 20th century, with the 1910 revolution that ended the monarchy, the Alter Real <b>strain</b> faced extinction, as records were burned, stallions were gelded and the stud discontinued. Ruy d'Andrade, a specialist in Iberian horse breeds, saved two stallions and several mares, and was able to re-establish the <b>strain,</b> turning his herd over to the Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture in 1942, when the stud was reopened. The Portuguese state has maintained ownership of the stud, and continues to produce horses for use in high school dressage.|$|E
