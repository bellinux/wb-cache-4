5000|$|The term g-force is {{technically}} incorrect {{as it is}} a measure of acceleration, not force. While acceleration is a vector quantity, g-force accelerations ("g-forces" [...] for short) are often expressed as a scalar, with positive g-forces pointing downward (indicating upward acceleration), and negative g-forces pointing upward. Thus, a g-force is a vector acceleration. It is an acceleration that must be produced by a mechanical force, and cannot be produced <b>by</b> simple <b>gravitation.</b> Objects acted upon only <b>by</b> <b>gravitation,</b> experience (or [...] "feel") no g-force, and are weightless.|$|R

50|$|The {{momentum}} compaction or momentum compaction {{factor is}} a measure for the momentum dependence of the recirculation path length for an object that is bound in cyclic motion (closed orbit). It {{is used in the}} calculation of particle paths in circular particle accelerators (like synchrotrons), and for astronomical objects that are bound <b>by</b> <b>gravitation.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1883 {{the first}} of several red brick water towers were built to supply the growing town with water. Water was pumped out of the river and into the top of the tower by a {{wood-fired}} steam engine, and then flowed <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> to surrounding businesses and private residences. Many of these towers can still be seen around town.|$|R
50|$|A {{star system}} or stellar {{system is a}} small number of stars that orbit each other, bound by {{gravitational}} attraction. A large number of stars bound <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> is generally called a star cluster or galaxy, although, broadly speaking, they are also star systems. Star systems are {{not to be confused with}} planetary systems, which include planets and similar bodies.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive's {{cylinders}} were mounted {{outside the}} frame and were lubricated <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> from two tallow cups, attached to the smokebox sides immediately above the steam chests. The feedwater pumps, attached {{to the back of}} the spectacle plate, were operated from the piston crossheads. The locomotive used wooden brake blocks which were driver-operated by a hand brake in the cab.|$|R
6000|$|Is it {{not also}} strange {{that in a}} {{treatise}} entering into so high mathematical analysis as that from which I quote, the false word 'swing,' expressing the action of a body liable to continuous arrest <b>by</b> <b>gravitation,</b> should be employed to signify the oscillation, wholly unaffected by gravity, of substance in which the motion once originated, may cease only with {{the essence of the}} body? ...|$|R
40|$|Rabbits {{were exposed}} to single maximum endurable {{stresses}} of cranio-caudal direction, hypokinesia for periods of one to eight weeks, and hypokinesia followed <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> stresses. The stresses caused dilatation of vessels, greater sinuosity, and occasional ruptures of the walls and extravasation. The greater part of the capillaries were dilated; the greatest part constricted. In hypokinesia there was an increasing atrophy of the testes. Significant results are reported...|$|R
5000|$|Approximately 20 {{platform}} {{cars were}} [...] "brought onto the road," [...] which operated <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> {{in one direction}} and by horse-power in the other. The ascent between the canal and the quarries was about 400 ft. The loaded trains moved downwards, [...] "checked in their movements only by the brakes," [...] and were drawn back by horses which were carried along on the train for use on the return trip.|$|R

5000|$|There is a {{somewhat}} well described {{example of a}} topopolis in the novel Matter by Iain M. Banks. This particular topopolis looped its system star many times in various braidings, housing trillions of sapient residents. The topopolis was so massive that stray gases from the system collected within the major spacing within the braids <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> alone, producing a slight atmosphere between the strands, described by the author as a [...] "haze".|$|R
25|$|In general relativity, this {{remaining}} precession, {{or change}} of {{orientation of the}} orbital ellipse within its orbital plane, is explained <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> being mediated <b>by</b> the curvature of spacetime. Einstein showed that general relativity agrees closely with the observed amount of perihelion shift. This was a powerful factor motivating the adoption of general relativity. Recently, Friedman and Steiner obtained the observed perihelion shift and explained its origin without curving spacetime using the relativistic Newtonian dynamics model.|$|R
60|$|Oak was an {{intensely}} humane man: indeed, his humanity often tore in pieces any politic intentions of his which bordered on strategy, {{and carried him}} on as <b>by</b> <b>gravitation.</b> A shadow in his life had always been that his flock ended in mutton--that a day came and found every shepherd an arrant traitor to his defenseless sheep. His first feeling now was one of pity for the untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn lambs.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a series of tests of {{agreement}} between three types of N-body simulations: PM, P 3 M, and Tree codes. We find good agreement in both the individual and the statistical properties only on scales larger than the mean interparticle separation. As a result, we question most numerical results at and below below galaxy scales, either concerning primordial dark matter or baryonic matter coupled to it <b>by</b> <b>gravitation.</b> Subject headings: cosmology:miscellaneous–gravitation–hydrodynamics– methods: numerical–dark matter 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a scalar-tensor theory of gravitation with the scalar source being the {{trace of the}} stress-energy tensor of the scalar field itself and matter.

[...] In service a typical speed of 30 mph was attained; return to Kingstown was <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> down the gradient, and slower. By March 1844, 35 train movements operated daily, and 4,500 passengers a week travelled on the line, mostly simply for the novelty.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} global behaviour of viscous compressible flows with spherical symmetry driven <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> and {{an outer}} pressure, outside a hard core. For a general state function p=p(ρ), we present global-in-time bounds for solutions with arbitrarily large data. For non-decreasing p, the ω-limit {{set for the}} density ρ is studied. For increasing p, uniqueness and static stability of the stationary solutions (including variational aspects) are investigated. Moreover, stabilization rate bounds toward the statically stable solutions are given and their nonlinear dynamical stability is shown...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} irrigating <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> on yields of bean var. ICA-Palmar, applied during {{different}} growth stages,was studied. A randomized block design was used with 7 replications and 7 treatments {{in an area}} of 1. 5 ha with furrows at 0. 60 m (240, 000 plants/ha). The system of irrigating <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> using gated pipes was utilized. Agronomic practices were done for pest and disease control. Rainfall during the crop cycle modified the treatment. Treatments II, V, and VI used a water depth of 262, 275, and 287 mm and yielded 1874, 1872, and 1831 kg/ha, resp. Treatments I and III used 239 and 231 mm and produced 1652 and 1520 kg/ha, resp. The control only yielded 689 kg/ha and received only 175 mm with irrigation at germination and rainfall during the crop cycle. It was concluded that: (1) Five waterings supplying an usable water depth of 270 mm (an applied water depth of approx. 350 mm) gave the highest bean yield. (2) Irrigation at germination up to a depth of 30 cm allows the crop to develop until 20 days after planting. (3) During flowering (28 - 30 days) and fructification (48 - 50 days) soil moisture tension should not be higher than 35 centibars. (CIAT...|$|R

50|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} governing the universe as a whole are derived from general relativity with a small, positive cosmological constant. The solution is an expanding universe; due to this expansion, the radiation and matter in the universe cool down and become diluted. At first, the expansion is slowed down <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> attracting the radiation and matter in the universe. However, as these become diluted, the cosmological constant becomes more dominant {{and the expansion of}} the universe starts to accelerate rather than decelerate. In our universe this happened billions of years ago.|$|R

40|$|We {{reconsider the}} old, mysterious {{relation}} between the mass of pion, the fundamental constants and the Hubble parameter. Firstly, we show how, by introducing the energy density of the Universe; the old rude approximation transforms into an excelant one. After that, we have argued how the new relation can be justified assuming that quantum vacuum is dominated by a gas of virtual pions which have zero gravitational mass, at a very low temperature caused <b>by</b> <b>gravitation.</b> Identification of such a gas of virtual pions with dark energy, leads to a surprisingly good numerical result for the energy density of the vacuum...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} a kinematical analogue of superluminal {{travel in the}} ``warped'' space-times curved <b>by</b> <b>gravitation,</b> {{in the form of}} ``super-phononic'' travel in the effective space-times of perfect nonrelativistic fluids. These warp-field space-times are most easily generated by considering a solid object that is placed as an obstruction in an otherwise uniform flow. No violation of any condition on the positivity of energy is necessary, because the effective curved space-times for the phonons are ruled by the Euler and continuity equations, and not by the Einstein field equations.

40|$|The {{localization}} {{length for}} the center of mass motion of a matter lump, induced <b>by</b> <b>gravitation,</b> is obtained, without using any phenomenological constants. Its dependence from mass and volume is consistent both with unitary evolution of microscopic particles and with the classical behavior of macroscopic bodies required to account for wave function collapse in quantum measurements, the transition between the two regimes being rather sharp. The gravitational interaction of nonrelativistic matter is modelled by a Yukawa Hamiltonian with vanishing pion mass, no gravitational background is needed and the only hypothesis consists in assuming unentanglement between matter and the Yukawa field.
