2500|$|Traditional weapons – spear, bow and war-club The {{traditional}} {{arms and}} equipment {{of the tropical}} kingdoms of West, Central and South-Central Africa consisted of the standard cutting, thrusting and smashing weapons. Spears were less strong than those evolved later in southern Africa under the Zulu, and doubled as throwing and thrusting implements. The bow and arrow found wide use, with relatively weak bow strength being offset {{by the use of}} poisoned arrows in many areas. Use of bowmen to defend fortifications was significant, and peoples like the Yoruba sometimes used crossbows for this purpose. Bow strength is reported by many observers as averaging only approximately 40 pounds at full draw, although simple one-piece bows with some of the largest draw-weights in the world are reported from Kenya – 130lbs compared to 80lbs for a typical medieval European longbow. The use of poisoned arrows from the West African plant, <b>Strophantus</b> hispidus and other sources however, helped rectify the shortcoming in the weaker African bows, and bowmen were skilled at delivering a large volume of shafts. Among tribes such as the Marka poisoned arrows were about 1ft long, tipped with iron and poison, and unfeathered. Archers generally carried quivers filled with 40–50 arrows each. Volume could be heavy, with some men firing two arrows at a time. Volume made up for the lack of accuracy with the unfeathered arrows. Resupply arrangements were not well articulated and an archer exhausting his quiver generally withdrew from the field. Although cavalry was known, it was minor among African forces of the Guinea- Gambia regions who used both the maritime and the infantry tradition, conducting raids on land and water. [...] Archery was important and fighting men of some Sierra Leone tribes carried so many poisoned arrows that they needed two quivers. These archers repulsed English sea rover John Hawkins in 1568, who tried to kidnap Africans from the coast, as well as Portuguese sea intruders before Hawkins. A heavy throwing club was also used in some areas, with sufficient power to break bones on contact. Some of these clubs had sharp animal and fish teeth embedded. Such was their speed and accuracy that African fighters in the 1650s wiped out an attacking Portuguese force with them.|$|E
50|$|The {{first use}} of cannons as siege machine at the siege of Sijilmasa in 1274, {{according}} to 14th-century historian Ibn Khaldun.The Sahelian military consisted of cavalry and infantry. Cavalry consisted of shielded, mounted soldiers. Body armor was chain mail or heavy quilted cotton. Helmets were made of leather, elephant, or hippo hide. Imported horses were shielded. Horse armor consisted of quilted cotton packed with kapok fiber and copper face plate. The stirrups {{could be used as}} weapon to disembowel enemy infantry or mounted soldiers at close range. Weapons included the sword, lance, battle-axe, and broad-bladed spear. The infantry were armed with bow and iron tipped arrows. Iron tips were usually laced with poison, from the West African plant <b>Strophantus</b> hispidus. Quivers of 40-50 arrows would be carried into battle. Later, muskets were introduced.|$|E

40|$|The {{diversity}} {{and distribution of}} climbing plants were investigated in two 1 -ha plots in the KNUST botanic garden. Each plot was divided into sixteen 25 x 25 m quadrats and all trees and shrubs ≥ 10 cm dbh were enumerated in each quadrat. All vines on tree species were identified and counted while all lianas ≥ 1. 5 cm were enumerated. The mechanisms of climbing of the climbers were studied. A total of 951 climbing plants belonging to 82 species, 49 genera and 26 families were identified. These consisted of 72 liana and 10 vine species. Seven hundred and sixteen trees belonging to 77 species and 27 families hosted the climbers. Climbing plants made up of about 43 % of all the species (except herbs) identified. Lianas alone constituted about 38 % of the woody species. The commonest and most dominant species were <b>Strophantus</b> barteri Franch., Smilax species and Griffonia simplicifolia (Vahl ex DC.) Baillon. Most of the climber species showed clumped distribution. Stem twinning was the most predominant climbing mechanism. The number of climbers using the different climbing mechanisms differed significantly (p< 0. 001). Host species, habitat and their interaction had significant (p< 0. 001) effects on climber density...|$|E
