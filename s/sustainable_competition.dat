40|$|Regulation in its generic sense {{has existed}} {{for a very long}} time in {{different}} forms, with different aims and different problems of accountability, but the study of competition regulation by a Government agency has perhaps become fashionable only in recent years. This thesis consists of two leading themes. First, it will contend that, whilst the market system has been seriously underestimated as a social institution to the extent that it should be left to operate and organise itself where that is possible, it is at the same time not always self-regulating. Residual intervention by the State or its agencies will remain necessary in strategic cases, either to protect individual autonomy and choice, or to correct failures of the market system. The question is simply more or less regulation. Secondly, and on that premise, competition regulation must be distinguished into economic regulation and antitrust regulation because the relationship between them is inversely proportional: the more intense economic regulation is, the less important antitrust regulation becomes. By implication then, economic liberalisation or deregulation must be accompanied by a robust framework of antitrust regulation to ensure that the conditions of <b>sustainable</b> <b>competition</b> are not threatened by anti-competitive practices. Conditions of <b>sustainable</b> <b>competition</b> are thus critical for market contestability. For many years, domestic and international airline competition has been the subject of comprehensive regulation. With the passage of time, however, the thinking has changed and, no doubt, liberal policies and practices will continue to find expression in future political and economic sentiments. The responsibility for regulating airlines in the United Kingdom falls on the Civil Aviation Authority, which has played a formidable role in transforming the policy of heavy regulation into minimal regulation, although much of that regulatory landscape has now been altered with the advent of the Single European Aviation Market. The experiences of, both, the CAA and the new SEATNI provide an illuminating account of the evolutionary process of regulating airline competition, that from economic to antitrust regulation...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} {{the extent to which}} {{telecommunications}} consumers decide to switch and why. Results from surveys of consumer switching behaviour in a number of countries are examined to ascertain reasons for actual consumer decision making regarding switching. Implications for telecommunications regulation are considered. In essence, regulation should require that communications service providers ensure that switching is fast, cheap, predictable and reliable and that consumers are able to switch with minimum difficulty and delay. The ability and willingness to switch from one to another supplier of telecommunications and internet services are an important aspect in manifesting consumer empowerment. In turn, empowered consumers are important for <b>sustainable</b> <b>competition.</b> If consumers are inert and passive, suppliers will not be under pressure to deliver the potential benefits of competition. And it is empowered assertive consumers, able and willing to switch, who will exert pressure on suppliers to deliver these benefits. Thus, in making well-informed choices between suppliers, consumers not only benefit from competition but also initiate and sustain it. Insights from behavioural economics are incorporated in the analysis...|$|E

40|$|The {{liberalization}} of the EC telecommunications market has, from the beginning, {{been based on}} a dual-regime of sector-specific regulation and competition law. One of the areas where the interrelation between these two sets of rules is most obvious is that of access to telecommunications networks. The material in this thesis is up to date as of the 31 st July, 2004. This thesis examines the Essential Facilities Doctrine (EFD) as the competition law principle which deals with access of new market entrants to established facilities and, {{in the case of}} telecommunications, networks. This examination leads to the conclusion that if there is an EFD in EC law, it should be applied with extreme caution. The thesis then examines the New Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications, with a particular emphasis on the framework for access and interconnection, and concludes that EC competition law has acquired a prevailing role in the context of regulation of telecommunications. The reform of regulation of electronic communications that is so profoundly inspired by competition law principles, marks a previously unattained level of mutual interaction between regulation and EC antitrust law. Concerning the viability of this dual regime of competition law and regulation, the thesis comes to the conclusion that before <b>sustainable</b> <b>competition</b> has been established, a certain degree of sector-specific regulation has to be upheld. Phasing-out sector-specific regulation too early by relying solely on competition law would create considerable risks for both new entrants and incumbent operators...|$|E

The concept of nanotechnology has overwhelmed almost all forms of lives and has traded its applications in myriad fields. Despite rapid expansion of nanotechnology, <b>sustainable</b> <b>competitions</b> still do exist {{in the field of}} agriculture. In current scenario, agriculture is a manifestation demand to provide adequate nutrition for relentless growing global population. It is estimated that nearly one-third of the global crop production is destroyed annually. The loss owes to various stresses such as pest infestation, microbial pathogens, weeds, natural calamities, lack of soil fertility and much more. In order to overcome these limitations, various technological strategies are implemented but a majority of these have their own repercussions. Hence there is a scrawling progress on the evaluation of nanoparticles into agriculture sector which can reform the modern agricultural system. Applications of these nanomaterials can add tremendous value in the current scenario of a global food scarcity. Nanotechnology can address the adverse effects posed by the abundant use of chemical agrochemicals which are reported to cause biomagnification in an ecosystem. Based on these facts and consideration, present review envisages on nanoparticles as nanoherbicides, nanopesticides, onsite detection agro-pathogens and nanoparticles in post harvest management.

Tourist tends to experience authentically offer, typical for the country that he visits. In that sense, tourist offer adjustment to national identity (based on historic ambience for which the offer is created) presents <b>sustainable</b> <b>competition</b> strategy. Therefore, tourist offer on the Croatian market must include eco tourism, excursion, culture tourism and adventure tourism (with special reference to nautical tourism). Demands for ecological areas and personal safety are criteria that contribute to the choice of tourist destinations. Also the trend of health care is quite obvious (wellness, fitness etc.). In accordance to changed needs of modern tourist, tourist offer must be diversified. It could be done by applying the specialized form of tourist offer. Accordingly, we have used the market research “what tourist thinks” in order to define the appropriate marketing frame by which Croatia will be positioned as specialized tourist destination in a long term. The identity will be based on authentic tourist product. Also, it would provide the credibility of the new national tourist offer. Tourist will be offered to be the explorer of the historical and cultural heritage as well as the identity of the destination he is visiting.

Emotional intelligence (EQ) and entrepreneur cultural was associated with entrepreneurs. Among the success factors of entrepreneurs is to have a high level of emotional intelligence (EQ). Apart from having a high level of education, having a high level of emotional intelligence (EQ) can also help a person become more successful as an entrepreneur to compare with other entrepreneurs who have low emotional intelligence (EQ) as both should be balanced. With a high emotional intelligence (EQ), an entrepreneur can manage the business more orderly and disciplined. This will create a positive entrepreneurial culture. They can also adapt them in whatever situation to continue to manage the business and solve the problem in the best way. Entrepreneur culture is about behaviors and activities in managing the entrepreneur business. Those activities will later determine the success of failure rate of the entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs should strive to improve their emotional intelligence (EQ) and discipline to succeed in any field of work, especially when facing the situations that require competence to decide the best option. Hence, emotional intelligence (EQ) affects the way entrepreneurs run their business.
