Conventional pickup sensors, however, lose sensitivity at lower frequencies. Giant magneto resistive materials offer a unique alternative for very low frequency electromagnetic NDE due to their high sensitivity to low frequency fields, small size, ease of use, and low cost. This paper outlines the development and testing of a Very Low Frequency Self-Nulling Probe incorporating a GMR sensor.

However Janussen, Steiner and Zhu (2002) denied that chancellorids were sponges on the grounds that: chancellorids' hollow sclerites, probably made of aragonite, were quite different from the solid, silica-based spines of demosponges; sponges have <b>simple</b> <b>skins</b> that are only one cell thick, while chancellorids' thicker, more complex skins resemble those of more complex animals.

The paper will explain the design rationale of key examples; describing the structural forms, methods of analysis and design, and the detailing, materials, and methods of fabrication. The largest and most complex of these structures to date is a demountable stage set structure for the Cirque du Soleil “Toruk: First Flight” show, comprising two 15 metre high and 20 metre wide structures. The stage set structures form ‘trees’ on which acrobats climb and perform. Each structure incorporates a high level access gantry with acrobat suspension and counterweight systems, as well as a secondary inflatable <b>skin</b> <b>cladding.</b> The entire primary structure and cladding system is constructed from inflated fabric elements using internal pressures ranging from 0. 5 KN/m 2 up to 90 KN/m 2, and are deflated down to less than 5 % of their erected volume for transport between venues. Other examples of our work described will include temporary pavilions with clear spans of up to 25 metres, using a combination of air tight and air permeable elements. Also a range of wide span structures that we describe as “semi-permanent” that are capable of resisting full environmental wind and snow loading, and that are fully demountable but that can also be erected for extended periods of time in a single location...|$|R

In this paper we introduce the inclusion of two channels in the VA architecture proposed by Itti et al [8] to account for motion and conscious search in a scene. Increasing the channels in the architecture requires an efficient way of combining the various maps that are produced.

The second type which is Generalized Demodex mange is a more severe form of the sickness. The symptoms are more severe and include loss of hair throughout the entire body and the skin may also be scabby and bloody. Generalized are usually hereditary due to immunodeficiency genes that are passed on from Sire and Dam to their puppies. A <b>simple</b> <b>skin</b> scraping test will allow the vet to diagnose demodex mange. The most widely used method to treat Demodex Mange is ivermectin injections or oral medications.
