5|$|Norfolk {{was burned}} down during the Revolutionary War. After the Revolution, Norfolk was rebuilt in the Federal style, based on Roman ideals. Federal-style homes kept Georgian symmetry, {{though they had}} more refined decorations to look like New World homes. Federal homes had {{features}} such as narrow <b>sidelights</b> with an embracing fanlight around the doorway, giant porticoes, gable or flat roofs, and projecting bays on exterior walls. Rooms were oval, elliptical or octagonal. Few of these federal rowhouses remain standing today. A majority of buildings were made of wood and had a simple construction.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival {{house with}} a gable roof and clapboarded exterior.

In 1975, the area surrounding the property has undergone significant change, but the house is surrounded by trees and shrubs and a wrought iron fence that helps set it apart from the neighborhood.|$|E

25|$|The Copeland House was {{designed}} around 1873 {{by an unknown}} architect and cast in the Italianate style. Wright's 1909 remodel work included exterior and interior alterations. A new tile roof was added above the decorative brick work; the roof was removed in the 1950s because of its maintenance expenses. The work fused Wright's Prairie style with the traditional Italiante style through the building's exterior lines. The new low-pitched hip roof that Wright designed, along with the wrap-around porch and overhanging eaves are all elements found in the Copeland House {{which can be found}} on other Prairie style homes Wright designed. The remodeling work also replaced the original doors with doors, frame, <b>sidelights</b> and a transom window all of Wright's own design.|$|E
25|$|As {{the column}} passed the {{municipal}} swimming pool, a particularly dark {{part of the}} street (since a street lamp had failed), it was hit from behind by a bus belonging to the Chatham & District Traction Company. The bus was allegedly travelling at 15–20 miles per hour, although Carter and another witness estimated its speed as 40–45 miles per hour. The bus driver, John William George Samson, 57, {{had worked for the}} company for forty years, twenty-five of them as a driver. He was very familiar with the route. He had his <b>sidelights</b> on, but not his headlights; this was perfectly legal and considered to be normal practice at the time. Other bus drivers said that they were using headlights that night and in that location as it was particularly dark. Other drivers defended Samson's decision not to use his headlights.|$|E

40|$|Lighting {{accounts}} for approximately 54 % {{of the annual}} energy consumption of office buildings, and can effectively be reduced through daylighting. The simplest way to provide day lighting into a typical office space has been to use unilateral <b>sidelighting.</b> Discomfort and visibility glare from unilateral <b>sidelighting</b> cause the occupant to close drapes or blinds and turn on luminaries, resulting in an inefficient use of daylighting. One daylighting concept that has been developed to alleviate this problem is the light plenum. A light plenum can be added economically to an office space by using a hung ceiling simultaneously as a return air and light plenum. The appropriate opaque ceiling panels could be replaced with transparent ones to get the light {{to the rear of}} the space. The question is how much light can be expected to be transferred {{to the rear of the}} room and how different plenum opening configurations would affect those light levels. The result simply that a hung ceiling light plenum can provide adequate light to the rear of the room to balance the high brightness ratios created by unilateral <b>sidelighting.</b> Also, certain plenum opening configurations are more advantageous for certain sky conditions and orientations, and there are some which are of no benefit...|$|R

The experience gained through broadcasting these Games {{would prove to}} be extremely helpful for its parent company Doordarshan, as they broadcast the 2004 Olympic Games live and [...] will also be telecasting the 2010 Commonwealth Games. However, the schedule of the Games clashed with an ongoing Triangular Cricket Tournament, and the events were aired on DD Metro. Doordarshan deployed 350 personnel, 10 outdoor broadcasting vans and 86 cameras for obtaining coverage of the Games. Additionally, five cameras were used for the Sports news and the <b>sidelights.</b>|$|E

50|$|Skylights {{are widely}} used in {{designing}} daylighting for residential, public, and commercial buildings. Increased daylighting can result in less electrical lighting use and smaller sized window glazing (<b>sidelighting),</b> saving energy, lowering costs, and reducing environmental impacts. Daylighting can cut lighting energy use in some buildings by up to 80%.|$|R
