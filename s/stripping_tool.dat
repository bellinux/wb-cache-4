40|$|Draglines {{have been}} abundantly used in coal mining for decades, either as {{stripper}} or stripper and coal extractor. As this equipment possesses certain inherent advantages, which their rivals do not, {{they must be}} operated in a round-the-clock fashion for high productivity and low costs. In India, the development of giant surface mining ventures like Bina and Jayant with setting up of higher coal production targets (upto 10 million tonnes per annum) calls for systems to remove large volume of overburden in shortest possible time. This has resulted in major changes in overburden/interburden excavation technology in surface coal mines from shovel mining to that of draglines. Coal India Limited (CIL) has now standardized the draglines in two sizes, which are 10 / 70 and 24 / 96 for their mines. Most mines depend on the dragline 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Cables or connectors which are 50 ohms or which significantly deviate from 75 ohms will result in signal reflections which will lower {{the performance of the}} connection, possibly to the point of not working. GR-139-CORE, Generic Requirements for Central Office Coaxial Cable, defines type 734 and 735 cables for this application. Due to losses, there are differing distance limitations for each type of cable. Type 734 has a larger center conductor and insulator for lower losses for a given distance. The BNC connectors are also very important as are the crimping and cable <b>stripping</b> <b>tools</b> used to install them. Trompeter, Cannon, Amphenol, Kings, and Canare make some of the true 75 ohm connectors known to work.

40|$|A simple {{simulator}} {{was developed}} to test whether airborne laser scanning {{can be used as}} a <b>strip</b> sampling <b>tool</b> for forest inventory purposes. The simulator is based on the existing two stages, grid based laser inventory procedure. A population of trees was created using an existing forest stand structure generator. Each tree was represented by means of its 3 D-crown model derived from airborne laser scanning measurements and field measured parameters, i. e. total tree height, height of crown base and average crown diameter. Monte Carlo simulations were run to assess the efficiency of volume estimates obtained from airborne laser scanning and ground based inventory. The lowest RMSE for the laser based estimates was 5. 1 m 3 ha- 1 (2. 0 %) and the highest was 8. 4 m 3 ha- 1 (3. 3 %), while RMSE for the ground based estimates varied between 13. 7 m 3 ha- 1 (5. 4 %) and 18. 4 m 3 ha- 1 (7. 2 %). The LIDAR based estimation was on average 6. 3 times more efficient in terms of MSE than ground based sampling. The RMSE of the volume estimates increased with increasing plot size, for a given sampling intensity. The results indicated that forest surveys over large areas carried out using airborne laser scanning as a <b>strip</b> sampling <b>tool</b> can provide accurate estimates, and can be more effective than traditional systematic ground plot based inventories. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} novel skull-stripping {{algorithm}} {{based on a}} hybrid approach that combines watershed algorithms and deformable surface models. Our method {{takes advantage of the}} robustness of the former as well as the surface information available to the latter. The algorithm first localizes a single white matter voxel in a T 1 -weighted MRI image, and uses it to create a global minimum in the white matter before applying a watershed algorithm with a pre-flooding height [18]. The watershed algorithm builds an initial estimate of the brain volume based on the three dimensional connectivity of the white matter. This first step is robust, and performs well in the presence of intensity non-uniformities and noise, but may erode parts of the cortex that abut bright non-brain structures such as the eye sockets, or may remove parts of the cerebellum. In order to correct these inaccuracies, a surface deformation process [6],[33] fits a smooth surface to the masked volume, allowing the incorporation of geometric constraints into the skull-stripping procedure. A statistical atlas, generated from a set of accurately segmented brains, is used to validate and potentially correct the segmentation, and the MRI intensity values are locally re-estimated at the boundary of the brain. Finally a high-resolution surface deformation is performed that accurately matches the outer boundary of the brain, resulting in a robust and automated procedure. Studies by our and other groups outperform other publicly available skull <b>stripping</b> <b>tools...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the tribology during plane strain compression of aluminium <b>strip</b> using steel <b>tools</b> is described. A formulated lubricant containing ester, and hexadecane containing 0, 0. 05 and 0. 5 % stearic acid, are used as lubricants. The friction factor is measured {{for a wide variety}} of process conditions and correlated with surface analysis techniques including ToF-SIMS (time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy). The roughness of the tool is clearly seen imprinted on the strip, indicating that any hydrodynamic or hydrostatic film separating the <b>tool</b> and <b>strip</b> is very small. With clean <b>tools</b> and longitudinal <b>strip</b> roughness, the friction stress equals the shear yield stress of the metal. For transverse strip roughness, hydrodynamic or hydrostatic effects lead to a reduced friction factor. With these cleaned tools there is no effect of additive concentration. After a small number of indents a transfer film builds up on the tool, leading to a fall in friction factor. The strip takes on a smeared appearance with black lines running in the direction of relative slip between <b>strip</b> and <b>tool.</b> This transfer layer is of a 'low friction slurry' type, which is easily wiped-off using tissue paper. The effectiveness of this transfer layer in reducing friction increases with increasing indentation speed and additive concentration.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{describes}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} tribology during plane strain compression testing (PSCT) of aluminium <b>strip</b> with steel <b>tools.</b> lubricated by mineral base oils containing either stearic acid or aluminium stearate as additive in concentrations up to 0. 5 %. The present study is a follow-up {{to the work of}} Sutcliffe et al. [Boundary lubrication of aluminium strip during plane strain compression, Wear 254 (2003) 65 - 79]. The close conformance of the <b>strip</b> and <b>tool</b> indicate that boundary lubrication should {{play a significant role in}} the tribology. The new work supports the conclusions of the previous study, that for the first indent hydrodynamic influences are important, while additives do not affect friction. After a number of indentations a transfer layer builds up on the tool. Depending on the additive concentration and tool roughness, this may either lead to a rise or fall in friction factor. Scanning electron microscope and optical observations show how the transfer layer can either form a smooth mottled appearance which is easily removed using tissue paper for higher additive concentrations, or takes the form of strongly attached particles for lower additive concentrations or in the absence of additives. Similar behaviour is observed for the two types of additive. indicating that the stearate chain in the soap is able to react with the Fe-based tool as effectively as when it is part of the acid-and probably also with the Al strip...|$|R
30|$|The {{comparison}} between measured and predicted forces {{mentioned in the}} previous paragraph {{should be seen as}} a validation of the model used to calculate forces for various rake angles. Although shearing is inevitably a 3 D operation, 2 D approximations are applied in FE simulations due to shorter computation times and better availability of adaptive remeshing techniques to overcome element distortion. When shearing wide <b>strips</b> using <b>tools</b> with zero rake angle, a plane strain approximation is convenient and shows good agreement with experiments, as demonstrated by Gustafsson et al. (2014). These authors hence showed that a 2 D plain strain approximation is applicable to shearing with parallel tools. According to Oldenburg (1980), additional strains and distortions are, however, introduced with inclined tools, and thus, the validity of a plane strain assumption is not obvious in this situation. This study suggests that a 2 D plane strain assumption is appropriate also for shearing with inclined tools, as it is when using a tool with zero rake angle.|$|R
