40|$|This essay {{examines}} the semantics and pragmatics {{of a handful}} of potential <b>slurring</b> terms identifying many of their uses in extant texts in order to assess <b>slurring</b> and non-slurring instances. Also examined are benchmarks for politeness that feed into so-called ‘political correctness’ and attitudes to what language expressions and behaviour are socially acceptable. People who find completely unacceptable those language expressions which are often employed as <b>slurs</b> or insults will regard reports of <b>slurs</b> as themselves <b>slurring.</b> The evidence, however, shows that, divorced from context, language expressions themselves do not <b>slur,</b> though they may be used in order to disparage, besmirch, insult, etc. – i. e., <b>slur.</b> It is a speaker/writer’s perlocutionary intention to <b>slur</b> which is truly reprehensible. Reports of <b>slurs</b> in themselves therefore do not <b>slur</b> unless the reporter subscribes to the intention to slur; a reporter who does not subscribe to the <b>slur</b> needs to somehow make clear their attitude...|$|R

40|$|I {{argue that}} the offense {{generation}} pattern of <b>slurring</b> terms parallels that of impoliteness be-haviors, and is best explained by appeal to similar purely pragmatic mechanisms. In choosing to use a <b>slurring</b> term rather than its neutral counterpart, the speaker signals that she endorses the term (and its associations). Such an endorsement warrants offense, and consequently <b>slurs</b> generate offense whenever a speaker’s use demonstrates a contrastive preference for the <b>slurring</b> term. Since this explanation comes at low theoretical cost and imposes few constraints on {{an account of the}} semantics of <b>slurs,</b> this suggests that we should not require semantic accounts to provide an independent explanation of the offense profile. Whenwe use <b>slurs,</b> we communicate information about ourselves and our attitudes towards the targets. Recognizing this obvious fact requires no great insight, but taking it seriously yields a simple and remarkably powerful explanation of how and why <b>slurs</b> generate offense. Recent discussion of <b>slurs</b> has centered on their offense-generation pattern, characterized by phenomena that cluster into roughly five properties: ⋄ Offensive Autonomy – <b>slurs</b> are offensive even when the speaker does not intend the use to be derogatory. 1 ⋄ Embedding Failure – the offensiveness of <b>slurs</b> projects out of various forms of embedding, including indirect reports, negations, and mentions. ...|$|R

5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, <b>slurred</b> speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E

Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, <b>slurred</b> speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} an original account of <b>slurs</b> {{and how they}} may be differentially used by in-group and out-group speakers. <b>Slurs</b> are first distinguished from other terms and their role in social interaction is discussed. A new distinction is introduced between three different uses of <b>slurs</b> : the paradigmatic derogatory use, non-paradigmatic derogatory use, and non-paradigmatic non-derogatory use. I then account for their literal meaning and explain how a family-resemblance conception of category membership can clarify {{our understanding of the}} various natural-language uses of <b>slurs,</b> -. The focus is restricted primarily to race-based and sex-based <b>slurs</b> used in the context of English speakers, and the article concludes with desiderata to be met by any subsequent analyses of <b>slur...</b>|$|R
5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., <b>slurred</b> speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E
5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, <b>slurred</b> speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Arsenic poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E

40|$|Are racial <b>slurs</b> always {{offensive}} and are racial stereotypes always negative? How, if at all, are racial <b>slurs</b> and stereotypes different and unequal {{for members of}} different races? Questions like these and others about <b>slurs</b> and stereotypes have {{been the focus of}} much research and hot debate lately, and in a recent article Embrick and Henricks aimed to address some of the aforementioned questions by investigating the use of racial <b>slurs</b> and stereotypes in the workplace. Embrick and Henricks drew upon the empirical data they collected at a baked goods company in the southwestern United States to argue that racial <b>slurs</b> and stereotypes function as symbolic resources that exclude minorities but not whites from opportunities or resources and that racial <b>slurs</b> and stereotypes are necessarily considered as negative or derogatory irrespective of their particular context of use. They thus proposed an account of <b>slurs</b> and stereotypes that supports the context-insensitive position of Fitten and Hedger yet challenges the context-sensitive position of Kennedy and Croom. In this article I explicate the account of racial <b>slurs</b> and stereotypes provided by Embrick and Henricks, outline 8 of their main claims, and then critically evaluate these claims by drawing upon recent empirical evidence on racial <b>slurs</b> and stereotypes to point out both strengths and weaknesses of their analysis. Implications of the present analysis for future work on <b>slurs</b> and stereotypes will also be discusse...|$|R

40|$|In {{several recent}} {{contributions}} to the growing literature on <b>slurs,</b> Hedger draws upon Kaplan’s distinction between descriptive and expressive content to argue that <b>slurs</b> are expressions with purely expressive content. The distinction between descriptive and expressive content and the view that <b>slurs</b> are expressions with purely expressive content has been widely acknowledged in prior work, and Hedger aims to contribute to this tradition of scholarship by offering novel arguments {{in support of his}} ‘‘pure expressivist’’ account of <b>slurs.</b> But the account that PE offers is explanatorily inadequate, resting on suspect a priori intuitions which also commit one to denying many basic facts about <b>slurs,</b> such as that <b>slurs</b> largely display systematic differential application and that <b>slurs</b> can be used non-offensively between in-group speakers. In this article I provide clear reasons for rejecting PE, arguing particularly against Hedger as one of PE’s most explicit and recent proponents. In showing that PE is inadequate in at least 11 ways, I argue in favor of a mixed or hybrid approac...|$|R

40|$|<b>Slurs</b> are {{typically}} defined as conveying contempt based on group-membership. However, here I {{argue that they}} are not a unitary group. First, I describe two dimensions of variation among derogatives: how targets are identified, and how offensive the term is. This supports the typical definition of <b>slurs</b> as opposed to other derogatives. I then highlight problems with this definition, mainly caused by variable offence across <b>slur</b> words. In the process I discuss how major theories of <b>slurs</b> can account for variable offence, and conclude that contempt based on group-membership doesn’t cover all the data. I finish by noting that the most offensive <b>slurs</b> are those that target oppressed groups. I claim it is oppression that underpins most offence, and that beyond this offensive property, some <b>slurs</b> are actively used to oppress...|$|R
40|$|<b>Slurs</b> possess {{interesting}} linguistic {{properties and}} so have recently {{attracted the attention of}} linguists and philosophers of language. For instance the racial <b>slur</b> "nigger" is explosively derogatory, enough so that just hearing it mentioned can leave one feeling as if they have been made complicit in a morally atrocious act [...] Indeed, the very taboo nature of these words makes discussion of them typically prohibited or frowned upon. Although {{it is true that the}} utterance of <b>slurs</b> is illegitimate and derogatory in most contexts, sufficient evidence suggests that <b>slurs</b> are not always or exclusively used to derogate. In fact, <b>slurs</b> are frequently picked up and appropriated by the very in-group members that the <b>slur</b> was originally intended to target. This might be done, for instance, as a means for like speakers to strengthen in-group solidarity. So an investigation into the meaning and use of <b>slurs</b> can give us crucial insight into how words can be used with such derogatory impact, and how they can be turned around and appropriated as vehicles of rapport in certain contexts among in-group speakers. In this essay I will argue that <b>slurs</b> are best characterized as being of a mixed descriptive/expressive type. Next, I will review the most influential accounts of <b>slurs</b> offered thus far, explain their shortcomings, then provide a new analysis of <b>slurs</b> and explain in what ways it is superior to others. Finally, I suggest that a family-resemblance conception of category membership can help us achieve a clearer understanding of the various ways in which <b>slurs,</b> for better or worse, are actually put to use in natural language discours...|$|R
