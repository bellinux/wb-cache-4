40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} results are {{reported for the}} dispersion relations found for electromagnetic wave propagation along a coaxial line partially filled with an annular plasma column. Using the slow wave approximation it had been predicted by Napoli and Swartz and Pinder and Foulds that such a structure should support a backward wave and that this backward wave would be virtually unaffected if the inner conductor is withdrawn. The exact analysis which is here reported shows that whilst the backward wave is present without the inner conductor {{it is no longer}} present when the inner conductor is inserted. The absence of the backward wave in the coaxial line was also shown by the experiment that was performed. The experiment was performed with a novel <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> <b>detector</b> which was developed for this purpose. For the theoretical aspect of this work a technique for solving certain types of differential equations was developed. The theory when applied to a multi-layered model of a plasma also failed to show the presence of the backward wave for the coaxial line arrangement...|$|E

40|$|We examine some of {{the roots}} of parity {{violation}} for gravitons and uncover a closely related new effect: correlations between right and left handed gravitons. Such correlators have spin 4 if they involve gravitons moving along the same direction, and spin zero for gravitons moving with opposite directions. In the first case, the most immediate implication would be a degree of linear polarization for the tensor vacuum fluctuations, which could be seen by gravity <b>wave</b> <b>detectors</b> sensitive enough to probe the primordial background, its degree of polarization and anisotropies. Looking at the anisotropy of the gravity waves linear polarization we identify the parity respecting and violating components of the effect. The imprint on the CMB temperature and polarization would be more elusive, since it averages to zero in the two-point functions, appearing only in their cosmic variance or in fourth order correlators. In contrast, spin zero correlations would {{have an effect on}} the two point function of the CMB temperature and polarization, enhancing the $BB$ component if they were anti-correlations. Such correlations represent an amplitude for the production of <b>standing</b> <b>waves,</b> as first envisaged by Grishchuk, and could also leave an interesting signature for gravity <b>wave</b> <b>detectors.</b> Comment: v 2 matches accepted version on Phys.

The phase noise of a MOS SWO with the tapered line is 5 – 10 dB less than that of a uniform-line MOS SWO over a wide range of offset frequencies, centered about 15 GHz.

The new forms of <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> have amplitudes with local maxima at the resonating harmonics, unlike the classical (Stokes) <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> which {{is dominated by the}} fundamental harmonic. The stability of the new <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> is investigated for small to moderate wave energies by numerical computation of their evolution, starting from the <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> solution whose only initial disturbance is the numerical error.

The cyclic recurrence is similar to that observed in the well known linear instability and sideband modulation of Stokes progressive waves, and is also similar to that resulting from the evolution of the new <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> in which the first and ninth harmonics are dominant.

40|$|Vibration {{modes of}} a unite-length Timoshenko beam are studied as <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> using the wave-train closure principle, {{in order to}} obtain a {{complete}} picture of various vibration modes in a beam and to understand the mechanism of their formulations. In particular, the existence of degenerate modes in a beam is investigated. Firstly, it is shown that the two degenerate flexural waves accommodated by an infinite Timoshenko beam are derived from the in-phase'and the out-of-phase relations between transverse vibrations due to bending and shear deformations, respectively. A wave representation of beam vibration is thus developed. Secondly, wave reflection behavior at an elastically supported boundary is analyzed. It is shown that while these two waves are degenerate in an infinite beam, they have to be superposed at the boundary in general, but remain degenerate for certain special boundary conditions. Based on these results, the expression of wave-train closure principle for a finite-length Timoshenko beam is derived, and used to study different <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> in a beam. It is shown that three types of <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> (vibration modes) exist in Timoshenko beams, namely, superposed, degenerate, and single. A condition of space synchronization must be satisfied for superposed <b>standing</b> <b>waves.</b> For the other two types of <b>standing</b> <b>waves,</b> this condition is satisfied naturally.
