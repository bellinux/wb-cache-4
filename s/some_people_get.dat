500|$|Following the complaints, Fox removed {{any mention}} of Catholicism from the scene, {{resulting}} in the line [...] "The church..." [...] Scully was reportedly furious with Fox's actions. In an interview in Los Angeles Times, Scully said, [...] "people can say hurtful things {{to each other about}} their weight, their race, their intelligence, their sexual preference, and that all seems up for grabs, but when you get into religion, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>get</b> very nervous." [...] Marisa Guthrie of Boston Herald also criticized the network, describing it as [...] "caving in" [...] to the Catholic League's protests. She wrote, [...] "Hollywood has always been gun shy of controversy, but recent displays of self-censorship on the part of entertainment industry executives make us cringe [...] Granted Catholics, as a group have endured an ample amount of bashing, but The Simpsons is an equal opportunity offender." [...] Howard Rosenberg, a writer for Los Angeles Times, criticized Fox's actions as well. He argued that the network had a biased opinion towards Catholicism and that, had the scene mentioned a different religion, it would have been accepted. He also wrote, [...] "Given its famous flaunting of sleaze and death-defying motorcycle leaps, the big news here is that Fox has standards. Its latest production is Censors Who Kill Jokes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr. George Kikano, [...] "division {{chief of}} family {{medicine}} at UH Case Medical Center in Ohio", told Fox News that [...] "There’s some validity to this, {{for people who}} are susceptible." [...] Fox News wrote that Dr. Kikano said [...] "It's a new [...] "parallax" [...] function that causes the background of the phone to subtly move back and forth, a feature that leads to an effect not unlike car sickness. The inner ear is responsible for balance, the eyes for vision.

2500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>get</b> sexual {{pleasure}} by inserting objects, such as urethral sounds, into the urethra (the tube through which urine and, in men, semen, flows), a practice known as urethral play or [...] "sounding". Other {{objects such as}} ball point pens and thermometers are sometimes used, although this practice can lead to injury and/or infection. Some people masturbate by using machines that simulate intercourse.|$|E
2500|$|Essentially, the key {{components}} to Parker's pedal setup is a Holy Grail reverb into a Blues Driver into a Carbon Copy delay into a Dyna Comp into a Small Stone phaser into a Fuzz Face {{and then into}} a Diamond Vibrato (vibrato added during Lonerism-era). The reverb into a fuzz and phasers set to a slow rate are the hallmarks of Parker's guitar sound, which has influenced many modern psychedelic rock bands to have a similar setup, which Parker says [...] "it’s the most flattering {{thing in the world}} to hear a band ripping you off. I know <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>get</b> pissed off by it, but if I ever hear an artist and I can tell they’re using a phaser pedal the way I do, it’s a massive compliment. It makes you feel like you’re making an impression, having an impact on people, which is really humbling, flattering".|$|E
2500|$|..... {{everybody}} {{hated him}} because he was very dry, and I thought he was wonderful because he was very dry. And Barrow made me realize that all my romantic views of art were nonsense. I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>get</b> it developed and some don't.|$|E

He broke our heart for a reason! We wrote these songs for today… for may 10th 2011!!! We did it. Its all okay now!!'

If it should die it would be of no use for you to talk about practical jokes. You would be held responsible for its death. I was going to say to you that it might be as well for you not to say anything about this little venture until I had seen how Williamson Green took the joke. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>get</b> angry with very little reason, although I hardly believe he's that sort of a man; but now things are different.

60|$|Now, I dare say, {{you never}} got up at three o'clock on a midsummer morning. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>get</b> up then {{because they want to}} catch salmon; and some because they want to climb Alps; and a great many more because they must, like Tom. But, I assure you, that three o'clock on a midsummer morning is the pleasantest time of all the twenty-four hours, and all the three hundred and sixty-five days; and why every one does not get up then, I never could tell, save that they are all {{determined}} to spoil their nerves and their complexions by doing all night what they might just as well do all day. But Tom, instead of going out to dinner at half-past eight at night, and to a ball at ten, and finishing off somewhere between twelve and four, went to bed at seven, when his master went to the public-house, and slept like a dead pig; for which reason he was as piert as a game-cock (who always gets up early to wake the maids), and just ready to get up when the fine gentlemen and ladies were just ready to go to bed.|$|E
6000|$|If Gibson admired Stephenson, however, he did {{not wholly}} admire Stephenson's railways. The England he had left was the England of mail-coaches. In Italy, he had learnt to travel by carriage, after the fashion of the country; but these new {{whizzing}} locomotives, with their time-tables, and their precision, and their inscrutable mysteries of shunts and junctions, were quite too much for his simple, childish, old-world habits. He had a knack of getting out too soon or too late, which often led him into great confusion. Once, {{when he wanted to}} go to Chichester, he found himself landed at Portsmouth, and only discovered his mistake when, on asking the way to the cathedral, he was told there was no cathedral in the town at all. Another story of how he tried to reach Wentworth, Lord Fitzwilliam's place, is best told in his own words. [...] "The train soon stopped at a small station, and, seeing <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>get</b> out, I also descended; when, in a moment, the train moved on--faster and faster--and left me standing on the platform. I walked a few paces backward and forward in disagreeable meditation. 'I wish to Heaven,' thought I to myself, 'that I was on my way back to Rome with a postboy.' Then I observed a policeman darting his eyes upon me, as if he would look me through. Said I to the fellow, 'Where is that cursed train gone to? It's off with my luggage and here am I.' The man asked me the name of the place where I took my ticket. 'I don't remember,' said I. 'How should I know the name of any of these places?--it's as long as my arm. I've got it written down somewhere.' 'Pray, sir,' said the man, after a little pause, 'are you a foreigner?' 'No,' I replied, 'I am not a foreigner; I'm a sculptor.'" ...|$|E

50|$|A {{proportional}} division {{does not}} always exist.

Nevertheless, such a division exists with high probability for indivisible items under certain assumptions on the valuations of the agents.|$|R

50|$|The age is an {{important}} factor, because as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>get</b> older the veins which carry blood from the legs back to the heart do not {{work as well as}} they use to. This causes fluid to settle in the lower legs.|$|E
50|$|Some people {{experience}} sexual excitement {{from the look}} or feel of a women's bra. The attraction may be to the look or feel of the material, such as lace, or how it looks on a person. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>get</b> excitement from removing a bra.|$|E
