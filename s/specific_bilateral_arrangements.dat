40|$|Although it is {{generally}} acknowledged that international mobile roaming charges are too high, a successful formula for achieving reduction has so far proven elusive. Direct regulatory intervention to lower prices may be required. The success of such an approach depends upon the ability of countries to implement mutual reductions in the inter-operator tariffs (IOTs) that mobile operators charge each other for originating and terminating roaming calls. In {{the absence of a}} multilateral response, some countries have entered into <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> to reduce IOTs. Questions have been raised about the compatibility of such <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> with countries' obligations under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (the GATS), which generally forbids member countries from maintaining preferential arrangements with other countries that affect international trade in services. I identify and discuss two issues that arise about the application of the GATS to these bilateral arrangements: (1) How do the provisions of the GATS requiring parties to treat each others' service suppliers 'no less favourably' than they treat service suppliers of other countries and to offer non-discriminatory terms for network access apply to such <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements?</b> (2) Given that the GATS applies only to official measures affecting international trade in services, how does the GATS apply to <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> between mobile operators which are ostensibly private in character but which are concluded at the instigation of officials? As I note in the conclusion, these issues have yet to be resolved...|$|R

They {{do this by}} allowing the broker to run surpluses over a reservation expected utility in some states and deficits in others. We show that these contracts are manipulable by coalitions. This motivates our main contribution [...] the definition and characterization of coalition incentive compatible tripartite contracts. We then ask whether broker intermediation can still be useful. The answer is that not every coalition incentive compatibility requirement annuls the critical budget-breaking property. Specifically, if firm-broker coalitions are feasible, there is no three-party contract that is coalition incentive compatible and Pareto superior to bilateral firm-worker contracts, except in the extreme case where the workers' demand for leisure is income inelastic But if only a firm-worker coalition can form, {{the addition of a}} broker to a <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangement</b> does reduce the welfare losses caused by the existence of asymmetric information. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} the bilateral clearing agreement following the separation of Czechoslovakia. The value of the Czech and Slovak Clearing Agreement (CSCA) depended on its ability to relieve pressure on convertible currency reserves and preserve inter-republic trade. The assessment is made by measuring the trend in the Czech and Slovak cases and comparing these results to instances without a <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The CSCA experience reveals that a more widespread use of <b>bilateral</b> clearing <b>arrangements</b> by other transition economies might have provided little in terms of stability to convertible currency reserves. However, the evidence indicates a more positive effect on inter-republic trade than that attained under a number of non-bilateral scenarios. ...|$|R

One of those who saw such a security link was Cordell Hull, the United States Secretary of State from 1933 to 1944. Hull believed that the fundamental causes of {{the two world wars}} lay in economic discrimination and trade warfare. Specifically, he had in mind the trade and exchange controls (<b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements)</b> of Nazi Germany and the imperial preference system practiced by Britain, by which members or former members of the British Empire were accorded special trade status, itself provoked by German, French, and American protectionist policies.

50|$|Furthermore, these {{challenges}} presented by U.S {{could be explained}} more with the strong belief on bilateral alliances as instruments of control. Liberal institutionalists would argue, though, that great powers might still opt for a multilateral alliance. But great powers can amplify their capabilities to control small powers and maximize their leverage by forging a series of <b>bilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> with allies, rather than see that leverage diluted in a multilateral forum. Arguably, the George W. Bush administration favored intense bilateralism over multilateralism, or even unilateralism, for similar reasons. Rather than going it alone or going it with others, the administration opted for intensive one-on-one relationships with handpicked countries that maximized the U.S. capacity to achieve its objectives.|$|R
