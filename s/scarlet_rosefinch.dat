50|$|Even {{though many}} species are {{socially}} monogamous, females can accept or actively seek mating {{outside of the}} relationship; extra-pair paternity is a mating pattern known to be affiliated with MHC-associated mate choice. Birds {{are one of the}} more commonly studied groups of animals to exhibit this sexual behavior. In the <b>scarlet</b> <b>rosefinch</b> Carpocus erythrinus, females engaged in extra-pair paternity much less frequently when their mates were MHC-heterozygous. In the Seychelles warbler Acrocephalus sechellensis, {{there was no evidence of}} MHC variation between social mates. However, when females' social mates were MHC-similar, they were more likely to participate in extra-pair paternity; in most cases, the extra-pair male was significantly more MHC-dissimilar than the social mate.|$|E
5000|$|The Rauchua / Kyttyk wetland area is {{considered}} to be the easternmost extent of so-called [...] "Kolyma fauna", such as the Terek sandpiper, brown shrike and <b>scarlet</b> <b>rosefinch.</b> The most common bird species in the Rauchua / Kyttyk wetland are the yellow-billed, black-throated and Pacific divers. One of the main reasons for the importance of the Rauchua / Kyttyk is the breeding population (figures as of 1994) of Bewick's swan (approximately 300 birds), the Pacific eider (approximately 3,000 birds) and the spectacled eider (approximately 2,000 birds). Spectacled and Pacific eider as well as black-throated and Pacific divers are also found in the Ust-Chaun region, though the Pacific eider is much more common on the Kyttyl Peninsula and near Apapelgino.|$|E

Bird blood {{samples were collected}} during 8 years (from 2000 to 2008). Haemosporidian parasite prevalence exceeded 61 %. 24 unique cytochrome b lineages of three heamosporidian genera (Plasmodium, Heamoproteus, and Leucocytozoon) were recorded in the host species. While the most common lineage Haemoproteus ROFI 2 reached 53 % of prevalence, the other lineages were far less abundant. The prevalence slightly varied between years; however, the proportion of lineages remained almost stable in the whole studied period. We compared the methods of prevalence estimates and we found the nested PCR more efficient than investigating blood smears. We suppose that extremely low parasitemia is {{the main cause of}} the lower efficiency of the traditional detection methods. We have not found any significant effect of parasites on host characteristics (body mass, reproductive success and male ornamentation), however, the Mhc allele diversity and genetic variability measured as standardized heterozygosity at 17 [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Master's esis, 2007 Michal Vinkler 3 I ABSTRACT Within the {{contemporary}} theory {{on the sexual}} selection {{there are two main}} competing hypotheses concerning the female indirect benefits arising from the mate choice. The 'Good genes' hypothesis assumes that the female tends to gain for her progeny some generally beneficial alleles through mating with an appropriate male. On the other hand the 'Complementary genes' hypothesis supposes that the mate choice is governed by the female effort to obtain for her offspring the most fitting parental haplotypes. This thesis aimed to provide evidence for discrimination between these two hypotheses in <b>scarlet</b> <b>rosefinch.</b> Three principal aspects of the sexual selection were concerned: (1) the reliability of male ornamentation as an indicator of individual's quality; (2) the associations between parental traits and offspring health indicators and (3) the effect of paternity on offspring heterozygosity and immune responsiveness in mixed- paternity broods. The results indicate that male ornamentation is a reliable signal of individual's health which may be used by females in their mate choice. The ornamentation does not reflect male's heterozygosity. Moreover, the social father's ornamental plumage hue and saturation are good predictors of nestlings'health and immune [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Evolution {{is a most}} {{fascinating}} feature of all living things in our world. The means of organismal evolution are diverse, comprising mainly of natural and sexual selection. Both of these phenomena may contribute to evolutionary adaptations in health and disease. The questions of immunity impact {{on the process of}} sexual selection and sexual selection for increased anti-parasite resistance are wide issues of the present research in natural sciences. Their clarification requires multidisciplinarily-based investigation combining a variety of partial results into a single united paradigm. My co-workers and I have chosen several specific issues to study, in order to fill some of the important gaps of the current knowledge. We proposed the Carotenoid maintenance handicap hypothesis to point out that optimisation instead of maximisation of the carotenoid intake and ornamental display may be physiologically convenient for the individual. In <b>Scarlet</b> <b>rosefinch</b> (Carpodacus erythrinus) we confirmed the role of the carotenoid-based ornamental colouration in the process of sexual selection and investigated several partial aspects of the association between immunogenetics, immune function, health and the ornament expression and mate choice. In Zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) we have shown that the present way of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Extrapair fertilizations (EPFs) are {{frequently}} documented in songbirds; however, {{the extent to}} which this reproductive tactic contributes to variance in male reproductive success and hence the strength of sexual selection on males remains little studied. Using 2 approaches, intraspecific and comparative, we test the hypothesis that the contribution of EPFs to variance in male fitness increases with migration distance in north temperate songbirds. Using data on the genetic mating system of the <b>scarlet</b> <b>rosefinch</b> Carpodacus erythrinus, a long-distance migrant, we show that the number of extrapair mates and within-pair paternity are the most important components of variance in male reproductive success. There was no evidence of a trade-off between extrapair and within-pair success of individual males as males successful in procuring EPFs {{were less likely to be}} cuckolded. Comparative data reveal that the opportunity for sexual selection due to EPFs is positively associated with both migration distance and breeding synchrony in north temperate passerines, and we discuss several mechanisms that could extend these relationships. In general, these data suggest that EPFs have a potential to play an important role in the evolution of sexually selected traits in long-distance migratory songbirds such as rosefinches.

40|$|International audienceHaematological {{methods are}} widely {{utilised}} among avian ecologists {{as a means}} for individual health assessment. However, the technical simplicity of some of the tests may easily lead to oversimplification of the evaluation. Here, we show in the <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Rosefinch</b> () that haematological parameters other than the widely used heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio may be important to investigate. We give the full description of seven basic haematological traits (leukocyte differential count, immature erythrocyte count, haematocrit, mean cell volume, total red and white blood cell count and blood parasite occurrence). Most remarkably, the examination of 178 adults and 155 nestlings has revealed that this species has an extraordinarily high proportion of basophils among the peripheral blood leukocytes (on average about 42 and 56 %, respectively). Although the high basophil count is a general trait even in healthy individuals of this species, the proportion of these cells is condition-dependent and is further increased by infection. Our results also suggest that the immature erythrocyte count in the peripheral blood is a good predictor of the nestlings' growth rate. We conclude that the Rosefinch haematology differs strikingly from other avian species with known values of basic haematological parameters. We therefore emphasise the importance of a general haematological examination, based on material obtained by an appropriate method (e. g. for smear preparation, we recommend using differential staining and avoiding prior methanol fixation) ...|$|E
