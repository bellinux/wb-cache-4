30|$|We now justify {{constraining}} {{the use of}} {{a single}} MF at the eavesdropper. An MF is the optimal demodulator for achieving a maximal SNR from the received signal [35]. Using multiple MFs connected to a <b>signal</b> <b>antenna</b> makes no sense because the joint constellation is constructed over a single complex dimension for any number of transmitters. It follows that the optimal choice for the eavesdropper is to use a single MF with soft decoding. If the eavesdropper would try to use multiple antennas for finding the bit mapping faster (for decreasing the unicity distance), the result would be multiple equivalent deciphering problems and the eavesdropper would gain nothing as far as deciphering time is concerned.|$|E
40|$|Underground {{transportation}} systems are big energy consumers and have significant impacts on energy consumption at a regional scale. The literature {{has revealed that}} the energy consumption for non-traction purposes may be of the same magnitude as the energy used to move rolling stock, {{and in some cases}} even greater. However, most of the research conducted so far has focused on the energy demand of rolling stock. This paper investigates the electricity consumption of an underground metro station using data from on-site surveys and measurements. With an average consumption of 217. 64 kWh/m(2) /year, the breakdown revealed that the lighting system dominated the underground station's energy consumption (37 %). Illuminated advertising signs were found to be responsible for 14 % of the total energy consumption, and ventilation accounted for another 14 %. The rest of the energy consumption was attributed to systems such as mobile phone <b>signal</b> <b>antenna</b> (12 %), the vertical transportation system (8 %) and small power devices (5 %). Accurate information on energy consumption for non-traction usage is useful for future implementation of energy conservation measures in underground stations, which could result in a reduction of operating costs in the long run.

30|$|In {{wireless}} communications, the {{bit error}} rate (BER) is an important metric {{which is used to}} gauge and compare the system performance. Since this noise modulated covert communications system is a new architecture, the theoretical BER performance in an additive white Gaussian noise channel is derived and compared with simulation results in this section. Unlike other single-channel spread spectrum systems, the low-pass equivalent model can directly be used to model the system behavior in the Gaussian channel. The spreading and dispreading process of our system is accomplished at the RF front-end. The noise floor at the antenna output {{is not the same as}} that at the output of the first mixer, and the noise terms within the system are generated by mixing of two zero mean independent Gaussian random variables. Thus, the system behavior needs to be modeled based upon the relationship between the SNR at the output of receiver antenna and the probability of bit error. In this section, we will demonstrate that the mixed noise can be approximated as Gaussian after passing through a narrow-band filter, and the BER equation can be expressed using the Q-function. The bandwidths of the <b>signal,</b> <b>antenna,</b> low-pass filter, and the SNR at the output of receiver's antenna are the parameters which dominate the BER when the bit rate is fixed.|$|E
40|$|Raytheon is {{a defense}} {{contracting}} company {{with an electronic}} warfare division that is developing a radio frequency signal triangulation system. Part of the focus in improving this technology {{is the need for}} accurate and real time locational knowledge of the signal receivers, which are located at the tips of aircraft wings. Due to turbulence during flight, the fluttering motion of the wings alter the distance and angle relationships of the two receivers and add noise to the received signal data, which negatively affect the triangulation estimates. To mitigate this error caused by the wing flutter, Raytheon is developing a software algorithm that predicts the precise locations of the signal receivers in space to attempt to clean up the incoming signal data. As part of the development process at Raytheon, {{there is a need for}} a device that can move a <b>signal</b> <b>antenna</b> in random, flutter-like motion so rapid testing and refinement of the algorithm can be done. Thus Raytheon has made this project available for us to complete. This project was completed over the course of one year, which was divided into three distinct phases of development. The first phase of the design process was research and design ideation. In this step, the project specifications that the completed device would have to meet was defined. Research into existing systems and available technologies was done to gain knowledge of the wide range of possible solutions that could be explored. During the second phase of the design process, various actuation methods and their feasibility for use in this project were analyzed, while iterative refinement of the device was also underway in parallel. The last phase involved building and testing the final design of the project. The final product that was born out of this process is a two axis, large amplitude, low frequency shake device. The vertical axis is belt-driven with a servo drive and meets the required maximum motion of 11 inch stroke at 1. 6 Hz. The horizontal axis is rack and pinion driven with a DC motor that is controlled by an Arduino board in closed loop control that met the maximum motion requirement of 1. 1 inch stroke at 3. 2 Hz. Both of the drive systems were capable of generating a pseudorandom motion that resembles the flutter of wingtips...|$|E
