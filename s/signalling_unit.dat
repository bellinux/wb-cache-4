40|$|The minimal <b>signalling</b> <b>unit</b> for {{tyrosine}} kinase receptors is two protomers dimerized {{by one or}} more ligands. However, it is clear that maximal signalling requires the formation of larger complexes of many receptors at discrete foci on the cell surface. The biological interactions that lead to this are likely to be diverse and have system specific components. In the present study, we demonstrate that, in the FGF (fibroblast growth factor) -FGFR (FGF receptor) system, multimers of the minimal complex composed of two FGF 1 and two FGFR 2 protomers can form on a single chain of the co-receptor heparin. Using size-exclusion chromatography, we show that two complexes can form on heparin chains as small as 16 saccharide units. We also show by MS that discrete complexes containing exactly two copies of the minimal <b>signalling</b> <b>unit</b> are formed. However, the doublet of complexes appears to be less co-operative than the formation of the 2 : 2 : 1 FGF 1 :FGFR 2 :heparin complex, suggesting that this mechanism is {{one of a number of}} weaker interactions that might be involved in the formation of a focal complex on the cell surface...|$|E

40|$|T~cell activation, {{initiated}} by T~cell receptor (TCR) mediated recognition of pathogen derived peptides presented by {{major histocompatibility complex}} class I or II molecules (pMHC), shows exquisite specificity and sensitivity, even though the TCR-pMHC binding interaction is of low affinity. Recent experimental work suggests that TCR pre-clustering may be a mechanism via which T~cells can achieve such high sensitivity. The unresolved stoichiometry of the TCR makes TCR-pMHC binding and TCR triggering an open question. We formulate a mathematical model to characterise the pre-clustering of T~cell receptors (TCRs) {{on the surface of}} T~cells, motivated by the experimentally-observed distribution of TCR clusters on the surface of naive and memory T~cells. We extend a recently-introduced stochastic criterion to compute the timescales of T~cell responses, assuming that ligand-induced cross-linked TCR is the minimum <b>signalling</b> <b>unit.</b> We derive an approximate formula for the mean time to signal initiation. Our results show that pre-clustering reduces the mean activation time. However, additional mechanisms favouring the existence of clusters are required to explain the difference between naive and memory T~cell responses. We discuss the biological implications of our results, and both the compatibility and complementarity of our approach with other existing mathematical models...|$|E
40|$|Cells have to {{regulate}} their volume {{in order to}} survive. Moreover, it is now evident that cell volume per se and the membrane transport processes which regulate it, comprise an important <b>signalling</b> <b>unit.</b> For example, macromolecular synthesis, apoptosis, cell growth and hormone secretion are all influenced by the cellular hydration state. Therefore, {{a thorough understanding of}} volume-activated transport processes could lead to new strategies being developed to control the function and growth of both normal and cancerous cells. Cell swelling stimulates the release of ions such as K+ and Cl- together with organic osmolytes, especially the β-amino acid taurine. Despite being the subject of intense research interest, the nature of the volume-activated taurine efflux pathway is still a matter of controversy. On the one hand {{it has been suggested that}} osmosensitive taurine efflux utilizes volume-sensitive anion channels whereas on the other it has been proposed that the band 3 anion-exchanger is a swelling-induced taurine efflux pathway. This article reviews the evidence for and against a role of anion channels and exchangers in osmosensitive taurine transport. Furthermore, the distinct possibility that neither pathway is involved in taurine transport is highlighted. The putative relationship between swelling-induced taurine transport and volume-activated anionic amino acid, α-neutral amino acid and K+ transport is also examined...|$|E

Using these probes detection can being accomplished with simple readily available instrumentation (when using colorimetric probes) and at extremely low detection limits (when using fluorescence probes). π-Conjugated heterocyclic compounds are versatile systems {{with a wide range}} of applications in diverse areas such as supramolecular, medicinal or materials chemistry due to their biological activity, as well their optoelectronic properties. 1 - 3 In particular for the design of chromo-flurogenic probes, heterocyclic systems containing chelating groups have the ability to act as both the recognition unit, as well as the <b>signalling</b> <b>unit,</b> since variation of their absorption/fluorescence properties can happen during the recognition event. Generally, -conjugated heterocyclic systems increase intramolecular electron delocalisation, enhancing photophysical properties.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Proper {{compartmentalization}} of signalling cascades {{is paramount}} to many intracellular activities during spermatogenesis and sperm function. In {{the present study}} {{we focus on the}} A-kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP) WAVE 1, a member of the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WASP) family of adaptor proteins, to study its localization throughout mammalian spermatogenesis. METHODS: Using transmission electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry and western blotting, we examined the distribution of WAVE 1 and putative partners during mammalian spermatogenesis. The localization and association of PKA RII, the regulatory subunit II of protein kinase A, tyrosine kinase Abl, and small GTPase RAC 1 were also explored. RESULTS: WAVE 1 localization in spermatocytes and round spermatids coincided with Golgi apparatus distribution, whereas in elongated spermatids and testicular sperm WAVE 1 localized to the mitochondrial sheath. Following epididymal passage, WAVE 1 was found exclusively on the mitochondrial sheath, suggesting that the protein may function in this region. WAVE 1 and PKA RII co-localized along the mitochondrial sheath, PKA RII concentrates in the mid-piece, and RAC 1 associated with the post-acrosomal region and the connecting piece. The distribution of WAVE 1, PKA RII and RAC 1 is conserved in mature mouse, bull, baboon and human sperm. CONCLUSIONS: The data support the possibility of a functional <b>signalling</b> <b>unit</b> established by WAVE 1 and its associated proteins in the mid-piece of maturing sperm...|$|E

We developed {{a series of}} surface-active small-molecule inhibitors, such as myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (MiTMAB) and octadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (OcTMAB), and we now show MiTMAB targets the dynamin-phospholipid interaction. MiTMAB inhibited dynamin GTPase activity, with a Ki of 940 ± 25 nM. It potently inhibited receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) of transferrin or epidermal growth factor (EGF) {{in a range of}} cells without blocking EGF binding, receptor number, or autophosphorylation. RME inhibition was rapidly reversed after washout. The rank order of potency for a variety of MiTMAB analogs on RME matched the rank order for dynamin inhibition, suggesting dynamin recruitment to the membrane is a primary cellular target. MiTMAB also inhibited synaptic vesicle endocytosis in rat brain nerve terminals (synaptosomes) without inducing depolarization or morphological defects. Therefore, the drug rapidly and reversibly blocks multiple forms of endocytosis with no acute cellular damage. The unique mechanism of action of MiTMAB provides an important tool to better understand dynamin-mediated membrane trafficking events in a variety of cells...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} importance that nanotechnologies have in everyday life, {{it is not}} difficult to realize that also a single molecule, if properly designed, can be a device able to perform useful functions: such a chemical species is called chemosensor, that is a molecule of abiotic origin that signals the presence of matter or energy. Signal transduction is the mechanism by which an interaction of a sensor with an analyte yields a measurable form of energy. When dealing with the design of a chemosensor, we need to take into account a “communication requirement” between its three component: the receptor unit, responsible for the selective analyte binding, the spacer, which controls the geometry of the system and modulates the electronic interaction between the receptor and the <b>signalling</b> <b>unit,</b> whose physico-chemical properties change upon complexation. A luminescent chemosensor communicates a variation of the physico-chemical properties of the receptor unit with a luminescence output signal. This thesis work consists in the characterization of new molecular and nanoparticle-based system which can be used as sensitive materials for the construction of new optical transduction devices able to provide information about the concentration of analytes in solution. In particular two direction were taken. The first is to continue in the development of new chemosensors, that is the first step for the construction of reliable and efficient devices, and in particular the work will be focused on chemosensors for metal ions for biomedical and environmental applications. The second is to study more efficient and complex organized systems, such as derivatized silica nanoparticles. These system can potentially have higher sensitivity than molecular systems, and present many advantages, like the possibility to be ratiometric, higher Stokes shifts and lower signal-to-noise ratio...|$|E

40|$|During tumour dissemination, invading breast {{carcinoma}} cells become {{confronted with}} a reactive stroma, a type I collagen-rich environment endowed with anti-proliferative and proapoptotic properties. To develop metastatic capabilities, tumour cells must acquire the capacity {{to cope with this}} novel microenvironment. How cells interact with and respond to their microenvironment during cancer dissemination remains poorly understood. To address the impact of type I collagen on the fate of tumour cells, human breast carcinoma MCF- 7 cells were cultured within three-dimensional type I collagen gels (3 D COL 1). Using this experimental model, we demonstrate that membrane type- 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT 1 -MMP), a proteinase overexpressed in many aggressive tumours, promotes tumour progression by circumventing the collagen-induced up-regulation of BIK, a pro-apoptotic tumour suppressor, and hence apoptosis. A transcriptomic analysis was performed to decipher the molecular mechanisms regulating 3 D COL 1 -induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. Control and MT 1 -MMP expressing MCF- 7 cells were cultured on two-dimensional plastic plates or within 3 D COL 1 and a global transcriptional time-course analysis was performed. Shifting the cells from plastic plates to 3 D COL 1 activated a complex reprogramming of genes implicated in various biological processes. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a 3 D COL 1 -mediated alteration of key cellular functions including apoptosis, cell proliferation, RNA processing and cytoskeleton remodelling. By using a panel of pharmacological inhibitors, we identified discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR 1), a receptor tyrosine kinase specifically activated by collagen, as the initiator of 3 D COL 1 -induced apoptosis. Our data support the concept that MT 1 -MMP contributes to the inactivation of the DDR 1 -BIK signalling axis through the cleavage of collagen fibres and/or the alteration of DDR 1 receptor <b>signalling</b> <b>unit,</b> without triggering drastic alterations of the transcriptome of MCF- 7 cells.

40|$|Fluorogenic sensing and {{signalling}} of biologically relevant small molecules, {{with a major}} {{emphasis on}} sulfur containing ones, draws {{a great deal of}} attention. Among these, sulfur dioxide (SO 2), a well-known air pollutant and a common food preservative/additive (E 220 – 228), both in the form of gas and/or alkali salts (sulfites), is at the focus of many recent works. 1 Sulfites are also commonly used to prevent browning of foods and beverages. However, exposure to high doses of them by either topical, oral, or parental feeding is reported to be associated with a number diseases such as allergic asthma, urticarial, dermatitis, hypotension, and abdominal pain. Consequently, the use of sulfites as antimicrobial agents/food additives is restricted by both local and international legislation (upper limit = 0. 7 mgkg- 1 of body weight; World Health Organisation—WHO). Furthermore, sulfurdioxide is produced endogenously and found to exhibit unique bioactivities such as vasodilatation and lowering of blood pressure, and thus, is speculated to be a gasotransmitter. Building upon these, both signalling and quantification of sulfites in a sample of food/beverage or in biological matrices is of great importance, both fundamental and practical. Although a large number of sulfite probes have been developed so far, most of them yet suffer from low sulfite selectivity, low water solubility, long incubation times and strong pH dependency, all of which reduce the chances of their use in practical applications. Herein we wish to describe some water-soluble 2 -/ 3 -formyl-BODIPY dyes to address that challenge (vide supra). Bodipy is chosen as the <b>signalling</b> <b>unit</b> of the probes because of their excellent photophysical and phsyco-chemical properties, such as high photostability, non-agregation in water, low pH dependent emission, narrow bandwidths, and absorbtion/emission in the visible region of electromagnetic radiation etc. To this end, we introduced some water-solubilizing groups of both neutral 2 and ionic character through meso- (or 8 -) position of the Bodipy fluorophores. These water soluble dyes are then made to carry formyl functionality at 2 - and 3 -positions of the BODIPY core by making use of recently established protocols to unravel the role of substitution pattern of the peripheral formyl unit, if any. Among 2 - and 3 -formyl dyes, 3 -substituted one gave the largest emission enhancement (> 40 -fold) upon sulfite attack in aqueous solutions and water. Its low pH dependency coupled with exceptional sulfite specificity over a number of competing biocongeners and anions makes it promising for many applications. The sensing mechanism is speculated on the well-known sulfite-aldehyde reaction, which is expected to unblock the internal charge transfer (ICT) and/or photo-induced electron transfer (PET) processes and thereby restore the fluorescence emission of unaltered BODIPY dye by breaking the π-conjugation (sp 2 →sp 3).
