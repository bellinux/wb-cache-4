5|$|Although the Hiorns had descendants, {{the estate}} was {{managed by the}} Public Trustee, who put Linwood House up for sale as four {{sections}}, {{with one of those}} holding the house itself.

5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist <b>sections</b> <b>and</b> separate first, second and third class compartments within each. This separation applied to both living and dead passengers. This was to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment, rather than to provide different levels of facilities for different types of mourner; the compartments intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors. At 11.35am (11.20am on Sundays) the train would leave London for Brookwood, arriving at Necropolis Junction at 12.25pm (12.20pm on Sundays).|$|E
