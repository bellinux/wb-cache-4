5|$|In 1975, {{after working}} in Singapore, Tommy and Hal Meadow {{returned}} to the US with what they <b>say</b> <b>were</b> three local brown-ticked cats. These three cats, a pair {{of male and female}} kittens from the same litter and another young female, were the foundation used to establish the Singapura. The breed takes its name from the Malay name for Singapore. In 1981 a breeder visited Singapore and chanced upon a cat fitting the profile of the Singapura (with the exception of the tail) in the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The cat was imported to the US and adopted into the breeding program.|$|E

2500|$|Hentz {{became a}} {{pioneering}} zoologist {{in the field}} of arachnology. In France, he had developed a long lasting friendship with Thomas Say (17871834). Originally, he and <b>Say</b> <b>were</b> going to collaborate and illustrate a collection called [...] "American Entomology". [...] In the United States, Hentz took to collecting insects. He sold his collection to the Boston Society of Natural History in the 1840s. Hentz is best known for describing 141 spider species and these descriptions were published in the society's journal between 1842 and 1850. He {{was one of the first}} to collect and document North American spiders. As is custom in binomial naming, each species was noted with his name and the year Hentz classified them. A few spiders from his collection are the Yellow sac spider, the Southern house spider, a common tarantula, and a genus of jumping spider.|$|E
2500|$|Various organizations, such as Human Rights Watch, {{have called}} for {{investigations}} of Rumsfeld regarding his involvement in managing the Iraq War and his support of the Bush administration's policies of [...] "enhanced interrogation techniques", which are widely regarded as torture. Scholars have argued that Rumsfeld could [...] "probably {{be held responsible for}} ordering, sollicitating (sic) or inducing war crimes". In 2005 the ACLU and Human Rights First filed a lawsuit against Rumsfeld and other top government officials, [...] "on behalf of eight men who they <b>say</b> <b>were</b> subjected to torture and abuse by U.S. forces under the command of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld". In 2005, a suit was filed against Rumsfeld by several human rights organizations for allegedly violating U.S. and international law that prohibits [...] "torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment". Donald Vance and Nathan Ertel filed suit against the U.S. government and Rumsfeld on similar grounds, alleging that they were tortured and their rights of habeas corpus were violated. In 2007, U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan ruled that Rumsfeld could not [...] "be held personally responsible for actions taken in connection with his government job". The ACLU tried to revive the case in 2011 with no success.|$|E

2500|$|The ranch, {{located in}} west Uintah County {{bordering}} the Ute Indian Reservation, was popularly dubbed the [...] "UFO ranch" [...] {{due to its}} ostensible 50-year history of odd events said {{to have taken place}} there. Knapp and Kelleher cite the 1974 book The Utah UFO Display: A Scientist's Report by Frank Salisbury and Joseph [...] "Junior" [...] Hicks, which details an earlier investigation into alleged UFO sightings in the Uintah County region, as partial confirmation of their account. According to Kelleher and Knapp, they saw or investigated evidence of close to 100 incidents that include vanishing and mutilated cattle, sightings of unidentified flying objects or orbs, large animals with piercing red eyes that they <b>say</b> <b>were</b> not injured when struck by bullets, and invisible objects emitting destructive magnetic fields. Among those involved were retired Army Colonel John B. Alexander who characterized the NIDSci effort as an attempt to get hard data using a [...] "standard scientific approach". [...] However, the investigators admitted to [...] "difficulty obtaining evidence consistent with scientific publication." [...] Cattle mutilations {{have been part of the}} folklore of the surrounding area for decades, but NIDSci founder Robert Bigelow's purchase of the ranch and investigation funding was reportedly the result of his being convinced by stories of mutilations that included tales of strange lights and unusual impressions made in grass and soil told by the family of former ranch owner Terry Sherman.|$|E
2500|$|Denver's first {{marriage}} was to Anne Martell of St. Peter, Minnesota. She {{was the subject}} of his hit [...] "Annie's Song," [...] which he composed in only ten minutes as he sat on a Colorado ski lift after the couple had an argument. They lived in Edina, Minnesota, from 1968 to 1971. Following the success of [...] "Rocky Mountain High", inspired by a camping trip with Anne and some friends, Denver purchased a residence in Aspen, Colorado. He lived in Aspen continuously until his death. The Denvers adopted a boy, Zachary John, and girl, Anna Kate, who Denver would <b>say</b> <b>were</b> [...] "meant to be" [...] theirs. Denver once said, [...] "I'll tell you the best thing about me. I'm some guy's dad; I'm some little gal's dad. When I die, Zachary John and Anna Kate's father, boy, that's enough for me to be remembered by. That's more than enough." [...] Zachary, who is African-American, {{was the subject of}} [...] "A Baby Just Like You", a song that included the line [...] "Merry Christmas, little Zachary" [...] and which he wrote for Frank Sinatra. Denver and Martell divorced in 1982. In a 1983 interview shown in the documentary John Denver: Country Boy (2013), Denver said that career demands drove them apart; Anne said that they were too young and immature to deal with John's sudden mega-success. The ensuing property settlement caused Denver to become so enraged, he nearly choked Martell, then used a chainsaw to cut their marital bed in half.|$|E
