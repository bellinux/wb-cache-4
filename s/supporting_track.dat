50|$|The Bregans lens {{is a large}} lens, {{mounted in}} a gilt wooden frame, with a focal length of 1,580 mm. Another smaller lens acts as a {{condenser}} and can be positioned {{by means of a}} sliding mechanism along a <b>supporting</b> <b>track.</b> Beyond the condenser is a small adjustable metal plate for holding specimens. The wooden mount on a small table fitted with castors, dated 1767, is the work of the Florentine artisan Francesco Spighi; the metal parts are signed by Gaspero Mazzeranghi. The maker of the lens, Benedetto Bregans, donated it to Cosimo III de' Medici in 1697. The instrument was used some time later by Giuseppe Averani and Cipriano Targioni for experiments on the combustion of diamonds and other precious stones. In 1814, Humphry Davy — on a visit to Florence with Michael Faraday — used the lens to repeat Averani's experiments. In 1860, Giovanni Battista Donati mounted the lens on a tube (inv. 582) for use as a starlight condenser to observe the absorption bands of stellar spectra.|$|E

5000|$|Pitchfork Media {{reviewer}} Tom Breihan {{gave the}} album 6.3 out of ten, saying: [...] "Thanks to his brother's beyond-the-grave contributions, he himself {{is the most}} disposable part of his own debut album. Luckily for him, it probably won't be too hard to find another hour's worth of unused Dilla tracks {{when it comes time}} to record the follow-up." [...] Dave Heaton of PopMatters gave the album a seven out of ten, saying: [...] "Dilla's music has that elemental quality, like it's air or water, a manifestation of nature. That's true whether it's an instrumental project like Donuts or a <b>supporting</b> <b>track</b> for a rapper. Illa J seems to understand that about Dilla's music. He keeps Yancey Boys in that same natural/mystical space, carrying on his brother's spirit while making a strong, if not explosive, mark as his own artist." [...] XLR8Rs Eric K. Arnold gave the album a seven out of ten, saying: [...] "Yancey Boys isn't overly inundated with features, making it a true family affair as well as a delight for head-nodders." [...] KevinNottingham.com gave the album a 75 out of 100, saying: [...] "Whether it was on purpose or not, Illa J's presence takes the backseat on this album, and Dilla's legacy of work shines through. The periodic off-beat bars and the mediocre rhymes proves that Illa J is far from a polished lyricist, however, Illa understands how to compliment Dilla's work in such a way that it highlights every beat, break and soulfulness within the production. Whether Yancey Boys purpose is to engage the listener to the sounds of neo-soul or to highlight J Dilla's endless talent, this release is an effortless listen, and ultimately an album worth giving a chance." ...|$|E
30|$|Discrete {{rail support}} model and {{continuous}} rail support model are two classical {{models for the}} traditional mechanical analysis of railway track [1, 2]. In the discrete rail support model, the stiffness of fastener <b>supporting</b> <b>track</b> is a spring constant, while in the continuous rail support model, it is denoted by track modulus, which is calculated with the spring constant divided by the spacing between centers of discrete supports. The stiffness measurement method based on the Winkler elastic foundation model uses track modulus to characterize the overall track stiffness.|$|E

As shown on figure 1, a typical active railroad cross-section is composed of a clean ballast layer, then a transition layer of mostly clean ballast and finally a fouled ballast (or subballast) layer directly in contact with the subgrade. Subballast is sand or gravel used to provide drainage and, along with ballast, to distribute the dynamic loading applied by trains into the subgrade.

30|$|First, a {{comprehensive}} locomotive-track model is generated using a multi-body dynamics approach with GENSYS software, {{which is a}} tool for modelling vehicles running on rails (but in its design GENSYS is a general multi purpose software package for modelling mechanical, electrical and/or mathematical problems). In the locomotive model [15, 16, 17], the car-body, bogie frames, wheelsets and driving motors are considered as rigid bodies; detailed modelling of the <b>supporting</b> <b>track</b> structure is also considered. Second, quantitative relationships between {{the characteristics of the}} bogie frame or axle box accelerations and the rail defects are determined through simulations. Finally, defect analysis is combined and compared with historical data. The proposed approach will enhance the ability for more regular detailed monitoring and assessment of the track system, allowing the implementation of more informed and proactive track maintenance strategies.|$|E
40|$|Track {{operations}} require specialized {{machinery and}} equipment. Among them, the SM 42 locomotive is an indispensable vehicle. Locomotives {{of this type}} have a significantly different nature of work compared to locomotives used in passenger and freight traffic. A large percentage share {{of the work is}} engine running under idle and under low load. The nature of the load is, among other things, the cause of high fuel consumption. Such a situation calls for a number of necessary technical and organizational activities, leading, inter alia, to reducing energy consumption. The article provides preliminary operational analyzes aimed at identifying the potential for reduce energy consumption by the SM 42 locomotive, <b>supporting</b> <b>track</b> works. As a result of reducing the locomotive’s downtime with running engine by half, fuel consumption was reduced by approximately 16 %...|$|E
