50|$|While {{appendectomy}} is {{a standard}} surgical procedure, its cost {{has been found to}} vary considerably in the United States. A 2012 study analyzed 2009 data from nearly 20,000 adult patients treated for appendicitis in California hospitals. Researchers examined “only uncomplicated episodes of acute appendicitis” that involved “visits for patients 18 to 59 years old with hospitalization that lasted fewer than four days with routine discharges to home.” The lowest charge for removal of an appendix was $1,529 and the highest $182,955, more than 120 times greater. The median charge was $33,611. While the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> California, the researchers indicated that the results were applicable anywhere in the United States.

50|$|AustraliaJeremy Hayman, {{a senior}} {{lecturer}} at Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand specializing in Human Resource Management and Employee Relations collected data and completed a questionnaire from office employees {{in a large}} Western Australia university. Though the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> University employees, the primary and recognized finding is that the flexibility provided by job sharing can benefit the integration of work, family and personal life, ultimately providing a better work experience for the employee and a better work environment especially in women aged 30-39. Though the literature on job share in Australia is largely under represented compared to other developed countries, Hayman's research was more responsive then other preexisting Australian surveys regarding job share.

50|$|The amygdala, {{which is}} the {{structure}} that responds to emotionally arousing information, respond {{to the environment and}} reacts with stress. The male amygdala is proportionally larger than that in women, causing sex to be a determining factor in reactions to stress. In studies of rats, there are more numerous interconnections seen in males in regard to this structure, suggesting the same pattern in humans. Katharina Braun and company (Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany) studied a litter of Degu puppies removed from their mother and determined that hearing their mother's call produced a higher concentration of serotonin in males' amygdala and a decreased concentration in females' amygdala. In this case, stress causes females' emotion regulation to drop, while males seem to keep more of an even keel. While this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> rodents, it provides a possible explanation of why anxiety disorders occur more often among human females than males. Also, the hypothalamus and frontomedial area, both of which are associated with emotional processing, are larger in males than females. Other brain areas related to emotion, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, medial paralimbic region and hippocampus are larger in females than males.|$|E
50|$|The {{research}} {{that appeared to}} spark an onslaught of modified applications was a gel permeation chromatography technique of fixing poly(isopropyl acrylate) (PIPA) strands to glass beads and separating a mixture of dextrans, which was developed by Gewehr et al. They found that between the temperatures of 25-32 °C, the elution time of dextrans at different molecular weights exhibited a dependence on the temperature. Dextrans of the highest molecular weight eluted first since the PIPA chains exhibit hydrophilicity at temperatures below the LCST. As {{the temperature of the}} elution increased, when the chains behave in a more hydrophobic manner, the elution times increased for each of the analytes for the given range. The trend generally applies over the entire temperature range, but there is a flattening of the curve before 25 °C and after 32 °C (the approximate LCST for this experiment). It {{is important to note that}} above the LCST, the PIPA acts as a typical nonpolar stationary phase that would be used in reverse-phased chromatography. There are also instances of the elution times increasing below 15 °C, which most likely can be attributed to the lower temperatures’ effects on mass transfer playing a more significant role on retention than the stationary phase behavior. This study showed that the resolution could essentially be tuned by adjusting the operating temperature. The scope of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> isothermal conditions and attaching polymer chains to glass beads. The results, however, were satisfying enough to inspire other investigations and modifications to create a more versatile stationary phase for the advancement of chromatography.|$|E
5000|$|Legislators, {{scientists}} {{and parents are}} debating the effects of television violence on viewers, particularly youth. Fifty years {{of research on the}} impact of television on children's emotional and social development have not ended this debate. Some scholars have claimed that the evidence clearly supports a causal relationship between media violence and societal violence. However, other authors note significant methodological problems with the literature and mismatch between increasing media violence and decreasing crime rates in the United States. [...] A 2002 article in Scientific American suggested that compulsive television watching, television addiction, was no different from any other addiction, a finding backed up by reports of withdrawal symptoms among families forced by circumstance to cease watching. However, this view has not yet received widespread acceptance among all scholars, and [...] "television addiction" [...] is not a diagnoseable condition according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual -IV -TR. [...] A longitudinal study in New Zealand involving 1000 people (from childhood to 26 years of age) demonstrated that [...] "television viewing in childhood and adolescence is associated with poor educational achievement by 12 years of age". The same paper noted that there was a significant negative association between time spent watching television per day as a child and educational attainment by age 26: the more time a child spent watching television at ages 5 to 15, the less likely they were to have a university degree by age 26. However, recent research (Schmidt et al., 2009) has indicated that, once other factors are controlled for, television viewing appears to have little to no impact on cognitive performance, contrary to previous thought. [...] However, this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> cognitive performance in childhood. Numerous studies have also examined the relationship between TV viewing and school grades.|$|E
