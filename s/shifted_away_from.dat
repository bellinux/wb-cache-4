5|$|During the Woodland period, many American Indians in Iowa <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{hunting and}} {{gathering}} and used more domesticated plants, although wild food was still important.

5|$|After the September 11, 2001 attacks, media {{attention}} <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{the company and}} its troubles; a little less than a month later Enron announced its intention {{to begin the process of}} selling its lower-margin assets in favor of its core businesses of gas and electricity trading. This policy included selling Portland General Electric to another Oregon utility, Northwest Natural Gas, for about $1.9 billion in cash and stock, and possibly selling its 65% stake in the Dabhol project in India.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Friedrich was rediscovered by the Norwegian art {{historian}} Andreas Aubert (1851–1913), whose writing initiated modern Friedrich scholarship, and by the Symbolist painters, who valued his visionary and allegorical landscapes. The Norwegian Symbolist Edvard Munch (1863–1944) would have seen Friedrich's work during a visit to Berlin in the 1880s. Munch's 1899 print The Lonely Ones echoes Friedrich's Rückenfigur (back figure), although in Munch's work the focus has <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the broad landscape and toward the sense of dislocation between the two melancholy figures in the foreground.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{remained}} {{active in}} the Democratic party after his 1880 defeat and began stumping on behalf of other candidates and helping to organize party rallies across the state. His speeches were noted for their partisanship, but his rhetoric gradually <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a conservative viewpoint in the 1890s {{as he began to}} identify himself with the growing progressive movement. He {{became a member of the}} state Democratic Central Committee in 1904, a position that raised his popularity and influence in the party.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{invasion}} threat from France had passed and a lasting peace {{was made in}} 1558; government concerns <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the south coast towards the Spanish threat to the south-west of England. By 1569, when Thomas Carew was serving as Hurst's captain, there were less than ten guns but the same size of garrison to that seven years before. His son, Sir Thomas Gorges, became captain in turn, and in 1593 he reported that the castle's gun platforms were in serious need of repair.|$|E
5|$|The 1850s was {{a period}} of {{transition}} for the ice trade. The industry was already quite large: in 1855 around $6–7 million ($118–138 million in 2010 terms) was invested in the industry in the U.S. and an estimated two million tons (two billion kg) of ice was kept in storage at any one time in warehouses across the nation. Over the coming decade, however, the focus of the growing trade <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> relying upon the international export market in favour of supplying first the growing, eastern cities of the US, and then the rest of the rapidly expanding country.|$|E

5|$|The {{threat of}} a French {{invasion}} passed, and peace was declared in 1558. Attention <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Portland, and a 1574 survey reported that the castle was in a poor condition, with similar concerns being repeated in 1583. Tensions with Spain grew and military attention focused on {{the threat to the}} south-west of England. War broke out in 1585, and £228 was spent on renovating Portland Castle. In 1596, the garrison still comprised a captain and 13 men.|$|E
5|$|When {{the report}} was {{submitted}} to the House of Representatives, detractors soon began to speak against it. The notion of programs that resembled British practice were wicked along {{with the power of}} balance being <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Representatives to the executive branch were some of the prejudices that resided within the House. William Maclay suspected that several congressmen were involved in government securities, saw Congress in an unholy league with New York speculators. Congressman James Jackson also spoke against New York, with allegations of speculators attempting to swindle those who had not yet heard about Hamilton's report.|$|E
5|$|Whitepages {{was founded}} in 1997 as a hobby for then-Stanford student Alex Algard. It was {{incorporated}} in 2000 and received $45 million in funding in 2005. Investors were later bought-out by Algard in 2013. From 2008 to 2013, Whitepages released several mobile apps, a re-design in 2009, the ability for consumers to control their contact information, and other features. From 2010 to 2016, the company <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> advertising revenue and began focusing more on selling business services and subscription products.|$|E

This <b>shift</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> hierarchical structures facilitated a political climate which would become The International Women’s Decade 1975-1985. This political movement paved the way for the foundation of women’s studies programs, and in 1985 the elimination of many governmental forms of discrimination against women.|$|R

5|$|Political {{and social}} trends {{of the late}} 1970s <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the early 1970s hippie attitudes that had led to the genre's {{development}} and popularity. The rise in punk cynicism made the utopian ideals expressed in progressive rock lyrics unfashionable. Virtuosity was rejected, as the expense of purchasing quality instruments and the time investment of learning to play them were seen as barriers to rock's energy and immediacy. There were also changes in the music industry, as record companies disappeared and merged into large media conglomerates. Promoting and developing experimental music {{was not part of}} the marketing strategy for these large corporations, who focused their attention on identifying and targeting profitable market niches.|$|E
5|$|Zahir's rule radically {{changed the}} {{landscape}} of Galilee. With the restoration and re-fortification of Acre {{and the establishment of}} the secondary port city of Haifa, Galilee significantly strengthened its ties with the Mediterranean world. Following Zahir's death, his successor Jazzar Pasha maintained the cotton monopoly Zahir had established and Galilee's economy remained almost completely dependent on the cotton trade. The region prospered for decades, but with the rise of the cotton market in the southern United States during the early-mid 19th century, European demand <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Palestine's cotton and because of its dependency on the crop, the region experienced a sharp economic downturn from which it could not recover. The cotton crop was largely abandoned, as were many villages, and the peasantry shifted its focus to subsistence agriculture.|$|E
5|$|By early 1934, {{the focus}} <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> funding work {{creation}} schemes and toward rearmament. By 1935, military expenditures accounted for 73 {{percent of the}} government's purchases of goods and services. On 18 October 1936, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, intended {{to speed up the}} rearmament programme. In addition to calling for the rapid construction of steel mills, synthetic rubber plants and other factories, Göring instituted wage and price controls and restricted the issuance of stock dividends. Large expenditures were made on rearmament in spite of growing deficits. With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the Reichswehr, which had been limited to 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, with a million more in the reserve. By January 1939, unemployment was down to 301,800 and it dropped to only 77,500 by September.|$|E

5|$|Following the Spanish–American War in 1898, this {{aggressive}} interpretation {{was used}} to create a U.S. economic empire across the Caribbean, such as with the 1903 treaty with Cuba that was heavily tilted in the U.S.' favor. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt believed that the U.S. should be the main beneficiary of production in Central America. The U.S. enforced this hegemony with armed interventions in Nicaragua (1912–33), and Haiti (1915–34). The U.S. did not need to use its military might in Guatemala, where a series of dictators were willing to accommodate the economic interests of the U.S. in return for its support for their regimes. Guatemala was among the Central American countries of the period known as a banana republic. From 1890 to 1920, control of Guatemala's resources and its economy <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Britain and Germany to the U.S., which became Guatemala's dominant trade partner. The Monroe Doctrine continued to be seen as relevant to Guatemala, and {{was used to}} justify the coup in 1954.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, more {{administrative}} {{records from}} the period had become available to historians such as William Stubbs, Thomas Tout and J. C. Davies, who focused {{on the development of the}} English constitutional and governmental system during his reign. Although critical of what they regarded as Edward's inadequacies as a king, they also emphasised the growth of the role of parliament and the reduction in personal royal authority under Edward II, which they perceived as positive developments. During the 1970s the historiography of Edward's reign <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> this model, supported by the further publishing of records from the period in the last quarter of the 20th century. The work of Jeffrey Denton, Jeffrey Hamilton, John Maddicott and Seymour Phillips re-focused attention on the role of the individual leaders in the conflicts. With the exceptions of Hilda Johnstone's work on Edward's early years, and Natalie Fryde's study of Edward's final years, the focus of the major historical studies for several years was on the leading magnates rather than Edward himself, until substantial biographies of the King were published by Roy Haines and Seymour Phillips in 2003 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|Connery and Salomon {{eventually}} dropped out, and in September 1995, Robert Rodriguez, {{fresh from}} the success of Desperado, signed to direct with Antonio Banderas, who had also starred in Desperado, playing the title role. TriStar and Amblin had been surprised by Rodriguez's low-budget filming techniques for his action films, El Mariachi and Desperado, and <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> their initial plans with Salomon to make a big-budget version of Zorro. Spielberg had hoped Rodriguez would start filming in January 1996 for a Christmas release date, but the start date was pushed back to July. The release date was later moved to Easter 1997. Rodriguez {{pulled out of the}} film' in June 1996 over difficulties coming to terms with TriStar on the budget. The studio projected a range of $35 million, while Rodriguez wanted $45 million. They both attempted to compromise when Rodriguez lowered it to $42 million, but the studio refused and set $41 million as their highest mark. Banderas remained with the production, and Martin Campbell signed on later that month, turning down the chance to direct Tomorrow Never Dies. The finished screenplay would be written by John Eskow, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, based on a story by Elliott, Rossio, and Randall Jahnson.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} {{was withdrawn}} back to Australia in early 1944 for rest and reorganisation. During this period it was stationed at Tenterfield, where the soldiers experienced a bitterly cold winter, {{before moving to}} Petrie and then Kiari on the Atherton Tablelands. The battalion was reorganised to conform {{with the requirements of}} the jungle divisional establishment, and as a result its vehicles were changed to include jeeps and trailers, instead of trucks, which were considered impractical in the jungle. A change of commanding officer also took place in this time, with Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Haupt– who had previously served as battalion second-in-command before leaving to take over command of the 62nd Battalion in January 1943– returning to take over from Fidock. A long period of training, which included courses in amphibious warfare and various jungle exercises followed, as the focus of the fighting in the Pacific <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Australian forces towards the US military. Consequently, it was not until close {{to the end of the}} war that the battalion went into action again. Before this, the battalion contributed to an Australian contingent that was sent to India to lecture British Army officers on the lessons of jungle warfare.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamics}} of gender inequity are related with the ideological principles {{held by the}} ruling political regime. The imperial era was dominated by the social paradigm of Confucianism, which was a pervasive philosophy throughout the Orient. Confucian ideals emphasized morality, character, social relationship, and the status quo. Confucius preached jen (humanity) and the equality and educability of all people; Neo-Confucianists and Imperial leaders used his beliefs in social hierarchy, particularly in the family setting, for the physical and social oppression of women. As the Chinese government began to re-assimilate themselves into the global community in the late 19th to early 20th century, it <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> conventional Confucian ideals and women's role in society changed as well. After Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China in 1949, a change in traditional gender roles came about. Mao's death {{marked the beginning of}} the current communist administration, and an influx of international communications in the areas of commerce, politics and social ideals. Since the 1980s, under the new communist party, the women's rights movement has gained momentum and has become a national issue as well as a sign of modernization.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown was {{developed}} by Guildford-based video game studio Criterion Games. The studio suffered several setbacks during {{the sequence of events}} that led up to the creation of Burnout 3, including the cancellation of a project, a failed pitch, and a fall out with the game's eventual publisher Electronic Arts (EA). In 2002, Criterion was around 130 people divided into two development teams. One team was working on Burnout 2: Point of Impact, a follow up to Burnout, set to be published by Acclaim Entertainment. The other team had completed the development of the extreme sports game AirBlade for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony had intentions of continuing to collaborate with Criterion on a sequel to AirBlade, however the AirBlade team turned down the offer. Instead, Criterion began talks with EA, who had a proposal for Criterion to create a remake of the 1988 skateboarding video game Skate or Die!. Criterion were keen to work with EA and started development on the project. Following Burnout 2s release, Criterion prepared a pitch to EA Canada about working on a second game with the publisher. Criterion's proposed title was Need For Speed: Split Second, a stunt racing game within EA's Need for Speed series. Meanwhile, the Skate of Die! remake project was thrown into disarray when EA requested changes to the game's design and the creative direction of project <b>shifted</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Criterion's vision. With development staff becoming unhappy and stressed about the project, the studio decided to contact EA and cancel the game. EA was displeased with their decision and {{the relationship between the two}} companies soured, leading to dissolution of the proposed Need for Speed game.|$|E
