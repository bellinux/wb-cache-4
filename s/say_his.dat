5|$|In {{assessing}} {{the work of}} Tkach, there are two points of view. The critics of Tkach, especially those who formed the splinter churches, see Tkach as the key person responsible for {{the collapse of the}} WCG. They believe that the changes he brought were a turn against God and <b>say</b> <b>his</b> rejection of Armstrong's unique doctrines were, at best, without biblical foundation.|$|E
5|$|O'Malley's detractors {{say that}} he was not a visionary for taking {{baseball}} west. They say the game was naturally heading toward geographical expansion and O'Malley just an opportunist.

5|$|Born William fitzHerbert in York, William {{was the son}} of Herbert of Winchester, or Herbert fitzAlberic, {{chancellor}} and {{treasurer of}} King Henry I. Most sources <b>say</b> <b>his</b> mother was Emma, half-sister of King Stephen and Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and that she was an illegitimate daughter of Stephen II, Count of Blois, Stephen's father. New research, however, suggests that Emma might have been a daughter of Hunger fitzOdin, who held lands in Dorset in the Domesday survey. William was born sometime before the 1090s, but the exact date of birth is unknown.|$|E

As the day progresses, he tries to have an {{individual}} goodbye with each employee. A phone call with Holly reveals that this is his last day, and he is flying out to Colorado that night. After having a few mini-crises, including getting cold feet, he starts to break down, but regains his composure after speaking with Holly.

5|$|The first {{studies of}} the Javan {{rhinoceros}} by naturalists from outside of its region took place in 1787, when two animals were shot in Java. The skulls {{were sent to the}} renowned Dutch naturalist Petrus Camper, who died in 1789 before he was able to publish his discovery that the rhinos of Java were a distinct species. Another Javan rhinoceros was shot on the island of Sumatra by Alfred Duvaucel, who sent the specimen to his stepfather Georges Cuvier, the famous French scientist. Cuvier recognized the animal as a distinct species in 1822, and in the same year it was identified by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest as Rhinoceros sondaicus. It was the last species of rhinoceros to be identified. Desmarest initially identified the rhino as being from Sumatra, but later amended this to <b>say</b> <b>his</b> specimen was from Java.|$|E

In any case, he was unconscious when being drawn and quartered.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{disagree}} about who taught Pythagoras {{due to an}} absence of reliable information.

Thus, we find mentioned as his instructors , or his father Creophylus of Samos (who both stand for a domestic rhapsodic tradition of Samos, competing with Homer's more renowned), Bias of Priene, Thales, Anaximander (a pupil of Thales), and Pherecydes of Syros (all exponents of the Greek philosophical tradition). Of the various claims regarding his Greek teachers, Pherecydes of Syros is mentioned most often.|$|E
