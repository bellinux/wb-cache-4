5|$|Early in 1942 Cardus {{rented a}} small flat in the Kings Cross {{district}} of Sydney, where {{he wrote his}} Ten Composers (1945) and Autobiography (1947). He <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> he found the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult at first, but that the process had turned him from a journalist into something more substantial. When later in 1942 his wife announced her intention of sailing from England to join him, Cardus declined {{to move to a}} larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a mile away. They dined together once a week, but otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.|$|E
5|$|She {{moved to}} Los Angeles and quickly secured {{a role in}} Dawson's Creek. Williams <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> she thought she knew all she needed to know since age15. She said in 2011 that she chose {{emancipation}} as she was influenced by other young actors doing it. In 1997, unhappy with the roles they were being offered, Williams and several actor friends wrote a script entitled Blink. It was sold, but nothing happened with it.|$|E
5|$|This too {{was intercepted}} and photographed but, {{as it was}} a {{relatively}} harmless letter, it was forwarded on while the British authorities continued to monitor Lody's communications in the hope of finding out more about the German espionage network. The day after sending it, on 15 September, Lody travelled to London to reconnoitre the city's war preparations. Travelling light, he stayed for two nights at the Ivanhoe Hotel in Bloomsbury (now the Bloomsbury Street Hotel) and set to work finding information about the security measures at public buildings. He <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> he had not actually observed the buildings himself but had obtained cuttings from newspapers, which he intended to send to Berlin. He also wrote a report on 16 September, but claimed that he had never sent it– it was never found by the British– as he felt that it was poorly written.|$|E

5|$|Vrba's {{marriage}} ended {{around this}} time. In 1958 {{he received an}} invitation to an international conference in Israel, and while there he defected. He worked {{for the next two}} years at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. He <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> he could not continue to live in Israel because the same men who had, in his view, betrayed the Jewish community in Hungary were now in positions of power there. In 1960 he moved instead to England, where he worked for two years in the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton, Surrey, and seven years for the Medical Research Council. He became a British subject by naturalization on 4 August 1966.|$|E
5|$|Following {{news of his}} father's {{premature}} death in 1864, Riel lost interest in the priesthood and he withdrew from the college in March 1865. For a time he continued his studies as a day student in the convent of the Grey Nuns, but was soon asked to leave following breaches of discipline. He remained in Montreal over a year, living {{at the home of}} his aunt, Lucie Riel. Impoverished by the death of his father, Riel took employment as a law clerk in the Montreal office of Rodolphe Laflamme. During this time he was involved in a failed romance with a young woman named Marie–Julie Guernon. This progressed to the point of Riel having signed a contract of marriage, but his fiancée's family opposed her involvement with a Métis, and the engagement was soon broken. Compounding this disappointment, Riel found legal work unpleasant, and by early 1866 he had resolved to leave Canada East. Some of his friends <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> he worked odd jobs in Chicago, Illinois, while staying with poet Louis-Honoré Fréchette, and wrote poems himself in the manner of Lamartine; also that he was then for a time employed as a clerk in Saint Paul, Minnesota, before returning to the Red River Settlement on 26 July 1868.|$|E
5|$|To {{communicate}} with his handlers, Lody {{was instructed to}} write to certain addresses in Christiania (now Oslo), Stockholm, New York City and Rome. He acquired an American emergency passport {{in the name of}} Charles A.Inglis, a genuine document obtained from the US Embassy in Berlin. When Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August, newly imposed restrictions prevented foreigners from leaving Germany without travel documents. Embassies and consulates throughout the country experienced a rush of visitors as foreigners sought emergency passports; these had to be submitted to the German Foreign Ministry to obtain exit permits for neutral Denmark or the Netherlands. One such applicant was the real Charles A. Inglis, whose passport went missing– lost, it was claimed, although in fact the Foreign Ministry had appropriated it for Lody's use. As the passport lacked security features such as the holder's photograph or fingerprints, being merely a single-sheet document, it was well-suited for use by a spy. Lody <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> he had received it in the post from his superiors atN. He was also given £250 in British banknotes, 1,000 Danish krone and 1,000 Norwegian krone to finance his mission to the UK, where he would travel via Denmark and Norway.|$|E
2500|$|Marleau was {{defeated}} by New Democratic Party candidate Glenn Thibeault in the 2008 federal election. [...] She <b>later</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> comments made by Sudbury Member of Provincial Parliament Rick Bartolucci shortly before election day played a [...] "crucial" [...] role in her defeat. [...] Marleau <b>later</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> she would probably not seek re-election to the House of Commons.|$|R

25|$|About 150 {{people were}} present. Jean-Baptiste Estrade (a tax inspector), Duffo (a court official), and the {{officers}} from the garrison were present. Soubirous <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> the lady had told her a secret, which was only for her alone; this secret was never revealed to anyone.|$|E
25|$|During 1948, Amazing Stories ceased all {{publication}} of Shaver's stories. Palmer would later claim {{the magazine was}} pressured by sinister outside forces to make the change: science fiction fans would credit their boycott and letter-writing campaigns for the change. The magazine's owners <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> the Shaver Mystery had simply run its course and sales were decreasing.|$|E
25|$|Divers {{scoured the}} cave, looking in every small crevice and fissure where Ben might have crawled in a panicked {{attempt to get}} out as his tanks ran low, a pattern found in other cave diving deaths; many <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> they felt they had risked their own lives to do so. But over the ensuing weekend they found no sign of Ben.|$|E

25|$|The SO19 {{firearms}} officers {{involved in}} the shooting were debriefed and drugs and alcohol tests were taken as a standard procedure. The officers were taken off duty pending {{an investigation into the}} shooting. One security agency source <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> members of SO19 received training from the SAS. He said the operation was not typical of the police, and bore the hallmarks of a special forces operation.|$|E
25|$|Ignoring the haka is {{a tactic}} {{sometimes}} used by opposing teams. Famously, the Australian rugby team did a warm up drill {{well away from}} the All Blacks during their 1996 test match in Wellington. More recently, the Italian rugby team ignored the haka during a 2007 World Cup Pool Match. All Black team member, Keven Mealamu, <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> in his opinion the snub had backfired and provided motivation to his team.|$|E
25|$|Buse was accorded {{a benefit}} match by Somerset {{in his final}} {{first-class}} season, 1953, and picked the three-day County Championship game against Lancashire at Bath. The match was a sensation, though not to Buse's gain. At {{the root of the}} sensation was a newly-laid pitch, which took vicious spin from the start of play. Lancashire's acting captain, the England Test batsman Cyril Washbrook, <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> Lancashire would have refused to play had it not been a benefit match.|$|E

50|$|Henry sent Collins to Muir {{to brief}} him on {{fingerprinting}} technique for four days.

25|$|Ewbank {{moved back}} to Oxford in {{retirement}} and wrote a book in 1977 called Football Greats. He {{was inducted into the}} Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> year that he was glad to be out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent.|$|E
25|$|Goldwater {{remained}} {{popular in}} Arizona, {{and in the}} 1968 Senate election he was elected (this time) to the seat of retiring Senator Carl Hayden. He was subsequently reelected in 1974 and 1980. The 1974 election saw Goldwater easily reelected over his Democratic opponent, Jonathan Marshall, the publisher of The Scottsdale Progress. His final campaign in 1980 was close, with Goldwater winning in a near draw against Democratic challenger Bill Schulz. Goldwater <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> the close result convinced him not to run again.|$|E
25|$|This win {{came just}} a week after his {{surprise}} victory with A. J. Foyt at 24 hours of Le Mans, where Gurney spontaneously began the now-familiar winner's tradition of spraying champagne from the podium to celebrate the unexpected win against the Ferraris and the other Ford GT40 teams. Gurney <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> he took great satisfaction in proving wrong the critics (including {{some members of the}} Ford team) who predicted the two great drivers, normally heated rivals, would break their car in an effort to show each other up.|$|E

25|$|As Virgil's {{train was}} {{pulling out of}} Tucson {{on its way to}} California, gunfire was heard. Witnesses gave {{contradictory}} accounts about the number of men seen near the tracks and numbers of shots fired. Some said the Earps were armed after leaving Porter's Hotel and others said they were not. Witnesses saw men running with weapons but could not identify anyone in the dark. Wyatt <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> he and his deputies spotted Frank Stilwell and another man he believed to be Ike Clanton armed with shotguns lying on a flatcar.|$|E
25|$|Following Politico's {{reporting}} on the matter, Price {{said that he would}} stop taking taxpayer-funded private jet flights pending a formal review by his department's inspector general. President Trump said that he was unhappy about Price's expenditures, but declined to state whether he would fire him. Price <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> September that he would reimburse taxpayers for $51,887, which he calculated as the cost of his seat on the more than $400,000 worth of charter flights. He also vowed to discontinue the use of private charter flights for his travel. Later that day, it was revealed that the expenditures for Price's charter and military flights were higher than $1 million, including flights taken by Secretary Price and his wife to Europe and Africa. Politico also noted that Price had, in June 2017, defended a proposal to cut $663,000 from HHS's $4.9 million annual travel budget.|$|E
25|$|These events {{damaged the}} summer tourist custom to the railway, the towns served, {{and the area}} as a whole. A {{spokesman}} announced on 22 June that the line was expected to reopen between Bewdley and Arley {{by the end of}} July and the section between Bridgnorth and Hampton Loade to be up and running by the end of August; however it became apparent in early July 2007 that these reopenings would be delayed by as much as a month, later extended to up to three months. On 19 July, another torrential storm caused further wreckage in at least 45 separate locations as rain fell on the already saturated ground, and at least ten of these spots damage was so serious major engineering work was required before reconstruction could get under way. It was also <b>said</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> the crucial link between Hampton Loade and Arley, including Highley station and the new Engine House museum, would probably not open until as late as Spring 2008.|$|E
