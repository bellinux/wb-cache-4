5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (<b>superhet),</b> invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E

25|$|A {{superheterodyne}} receiver, often shortened to <b>superhet,</b> {{is a type}} {{of radio}} receiver that uses frequency mixing to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) which can be more conveniently processed than the original carrier frequency. It was invented by US engineer Edwin Armstrong in 1918 during World War I. Virtually all modern radio receivers use the superheterodyne principle.|$|E
25|$|In early <b>superhets,</b> the IF {{stage was}} often a {{regenerative}} stage providing the sensitivity and selectivity with fewer components. Such <b>superhets</b> were called super-gainers or regenerodynes.|$|R

2500|$|Anderson {{had been}} a fan of Radiohead's music and was {{impressed}} with Jonny Greenwood's scoring of the film Bodysong. While writing the script for There Will Be Blood, Anderson heard Greenwood's orchestral piece [...] "Popcorn <b>Superhet</b> Receiver", which prompted him to ask Greenwood to work with him. After initially agreeing to score the film, Greenwood had doubts and thought about backing out, but Anderson's reassurance and enthusiasm for the film convinced him to stick with it. Anderson gave Greenwood a copy of the film and three weeks later he came back with two hours of music recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. Concerning his approach to composing the soundtrack, Greenwood said to Entertainment Weekly: ...|$|E
25|$|Early Autodyne {{receivers}} {{typically used}} IFs of only 150nbsp&kHz or so, {{as it was}} difficult to maintain reliable oscillation if higher frequencies were used. As a consequence, most Autodyne receivers needed quite elaborate antenna tuning networks, often involving double-tuned coils, to avoid image interference. Later <b>superhets</b> used tubes especially designed for oscillator/mixer use, which were able to work reliably with much higher IFs, reducing the problem of image interference and so allowing simpler and cheaper aerial tuning circuitry.|$|R
25|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{have essentially}} replaced all previous receiver designs. The development of modern semiconductor electronics negated {{the advantages of}} designs (such as the regenerative receiver) that used fewer vacuum tubes. The superheterodyne receiver offers superior sensitivity, frequency stability and selectivity. Compared with the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) design, <b>superhets</b> offer better stability because a tuneable oscillator is more easily realized than a tuneable amplifier. Operating at a lower frequency, IF filters can give narrower passbands at the same Q factor than an equivalent RF filter. A fixed IF also allows {{the use of a}} crystal filter or similar technologies that cannot be tuned. Regenerative and super-regenerative receivers offered a high sensitivity, but often suffer from stability problems making them difficult to operate.|$|R
5000|$|Hazeltine's {{innovation}} was to add {{a circuit}} to each radio frequency amplifier stage which fed back {{a small amount of}} energy from the plate (output) circuit to the grid (input) circuit with opposite phase to cancel ("neutralize") the feedback which was causing the oscillation. This effectively prevented the high-pitched squeals that had plagued early radio sets. A group of more than 20 companies known as the Independent Radio Manufacturers Association licensed the circuit from Hazeltine and manufactured [...] "Neutrodyne" [...] receivers throughout the 1920s. [...] At the time, RCA held a virtual monopoly over commercial radio receiver production due to its ownership of the rights to the Armstrong regenerative and superheterodyne circuits. The Neutrodyne ended this control, allowing competition. Compared to the technically superior superheterodyne the Neutrodyne was cheaper to build. As basically a TRF receiver, it was also considered easier for non-technical owners to use than the early <b>superhets.</b> After manufacture each tuned amplifier stage had to be neutralized, adjusted to cancel feedback; after this the set would not produce the parasitic oscillations which caused the objectionable noises. By 1927 some ten million of these receivers had been sold to consumers in North America.|$|R
2500|$|In March 1936, the Hammarlund Manufacturing Company {{initiated}} {{the first of}} the famous “Super-Pro” line, the SP-10 receiver, followed in January 1937 by the SP-100. Their efforts to improve the design resulted in October 1939 with the SP-200 series, an 18-tube, single conversion <b>superhet</b> receiver. The SP-200 series Super-Pro receivers were manufactured through 1945, with thousands delivered to the military during World War II; they saw wide use by the U.S. Signal Corps as the BC-779. During World War II, government agencies like the FBI used the 200 Series Super-Pro at their listening posts. [...] Many were used at ground stations in England to communicate with the Royal Air Force and U.S. Air Force armadas that flew bombing missions over Germany. According to a November 1940 QST Magazine ad, [...] "The fact that 'Super-Pro' receivers are used extensively by the U.S. Signal Corps and many other governmental departments, speaks for itself." [...] At the end of the war, the market was flooded with surplus Super-Pro receivers at bargain prices, which may be a reason many working examples of this model are still found today. From 1946 to 1948, Hammarlund produced the SP-400 Super Pro for the amateur radio market. In 1947 the SP-600 Super-Pro receiver, which surpassed the SP-200 in performance, was introduced. The SP-600 series were widely used throughout the world for military, laboratory and commercial application.|$|E

5000|$|In the era {{of early}} radio, only RCA and a select number of {{competing}} [...] "prestige" [...] radio manufacturers could afford to build a superheterodyne receiver (<b>superhet).</b> The RCA Corporation had exclusive rights to the superheterodyne circuit patents and extracted high licensing fees from other companies who sought to build <b>superhet</b> sets. RCA also vigorously prosecuted patent infringers. This situation tended to propel RCA into the forefront of radio manufacturers in the 1920s due to the higher efficiency of the <b>superhet</b> circuit- a situation which lasted until the patents expired in the early 1930s, at which time a flood of low-cost superheterodyne receivers hit the marketplace. Early (RCA-patent-era) superhets were often used with the relatively expensive moving coil speakers, which offer a quality of sound unavailable from moving iron speakers.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} and widely used {{application of the}} heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (<b>superhet),</b> which was invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918.

50|$|Since most radio {{receivers}} {{are of the}} <b>superhet</b> design, they typically contain local oscillators which generate a radio frequency signal {{in the range of}} 455 kHz above or sometimes below the frequency to be received. There is always some radiation from such receivers, and in the initial stages of RAFTER, MI5 simply attempted to locate clandestine receivers based on picking up the <b>superhet</b> signal with a quite sensitive receiver that was custom built. This was not always easy because of the increasing number of domestic radios and televisions in people's homes.|$|E

50|$|They {{are also}} {{often used in}} digital receivers, and are well suited to <b>superhet</b> applications. This is because the {{intermediate}} frequency signal is always at a fixed frequency after the local oscillator has been mixed with the received signal, and so a filter with a fixed frequency and high Q provides excellent removal of unwanted or interference signals.|$|E
