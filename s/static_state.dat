We apply the numerical path-following technique to solve for the curve connecting the <b>static</b> <b>states.</b> We demonstrate that device models with 2 DOF can already exhibit symmetry-breaking bifurcations in the curve of <b>static</b> <b>states</b> and can have multiple disjoint solution paths. These features are also found in a finite-element method (FEM) model for a flexible beam suspended by a torsion spring. We have observed multiple hysteresis loops in measurements of a capacitive RF-MEMS device and have captured the qualitative features of these measurements in a model with 5 DOF. Numerical procedures for determining stability of solutions and finding bifurcation points are provided.

40|$|We {{examine the}} Einstein {{equation}} coupled to the Klein-Gordon equation for a complex-valued scalar field. These two equations together {{are known as}} the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system. In the low-field, non-relativistic limit, the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system reduces to the Poisson-Schrödinger system. We describe the simplest solutions of these systems in spherical symmetry, the spherically symmetric <b>static</b> <b>states,</b> and some scaling properties they obey. We also describe some approximate analytic solutions for these states. The EKG system underlies a theory of wave dark matter, also known as scalar field dark matter (SFDM), boson star dark matter, and Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) dark matter. We discuss a possible connection between the theory of wave dark matter and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, which is a scaling relation observed to hold for disk galaxies in the universe across many decades in mass. We show how fixing boundary conditions {{at the edge of}} the spherically symmetric <b>static</b> <b>states</b> implies Tully-Fisher-like relations for the states. We also catalog other "scaling conditions" one can impose on the <b>static</b> <b>states</b> and show that they do not lead to Tully-Fisher-like relations [...] barring one exception which is already known and which has nothing to do with the specifics of wave dark matter.

40|$|We {{study the}} fate of the 2 d kinetic q-state Potts model after a sudden quench to zero temperature. Both ground <b>states</b> and {{complicated}} <b>static</b> <b>states</b> are reached with non-zero probabilities. These outcomes resemble those found in the quench of the 2 d Ising model; however, the variety of <b>static</b> <b>states</b> in the q-state Potts model (with q>= 3) is much richer than in the Ising model, where <b>static</b> <b>states</b> are either ground or stripe states. Another possibility is that the system gets trapped on a set of equal-energy blinker states where a subset of spins can flip ad infinitum; these states are similar to those found in the quench of the 3 d Ising model. The evolution towards the final energy is also unusual [...] -at long times, sudden and massive energy drops may occur that are accompanied by macroscopic reordering of the domain structure. This indeterminacy in the zero-temperature quench of the kinetic Potts model is at odds with basic predictions from the theory of phase-ordering kinetics. We also propose a continuum description of coarsening with more than two equivalent ground states. The resulting time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations reproduce the complex cluster patterns that arise in the quench of the kinetic Potts model.

40|$|The {{particle}} filter (PF) {{has emerged as}} a powerful tool for solving nonlinear and/or non-Gaussian filtering problems. When some of the states enter the model linearly, this can be exploited by using particles only for the "nonlinear" states and employing conditional Kalman filters for the "linear" states; this leads to the Rao-Blackwellised {{particle filter}} (RBPF). However, {{it is well known that}} the PF fails when the state of the model contains some static parameter. This is true also for the RBPF, even if the <b>static</b> <b>states</b> are marginalised analytically by a Kalman filter. The reason is that the posterior density of the <b>static</b> <b>states</b> is computed conditioned on the nonlinear particle trajectories, which are bound to degenerate over time. To circumvent this problem, we propose a method for targeting the posterior parameter density, conditioned on just the current nonlinear state. This results in an RBPF-like method, capable of recursive identification of nonlinear dynamical models with affine parameter dependencies...|$|R

These considerations clearly demonstrate that a deep connection exists between <b>static</b> <b>states,</b> cosmologies and waves.

40|$|Abstract—As {{electricity}} demand {{continues to grow}} and renewable energy increases its penetration in the power grid, realtime state tracking becomes essential for system monitoring and control. Recent developments in phasor technology make realtime dynamic state estimation possible with high-speed timesynchronized data provided by synchronized Phasor Measurement Units (PMU). In this paper we present a two-stage Kalman filtering approach to estimate the <b>static</b> <b>states</b> of voltage magnitudes and phase angles, {{as well as the}} dynamic states of generator rotor angles and generator speeds. Kalman filters achieve optimal performance only when the system noise characteristics have known statistical properties (zero-mean, Gaussian, and spectrally white). However in practice the process and measurement noise models are usually difficult to obtain. Thus in the first stage, we estimate the <b>static</b> <b>states</b> from raw PMU measurements, using a lightweight but efficient adaptive Kalman filtering algorithm called Adaptive Kalman Filter with Inflatable Noise Variances (AKF with InNoVa), which can identify and reduce the impact of incorrect system modeling and/or bad PMU measurements. In the next stage, the estimated bus voltages are fed into an extended Kalman filter to obtain the dynamic state estimations. Simulations demonstrate its robustness to sudden changes of system dynamics and erroneous PMU measurements.

Hence in this study we assessed the impact of the environmental milieu on Candida biofilm formation using polystyrene, flat-bottomed 96 -well microtiter plates. A total of 20, comprising 10 clinical isolates each of Candida albicans and, non-albicans species of Candida were compared for their biofilm forming ability both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and static and dynamic conditions. XTT reduction assay was used to quantify the sessile growth. Biofilm formation of all 10 C. albicans isolates differed significantly between dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>states</b> under both atmospheric conditions (P < 0. 05). For non-albicans Candida species, a significant difference in biofilm growth between dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>states</b> was noted only when incubated aerobically (P < 0. 05), and no significant difference in biofilm formation was noted between aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that C. albicans produced a compact multilayered biofilm embedded in noticeably higher quantity of extracellular polymeric matrix in aerobic/dynamic conditions compared with anaerobic/static conditions. Our data indicate that biofilm formation of C. albicans and non-albicans Candida species is modulated by hydrodynamic conditions and ambient oxygen gradients.
