50|$|Speech Transmission Index (STI) is {{a measure}} of <b>speech</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>quality.</b> The {{absolute}} measurement of speech intelligibility is a complex science. The STI measures some physical characteristics of a transmission channel (a room, electro-acoustic equipment, telephone line, etc.), and expresses the ability of the channel to carry across the characteristics of a speech signal. STI is a well-established objective measurement predictor of how the characteristics of the transmission channel affect speech intelligibility.|$|E
40|$|This {{appendix}} introduces {{contours of}} <b>speech</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>quality</b> (or contours of user satisfaction) {{that can be}} used to predict <b>speech</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>quality</b> from time-varying transmission impairments. Quality contours are derived from the ITU-T E-model [ITU-T G. 107] upon reducing it to the transport layer only (i. e., with assumed default values characterizing perfect terminals). The shape of quality contours is determined by the Delay Impairment Idd that covers loss of interactivity and the Effective Equipment Impairment Ie-eff that covers information loss due to encoding scheme and packet loss. The proposed quality contours determine the rating factor R for all possible combinations of packet loss (assuming a given encoding scheme) and mouth-to-ear delay (assuming echo-free connections). Quality contours can be used in cross-layer optimization of various communications layers (e. g., adaptive playout scheduling at the application layer, traffic differentiation at the MAC layer) when predicting end-to-end <b>speech</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>quality</b> from time-varying transmission impairments...|$|E

It uses non-intrusive speech quality measurements on live speech calls. The basic idea behind this analysis is an expectation that the average call duration is higher for calls of a good quality since users are less disturbed during their conversation by transmission impairments. Both traditional and state of the art methods for non-intrusive <b>speech</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>quality</b> measurements and also for call duration monitoring are briefly described and two basic ways of the dependency analysis are shown. The relations for result uncertainty estimation are derived. A numerical example is given based on a limited training database that is constructed on the basis of real network data. Finally, potential applications are presented and discussed. The first results indicate that in the low to medium quality range (Mean Opinion Scores between 1 and 3) the call duration increases with increasing speech quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} ideal time-frequency masking (ITFM) on the intel-ligibility of reverberated speech is tested using {{objective}} mea-surement, namely STI and PESQ scores. The best choice of ITFM threshold is determined {{for a range}} of reverberation times (RTs). Four existing dereverberation algorithms are also as-sessed. Objective test results and informal subjective listen-ing show that IFTM provides great intelligibility improvement for all RTs and outperforms the existing dereverberation algo-rithms, one of which assumes perfect knowledge of the room impulse response. While ITFM provides only a best possible performance bound, our results demonstrate the potential im-provement that could be obtained using time-frequency mask-ing for speech dereverberation.

40|$|Speech {{communications}} over ATM networks {{is one of}} {{the important}} issues in the broadband ISDN. Although CCITT Study Group XIII has already proposed the Draft Recommendation I. 121 on speech communications over broadband ISDN, there are many open issued to be further studied before the effective deployment of speech communications over broadband ISDN can take place. In this thesis, several issues on speech transmission over ATM network have been studied, such as packetization delay, network queuing delay, digital speech encoding algorithms and PVR algorithm. A packetized speech emulation device is proposed to provide the capability of subjective <b>speech</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation over ATM network or other kind of packetized network. The boundary of <b>speech</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>quality</b> degradation that human hearing can tolerate against information loss rate, delay fluctuation and encoding mechanism are found through emulation. The echo effect in ATM network, which is a primary issue in speech communications is also discussed in the thesis. In particular, the emphasis is given to the specification, design and implementation of ATM speech emulator which consists of two subsystems: ATM Network Simulator (ATMNS) and Speech Transmission Emulator (STE). ATMNS has been specified according to the results of ATM network performance analysis, and STE is based on ATM specifications recommended by CCITT. A prototype of the emulator has been implemented on a personal computer and DSP 5600 development system with a special designed audio interface to interconnect phone sets to the DSP 5600 AD input. The software had been written in "C" and DSP assembly language. Subjective evaluation are conducted in terms of the following factors: Cell discarding rate, different network queuing delay and fluctuation to different PVR algorithms. These factors are basic issues which may affect ATM <b>speech</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>quality</b> in an ATM network. Finally, test results under different network conditions are given...|$|E

40|$|Telephone calls routed via {{satellite}} involve long transmission paths which in rurn require significant trans-mission times {{even at the}} speed of light. This transmission time produces a delay in <b>speech</b> <b>transmission</b> of about 0. 3 seconds in each direction for a synchronous satellite. Although the delay itself is not usuaIIy noticed by the talkers, it significantly increases the disturbing effects of echo and mutilation of speech by the echo suppressors so that the overall quality of the circuit, as judged by the users, sufers. The advent of satellite telephoning has brought with it some interesting and challenging questions about the measurement of telephone <b>transmission</b> <b>quality.</b> The traditional measures of voice circuit quality of signal-to-noise ratio, bandwidth, dis-tortion, etc., are not adequate to fully evaluate this new type of circuit.

40|$|In this book, <b>speech</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>quality</b> {{is modeled}} {{on the basis of}} perceptual dimensions. The author {{identifies}} those dimensions that are relevant for today's public-switched and packet-based telecommunication systems, regarding the complete transmission path {{from the mouth of the}} speaker to the ear of the listener. Both narrowband (300 - 3400 Hz) as well as wideband (50 - 7000 Hz) speech transmission is taken into account. A new analytical assessment method is presented that allows the dimensions to be rated by non-expert listeners in a direct way. Due to the efficiency of the test method, a relatively large number of stimuli can be assessed in auditory tests. The test method is applied in two auditory experiments. The book gives the evidence that this test method provides meaningful and reliable results. The resulting dimension scores together with respective overall quality ratings form the basis for a new parametric model for the quality estimation of transmitted speech based on the perceptual dimensions. In a two-step model approach, instrumental dimension models estimate dimension impairment factors in a first step. The resulting dimension estimates are combined by a Euclidean integration function in a second step in order to provide an estimate of the total impairment...|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{quality of}} speech {{is based on}} the "Speech Transmission Index" (STI). While stipulated minimum values for STI exists for office environments in Norway, there are no such {{criteria}} for educational facilities such as classrooms {{at the time of this}} writing. In this paper STI values are measured in twenty classrooms from ten different schools in the Oslo area. The measurements were performed after hours and without pupils present in the room. Background noise, reverberation time, and STI were measured according to current measurement guidelines. These classrooms are all from schools built according to the technical regulations known as TEK 10, which refers to NS 8175 : 2012. This regulation stipulates criteria for maximum level of background noise and reverberation time, but not for <b>speech</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>quality.</b> This paper seeks to find out which STI values one might expect from a given classroom built after these technical regulations. The STI results are interpreted in their relationship with background noise, reverberation time, room geometry and reflecting surfaces to determine if there are correlations between any of these variables. The measurements did not show any significant correlation between background noise and STI, but there were some correlation between STI and average room reverberation time, especially reverberation time in the higher frequency bands (2000 - 8000 Hz). In the control measurements in the two classrooms with pupils present during the day, the STI values dropped due to increased background noise, but also reduced reverberation time, compared with the measurements executed in the same rooms without pupils present in the evening. These results indicate that the correlation between STI values and background noise/reverberation time is not sufficiently stable to have a predictive quality. Based on the findings in this paper, including minimum values for STI in the regulations for educational facilities is highly recommended...|$|E
