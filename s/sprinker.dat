5000|$|Egbert Jannink {{set up his}} factory {{on another}} site in 1810. It {{expanded}} and moved to this site in the Roombek neighbourhood, next to the stream in 1900. The fireproof mill was designed and built by Sidney Stott. There were 70 fireproof textile mills were constructed in Twente between 1880 and 1914. Sidney the Oldham architect, not to be confursed with his cousins Stott and Sons was a millwright who cooperated with most advanced textile machine manufacturers: the mill was handed over complete with power source, line shafting and all the spinning machines needed to spin cotton. The building was modelled on similar double-mills in Lancashire. A central tower housed the engine and the water tank for the <b>sprinkers,</b> either side were the three storey mills with the large uninterrupted floors needed for mule spinning. The height of the chimney was determined by up-draught needed by the boilers. The factory operated until 1967. It is a Rijksmonument (listed building) The building was refurbished from 1975. [...] The Jannink museum moved into the ground floor in 1980, other floors were converted into housing.|$|R

40|$|Citrus {{production}} in Texas {{is concentrated in}} the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV). This area {{is well known for}} its high quality horticultural crops due to the close proximity to the Rio Grande River and climate. The majori-ty of citrus groves are irrigated in this region using traditional flood (TFd) irrigation practices. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare an alternative form of flood irrigation practice called border flood (BFd) that channels water faster down the tree row. In this research study, water was metered to evaluate total water applied in a replicated field study comparing TFd water use to that of BFd. The water savings results observed in this research study were very similar to on-farm demonstration investigations of water use comparing TFd and BFd irrigators. It was found that using BFd irrigation method saved about 36 % of water compared to TFd irrigation practices. This amount of water savings is nearly equivalent to the amount of water saved by current growers using more expen-sive drip and microjet <b>sprinkers</b> systems. The results of this study suggest that citrus growers can implement mod-est changes to their cultural practices by raising berms between rows and, in turn, save water...|$|R

Worse still Percy Barnes of The Age reported that he had overheard the MCG <b>sprinkers</b> during the night. Frank Tyson reckoned that"had he not acted there can be little doubt that there would have been hardly any wicket left on the Monday". An official enquiry by the Victorian Cricket Association and the Melbourne Cricket Club denied any watering of the playing area during the match and claimed that the wicket must have sweated under the tarpaulin despite the baking heat and dry wind. Some scientists theorised that the dry weather drew up water from underground and the wicket watered itself, but a Sydney reporter asked [...] "has anyone worked out how the wicket rolled itself out to close up all those cracks". Wisden stated [...] "large cracks were evident on Saturday yet on Monday these had closed and for a time the surface behaved more kindly to batsmen". Fortunately as England were due to bat Hutton thought he gained from the incident and did not complain, but Ian Johnson said [...] "It was like losing the toss twice over". The proof of the pudding wicket was that Len Maddocks (47), Ian Johnson (33 not out) and Bill Johnston (11) added another 50 runs before Statham (5/60) finished off the innings, the first time he had taken five wickets in a Test innings.|$|R

The magazine was oriented toward publishing avant garde fiction, poetry, and graphic work. From 1982, edited by Fred Pfeil and Michael <b>Sprinker,</b> it began to acquire the Marxist overtones and emphasis on literary theory for which it would later be known. Under the editorship of Jeffrey Williams, it moved from out-and-out Marxism to politically conscious cultural studies.|$|E

In the garage of his Salem, Oregon home, Brudos kept trophies from his victims, expressly two pairs of amputated breasts that were used as paperweights and the left foot of a 19-year-old woman named Linda Slawson (his first murder victim) which he used to model the shoes he collected. After committing a murder, he would dress up in high heels and masturbate. Police investigation and interviews of local university students led them to Brudos, who described the murders in detail. He had confessed to murdering Linda Slawson, Jan Whitney, Karen <b>Sprinker</b> and Linda Salee, {{and was sentenced to}} life in prison.|$|E

40|$|Background: Toxoplasma gondii is {{the causal}} agent of {{toxoplasmosis}} {{in which one}} third of the world’s population has been infected. In pregnant women, it may cause abortion and severe damage to the fetal central nervous system. During pregnancy, the prevalence of toxoplasmosis increases throughout the second and third quarter of gestation, simultaneously progesterone and 17 β-estradiol also increase. Thus, {{it has been suggested that}} these hormones can aggravate or reduce parasite reproduction. The aim of this study was reviewing the relationship between hormones and infection caused by T. gondii in several experimental animal models and humans, focused mainly on: a) congenital transmission, b) parasite reproduction, c) strain virulence, d) levels of hormone in host induced by T. gondii infection and e) participation of hormone receptors in Toxoplasma gondii infection. Are the hormones specific modulators of T. gondii infection?A systematic review methodology was used to consult several databases (Pub Med, Lilacs, Medline, Science direct, Scielo, Ebsco, <b>Sprinker,</b> Wiley and Google Scholar) dated from September, 2013 to March, 2014. Results: 30 studies were included; eight studies in humans and 22 in animals and cell cultures. In the human studies, the most studied hormones were testosterone, progesterone, prolactin and 17 -ß estradiol. Type I (RH and BK) and Type II (Prugniaud, SC, ME 49,T 45, P 78 and T 38) were the most frequent experimental strains. Conclusions: Thirty-five years have passed since the first studies regarding Toxoplasma gondii infection and its relationship with hormones. This systematic review suggests that hormones modulate Toxoplasma gondii infection in different animal models. However, given that data were not comparable, further studies are required to determine the mechanism of hormone action in the Toxoplasma gondii infectious process...|$|E
