Gollum slipped away and visited Shelob, planning to feed the Hobbits to her and then get the Ring for himself when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done.</b> When he returned, he found the Hobbits asleep, {{and the sight of}} Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to him, and the opportunity for redemption was lost. Gollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into Shelob's Lair. There, Frodo was stung by the giant spider, taken prisoner by Orcs, and hauled to the Tower of Cirith Ungol.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{descent from}} Puritan John Leavitt, {{founding}} deacon of Old Ship Church, America's oldest in continuous use, Dudley Leavitt was a skeptic. Perhaps {{it was his}} academic and scientific nature, but Leavitt was known throughout the Meredith area for his scoffing at religion. At one session of evening prayer, for instance, Leavitt's wife offered up a fervent prayer that her husband scholar be saved. When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> Leavitt got up, put on his hat and said [...] "We read in God's word, that the unbelieving husband shall be justified by the prayers of the believing wife," [...] and marched out of the church.|$|E

When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> she asked her husband: [...] "You would do that now, wouldn't you Gerry?" [...] The interview was nearing its finish when he realised what was happening after hearing his crew laughing in the Montrose control room. An embarrassed Ryan informed his listeners: [...] "This is my wife talking".|$|E
2500|$|Abramović had {{proposed}} some solo performances during her career that never were performed. One proposal was titled [...] "Come to Wash with Me." [...] This performance {{would take place}} in a gallery space that was to be transformed into a laundry with sinks placed all around the walls of the gallery. The public would enter the space and be asked to take off all of their clothes and give them to Abramović. The individuals would then wait around as she would wash, dry and iron their cloths for them, and once <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> she would give them back their clothing, and they could get dressed and then leave. She proposed this in 1969 for the Galerija Doma Omladine in Belgrade. The proposal was refused.|$|E

2500|$|At the 2010 CMT Music Awards, held in June, Swift {{encountered}} an ex-boyfriend of hers. The {{two were}} seated {{a couple of}} seats away from each other, but were unwilling to speak to each other, although they both had much to say. As a result, they both pretended to be heavily engaged in conversations with those surrounding them, individuals who Swift noted to be practically strangers. Swift had the desire to confront him and ask him if the experience was as painful for him {{as it was for}} her. However, she did not do so because they both had [...] "silent shields up". [...] "We're sitting six seats away from each other and just fighting this silent war of ‘I don't care that you're here.' I don't care that you're here.' It's so terribly, heartbreakingly awkward", she said. She recalled it to be a miserable experience. When Swift arrived home, she spoke to her mother about the encounter, sitting at her kitchen table and said, [...] "I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room." [...] She then stood up and ran towards her bedroom to compose [...] "The Story of Us", something Swift's mother was already accustomed to. [...] "The Story of Us" [...] was the last track Swift composed for Speak Now, claiming that upon completing the song she knew <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> with the album. The song's subject was revealed by Swift to be the same for [...] "Dear John", which in an interview musician John Mayer confirmed that he was the song's subject. Furthermore, Swift and Mayer both attended the 2010 CMT Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers' {{response}} to the album was mostly positive, holding a score of 75 (out of 100) on music review aggregation website Metacritic. Andy Kellman from Allmusic said [...] "Stronger with Each Tear {{is a very good}} Blige album, if not quite a classic. One of her briefest sets, it is tremendously (almost studiously) balanced between all the ground she has covered so well before. That's no criticism, though, since most of the songs are easily memorable and display so much range. Those who detest [...] "The One" [...] on principle, for its use of Auto-Tune, need only to forward to the album's final song, a quiet and sparse throwback (to 40-plus years ago) production from Raphael Saadiq in which Blige professes new love to chilling effect." [...] Mikael Wood from Spin magazine also liked the album saying [...] "Mary J. Blige has spent the past decade effecting a slow transformation from R's queen of pain to the closest thing the genre counts to Oprah Winfrey. Judging by the titles on Blige's latest, that transformation is almost complete: 'Good Love,' 'I Feel Good,' 'I Love U (Yes I Du).' It's hard to believe this is the same woman who once felt the need to announce <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> with drama. Yet despite the conviction that those track names suggest—and despite solid writing and production contributions from A-listers [...] it feels less vital than 2005's terrific The Breakthrough or 2007's Growing Pains [...] The result is minor Mary—strong by many standards, a bit tepid by hers." [...] In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau offered the description, [...] "plainspoken, low-drama, midtempo love vows, with attempted glamour relegated to the cover shoot", while naming [...] "Tonight" [...] and [...] "I Am" [...] as the record's highlights.|$|E

She had a fine walk in her nightgown, and saw the flowers asleep, heard the little birds chirp in the nest, and watched the fireflies and moths at their pretty play.

A little beyond Honaunau, looking far ahead, he was aware of a woman bathing in the edge of the sea; and she seemed a well-grown girl, but he thought no more of it.
