5|$|Operation Grange {{was led by}} Commander Simon Foy. Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard's Homicide and <b>Serious</b> <b>Crime</b> Command was {{the first}} senior {{investigating}} officer, reporting to Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell. The team consisted of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables, and around six civilian staff. When Redwood retired in 2014, he was replaced by DCI Nicola Wall.

5|$|One of {{the private}} {{investigators}} was David Edgar, a retired detective inspector, hired {{on the recommendation of}} the head of Manchester's <b>Serious</b> <b>Crime</b> Squad. Edgar released an e-fit in August 2009 of a woman said to have asked two British men in Barcelona, Spain, shortly after the disappearance, whether they were there to deliver her new daughter. Other private initiatives included a Portuguese lawyer financing the search of a reservoir near Praia da Luz in February 2008, and the use of ground radar by a South African property developer, Stephen Birch, who said in 2012 that scans showed there were bones beneath the driveway of a house in Praia da Luz.|$|E
5|$|Detective Chief Superintendent Graham Melvin of the <b>Serious</b> <b>Crime</b> Squad {{was placed}} {{in charge of the}} {{investigation}} a few hours after the killing, at 2:00 am on 7 October. The inquiry became the largest {{in the history of the}} Metropolitan Police, with 150 officers assigned full-time. Melvin was born in Halifax in 1941, joining the Metropolitan Police in 1960, then the Criminal Investigation Department. He studied at Bramshill Police College, served with the Flying Squad, and was known for having solved several notorious cases, including that of Kenneth Erskine, the Stockwell Strangler. He became a detective chief superintendent in March, 1985, when he joined the elite International and Organised Crime Squad (SO1).|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of forensic {{science and the}} ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible {{at the time of the}} original examination. Combined with the removal of the double jeopardy law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of <b>serious</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
5|$|The National Police Directorate, {{located in}} Downtown Oslo, {{is the central}} {{administration}} for the Norwegian Police Service. It conducts management and supervision of the specialist agencies and police districts, including organizational development and support activities. The directorate {{is led by the}} National Police Commissioner, who, since 2012, has been Odd Reidar Humlegård. The National Criminal Investigation Service is a national unit which works with organized and <b>serious</b> <b>crime.</b> It both works as an assistant unit for police districts, with special focus on technical and tactical investigation, in addition to being responsible on its own for organized crime. It acts as the center for international police cooperation, including participation in Interpol and Europol. The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime is responsible for complex cases of economic crime and acts as a public prosecutor for those cases. The National Police Immigration Service registers and identifies asylum seekers and returns those which have their applications rejected. The National Mobile Police Service is based in Stavern and operates throughout the country. Their primary role is as highway patrol and manages the police reserves, although they also assist police districts in extraordinary events where extra manpower is needed or where they are in the vicinity.|$|E
