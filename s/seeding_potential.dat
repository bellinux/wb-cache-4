Instrumentation development included the state of construction of a NOAA type dual frequency radiometer for the continuous measurement of supercooled liquid water and the completion of an expendable balloon-borne system for measuring vertical profiles of supercooled liquid water. The analysis of data collected on the project was directed primarily at the interpretation of the vertical profiles of supercooled liquid water and vertical motion. Results indicate that sharp vertical gradients of supercooled liquid water often exist in winter orographic clouds. The relationships between measured supercooled liquid water and other variables strongly support previous findings that the precipitation augmentation potential of winter orographic clouds is substantial when the cloud top temperature is - 22 °C or warmer ad the cross-barrier wind speed (at mountaintop levels) is 8 m s - 1 or greater...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Noble fir (Abies procera Rehd.) is {{an upper}} {{elevation}} timber species {{native to the}} Cascade Range and (occasionally) the Coast Ranges of Washington and Oregon. It {{has always been a}} commerical species; however, recent changes in forest practices to increase harvests in the elevations where this tree occurs has caused a substantial increase in its importance. Because of this increase, the demand for seed has also risen greatly. However, the species produces few filled and viable seeds, despite an apparently large <b>seed</b> <b>potential.</b> This study reports a new estimate of noble fir's <b>seed</b> <b>potential,</b> and investigates some relatively unknown factors affecting seed production, the objective being to provide useful information to those interested in increasing levels of seed production. The study was carried out at two sites in Oregon in 1977. The primary site was in the Cascade Mountains east of J 1 olalla, elevation 1100 meters. The secondary site, where corroborative observations were made, was on Marys Peak in ie Coast Range about 20 km west of Corvallis, elevation 1190 meters. Both sites were chosen for accessibility and availability of climbable, cone-bearing trees. A sample of 20 mature cones gathered from eight trees at the Cascade site was used to estimate <b>seed</b> <b>potential</b> and the effect of various seed and cone insects. The relationship of <b>seed</b> <b>potential</b> and cone size characters was also studied, as was the relationship of these characters with insect damage levels. Biological observations of insects were made at approximately weekly intervals throughout the summer, and a weekly bagging experiment was utilized to gain oviposition information. Insect identifications were tentatively established on the basis of previous reports of insects on similar hosts. Final determinations were made by taxonomists at the United States National I 1 useum. Results of the study showed a <b>seed</b> <b>potential</b> of 133 <b>seeds</b> per cone, which is larger than previous estimates. Cone size differed significantly among trees, and <b>seed</b> <b>potential</b> was positively related to cone size. These results are similar to those for other conifers. The most significant biotic factors reducing seed production were insects. They destroyed 36 percent of sample seed. However, unknown factors, probably including a physiological one related to pollination, had a much greater effect, with 63 percent of sample seed empty or flat. Less than one percent of one seed was filled. Of the nine insects identified as affecting seeds and cones of noble fir, a fir seed chalcid (Megastigmus pinus Parfitt), and two fir cone maggots (Earomyia spp. ficAlpine), caused about 95 percent of total insect damage. The incts showed no preference for any cone portion, which is significant in regard to sampling for insects or damage. Also, except for fir seed chalcids, damage was unrelated to cone size and was not significantly different between trees. A short summary of each insect's activity was prepared, utilizing study results and other literature. Also, a key to the damage for each species was constructed...|$|R

The objective of this work was to evaluate the <b>seed</b> production <b>potential</b> of seventeen grass accesses of the species Paspalum notatum, P. lepton, P. lividum and Axonopus parodii. The experiment was conducted at Capão do Leão, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, in a randomized block design, with four replications. The evaluated variables were: number of inflorescences per area, number of florets per inflorescence and <b>seed</b> production <b>potential</b> (SPP). In order to measure the <b>seed</b> production <b>potential</b> of the accesses, the equation proposed is: SPP = number of florets per inflorescence x number of inflorescences per m 2.

40|$|Many tumors contain {{heterogeneous}} {{populations of}} cells, {{only some of}} which exhibit increased tumorigenicity and resistance to anticancer therapies. Evidence suggests that these aggressive cancer cells, often termed “cancer stem cells” or “cancer stem-like cells” (CSCs), rely upon developmental signaling pathways that are important for survival and expansion of normal stem cells. Here we report that, in analogy to embryonic mammary epithelial biology, estrogen signaling expands the pool of functional breast CSCs through a paracrine FGF/FGFR/Tbx 3 signaling pathway. Estrogen or FGF 9 pretreatment induced CSC properties of breast cancer cell lines and freshly isolated breast cancer cells, whereas cotreatment of cells with tamoxifen or a small molecule inhibitor of FGFR signaling was sufficient to prevent the estrogen-induced expansion of CSCs. Furthermore, reduction of FGFR or Tbx 3 gene expression was able to abrogate tumorsphere formation, whereas ectopic Tbx 3 expression increased tumor <b>seeding</b> <b>potential</b> by 100 -fold. These findings demonstrate that breast CSCs are stimulated by estrogen through a signaling pathway that similarly controls normal mammary epithelial stem cell biology...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Low-level {{thermodynamic}} stability, {{an important}} consideration for winter season ground-based cloud seeding site selection and conduct of operations, varies con-siderably in and near mountainous terrain. Rawinsonde observations may sometimes be poorly representative of nearby areas, with significant lower-level atmospheric tempera-ture variability common between basins and sometimes within a basin. Operational fore-cast models may lack the ability to resolve or properly initialize low-level stability or “cold pooling ” specific to a given basin or portion of a basin. Analyses of surface observations, as well as plume dispersion modeling with HYSPLIT, can be used both for real-time op-erations and in post-hoc examinations of low-level stability specific to storm periods with cloud <b>seeding</b> <b>potential.</b> Analyses of this type have been performed in various portions of Utah, and a recent analysis in the Uinta Range and Uinta Basin area of northeastern Utah highlights both the geographic variability and the seasonality of basin cold pooling. The Uinta Basin analyses have shown much greater low-level thermodynamic stability during relevant winter storm periods than other portions of Utah. Strong correlation of stability to site elevation within the basin, as well as distinct seasonality, are observed. 1...|$|E

The well-documented correlation between the severity of tau pathology and disease progression implies a prion-like seeding and spreading mechanism for tau. Experimentally, this has been addressed in transgenic mice by the injection of protein lysates isolated from brains of transgenic mice or patients with tauopathies, including AD, that were shown to behave like seeds, accelerating tau pathology and tangle formation in predisposed mice. More specifically, in vivo data suggest that brain lysates from mice harboring the P 301 S mutation of tau can seed protein aggregation when injected into the hippocampi of human wild-type tau transgenic ALZ 17 mice. Here, we compared the <b>seeding</b> <b>potential</b> of lysates and extracellular vesicles enriched for exosomes (EVs) from wild-type and human P 301 L tau transgenic rTg 4510 mouse brains.

Data were collected from P. pinea forest in Strofylia, southern Greece, a forest that belongs to the Natura 2000 European network and the RAMSAR convention and is characterized by the absence of regeneration for many decades. The pine stands found in the area were distinguished into Wve categories according to a previous study and our observations, regarding stand age, canopy cover and the degree of stress by human pressure.

Program goals were {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the Utah operational cloud seeding program and to recommend improvements. Field programs employed a wide variety of instrumentation systems. Sophisticated numerical modeling was used in conjunction with the observational programs. Amounts and distributions of SLW (supercooled liquid water) cloud were investigated, as was transport and dispersion of ground-released seeding agents and tracer gases. Several experiments directly monitored ice crystals and snowfall rates resulting from either silver iodide (Agl) or liquid propane seeding. Results showed frequent SLW in excess of natural conversion to snowfall, suggesting significant <b>seeding</b> <b>potential.</b> The SLW was concentrated near the terrain where temperatures were relatively warm. When valley-released Agl was transported to cloud levels, resulting ice crystal formation was usually too limited for significant snowfall augmentation.

40|$|International audienceThe abiotic {{degradation}} {{state of sea}} ice algae released during a late spring ice melt process was determined by sampling the underlying waters and measuring certain well-known algal lipids and their oxidation products, including those derived from epi-brassicasterol, 24 -methylenecholesterol, palmitoleic acid and the phytyl side-chain of chlorophyll. More specifically, parent lipids {{and some of their}} oxidation products were quantified in suspended (collected by filtration) and sinking (collected with sediment traps at 5 and 30 m) particles from Resolute Passage (Canada) during a period of spring ice melt in 2012 and the outcomes compared with those obtained from related sea ice samples analyzed previously. Our data show that suspended cells in the near surface waters appeared to be only very weakly affected by photooxidative processes, likely indicative of a community of unaggregated living cells with high <b>seeding</b> <b>potential</b> for further growth. In contrast, we attribute the strong photooxidation state of the organic matter in the sediment traps deployed at 5 m to the presence of senescent and somewhat aggregated sea ice algae that descended only relatively slowly within the euphotic zone, and was thus susceptible to photochemical degradation. On the other hand, the increased abiotic preservation of the sinking material collected in the sediment traps deployed at 30 m, likely reflected more highly aggregated senescent sea ice algae that settled sufficiently rapidly out of the euphotic zone to avoid significant photooxidation. This better-preserved sinking material in the deeper sediment traps may therefore contribute more strongly to the underlying sediments.

40|$|Historic annual {{increases}} in global carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration {{are expected to}} continue; increased global temperatures are forecast as well. Crop productivity can benefit from increased ambient CO 2 as similar assimilation rates can be maintained with smaller canopy conductance, resulting in modestly reduced crop water requirement.

When elevated temperatures exceed optimal conditions for assimilation, stress responses can include damage to the light-harvesting complex of leaves, impaired carbon-fixing enzymes, thereby reducing components of yield including <b>seed</b> <b>potential,</b> <b>seed</b> set, grain fill rate, and grain fill duration.

40|$|Aging is {{the most}} {{important}} risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases associated with pathological protein aggregation such as Alzheimer’s disease. Although aging is an important player, it remains unknown which molecular changes are relevant for disease initiation. Recently, it has become apparent that widespread protein aggregation is a common feature of aging. Indeed, several studies demonstrate that 100 s of proteins become highly insoluble with age, in the absence of obvious disease processes. Yet it remains unclear how these misfolded proteins aggregating with age affect neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, several of these aggregation-prone proteins are found as minor components in disease-associated hallmark aggregates such as amyloid-β plaques or neurofibrillary tangles. This co-localization raises the possibility that age-dependent protein aggregation directly contributes to pathological aggregation. Here, we show {{for the first time that}} highly insoluble proteins from aged Caenorhabditis elegans or aged mouse brains, but not from young individuals, can initiate amyloid-β aggregation in vitro. We tested the <b>seeding</b> <b>potential</b> at four different ages across the adult lifespan of C. elegans. Significantly, protein aggregates formed during the early stages of aging did not act as seeds for amyloid-β aggregation. Instead, we found that changes in protein aggregation occurring during middle-age initiated amyloid-β aggregation. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed several late-aggregating proteins that were previously identified as minor components of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles such as 14 - 3 - 3, Ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 1 and Lamin A/C, highlighting these as strong candidates for cross-seeding. Overall, we demonstrate that widespread protein misfolding and aggregation with age could be critical for the initiation of pathogenesis, and thus should be targeted by therapeutic strategies to alleviate neurodegenerative diseases...|$|E

40|$|Several {{challenges}} persist when {{attempting to}} utilise decellularized tissue as a scaffold for vascular tissue engineering. Namely: poor cell infiltration/migration, excessive culture times associated with repopulating the scaffolds, and the achievement of a quiescent medial layer. In an attempt to create an optimum vascular scaffold we customised the properties of decellularized porcine carotid arteries by: (i) creating cavities within the medial layer to allow direct injection of cells, and (ii) controlling the amount of collagen digestion to increase the porosity. Histological examination of our customised scaffold revealed a highly porous tissue structure containing consistent medial cavities running longitudinally through the porous scaffold wall. Mechanical testing of the customised scaffold showed that our minimal localised disruption to the ECM {{does not have a}} detrimental effect on the bulk mechanical response of the tissue. The results demonstrate that an increased stiffness and reduced distensibility occurs after decellularisation when compared to native tissue, however post scaffold customisation we can revert the scaffold tensile properties back to that of native tissue. This most noteworthy result occurs in the elastin dominant phase of the tensile response of the scaffold, indicating no disruption has occurred to the elastin network by our decellularization and customisation techniques. Additionally, the bulk <b>seeding</b> <b>potential</b> of the customised scaffold was demonstrated by direct injection of human smooth muscle cells through the medial cavities. The optimum cell dispersion was observed in the highest porosity scaffold, with large cell numbers retained within the medial layer after 24 h static culture.

On farms, average seedbank additions during harvest were approximately 20 times the normal seeding rate of canola. High secondary <b>seed</b> dormancy <b>potential</b> prolonged seedbank persistence in fields, irrespective of tillage system. B. napus exhibited seedling recruitment of a typical summer annual weed where seedling recruitment was only observed in the spring. Seasonal seedling recruitment was the result of two fates: seed death in the shallow seedbank, irrespective of dormancy potential, and increased ungerminability in buried seeds which was related to secondary <b>seed</b> dormancy <b>potential.</b> Among the factors that contribute to secondary <b>seed</b> dormancy <b>potential,</b> genotype was of greatest significance.

40|$|Software design {{continues}} to evolve from the structured programming {{paradigm of the}} 1970 s and 1980 s and the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm of the 1980 s and 1990 s. The functional decomposition design methodology used in these paradigms reduced the prominence of non-functional requirements, which resulted in scattered and tangled code to address non-functional elements. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) allowed the removal of crosscutting concerns scattered throughout class code into single modules known as aspects. Aspectization resulted in increased modularity in class code, but introduced new types of problems {{that did not exist}} in OOP. One such problem was aspect interference, in which aspects meddled with the data flow or control flow of a program. Research has developed various solutions for detecting and addressing aspect interference using formal design and specification methods, and by programming techniques that specify aspect precedence. Such explicit specifications required practitioners to have a complete understanding of possible aspect interference in an AOP system under development. However, as system size increased, understanding of possible aspect interference could decrease. Therefore, practitioners needed a way to increase their understanding of possible aspect interference within a program. This study used clustering analysis to locate potential aspect interference within an aspect-oriented program under development, using k-means partitional clustering. Vector space models, using two newly defined metrics, interference potential (IP) and interference causality potential (ICP), and an existing metric, coupling on advice execution (CAE), provided input to the clustering algorithms. Resulting clusters were analyzed via an internal strategy using the R-Squared, Dunn, Davies-Bouldin, and SD indexes. The process was evaluated on both a smaller scale AOP system (AspectTetris), and a larger scale AOP system (AJHotDraw). By <b>seeding</b> <b>potential</b> interference problems into these programs and comparing results using visualizations, this study found that clustering analysis provided a viable way for detecting interference problems in aspect-oriented software.

More detailed studies involving two different genotypes of 'Grasslands Huia' white clover grown in monoculture were also carried out {{to examine the effects}} of cutting and paraquat application. The mixed sward studies clearly showed that November closing dates resulted in highest seed yields. In grass/clover swards the closing of crops in November accompanied by paraquat spraying to remove grass competition either in mid October or at closing, enhanced seed yield. Later grazing and spraying was deleterious to seed yield unless climatic conditions allowed continued vegetative growth into December. In this latter case spraying in November and closing in December gave high seed yields. Treatments involving closing in September and October and spraying 30 days before, at closing or 30 days after closing, always gave less seed yield than November treatments sprayed 30 days before or at closing time. Closing time and spraying time had a marked effect on seed yield components. The most consistent and major effect of closing and spraying treatments in the two mixed sward experiments was on inflorescence numbers. Other components such as seed set, seed weight, and floret numbers were not consistently influenced by management but did vary according to environmental conditions. Studies on the effects of cuttings and paraquat application on plant structure and on <b>seeding</b> <b>potential</b> and yield of 'Grasslands Huia' white clover clearly showed that there is a partitioning between vegetative growth and reproductive development. The vegetative process was characterised by a high percentage of the nodes on main stolons forming lateral stolons in the winter and early spring. Reproductive development in late spring and summer showed that approximately 80 % of inflorescences were formed on main stolons. Highest inflorescence numbers were produced from nodes formed in October and November, although floral initiation started during late winter (August). The two genotypes used in this study showed considerable variation in relation to reproductive development. Differences of 47 % in inflorescence numbers, 25 % in seeds per floret and 13 % in seed weight were observed between genotypes. The effects of defoliation by cutting involved a reduction in stolon elongation and a general increase in lateral stolon production, particularly when terminal buds were also removed. Both light and heavy cutting treatments resulted in seed yields which were 70 to 90 kg/ha less than the 657 kg/ha produced by uncut plants. The effect of paraquat application was also detrimental to seed yield, mainly through a direct effect on white clover morphology. Although paraquat reduced the amount of lateral branching on the main stolon the destruction of stolon tissue by the herbicide reduced plant recovery and resulted in a seed yield of only 392 kg/ha compared with 657 kg/ha from unsprayed plants. This effect was most pronounced in pure swards of white clover and was less obvious when the grass component of a mixed sward provided some protection for the white clover by reducing the extent of direct contact with the herbicide. Some potential areas for future research and the potential for white clover seed production in Colombia are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Operation Framework In {{the arid}} climate of Southern and Central Utah, {{there is a}} {{continuing}} need to augment water supplies. While much of the water is needed for summertime use, particularly for irrigation, most of the available water is supplied by winter storms. Therefore, {{it is for the}} augmentation of the water stored naturally as snowpack at higher elevations that cloud seeding can make its greatest contribution. Over the past several years, an attempt has been made to augment the snowpack by cloud seeding. Although there is a physical basis for expecting an increase in precipitation from a scientifically managed cloud seeding program, the empirical evidence that such increases have actually resulted is inconclusive. If the desired increases have not been achieved, the most likely explanation is that the empirical data necessary to distinguish seeding opportunities adequately have not been collected and applied. Presently, it is worthwhile to design a cloud seeding program in which plans are made beforehand to obtain appropriate field data for use in the execution and evaluation of the program. Inasmuch as both the clouds available for seeding and the precipitation and storage of water in the form of snowpack are concentrated in the mountains, the area of precipitation augmentation is best confined also to the mountains. Even though the duration of the seeding program may be indefinite, the duration of operation to be evaluated should be defined in advance and carried out as planned. To do otherwise could introduce unwanted bias and doubtful conclusions. Although an improved operational project with an extensive evaluation included in the design costs much more than that of a simple cloud seeding effort, the benefits will undoubtedly justify the expenditure. The reason is twofold. In terms of immediate benefits, the program will improve determination of which clouds or storms are seedable and concentrate the seeding effort where it will be most beneficial. In the long run, a properly planned and executed evaluation will produce results that will enhance the long term stability of the seeding program as a while. Concerning the socio-economic impact of more effective cloud seeding, the benefits of an increased snowpack are likely to far exceed both the cost of benefits of an increased snowpack are likely to far exceed both the cost of the program and any occasional undesirable side effects. However, the disbenefits of the program should not be overlooked. Potential problems include increased flooding during spring runoff, increased avalanche hazard, and increased inconvenience to mountain communities. On the other hand, only artificial increases of precipitation in these occurrences can reasonably be attributed to cloud seeding. Therefore, it is worthwhile to include in the plan sufficient measurements {{that can be used to}} deal with such problems on a rational basis. Finally, a public education effort should be included so that information on all aspects of the cloud seeding program and its reason for being are available to the public. Research Framework The research associated with this program should be primarily directed toward achieving a definitive evaluation of seeding effects. To accomplish this goal, the evaluation must be specifically designed to do so. Therefore, there are two requirements placed upon the total program, one is to increase precipitation, the other is to clearly demonstrate that precipitation has indeed been increased. A secondary objective of the research is to develop a knowledge of the actual potential for increased precipitation in the target area. Measurements of relevant parameters over space and time are needed to determine the spatial and temporal variability as well as the frequency of seedable storms. At the same time, the vertical temperature stability at low levels is needed to determine the fraction of time ground seeding generators are effective. In order to increase precipitation efficiently, these measurements are needed anyway. The only extra work needed to improve our knowledge of <b>seeding</b> <b>potential</b> is an analysis of such data as it becomes available. Research to develop improved methods of indentifying seedability, determine what type of seeding material to use, or decide whether it is better to seed by air or ground requires systematic data collection, but the effort needs to be much more concentrated than appropriate for the general clouding seeding operation and evaluation described here. Such research data collection and evaluation are best left to controlled experiments such as are being conducted at Utah State University. The present project should, in contrast, emphasize measurements needed in the application of previous research results and evaluation of what is actually achieved by cloud seeding in an operational mode. The technology employed should not include promising methods or approaches still being studied but not yet tested in confirmatory experiments...|$|E

40|$|Jatropha curcas L. is a {{tropical}} tree {{belonging to the}} Euphorbiaceae family. The high oil content and suitable fatty acid composition of the seeds are two arguments to promote J. curcas as a promising biodiesel crop. However, little information {{is available on the}} regeneration ecology and productivity of the species. In addition to this, the higher number of male flowers compared to female flowers results in a low yield. A better knowledge of the reproductive ecology of the species is imperative (e. g. pollination process, flowering, fruiting, seed yield, seed dispersal and establishment) for yield optimization and invasiveness risk assessment and management. Therefore this research first focused on the current discourse and it questions how to increase the seed and oil yield of J. curcas through agronomic approaches such as pollen manipulation, pruning, spacing and fertilization. The second question was the invasiveness issue of J. curcas. To answer both questions we formulated the following research objectives: (i) identify the possible potential arthropod pollinators of J. curcas, (ii) find out the best pollination method to increase seed yield, oil quantity and quality, (iii) identify the best agronomic management practices and timing to modify flower sex ratio and to increase seed and oil yield of J. curcas, and (iv) assess the invasiveness risk of J. curcas and <b>seeding</b> <b>potential</b> to adjacent land ecosystems. For seed yielding crops such as J. curcas it can be expected that successful pollination is a key process that affects seed yield, oil quantity and oil quality. Insight into the diversity and movement of potential pollinators forms an important aspect of the needed knowledge. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation we report on J. curcas flower visitors observed in two Southern African countries. Observations at two sites, each on 10 trees, during 10 days showed that 41 insects and 2 Arachnida in Zambia and 29 insect species in Malawi visited J. curcas flowers. Diptera and Hymenoptera were the largest group. The most abundant insect visitors were Apis mellifera and Chrysomya chloropyga. A. mellifera visits more inflorescences within shorter period than C. chloropyga and shows a frequent appearance in both sites. Floral phenology studies and pollination experiments (natural and artificial) in two sites in Zambia (2 year and 5 year old plantations) and one site in Malawi (5 year plantation) showed J. curcas is not only of protandrous nature, as previously reported. It can be both protandrous and protogynous and able to produce seeds through both self-and cross-pollination. The male to female flower sex ratios were 22 : 1, 17 : 1 and 10 : 1 respectively for 2 year and 5 year old plantation in Zambia and 5 years old plantation in Malawi. The flower longevity periods (mean± SE) were 1. 80 ± 0. 07 days for male flowers and 4. 5 ± 0. 18 days for female flowers. Fewer fruit set and lower seed yield were recorded from autogamous pollination in Zambia sites. In the case of Malawi, more matured fruits resulted from autogamous pollination but the fruits contained fewer seeds. High fruit and seed yield were recorded for open pollination similar to pollen-supplemented pollination at Zambia sites, which indicates there was no pollen limitation in the study sites. In the Malawi site, there was no seed yield difference between pollination treatments. The natural fruit set and seed yield in Zambia indicates that conserving the natural pollination will improve J. curcas fruit set and seed yield, as a base for better oil production. The seed morphology, seed oil content (g), seed oil concentration (%) and oil fatty acid composition study after different pollination treatments in Zambia showed the effect of pollination more reflected in total oil yield per inflorescence and tree than in unit seed oil content and concentration. Up to 70 % and 29 % oil yield reduction was observed for autonomous autogamy and self-pollination treatments, respectively, compared to open pollination. Cross- and self-pollination resulted in longer seeds than open pollination but not in oil content and concentration differences. The oil has high unsaturated fatty acid content (80 %) and is composed of 9 fatty acids. Pollination treatments had an effect on fatty acid composition of individual seed oil from mature trees (5 year old), but did not for 2 year old trees. The oleic acid content, a determinant fatty acid component for quality biodiesel production, was lower for artificial self-pollination (9 % reduction) compared to open pollination. This research demonstrates overall oil yield and quality are the highest under natural pollination. This shows the importance of safeguarding the quality and effectiveness of open natural pollination. This can be done by enhancing the presence of insects identified as J. curcas pollinators, particularly those pollinators enhancing cross-pollination. Proper application of fertilizer and canopy management such as pruning and planting density are believed to increase J. curcas seed and oil yield. The 2009 to 2011 field experiments in Balaka, Malawi showed J. curcas yield can be best improved without pruning. Spacing and pruning did not show flower sex ratio differences among the treatments. We found up to 55 % seed and final oil yield reduction after pruning, particularly for trees pruned in the dry cold season, and beginning of rainy season compared to non-pruned trees. It is claimed that J. curcas can be grown on soils with low nutrient content but this study revealed that yield was low for non-fertilized trees, even on good soils. Fertilizer application altered the flower sex ratio of J. curcas. Seed yield and oil yield increased at higher application rates of Phosphorus (at 200 % P level, relative to the recommended rate) and Nitrogen (at 143 % N level, relative to the recommended rate) with an increase of seed yield and oil yield (mean ± SE) to 217 ± 41 % and 217 ± 38 % and 203 ± 42 % and 204 ± 45 % respectively compared to non-fertilized trees. Based onthe integrated invasiveness research experiments (spontaneous occurrence of seedlings, seed dispersal mechanisms, seed predation by animals, and germination success of dispersed seeds) in Zambia, J. curcas is not an invasive species. No spontaneous regeneration was observed in land use systems adjacent to J. curcas plantations. Primary seed dispersal was limited, and predominantly under the canopy of the mother plant. Rodents and shrews dispersed and predated J. curcas seeds and fruits. They transported the seeds up to 23 m from the sources and repositioned them in their burrows up to 0. 7 m deep, but none of these seeds could establish. Germination experiments in adjacent land use systems revealed 4 % germination success at the soil surface, and 65 % if buried artificially at 1 - 2 cm depth, yet the latter is unlikely to occur under natural conditions. These findings show that J. curcas seeds may be dispersed by animals to adjacent land use systems, but no natural recruitment was observed given low germination on the surface and none in burrows. All together these results suggest that the plant currently does not show an elevated risk of invasion to adjacent land use systems, at least not in the investigated case study. The overall study elucidates the importance of understanding the critical steps and processes of J. curcas regeneration ecology to optimize seed yield, oil yield and to avoid the invasiveness risk of the species in Africa. The research methodology can be also applied for other similar current tropical biofuel crops. As such, this study adds to the scientific knowledge of the regeneration ecology of tropical biofuel crops in tropical and sub tropical regions of the world. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} of developers testing code is deter-mining a test suite’s quality – its ability to find faults.

Deter-mining which criteria best predict mutation kills is critical to practical estimation of test suite quality.
