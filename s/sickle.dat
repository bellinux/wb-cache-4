5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{distinctive}} feature of Deinonychus, the shape and curvature of the <b>sickle</b> claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved <b>sickle</b> claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in {{the size and shape}} of the <b>sickle</b> claws could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to get more insight into the social significance of Late Bronze Age -Early Iron crescent shaped <b>sickles</b> from the Netherlands. This is done by reexamination of several physical characteristics of the <b>sickles,</b> their distribution and their archaeological context. It has turned out that albeit the <b>sickles</b> have many different appearances and they are hard to categorize, they are made out of the same exotic flint type and by proficient flint knappers. In addition, they are all used to cut sods. The <b>sickles</b> mostly occur in landscapes which in the Late Bronze Age -Early Iron age were threatened by water. They seem closely related with the construction of artificial dwelling mounds. Since the <b>sickles</b> are made from non-local flint by excellent craftspeople, people presumably perceived the <b>sickles</b> as special objects. Moreover, the <b>sickles</b> were used to cut sods and sods were used for various purposes that helped people survive in the same region for a longer period. So the <b>sickles</b> made it possible for people to 'confirm their roots'. The absence of complete <b>sickles</b> in settlements and the selective deposition of several collections of <b>sickles,</b> which often have different use lives, support the idea that people were well aware of the <b>sickles</b> special cultural biographies. So albeit the <b>sickles</b> have been perceived as mainly functional objects, this thesis proves that they have several social connotations which can be derived from their cultural biography...|$|R

5|$|Song Ci {{also shared}} his opinion that having the accused suspect {{of the murder}} present at the autopsy of his victim, in close {{proximity}} to the grieving relatives of the deceased, was a very powerful psychological tool for the authorities to gain confessions. In the earliest known case of forensic entomology, a villager was hacked to death with a <b>sickle,</b> which led the local magistrate to assemble all the villagers in a town square to lay down their sickles in order for blow flies to gather around which <b>sickle</b> still had unseen remnants of the victim's blood; when it became apparent which <b>sickle</b> was used as the murder weapon, the confessing murderer was arrested on the spot.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} <b>sickle</b> cell trait on malaria {{immunity}} illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs {{that have occurred}} because of endemic malaria. <b>Sickle</b> cell trait causes {{a change in the}} hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified hemoglobinS molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to <b>sickle</b> or distort into a curved shape. In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to <b>sickle,</b> and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.|$|E

5|$|Ostrom {{suggested}} that Deinonychus could kick with the <b>sickle</b> claw {{to cut and}} slash at its prey. Some researchers even {{suggested that}} the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs.

In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E

5|$|The {{flag of the}} Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic {{was adopted}} by decree on December 25, 1951. The flag was {{slightly}} modified in 1956 when construction details were added for the red star, and golden hammer and <b>sickle.</b> The final specifications of the flag was set in Article 120 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR and {{are very similar to}} the current Belarusian flag. The flag had a length-to-width ratio of one to two (1:2), just like the flag of the Soviet Union (and the other fourteen union republics). The main portion of the flag was red (representing the Revolution), with the rest being green (representing the Belarusian forests). A pattern of white drawn on red decorated the hoist portion of the flag; this design is often used on Belarusian traditional costumes. In the upper corner of the flag, in the red portion, a gold hammer and <b>sickle</b> was added, with a red star outlined in gold above it. The hammer represented the worker, and the <b>sickle</b> the peasant; according to Soviet ideology, these two symbols crossed together symbolized co-operation between the two classes. The red star, a symbol commonly used by Communist parties, was said to stand either for the five social groups (workers, youth, peasants, military, and academics), the five known continents, or the five fingers of the worker's hand. The hammer, <b>sickle</b> and star were sometimes not displayed on the reverse of the flag. The purpose for this design was that the Byelorussian SSR, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR, were admitted to the United Nations in 1945 as founding members and needed distinct flags for each other. The designer of the flag was Milkahil Gusyev.|$|E

He confronted his wife, who confessed to the affair. <b>Sickles</b> then made his wife write out her confession on paper. <b>Sickles</b> saw Key sitting on a bench outside the <b>Sickles</b> home on February 27, 1859, signalling to Teresa, and confronted him. [...] <b>Sickles</b> rushed outside into Lafayette Square, cried [...] "Key, you scoundrel, you have dishonored my home; you must die", and with a pistol repeatedly shot the unarmed Key. Key was taken into the nearby Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House, where he died some time later.|$|R

5|$|Forensic entomology: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{forensic}} science book Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified published by court judge, physician, medical scientist and writer Song Ci in 1247 contains the oldest known case of forensic entomology.

The local magistrate had the villagers assemble {{in the town square}} where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles. Within minutes, a mass of blow flies gathered around one <b>sickle</b> and none other, attracted to the scent of traces of blood unseen by the naked eye.

5|$|The low foot {{to lower}} leg ratio in Deinonychus is due partly to an unusually short {{metatarsus}} (upper foot bones). The ratio is actually larger in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Ostrom {{suggested that the}} short metatarsus {{may be related to}} the function of the <b>sickle</b> claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features– the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc.– as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the <b>sickle</b> claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the Deinonychus leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles was used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of Deinonychus represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.|$|E
5|$|This emblem was in turn {{replaced}} by a new one in 1950. The central feature of this symbol is a crossed hammer and <b>sickle,</b> a universal Communist symbol symbolizing the unity of workers and peasants. Below this symbol, a sun is shown rising behind a globe. The insignia is framed by ears of wheat, each ear ending in flowers; clover {{on the left and}} flax on the right. A red ribbon is wrapped around the ears of wheat, reminiscent of the red flag used by the Communist movement. The base of the emblem shows the letters БССР. The ribbon features the phrase Workers of the World, Unite! The left side inscribed in Belarusian, the right side in Russian. The red star of Communism is featured above the hammer and <b>sickle.</b> The 1950 version was designed by Ivan Dubasov, a People's Artist of the USSR. Article 119 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR defines the design of the emblem.|$|E
