25|$|From the Middle Ages onwards, {{categorical}} <b>syllogism</b> and <b>syllogism</b> {{were usually}} used interchangeably. This article is concerned only with this traditional use.

Later during the Islamic Golden Age, there was a logical debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical <b>syllogism.</b> Some Islamic scholars argued that Qiyas refers to inductive reasoning, which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that Qiyas does not refer to inductive reasoning, but refers to categorical <b>syllogism</b> in a real sense and analogical reasoning in a metaphorical sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058–1111) (and in modern times, Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi) argued that Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical <b>syllogism</b> in a metaphorical sense.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the Method of Minimal Representation (MMR, i. e., an {{alternative}} diagrammatic technique {{to test the}} validity of <b>syllogisms)</b> is employed to differentiate perfect (first figure) from imperfect <b>syllogisms</b> (other figures). It demonstrates that the validity of perfect <b>syllogisms</b> can be exhibited applying lesser number of rules, which govern the proposed method. This is also in accordance with Aristotle’s dictum of ceteris paribus, which assumes the superiority of a demonstration that is derived through fewer postulates or hypotheses. This paper is divided into four sections. The first section gives a brief exposition on the historical preliminaries of perfect <b>syllogisms.</b> The second section elaborates the method of minimal representation. In the penultimate section, we test first figure <b>syllogisms</b> and contrast them with other figures by the proposed method.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigated whether {{dealing with}} a homogeneous subset of <b>syllogisms</b> with time-constrained responses encouraged participants to develop and use heuristics for abstract (Experiment 1) and thematic (Experiment 2) <b>syllogisms.</b> An atmosphere-based heuristic accounted for most responses with both abstract and thematic <b>syllogisms.</b> With thematic <b>syllogisms,</b> a weaker effect of a belief heuristic was also observed, mainly where the correct response was inconsistent with {{the atmosphere of the}} premises. Analytic processes appear to have played little role in the time-constrained condition, whereas their involvement increased in a self-paced, unconstrained condition. From a dual-process perspective, the results further specify how task demands affect the recruitment of heuristic and analytic systems of reasoning.

Previous studies with adult participants (Politzer, 2011) {{have shown that}} the rate of success is remarkably high. Because their resolution requires only the use of a simple strategy (known as ecthesis in classic logic) and an operational use of the concept of inclusion (the recognition that an element that belongs to a subset must belong to the set but not vice versa), it was hypothesised that these <b>syllogisms</b> would be within the grasp of non- adult participants, provided they have acquired the notion of deductive validity. Here, 11 - year-old children were presented with natural <b>syllogisms</b> embedded in short dialogues. The first experiment showed that their performance was equivalent to adults' highest level of performance in standard experiments on <b>syllogisms.</b> The second experiment, while confirming children's proficiency in solving natural <b>syllogisms,</b> showed that they outperformed children who solved non-natural matched <b>syllogisms</b> in the same experimental setting.

Unfortunately, the practical use of traditional <b>syllogisms</b> is quite restricted.

On the other hand, the “At least one … ” propositions are too weak, since a single example suffices for verification. The present contribution studies algebraic interpretations of <b>syllogisms</b> with comparative quantifiers (e. g., “Most … are…”) {{and quantitative}} quantifiers (e. g., “n/m … are…”, “all, except n … are…”).
