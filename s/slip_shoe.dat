60|$|At length {{the man of}} {{the house}} came to the door. He had on his breeches, or drawers, and a yellow flannel waistcoat, no stockings, a pair of <b>slip</b> <b>shoes,</b> a white cap on his head, and, as the young man said, death in his face.|$|R
60|$|Dan <b>slipped</b> off his <b>shoes.</b> 'When we {{get home}} I shall sit in the woods all day,' he said.|$|R
60|$|She <b>slipped</b> on her <b>shoes</b> and a shawl, {{and came}} back where he was working, and took a seat on a sawhorse.|$|R

40|$|Photograph {{used for}} {{a story in the}} Oklahoma Times newspaper. Caption: "Borowing an idea from the racing game, in which a {{thoroughbred}} always is reshod with new and light shoes for a race, coach Bill Haller (kneeling above) of the Capitol Hill basketball team, <b>slips</b> new <b>shoes</b> on his ace scorer, Chester Bryan. ...|$|R
60|$|Climbing a ridge on a snow {{crust is}} no child's play, as Walter soon found out. It {{sometimes}} {{seemed as if}} he slipped back two feet for every one he gained. He tried taking off the shoes, {{only to find that}} in sheltered places he broke through and was worse off than on the <b>slipping</b> <b>shoes.</b> But he was grimly resolved that he would get {{to the top of the}} ridge, cost him what it might. It was characteristic of the boy that what he set out to do he did. So he ground his teeth and kept at it, slipping, scrambling, pulling himself up by brush and trees. After a little he discovered that by zigzagging back and forth along the face of the slope and taking advantage of every little inequality he could make fairly good progress.|$|R
60|$|Lida, {{recovering}} her wits, snatched at the offered gift, with a sparkle in her dull eyes. Sure {{she would}} put them on, and that mighty quick, before any one appeared with authority to recall them. In a minute she had pulled the stockings over her scrawny little legs and <b>slipped</b> Faith's <b>shoes</b> over her thick little ankles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see it's {{such a good}} {{lesson to}} me! I had <b>slipped</b> off my <b>shoes</b> when I was lying down, and I couldn't get away, he came in so suddenly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on {{and listen}} to what happens," [...] said Andy, and presently, having <b>slipped</b> off their <b>shoes,</b> he and the others {{followed}} Walt down the corridor, but kept well in the background.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, I can undress in the dark. I'm used to it." [...] She {{loosened}} {{the collar}} of her dress, <b>slipped</b> off her <b>shoes,</b> {{and lay down on}} the bed bitter and rebellious.|$|R
25|$|During Life on Mars, Hunt often wore a beige camel {{coat with}} {{a white shirt and}} tie, grey suit and {{trousers}} with white <b>slip</b> on <b>shoes,</b> typical of the period. His top shirt button is always undone and his tie always hangs halfway down his chest in an untidy, disheveled fashion. In Ashes to Ashes, he is often seen wearing a black suit, striped tie, Crombie coat and snakeskin boots.|$|R
60|$|Waiting {{about twenty}} minutes after the last man of the {{previous}} watch had gone below, I motioned to Jarl, and we <b>slipped</b> our <b>shoes</b> from our feet. He then descended into the forecastle, and I sauntered aft toward the quarter-deck. All was still. Thrice did I pass my hand full before {{the face of the}} slumbering lubber at the helm, and right between him and the light of the binnacle.|$|R
60|$|He <b>slipped</b> on his <b>shoes</b> {{and went}} outside. Just landing {{from one of}} the Valhalla's boats was the third mate of that vessel, who was an {{acquaintance}} of Simon's, and three sailors from the fruiter.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Mr. Wadsworth had appeared, in a bath-robe, and Dunston Porter also showed himself. Dave <b>slipped</b> on his <b>shoe</b> again and fairly {{threw himself into}} his coat, and Roger also rearranged his toilet.|$|R
25|$|Galoshes, {{also known}} as dickersons, gumshoes, or overshoes, are a type of rubber boot that is <b>slipped</b> over <b>shoes</b> {{to keep them from}} getting muddy or wet. In the United States, the word galoshes may be used interchangeably with boot, {{especially}} a rubberized boot. In the United Kingdom, however, a galosh is an overshoe made of a weatherproof material to protect a more vulnerable shoe underneath and keep the foot warm and dry.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oho, {{art thou}} there, lickspittle of the English? Go in to-morrow across the Border to pay service to Orde Sahib's successor, and thou shalt <b>slip</b> thy <b>shoes</b> at the tent-door of a Bengali, as thou shalt hand thy {{offering}} to a Bengali's black fist. This I know; {{and in my}} youth, when a young man spoke evil to a Mullah holding the doors of Heaven and Hell, the gun-butt was not rammed down the Mullah's gullet. No!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind those hotels now!" [...] cried Dave, as he <b>slipped</b> off one <b>shoe</b> after another. [...] "It's get to bed now and {{an early}} start {{in the morning to}} see if we can't catch Blower, Haskers, and--Morr!" [...] and he grinned.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not without}} great fear and {{trepidation}} that little Nell <b>slipped</b> off her <b>shoes</b> and gliding through the store-room of old curiosities, where Mr Brass--the ugliest piece of goods in all the stock--lay sleeping on a mattress, passed into her own little chamber.|$|R
60|$|The more Dave thought {{over the}} affair the more was he puzzled. As {{quickly as he}} could, he put on some of his {{clothing}} and <b>slipped</b> on his <b>shoes.</b> Then he opened the stateroom door and {{stepped out into the}} passageway leading to the main saloon.|$|R
5000|$|The {{slipperiness}} and smoothness {{of sheer}} pantyhose and stockings also makes women's low cut court <b>shoes</b> <b>slip</b> off more easily. This vulnerability is often sexually attractive, and can often {{result in the}} women engaging in shoe dangling or shoe play which is also greatly appealing to shoe and foot fetishists.|$|R
60|$|Whereupon {{these two}} {{delightful}} imps chuckled and wagged their heads with a sincere enjoyment that this mere world could not give! Johnny <b>slipped</b> off his <b>shoes</b> and stockings and hurriedly {{put them on}} the infant Florry, securing them from falling off with a thick cord. This added to their enjoyment.|$|R
60|$|She {{moved off}} {{slowly toward the}} house. His voice subdued her. Working alone out there had {{rendered}} him savage; he {{was not to be}} pushed any farther. She knew by the tone of his voice that he must not be assaulted. She <b>slipped</b> on her <b>shoes</b> and a shawl, and came back where he was working, and took a seat on a saw-horse.|$|R
60|$|With that I scuttled {{down the}} {{companion}} {{with all the}} noise I could, <b>slipped</b> off my <b>shoes,</b> ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the forecastle ladder, and popped my {{head out of the}} fore companion. I knew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution possible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true.|$|R
60|$|Just then Queen Cor, {{angry at}} {{being made to}} wait for her whip with the seven lashes, rushed into the room to find Inga. Seeing the boy sitting upon the floor beside Zella, the woman sprang toward him to beat him with her clenched fists; but Inga had now <b>slipped</b> on the <b>shoe</b> and the Queen's blows could not reach his body.|$|R
60|$|During {{the fight}} the Romans had, several times, nearly {{penetrated}} into the Temple. Indeed, a centurion named Julian--a {{man of great}} strength, courage, and skill at arms--had charged the Jews with such fury {{that he had made}} his way, alone, as far as the inner court; when his mailed <b>shoes</b> <b>slipped</b> on the marble pavement, and he fell; and the Jews, rushing back, slew him--after a desperate resistance, to the end.|$|R
25|$|Some {{designs of}} dress shoes {{can be worn}} by either gender. The {{majority}} of dress shoes have an upper covering, commonly made of leather, enclosing most of the lower foot, but not covering the ankles. This {{upper part of the}} shoe is often made without apertures or openings, but may also be made with openings or even itself consist of a series of straps, e.g. an open toe featured in women's shoes. Shoes with uppers made high to cover the ankles are also available; a shoe with the upper rising above the ankle is usually considered a boot but certain styles may be referred to as high-topped shoes or high-tops. Usually, a high-topped shoe is secured by laces or zippers, although some styles have elastic inserts to ease <b>slipping</b> the <b>shoe</b> on.|$|R
6000|$|... "He'd do somethin', but what?" [...] Sparrer scowled in labored thought. The fox {{was somewhere}} {{between him and}} the cabin. Should he turn back on the chance that he would jump the animal somewhere on the way and get a running shot? [...] "No chance," [...] he decided, remembering the clack of his shoes in walking. [...] "He'd hear me a mile." [...] He <b>slipped</b> his <b>shoes</b> off and rose to his feet. The crust bore him, for he was a light weight. Then he took a {{comprehensive}} survey of his surroundings. There was one other chance. The fox might return. He would soon reach the lower edge of the swamp and failing to make a kill might decide to try his luck down wind in {{the main body of the}} swamp.|$|R
50|$|While at the Toronto West Detention Centre, he staged two hunger strikes - a 39-day {{fast that}} succeeded in {{ensuring}} winter clothing and shoes {{in his cell}} during the winter, and a 73-day fast calling for an hour of exercise per day. During the first strike, guards at the prison had offered to <b>slip</b> him some <b>shoes</b> against the rules, but he refused {{and said he would}} wait until the court ruled he was legally entitled to them.|$|R
60|$|I {{suppose there}} is nothing pride can so little bear with as pride itself, {{and that she was}} punished for her {{imperious}} manner. Her retaliation was the most singular I could have imagined. She remained perfectly still until the carriage had turned into the drive, and then, without the least discomposure of countenance, <b>slipped</b> off her <b>shoes,</b> left them on the ground, and walked deliberately in the same direction through the wettest of the wet grass.|$|R
5000|$|As Gale leaves, however, she thanks Bernie {{for saving}} her life; and he impulsively replies, [...] "You're welcome." [...] She {{tells him to}} tell Joey the truth. John agrees to {{continue}} playing the part of public hero. While on an excursion to the zoo, Bernie decides to tell Joey {{the true story of}} the crash. After he does so, a lady cries out that her daughter has fallen into the lion's cage. Joey pleads with him to help, to which he sighs, <b>slips</b> off his <b>shoes,</b> and heads off to see what he can do.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{the fact}} was, {{that at that}} {{particular}} moment, John Browdie {{was sitting on the}} bed with the reddest face ever seen, cramming the corner of the pillow into his mouth, to prevent his roaring out loud with laughter. He had no sooner succeeded in suppressing this emotion, than he <b>slipped</b> off his <b>shoes,</b> and creeping to the adjoining room where the prisoner was confined, turned the key, which was on the outside, and darting in, covered Smike's mouth with his huge hand before he could utter a sound.|$|R
60|$|Hammocks and Cots.--I {{stated in}} {{previous}} editions of this book, that hammocks and cots had few advocates, {{owing to the}} difficulty of suspending them; but Captain M'Gwire's recent ingenious invention quite alters the case. His method will be easily understood by the annexed sketch. The apparatus is adapted for use on the wooden floors of houses, or ships, by the employment of eyelet-bolts or screw rings instead of pegs, and by putting wooden shoes below the staves to prevent their <b>slipping</b> inwards: the <b>shoes</b> are tied to the eyelet-bolts by a cord.|$|R
40|$|A {{protocol}} {{has been}} developed to obtain two-dimensional kinematic shoe data of football players in their training environment through high-speed video analysis. Such kinematic data can provide {{an understanding of how}} to better replicate the boundary conditions of football movements when simulated using mechanical traction and penetration test devices. As part of a pilot study, 11 youth academy players from a Premiership football club performed football-specific movements which were filmed at 1000 frames s- 1. The protocol required minimal set-up time and the area of the pitch to be filmed could be positioned in any part of the playing area, causing low disruption to the players. This aimed to ensure that the movements performed were representative of those carried out during competitive play. Results in this study are concerned with the kinematics of the shoe during contact with the ground for movements identified to be important in terms of injury risk and loss of performance (<b>slipping).</b> <b>Shoe</b> velocities and orientations were measured for subjects wearing shoes of different stud types (traditional round studs versus contemporary bladed studs) on two surfaces (artificial turf, in-filled with rubber and sand, versus a natural surface). All the parameters measured from the relatively small population of subjects had high variances and therefore few significant effects of studs and surface could be found. The data does however provide insight into the appropriate boundary conditions to be used in mechanical test devices. For example, in the forefoot push-off movement {{it can be seen that}} test devices should measure the traction forces when the shoe first starts to move, as this is when the player would lose performance, as opposed to the maximum traction which can occur after significant displacement of the shoe through the surface. Analysis of the orientation and velocity path of the studs just before contact with the ground shows that the studs could be aligned to enhance their penetration into the surface and optimise the traction properties of the studs. In order to determine the orientation and velocity of the shoes at crucial phases in movements force-plate data obtained in the laboratory should be utilised in future studies...|$|R
2500|$|Fashionable {{shoes for}} men and women were similar, with a flat {{one-piece}} sole and rounded toes. Shoes were fastened with ribbons, laces or simply <b>slipped</b> on. <b>Shoes</b> and boots became narrower, followed the contours of the foot, and covered more of the foot, in some cases up to the ankle, than they had previously. As {{in the first half of}} the century, shoes were made from soft leather, velvet, or silk. In Spain, Italy, and Germany the slashing of shoes also persisted into the latter half of the century. In France however, slashing slowly went out of fashion and coloring the soles of footwear red began. Aside from slashing, shoes in this period could be adorned with all sorts of cord, quilting, and frills. [...] Thick-soled pattens were worn over delicate indoor shoes to protect them from the muck of the streets. [...] A variant on the patten popular in Venice was the chopine – a platform-soled mule that raised the wearer sometimes as high as two feet off the ground.|$|R
6000|$|He chose what {{appeared}} {{to be one of the}} most used paths and followed this as quietly as he could. He soon found that still hunting on snow-shoes and with moccasined feet on bare ground were two very different matters. He was not yet sufficiently adept on the big webs to keep them from clacking as the rim of one shoe passed over the rim of the other. The harder he tried not to the more noise he made, it seemed. Clack, clack, clack. It was most annoying. He stopped to consider. Then on the impulse of a sudden idea he <b>slipped</b> his <b>shoes</b> off and dropped down into the path he had been following. Here he could walk without noise. The droppings of the deer, known as [...] "sign" [...] by all hunters, were numerous, and the brush within reach from the path showed indications of having been browsed on recently, and he found several places where sharp hoofs had pawed away the snow since the last storm.|$|R
