In March 2014, ITV became the first major broadcaster in the UK to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> to Twitter Amplify and Twitter introduced one-tap video playback across its mobile apps to further enhance the consumer experience.|$|E

50|$|Countries {{can become}} {{a party to the}} 1960 (Hague) Act, the 1999 (Geneva) Act, or both. If a country <b>signs</b> <b>up</b> to only one Act, then {{applicants}} from that country can only use the Hague system to obtain protection for their designs in other countries which are <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> to the same Act. For instance, because the European Union has only <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> to the 1999 (Geneva) Act, applicants which qualify to use the Hague system because their domicile is in the European Union can only get protection in countries which have also <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> to the 1999 Act or to both the 1999 and 1960 Acts.|$|R
5|$|Teams {{consist of}} 15 members who {{may come from}} {{different}} countries. Individuals may prearrange teams or <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> individually, in which case they are randomly grouped into appropriately sized teams. As of the 2013 contest, signup costs ran $19 per person with participation fees going towards Random Acts, a non-profit run by Collins that aims to encourage random acts of kindness.|$|E
5|$|All trips {{made with}} a SmarTrip card, with the {{exception}} of bus transfers and passes, are charged as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several trips in one day, or many trips, or many short trips, in a seven-day period or calendar month; however, SmarTrip users must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards or <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> for an autoload of the pass in advance. This is in contrast to the Oyster card system on the London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never pay more than the cost of a one-day pass each day.|$|E
5|$|As he {{was unable}} to travel during 1916, Kropotkin found himself in {{frequent}} correspondence with others, including Jean Grave, who visited Kropotkin from France with his wife. Together, they discussed the war and Kropotkin's firm support for it. At Kropotkin's suggestion {{that he would like to}} have been a combatant were he younger, Grave suggested publishing a document urging anarchists to support the war effort on the side of the Allied Powers. Initially hesitant, due to his personal inability to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> for active duty, Kropotkin was eventually persuaded by Grave.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Dean left ATP and became the head of the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), the organisation that provided entertainment to the British Armed Forces. Over the course of five months Formby requested to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> for ENSA, but was denied; Dean relented in February 1940, and Formby was signed on a fixed salary of £10 per week, although he still remained under contact to ATP. He undertook his first tour in France in March, where he performed for members of the British Expeditionary Force.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} United States citizen in 1946 after {{serving in the}} United States Army and {{achieving}} the rank of sergeant. In so doing, he lost his Canadian citizenship, as Canadian law prior to 1977 limited dual citizenship. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 he attempted to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> for active duty with the army's flying service (the United States Air Force was not formed until 1947), but was turned down for being too old. He therefore spent World War II in the United States Army and among his duty stations was Fort Lewis, located in Tacoma, Washington.|$|E
5|$|The Legion spurred {{several million}} Roman Catholics across the U.S. to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> for the boycott, {{allowing}} local religious leaders {{to determine which}} films to protest. Conservative Protestants tended to support much of the crackdown, particularly in the South, where anything relating {{to the state of}} race relations or miscegenation could not be portrayed. Although the Central Conference of American Rabbis joined in the protest, it was an uneasy alliance given the heavy presence of Jewish studio executives and producers, which, it was felt had inspired {{at least some of the}} vitriol from the Catholic groups.|$|E
50|$|The Palestine {{marathon}} in 2014 {{took place}} Friday April 11, 2014. The starting and finishing point {{was once again}} the Manger Square, Bethlehem and the route was covering the same stretch as in 2013. 215 runners were <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> for the full Marathon distance, 422 runners were <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> for the half marathon distance and 2492 runners were <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> for the 10K run. 35% of the runners were women and 39 nationalities were present. One of the runners was the famous photographer Jacob Holdt.|$|R

50|$|For {{countries}} not <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> to any convention, {{letters rogatory}} are still used. So for example, a plaintiff in the Netherlands which is <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> to the Hague Service Convention would {{still need to}} issue letters rogatory to Brazil, as the latter has not signed the Convention.|$|R
5|$|The {{downward}} {{trend in the}} number of unskilled jobs available throughout the country is continuing. The government believes that the extension of compulsory education until the age of 18 will mean many more young people will leave education in a much better position to find skilled employment. Speaking in March 2007, Chancellor Gordon Brown stated that around 50,000 teenagers would be paid a training allowance to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> to college-based courses, with estimates on the available number of apprenticeships available to double to around 500,000 by 2020, with 80% being available in England, which will be an increase from the current 250,000 apprenticeships available, offered by 130,000 employers.|$|E
5|$|The game went gold in {{the middle}} of October 2007. A demo was then {{released}} on November 8, 2007 on the PlayStation Network before its final release on November 19 in North America, December 6 in Australia, and December 7 in Europe. The demo was first placed on the North American store, and was initially region-locked such that it would only play on a North American PS3. However, this was later confirmed as a mistake, as the developers were apparently unaware that people from different regions could <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> for a North American account and download the demo; a region-free demo was released soon after.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} its release in August 2001, Funcom began {{offering}} free trial subscriptions, now common practice for other {{games in the}} MMOG genre. New players were able to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> for accounts that remained free for {{a limited number of}} days. This required them to supply some personal information, including a credit card number. After their trial period, players could either cancel their accounts, or keep them to continue playing the game at the cost of the monthly subscription fee.|$|E

5|$|Akeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old {{spelling}} enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle School, {{a predominantly}} black school in South Los Angeles. She {{lives with her}} widowed mother Tanya, her older sister Kiana, her older brothers Devon and Terrence, and her infant niece. Her principal Mr. Welch suggests that she <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> for the Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling Bee. She follows his advice and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she {{is good enough to}} compete in the National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she qualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old Mexican American boy and fellow speller. Javier invites her to join the spelling club at his Woodland Hills middle school.|$|E
5|$|Born in Waukegan, Illinois, Graham's first {{interest}} {{growing up}} was music. Encouraged by his parents, {{both of whom}} were music teachers, he took up several instruments: the piano, violin, cornet and French horn. Graham also excelled in athletics, and attended Northwestern University on a basketball scholarship in 1940. There he played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman and continued to study music. Graham did not take up football until his sophomore year, when Northwestern coach Pappy Waldorf saw him throwing in an intramural game and invited him to practice with the team. Northwestern's coaches were impressed with his running and passing, and Waldorf convinced him to <b>sign</b> <b>up.</b> Although football became Graham's primary sport, he also played baseball and continued on the basketball team. As a senior, he was named a first-team basketball All-American, part of a squad selected by news outlets comprising the best players at each position.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the destructive tornadoes, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour {{declared a state}} of emergency for 39counties. On April29, President Barack Obama signed a major disaster declaration for 29Mississippi counties in the wake of the Super Outbreak and another deadly outbreak on April15. This allowed residents and some local governments to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> to receive federal funding to repair damage incurred from the storms. More than 60members of the Longino Baptist Church assisted residents of Neshoba County with debris removal and cleaning; also providing refreshments. The Salvation Army established a feeding center at the Coy Methodist Church. Disaster unemployment assistance was made available for people who lost their jobs due to storms and flooding, starting on May17. By July, a total of $15,734,072 in federal funding was approved through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for victims of the April15–28 storms.|$|E

5|$|More than 9.2 {{million people}} {{signed up for}} care on the {{national}} exchange (healthcare.gov) for 2017, down some 400,000 from 2016. This decline was due primarily to the election of President Trump, who pulled advertising encouraging people to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> for coverage, issued an executive order that attempts to eliminate the mandate, and has created significant uncertainty {{about the future of}} the ACA. Enrollments had been running ahead of 2016 prior to President Obama leaving office, with 9.8 million expected to sign-up, so President Trump's actions potentially cost about 600,000 national enrollments (i.e., 9.8 million expected − 9.2 million actual = 0.6 million impact). Of the 9.2 million, 3.0 million were new customers and 6.2 million were returning. The 9.2 million excludes the 11 states that run their own exchanges, which have signed up around 3 million additional people. These figures also exclude the additional coverage due to the Medicaid expansion, which covers another approximately 10 million persons, as described in the impact section above.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{disembark}} {{in nearby}} Mombasa, as originally thought by the evacuees, the ships were ordered back to Oman—a five-day journey. The sailors and marines made {{way for the}} evacuees to share living quarters. When the chaplain of Guam asked crew to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> as guides for the evacuees while aboard the vessel, two hundred signed up within an hour, {{and some of the}} sailors even dressed up as clowns to ease the ordeal for children. At the request of the ambassadors, a formal session with the ships' senior officers was held to express their thanks. On 11 January, the evacuees were offloaded at Muscat, Oman. That afternoon, the American evacuees were flown to Frankfurt, Germany, from where they continued home.|$|E
5|$|Remaining at Rhodes {{during the}} 1940 {{academic}} year, Smith secretly {{made plans to}} leave for military service {{in spite of his}} instructions to finish studying. In June 1940, during the mid-year break from studies, he quietly travelled to the Southern Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, to tell the colony's director of manpower, William Addison, that he wanted to join the air force; to avoid being barred from enlistment, Smith did not mention his university attendance, and gave his Selukwe address. During his Christmas vacation at the end of 1940, Smith went to Salisbury again, and was successful in a second interview with an air force official and a physical examination. Early in 1941, having received his pilot course call-up papers, Smith underwent a final interview, during which it emerged that he was a university student; the interviewer briefly demurred, but accepted Smith when he insisted that he wanted to <b>sign</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
