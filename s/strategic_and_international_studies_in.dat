25|$|Foreign aid to {{the region}} is a {{difficult}} proposition, according to Craig Cohen, {{an analyst at the}} Center for <b>Strategic</b> <b>and</b> <b>International</b> <b>Studies</b> <b>in</b> Washington, D.C. Since security is difficult, local nongovernmental organizations are required to distribute aid, but {{there is a lack of}} trust amongst NGOs and other powers that hampers distribution. Pakistani NGOs are often targets of violent attacks by Islamist militants in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Due to the extensive hostility to any hint of foreign influence, the American branch of Save the Children was distributing funding anonymously in the region as of July 2007.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1989, the Simon Wiesenthal Center {{asked the}} Estonian SSR's public prosecutor's office for any {{information}} regarding Männil, who they {{suspected of being}} a Nazi war criminal. In April 1990, Rein Sillar, the chief of Estonian SSR's KGB, replied {{that there was no}} evidence about Männil, and all possibilities for obtaining such evidence had been exhausted. In December 1993, Efraim Zuroff, the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, mailed a letter of complaint to Lennart Meri, the President of Estonia. He asked for Harry Männil to be removed from his position on the council of Baltic Institute for <b>Strategic</b> <b>and</b> <b>International</b> <b>Studies.</b> <b>In</b> reaction, Henry Kissinger – not wanting {{to be on the same}} council with a suspected war criminal – left the council in January 1994. Following a hearing by the United States government in the same year, Männil's United States visa was revoked. In January 1994, Männil wrote to the council's executive director: [...] "These accusations are completely groundless and untrue," [...] he said. [...] "I will turn to the judicial authorities of the Estonian Republic for an official investigation based on these accusations." [...] In 1995, Estonian investigators combed their files for evidence implicating Männil, but found none. Jüri Pihl, the director general of Kaitsepolitsei (Estonian Security Police), commented on Männil's case: [...] "Harry Männil has no connections to any war crimes committed in Estonia during the Second World War; there was nothing criminal in his actions." ...|$|E
