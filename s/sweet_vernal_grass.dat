40|$|An {{ecological}} monitoring {{was carried out}} {{to find out how}} the vegetation succeeded on permanent set-aside fields over 18 and 21 years, respectively. Furthermore, the vegetation of field margins under permanent monitoring was surveyed over 10 and 12 years, respectively. The surveys took place on diluvial sites in the federal states Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Brandenburg. Plant diversity depends on the site, landscape and period of set-aside. Even after an extended period of setaside a few rare arable weeds like Anthoxanthum aristatum (annual <b>vernal</b> <b>grass)</b> and Consolida regalis (field larkspur) were found. A poor sandy site has been colonized by an interesting flora including plants typical of sandy dry meadow. Field margins adjacent to fields or permanent fallows partly showed considerable plant diversity. It depends on the site, landscape and management of adjacent fields and includes the sporadic but also permanent occurrence of arable weeds like Consolida regalis, Veronica triphyllos (fingered speedwell) or Camelina microcarpa (little-pod false flax). The long-term vegetative monitoring shows that permanent set-aside fields may produce remarkable plant diversity. However, 20 -years set-aside with self-greening supports the maintenance of rare arable weeds to a very limited extent only. Field margins could be used as refuge for arable weeds...|$|R

40|$|The farming of {{foothill}} {{country is}} carried out over {{the entire length of}} the South Island. The area consists of those lower hills and undulating clay downs most of which are ploughable. It is situated between the plains or lowlands of the eastern coastline- and the high, steep, unploughable tussock, scrub, and mountainous country which extends westward to the Main Divide. It is commonly known as the browntop belt on account of this dominant species, which forms the main soil coverage. The area of the browntop belt in Canterbury alone comprises some ¾ million acres. The altitude varies from a few hundred feet to some 1, 600 to 2600 ft. The rainfall is variable. In the higher altitudes it is as high as 30 ins. to 50 ins. Winters in these higher altitudes are severe and long with late spring growth. Also occasional falls of snow are experienced most winters. Under the conditions of high rainfall cultivation is difficult and because of its clay nature the soil remains saturated for long periods. In some parts wind blowing of the more silty soils restricts cultivation activities. These soils are low in humus and deficient in phosphate and lime. As such they grow poor pastures of acid-tolerating species of browntop, <b>sweet</b> <b>vernal,</b> and Yorkshire fog, but browntop predominates. Such pastures are suited only to store sheep production and give a relatively low carrying capacity...|$|R

40|$|General Description: Perennial herb with a stout taproot {{and short}} woodstock, stems 16 to 40 inches tall, glabrous to hirsute with short appressed simple hairs; racemes spikelike but {{elongate}} and open, many-flowered, the pedicels usually about 1 / 8 inch long; calyx 1 / 8 to 1 / 4 inch long, usually purplish-tinged, subglabrous to fairly thickly pubescent with tiny stellae; petals 1 / 4 to 5 / 8 inch long, pinkish-lavender. Identification Tips: S. hendersonii and S. hirtipes both occur {{within the range}} of S. nelsoniana. The calyx of S. nelsoniana is shorter and much less pubescent, the petals are shorter and the stem is much less hirsute than those of S. hirtipes (see general description for dimensions of calyx and petals of S. nelsoniana). S. hendersonii occurs only on tideflats; S. nelsoniana and S. hirtipes do not. Phenology: Flowering can occur as early as mid-May and extend into September, depending on weather and site conditions. Fruits have been observed as early as mid-June and as late as mid-October. Range: Regional endemic; southern Benton County, Oregon, north to Lewis County, Washington, and from central Linn County, Oregon, west to just west of the crest of the Coast Range. In WA it occurs in the Olympic Peninsula and Southwest Washington physiographic province. Habitat: The range of the species is all within the Western Hemlock Zone of Franklin and Dyrness 1973. It occurs along streams and in meadows and other relatively open areas, such as roadsides. It is generally found in areas where prairie or grassland remnants persist, such as along fencerows, drainage swales, and at the edges of plowed fields adjacent to wooded areas. Standing water is present at some sites. Associated species of the known populations include mainly weedy species such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), common velvet grass (Holcus lanatus), common rush (Juncus effusus), oxeye daisy (Chrysanthemum leucanthemum), <b>sweet</b> <b>vernal</b> gras...|$|R

This prompted searches in suitable habitats in adjacent portions of the Klamath Basin in Oregon, in the Gerber Block Bureau of Land Management lands and adjacent portions of the Fremont- Winema National Forest. Neither species {{was found in the}} 2010 or 2011 surveys. The 2009 - 2010 winter through summer was very dry, possibly causing dormancy of these species in soil seed banks that year.

Alternately, the species may truly be lacking from the Gerber Block. Twenty-six species ranked for conservation by the Oregon Biodiversity Information Center were found in the 2010 surveys, and an additional 10 species were found that should be considered for listing as conservation priorities in Oregon. A number of vascular plants and lichens were found that may represent taxa new to science. In vernal pools, 149 taxa (all but 9 of them native) were recorded.

40|$|The {{orientation}} {{of this study}} began {{with a collection of}} the grasses of Erath County during their flowering periods. Collections were made in the Spring and Fall of 1950 and 1951 to obtain both <b>vernal</b> and autumnal <b>grasses.</b> Identifications were made from the grass floras previously mentioned and checked against specimens in the herbarium of North Texas State College for verification. In addition, the list was checked by W. A. Turney, Conservationist, United States Department of Agriculture of Dublin, Texas. Finally, the list was compared with that prepared by W. M. Cory for the plant areas of which Erath County is a part. On the basis of the above identifications, a critical study of the vegetative characteristics was made and a key based on these features prepared. The width of the blad and characteristics of the ligule, roots, culms, and sheaths were used to distinguish each of the eighty-six specimens found in the collection area. A drawing was made of the longitudinal section of the juncture of the blade and the sheath of each grass. This diagnostic section includes the collar, ligule, a part of the blade and sheath, and auricles, if present. " [...] leaf 5...|$|R
