He stayed in Paris for nine years, performing at all the principal places of entertainment. Afterwards, he toured in many places around Europe (i.e. Austria, Belgium, Spain, Russia, Germany, England) with great success. His success was so great in Spain, matchboxes were sold bearing his portrait. His portrait (with political and social significance) appeared in well-known papers all across Europe, including Journal Illustre, Illustrationa <b>Spana</b> y America, Der Wostellung Zeitung, La Campana de Gracia, La Bombe, Le Jeune Garde, La Caricature, The Entr'acte, The Looking Glass, and The Northern Review. In 1889, when Trewey was around 40 years of age, he joined Alexander Herrmann in New York.

5000|$|Cleveland Bridge {{was built}} in 1826 by William Hazledine (Coalbrookdale Ironworks) with Henry Goodridge as the architect, {{on the site of}} a Roman ferry crossing. Named after the 3rd Duke of Cleveland, it spans the River Avon at Bathwick, and enabled further {{development}} of Georgian Bath to take place {{on the south side of}} the river. It was designed by architect Henry Goodridge to take the traffic of his day, horse-drawn vehicles and pedestrians, and was constructed using the warm golden Bath Stone and an elegant cast-iron arched <b>span.A</b> toll house was required to charge users of the bridge for the privilege of crossing. Rather than building merely one, Goodridge decided to install four [...] - [...] one on each corner [...] - [...] in order to maintain the absolute symmetry of his elegant neoclassical design. He provided each of these lodges with columns fronting onto the bridge, giving them the appearance of small ancient temples. This is what still gives the bridge its unique appearance today. Only one of the four (Number 1 next to St John's Road) was actually used as a toll house; the rest were always let to private tenants as small dwellings or shops. Given the small size of these dwellings (one room upstairs, two on the middle floor and one that would have flooded each winter in the basement) it seems extraordinary that the 1891 UK census clearly records a family of three people and two lodgers living in one of the lodges.|$|E
40|$|Digital speech {{processing}} has wide applications in modern day such as mobile phone communication, voice recognition and voice verification systems. Speech analysis {{is the most}} fundamental to these applications. In order to help students learn the abstract concepts in speech analysis, a software package tool, <b>SPANA,</b> was developed. For this version of <b>Spana,</b> six functions, namely, Plotting of Pitch Contour, Plotting of LPCC-based spectral envelope, Plotting of spectral envelope by FFT-based cepstral liftering, Zooming of the speech signal in time domain, Interactive Fast Display and Interactive Spectral Plot were added. For the Plotting of Pitch Contour, AMDF method was used in pitch detection In order to reduce error in pitch detection, a probabilistic approach was applied. Plotting of LPCC-based spectral envelope and spectral envelope by FFT-based cepstral liftering were integrated to the PlotSpectralEnvelope () function which was responsible for plotting the frequency spectrum and LP spectral envelope. As a result, the PlotSpectralEnvelope () could plot all the envelopes stated above on the same screen. The Zoom function was accomplished by creating an event handler, OnMouseMove (), to handle the “mouse move ” event. Therefore, blow-up of the waveform of the speech signal in time domain could be done when the mouse pointer was moved across the waveform of the speech signal Interactive Fast Display was completed by adding an KeyDown event handler, OnKeyDown (), which was used to response the keys pressed in keyboard. 2 Interactive Spectral Plot was done by reacting users ’ changes in poles, zeros and sensitivity of LP parameters by changing the LPCC-based spectral envelope <b>Spana</b> was developed under MS Visual C++ environment with MFC It is believed that the addition of these functions to <b>Spana</b> has taken a step forward in making <b>Spana</b> more user-friendly and helping students to learn speech analysis more easily. ...|$|E

Let Ax=b be a known (but possibly inconsistent) nearby system. Procedures for “solving” Ax=b usually replace it (at least in principle) by a nearby consistent system Ãx=b̃ of (hopefully) rank k, and solve that one instead. We consider consistent systems Ãx=b̃ with rank(Ã) =k such that (Ã,b̃) is the orthogonal projection of (A,b) on <b>span(Ã)</b> [i. e., the columns of (Ã┆b̃) are the projections {{of those of}} (A ┆ b) ].

40|$|Abstract. Motivated by {{importance}} of operator spaces {{contained in the}} set of all scalar multiples of isometries (MI-spaces) in a separable Hilbert space for C∗-algebras and E-semigroups we exhibit more properties of such spaces. For example, if an MI-space contains an isometry with shift part of finite multiplicity, then it is one-dimensional. We propose a simple model of a unilateral shift of arbitrary multiplicity and show that each separable subspace of a Hilbert space is the range of a shift. Also, we show that MI-spaces are non-symmetric, very unfriendly to multiplication, and prove a Commutator Identity which elucidates the extreme non-commutativity of these spaces. 1. Genesis and Justification B(H) is the algebra of all linear, bounded operators in a separable Hilbert space H over the complex numbers C, with the identity I. A subspace of H is always closed.

40|$|I en {{ambition}} att öka effekten och insatsberedskapen i den svenska försvarsmakten har stora omorganisationer skett efter det kalla krigets slut. Den senaste förändringen innebär att värnplikten läggs på {{is under}} fredstid och att kontraktsanställda soldater skall ingår i förbanden istället. Detta har medfört reduktioner i personalvolymer, troligtvis för att kunna bekosta löner för de kontraktsanställda soldaterna. Inom flygvapnets markförsvarsförband har reduceringen blivit så stor att vid en spriding av det svenska flygvapnet, finns inte tillräckligt med förband för att skydda samtliga baser effektivt. För närvarande används hundar som sensor för lokalisera fientliga spaning och sabotageförband vid och omkring svenska flygbasområden. Hunden är en väldigt kompetent sensor för att lokalisera personer och materiel men dess förmåga till att <b>spana</b> av stora områden under en begränsad tid är sämre. Laserradarn om den baseras på en UAV har förmågan att se genom vegetation kamouflage och rök från en upphöjd position. Därigenom kan den övervaka ett större område än vad hunden kan göra. Ingen sensor tar ut varandra men som komplement till varandra ökar de det fysiska stridsvärdet på båda enheterna. In an ambition {{to increase the}} effectiveness and response time in the Swedish armed forces there have been major reorganizations {{after the end of}} the Cold War. The recent change includes that conscript service is placed on a hold during peace time and that the soldiers in the armed forces serve in accordance with a contract. This has resulted in reductions in the amount of soldiers, the reduction is probably made to be able to pay for salaries for the contract soldiers. The Air Force ground defence units have been reduced to nine platoons so if an event of conflict in Sweden, or in Sweden's vicinity, resulting in a diversion of the Swedish Air Force around Sweden, there are not enough units to protect all the bases effectively. At today’s date the security units around the air bases use dogs as its primary sensor when they try to locate enemy reconnaissance and sabotage units in and around the Swedish air bases. The dog is a skilled sensor in locating people and equipment, but its ability to search the large areas around an air base over are limited because of the small number of dogs. Therefore, this text will look at the characteristics of a laser radar and se if it could work as a supplement to the dogas a sensor. The dog has the ability to short distances with great accuracy indicate persons and equipment with their hearing and sense of smell. Laser radar if it is based on a UAV has the ability to see through vegetation, camouflage, and smoke from an elevated position. This allows it to monitor a wider area than the dog can do. If airborne, it also has an increased ability to access places that are hard to reach by foot within a reasonable time. No one sensor offset each other but as a complement to each other they have the ability to increase the physical wellness of each other if they don’t have to work as hard as if theywere alone...|$|E
