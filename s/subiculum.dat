5|$|The term hippocampal {{formation}} {{is used to}} refer to the hippocampus proper and its related parts. However, there is no consensus as to what parts are included. Sometimes the hippocampus is said to include the dentate gyrus and the <b>subiculum.</b> Some references include the dentate gyrus and the <b>subiculum</b> in the hippocampal formation, and others also include the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. The neural layout and pathways within the hippocampal formation are very similar in all mammals.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.incarnatum are tiny, oval to roughly spherical, and measure 35–1250 by 200–450μm. The {{floating}} balls are sometimes enclosed {{in a loose}} <b>subiculum,</b> with a whitish surface that is byssoid (consisting of fine threads). The peridium (the outer protective tissue layer) is 18–30μm thick, byssoid, and made of clamped hyphae typically 2.5–4μm in diameter intertwined with dendrophyses (irregularly branched cystidia) 1μm in diameter. The surface of the peridium is hydrophobic, a feature that helps keep water off the growing hymenium during its development, and gives the fruit body buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{has been}} seen as central to the pathology of schizophrenia, both in the neural and physiological effects. It has been generally accepted that there is an abnormal synaptic connectivity underlying schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence implicate changes in the synaptic organization and connectivity, in and from the hippocampus Many studies have found dysfunction in the synaptic circuitry within the hippocampus and its activity on the prefrontal cortex. The glutamatergic pathways have been seen to be largely affected. The subfield CA1 is seen to be the least involved of the other subfields, and CA4 and the <b>subiculum</b> have been reported elsewhere as being the most implicated areas. The review concluded that the pathology could be due to genetics, faulty neurodevelopment or abnormal neural plasticity. It was further concluded that schizophrenia is not due to any known neurodegenerative disorder.|$|E
5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The flow of {{information}} in the hippocampus is largely unidirectional. Axons from the pyramidal cells (in EC layer II) perforate the <b>subiculum</b> to project mainly to the granular layer in the dentate gyrus (first synaptic connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate granule cell axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (second synaptic connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex (third synaptic connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E
5|$|Abnormally {{developed}} milk caps infested by the parasitic sac fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with a harder and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, {{so that they are}} more resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do not create gills; instead, the cap bottom is covered by an initially soft, white hyphen fungus, also known as a <b>subiculum.</b> Early on the mycelia becomes denser and takes on a white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other sac fungi, in which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other milk caps. Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different milk caps and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|E
25|$|The {{vascular}} arterial system supplying {{fresh blood}} branches into {{smaller and smaller}} vessels as it enters the brain surface and within-brain regions, culminating in a connected capillary bed within the brain. The drainage system, similarly, merges into larger and larger veins as it carries away oxygen-depleted blood. The dHb contribution to the fMRI signal is from both the capillaries near the area of activity and larger draining veins that may be farther away. For good spatial resolution, the signal from the large veins needs to be suppressed, since it does not correspond to {{the area where the}} neural activity is. This can be achieved either by using strong static magnetic fields or by using spin-echo pulse sequences. With these, fMRI can examine a spatial range from millimeters to centimeters, and can hence identify Brodmann areas (centimers), subcortical nuclei such as the caudate, putamen and thalamus, and hippocampal subfields such as the combined dentate gyrus/CA3, CA1, and <b>subiculum.</b>|$|E
500|$|The genus {{description}} {{is similar to}} the family description, but further specifies that the fruit bodies float, are sometimes embedded in a loose <b>subiculum</b> (a woolly or net-like growth of hyphae), and that the spores are reddish. The fungus has been described as an [...] "aquatic puffball", although a later review considered [...] "floating puffball" [...] to be a more apt descriptor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{superior}} region comprises {{two elements}} that were linked {{during a long}} time and were later wrongly separated: the nucleus anterior and the nucleus superficialis, or superior (previous nucleus lateralis dorsalis). The nucleus anterior, divided into several entities in non-human species, is undivided in man. The two, anterior and superficial, nuclei are separated from the lateral and medial regions by the lamella superior and are everywhere surrounded by a capsule of white matter, including the lamina terminalis. The second nucleus (superficialis or superior) is posterior and in succession to the first. The two are constituted in the same manner. The main difference is their mode of afference. Both receives information from the <b>subiculum</b> of the hippocampus but in one case indirectly and in the other directly. The efferent axons of the <b>subiculum</b> follow the fornix. At the anterior part of the fornix, part of them go down to the mammillary body. The neurons of the mammillary bodies give axons forming the thick and dense mamillo-thalamic tract (of Vicq d'Azyr), which ends in the nucleus anterior. Another part of the subicular axons does not end in the mamillary body as, {{at the level of the}} foramen of Monro, they turn posteriorly. Some of them end into the anterior nucleus but a great quantity end in the nucleus superficialis. The selective target of the efferent axons from the anterior nucleus is the anterior cingulate cortex, that of the superfial nucleus is the posterior cingulate, with some overlap. The axons of these parts of the cingulate cortex, linked through the large cingulum (longitudinal bundle located at the base of the cingulate cortex), return to the parahippocampal gyrus. This circuit referred to as the Papez circuit (1937) was said by its author to be the substrate for emotion. There have been many further other elaborations (including the [...] "limbic system"). Papez' circuit was in fact not close (at hippocampal level). In addition, the second nucleus, the superficial nucleus, not taken into consideration, has similar connections and participates in other close or linked circuits. The better known effect of the lesion of mamillary bodies, of the mamillothamic bundle and the fornix, if bilateral, is a particular (anterograde) amnesia (Korsakoff syndrom).|$|E
2500|$|The region {{separated}} by the superior lamella is the Anterior region (A). The region separated medially by the medial lamina is the Lateral region (L). Almost {{separated from the}} thalamic mass are the Geniculate bodies (G). The remaining isothalamus {{is made up of}} the medial region (M, medial to the medial lamina) and posteriorly, with no complete separation in man, of the posterior regio or pulvinar (Pu). The last two represent a huge medioposterior ensemble. The classical separation into relay nuclei, receiving [...] "specific" [...] subcortical afferences or association nuclei, which would not, cannot be retained as absolute. The lateral region and the geniculate bodies indeed receive strong lower [...] "specific" [...] afferences and {{can be seen as the}} [...] "sensorimotor" [...] part of the thalamus. The medioposterior ensemble, in most of its volume does not receive subcortical afferents and abundant afferences from the [...] "associative" [...] cortex but in some, essentially ventral parts, in fact receives subcortical afferences, such as tectal, spinothalamic or amygdalar. The anterior region receives a particular afference that is not entirely subcortical (directly or indirectly from the <b>subiculum).</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dorsal <b>subiculum</b> is involved in spatial relations, and the ventral <b>subiculum</b> regulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Subiculum</b> got {{its name}} from Karl Friedrich Burdach in his three volume work Vom Bau und Leben des Gehirns (Vol. 2, §199). He {{originally}} named it <b>subiculum</b> cornu ammonis and so associated it {{with the rest of}} the hippocampal subfields.|$|E
50|$|At {{the circuit}} level, the alveus {{contains}} axonal fibers from the DG and from Pyramidal neurons of CA3, CA2, CA1 and <b>subiculum</b> (CA1 ▶ <b>subiculum</b> and CA1 ▶ entorhinal projections) that collect in the temporal hippocampus {{to form the}} fimbria/fornix, {{one of the major}} outputs of the hippocampus. In the rat, some medial and lateral entorhinal axons (entorhinal ▶ CA1 projection) pass through alveus towards the CA1 stratum lacunosum moleculare without making a significant number of en passant boutons on other CA1 layers (Temporoammonic alvear pathway). Contralateral entorhinal ▶ CA1 projections almost exclusively pass through alveus. The more septal the more ipsilateral entorhinal-CA1 projections that take alvear pathway (instead of perforant path). Although <b>subiculum</b> sends axonal projections to alveus, <b>subiculum</b> ▶ CA1 projection passes through strata oriens and moleculare of <b>subiculum</b> and CA1. Cholinergic and GABAergic projections from MS-DBB to CA1 also pass through Fimbria. Fimbria stimulation leads to cholinergic excitation of CA1 O-LMR cells.|$|E
50|$|Rat studies {{indicate}} that lesioning of the <b>subiculum</b> decreases the spread of amyloid-beta in rat models of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease pathology {{is thought to have}} prion-like properties. The disease tends to spread in characteristic sequence from the entorhinal cortex through the <b>subiculum.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{also has}} direct {{connections}} with hippocampus region CA1 and the <b>subiculum.</b> Perirhinal cortex projects to distal CA1 pyramidal cells, overlapping the projections from entorhinal cortex. The same CA1 cells send return projections back to perirhinal cortex. Inputs from <b>subiculum</b> terminate in both superficial and deep layers.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{major source}} of input comes from the CA1 and ventral <b>subiculum</b> of the {{hippocampus}} to the dorsomedial area of the nucleus accumbens. Slight depolarizations of cells in the nucleus accumbens correlates with positivity of the neurons of the hippocampus, making them more excitable. The correlated cells of these excited states of the medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens are shared equally between the <b>subiculum</b> and CA1. The <b>subiculum</b> neurons are found to hyperpolarize (increase negativity) while the CA1 neurons [...] "ripple" [...] (fire > 50 Hz) {{in order to accomplish}} this priming.|$|E
50|$|Four {{component}} {{areas have}} been described: parasubiculum (adjacent to the parahippocampal gyrus), presubiculum, <b>subiculum,</b> and prosubiculum.|$|E
50|$|In mice, the {{projection}} to CA1, and the <b>subiculum</b> all come primarily from EC layer III.|$|E

5000|$|In rats, {{pyramidal}} and stellate {{cells in}} layer II of entorhinal cortex project through the <b>subiculum</b> of the hippocampus, {{giving rise to}} the name [...] "perforant pathway". These glutamatergic fibers form a laminar pattern and terminate in the dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) region of the hippocampus. Fibers arising in the lateral portions of the entorhinal cortex show enkephalin immunoreactivity, whereas medial portions appear to contain cholecystokinin. Additionally, pyramidal cells in layer III of the entorhinal cortex send topographic projections along the perforant pathway which branch into the <b>subiculum</b> and CA1.|$|E

50|$|This {{corresponds}} to areas 23 and 31 of Brodmann LP of von Economo and Bailey and von Bonin. Its cellular structure is granular. It is followed posteriorly by the retrosplenial cortex (area 29).Dorsally is the granular area 31. The posterior cingulate cortex receives {{a great part}} of its afferent axons from the superficial nucleus (or nucleus superior- falsely LD-) of the thalamus (see thalamus), which itself receives axons from the <b>subiculum.</b> To some extent it thus duplicates Papez' circuit. It receives also direct afferents from the <b>subiculum</b> of the hippocampus. Posterior cingulate cortex hypometabolism (with 18F-FDG PET) has been defined in Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
