2500|$|The {{group also}} {{provoked}} response from within. Many {{said it was}} a good first step in creating awareness about global economic issues, and creating drama and emotion around political issues (particularly as contrasted with Harvard's Institute of Politics). Others said that it picked up on struggles that already had momentum—for example, HEI divestment, which was already being championed by the Student Labor Action Movement. They stressed the importance but also the difficulty of raising awareness about economic injustice at a school for the wealthy and privileged. Some felt that the process was dominated by graduate students, particularly in its [...] "2.0" [...] phase that focused on the libraries. Some participants were already familiar with consensus decision-making; others were new—to its pitfalls as well as to its advantages. One student criticized Occupy Harvard for being too cautious: [...] "Occupy Harvard is so different from the activism I’ve done in Oakland. In Oakland people don’t hesitate to strike, they don’t hesitate to do radical <b>stuff.</b> <b>Here</b> we need to discuss every nuance before we act. I’ve had to adjust my style and be more patient." ...|$|E
2500|$|After seeing Armie Hammer's {{performance}} in The Social Network (2010), Guadagnino [...] "fell in love" [...] {{with him and}} cultivated his passion for Hammer and the movies he made afterwards. The director {{found him to be}} a [...] "sophisticated actor, with a great range" [...] and had him in mind for the role of Oliver. Hammer, who expressed his interest in Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash, met with the director years before the film went into production. When Hammer got the script, he almost turned down the role because of the nudity that was originally in it. [...] "I did want to pass. It scared me," [...] he said. [...] "There’s a lot of <b>stuff</b> <b>here</b> that I’ve never done on film before. But there’s no way I can’t do this, mostly because it scares me so much." [...] According to Guadagnino, Hammer was going to pass on the role through his agent, but then changed his mind {{at the end of their}} conversation. This is the third film that has Hammer playing a gay character, following Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar (2011) and Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait (2017).|$|E
2500|$|Unapologetic {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album holds an average score of 61, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews", based on 25 reviews. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian found it [...] "far more interesting" [...] sonically than Talk That Talk and stated, [...] "there's <b>stuff</b> <b>here</b> that's worth hearing, {{if you could}} untangle the music from the artist's personal life." [...] Fact magazine's Alex Macpherson felt that it has some of Rihanna's most compelling songs since Rated R (2009) and that, [...] "even when Unapologetic fails, it often does so in interesting ways" [...] musically. AllMusic's Andy Kellman opined that [...] "the only way to enjoy {{a significant portion of}} it is by taking it as pure entertainment" [...] and called it [...] "another timely refresh of contemporary pop music". Dan Martin of NME commented that, [...] "at its best, Unapologetic trades in daring avant pop", and dubbed Rihanna the [...] "most compelling of pop phenomena". Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone asserted that [...] "Unapologetics stark, shadowy R is confrontationally honest and sung within an inch of its life". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times felt that it [...] "makes the most of [...] talent" [...] and stated, [...] "even on the most vulnerable songs, she maintains her cool, never once verging on the maudlin." [...] Smokey Fontaine of The Huffington Post called it [...] "kinetic and musically varied", and wrote that it [...] "blasts the sounds of global, post-mod youth culture through every track".|$|E

6000|$|... "If they've {{got so much}} queer <b>stuff</b> out <b>here</b> in the barn, {{how much}} more do you suppose they've got in the house?" [...] {{questioned}} Fred.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, this is mighty funny," [...] he said, {{with a sigh}} of disappointment. [...] "Them fellers surely {{brought a}} lot of <b>stuff</b> in <b>here,</b> but they must have carried it out again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're all right, now! I reckon we've got the Commodore this time. I judge I've got the <b>stuff</b> <b>here</b> that'll {{take the}} tuck out of him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Here it is. I shall {{stick to}} wine; I don't care for that fiery <b>stuff.</b> <b>Here</b> is success to the campaign, and may we meet the French before long! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you call}} this fun?" [...] remarked Phil, sarcastically. [...] "Fun! to play the {{scavenger}} and bring this <b>stuff</b> up <b>here?</b> Well, I must say, I don't like your preference for a calling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go 'long an' {{bring that}} <b>stuff</b> up <b>here.</b> I never {{see such a}} man in my life. It's a wonder he didn't do it f'r two bottles." [...] She glared out at the sign, which faced {{directly}} upon the kitchen window.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pah!" [...] she exclaims, after smelling {{at various}} wines. [...] "What <b>stuff</b> is <b>here?</b> The beings {{who have gone}} before us could not have possessed the same nature that we do; for neither their hunger nor thirst were like our own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Waddington," [...] he asked, [...] "ith it {{the truth}} that there are one or two pieces of real good <b>stuff</b> <b>here,</b> thent in by an old farmer in Kent?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said the}} cook {{handling}} the basket with satisfaction, [...] "it is a pity, friend, {{that you did}} not bring this <b>stuff</b> <b>here</b> a while ago when we wanted it sorely and found it hard to come by in this barren, sword-wasted land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were talking}} of Debussy," [...] she remarked. [...] "I've {{got some of}} his <b>stuff</b> <b>here.</b> But I don't get into it. I don't {{understand}} it, {{and there is no}} use in trying. It doesn't seem altogether like real music to me. It fails to get hold of me, just as I fail to get hold of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's quite likely. He'd get the colour, sure, {{but when}} the creek that washed the metal out was running it dropped the heavy <b>stuff</b> only <b>here</b> and there. Anyway, the chances would be good enough, I figure. What {{policeman}} was it you told?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In Beverly Square. I say, mother, if {{that there}} grocer don't send us better <b>stuff</b> than this <b>here</b> bacon in future, I'll--I'll {{have to give}} him up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>stuff</b> {{is still}} <b>here,</b> keep to it, friends," [...] he said, and {{they worked on}} with a will till {{three of the five}} barrels were almost free from the mud.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you could}} bring that five {{hundredweight}} of <b>stuff</b> <b>here</b> and get it crushed up, {{and it turns out}} as good as you say, I could get you the money in twenty-four hours. I would not mind going half of it myself, and I should say that a quarter share would be more than good enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here it is, gentlemen! Here is {{the good}} liquor! Walk up, walk up, gentlemen! Walk up, walk up! Here is the {{superior}} <b>stuff!</b> <b>Here</b> is the unadulterated ale of Father Adam--better than Cognac, Hollands, Jamaica, strong beer or wine of any price; here it is by the hogshead or the single glass, and not a cent to pay! Walk up, gentlemen, walk up, and help yourselves! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a cruel trick you've {{played on}} us," [...] O'Grady said, with a sigh, as he {{replaced}} the empty mug upon the table. [...] "I had almost forgotten the taste, {{and had come}} to take kindly to the <b>stuff</b> <b>here.</b> Now I shall {{have to go through}} it all again. It is like holding the cup to the lips of that old heathen Tartarus, and taking it away again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} there's no flies on that <b>stuff,</b> an' <b>here's</b> the pie," [...] he added, {{as he took}} a parcel wrapped in brown paper from under his arm. [...] "I'm 'fraid it's got mashed a little, but I couldn't carry it any other way. Takin' the stew an' that, with what other things I've got, it'll be funny if your princess can't fill herself up in great shape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen--all of you," [...] he said. [...] "Our {{horses and}} outfits are {{hidden in a}} gulch several miles below camp. We've got to go that way. We can't pack any grub or <b>stuff</b> from <b>here.</b> We'll risk going through camp. Now leave here two or three at a time, and wait down there {{on the edge of}} the crowd for me. When I come we'll stick together. Then all do as I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know; but he's {{somewhere in}} the town. Give me your cash, an' I'll hunt him up inside of half an hour. The <b>stuff</b> is right <b>here</b> in the baggage-room, and you can ship it on the stage without any trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The freight thieves!" [...] ejaculated {{the eldest}} Rover. [...] "Don't you {{remember}} {{what was in the}} paper before we went south, and what was in again only yesterday? They have been missing freight from Carwell and Boxton and half a dozen other stations for over a year. The thieves must have brought their <b>stuff</b> <b>here</b> and then taken some of it from the packing cases and carted it away again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Shaynor {{returned}} to broken verse wherein [...] "loveliness" [...] {{was made to}} rhyme {{with a desire to}} look upon [...] "her empty dress." [...] He picked up a fold of the gay, soft blanket, spread it over one hand, caressed it with infinite tenderness, thought, muttered, traced some snatches which I could not decipher, shut his eyes drowsily, shook his head, and dropped the <b>stuff.</b> <b>Here</b> I found myself at fault, for I could not then see (as I do now) in what manner a red, black, and yellow Austrian blanket coloured his dreams.|$|E
6000|$|Wishing to {{give the}} old gentleman a chance, I dipped into translations. Some of these old fellows were {{not as bad as}} I had {{imagined}} them. A party named Homer had written some really interesting <b>stuff.</b> <b>Here</b> and there, maybe, he was a bit long-winded, but, taking him as a whole, there was [...] "go" [...] in him. There was another of them--Ovid was his name. He could tell a story, Ovid could. He had imagination. He was almost as good as [...] "Robinson Crusoe." [...] I thought it would please my professor, telling him that I was reading these, his favourite authors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "this is the position. The gentlemen you {{mentioned}} can land their <b>stuff</b> near <b>here</b> {{and get it}} away through the bush easily; that is, if you'll lie by and take no hand against them. There are other routes, but they're longer and more difficult, and my friends would rather stick to this one if it's possible. The question is how can they make it worth your while to shut your eyes and leave them alone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Cordin' to the slat of <b>stuff</b> you've got <b>here</b> on the table, I {{should think}} you'd {{been at work}} all the forenoon," [...] Joe said, approvingly, but there was the faintest {{suspicion}} of jealousy in his heart because the princess no longer demanded his attention.|$|R

6000|$|At this sultry noontide, I am cupbearer to {{the parched}} populace, for whose benefit an iron goblet is chained to my waist. Like a dram-seller on the mall, at muster-day, I cry aloud to all and sundry, in my plainest accents, {{and at the}} very tiptop of my voice. Here it is, gentlemen! Here is the good liquor! Walk up, walk up, gentlemen, walk up, walk up! Here is the {{superior}} <b>stuff!</b> <b>Here</b> is the unadulterated ale of father Adam,--better than Cognac, Hollands, Jamaica, strong beer, or wine of any price; here it is, by the hogshead or the single glass, and not a cent to pay!

60|$|In {{another moment}} she had {{discovered}} the trail she had made overnight and that morning by dragging firewood. It was now a shallow soft white trench. Instantly her despair and fatigue had gone from her. Should she take a load of wood with her? she asked herself, {{in addition to the}} weight behind her, and had a better idea. She would unload and pile her <b>stuff</b> <b>here,</b> and bring him down on the sledge closer to the wood. She looked about and saw two rocks that diverged with a space between. She flashed schemes. She would trample the snow hard and flat, put her sledge on it, pile boughs and make a canopy of blanket overhead and behind. Then a fire in front.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He is {{just the}} boy I want for our Cathedral school.' And {{then he went on}} to explain that a great reformation was going on. There was a foundation-school {{attached}} to the Cathedral, with exhibitions at the University, to which the Cathedral choristers had the first claim. There had been, of course, a period of decay, but an excellent Precentor had been just appointed, who would act as head master; and the singing-boys would be kept on free of expense after their voices became unavailable, provided that by such time they had passed a certain examination. Such a voice as Lance's was sure to recommend him; and besides, the Bishop said with a smile, he wanted to raise the character of the school, and he thought there was the <b>stuff</b> <b>here</b> that would do so.|$|E
6000|$|Beaming, he went on, [...] "I'd {{pull the}} rough <b>stuff</b> right <b>here,</b> instead of wastin' {{my time as}} a cap'n of {{industry}} by taking you {{up to see the}} scenery in that daisy little gully off the road; but the whole world can see us along here--the hicks in the valley and anybody that happens to sneak along in a car behind us. Shame the way this road curves--see too far along it. Fact, you're giving me a lot of trouble. But you'll give me a kiss, won't you, Gwendolyn?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Walter Bishop Sr. (January 9, 1905 [...] - [...] January 8, 1984) was a Jamaican {{composer}} and songwriter. His Swing, Brother, Swing was recorded by Billie Holiday with Count Basie, among other performers. His calypso, Sex is a Misdemeanor, {{continues to be}} recorded. Other songs written by Bishop include, [...] "Jack, You're Dead," [...] which was a #1 R&B hit in 1947 as recorded by Louis Jordan; [...] "The <b>Stuff</b> is <b>Here</b> (and It's Mellow);" [...] and [...] "Bop! Goes My Heart," [...] which was recorded by Frank Sinatra.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is the place," [...] Master Plummer said, {{with an air}} of proprietorship; [...] "an' seein's you've got the kid in your arms, I'd better light {{a candle}} so's you can see the way, 'cause there's a lot of <b>stuff</b> out <b>here</b> at this end. I've been countin' on clearin' it up some day, but can't seem to find the time. Besides, it wouldn't make any {{difference}} to us,--it's only 'cause we've got the princess to lodge with us that I'd like to see it a little cleaner. Say, Joe, what is a princess, anyhow?" ...|$|R
