40|$|In February 2011 student {{representative}} {{volunteers from}} the Student Union at the University of Greenwich (SUUG) led an awareness raising campaign called ‘Focus on Feedback’. The representatives engaged fellow students in discussion about their use of assessment feedback both in their own Schools and as they passed strategically placed stands {{at each of the}} three university campuses. At the ‘Focus on Feedback’ stands the representatives encouraged use of the Educational Development Unit’s (EDU) Voxur unit for students to provide their views on the purpose and use of feedback. The <b>self-managed</b> <b>unit</b> is designed to capture short video clip vox-pop responses to questions posed via a pre-recorded talking head. In this context students {{were asked to respond to}} six key questions developed by SUUG/EDU to gain greater insight into National Student Survey outcomes which, both nationally and locally, have consistently proved weakest in respect of feedback. Forty students recorded video responses to the questions and these were analysed to identify emerging themes. This presentation reports on the use of the Voxur unit and emerging feedback themes. The self-contained Voxur unit provided a useful, if costly, method for collecting vox-pop data. Its use in this study identified the value of immediate video-based surveys of student views by students as means of gaining greater understanding of their perspectives. The students’ videoed comments afforded SUUG/EDU with additional awareness of the students’ viewpoints. They also raised questions about current practices. All students recognised the value of feedback to highlight strengths and weaknesses and to enable improvement. In line with Gibbs and Dunbar-Goddet’s (2007) work, this was most evident to students when inter-related assessment items were used across programmes of study. Students appreciated the benefit of peer discussion and feedback to supplement their interaction with tutors (as Falchikov, 2007). However, difficulties in forging relationships with markers, who were often unknown to them or appeared anonymous due to automated or electronic feedback systems, lessened the possibility of growth through dialogue; an aspect identified by Nicol (2010) as essential to effective practice. The Voxur unit has provided a new dimension to our understanding of feedback and, although the findings from a small sample cannot be generalised, the vox pop approach has raised previously unconsidered questions about students’ perspectives which will now be considered when reviewing feedback practices...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. Patients {{discharged}} from a <b>self-managed</b> nursing <b>unit</b> are compared with patients from traditionally managed units on postdischarge outcomes. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING. Primary {{data were collected}} on patients {{discharged from}} eight nursing units in three clinical areas in one hospital from August through November 1990. STUDY DESIGN. A case series of eligible patients discharged from four <b>self-managed</b> nursing <b>units</b> (n = 140) are compared with patients from four matched traditionally managed units (n = 138) on postdischarge outcomes: perceived health status, perceived functional status, needs for care, unmet needs for care, unplanned health care visits, and readmissions to the hospital within 31 days of discharge. DATA COLLECTION METHODS. Patients were interviewed by telephone at approximately two weeks postdischarge, and data from hospital records were merged with interview data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses showed no significant effects (either positive or negative) of <b>self-managed</b> <b>units</b> on the postdischarge outcomes studied. CONCLUSIONS. <b>Self-managed</b> nursing <b>units,</b> previously shown to improve nurses' work satisfaction and retention, have no impact on patient postdischarge outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The article {{assesses the}} effects of {{consumption}} trends {{on the process of}} political identity building for individuals, focusing on a case study represented by a confederation of six cultural youth clubs. The ARCI confederation is a well known left-wing organisation, which has engaged in a profound reconceptualisation of its political stance over the last two decades. Our research assesses the cultural supply and demand of ARCI as it influences the political identity building of its members. The essential feature of ARCI clubs is that they are <b>self-managing</b> <b>units,</b> collectively deciding on their cultural production. Thanks to the quali-quantitative research strategy, the article is able to portray the differences between those who decide and those who merely consume. It thus provides valuable insights into the role played by the process of self-identification in the task of cultural re-production, and highlights the importance of the circular relationship between consumption trends and group identity building...|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{complex issues}} {{relating}} to an ageing population are confronting governments, communities and individuals (APC 2011). This is a common concern in most developed countries and one where IS can play a significant role. Some {{studies have suggested that}} social well-being could be enhanced by participation in online activities (ADHA 2011). Reports in aged care research literature indicate that loneliness and isolation are among the main problems encountered by people living well into their 80 s and 90 s (Coughlan 2011). Those still in their home receive basic medical and support services, sometimes via the Internet, but their lack of mobility restricts their ability to interact socially. Those who move into independent <b>self-managed</b> <b>units</b> or full-residential institutions are often dislocated from family and friends. Social technology offers a flexible mechanism for addressing the isolation experienced by many senior citizens. As the needs and capabilities of this group may vary considerably, developing social information systems in this area represents a complex challenge. Meeting this challenge fits well with the theoretical approach to the development of social information systems discussed and illustrated in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Human {{beings are}} both the slaves and {{the masters of}} the {{ecosystems}} in which they live. This paper examines the interrelationship between economic decision-making hierarchies and ecological hierarchies. Conditions under which discontinuous changes can occur are presented both for top-down and bottom-up causes. Appropriate institutional arrangements for minimizing ecological disruption are analyzed and depend {{on the nature of}} the relationship between the economic and ecological hierarchies. In some cases this will involve <b>self-managed</b> economic <b>units</b> operating at the appropriate level of the ecological hierarchy. ...|$|R
40|$|IT-support for {{adaptation}} of complex systems is widely available if {{the environment is}} predictable, the possible actions are limited and repeatable, the system is homogeneous in organisation, or the system is centralised. The domain of crisis management, however, violates all of these conditions. Crises are highly dynamic and chaotic, therefore solutions differ not only from one crisis to another, but a solution has to be continuously adapted {{to changes in the}} situation. Since in general multiple autonomous organisations are involved in dealing with a crisis, coordination of crisis response units is inherently distributed. This paper [1] proposes the Generic Reflective Autonomous Management (GRAM) architecture to support continuous {{adaptation of}} complex systems involving multiple organisations. The GRAM architecture respects differentiations in structure, goals and strategies within the different organisations. An autonomous entity, as shown in Figure 1, is modelled as a reflective <b>self-managing</b> <b>unit</b> and an organization as a layered composition of such units, as shown in Figure 2. At each layer a specific locally adequate management principle is be deployed. The exchange of policies and service level agreements between the layers is supported as well as the exchange of SLA and coordination information between layers of different organizations. A first approach to test and validate the GRAM Architecture is reported in this paper, bases on a prototype that integrates two different system management systems. The focus of the example scenari...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a longitudinal, empirical {{view of the}} multifaceted and reciprocal processes of organizational learning {{in a context of}} self-managed teams. Organizational learning is seen as a social construction between people and actions in a work setting. The notion of learning as situated (Brown & Duguid 1989, Lave& Wenger 1991, Gherardi & al. 1998, Easterby-Smith & Araujo 1999, Abma 2003) opens up the possibility for placing the focus of research on learning in the community rather than in individual learning processes. Further, in studying processes in their social context, we cannot avoid taking power relations into consideration (Contu & Willmott 2003). The study is based on an action research with a methodology close to the ‘democratic dialogue’ presented by Gustavsen (2001). This gives a ground for research into how the learning discourse developed in the case study organization over a period of 5 years, during which time the company abandoned a middle management level of hierarchy and the teams had {{to figure out how to}} work as <b>self-managed</b> <b>units.</b> This paper discusses the (re) construction of power relations and its role in organizational learning. Power relations are discussed both in vertical and horizontal work relations. A special emphasis is placed on the dialectic between managerial aims and the space for reflection on the side of employees. I argue that learning is crucial in the search for the limits for empowerment and that these limits are negotiated both in actions and speech. This study unfolds a purpose-oriented learning process, constructing an open dialogue, and describes a favourable context for creative, knowledge building communities. organizational learning; self-managed teams...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the influence of}} Eugen Dühring’s 1876 model of economic communes {{on the development of}} a peculiar non-Marxian stream of market socialist models, characterized {{by the fact that the}} <b>self-managed</b> production <b>units</b> are open. In the 1934 Breit and Lange model of market socialism, the organization of the economy is thought to be in the form of large self-management trusts, whose market power is limited by openness. Very similar features can also be found in Franz Oppenheimer’s previous model of industrial cooperatives. Herztka’s Freeland model of settlement cooperatives represents another development of Dühring’s original blueprint. Through Oppenheimer, Dühring’s ideas paradoxically exerted an intellectual influence on the initial institutional form of Jewish settlements in Palestine. Otherwise Dühring’s model of economic communes shows remarkable similitude with Mao’s organization of the Chinese economy, pointing to a possible influence through the extensive quotes in Engels’ AntiDühring. Co-operatives, Economic theory, Socialism...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCities of {{emerging}} economies are their engines of growth, because if villages cater to agriculture and allied activities, then cities {{to the industry}} and service sector. The influx of FDI, expansion of markets, international assistance and aid, globalization, etc. all contribute to the rapid urbanisation and simultaneously to the problems associated therewith. With the premature expansion of cities, {{in the absence of}} proper planning and preparedness, the challenges and repercussions of this haphazard growth become more evident and serious. The paper deal with the analysis of the problems associated with rapid urbanization, and seeks a possible and practical solution in the form of townships, for such ballooning cities. These townships with “walk to work” concept, built up with public-private-partnership, integrated in nature can be the future of these cities. They will be self-sufficient, <b>self-managed</b> and self-governed <b>units,</b> with well defined and well designed residential, commercial, retail and recreational areas; self owned and created infrastructure, integrated waste management systems, water resource management systems, and other amenities in place thus reducing the pressure on the local governing bodies and the city resources. Understanding and acknowledging the role and importance of these Townships in development of sustainable cities, the emerging economies have Special Township Policies in order. India is one such country where four states, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Rajasthan, have their own Township Policies. The objective is to create intelligent cities, with smarter plans, better built-environment and happier citizens...|$|R
