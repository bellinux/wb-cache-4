The aircraft served with the USFS from June 5, 1951 to August 4, 1959, when it crashed and burned while landing at the Moose Creek <b>spike</b> <b>camp</b> airstrip in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, Idaho, 50 miles west of Missoula, killing two smokejumpers and a Nez Perce National Forest supervisor.|$|E
50|$|The 1½ story log {{building}} {{was designed by}} the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Design. Built as a barn, it became a patrol cabin in 1945. It was built by workers from CCC Hot Springs Camp #NP-3 or Jenny Lake Camp #NP-4, working out of the Phelps Lake <b>Spike</b> <b>Camp.</b> A proposed cabin to house trail maintenance tools and personnel was never completed, so the barn was converted to that purpose shortly after the CCC was dissolved. In the 1950s it briefly housed a seasonal ranger station.|$|E
5000|$|While a {{fire camp}} is {{technically}} {{separate from the}} Incident Command Post and Incident Base it is common practice in U.S. wildland firefighting {{to set up the}} fire camp at the Incident Command post or Incident Base. <b>Spike</b> <b>Camps</b> are satellites of the main fire camp, and generally draw their supplies and food from the main camp while providing their own sanitation facilities. <b>Spike</b> <b>Camps</b> are used to support operation areas that require personnel to travel extended distances to return to the main camp. They are generally seen as a safety measure to prevent excessive fatigue, and reduce the probability of a collision with a civilian vehicle or stationary object.|$|R

5000|$|The first smokejumper {{training}} camp was {{located at the}} Seeley Lake Ranger Station, over sixty miles northeast of Missoula. The training relocated to Camp Menard in July 1943. Here, when not fighting fires, the men spent much time putting up hay to feed the hundreds of pack mules that carried supplies and equipment to guard stations and fire locations. In order to work fires, men, organized into squads of eight to fifteen, were stationed at six strategic points, also known as [...] "spike camps": Seeley Lake, Big Prairie and Ninemile in Montana; Moose Creek and McCall in Idaho; and Redwood Ranger Station in southwestern Oregon {{at the edge of}} Cave Junction. The men worked from other <b>spike</b> <b>camps</b> as well, including some in Washington State.|$|R

50|$|The first Blobs {{were made}} by a company in Texas. They decided to no longer {{manufacturer}} them but by this time they had already become very popular in many <b>camps.</b> <b>Spike</b> White of Kanakuk Kamps in Branson, Missouri brought an old single ply version of the Blob {{that had been made}} in Texas to Jack and Lorie Hunt with Springfield Special Products in 1985 {{to see if they could}} manufacture it. They took it and made changes to the design that the Blob has today. It is a two ply heavy weight coated vinyl that comes in 25', 30', 35' and 40'. The Blobs are sold all over the world. There are distributors in several different countries.|$|R

40|$|Advance Publication first posted online on 15 July 2016 - Accepted manuscriptThe cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, {{are the key}} {{molecules}} controlling mammalian oocyte meiosis. Their {{roles in}} oocyte biology {{have been at the}} forefront of oocyte research for decades and many of the long standing controversies in relation to the regulation of oocyte meiotic maturation are now resolved. It is now clear that the follicle prevents meiotic resumption through the actions of natriuretic peptides and cGMP inhibiting the hydrolysis of intra-oocyte cAMP and that the preovulatory gonadotrophin surge reverses these processes. The gonadotrophin surge also leads to a transient <b>spike</b> in <b>cAMP</b> in the somatic compartment of the follicle; research over the past 2 decades has conclusively demonstrated that this surge in cAMP is important for the subsequent developmental capacity of the oocyte. This is important, as oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) systems practiced clinically do not recapitulate this cAMP surge in vitro, possibly accounting for the lower efficiency of IVM compared to clinical IVF. This review focuses in particular on this latter aspect - the role of cAMP/cGMP in the regulation of oocyte quality. We conclude that clinical practice of IVM should reflect this new understanding of the role of cyclic nucleotides, thereby creating a new generation of ART and fertility treatment options.

40|$|Originally {{developed}} to regulate neuronal excitability, optogenetics is increasingly {{also used to}} control other cellular processes with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Optogenetic modulation of all major G-protein signalling pathways (Gq, Gi and Gs) has been achieved using variants of mammalian rod opsin. We show here that the light response driven by such rod opsin-based tools dissipates under repeated exposure, consistent with the known bleaching characteristics of this photopigment. We continue to show that replacing rod opsin with a bleach resistant opsin from Carybdea rastonii, the box jellyfish, (JellyOp) overcomes this limitation. Visible light induced high amplitude, reversible, and reproducible increases in cAMP in mammalian cells expressing JellyOp. While single flashes produced a brief <b>cAMP</b> <b>spike,</b> repeated stimulation could sustain elevated levels for 10 s of minutes. JellyOp was more photosensitive than currently available optogenetic tools, responding to white light at irradiances $ 1 mW/cm 2. We conclude that JellyOp is a promising new tool for mimicking the activity of Gs-coupled G protein coupled receptors with fine spatiotemporal resolution...|$|R
40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{exposure to}} smoke from wildland and prescribed fires encountered by wildland firefighters. Smoke from vegetation {{as well as}} off-gasses from equipment such as chain saws, pumps, and drip torches are accounted for. Section II {{provides an overview of}} industrial hygiene science and techniques. Section III is a discussion and literature review of the components in wildland smoke, and section IV identifies the health concerns associated with smoke inhalation and a review of the current literature on exposure to inhalation irritants. Section V covers research that has been done on wildland firefighter smoke exposure. Section VI is an overview of the Wildland Firefighter Smoke Exposure Study, a project I have managed since 2009. This final section describes the objectives, methods, data collection, and analysis of the study. In its entirety, this report can be used to identify locations, times, and firefighter activities that have a high probability of causing high exposures as well as to identify management actions that can mitigate these exposures. Wildland firefighters work in a dynamic environment and are often faced with a variety of hazards from fire to fire and shift to shift. One of the most common, but often overlooked, hazards is exposure to potentially harmful levels of contaminants in wildland smoke. This may also be one of the least understood risks of wildland firefighting (Reisen et al., 2009). With a growing body of information regarding the potential health effects of vegetative smoke to respiratory and cardiovascular systems, it became apparent to United States Forest Service (USFS) fire management officials that more research needed to be done. The USFS realized the need for current, valid data to accurately assess the exposure wildland firefighters and personnel at fire camps experience during their work shift. Unlike municipal firefighters, wildland firefighters do not wear respiratory protection equipment such as a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). Without SCBA, wildland firefighters are subject to exposure from a variety of inhalation irritants ranging from carbon monoxide, aldehydes, particulate matter, crystalline silica, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Some of the compounds in wildland fire smoke are known or suspected carcinogens. Health effects include short-term conditions such as headaches, fatigue, and nausea, while long-term health effects may include an increased risk of cardio-vascular disease. In order to assess the long-term risks associated with wildland firefighting, a comprehensive study of exposure was necessary. By identifying the conditions and activities that lead to high exposure, firefighters and fire managers can be better prepared to reduce these exposures. This study focused on wildland firefighters engaged in the suppression of wildland fires and working on prescribed fires primarily on federally-managed lands (forests and rangelands) throughout the United States. Study subjects included any firefighter employed by the following federal land management agencies: US Forest Service, National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Bureau of Land Management, as well as employees contracted by these federal agencies. Firefighters employed by various states are also included in the study, as well as those engaged in initial attack and project fires. Study subjects also included fire support personnel who work at incident command posts (ICPs) and <b>spike</b> <b>camps.</b> Fire suppression and management of prescribed fires involves many different activities. In order to successfully account for differences in exposure among firefighters, these activities were monitored and recorded during the data collection phase...|$|R
50|$|Hilary is {{somewhat}} defiantly {{in the latter}} <b>camp.</b> <b>Spike</b> and another candidate for the job, Amal, are in the former. Hilary, we soon learn, has given away an unwanted daughter to adoptive parents. A few years later she will learn that the name she gave her daughter at birth, Catherine, is the same that Jerry Krohl, {{the founder of the}} company, and his wife gave the baby they adopted, now called Cathy. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} two girls are about the same age, brings the “hard problem” into focus. If they turn out to be the same girl, can the statistically improbable intersection in this way of Krohl’s adopted daughter with her birth mother be simply a million-to-one chance or can it only be explained as a miracle brought about by Hilary’s nightly prayers or some other beneficent force? The play is nearly all dialogue exploring the ramifications of this question. There is really only one dramatic action.

40|$|Automation can vastly {{reduce the}} cost of {{experimental}} labor and thus facilitate high experimental throughput, but little off-the-shelf hardware for the automation of illumination experiments is commercially available. Here, we use inexpensive open-source electronics to add programmable illumination capabilities to a multimode microplate reader. We deploy this setup to characterize light-triggered phenomena in three different sensory photoreceptors. First, we study the photoactivation of Arabidopsis thaliana phytochrome B by light of different wavelengths. Second, we investigate the dark-state recovery kinetics of the Synechocystis sp. blue-light sensor Slr 1694 at multiple temperatures and imidazole concentrations; while the kinetics of the W 91 F mutant of Slr 1694 are strongly accelerated by imidazole, the wild-type protein is hardly affected. Third, we determine the light response of the Beggiatoa sp. photoactivatable adenylate cyclase bPAC in Chinese hamster ovary cells. bPAC is activated by blue light in dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal intensity of 0. 58 mW cm− 2; intracellular <b>cAMP</b> <b>spikes</b> generated upon bPAC activation decay with a half time of about 5 minutes after light switch-off. Taken together, we present a setup which is easily assembled and which thus offers a facile approach to conducting illumination experiments at high throughput, reproducibility and fidelity.

40|$|Strains {{carrying}} ras 2 (318 S) {{as their}} sole RAS gene fail to elicit a transient increase in cAMP levels following addition of glucose to starved cells but maintain normal steady-state levels of cAMP under {{a variety of}} growth conditions. Such strains show extended delays in resuming growth following transition from a quiescent state to glucose-containing growth media, either in emerging from stationary phase or following inoculation as spores onto fresh media. Otherwise, growth of such strains is indistinguishable from that of RAS 2 (+) strains. ras 2 (318 S) strains also exhibit a delay in glucose-stimulated phosphorylation and turnover of fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase, a substrate of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and a key component of the gluconeogenic branch of the glycolytic pathway. Finally Tpk(w) strains, which fail to modulate PKA in response to fluctuations in cAMP levels, show the same growth delay phenotypes, as do ras 2 (318 S) strains. These observations indicate that the glucose-induced <b>cAMP</b> <b>spike</b> results in a transient activation of PKA, which is required for efficient transition of yeast cells from a quiescent state to resumption of rapid growth. This represents the first demonstration that yeast cells use the Ras pathway to transmit a signal to effect a biological change in response to an upstream stimulus...|$|R
40|$|In yeast the Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway can be {{activated}} {{by a variety}} of nutrients. Fermentable sugars, like glucose and sucrose, trigger a <b>spike</b> in the <b>cAMP</b> level, followed by activation of PKA and phosphorylation of target proteins causing a. o. mobilization of reserve carbohydrates, repression of stress-related genes and induction of growth-related genes. Glucose and sucrose are sensed by a G-protein coupled receptor system that activates adenylate cyclase and also activates a bypass pathway causing direct activation of PKA. Addition of other essential nutrients, like nitrogen sources or phosphate, to glucose-repressed nitrogen- or phosphate-starved cells, also triggers rapid activation of the PKA pathway. In these cases cAMP is not involved as a second messenger. Amino acids are sensed by the Gap 1 transceptor, previously considered only as an amino acid transporter. Recent results indicate that the amino acid ligand has to induce a specific conformational change for signaling. The same amino acid binding site is involved in transport and signaling. Similar results have been obtained for Pho 84 which acts as a transceptor for phosphate activation of the PKA pathway. Ammonium activation of the PKA pathway in nitrogen-starved cells is mediated mainly by the Mep 2 transceptor, which belongs to a different class of transporter proteins. Hence, different types of sensing systems are involved in control of the yeast PKA pathway by nutrients. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background During early {{differentiation}} of Dictyostelium the attractant cAMP is released periodically to induce aggregation of the cells. Here we pursue {{the question whether}} pulsatile cAMP signaling is coupled to a basic Ca 2 + -oscillation. Results We found that the calmodulin antagonist W- 7 transiently enhanced <b>cAMP</b> <b>spikes.</b> We show that W- 7 acts on an acidic Ca 2 + -store: it abolished ATP-dependent vesicular acidification, inhibited V-type H + ATPase activity more potently than the weaker antagonist W- 5 and caused vesicular Ca 2 + -leakage. Concanamycin A, an inhibitor of the V-type H + -pump, blocked the Ca 2 + -leakage elicited by W- 7 as well as cAMP-oscillations {{in the presence of}} W- 7. Concanamycin A caused an increase of the cytosolic Ca 2 + -concentration whereas W- 7 did not. In case of the latter, Ca 2 + was secreted by the cells. In accord with our hypothesis that the link from Ca 2 + to cAMP synthesis is mediated by a Ca 2 + -dependent phospholipase C we found that W- 7 was not active in the phospholipase C knockout mutant. Conclusion We conclude that the potentiation of cAMP relay by W- 7 is due to a transient inhibition of the acidic Ca 2 + -store. The inhibition of the proton pump by W- 7 causes a leakage of Ca 2 + that indirectly stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity via phospholipase C. </p...|$|R
40|$|Addition of glucose to {{cells of}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae growing on a nonfermentable carbon source {{triggers}} a rapid, transient increase in the cAMP level. The occurrence of this <b>cAMP</b> <b>spike</b> appears to be correlated inversely with the glucose-repression state of the cells. This was also observed for the hex 2 mutant, which is deficient in glucose repression and which displayed the cAMP signal constitutively. When {{cells of the}} hex 2 mutant were starved for nitrogen on a glucose-containing medium, they rapidly lost viability, similarly to mutants with overactivation of the Ras-adenylate cyclase pathway, Flow cytometry measurements showed that G(1) arrest of the hex 2 mutant under such conditions was incomplete. Trehalose accumulation, a typical feature of cells entering the stationary phase G(0), was very short-lived in the hex 2 mutant under the same conditions. These results are {{in agreement with the}} presence of continuous glucose-triggered activation of cAMP synthesis in hex 2 cells on a glucose-containing nitrogen-starvation medium. In the course of these experiments a spontaneous suppressor mutant, shx (for suppressor of hex 2), was isolated which survived nitrogen starvation on a glucose-containing medium much better than the hex 2 strain. It also showed normal G(1) arrest and much longer accumulation of trehalose. The suppressor mutation also caused inability to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources and absence of invertase derepression, and it was epistatic to hex 2 for these characteristics also. The isolation of this epistatic derepression mutation supports the idea that the defect in glucose repression of the hex 2 mutant is the cause of its rapid loss of viability during nitrogen starvation on a glucose-containing medium. Substitution of glucose for glycerol partially abolished the rapid loss of viability in the hex 2 mutant. These results suggest that the glucose-repressible character of the pathway involved in glucose-triggered activation of cAMP synthesis might have a physiological role in preventing overstimulation of cAMP synthesis and allowing proper entrance into the stationary-phase G(0) in a medium containing ample glucose but lacking another essential nutrient for growth. Such a situation might be quite common in the glucose-rich natural environment of S. cerevisiae. status: publishe...|$|R
