50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s integrated-circuit {{manufacturers}} {{were working on}} designing integrated-circuit matrix decoders. A typical early example is the SSM-2125 from PMI. The SSM-2125 is a complete Dolby <b>Stereo</b> matrix <b>decoder</b> (except for the surround delay) on a single chip, it allowed domestic decoders which used the same logic system found in professional decoders to be marketed to the consumer. These decoders were thus given the name Dolby Pro Logic.|$|R
40|$|A {{high quality}} 5 - 2 - 5 matrix encoder and decoder system offers the {{prospect}} of inexpensive compatible media for multichannel sound. The advantages to the consumer, music and film producers, and broadcasters, are obvious. This paper reports on a system which offers excellent 5 - 2 - 5 codec performance, while preserving or improving the balance, frontal perspective, and spaciousness of standard <b>stereo</b> recordings. The <b>decoder</b> provides two or four independent rear outputs, which are capable of complete separation from the other outputs for a single steered sound effect, and which preserve full left/right separation during music. Decorrelated signals such as music can be panned forward and back with full left/right separation. Frontal perspective and the balance between center material such as dialog and vocals and other material is preserved through careful control of the center channel level {{as a function of}} the center content of the input signal. This paper will present a mathematical description of the matrix elements of the new decoder, and discuss some of the psychoacoustic data on which it is based...|$|R
5000|$|To {{overcome}} this problem the cinema decoder uses so-called [...] "logic" [...] circuitry to improve the separation. The logic circuitry decides which speaker channel has the highest signal level and gives it priority, attenuating the signals fed to the adjacent channels. Because there already is complete separation between opposite channels {{there is no need}} to attenuate those, in effect the decoder switches between L and R priority and C and S priority. This places some limitations on mixing for Dolby Stereo and to ensure that sound mixers mixed soundtracks appropriately they would monitor the sound mix via a Dolby <b>Stereo</b> encoder and <b>decoder</b> in tandem. In addition to the logic circuitry the surround channel is also fed via a delay, adjustable up to 100 ms to suit auditoria of differing sizes, to ensure that any leakage of program material intended for left or right speakers into the surround channel is always heard first from the intended speaker. This exploits the [...] "Precedence effect" [...] to localize the sound to the intended direction.|$|R
40|$|The {{capabilities}} and thus, design complexity of VLSI-based embedded systems have increased tremendously in recent years, riding {{the wave of}} Moore’s law. The time-to-market requirements are also shrinking, imposing challenges to the designers, which in turn, seek to adopt new design methods to increase their productivity. As an answer to these new pressures, modern day systems have moved towards on-chip multiprocessing technologies. New architectures have emerged in on-chip multiprocessing in order to utilize the tremendous advances of fabrication technology. Platform-based design is a possible solution in addressing these challenges. The principle behind the approach is to separate the functionality of an application from the organization and communication architecture of hardware platform at several levels of abstraction. The existing design methodologies pertaining to platform-based design approach don’t provide full automation {{at every level of}} the design processes, and sometimes, the co-design of platform-based systems lead to sub-optimal systems. In addition, the design productivity gap in multiprocessor systems remain a key challenge due to existing design methodologies. This thesis addresses the aforementioned challenges and discusses the creation of a development framework for a platform-based system design, {{in the context of the}} SegBus platform - a distributed communication architecture. This research aims to provide automated procedures for platform design and application mapping. Structural verification support is also featured thus ensuring correct-by-design platforms. The solution is based on a model-based process. Both the platform and the application are modeled using the Unified Modeling Language. This thesis develops a Domain Specific Language to support platform modeling based on a corresponding UML profile. Object Constraint Language constraints are used to support structurally correct platform construction. An emulator is thus introduced to allow as much as possible accurate performance estimation of the solution, at high abstraction levels. VHDL code is automatically generated, in the form of “snippets” to be employed in the arbiter modules of the platform, as required by the application. The resulting framework is applied in building an actual design solution for an MP 3 <b>stereo</b> audio <b>decoder</b> application...|$|R
