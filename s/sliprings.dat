50|$|The {{generator}} {{is required}} to be rugged and capable of very high speeds, as it is driven at the turbine's speed, without reduction gearing. The rotor must thus be simple in design and there can also be no sliding contacts to <b>sliprings</b> or other brushgear. Although the power requirement for the missile may be a largely DC supply, the AC alternator and its need for a rectifier is still favoured for its mechanical robustness.|$|E

50|$|The Cotal self-changing gearbox of the 1930s was a {{manually}} controlled epicyclic, {{like the}} Wilson. The {{difference is that}} instead of band brakes, it used electromagnetic clutches. These two clutches each consisted of a central rotating disk (a simple steel pole piece) {{and a pair of}} coil-carrying rings, one rotating and one fixed (this coil could be considered as either a clutch or a brake). <b>Sliprings</b> were used to transmit electrical power to the rotating clutch elements.|$|E
50|$|For generators, {{the field}} current {{is smaller than}} the output current. Accordingly, the field is mounted on the rotor and {{supplied}} through slip rings. The output current is taken from the stator, avoiding the need for high-current <b>sliprings.</b> In DC generators, which are now generally obsolete in favour of AC generators with rectifiers, the need for commutation meant that brushgear and commutators could still be required. For the high-current, low-voltage generators used in electroplating, this could require particularly large and complex brushgear.|$|E

50|$|After dynamos and motors {{were found}} to allow easy {{conversion}} {{back and forth between}} mechanical or electrical power, they were combined in devices called rotary converters, rotating machines whose purpose was not to provide mechanical power to loads but to convert one type of electric current into another, for example DC into AC. They were multi-field single-rotor devices with two or more sets of rotating contacts (either commutators or <b>sliprings,</b> as required), one to provide power to one set of armature windings to turn the device, and one or more attached to other windings to produce the output current.|$|E
50|$|Cavotec Alfo {{standard}} spring reels {{are built}} from modular components, which allow {{a great number}} of combinations.

The springs are made from steel and are mounted inside a housing in order to avoid friction and wear. The slipring assembly is mounted in a solid glass-fibre reinforced plastic housing which withstands corrosion and mechanical wear.

50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the <b>slipring</b> end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the <b>slipring</b> end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the <b>slipring</b> end, from which the <b>slipring</b> end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage axial blower mounted on the generator shaft comprises a shaft-mounted sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing.|$|R

50|$|The oldest trams (1001-1005) {{controlled}} the motor current directly, through a <b>slipring</b> contact with five serial, four parallel and five braking steps.

The other trams had control current controllers, which was a 100 V power which controlled a contactor which again controlled the motors. Originally, the power was fed directly from the pantograph to the motors, via a resistance. From 1931, the trams were rebuilt with battery which fed the motors. Trams built from 1920 could be run in pairs with multiple-unit train control, via a cable with the control current. From 1943, plugs to connect the cables were not installed when trams were renovated. The maximum speed of the trams were 40 km/h when running at 600 V and 60 km/h when running at 1,200 V.|$|R

40|$|The RRR-robot project aims at a manipulator-like system (with three {{rotational}} {{degrees of}} freedom), {{to test a}} variety of advanced nonlinear control strategies. Since for high-speed tracking of complex trajectories, Coriolis and centrifugal torques form {{an essential part of}} the occurring nonlinear effects, the main requirement of this robot is to highlight these velocity dependent torques. In this paper the outlines of the manipulator design are discussed. By exploring the main requirements two important features of the RRR-robot are introduced: unconstrained rotation in each link (e. g., by using <b>sliprings)</b> and the use of direct-drive servos. Several types of direct-drive servos are discussed and a choice is made to use brushless DC motors. The iterative dynamic optimization problem of choosing appropriate servos is solved by using a rigid-robot model implemented in a symbolic manipulation program.

40|$|Abstract. The default {{solution}} for mobile robot communication is RFnetworking, typically {{based on one}} of the IEEE 802. 11 standards also known as WLAN technology. Radio communication frees the robots from umbilical cords. But it suffers from several significant drawbacks, especially limited bandwidth and range. The limitations of both aspects are in addition hard to predict as they are strongly dependent on environment conditions. An outdoor RF-link may easily cover 100 m over a line-of-sight with full bandwidth. In an indoor environment, the range often drops to a few rooms. Walls made of hardened concrete even completely block the communication. Driven by a concrete application scenario where communication is vital, namely robot rescue, we developed a communication system based on glassfibre links. The system provides 100 MBit ethernet connections over up to 100 m in its default configuration. The glassfibres provide high bandwidth, they are very lightweight and thin, and they can take a lot of stress, much more than normal copper cable. The glassfiber links are deployed from the mobile robot via a cable drum. The system is based on media converters at both ends. One of them is integrated on the drum, thus allowing the usage of inexpensive wired <b>sliprings.</b> The glassfibre system turned out to be very performant and reliable, both in operation in the challenging environment of rescue robotics as well as in concrete experiments.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{vibration}} control of flexible shafts {{by means of}} rotorfixed piezoelectric materials. The target is to realize compact solutions for the suppression of problematic resonant vibration at so-called flexural critical speeds. For analysis, parametric finite element models of flexible rotors with piezoceramic sheets and strain or displacement sensors are developed, where the number of degrees of freedom is kept low. Several mechanisms which can destabilize flexible rotors are quantisized, such as rotor material damping, dissipation of currents induced in rotor-fixed piezoceramics and active feedback control proportional to rotor strain rates. The effectiveness of low frequency feedback and feedforward control for {{the suppression of the}} unbalance response is demonstrated using analytic and experimental results. Emphasis is on the interaction between the dynamics of the rotor and that of the connected electronic circuits. The experimental setup which is used for validation is a flexible shaft equipped with piezoceramic sheets and strain sensors.
