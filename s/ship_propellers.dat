40|$|Abstract. <b>Ship’s</b> <b>propeller</b> wash induced scour is a {{well-known}} engineering problem for port structures along the shoreline. However, insufficient recorded data {{makes it difficult to}} justify that <b>ship’s</b> <b>propeller</b> wash induced scour is taking place in Malaysia’s major ports. This study reported the seabed condition of the two wharves in Penang Port using Single Beam Echo Sounder (SBES) data. The presence of seabed scour due to ship manoeuvring is investigated based on seabed data. The results showed that Penang Port is experiencing a severe siltation problem instead of <b>ship’s</b> <b>propeller</b> wash induced scour impacts...|$|R

The research aimed at verifying the correctness of results of numerical simulations performed in the model and real scale. The results of numerical analyses performed in the model scale were confronted with those measured in the experiment. Then, making use of dimensionless coefficients which characterise propeller’s operation, the recorded model data were extrapolated to real conditions and compared with corresponding results of simulations. Both the numerical simulations and the experimental research were performed for the same propeller load states. The reported research is in line with other activities which aim at developing advanced numerical methods to support the process of <b>ship</b> <b>propeller</b> designing...|$|R

In general Albert Betz is credited for this accomplishment because he published his work in a journal that had a wider circulation, while the other two published it in the publication associated with their respective institution, thus it is widely known as simply the Betz Limit.|$|E
