50|$|A {{repair kit}} or <b>service</b> <b>kit</b> {{is a set}} of items used to repair a device, {{commonly}} comprising both tools and spare parts. Many kits are designed for vehicles, such as cars, boats, airplanes, motorbikes, and bicycles, and may be kept with the vehicle in order to make on-the-spot repairs. Some are considered essential safety equipment, and may be included survival kits. In the military, personnel crossing large water bodies in aircraft may be equipped with a raft and raft repair kit. Other kits, such as those for watch repair or specific engine components, are used by professionals. Depending on the type, a repair kits may be included when buying a product, or may be purchased separately.|$|E

40|$|With {{the design}} and {{development}} of the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV) progressing toward an early 1990 initial operating capability (IOC), a new era in remote space operations will evolve. The logical progression to OMV front end kits would make available in situ satellite servicing, repair, and consummables resupply to the satellite community. Several conceptual design study efforts are defining representative kits (propellant tanks, debris recovery, module servicers); additional focus must also be placed on an efficient combination module servicer and consummables resupply <b>kit.</b> A remote <b>servicer</b> <b>kit</b> of this type would be designed to perform many of the early maintenance/resupply tasks in both nominal and high inclination orbits. The kit would have the capability to exchange Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs), exchange propellant tanks, and/or connect fluid transfer umbilicals. Necessary transportation system functions/support could be provided by interfaces with the OMV, Shuttle (STS), or Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV). Specific remote <b>servicer</b> <b>kit</b> designs, as well as ground and flight demonstrations of servicer technology are necessary to prepare for the potential overwhelming need. Ground test plans should adhere to the component/system/breadboard test philosophy to assure maximum capability of one-g testing. The flight demonstration(s) would most likely be a short duration, Shuttle-bay experiment to validate servicer components requiring a micro-g environment...|$|R

50|$|Earlier {{versions}} of WebPositive used cURL services {{but they were}} slow and had many other bugs, one of the majors bugs being that cookies overloaded at times. It became clear that cURL {{could not be used}} in WebPositive. It was then that Adrien Destugues, or PulkoMandy, was given a contract in October 2013 to work on WebPositive so that he could fix the bugs. This led to Destugues becoming the lead developer for WebPositive and HaikuWebKit. Destugues replaced cURL with Haiku's <b>Service</b> <b>Kit</b> in the core of the application, which was earlier worked upon by Stephan Aßmus and Christophe Huriaux in the Google Summer of Code 2010, and Alexandre Deckner in 2011. Destugues has also made big improvements to WebPositive's HTML5 support in WebKit, such as already implementing support for datalists and color input. Destugues' constant work on HaikuWebKit and WebPositive results in a faster WebPositive with fewer bugs.|$|E
50|$|Peter and Kit finally decode the poorly written sonnet, {{discovering}} {{that the first}} letter of each line spells SEND NEWS BY PEEL. They immediately associate this message with Sir Philip's old peel tower and set off to inform the Queen's Secret Service. After meeting {{the head of the}} Queen's Secret <b>Service,</b> <b>Kit</b> and Peter travel back to Peter's village in disguise with one of the Queen's spies, Tom Boyd, to follow a clue which leads to Sir Philip's peel tower. Tom is killed by the conspirators. Peter is captured but not before learning that John Somers, an actor in their company, is to shoot the Queen during the first performance of Henry V. This is part of a wider conspiracy to install a new regime in England, the rest of it is vague but they are evidently in league with Spain. He is taken for questioning to a deserted Ullswater islet but manages to knock out the guard. He swims to the mainland and narrowly escapes across the fells.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare both levels of performance and relationships between performances on cognitive tests in groups of children and adolescents in Canada and the Philippines with similar educational experience. A battery of eighteen tests, including the Ravens Progressive Matrices (1958), the Science Research Associates Primary Mental Abilities Tests, and selected tests from the Educational Testing <b>Service</b> <b>kit,</b> was used. The samples included 219 students from an urban center in Ontario, boys and girls in grades six and eight; from private, public, and Catholic schools, and 203 students in Manila from similar sources. The results demonstrate the existence of two general factors of intellectual functioning, one concerned with conceptual or relational thinking, and the other with forming associations. The Canadian subjects were superior on the former, and the Filipino students were superior on the latter. (author/SK) U. S. DEPIPTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCASION A WELFAR...|$|E

The dimensions are taken from the <b>service</b> <b>kit</b> drawings, assumptions and also using vernier calipers. The main idea of this project is to develop 2 -D drawings and convert them to 3 D by using computer aided software (CAD), Pro-E Wildfire 4. 0. Other goals were to design core cavity extraction of forging component for machining and also generate NC codes for machining process. Pro-E, a very advanced CAD software, helps to improve the Design with ease, do the Design, Drawing, NC code generation and Manufacturing process in one place which helps to reduce time and cost. It {{has the ability to}} interface with the CNC machine to directly run the machining process with less effort. Cosmos Works is being used for Finite Element Analysis.

40|$|The {{removal of}} nonretrievable implant {{components}} represents {{a challenge in}} implant dentistry. The mechanical approach involves the risk of damaging the implant connection or the bone-to-implant interface. This case report describes a cryo-mechanical approach for the safe removal of a nonretrievable implant component. A patient had an implant surgically placed in a private practice. When the patient returned to the restorative dentist to make a definitive impression, the healing abutment could not be loosened. The patient was referred to the Division of Fixed Prosthodontics (University of Bern, Switzerland), where the stripped screw hole was enlarged with a special drill from a <b>service</b> <b>kit</b> of the implant provider. Although an extraction bolt was screwed into the opening and the torque ratchet was activated, the healing abutment would not loosen. A novel approach was attempted whereby the healing abutment was cooled with dry ice (CO 2). The cooling effect seemingly caused shrinkage of the healing abutment and a reduction of the connection forces between the implant and the nonretrievable component. The approach of creating an access hole {{for the application of}} reverse torque via the extraction bolt in combination with the thermal effect led to the successful removal of the blocked component. Neither the implant connection nor the bone-to-implant interface was damaged. The combined cryo-mechanical procedure allowed the implant to be successfully restored...|$|E
5000|$|A {{major change}} to the Quadrajet was {{implemented}} for the 1975 model year. These newer carburetors are considered [...] "Modified Quadrajets" [...] or [...] "Mod Quads".

They were also equipped with a self-contained choke mechanism that no longer relied on an intake manifold mounted choke, and a number [...] "1" [...] {{was added to the}} beginning of their identification numbers.. The digits in a Quadrajet model type denote its features. For example, the [...] "E" [...] {{at the end of a}} later Q-jet model denoted that it had an electric choke, the [...] "C" [...] denoted a hot air coil style choke element. Original Delco <b>service</b> <b>kits</b> were once sold through both GM dealers and Delco distributors and were called [...] "Power Kits".
