A serological survey was carried out in the Emilia-Romagna Region (Northern Italy) in order to establish the occurrence and spread of coronavirus infection in farm-bred and free-living pheasants. Seven hundred and four sera were obtained during 1998 from 16 game farms. 275 sera were collected from 1995 to 2002 from free-living pheasants, belonging to a natural population: these were classified as “wild” and “restocked” (a few reared birds released in the study area). A blocking ELISA (Svanovir®) test was employed for the detection of antibodies cross reactive to Infectious Bronchitis Virus in sera. Seropositive animals were detected in 5 out 16 game farms examined, while only two free-living pheasants (a restocked bird and an unclassified one) were seropositive. These data confirm that the infection was present in Italian-reared pheasants, but the free-living sampled population appeared to be free from the infection. The authors emphasise the risk of spreading the infection to wild bird populations by <b>game</b> <b>restocking</b> activities...|$|R

25|$|Hunting {{often had}} {{elaborate}} preparations, such as fasting and religious rituals performed by medicine men {{before and after}} the hunt. In Lipan culture, since deer were protected by Mountain Spirits, great care was taken in Mountain Spirit rituals in order to ensure smooth deer hunting. Also the slaughter of animals must be performed following certain religious guidelines (many of which are recorded in religious stories) from prescribing how to cut the animals, what prayers to recite, and proper disposal of bones. A common practice among Southern Athabascan hunters was the distribution of successfully <b>slaughtered</b> <b>game.</b> For example, among the Mescalero a hunter was expected to share as much as one half of his kill with a fellow hunter and with needy people back at the camp. Feelings of individuals concerning this practice spoke of social obligation and spontaneous generosity.|$|R
40|$|Introduction of {{wildlife}} for <b>game</b> <b>restocking</b> is one major pathway of genetic homogenization. The redlegged partridge (Alectoris rufa, Phasianidae), a small game bird native to south-western Europe, is {{in high demand}} by hunters and natural populations are constantly supplemented by commercial stocks of captive- bred individuals. Also, in recent years human-mediated hybridization with congeneric chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar: Greece, Cyprus, from Middle East to East Asia) has been frequently documented in the wild and in captivity. This study attempts to evaluate the genetic consequences of intensive captive breeding and restocking in the A. rufa species. We investigated A. rufa genetic diversity by making comparisons in both a spatial (across the entire species’ range) and a temporal framework. We accomplished this latter by comparing modern vs. ancient partridges resident in museums and collected 1856 – 1934, well before supplemental stocking became common. Using mtDNA we found {{significant changes in the}} haplotype profile of modern vs. ancient A. rufa, and widespread introgression with chukar genes across the entire species range only in modern representatives, with the relevant exception of Corsican populations. However, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), as opposed to microsatellite DNA markers, showed also modern Corsican populations to harbour many A. rufa A. chukar hybrids. We conclude that captive breeding programs should make strict use of time-saving and comparatively low cost DNA barcodes to minimize genetic pollution, such as those provided by diagnostic RAPD markers. We also recommend that the active ban on import of exotics and/or hybrids be extended to non-local populations. Altogether this would represent a substantial step forward to preserve A. rufa as well as other game species subjected to similar intensive management...|$|R

We conducted a 2 -year study in the Camargue (Southern France) to investigate the influence of hand-reared Mallard releases on avian influenza virus dynamics in surrounding wildlife. We sampled Mallards (cloacal swabs) from several game duck facilities in 2009 and 2010 before their release. A very high (99 %) infection rate caused by an H 10 N 7 strain was detected in the game bird facility we sampled in 2009. We did not detect this strain in shot ducks we sampled, neither during the infection rates ranged from 0 to 24 % in hand-reared ducks. The 2009 H 10 N 7 strain was fully sequenced. It results from multiple reassortment events between Eurasian low pathogenic strains. Interestingly, H 10 N 7 strains had previously caused human infections in Egypt and Australia. The H 10 and N 7 segments we sequenced were clearly distinct from the Australian ones but they belonged to the same large cluster as the Egyptian ones. We did not observe any mutation linked to increased virulence, transmission to mammals, or antiviral resistance in the H 10 N 7 strain we identified. Our results indicate that the potential role of hand-reared Mallards in influenza virus epizootics must be taken into account given the likely risk of viral exchange between game bird facilities and wild habitats, owing to duck rearing conditions.

40|$|Background: The common quail, Coturnix coturnix, is a {{migratory bird}} hunted {{extensively}} across Europe. To satisfy this hunting interest, thousands of farm-reared birds are restocked every year. However, restocked individuals are not common quail but hybrids with domestic Japanese quail, C. japonica. Interbreeding between restocked and native {{birds in the}} wild allows the entry of alien alleles to the native populations, {{which could lead to}} the loss of adaptive phenotypes and behaviours, such as migratory drive. Sedentary individuals may face wintering conditions to which they are not adapted, suffering higher mortality. Some individuals have been observed to remain in northern latitudes during winter. Question: Does <b>game</b> <b>restocking</b> contribute to the sedentarization of the common quail population? Method: We sampled 42 quail during the autumn migration and 50 quail during winter in Spain. We genetically analysed them using a set of autosomal microsatellites and also sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region. We evaluated the proportion of admixed quail found and compared it with that previously found in a breeding population. Results: None of the migratory quail were admixed individuals, although two of them showed introgression of Japanese mitochondrial DNA. Among wintering quail, only three individuals had a genetic composition compatible with a farm origin, while the rest were common quail. Thus, the proportion of admixed quail during winter was not higher than during the breeding season. Conclusion: Restocking individuals with domestic Japanese quail ancestry is not directly associated with the presence of quail during winter in northern latitudes. The almost complete absence of individuals of farm origin among the migratory and wintering quail populations indicates {{that the vast majority of}} the restocked individuals probably die soon after release. However, the genetic composition of the breeding population has already shown that some survive until the next breeding season and introgress their genes into the wild population...|$|R

Consequently, {{they can}} {{transmit}} arboviruses {{to more than}} one host during the same developmental stage (intra-stadial transmission). By contrast, ixodid ticks generally feed only once at each parasitic stage (larva, nymph, and adult) and hence they have only one opportunity for tick-borne virus transmission per stadium (inter-stadial transmission). Under natural conditions, tick-infested hosts may die (from disease or other causes) before the ticks have completed their long period of engorgement. A laboratory model was used to investigate the consequences of premature host death on tick-borne virus transmission. We report intra-stadial transmission of Thogoto virus by the nymphal, male, and female ticks of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Tick-borne Thogoto virus infection caused viraemia and death of hamsters before the nymphal and adult ticks feeding on them had completed engorgement. The resulting partially fed ticks were allowed to continue engorgement on new, uninfected hosts (interrupted feeding). During feeding on the subsequent hosts, they transmitted the virus intra-stadially to susceptible hosts (hamsters), and to uninfected co-feeding ticks on non-susceptible hosts (guinea-pigs). Intra-stadial transmission, mediated by interrupted feeding, may help explain outbreaks of rapid and fatal tick-borne viral diseases, and the epidemiology as well as evolution of virulence, in a susceptible host population.

Surface soil samples have been analysed to find if there is any correlation between soils and vegetation. Following an examination of the vegetative means by which plants survive fire, a new approach to the problem of fire survival involves experiments on the effect of heat on seed viability and germination, a factor of critical importance to annuals and to the wide dissemination of perennials. The rotation of herds of cattle has led to the abandonment of a large number of bomas, the subsequent colonisation of which is studied in detail, and the interaction of fire and grazing is discussed with special reference to the apparent local increase in Acacia hockii.

The fossil dung was 14 C-dated to 1476 - 1632 calendar years before present and was confirmed as bighorn sheep by morphological and ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis. 12 S sequences closely or exactly matched known bighorn sheep sequences; control region sequences exactly matched a haplotype described in desert bighorn sheep populations in southwest Arizona and southern California and showed subtle differentiation from the extant Tiburón population. Native desert bighorn sheep previously colonized this land-bridge island, most likely during the Pleistocene, when lower sea levels connected Tiburón to the mainland. They were extirpated sometime in the last ∼ 1500 years, probably due to inherent dynamics of isolated populations, prolonged drought, and (or) human overkill. The reintroduced population is vulnerable to similar extinction risks. The discovery presented here refutes conventional wisdom that bighorn sheep are not native to Tiburón Island, and establishes its recent introduction as an example of unintentional rewilding, defined here as the introduction of a species without knowledge that it was once native and has since gone locally extinct...|$|R

50|$|With the three-in-a-row {{taken care}} of, Kilkenny {{set out to}} break Cork's {{seemingly}} unbeatable record of four championship titles in succession. Tipperary were seen as the main challengers to Kilkenny's dominance and both sides lined out {{against each other in}} the final of the National League. Tipperary stormed into a decisive lead as they took the game by the scruff of the; however, 'the Cats' clawed their way back into the game. At the end of normal time both sides were level. A period of extra-time followed, however, in spite of battling to the very end Tipp were beaten and Kilkenny won by 2-26 to 4-17. It was Brennan's fourth National League winners' medal. The subsequent championship campaign saw 'the Cats' line out against Dublin in the Leinster final. While many expected 'the Dubs' to be lambs to the <b>slaughter</b> in that <b>game,</b> Kilkenny found it difficult to cope. It took two goals from Martin Comerford to secure a 2-18 to 0-18 victory and a tenth Leinster winners' medal for Brennan. After a six-week lay-off and a thrilling semi-final with Waterford, Kilkenny qualified for a fourth successive final and the chance to make history. In a repeat of the league final, Tipperary were the opponents. For much of the match it looked as if Tipp would pull off a shock and deny 'the Cats' a record-equaling four-in-a-row. Two quick goals {{in the space of a}} minute, one from a penalty by Henry Shefflin, sealed a 2-22 to 0-23 victory. It was the fourth time in-a-row that the famed Liam MacCarthy Cup was presented to a Kilkenny team. It was also Brennan's seventh All-Ireland winners' medal.|$|R
40|$|<b>Slaughter</b> {{protocols}} for <b>game</b> harvesters {{are defined}} by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in South Africa in Veterinary Procedural Notice (VPN 8). VPN 8 stipulates that game animals should normally be eviscerated in a hanging position within 2 hrs after being shot, and if bloating occurs evisceration must be done as an emergency, within 0. 5 hr, or {{as soon as possible}} after bleeding by the game harvester. It would be beneficial to know if the concept of delayed evisceration has any deleterious effects on the microbiological safety of harvested black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou) meat. The objective of this research project was to determine if delayed evisceration has an effect on enteric bacterial translocation across the intestinal mucosal barrier into the abdominal cavity. Sixteen harvested animals were grouped together in groups A, B, C, D and E, based on a time delay in evisceration. After each animal was eviscerated, an 8 mm punch biopsy from the abdominal peritoneum was collected and placed into a 2 ml Biofreeze vial. In the laboratory, the biopsy samples were inoculated on blood and MacConkey agar plates and incubated for three days at 37 °C. The bacterial species targeted for isolation were indicator bacteria for movement across the intestinal barrier. The quantifiable absence of bacteria from the samples that were subjected to bacterial isolation in this study indicates that bacterial translocation across the intestinal barrier is negligible in black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou) exposed to delays in evisceration for up to 5 hrs. Evidence indicating that black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou) meat exposed to bloating and a delay in evisceration is not safe for human consumption due to bacterial translocation is therefore lacking.
