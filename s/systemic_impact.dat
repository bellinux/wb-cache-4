Government “green ICT” policies can be instrumental in promoting life-cycle approaches for improved R&D and design of ICT goods, services and systems. 	Innovative ICT applications enable sustainable production and consumption across the entire economy. The potential for improving environmental performance targets specific products, but also entire systems and industry sectors, e. g. construction, transport, energy. Governments can promote cross-sector R&D programmes, national and regional initiatives as well as local pilot projects. This is particularly important in areas where structural barriers, e. g. lack of commercial incentives or high investment costs, may hinder the rapid uptake of “smart” ICTs. 	Information {{and communication}} are pivotal for system-wide mitigation of environmental impacts and adaptation to inevitable changes in the environment. Governments can stimulate further research into the <b>systemic</b> <b>impacts</b> – intended and unintended – of the diffusion of ICTs in order to assess how ICTs and the Internet contribute to environmental policy goals in the long term.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} <b>systemic</b> <b>impact</b> of climate {{variations}} in a regional perspective using an interregional CGE model integrated with a physical model estimated for agriculture {{in order to}} catch the effects of climate change. The methodological approach adopted to conduct such analysis was developed in two stages. At the first stage, a profit model was estimated for the agriculture sector using econometric tools {{in order to obtain}} structural parameters for projecting the effect of climate anomalies physical on the production of agriculture sector (permanent and temporary crops). At the second stage, this projection is translated as a technological productivity shock into the CGE model to evaluate the general equilibrium effect of climate anomalies. Climate anomalies are defined as deviations of rainfalls over the historic trend and the productivity shock is computed to mimic the climate anomalies observed in 2005. The CGE model used in this study id the well documented B-MARIA model. This model recognizes the 27 Brazilian regions and the results are based on a bottom-up approach ? i. e. national results are obtained from the aggregation of regional results. The model identifies 56 production/investment sectors in each region producing 110 commodities, one representative household in each region, regional governments and one Federal government, and a single foreign area that trades with each domestic region, through a network of ports of exit and ports of entry. Three local primary factors are used in the production process, according to regional endowments (land, capital and labour). The results show that a general equilibrium approach can provide a better comprehension about the <b>systemic</b> <b>impact</b> of climate anomalies, suggesting the economic costs are higher than those that would be observed in a partial equilibrium analysis. In addition, intersectoral and interregional linkages as well price effects seem to be important transmission channels in the context of <b>systemic</b> <b>impact</b> of climate anomalies...|$|E

However, it is a non-trivial task to understand how a change at the protein structure level eventually affects a cell’s behavior. This is because complex information at both the protein and pathway level has to be integrated. Given that the idea of integrating both protein and pathway dynamics to estimate the <b>systemic</b> <b>impact</b> of missense mutations in proteins remains predominantly unexplored, we investigate the practicality of such an approach by formulating mathematical models and comparing them with experimental data to study missense mutations. We present two case studies: (1) interpreting systemic perturbation for mutations within the cell cycle control mechanisms (G 2 to mitosis transition) for yeast; (2) phenotypic classification of neuron-related human diseases associated with mutations within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We show that the application of simplified mathematical models is feasible for understanding the effects of small sequence changes on cellular behavior. Furthermore, we show that the <b>systemic</b> <b>impact</b> of missense mutations can be effectively quantified as a combination of protein stability change an...|$|E

Still contemporary innovation often consists in designing techniques with <b>systemic</b> <b>impact.</b> They are pervasive– both invasive and perturbing-, they recompose the family of techniques. Can we model the impact and the design of such techniques? More specifically: how can one design generic technology, ie a single technology that provokes a complete reordering of families of techniques? Recent advances in design theories open new possibilities to answer these questions. In this paper we use C-K design theory and a matroid-based model of the set of techniques to propose a new model (C-K/Ma) of the dynamics of techniques, accounting for the design of generic technologies. We show:  F 1 : C-K/Ma offers a computational model for designing a technique with <b>systemic</b> <b>impact.</b> This model sheds new light on the logics of combination in design – the model helps to identify four logics of " combinations ", from non-generative combinatorics to generative one...|$|E

40|$|Transitioning {{resource}} industries towards sustainability poses system-wide innovation challenges. This manuscript-style dissertation analyzes {{two cases}} of Canadian forest sector innovation, the Great Bear Rainforest Agreement (GBRA) and the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement (CBFA), using a sequential multi-paradigm theory-building approach (Lewis and Grimes, 1999). The research contributes new {{knowledge about the}} deliberate agency and cross-scale processes involved in advancing systemic social change, in particular the strategic action of civil society groups. Chapter 4 applies theoretical lenses from resilience (Gunderson and Holling, 2002) and social innovation (Westley and Antadze, 2010) to analyze the individual and collective agency (Bandura, 2006) in the Great Bear Rainforest. Six patterns of agency are found which demonstrate links between the micro-level processes of personal transformation, generative meso-level group interactions, and macro-level systemic transformation. Chapter 5 applies the multilevel perspective (MLP) from sociotechnical transitions (Geels, 2005; Geels and Schot, 2007) to analyze how global campaigns harnessed collective and proxy agency (Bandura, 2006) to generate mutually reinforcing dynamics (Grin, 2010) and advance sustainability transitions in the forest regimes studied. Chapter 6 presents a framework for evaluating <b>systemic</b> <b>impacts,</b> drawing from institutional innovation (Hargrave and Van de Ven, 2006; Zeitsma and Lawrence, 2010) and social innovation (Westley and Antadze, 2010). The outcomes of the GBRA and CBFA are compared, and the GBRA is found to have significantly greater <b>systemic</b> <b>impacts</b> than the CBFA. The conclusion presents an integrative model of the multi-level agency involved in systemic social change over time, with four patterns: 1) disruptive agency; 2) visionary-architectural system redesign; 3) relational and psycho-cultural change, and 4) mutually reinforcing distributed agency. The final pattern, mutually reinforcing agency, involves the ability to connect and orchestrate individual, collective and proxy agency across scales and over time as systemic changes are implemented. Together they suggest a more comprehensive theory for social change agency where the agency involved in transforming locked-in systems goes beyond system disruption and redesign, to include harnessing increasingly distributed forms proxy agency embedded in the global economy, supporting psycho-cultural transformations, and in cultivating mutually reinforcing agency across scales and over time...|$|R
