25|$|Stephen Baskerville {{states that}} <b>shared</b> <b>parenting</b> has been {{demonstrated}} to reduce parental conflict by requiring parents to cooperate and compromise, {{and that it is}} the lack of constraint by one parent resulting from the ability of that parent to exclude the other, that results in increased parental conflict. He further states that only when child support guidelines exceed true costs do parents ask for or seek to prevent changes in parenting time for financial reasons, adding that any argument that a parent is asking for increased parenting time to reduce child support {{is at the same time}} an argument that the other parent is making a profit from child support.|$|E

500|$|Increasingly, however, joint {{physical}} custody, in many U.S. states, is {{used with}} the presumption of equal <b>shared</b> <b>parenting,</b> however, in most states, it is still viewed as creating a necessity to provide each of the parents with [...] "significant periods" [...] of physical custody to ensure the children [...] "frequent and continuing contact" [...] with both parents.|$|E
500|$|In {{some states}} joint {{physical}} custody creates a presumption of equal <b>shared</b> <b>parenting,</b> however in most states, {{joint physical custody}} creates an obligation to provide each of the parents with [...] "significant periods" [...] of physical custody so as to assure the child of [...] "frequent and continuing contact" [...] with both parents. For example, states such as Alabama, California, and Texas do not necessarily require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time, whereas states such as Arizona, Georgia, and Louisiana do require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time where feasible. Courts generally have not clearly defined what [...] "significant periods" [...] and [...] "frequent and continuous contact" [...] mean, which requires parents to litigate to find out. In some states, however, courts have provided a clear definition, for instance, in Nevada, the Supreme Court has defined joint physical custody as an arrangement where each parent has at least 40% of the custodial time on a yearly basis.|$|E
2500|$|Members of the fathers' rights {{movement}} criticize {{the best interests}} of the child standard currently used in many countries for making custody decisions, which they describe as highly subjective and based on the personal prejudices of family court judges and court-appointed child custody evaluators, and that courts are abusive when more than half custody is taken away from a willing, competent parent. Members of the fathers' {{rights movement}} including Ned Holstein state that a rebuttable presumption of <b>shared</b> <b>parenting</b> is supported by a majority of citizens.

2500|$|A child's {{rights to}} a {{relationship}} with both their parents is increasingly recognized as an important factor for determining {{the best interests of}} the child in divorce and child custody proceedings.

2500|$|Stating that [...] "children {{need two}} parents" [...] and that [...] "children have a {{fundamental}} human {{right to an}} opportunity and relationship with both their mother and father", members of the fathers' rights movement call for greater equality in parental responsibility following separation and divorce. They call for laws creating a rebuttable presumption of 50/50 shared custody after divorce or separation, so that children would spend equal time with each parent unless there were reasons against it. They point to studies showing that children in shared custody settings are better adjusted and have fewer social problems such as low academic achievement, crime, pregnancy, substance abuse, depression and suicide, and state that <b>shared</b> <b>parenting</b> is in fact {{in the best interests}} of the child. Warren Farrell states that for children, equally <b>shared</b> <b>parenting</b> with three conditions (the child has about equal time with mom and dad, the parents live close enough to each other that the child does not need to forfeit friends or activities when visiting the other parent, and there is no bad-mouthing) is the second best family arrangement to the intact two-parent family, followed by primary father custody and then primary mother custody, and he adds that if <b>shared</b> <b>parenting</b> cannot be agreed upon, children on average are better off psychologically, socially, academically, and physically, have higher levels of empathy and assertiveness, and lower levels of ADHD, if their father is their primary custodial parent rather than their mother.|$|E

2500|$|After Keyes {{lost his}} battle for shared-custody of his {{children}} in 1984, he led a shared-parenting advocacy group in Nova Scotia. In 1998 he testified on <b>shared</b> <b>parenting</b> before Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access of the Government of Canada. [...] "I think that situation, where 60,000 children a year are forcibly denied any kind of equal parenting time with their fathers, {{is one of the}} worst state-enforced abuses of human rights in Canada today," [...] he told the committee. [...] "The court ordeals we go through are sickening and unbelievable. Abusive lawyers are rewarded by adversarial, winner-take-all courts. We have debtors' prison for fathers only. We have children moved away at the mother's whim. We have shattered families, devastated fathers, and scarred children. These are the dark ages of family law in Canada."

2500|$|At {{the time}} the Hague Abduction Convention was drafted {{domestic}} violence was never explicitly considered as an affirmative defense for child abduction, {{although it may be}} brought as a defense under Article 13, if [...] "there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation." [...] Article 13 supposed that the child's primary caretaker would abduct the child to escape the domestic violence of a non-custodial parent. At the time of the Conventions drafting, joint custody laws were rare. One parent was usually both the custodial parent and primary caretaker while the other, non-custodial parent had rights of access. The move towards joint custody laws conferred both the parent who acted as the primary caretaker and their ex-partner with custodial rights and, by extension, a right to request the return of children wrongfully removed from their place of habitual residence. In addition to not accounting for a shift in child custody law towards <b>shared</b> <b>parenting</b> and joint custody, according to Weiner, the framers of the Convention also did little to account for the motivation for abducting a child, generally assuming that all abductions were harmful to children; however, the child's primary caretaker may be fleeing with a child to protect himself or herself from a dangerous domestic situation.|$|E

Evidence in the AHEAD data that end-of-life transfers favor both current and expected caregivers, and that children make altruistic but resourceconstrained caregiving decisions, is consistent with a theory of estate division in which planned end-of-life transfers elicit care from altruistic children. ...|$|R
