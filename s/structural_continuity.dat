500|$|Assuming {{that not}} only humans but even some non-mammalian species are conscious, a number of {{evolutionary}} approaches {{to the problem of}} neural correlates of consciousness open up. For example, assuming that birds are conscious — a common assumption among neuroscientists and ethologists due to the extensive cognitive repertoire of birds — there are comparative neuroanatomical ways to validate some of the principal, currently competing, mammalian consciousness–brain theories. The rationale for such a comparative study is that the avian brain deviates structurally from the mammalian brain. So how similar are they? What homologues can be identified? The general conclusion from the study by Butler, et al., {{is that some of the}} major theories for the mammalian brain [...] also appear to be valid for the avian brain. The structures assumed to be critical for consciousness in mammalian brains have homologous counterparts in avian brains. Thus the main portions of the theories of Crick and Koch, Edelman and Tononi, and Cotterill [...] seem [...] to be compatible with the assumption that birds are conscious. Edelman also differentiates between what he calls primary consciousness (which is a trait shared by humans and non-human animals) and higher-order consciousness as it appears in humans alone along with human language capacity. Certain aspects of the three theories, however, seem less easy to apply to the hypothesis of avian consciousness. For instance, the suggestion by Crick and Koch that layer 5 neurons of the mammalian brain have a special role, seems difficult to apply to the avian brain, since the avian homologues have a different morphology. Likewise, the theory of Eccles seems incompatible, since a structural homologue/analogue to the dendron has not been found in avian brains. The assumption of an avian consciousness also brings the reptilian brain into focus. The reason is the <b>structural</b> <b>continuity</b> between avian and reptilian brains, meaning that the phylogenetic origin of consciousness may be earlier than suggested by many leading neuroscientists.|$|E

The assembly delivers entirely accurate constructional alignment overcoming any variations in fabrication tolerances and longitudinal and torsional <b>structural</b> <b>continuity</b> {{at the same}} time as allowing longitudinal expansion and contraction through environmental temperature ranges.

A permissible span of up to 33 metres under dynamic loading allows for optimising the spacing between columns for convenient ground positioning to avoid foundations clashing with sub-ground services. The design flexibility of irregular column spacing minimises visual impact and obtrusive collisions of the column footprint with existing urban features on the ground minimising the need for costly relocations whether it be a telephone box or an important data carrying fibre optic cable.|$|E
50|$|Aşıklı Höyük had a {{tradition}} to reconstruct or rebuild earlier structures. It followed a pattern where the structures were built “exactly {{on the same}} spot and with the same alignment as earlier buildings, using older walls as a foundation”. The <b>structural</b> <b>continuity</b> at Aşıklı Höyük is outstanding, {{but there is no}} information how long the use-life of a building was. If one estimates the same lifespan for a structure at Aşıklı Höyük as it was in Çatalhöyük, one could look at an age of 30 to 60 years before reconstruction occurred. If this assumption correct; the deep sounding 4H/G from phases 2I up to 2B (eight layers in total) show that the time span of a structure could be from 240 to 480 years. Looking outside of Central Anatolian Neolithic, this type of building continuity is unparalleled both in ethnography and archaeology. This remarkable <b>structural</b> <b>continuity</b> may suggest a social system in which buildings where not privately owned, since one would expect them to be modified on a regular basis. It can be assumed that the rooms were distributed amongst the community members according to the change in both needs and statuses.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to examine the {{idiosyncratic}} unfolding of Greek industrialisation and de-industrialisation from a long-run perspective (1867 - 1994). Following stylized facts, it is shown that the main shifts in the Greek economy occurred outside industry (from agriculture to services). Also, industrialization was a hesitant process evolving slowly and reaching a plateau in 1950 - 73. Three <b>structural</b> <b>continuities</b> that accompanied this progress have been a large state sector, the commercial character of Greek entrepreneurship and the incomplete transition from a mercantile/family to corporate capitalism.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is an ethnographic {{study of}} small business entrepreneurship and developing capitalism in the Russian Republic of Karelia. The entrepreneurial-minded individuals {{at the heart of}} my research began organizing labor and production in the mid 1990 's to create businesses that are now thriving within a spirit of capitalism that is emerging locally as a part of their efforts. Their energy and imagination unite Western-inspired ideas with Soviet-era <b>structural</b> <b>continuities</b> to accumulate capital at impressive rates. I examine the inner workings of their enterprises and the business networks within which they operate, focusing both on labor control and on how the entrepreneurs effectively socialize and retain workforces that can withstand the demands of a new market economy. This dissertation is based upon 15 months of field work in 2001 - 2002, which included months of participant-observation as a production worker in commercial cake and bread bakeries and also extended interactions with entrepreneurs and their managers. I use the language and concepts from the French Regulation School, which focuses on how regimes of capital accumulation operate and the regulating forces and institutions necessary to sustain them, to explore the relationship between <b>structural</b> <b>continuities</b> from the Soviet mode of regulating the economy and the emerging capitalist regime of accumulation. In this way, I focus on the underpinnings of capitalist circulation in Karelia—the ways in which individuals, institutions, and sectors are coordinating a process that at its essence seeks to reproduce social life through commodity production. I draw two fundamental conclusions from my research. First, Russia's shift to a capitalist system of accumulation, especially within the small business sector of the economy, has been less problematic than many scholars have understood or acknowledged. Second, anthropological investigations of capitalism must focus on the general logic of the underlying structures that control, promulgate and replicate the conditions necessary for capital to effectively accumulate, in addition to the unique characteristics associated with particular capitalist economies...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} print advertising from Cookie, an up-scale American parenting magazine for affluent mothers. The ads include seven designer clothing brands: Rocawear, Baby Phat, Ralph Lauren, Diesel, Kenneth Cole, Sean John, and DKNY. When considered {{within the context}} of their adult equivalents, the ads for the children’s lines often created a prolepsis—or flash-forward—by depicting the child model as a nascent adult. This was accomplished in three ways. First, the children’s ads typically contained <b>structural</b> <b>continuities</b> such as logo, set design, and color scheme that helped reinforce their relationship with the adult brand. Second, most of the ads place the camera at eye-level—a framing that allows the child models to address their adult viewers as equals. Finally, almost half of the ads feature at least one child looking directly at the camera with a serious expression. This is significant because, in Western culture, the withholding of a smile is a sign of dominance typically reserved for adult males. When children mimic this familiar and powerful “look,” they convey a sense of adult-like confidence and self-awareness often associated with precocious sexuality...|$|R

We discuss the impact of migration and activism on heretofore unquestioned equivalences between Germanness and whiteness and contemplate the triangulation of desire within the reception and appropriation of U. S. hip-hop by diverse groups of young people in Germany.   We argue that Afro-Americanophile subject positions diversified and that, especially since the 1980 s, some new dynamics have emerged that seem to leave behind ideas of racial ‘authenticity. ’  Finally, we query what a timeframe-based overview may not address so well, namely the question of <b>structural</b> <b>continuities</b> in the patterns of twentieth-century Afro-Americanophilia in Germany. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>continuity</b> was {{of great}} {{importance}} to the inhabitants of Aşıklı Höyük. The reason for this has partly been explained because they people had a rigid adherence to traditions in terms of structural reproduction. The “traditional view” has been resented due to that it is “short, labelling a society as conservative does not answer the question why the people under consideration were conservative”. As an alternative approach, refers to a historical dimension of the building to be of such great importance that “people came to be bound between walls, metaphorically domesticated (...)”. The interpretation that the walls are giving historical associations to the people living within them: giving a collective conscience lasting through time. The difference between this interpretation and the ‘conservative approach’ is the potential explanation to why structural reproduction could have been important for the inhabitants of Aşıklı Höyük. The identities of the inhabitants were projected to the structural outcome of the buildings. The generality of this position is not meaningful on its own. It is not certain that the inhabitants of Aşıklı Höyük {{were aware of the}} total amount of building there was in the sequence in total. Perhaps the history of a building did not concern them {{in the same way as}} archaeologists like to think.|$|E
50|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>continuity</b> between extracellular, cyst {{skeletal}} {{and nuclear}} components was discussed by Hay, Berezny et al. and Oschman. Historically, these elements have {{been referred to}} as ground substances, and because of their continuity, they act to form a complex, interlaced system that reaches into and contacts every part of the body. Even as early as 1851 it was recognized that the nerve and blood systems do not directly connect to the cell, but are mediated by and through an extracellular matrix. Recent research regarding the electrical charges of the various glycol-protein components of the extracellular matrix shows that because of the high density of negative charges on glycosaminoglycans (provided by sulfate and carboxylate groups of the uronic acid residues) the matrix is an extensive redox system capable of absorbing and donating electrons at any point. This electron transfer function reaches into the interiors of cells as the cytoplasmic matrix is also strongly negatively charged. The entire extracellular and cellular matrix functions as a biophysical storage system or accumulator for electrical charge. From thermodynamic, energetic and geometrical considerations, molecules of the ground substance are considered to form minimal physical and electrical surfaces, such that, based on the mathematics of minimal surfaces, minuscule changes can lead to significant changes in distant areas of the ground substance. This discovery is seen as having implications for many physiological and biochemical processes, including membrane transport, antigen-antibody interactions, protein synthesis, oxidation reactions, actin-myosin interactions, sol to gel transformations in polysaccharides.|$|E

40|$|We {{begin with}} many {{high-resolution}} photographs (with unconstrained lighting), compute an orientation field for each, and perform multi-view stereo matching using a metric based on orientation similarity. The resulting depth maps show high-resolution details of hair strands and we integrate {{them into a}} single merged model. In contrast, conventional multi-view stereo algorithms and merging techniques [4, 7] fail at capturing the fine hair structures. Reconstructing realistic 3 D hair geometry is challenging due to omnipresent occlusions, complex discontinuities and specular appearance. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-view hair reconstruction algorithm based on orientation fields with structure-aware aggregation. Our key insight is that while hair’s color appearance is viewdependent, the response to oriented filters that captures the local hair orientation is more stable. We apply the structure-aware aggregation to the MRF matching energy to enforce the <b>structural</b> <b>continuities</b> implied from the local hair orientations. Multiple depth maps from the MRF optimization are then fused into a globally consistent hair geometry with a template refinement procedure. Compared to the state-of-the-art color-based methods, our method faithfully reconstructs detailed hair structures. We demonstrate the results {{for a number of}} hair styles, ranging from straight to curly, and show that our framework is suitable for capturing hair in motion. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGrouping image tokens is an {{intermediate}} step needed {{to arrive at}} meaningful image representation and summarization. Usually, perceptual cues, for instance, gestalt properties inform token grouping. However, they do {{not take into account}} <b>structural</b> <b>continuities</b> that could be derived from other tokens belonging to similar structures irrespective of their location. We propose an image representation that encodes structural constraints emerging from local binary patterns (LBP), which provides a long-distance measure of similarity but in a structurally connected way. Our representation provides a grouping of pixels or larger image tokens that is free of numeric similarity measures and could therefore be extended to nonmetric spaces. The representation lends itself nicely to ubiquitous image processing applications such as connected component labeling and segmentation. We test our proposed representation on the perceptual grouping or segmentation task on the popular Berkeley segmentation dataset (BSD 500) that with respect to human segmented images achieves an average F-measure of 0. 559. Our algorithm achieves a high average recall of 0. 787 and is therefore well-suited to other applications such as object retrieval and category-independent object recognition. The proposed merging heuristic based on levels of singular tree component has shown promising results on the BSD 500 dataset and currently ranks 12 th among all benchmarked algorithms, but contrary to the others, it requires no data-driven training or specialized preprocessing...|$|R

The {{articles in}} this volume demonstrate how contemporary developments in work and mobility affect women migrants from developing countries. The 21 st century has been said to be one that will see the rise and dominance of Asia. To fuel this systemic economic take off implies an increase in human flows within and to this region to respond to demographic and economic differentials across the region. Against this backdrop, this volume discusses the role that women in migration play as foreign wives, domestic workers and seasonal rural to urban migrants. It maps {{some of the issues that}} they confront in destination countries, as well as in their own homes as absent wives, mothers and daughters in expanded networks of global householding. On another level, this volume frames the overseas employment and settlement of women migrants in destination countries, in the contexts of contestations between States, organized labor exporters and emergent migrant women's movements, which for migrant women represent their individual and collective strategies for making a 'bare life" (Agamben, 1998 : 177, 180) liveable.

The first measure of change concerns <b>structural</b> stability: <b>continuity</b> in the organisation {{of a set}} of variables across time.

In this model, it is the interaction between ageing effects or socio-cultural factors (period and cohort effects) and another variable that is assessed. These three approaches of change are illustrated on the basis of beliefs about the self, life and society assessed in representative populations of elders in two regions of Switzerland (Geneva and Central Valais) in 1979 ({N} = 1608) and 1994 ({N} = 2101) ...|$|R

The aims of the Decade of Change (DCS) project were to extend and deepen conceptual, empirical and methodological understanding of individual and household plans and strategies, by re-interviewing a group of individuals and their partners interviewed in Kirkcaldy in 1986 - 1987 {{as part of the}} Social Change and Economic Life Initiative (SCELI). The SCELI data are held at the Archive under SN: 2798. More specifically, the objectives of the project were to: examine how plans and strategies evolve over time, by comparing the late 1980 s responses with those given ten years later, and by exploring with respondents their accounts of why these changes have occurred; seek to relate the changing patterns of plans and strategies to some of the <b>structural</b> <b>continuities</b> in the wider and local economy and society over the past ten years, by comparing the responses given by respondents aged 30 - 45 years and 46 - 60 ten years ago, with those aged 30 - 45 and 46 - 60 now, and by discussing with respondents their perceptions of the consequences for their households of these changes; explore, further than in the original study, {{the extent to which it}} is meaningful to retain a concept of 'household' strategies as opposed to 'his' and 'her' strategies; investigate these issues by re-interviewing, using survey methodology, as many of the original Kirkcaldy 'household sample' interviewed in the SCELI as can be traced and are willing to be interviewed, and by carrying out semi-structured intensive interviews with 60 couples divided between those now aged 30 - 45, 46 - 60 and 61 - 70, including those couples traced who were previously interviewed in this way; examine further the relationship between a survey and a more qualitative approach to these issues; attempt to throw some light on the reliability of retrospective questions in this kind of study.

Best/Worst Events in Life (Feelings/(in) security); G. Networks and Social Support; H. Resources; J. Ambitions and Plans. In most sections, data were collected from both original respondents to the SCELI Household Survey (ORs) and their present partners (Ps) wherever possible. Some questions were asked of the ORs only and some were joint responses. Where separate responses from the ORs and their partners are available, they are coded as br [...] . or bp [...] . respectively; otherwise they are coded as br [...] .

40|$|Event synopsis: Skeptical {{reactions}} {{to the rise of}} memory studies have focused on the viability of concepts such as “collective” memory. Can societies really remember collectively? More to the point, can individuals really remember what they have not directly witnessed or experienced? Is to speak of collective memory simply to speak of ideology or political fantasy? The concept of cultural memory has overcome this binary opposition between the individual and the collective, attending to their reciprocal relationship and the cultural grounds on which their mediation takes place (Assman). How, though, does memory work when events are remembered across and between cultures? In an age of globalization, is it still possible to speak of local and national memory, or do the local and national always exist in implicit and explicit dialogue with the transnational? Holocaust- and memory studies have begun to address these questions in tracing the globalization of Holocaust memory as a trope by which other modern atrocities are shaped and remembered, and, of course, the Holocaust has been incorporated into national memories in order to forget indigenous genocides and shore up ideals of nation (Huyssen and Patraka). Conversely, theories of vicarious witnessing have posited an ethical dimension to the remembrance of events across cultural boundaries. The ideas of “prosthetic” and “post” memory conceive of the remembrance of events not witnessed by those born afterwards or elsewhere, and of mass- mediated memory as something that does not wholly belong to (and define) the familial, ethnic or national group (Hirsch and Landsberg). (The idea of witnessing across cultural borders has not been without controversy in the academy.) Recent innovations in comparative historiography (Moses, Stone, Moshman), laying vital groundwork for developments in memory studies, have sought to remove the “conceptual blockages” in comparing modern atrocities, moving beyond notions of the Holocaust’s uniqueness that might inscribe a hierarchy of suffering across modernity, eliciting the <b>structural</b> <b>continuities</b> and discontinuities between atrocious events – between genocide and colonialism. Just as Moses has configured modernity in terms of a racial century, so in sociology and literary studies race has constituted an overarching narrative that brings together diverse modern spheres of both culturally creative and violent activity and identification (Cheyette and Gilroy). In postcolonial studies, concepts such as trauma have enabled a spatial rather than linear approach to the experiences of colony and postcolony (Durrant). In philosophy, conceptions of ‘bare life’ have allowed an international consideration of state sovereignties and their biopolitical regimes (Agamben). In architectural and urban studies, city development and its architecture is found to articulate a globalised vernacular, which has implications for spaces and places of memory and memorialisation. All of these disciplines find that it is increasingly difficult and problematic to isolate representations of past, which in turn calls attention to the need for the comparative study of memory as it takes an increasingly transcultural form – as Rothberg’s recent ground-breaking work on the multi-directionality of memory has shown. The conference organizers invite abstracts on the subject of transcultural memory from across the disciplines – English and Comparative Literary Studies, History, Cultural Studies, Architectural Studies, Cultural Geography, Film Studies, Media Studies, Politics, Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, the Visual Arts, and so on – but recognize that the study of memory will often involve an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach...|$|R
40|$|New dinosaur tracks {{have been}} found near Bisceglie (Bari, Apulia), on loose blocks {{ascribed}} to the Corato Member (late Bedoulian to early Gargasian) of the Calcare di Bari Fm. The material consists of isolated footprints {{as well as of}} short trackways of quadrupedal and bipedal dinosaurs. The new tracksite has yielded a quite differentiated dinosaur ichnocoenosis, including theropod, sauropod, thyreophoran and ornithopod footprints. The discovery of early Aptian dinosaur footprints in the limestone of the carbonate platform of southern Italy gives new insights on dinosaur distribution, and new palaeontological constraints for the palaeogeographic reconstruction of the Mediterranean Tethys during the Cretaceous. The analysis of this and others ichnosites of the periadriatic carbonate platforms, gives evidence of repeated emersions and of widespread land-vertebrates dwelling. The characteristics of the associations suggest that the trackmakers did not constitute a real coevolved association but the occasional co-occurrence of taxa after migration. The results emphasize the need of both <b>structural</b> and environmental <b>continuity</b> and walking ways between a southern continent and the periadriatic carbonate platforms during the Early Cretaceous. © 2008 Elsevier B.
