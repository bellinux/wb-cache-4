40|$|Speech-training systems {{providing}} {{visual feedback}} of vocal tract shape {{are found to}} be useful for improving vowel articulation. Estimation of vocal tract shape, based on LPC and other analysis techniques, generally fails during stop closures, due to very low signal energy and unavailability of spectral information. Based on estimated area values and line spectrum pair (LSP) coefficients before and after stop closure in vowel-consonant-vowel (VCV) syllables, least-squares bivariate conic and cubic polynomial surfaces were generated and used for shape estimation during stop closure by performing 2 D interpolation. Implementation of the technique with automated processing of /aCa / syllables successfully estimated the place of articulation during closure segments of velar, alveolar, and bilabial stops. The technique can be used to provide visual feedback to improve production of stop consonants.

40|$|The {{display of}} intensity, pitch, and vocal tract shape is {{considered}} to be helpful in <b>speech</b> <b>training</b> of the hearing impaired. Vocal tract shape estimation, based on LPC and other analysis techniques, works satisfactorily for vowels but generally fails during stop consonants due to very low signal energy. Our estimation of vocal tract shape is based on reflection coefficients obtained from LPC analysis of speech. In order to study the consistency and dynamics of the vocal tract shape estimation with amplitude variation of vowels, and to study the transitions at vowel-consonant boundaries, we have used “areagram”, a spectrogram-like two-dimensional display of estimated vocal tract cross-sectional area as a function of time and position along the tract length. Display of areagram for vowel-consonant-vowel (V-C-V) syllables is satisfactory for vowel part, but during stop closure, area values become random. Based on estimated vocal tract cross sectional area before and after stop closure, conic surfaces are obtained and used for estimation of vocal tract shape during stop closure by a two-dimensional interpolation.

40|$|AbstractAccurate {{depiction}} of the vocal tract shape is essential for development of <b>speech</b> <b>training</b> <b>aids</b> for hearing impaired. Speech therapists have concluded from their research that if speech disorders are detected {{at an early stage}} then the rectification of those becomes faster and to a great accuracy. In case of adults, the vocal tract shape estimation can be performed by using techniques like X-Ray, MRI or using articulatory analysis by synthesis. Due to certain difficulties present in the methods mentioned like radiation effect and loud sound impulses produced by rapid switching of magnetic field are not considered suitable for children. Thus there is lack of availability of vocal tract shape data for children due to inability to use direct estimation methods for children. So it becomes necessary to carry out comparative study of vocal tract shape estimation techniques of children using indirect vocal tract shape estimation techniques. This paper aims to make available a considerable amount of data to researchers for study towards children's vocal tract shape using implemented techniques. The final objective of research work is to perform a detailed study on techniques available for vocal tract shape estimation, to implement and further compare the covariance and lattice methods for children using MATLAB software. Currently, the vocal tract shape estimation based on autocorrelation method is implemented and the results obtained are presented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a CBST system called OLT (Optical Logo-Therapy). OLT provides visual {{feedback to the}} subject by representing an utterance as a trajectory on a 2 D 'phonetic map'. The map is created by Sammon mapping, a technique which defines, for a given set of N-D vectors, a non-linear projection into a 2 -D space. The data set for which a Sammon map is created is obtained by Kohonen's learning vector quantisation from a training set of utterances from normal speakers. The path plotted on the Sammon map for a new utterance provides a qualitative comparison against a standard of speech performance. OLT also contains tools to make quantitative comparison and display the results. OLT can be specialised to deal with particular speech training problems. Here results are presented for an experiment based on the pronunciation of the sibilant fricatives /ò, s, z and zh/. Comparisons are given between a subject with difficulty in articulating these sounds and normal speakers. 1. COMPUTER BASED <b>SPEECH</b> <b>TRAINING</b> <b>AID...</b>|$|E

This article reports {{a case study of}} a patient with dysarthric speech due to Parkinson's disease (PD) who enrolled in a 4 -week intensive <b>speech</b> <b>training</b> through EST. The primary goal was to investigate the feasibility and the potential efficacy of EST as a Web {{application for}} <b>speech</b> <b>training</b> in dysarthric patients with PD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The participant used EST, following a <b>speech</b> <b>training</b> program containing parts of the pitch limiting voice treatment for patients with PD. The feasibility of EST for independent <b>speech</b> <b>training</b> in the home environment was verified through a questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed the participant's individual experiences with EST as well as the extent of satisfaction with technological features of EST, the content of the <b>speech</b> <b>training,</b> and the suitability of the home training environment. The potential efficacy of EST as a device to improve speech intelligibility was investigated using a repeated measures with randomized blocks design. The proportion of correct orthographic transcriptions of semantically unpredictable sentences as well as ratings of perceived intelligibility on a 10 -point scale were used as measures for speech intelligibility. RESULTS: Outcomes of the questionnaire resulted in recommendations to enhance EST feasibility. Speech intelligibility, as measured by transcription scores, improved significantly after EST training. This improvement was maintained for 2 weeks after completing the EST training, whereas considerably lower scores were observed after 11 weeks without training. Subjective ratings of intelligibility did not show significant differences across time. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this case study confirm the potential of EST for patients with PD...|$|R

The main {{purpose of this study}} was to develop and assess an on-land <b>training</b> <b>aid</b> for learning balance in sprint kayaking. The literature has shown the importance of biomechanical analysis and how <b>training</b> <b>aids</b> can provide a beneficial part in the learning process of new skills. An on-water experimental analysis was conducted on experienced paddlers to establish the kinematic characteristics and the centre of rotation position of the kayak-paddler system. From this analysis it was found that the kayak rolling motion is dependent on the paddler’s ability and the centre of rotation of the kayak paddler system relative to the seat of the kayak was found to be between 10 cm – 13 cm above the seat. Findings from this analysis were interpreted into technical requirements and integrated into the design of the <b>training</b> <b>aid.</b> Once built the <b>training</b> <b>aid</b> prototype was evaluated by a series of testing and modification to enhance its ability to replicate the on-water kayak. The evaluation data showed that the stationary sprint kayak on-water medial-lateral rolling motion is affected by weight variations and further evaluation demonstrated that the <b>training</b> <b>aid</b> has the ability to replicate the motion for different weights.
