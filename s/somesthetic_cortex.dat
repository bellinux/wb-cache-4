5000|$|The lateral corticospinal tract is {{responsible}} for the motor pathway of the pronator quadratus. This tract begins in the precentral gyrus of the motor cortex where a signal is transmitted from the upper motor nerve through the progression tracts of the internal capsule and through the cerebral peduncles of the midbrain. It decussates in the medulla and travels down the lateral corticospinal tract in the lateral column of the spinal cord. It then decussates in the spinal cord and synapses at the anterior horn to the lower motor neurons of the skeletal muscles.The cuneate fasciculus tract {{is responsible}} for the sensation of the pronator quadratus position and movement, deep touch, visceral pain, and vibration. This tract begins in the dorsal nerve root where the signal is transmitted through the dorsal horn and up the posterior column of the spinal cord. It synapses with an interneuron in the gracile nucleus. It then decussates in the medial lemniscus of the medulla, travels through the cuneate nucleus and through the medial lemniscus of the midbrain to synapse in the thalamus. It synapses with a third order neuron and transmits the signal to the postcentral gyrus of the <b>somesthetic</b> <b>cortex.</b>|$|E

The hypothesis that somatosensory and visual maps in the respective primary cortical projection areas are of the same analytical structure is argued. New experimental data documented in subhuman primates demonstrate that neural responses to cutaneous stimuli depend on situational factors and on behavior-controlling instructions conveyed over another sense modality and that as a result the redundancy of cutaneous stimulus encoding in the <b>somesthetic</b> <b>cortex</b> is reduced...|$|E
40|$|In ten {{adult cats}} anesthetized with {{ketamine}} hydrochloride the neocortex was exposed and rectangular pulses (1 msec, 0. 5 Hz and variable intensity) {{were applied to}} discrete points of one side and transcallosal evoked potentials were recorded from the other. The stimulation and recording positions were determined on a cartesian map {{of most of the}} exposable neocortical areas and the potentials were analysed as to their components, voltage and latency. Passive spread and electrotonic potentials and the effects of increasing frequency were also analysed. The results showed large transcallosal potentials in some areas and an increase of potentials in the caudorostral direction, attaining the highest values in anteromedial areas of the suprasylvian gyrus. Confirming anatomical studies, a few silent spots were found in the motor and <b>somesthetic</b> <b>cortex</b> and in restricted posterior regions of the visual cortex, where small or zero voltages occurred. While causing weak contralateral potentials, stimulation of some posterior sites provoked high voltage potentials in anterior regions of the side being stimulated and in the corresponding area of the opposite site. These posterior sites are. poorly interconnected by the corpus callosum. The L-shaped indirect connection described in this work may be involved in some types of epilepsy and may explain the effectiveness of partial callosotomy in their treatment...|$|E

A propriocepção estava acentuadamente comprometida nos artelhos que abrigavam a câimbra. Seu relato se adequava ao padrão das distonias fixas, não transcrita, todavia, como deformidade motora visível, razão pela qual designamos o fenômeno de "distonia virtual". A RNM mostrou imagem de infarto do núcleo lateral {{posterior}} do tálamo (VPL) e degeneração walleríana de projeções VPL-corticais. O SPECT, exclusão do tálamo e hipoperfusão do córtex parietal dorsal ipsilateral e dos núcleos da base bilateralmente. Sugerimos que, em decorrência da interrupção de aferentes propríoceptivos no tálamo, o córtex somestésico (S-I) originou atividade topograficamente ordenada, que emergiu sob a forma de distonia como representação mental subjetiva. Sugerimos que a distonia virtual represente o análogo somestésico das alucinoses unimodais, cujo exemplo mais conhecido é a síndrome de Bonnet. Behaviors, {{actions and}} movements may take place as purely mental events, {{as in the}} obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder, phantom limbs or sensory tics. In the present paper {{we report on the}} case of a 43 -year-old diabetic hypertensive man who developed an incomplete form of the Dejerine-Roussy syndrome. Whenever he lay down or withdrew the leg from the ground, he experienced the illusion that the left intermediate toes painfully twisted and mounted each other. Conversely, as he stood up or firm pressure was artificially exerted against the sole, there was a dramatic relief from the "cramp" whose illusory character could he be certain of only by looking down at the foot. By passively moving his toes into the referred position we realized that the experienced deformity conformed to the pattern of a fixed dystonia not outwardly expressed through the motor system. There was severe proprioceptive loss in the same toes that harbored the cramp. MRI showed the appropriate lesion in the posteroventrolateral thalamus (VPL) and wallerian degeneration of thalamo-cortical projections. SPECT showed hypoperfusion of the overlying ipsilateral parietal cortex {{as well as of the}} basal nuclei bilaterally, besides the expected image of thalamic exclusion. We hypothesize that the infarct disconnected the somatic sensory cortex (S-I) from critical proprioceptive input with relative sparing of superficial sensibility. Lifting the foot deprived S-I of tonic inputs conveyed by undamaged contact-pressure pathways, a functional effect promptly reversed by placing the foot back against the ground. The case illustrates how a capricious deafferentation of S-I by a discrete VPL thalamic infarct might facilitate the emergence of autochthonous activity in the primary <b>somesthetic</b> <b>cortex</b> and give rise to a purely mental abnormal involuntary movement akin to the unimodal hallucinoses of which the syndrome of Bonnet is the best-known example. Virtual abnormal involuntary movements may be concealed more often than appreciated by complaints such as pains or cramps in patients with nervous system lesions...|$|E
