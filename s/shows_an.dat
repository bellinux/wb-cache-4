5|$|Evolution {{also does}} not require that organisms become more complex. Although the history of life <b>shows</b> <b>an</b> {{apparent}} trend towards the evolution of biological complexity; {{there is a question}} if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or if it comes from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes. In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but that specific circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus naturally selected for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.|$|E

5|$|In Buah Rindu, Amir <b>shows</b> <b>an</b> {{affinity}} for using traditional Malay poetic forms {{such as the}} quatrain, but unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, he mixes the rhyming patterns. The text is dominated by terms related to love and searching, and according to Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw the collection is united by a theme of longing. Johns states that the imagery in Buah Rindu is dependent on traditional Malay literature, and that Amir's terminology is heavily influenced by classical Malay poetry. The author's use of language is also notably coloured by Javanese terms and ideas, and another source of influence appears to be Indian literature, with references to Hindu gods and goddesses.|$|E

The caesura may not always be in the centre of a line; it is at times towards the front, and at times towards the rear.|$|E
