50|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} to use a superconducting resonator network Boson <b>Sampling</b> <b>device</b> as an interferometer.

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{exploration of}} Mars {{will require the}} collection and return of subterranean samples to Earth for examination. This necessitates the use of some type of device or devices that possesses the ability to effectively penetrate the Martian surface, collect suitable samples and return them to the surface {{in a manner consistent}} with imposed scientific constraints. The first opportunity for such a device will occur on the 2003 and 2005 Mars Sample Return missions, being performed by NASA. This paper reviews the work completed on the compilation of a database containing viable penetrating and <b>sampling</b> <b>devices,</b> the performance of a system level trade study comparing selected devices to a set of prescribed parameters and the employment of a metric for the evaluation and ranking of the traded penetration and <b>sampling</b> <b>devices,</b> with respect to possible usage on the 03 and 05 sample return missions. The trade study performed is based on a select set of scientific, engineering, programmatic and socio-political criterion.

5000|$|Chemcatcher® is {{a highly}} {{versatile}} and cost-effective passive <b>sampling</b> <b>device</b> for monitoring {{a wide variety of}} pollutants in water. Most monitoring programmes involve the periodic collection of low volume spot samples (bottle or grab) of water, which is challenging, particularly where levels fluctuate over time and when chemicals are only present at trace, yet toxicologically relevant concentrations. The Chemcatcher® passive <b>sampling</b> <b>device</b> is currently being used throughout the world to measure time-weighted average (TWA) or equilibrium concentrations {{of a wide range of}} pollutants in water. This allows the end user to obtain a more representative picture of the chemicals that may be present in the aquatic environment. The Chemcatcher® concept was developed by Professors Richard Greenwood and Graham Mills at the University of Portsmouth, together with colleagues from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. The device is patented [...] in a number of countries and the name is a registered trademark in the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of small}} diffusion-sink <b>sampling</b> <b>devices</b> allows the {{relatively}} noninvasive and unobtrusive collection of a specimen that represents, in a precisely interpretable way, the average freely diffusing concentration of an analyte over a biologically relevant period of time. In an orally worn configuration, these <b>sampling</b> <b>devices</b> reject artifacts arising from blood plasma contamination of saliva {{and provide a}} time-averaged sample without requiring the subject to adhere to a frequent-sampling schedule. The practical advantages of noninvasiveness are thus com-bined with a fairly direct method for measuring what seems, in light of our current understanding, most impor-tant {{to know about the}} relative abundance of the steroid hormones.

40|$|Traditional {{comparisons}} between the capture efficiency of <b>sampling</b> <b>devices</b> have generally looked at the absolute differences between devices. We recommend that the signal-to-noise ratio be used when comparing the capture efficiency of benthic <b>sampling</b> <b>devices.</b> Using the signal-to-noise ratio rather than the absolute difference has the advantages that the variance is taken into account when determining how important the difference is, the hypothesis and minimum detectable difference can be made identical for all taxa, it is independent of the units used for measurement, and the sample-size calculation is independent of the variance. This new technique is illustrated by comparing the capture efficiency of a 0. 05 m van Veen grab and an airlift suction <b>device,</b> using <b>samples</b> taken from Heron and One Tree lagoons, Australia...|$|R
