50|$|A {{satellite}} telephone, satellite phone, or <b>satphone</b> {{is a type}} {{of mobile}} phone that connects to orbiting satellites instead of terrestrial cell sites. They provide similar functionality to terrestrial mobile telephones; voice, short messaging service and low-bandwidth internet access are supported through most systems.|$|E
40|$|General purpose {{communication}} {{systems such as}} GSM and UMTS {{have been in the}} focus of security re-searchers for over a decade now. Recently also technologies that are only used under more specific circum-stances have come into the spotlight of academic research and the hacker scene alike. A striking example of this is recent work [Driessen et al. 2012] that analyzed the security of the over-the-air encryption in the two existing ETSI <b>satphone</b> standards GMR- 1 and GMR- 2. The firmware of handheld devices was reverse-engineered and the previously unknown stream ciphers A 5 -GMR- 1 and A 5 -GMR- 2 were recovered. In a second step, both ciphers were cryptanalized, resulting in a ciphertext-only attack on A 5 -GMR- 1 and a known-plaintext attack on A 5 -GMR- 2. In this work, we extend the afore-mentioned results in the following ways: First, we improve the proposed attack on A 5 -GMR- 1 and reduce its average case complexity from 232 to 221 steps. Second, we implement a practical attack to successfully record communications in the Thuraya network and show that it can be done with moderate effort for approx. $ 5 000. We describe the implementation of our modified attack and the crucial aspects to make it practical. Using our eavesdropping setup, we recorded 30 seconds of our own satellite-to-satphone communication and show that we are able to recover Thuraya session keys in half an hour (on average). We supplement these results with experiments designed to highlight the feasibility o...|$|E
50|$|Repeaters are {{available}} for all the different GSM frequency bands. Some repeaters will handle different types of networks, such as multi-mode GSM and UMTS, repeaters however dual- and tri-band systems cost significantly more. Repeater systems {{are available}} for certain Satellite phone systems, allowing the <b>satphones</b> to be used indoors without a clear line of sight to the satellite.|$|R
50|$|The mobile equipment, {{also known}} as a terminal, varies widely. Early {{satellite}} phone handsets had a size and weight comparable to that of a late-1980s or early-1990s mobile phone, but usually with a large retractable antenna. More recent satellite phones are similar in size to a regular mobile phone while some prototype satellite phones have no distinguishable difference from an ordinary smartphone. <b>Satphones</b> are popular on expeditions into remote areas where terrestrial cellular service is unavailable.|$|R
50|$|Air Evac {{owns and}} {{operates}} around 140 Bell 206 L1+ Long Ranger helicopters and about a dozen Bell 407 helicopters which are equipped with: Allison Rolls-Royce C30 engine, Garmin 396 GPS with XM Weather overlay, Garmin 430W GPS VHF, Becker Mode S Transponder, SkyTrac® satellite tracking, <b>SatPhones,</b> TDFM-7000 3 Band radios, Intellistart®, ANVIS-9 Night Vision Goggles, and Air Evac's proprietary litter system. The company has flown the Bell 206 LongRanger {{since its founding in}} 1985 because of its reliability, efficiency, agility and excellent safety record. While these aircraft are widely used and regarded as safe aircraft, in comparison to other airframes used, they are cramped for space which can sometimes make patient care difficult.|$|R
