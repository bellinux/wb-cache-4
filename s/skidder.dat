Nokian Heavy Tyres Ltd is {{a manufacturer of}} special tyres for forestry, industrial machinery, and agriculture. Its products are sold as original equipment as well on the replacement tyre market. Nokian Tyres produces a number of product lines, including the Tractor Industrial 2 and Country King. Nokian Tyres is a world market leader in forestry tyres, which are a key product of the Nokian Heavy Tyres subsidiary. Nokian forestry tyres include the <b>Skidder</b> and Cut-To-Length model lines. The <b>Skidder</b> tyres have a 25 degree bar angle and the Cut-To-Length tyres have a 35 degree bar angle. Bar angle is a tyre tread measurement. Smaller bar angles are associated with higher traction {{at the expense of}} increased mud accumulation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- Utilization rate is an {{important}} factor in calculating machine rates for forest harvesting machines. Machine rates allow an evaluation of harvesting system costs and facilitate comparisons between different systems and machines. There are many factors that affect utilization rate. These include mechanical delays, non-mechanical delays, operational lost time, and personnel time. As a result utilization rate can be highly variable and difficult to accurately estimate without detailed information. This paper reports on an ongoing study to measure the utilization rates for forest harvesting machines in the southern US, specifically rubber tired grapple <b>skidders.</b> Electronic service recorders were mounted on four grapple <b>skidders</b> on a harvesting operation in east central Alabama. To date, 44 working days have been monitored for three of the <b>skidders</b> and 19 for the fourth machine. The average utilization rate ranged from 76. 5 percent to 64. 8 percent...|$|R

50|$|On a cable <b>skidder,</b> {{the cable}} is reeled out and {{attached}} to a pull of cut timber, then the winch pulls the load toward the <b>skidder.</b> The winch or grapple holds the trees while the <b>skidder</b> drags them to a landing area. Cable skidders are less popular than in the past. They are more labor intensive than grapple skidders because someone (the operator or a second person) must drag the winch line out to the logs and hook them up.

5000|$|The early {{mechanical}} skidders were steam powered. They {{traveled on}} railroads, known as [...] "dummylines" [...] and the felled trees were dragged or [...] "skidded" [...] to the railroad {{where they were}} later loaded onto rail cars. Some were just steam donkeys, others were more complicated. One popular brand was the Clyde <b>Skidder,</b> built by Clyde Ironworks in Duluth, Minnesota. The Clyde <b>skidder</b> illustrated was photographed at the Marathon Lumber Company logging operations near Newton, Mississippi in the early 1920s. Although these machines appear to be large and cumbersome, they were true workhorses of their day. The Clyde was capable of retrieving logs from four different points at the same time. Each cable, or lead, was approximately 1000 feet in length. Once the logs were attached and a clearance signal was sent for retrieval, they could be skidded at a speed of 1000 feet per minute. Working conditions around these machines were very dangerous. The largest of these was the Lidgerwood <b>skidder,</b> which not only brought logs to the landing from the cutting site, but loaded them onto railroad cars as well, making it both a <b>skidder</b> & loader. In New Zealand cables were run five miles.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the ergonomic performance of 13 harvesting machine models was assessed from an ergonomic viewpoint. The main objective {{of the study was}} to compare ergonomic performance to harvesting machine operators’ work and propose viable solutions to improve the work environment. The principal assessed ergonomic requirements were operators’ workspace, operators’ seats, visibility, work postures, whole-body vibration and noise in the cab, all as related to the tasks involved in typical harvesting cycles. Altogether, more than 120 different parameters that impact ergonomics and work conditions were measured directly at workplaces in the actual working conditions. The results were then compared to the effective norms and the degree of compliance with the stipulated values was determined. The obtained estimates for the degree of compliance were integrated. This permits a direct {{comparison of}} the work-load on operators with a single integrated indicator (severity). In many respects the ergonomic standard is now good, except for <b>skidders.</b> Visibility and work postures were considered to be the most critical features influencing the operator’s performance. Even in highly mechanized harvesting work, problems still exist despite extensive development of cabs. The best working conditions in terms of harvesting systems were provided by »harvester + forwarder« in cut-to-length harvesting and »feller buncher + grapple skidder« in full-tree harvesting. The traditional Russian tree-length harvesting done with cable <b>skidders</b> showed the worst results in terms of ergonomics. When a partially mechanized harvesting system is employed, use of cable <b>skidders</b> should be as limited as possible, because, as a whole, they do not comply with the present ergonomic requirements...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} types of 'fixed boom' grapple <b>skidders.</b> A single-function boom type has two {{hydraulic}} cylinders, only allowing the boom to lower in one position. Dual-function booms (as pictured) have four cylinders, which allows for adjusting the boom in two different places. The third type permits the grapple boom to be swung from side to side, allowing spread out trees to be grabbed at once.|$|R
