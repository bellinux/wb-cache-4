50|$|Rubber {{products}} are often safety-critical parts of machines, so that failure can often cause accidents {{or loss of}} function. Failed products can be examined {{with many of the}} generic polymer methods, although it is more difficult if the sample is vulcanized or cross-linked. Attenuated total reflectance infra-red spectroscopy is useful because the product is usually flexible so can be pressed against the selenium crystal used for analysis. Simple swelling tests can also help to identify the specific elastomer used in a product. Often the best technique is ESEM using the X-ray elemental analysis facility on the microscope. Although the method only provides elemental analysis, it can provide clues as to the identity of the elastomer being examined. Thus the presence of substantial amounts of chlorine indicates polychloroprene while the presence of nitrogen indicates nitrile rubber. The method is also useful in confirming ozone cracking by the large amounts of oxygen present on cracked <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Ozone</b> attacks susceptible elastomers such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber and polybutadiene and associated copolymers.

40|$|As an {{important}} solar-radiation absorbing aerosol, {{the effect of}} black carbon (BC) on <b>surface</b> <b>ozone,</b> by influencing photolysis rate, has been widely discussed by offline model studies. However, BC-boundary layer (BL) interactions also influence <b>surface</b> <b>ozone.</b> Using the online model simulations and processes analysis, we demonstrate the significant impact of BC-BL interaction on <b>surface</b> <b>ozone.</b> The absorbing effect of BC heats the air above the BL and suppresses BL development, which eventually leads {{to changes in the}} contributions of ozone through chemical and physical processes (photochemistry, vertical mixing, and advection). Different from previous offline model studies, BL suppression leads large amounts of ozone precursors being confined below the BL which offsetting the influence from the reduction of photolysis rate, thus enhancing ozone photochemical formation before noon. Furthermore, the changes in physical process show a more significant influence on <b>surface</b> <b>ozone.</b> The weakened turbulence entrains much less ozone from the overlying ozone-rich air down to surface. As a result, the net contribution of ozone from physical and chemical processes leads to <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> reduction before noon. The maximum reduction reaches to 16. 4  ppb at 12 : 00. In the afternoon, the changes in chemical process are small which influence inconspicuously to <b>surface</b> <b>ozone.</b> However, physical process still influences the <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> significantly. Due to the delayed development of the BL, less vertically mixed BL continues to show an obvious ozone gradient {{near the top of the}} BL. Therefore, more ozone aloft can be entrained down to the surface, offsetting the <b>surface</b> <b>ozone</b> reduction. Comparing all the changes in the contributions of processes, the change in the contribution of vertical mixing plays a more important role in impacting <b>surface</b> <b>ozone.</b> Our results show the great impacts of BC-BL interactions on <b>surface</b> <b>ozone.</b> And more attention should be paid on the mechanism of aerosol-BL interactions when we deal with the ozone pollution control in China...|$|E
