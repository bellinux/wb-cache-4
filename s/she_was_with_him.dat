25|$|After a {{few months}} of being together, happy and in love, Robin has a {{pregnancy}} scare. Although the test is negative, she realizes she wants different things from life than Patrick. She wants more from him (children), while he is happy just the way they are. They eventually break up. Robin wants to be a mother and decides to be a single mom. She and her friend, Dr. Kelly Lee (Minae Noji), put a list of possible sperm donors together. Robin picks people in Port Charles, because she feels that they have redeeming qualities she will like to pass on to her child, and does not like the idea of her child's father being a stranger. On November 30, 2007, Patrick tells Robin that he still loves and misses her. He just wants them to be together again and asks her to table the discussion of children for a year, and while she has stated that she has never been happier than when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> she knows nothing would be different in a year - she would still want kids and he would not, to which he sadly replies that she is probably right, {{but it would have been}} a great year.|$|E

Vivian takes Robbie for sex in his cabin, which is accidentally interrupted by Lisa, who told Baby {{that she was}} intending {{to have sex with}} Robbie.

Later in the morning over breakfast, Max and Neil Kellerman reveal to the Housemans that Moe Pressman's wallet was stolen while he was playing a card game with other guests. Vivian accuses Johnny of the theft in a fit of her jealousy over Johnny's rejection. Johnny is unable to provide a verifiable alibi, in order to protect his relationship with Baby. To save Johnny from being fired, Baby confesses that Johnny did not commit the theft because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> in his cabin that night. Johnny is cleared of the theft after it is revealed that two elderly guests, Mr. and Mrs. Schumacher, stole Moe's wallet along with wallets of other guests.

While searching the scene, Carpenter found a gun beneath a bush. A ballistics expert was able to determine that the bullets fired at Hill had been handmade, {{and as a result}} of this Houston police were able to trace the weapon to a doctor. When questioned as to how the weapon had found its way to River Oaks, the doctor said it had been stolen by a woman whom he described as [...] "a whore". He went on to explain that he had entertained two prostitutes, who stole some money and one of his cars while he was sleeping. He had taken the gun and planned to go looking for the women, but as he was about to leave, he was called by another prostitute who called herself Dusty, who asked if he wanted company. While <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> he said, she took the gun. He then said he believed Dusty's real name was Marcia McKittrick. Carpenter, a former vice squad officer, used his old contacts to trace McKittrick, and discovered she was involved with Bobby Wayne Vandiver, an habitual criminal who had established himself as a pimp following his most recent release from prison.|$|E

2500|$|In 1962–1963, {{the popular}} female {{playback}} singer Lata Mangeshkar {{raised the issue}} of playback singers' share in the royalties. Recognizing Rafi's position as the leading male playback singer, she wanted him to back her in demanding a half-share from the 5 percent song royalty that the film's producer conceded to select composers. Lata's contention was {{that there was no way}} producers and music directors could deny this singing duo the royalty. Rafi stated that his claim on the filmmaker ended with his being paid his agreed fee for the song. After that, if the film proved a hit, the filmmaker was welcome to keep the Gramco (HMV) royalty he earned from it. If it did not prove to be a hit, argued Rafi, that he had already been paid the same fees for his song; so later the situation is resolved. Rafi stated that it is the producer who bets the money and the composer who creates the song, so his claim to the contribution of the song is compensated when the fees are paid. Lata viewed his stand as a stumbling block on the royalty issue and stated that it is because of the singer's name also that the records get sold. This difference of opinion subsequently led to differences between the two. During the recording of [...] "Tasveer Teri Dil Mein" [...] (Maya, 1961), Lata argued with Rafi over a certain passage of the song. Rafi felt belittled, as music director Salil Chowdhury sided with Lata. The situation worsened when Lata declared that she would no longer sing with Rafi. Rafi stated that he was only so keen to sing with Lata as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> The music director Jaikishan later negotiated a reconciliation between the two. In an interview given to The Times of India on September 25, 2012, Lata claimed to have received a written apology from Rafi. However, Shahid Rafi, Mohammad Rafi's son, rebuffs the claim, calling it an act to dishonor his father's reputation.|$|E
