50|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia's</b> gradual {{transition}} to self-governance. Representative government {{was introduced in}} 1924 when a constitution was established. Following the dissolution, <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> immediately agreed to become an associated state of Britain, which entailed a mutually sanctioned relationship that could be dissolved at any time by either <b>party.</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> was granted full control over its local government, with Britain retaining responsibility for foreign affairs and national defense. This arrangement lasted until 1975, {{when members of the}} West Indies Associated States chose to pursue independence at their discretion and convenience (see: The West Indies Federation, ch. 1). Following three years of planning and deliberation, <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> gained independence on February 22, 1979. <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> achieved full independence in ceremonies boycotted by the opposition <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> Labour <b>Party,</b> which had advocated a referendum before cutting ties with Britain. The United Workers Party (UWP), then in power, called for new elections and was defeated by the <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> Labour <b>Party</b> (SLP). The UWP was returned to power in the elections of 1982, 1987, and 1992.The United Workers Party (UWP) was once the dominant force in the politics of <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia.</b> Until 1997, John Compton was premier of <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> from 1964 until independence in February 1979 and remained prime minister until elections later that year.The <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> Labour <b>Party</b> (SLP) won the first post-independence elections in July 1979, taking 12 of 17 seats in parliament.The United Workers Party won an upset victory in elections held December 11, 2006, taking 11 seats against 6 won by the <b>St.</b> <b>Lucia</b> Labour <b>Party.</b> Sir John Compton once again returned to the position of Prime Minister, as well as Minister of Finance.|$|R
