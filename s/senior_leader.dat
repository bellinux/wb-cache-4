5|$|The {{events in}} Winnipeg {{highlighted}} the chaotic and ill-coordinated management of security issues across Canada, the artificial division between policing organisations {{in the west}} and east of the country, and the absence of a single <b>senior</b> <b>leader</b> for security work. Commissioner Perry recommended creating a new federal police force, ideally by amalgamating the Dominion Police into the existing mounted police force. The mounted police, he argued, were much larger, militarized, experienced and had a proven capacity to carry out secret intelligence work. They were also free from union influence and enjoyed high prestige among the public.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} rebels in the leadership, Rau kept {{most of his}} positions. He {{remained}} {{a member of the}} Politburo and deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers. In the Politburo he continued to be responsible for the industry of the GDR. However, his position had been weakened. Bruno Leuschner, a follower of Ulbricht and Rau's successor as chairman of the National Planning Commission, now became a new candidate member of the Politburo. During the ensuing period, Leuschner, often supported by Ulbricht, gradually superseded Rau as the <b>senior</b> <b>leader</b> for the economy as a whole. The official GDR press never mentioned the dissension between Rau and Leuschner and always described their cooperation as a success story.|$|E

This study revealed that organizations have a limited understanding of what is important to <b>senior</b> <b>leaders</b> as they think about their careers and almost no understanding of the strategies <b>senior</b> <b>leaders</b> use for career management. As a result the strategies that companies put in place will not allow them to retain and fully leverage this important segment of the workforce. Practical implications for <b>senior</b> <b>leaders</b> and their organizations are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|There are 1. 4 million active nonprofit {{organizations}} in the United States; however, funding sustainability often forces nonprofit <b>senior</b> <b>leaders</b> into closure, {{which can lead to}} increased unemployment and decreased services provided to local communities. Nonprofit <b>senior</b> <b>leaders</b> seek help from scholars, at times, to identify strategies to secure sustainable funding sources, improve the sustainability of funding, or prevent or reverse losses of funding to their organizations. Through the conceptual lens of the general systems theory, the 2015 - 2016 Baldrige Excellence Framework and Criteria, and single- and double-loop learning, this single-case study explored strategies used to secure sustainable funding for {{nonprofit organizations}} from businesses, foundations, and individual donations. Through a purposeful sample of 3 <b>senior</b> <b>leaders</b> of a small nonprofit organization located in Baltimore, Maryland, data collection occurred through semistructured interviews, a review of public and internal documents, as well as performance outcomes. Through thematic analysis, 4 themes emerged: process strengths, process opportunities, results strengths, and results opportunities. Identifying strategies to secure sustainable funding may assist nonprofit <b>senior</b> <b>leaders</b> when struggling in an environment in which the supply of critical resources is low. The findings have implications for positive social change for nonprofit <b>senior</b> <b>leaders</b> and the community. Nonprofit <b>senior</b> <b>leaders</b> that secure sustainable funding may offer a positive influence in communities by reducing unemployment, creating new jobs, providing tax payments, promoting philanthropy, and improving lives...|$|R

Nevertheless, his relatively low popularity rates among the general population have made his legacy a mixed blessing to his political allies, who are somewhat reluctant to embrace it wholeheartedly during elections, especially on topics regarding privatization and social policy. In 2006, he helped the campaign of the PSDB candidate for the Presidency, Geraldo Alckmin, and has reiterated that he does not wish to run for office again.|$|E

25|$|The legal {{proceedings}} were perceived {{by many as}} politically motivated; his party, the PPP, was in opposition to Musharraf, who had embarked on a campaign to coerce party members to switch sides.

His imprisonment was widely condemned by various individuals across the country, including Mushahid Hussain Syed, a <b>senior</b> <b>leader</b> of the PML-Q. He was released on 7 October 2006 from Adiala Jail, after spending {{more than five years}} in captivity.

25|$|On the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Patel supported Nehru's decision to withdraw the Congress from central and provincial legislatures, contrary to Gandhi's advice, {{as well as an}} initiative by <b>senior</b> <b>leader</b> Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari to offer Congress's full support to Britain if it promised Indian independence {{at the end of the}} war and installed a democratic government right away. Gandhi had refused to support Britain on the grounds of his moral opposition to war, while Subhash Chandra Bose was in militant opposition to the British. The British rejected Rajagopalachari's initiative, and Patel embraced Gandhi's leadership again. He participated in Gandhi's call for individual disobedience, and was arrested in 1940 and imprisoned for nine months. He also opposed the proposals of the Cripps' mission in 1942. Patel lost more than twenty pounds during his period in jail.|$|E

According to a witness, at least two AH-6 Little Bird attack helicopters strafed a two-car convoy. Navy SEALs then seized the body of Nabhan and took two other wounded fighters captive. JSOC and the CIA had been trying to kill Nabhan for some time including back in January 2007, when an AC-130 Gunship was called in on one attempt. A U.S. intelligence source stated that CIA paramilitary teams are directly embedded with Ethiopian forces in Somalia, allowing for the tactical intelligence to launch these operations. Nabhan was wanted for his involvement in the 1998 United States embassy bombings, as well as leading the cell behind the 2002 Mombasa attacks.|$|E
25|$|By 1899, Junimea {{was again}} merged into the Conservative Party. That year, Catargiu died, leaving open {{the issue of}} his {{succession}} to the Conservative Chairmanship. Carp {{took part in the}} subsequent race, but lost to Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, who probably received decisive support from King Carol. During the election, Carp found himself a new adversary, in the person of Take Ionescu. This highly popular and young Conservative, who preserved strong links with the PNL, helped swing the vote in favor of Cantacuzino. Carp sincerely believed that Ionescu was a problem for the Conservative Party, and stated that his major goal was proving to the world that Ionescu was not a genuine politician. He was especially vexed by Ionescu's indifference to an unwritten law, according to which the King had an ultimate say in foreign policies. Carp's influence was also being contested by the new current formed around the Conservative Study Circle. Through its speakers Filipescu and Dimitrie S. Nenițescu, the Circle began analyzing the need for complex electoral reforms. Filipescu admired the <b>senior</b> <b>leader,</b> but Carp felt that the generation gap was unbridgeable.|$|E
