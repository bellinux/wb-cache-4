25|$|When games come out, that's {{the end of}} development, but we don't {{consider}} {{our game}} done - it won't be done for years, because there's so much <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> can do. So after release we have tons of new quests we {{want to come out}} with, we're going to be adding new factions to the game to help liven things up further, we have a ton of new map styles we want to put in - all kinds of crazy new <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> can put in here.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stuff</b> <b>We</b> Found on eBay: Leno {{brought up}} some of the oddest stuff that he and members of the studio {{audience}} had supposedly found while searching on eBay.|$|E
25|$|Obviously we were {{committed}} to putting this album out, although it wasn't necessarily the best live <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> have. I don't look upon it as a live album...it's essentially a soundtrack.|$|E

[...] exclaimed {{the blue}} jay, [...] "we cannot be shot now, for <b>we</b> are <b>stuffed.</b> Indeed, two men fired several shots at us this morning, but the bullets only ruffled our {{feathers}} and buried themselves in our <b>stuffing.</b> <b>We</b> do not fear men now." ...|$|R

25|$|Also in 2011, Jawbone {{announced}} (and {{then paused}} production) of its lifestyle tracking system, UP by Jawbone. The UP wristband and accompanying app was first {{announced at the}} TED conference in Scotland in July 2011. Describing the company’s foray into health, Rahman told TechCrunch, “It seems like a big departure, but once we start talking about the things {{it takes to make}} this whole category work, we get into things like making it tiny, having a long battery life, making it fashionable, making it waterproof, working with smartphones, having a rich, visual experience on your smartphone and making it social. This is all <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> do anyway. It comes back around to the mission of your mobile lifestyle.” Highly anticipated by Jawbone fans and the media, the UP lifestyle tracker and app system launched in November 2011. FastCompany Design reported, “If UP works, it could augur a huge shift in the way we approach weight loss and staying healthy.” Jawbone halted production of the product a month later in response to widespread customer claims of issues with charging, syncing, and in some cases, product failure. The guarantee, offered purchasers of UP full refunds for any reason, even if they wanted to keep their wristbands.|$|E

500|$|McCartney {{was quoted}} as saying, [...] "I think it's {{a good idea to}} let people know about The Casbah. They know about The Cavern, they know about some of those things, but The Casbah was the place where all that started. We helped paint it and <b>stuff.</b> <b>We</b> looked upon it as our {{personal}} club." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell Issek, then, {{the mother}} of Arbalik, to come," [...] {{returned}} Nuna, making a wry face. [...] "If she is not stupid, she is wicked enough, and dreadful at lies. And the sisters Kabelaw and Sigokow; they are the worst liars in all the village, besides being stupider than puffins. There, that will be enough for our first feed. When these have <b>stuffed,</b> <b>we</b> can have more. Too many at once makes much cooking and little talk. Go, my child." ...|$|R

500|$|Jim Seavey, {{associate}} director of athletics stated: [...] "Twelve years ago, the college discarded the logo that depicted the Indian with the headdress and feathers and <b>stuff.</b> <b>We</b> really did {{not have anything to}} represent our identity that we were comfortable with. We felt... that it wasn't appropriate to have a physical representation of a Native American as our mascot".|$|E
500|$|Popular French bands such as Justice, Daft Punk and Phoenix {{have been}} known to include {{influences}} of The Age of Plastic. Justice said that they were [...] "totally fascinated by The Buggles’ first album [...] It’s full of <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> like - there’s a bit of electro, a bit of pop, a bit of classical going on there… We like the way they operated too, as an autonomous duo…" ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up {{much as they do}} live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch of stuff that was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast <b>stuff,</b> <b>we</b> can do slow <b>stuff,</b> <b>we</b> can do punk stuff. That was where I realized there were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Carrie, smiling, [...] "you {{needed some}} control. You wouldn't take the doctor's <b>stuff</b> and <b>we</b> couldn't keep you quiet. I reckon you are pretty obstinate." ...|$|R

5000|$|Coda was released, basically, {{because there}} was so much bootleg <b>stuff</b> out. <b>We</b> thought, [...] "Well, if there's that much interest, then we may as well put the rest of our studio stuff out".|$|R
500|$|... "I've {{done about}} three weeks with her, and we’re gonna do some more {{projects}} {{at the end of}} July. She’s just really cool. I think as far as artists reinventing themselves, she did it before anybody else. She kind of began that trend of actually coming back with a whole new look and style and sound and winning it and hitting the top of the charts. Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding. We really pushed the envelope with some of the <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> were doing." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} conducted in February 2015 with AMH TV, Mario Duplantier {{stated that the}} band {{was working on a}} new album. Further speaking with AMH TV, {{he went on to say}} that [...] "e spent two months...composing new stuff, composing new songs. And we feel very optimistic about the future. We're already enjoying a lot of the new <b>stuff.</b> <b>We</b> want to make the strongest album we can do. I mean, all the bands say they try to make the strongest album, but this time, I think we will really do it." ...|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{recorded}} it, even as our demo faded out, on the fade {{you could}} hear Tom saying, [...] "When your heart beats, and you hold me, and you love me..." [...] That {{was the last thing}} you heard as our demo faded. Madonna must have listened to it very, very carefully because her record ends with the exact same little ad-libs that our demo did. That rarely happens that someone studies your demo so carefully that they use all that <b>stuff.</b> <b>We</b> were sort of flattered how carefully she followed our demo on that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] sighed the girl, {{when she}} had {{disposed}} of her share, [...] "the white traders bring us a black <b>stuff</b> which <b>we</b> mix with water hot, and find it very good to drink." ...|$|R

500|$|Moore {{stated that}} he and Matheos had {{an idea of what}} style of music to write for Free as they [...] "both have similar {{feelings}} about what worked on the first album". He considered the album as [...] "more focused" [...] than its predecessor. He noted that Free continued [...] "the mood of some of the songs of the first album and the melodies and mixing up some of the heavy stuff with the programming. As opposed to the instrumental, straight ahead, progressive <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> did". He attributed the band's sound to the [...] "very different" [...] ideas he and Matheos' had.|$|E
500|$|With their {{previous}} albums Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), Radiohead replaced their guitar-led rock sound {{with a more}} electronic style. On tour in 2000 and 2001, the band learned how to perform the electronic music live, combining synthetic sounds with conventional rock instrumentation. Songwriter Thom Yorke said: [...] "Even with electronics, {{there is an element}} of spontaneous performance in using them. It was the tension between what's human and what's coming from the machines. That was <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> were getting into." [...] He stated that Radiohead did not want to make a [...] "big creative leap or statement" [...] with their next album.|$|E
500|$|Filming of {{the first}} {{exterior}} scene at Castle Black and the final scene with Jon Snow executing the traitors of the Night's Watch took place {{over the course of}} several months, with the execution scene being filmed first out of the two. As a result of a rock slide that occurred on the set of where Castle Black is staged at Magheramorne Quarry, scheduling for the filming of the scenes had to be re-worked by executive producer Bernie Caulfield and producer Chris Newman, with showrunner D. B. Weiss saying, [...] "It actually worked out for the best – some of the <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> were shooting in that location benefited from the additional prep time the rock slide gave us." ...|$|E
40|$|Hayes has {{identified}} two distinct ontologies for reasoning about liquids. Most qualitative physics {{research has focused}} on applying and generalizing his contained-liquid ontology. This paper presents a technique for generating descriptions using the molecular collection (MC) ontology, a specialization of his alternate ontology which represents liquids in terms of little &quot;pieces of stuff &quot; traveling through a system. We claim that MC descriptions are parasitic on the Contained-Stuff ontology, and present rules for generating MC descriptions given a Qualitative Process theory model using contained <b>stuffs.</b> <b>We</b> illustrate these rules using several implemented examples and discuss how this representation can be used to draw cornplex conclusions.

500|$|Hetrick {{felt that}} the move away from TNG gave Vash more independence, and she enjoyed the new {{relationship}} between Vash and Quark, calling them [...] "kindred spirits". [...] She was also pleased {{to be working with}} de Lancie again. [...] "I love the way they write for John, and I loved the <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> got to do together in 'Q-Less'", she said. Hetrick underwent ten hours of make-up for the sequence where Q shows Vash what could have happened if he did not save her life following an insect bite in the Gamma Quadrant. [...] The experience left her with a newfound appreciation for not having to wear prosthetics like other members of the cast.|$|E
500|$|According to Furtado, in the studio, Timbaland {{had some}} beats that were [...] "already kind of halfway there; {{and then he}} had beats that he just had nucleuses of; and then other <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> jammed together". While she was working with Timbaland and Danja in Miami, Pharrell Williams {{introduced}} Furtado to reggaeton, a musical genre that was unfamiliar to her. After he played a song for her, Furtado became inspired and wrote the lyrics to [...] "No Hay Igual" [...] "nearly on the spot". In an interview with MTV News, Furtado joked: [...] "Supposedly it was Pharrell's idea for me to work with Tim [...] Jimmy Iovine, the head of my record label , might beg to differ." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lazzara, Fazzi {{was a major}} {{contributor}} in writing New Again. The band was, [...] "Experimenting ... {{a lot of different}} instruments, horns, glockenspiels, there's a flautist on the record. And it's <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> never would've tried before." [...] Jillian Newman, the group's manager, also mentioned Fazzi's influence: [...] " [...] brought a really positive, happy energy to the band. A lot of the walls came down during writing. He allowed everybody to try new things." [...] With New Again, Lazzara considered his lyrics to be [...] "a lot more forward," [...] compared those on earlier songs. Reyes called the album [...] "one of the most aggressive records we've ever written". The album's sound has been described as pop punk, pop rock and post-hardcore.|$|E
