40|$|Summary: The {{study of}} flow {{separation}} from walls or solid objects {{is still an}} active research area in the fluid dynamics and flow visualization communities and many open questions remain. This paper aims at introducing a new method for the extraction of separation manifolds originating from <b>separation</b> <b>lines.</b> We address the problem from the flow visualization side by investigating features in flow cross sections around <b>separation</b> <b>lines.</b> We use the topological signature of the separation in these sections, in particular the presence of saddle points and their separatrices, {{as a guide to}} initiate the construction of the separation manifolds. Having this first part we use well known stream surface construction methods to propagate the surface further into the flow. Additionally, we discuss some lessons learned in the course of our experimentation with well known and new ideas for the extraction of <b>separation</b> <b>lines.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A fully {{automatic}} feature detection algorithm is presented that locates, and distinguishes, <b>lines</b> of flow <b>separation</b> and attachment on surfaces in 3 -D numerical flow fields. The algorithm {{is based on}} concepts from 2 -D phase plane analysis of linear vector fields. Unlike prior visualization techniques based on particle tracing or flow topology, the phase plane algorithm detects separation using local analytic tests. Results show that it not only detects the standard closed <b>separation</b> <b>lines</b> but also the illusive open <b>separation</b> <b>lines</b> which are not captured by flow topology methods. ...|$|R

40|$|Inflight {{results from}} surface and off surface flow {{visualizations}} and from extensive pressure distributions document the vortical flow {{on the leading}} edge extensions (LEXs) and forebody of the NASA F- 18 high alpha research vehicle (HARV) for low speeds and angles of attack up to 50 deg. Surface flow visualization data, obtained using the emitted fluid technique, were used to define <b>separation</b> <b>lines</b> and laminar <b>separation</b> bubbles (LSB). Off surface flow visualization data, obtained by smoke injection, were used to document both the path of the vortex cores and the location of vortex core breakdown. The location of vortex core breakdown correlated well with the loss of suction pressure on the LEX and with the flow visualization results from ground facilities.

40|$|We {{report about}} {{concentration}} {{results for the}} measure giving the statistical properties of phase <b>separation</b> <b>lines</b> in the 2 D Ising model. The results are sharp and valid for all temperatures below the critical one; they are consequences of a new approach for treating phase <b>separation</b> <b>lines</b> in the 2 D Ising model and the following interesting inequality of the surface tension ø (x) of an interface perpendicular to x: for any x, y ø (x) + ø (y) Γ ø (x + y) 1 (kxk + kyk Γ kx + yk); where is the maximum curvature of the Wulff shape and kxk the Euclidean norm of x. We apply these new techniques {{to the study of}} the pinning transition for the 2 D Ising model. One major result is that we can establish the thermodynamical variational problem, which holds at the macroscopic level, for this surface phenomenon, starting from the microscopic description of this model.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{in-flight}} surface flow visualization similar to wind-tunnel-model oil flows is described for cases where photo-chase planes or onboard photography are not practical. This method, used on an F- 18 aircraft in flight at high angles of attack, clearly showed surface flow streamlines in the fuselage forebody. Vortex <b>separation</b> and reattachment <b>lines</b> were identified with this method and documented using postflight photography. Surface flow angles {{measured at the}} 90 and 270 degrees meridians show excellent agreement with the wind tunnel data for a pointed tangent ogive with an aspect ratio of 3. 5. The <b>separation</b> and reattachment <b>line</b> locations were qualitatively similar to the F- 18 wind-tunnel-model oil flows but neither the laminar separation bubble nor the boundary-layer transition on the wind tunnel model were evident in the flight surface flows. The <b>separation</b> and reattachment <b>line</b> locations were in fair agreement with the wind tunnel data for the 3. 5 ogive.

40|$|In {{a variety}} of {{aeronautical}} applications, the flow around conical bodies at incidence is of interest. Such applications include, {{but are not limited}} to, highly maneuverable aircraft with delta wings, the aerospace plane and nose portions of spike inlets. The theoretical model used has three parts. First, the single line vortex model is used within the framework of slender body theory, to compute the outer inviscid field for specified <b>separation</b> <b>lines.</b> Next, the three dimensional boundary layer is represented by a momentum equation for the cross flow, analogous to that for a plane boundary layer; a von Karman Pohlhausen approximation is applied to solve this equation. The cross flow separation for both laminar and turbulent layers is determined by matching the pressure at the upper and lower separation points. This iterative procedure yields a unique solution for the <b>separation</b> <b>lines</b> and consequently for the position of the vortices and the vortex lift on the body. Lastly, control of separation is achieved by blowing tangentially from a slot located along a cone generator. It is found that for very small blowing coefficients, the separation can be postponed or suppressedy completely...|$|R

40|$|Toe Tip Necrosis Syndrome (TTNS) is a {{debilitating}} disease affecting the lower hind limb of cattle characterized by necrotic bone, wear or rounding of the hoof and {{breakdown of the}} white line region. This breakdown {{is thought to be}} the cause of TTNS, though this is unclear. The overall aim of this research was to investigate the hypothesis that mechanical damage and loading is the cause of the white <b>line</b> <b>separation,</b> which could ultimately lead to TTNS. Objective 1 of this research aimed to identify if loading is associated with white <b>line</b> <b>separation</b> and subsequently TTNS. Eleven diseased specimens and ten healthy specimens were loaded in a materials testing system against an acrylic plate. A camera, located underneath the hoof, imaged the apical region to identify the area of white <b>line</b> <b>separation.</b> Specimens were imaged using a High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) scanner with a contrast agent to assess the volume of separation. Objective 2 investigated whether mechanical damage under a fatigue loading regime would induce white <b>line</b> <b>separation.</b> Ten healthy pairs of specimens were tested (10 healthy, 10 with simulated damage) under fatigue loading for 36, 000 cycles at 1000 N. The results from Objective 1 indicated a positive association between loading and white <b>line</b> <b>separation</b> in diseased hooves. However, healthy hooves showed no separation. These findings support the hypothesis that mechanical loading is involved in TTNS etiology or disease exacerbation and acceleration. Findings from Objective 2 indicate no association between cycle count and white <b>line</b> <b>separation.</b> These results suggest that white <b>line</b> <b>separation</b> (and subsequent TTNS) may not be due to wear or prolonged repetitive loading. These results indicate that another loading parameter or a biological event likely initiates white <b>line</b> <b>separation</b> and ultimately TTNS...|$|R
