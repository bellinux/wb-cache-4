40|$|The current {{research}} aims {{to investigate the}} relationship between lifelong <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>learning.</b> Study group consists of 590 university students (390 females, 200 males) studying in different undergraduate programs in University of Sakarya, Faculty of Education in the Fall Term of 2015. In this research, relationships between the variables of lifelong <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>learning</b> were investigated. Pearson Product Moment Correlation, Partial Correlation methods were utilized so as to investigate these relationships. As consequence of the research, lifelong <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>learning</b> scores were correlating significantly. According to these results, it can be discussed that social <b>emotional</b> <b>learning</b> which can be explained as the behavioral reflection of <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> skills in a systematical and consistent way, has a positive relationship with lifelong learning which {{can be defined as}} all kinds of learning including formal or informal through one's life. Results are discussed {{within the context of the}} associated literature...|$|R

5000|$|Brackett is {{the lead}} {{developer}} of RULER, an evidence-based, CASEL (Collaborative for Academic, <b>Social,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Emotional</b> <b>Learning)</b> SELect approach to <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>learning.</b> The acronym RULER refers to the five key emotion skills of Recognizing, Understanding, Labeling, Expressing, and Regulating emotions. RULER intends to increase personal wellbeing, effective teaching and leadership, academic achievement, and classroom emotional climate change. [...] An essential aspect of RULER is that it involves training for educational leaders, teachers, support staff, students and families. To date, RULER has been adopted by 1200 schools across the globe, reaching over 1,000,000 students.|$|E

40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) shapes brain {{networks}} during {{development and}} modulates {{a wide spectrum}} of essential neuronal functions ranging from perception and cognitive appraisal to emotional responses in the mature brain. Deficits in 5 -HT-moderated synaptic signaling fundamentally impact the pathophysiology and long-term outcome of neurodevelopmental disorders. Our understanding of how 5 -HT-dependent modulation of circuit configuration influences <b>social</b> cognition <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>learning</b> has been enhanced by recent insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of synapse formation and plasticity. In this review, we discuss emerging concepts as to how defects in synaptic plasticity impact our biosocial brain and how recent findings regarding 5 -HT’s role in brain development and function provide insight into the cellular and physiological basis of neurodevelopmental disorders...|$|R
50|$|The DIR {{model was}} {{developed}} to tailor to each child and to involve families much more intensively than approaches have in the past. Through the DIR model, cognition, language, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> skills are <b>learned</b> through relationships that involve emotionally meaningful exchanges. Likewise, the model views children as being individuals who are very different and who vary in their underlying sensory processing and motor capacities. As such, all areas of child development are interconnected and work together beneficially.|$|R

40|$|The only {{cause of}} FASD is alcohol use during pregnancy. When a {{pregnant}} woman drinks, the alcohol crosses the placenta into the fetal blood system. Thus, alcohol reaches the fetus, its developing tissues, and organs.

No alcohol consumption is safe during pregnancy. In addition, the type of alcohol (beer, wine, hard liquor, wine cooler, etc.) does not appear to make a difference. PREVALENCE OF FASD FASD occurs in about 10 per 1, 000 live births, or about 40, 000 babies per year.

50|$|NAGC is a not-for-profit {{organisation}} {{that supports}} the <b>social,</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> needs of children with high learning potential {{of all ages and}} backgrounds. This includes children who have been identified as gifted and talented; children who have the potential to achieve through a wide range of abilities in academic subjects, sport, the arts and leadership; those who are twice exceptional (giftedness coupled with a disability or learning difficulty) and the profoundly gifted.|$|R
40|$|Gifted {{children}} have unique <b>social,</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> needs, which if not met {{may result in}} negative effects on their emotional well-being. The {{aim of this study}} was to understand the experiences of nine primary school age gifted children within their New Zealand learning environments and to examine how these experiences affected their emotional well-being. A narrative research design was used to generate stories, based on interviews with their parents, of the children’s experiences in their learning environments. The overarching theme, present in all the parents’ accounts, was that a sense of belonging within the learning environment was vital to the well-being of their children. On the occasions when the children felt that they did not belong within their <b>learning</b> environment their <b>emotional</b> well-being suffered. A sense of belonging was found to occur when the children’s <b>social,</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> needs were catered for. Advocacy by the parents and appropriate pedagogy of the classroom teachers were fundamental to ensuring that this sense of belonging was nurtured. Recommendations stemming from this study include the provision for the training of pre-service and in-service teachers in recognising and responding to the needs of gifted children...|$|R
30|$|A UK {{example of}} a personality-targeted {{intervention}} is SEAL (<b>Social</b> <b>and</b> <b>Emotional</b> Aspects of <b>Learning),</b> a voluntary programme designed to develop the <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> skills of all school pupils {{in the areas of}} self-awareness, managing feelings, empathy, motivation <b>and</b> <b>social</b> skills. SEAL is currently being implemented in around 90 % of primary schools and 70 % of secondary schools (Hallam et al. 2006). Very recently, following {{a review of the literature}} (Gutman and Schoon 2013), the Department of Education has embraced the idea that such non-cognitive skills might have important effects. For example, the Department has recently run a competition whereby schools outline their own experiences with ad hoc initiatives.|$|R

40|$|M. Ed. (Educational Psychology) Art {{making is}} seen as an {{opportunity}} to express one's self imaginatively, authentically, and spontaneously, an experience that, over time, can lead to personal fulfilment, <b>emotional</b> reparation, <b>and</b> recovery (Malchiodi, 2003). Taking into consideration the South African context, and the many psychological, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> barriers, through the creation of art and reflecting on the art products and methods people can increase awareness of self and others. It will also aid in coping with symptoms of stress and traumatic experiences, and enhance cognitive abilities (American Art Therapy Association, 2002). The aim of the paper is to assess and provide feedback on how learners experience the introduction of creative expressive arts activities into their school curriculum within the Life Orientation subject,. The research followed a phenomenological research design through the purposive sampling of nine learners from a school for learners with special educational needs. Data was collected through the means of group interviews, incomplete sentences and observations, then analysed by means of thematic analysis. Using socio-cultural theory as my literature framework and a socio-constructivist research paradigm, two main themes emerged. The first was that the learners experienced inter-personal development, which linked to the second theme of intra-personal development, through a psychological timeframe. Furthermore, I was able to determine which activities the learners enjoyed and which would need to be included in future creative expressive arts activities for the enjoyment of the learners. Through the emergence of this research the school communities will be better informed as to the value that creative expressive arts engagement could have in a school setting...|$|R

Seven primary schools in Dorset, a local authority in the South of England, implemented Family SEAL in a pilot project during 2007 – 2008. Both class teachers and parents reported post-programme gains in children’s <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> competence, <b>and</b> significant gains were reported for those children who had previously {{been identified as a}} cause for concern in their <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> development.
