5|$|The Aurora Bridge (officially {{called the}} George Washington Memorial Bridge) is a {{cantilever}} and truss bridge that carries State Route 99 (Aurora Avenue North) {{over the west}} end of Seattle's Lake Union and connects Queen Anne and Fremont.

5|$|In {{classical}} antiquity, the Via Flavia road {{built by}} the emperor Vespasian in 78AD ran through the same area <b>spanned</b> <b>by</b> modern D21. The Via Flavia followed a northsouth route {{in the western part}} of the Istrian Peninsula, connecting Tergeste, present-day Trieste, to Pula via Poreč. In Pula, the Roman road extended further to the northeast to Nesactium and Tarsatica modern-day Trsat area of the city of Rijeka.|$|E
5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the dimension of the vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is <b>spanned</b> <b>by</b> finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E

40|$|Objectives - To examine {{within an}} {{economically}} homogeneous group {{whether there is}} a gradient in life <b>span</b> <b>by</b> position in the social hierarchy. Methods - Using birth and death information for British peers and baronets, we calculated average life span (in years) for first- and inherited-title holders separately, by century of birth, and by peerage type. As well, we regressed life spans on peerage type, adjusting for century of birth and age at award. Results - There appears to be no gradient in life <b>span</b> <b>by</b> position in the social hierarchy even after accounting for cohort and selection effects. For inherited-title holders, peers of several peerage types have shorter life spans than peers in the lowest position in the social hierarchy. Conclusions - The lack of a gradient in life <b>span</b> <b>by</b> position in the social hierarchy suggests the need to continue exploring factors related to life within in economic hierarchy. longevity, gradient, socioeconomic...|$|R

The lobby extends completely through the block, with a giant entrance hall at Monroe Street and a 16-story full-height atrium in {{the link between the}} AT and USG towers (also designed by Smith) as both towers share a common appearance. The building boasts two public lobbies and a mezzanine-level lobby. The lobbies are among the most lavish in Chicago, and they are all decorated with patterned marble floors and walls, bronze, gold-leaf oak trim, and stylized lighting fixtures.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of {{the route}} runs through forested areas, {{especially}} near the Učka range and near Pazin, with agricultural land in between those areas– most of it located between the Ivoli and Lupoglav interchanges. The final section of the route, near Opatija and the A7 motorway, runs through coastal areas affected by urbanization. The route crosses no major watercourses, although creeks adjacent to or <b>spanned</b> <b>by</b> the route drain into the Pazinčica and Boljunčica rivers, or directly into the Adriatic Sea {{in the case of}} watercourses flowing down Učka's eastern slopes. The Učka Tunnel contains a spring discovered during its construction and used for the water supply of Opatija ever since.|$|E
5|$|The {{final section}} of the motorway, the northernmost section between the Umag {{interchange}} and the Slovenian border at Kaštel and Dragonja border crossing, is currently <b>spanned</b> <b>by</b> a two-lane connector road via a roundabout located at the provisional northern terminus of the A9. Since the Kaštel and Dragonja border crossing is the agreed contact point for the motorway link between Croatia and Slovenia, the section {{is expected to be}} built when Slovenia completes its H5 expressway; connecting the border crossing to Koper and its motorway system. The Slovenian motorway development company DARS made plans in 2010 to build the expressway.|$|E

5|$|The Sava River {{valley is}} also a route for road and rail traffic. The river valley routes {{are a part of}} the Pan-European Corridor X, and forming {{junctions}} with Pan-European Corridors V, Vb, Vc, Xa and Xb in area of Ljubljana (V), Zagreb (Vb, Xa), Slavonski Šamac (Vc), and Belgrade (Xb). The motorways forming the Pan-European Corridor X in the area—Slovenia's A2, Croatia's A3 and Serbia's A1 motorways—represent a part of European route E70 Bordeaux–Turin–Ljubljana–Zagreb–Belgrade–Bucharest, and the European route E61 Villach–Ljubljana–Trieste–Rijeka. A largely double track railroad with a railway electrification system {{is also a}} part of the Corridor X. The railroad was a part of the Simplon-Orient-Express and Direct-Orient-Express routes. The navigable river course between Belgrade and Galdovo north of Sisak is <b>spanned</b> <b>by</b> 25bridges. The Sava River valley east of Sisak is also used as a route for the Jadranski naftovod, a crude oil pipeline. The system connects the Port of Rijeka oil terminal to oil refineries in Rijeka and Sisak, to Brod in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as Novi Sad and Pančevo in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Copano Bay is {{approximately}} twelve-by-six-miles, oriented {{from the southwest}} to the northeast. It is found mainly on undeveloped land, though ranches are located on parts of the west, south and north shores. The main extensions include Mission Bay, which stretches to the north {{to the mouth of}} the Mission River, and Port Bay to the west, which forms the southern boundary of the Live Oak peninsula. The peninsula is located on the eastern shore of Copano Bay and is lined with beach homes and residences, which begin just west of the inlet Salt Lake to the head of Live Oak peninsula at the confluence of Copano and Aransas Bay. This opening is <b>spanned</b> <b>by</b> the Copano Bay Causeway and the Copano Bay Fishing Pier, which once served as the main crossing to the Lamar peninsula. Holiday Beach is found on the northeastern shore of Copano Bay on the Lamar Peninsula. Just north of the community is the mouth of Copano Creek, which marks the bay's northernmost point. From here, the shoreline turns to the southwest past the Copano Bay Oil and Gas Field and four sloughs before reaching the ruins of the ghost town Copano at Copano Point, marked by white cliffs. At the point, the Copano Reef juts out almost halfway across the bay. Further southwest, past the mouth of Mission Bay, Bayside stretches along the coast to the mouth of the Aransas River. The shoreline turns to the southeast from this point, past the Egery Flats and Egery Island through Swan Lake and to the mouth of Port Bay.|$|E
5|$|In central Bristol, {{where the}} river is tidal, it is {{diverted}} from its original course into the New Cut, a channel dug between 1804 and 1809 {{at a cost of}} £600,000. The original course is held at a constant level by lock gates (designed by Jessop) and is known as the Floating Harbour. The Floating Harbour is protected by an 1870s replacement for Jessop's locks. This unusual dock has a tentacled plan resulting from its origins as the natural river course of the Avon and its tributaries, the River Frome and Siston Brook, and is intimately entwined with Bristol's city centre as few docks are. As a result of this, the Floating Harbour {{is one of the more}} successful pieces of dockland regeneration, with much of the dockside now occupied by residential, office and cultural premises, and the water area heavily used by leisure craft. The Floating Harbour gave the port an advantage by enabling shipping to stay afloat rather than grounding when the tide went down. Downstream of central Bristol the river passes through the deep Avon Gorge, <b>spanned</b> <b>by</b> Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, the river is tidal and is navigable by seagoing vessels at high tide but drying to a steep sided muddy channel at low tide. It was largely the challenge of navigating this section that sealed the fate of the Floating Harbour as commercial docks and saw them replaced by docks at Avonmouth where the Avon joins the Severn Estuary.|$|E
