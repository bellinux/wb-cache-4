By using <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> P phase was identified. At the 950 ÂC treated samples, it could be possible to identify, by using X-ray <b>diffraction</b> and <b>electron,</b> the same stages that has been told above, except for the carbide M 23 C 6 type. At this type, plaques were formed close to the interface with the base metal due to carbon migration from base metal (ASTM A 36 Steel) to the nickel alloy and to the high temperature, which favors its formation. The precipitation had a great influence on the corrosion resistance of the samples. The alloy has been subjected to the immersion corrosion test according to ASTM G 48 C method and anything samples had fail in temperature of 40 ÂC...|$|R
