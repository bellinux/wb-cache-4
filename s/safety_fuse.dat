25|$|Before {{gunpowder}} {{was applied}} to civil engineering, there were two ways to break up large rocks, by hard labor or by heating with large fires followed by rapid quenching. The earliest record {{for the use of}} gunpowder in mines comes from Hungary in 1627. It was introduced to Britain in 1638 by German miners, after which records are numerous. Until the invention of the <b>safety</b> <b>fuse</b> by William Bickford in 1831, the practice was extremely dangerous. Another reason for danger were the dense fumes given off and the risk of igniting flammable gas when used in coal mines.|$|E

50|$|Modern day <b>safety</b> <b>fuses</b> {{are often}} used in mining and {{military}} operations, to provide a time-delay before ignition, and they {{more often than not}} are used to initiate an explosive detonator, thereby starting an explosive chain reaction to detonate a larger more stable main charge. <b>Safety</b> <b>fuses</b> are typically colored green or black (military) or fluorescent orange (commercial) to distinguish them from detonating cords such as Primacord, which are brightly colored or transparent.|$|R

As <b>safety</b> <b>fuse</b> is designed to neither give nor take fire through the heavy fuse jacket, ignition may be achieved by punching a hole perpendicular to and through a <b>safety</b> <b>fuse</b> powder core, threading a piece of Thermalite or similar igniter cord through the hole, then gently squeezing the <b>safety</b> <b>fuse</b> with pliers or similar to bring the powder core into contact with the igniter cord. The Thermalite could be ignited by a match, or more certainly by a purpose made igniter, similar to a wire sparkler.|$|E

5000|$|Dyno Nobel's history {{dates back}} to 1865 with Swedish {{dynamite}} inventor Alfred Nobel. [...] The invention of the <b>Safety</b> <b>Fuse</b> by William Bickford in 1831 was also instrumental in the company’s development.|$|E
50|$|An {{expedient}} formerly used {{to ignite}} bickford style safety fuses was {{to split the}} end of a <b>safety</b> <b>fuse,</b> place a match head into the split and tie the split back together, holding the match head against the powder core. This technique was slower, cumbersome and more failure prone than piercing and cross matching. Also, a single length of igniter cord could pass through and serially ignite multiple pieces of <b>safety</b> <b>fuse</b> attached to various charges in more complex, multiple charge blasting schemes. This technique and the several burn rate types of igniter cord manufactured by ICI could be used to implememt quite complex ignition sequences.|$|E
5000|$|Given the {{unreliability}} of fuses {{and means}} of detonation prior to Bickford’s fuse, this new technology changed the safety and conditions of mining. Due to poor record keeping or lack thereof, it is relatively difficult to determine {{the exact number of}} mining accidents and related statistics prior to the invention of the <b>safety</b> <b>fuse.</b> However [...] "this fuse soon replaced the less reliable fuses which were made of straws or quills filled with black powder, thus greatly reducing the hazard of accidental explosions in mining or construction." [...] Word of the reliability of Bickford's <b>safety</b> <b>fuse</b> spread, and was soon in large demand across world markets.|$|E
50|$|Smith {{then became}} a {{business}} partner of William Bickford, his father-in-law.

5000|$|IM (1943-1944): A {{mixture of}} Gasoline and an {{incendiary}} compound thickener. It was ignited with an M3 fuze {{attached to the}} bottle with a Timmerman strap safety. The M3 Igniter fuze assembly consisted of a fuze body, a striker, and a [...]38-caliber Blank cartridge. The Timmerman Strap was a metal band under tension around {{the surface of the}} grenade that was hooked up to a striker <b>safety</b> in the <b>fuse</b> body. (If the bottle broke prematurely, the Timmerman strap safety would prevent the striker from going off on impact.) The user pulled the safety pin from the fuse assembly and threw the bottle against the target. When the bottle broke, the Timmerman strap fell off, deactivating the strap safety and allowing the striker to engage. The fuze spring in the fuze body activated the striker, which struck the cartridge. The blank cartridge set off a flash, which ignited the liquid filler.|$|R
50|$|Ordinary {{detonators}} {{usually take}} the form of ignition-based explosives. Whilst they are mainly used in commercial operations, ordinary detonators are still used in military operations. This form of detonator is most commonly initiated using <b>safety</b> <b>fuse,</b> and used in non time-critical detonations e.g. conventional munitions disposal. Well known detonators are lead azide, Pb(N3)2, silver azide (AgN3) and mercury fulminate Hg(ONC)2.|$|E
50|$|The {{commercial}} use of explosives uses electrical detonators or the capped fuse {{which is a}} length of <b>safety</b> <b>fuse</b> to which an ordinary detonator has been crimped.

50|$|The Central Pacific {{made great}} {{progress}} along the Sacramento Valley. However construction was slowed, {{first by the}} foothills of the Sierra Nevada, then by the mountains themselves and most importantly by winter snowstorms. Consequently, the Central Pacific expanded its efforts to hire immigrant laborers (many of whom were Chinese). The immigrants seemed to be more willing to tolerate the horrible conditions, and progress continued. The increasing necessity for tunnelling then began to slow progress of the line yet again. To combat this, Central Pacific began to use the newly invented and very unstable nitro-glycerine explosives - which accelerated both the rate of construction and the mortality of the Chinese laborers. Appalled by the losses, the Central Pacific began to use less volatile explosives, and developed a method of placing the explosives in which the Chinese blasters worked from large suspended baskets that were rapidly pulled to <b>safety</b> after the <b>fuses</b> were lit.|$|R
40|$|Internationally, drowsy {{driving is}} {{associated}} with around 20 % of all crashes. Despite the development of different detection methods, driver drowsiness remains a disconcerting public health issue. Detection methods can estimate drowsiness by directly measuring the physiology of the driver, or they can measure the effect that drowsiness has {{on the state of}} the vehicle due to the behavioural changes that drowsiness elicits in the driver. The latter has the benefit that it could measure the net effect that drowsiness has on driving performance which links to the actual <b>safety</b> risk. <b>Fusing</b> multiple sources of driving performance indicators like lane position and steering wheel metrics in order to detect drowsiness has recently gained increased attention. However, not much research has been conducted with regard to using integrated measures to detect increased drowsiness within an individual driver. Different levels of drowsiness are also rarely classified in terms of safe or unsafe. In the present study, we attempt to slowly induce drowsiness using a monotonous driving task in a simulator, and fuse lane position and steering wheel angle data into a single measure for lateral control performance. We argue that this measure is applicable in real-time detection systems, and quantitatively link it to different levels of drowsiness by validating it to two established drowsiness metrics (KSS and PERCLOS). Using level of drowsiness as a surrogate for safety we are then able to set simple criteria for safe and unsafe lateral control performance, based on individual driving behaviour. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
