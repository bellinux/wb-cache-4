25|$|After George Pullman's {{death in}} 1897, Robert Todd Lincoln, son of Abraham Lincoln, became company president. The company closed its {{factory in the}} Pullman {{neighborhood}} of Chicago in 1955.

25|$|Roach had {{recognized}} {{the growing demand}} for steel products in the U.S. economy, and in 1880 he established the Combination Steel and Iron Company downriver from his Chester shipyard, which began production in January 1881. He soon discovered however that U.S. steelmakers could {{not keep up with}} national demand, so he also established his own steel manufacturing company, the <b>Standard</b> <b>Steel</b> Casting Company, which began production early in 1884. All these new facilities would soon be utilized for supplying steel to his shipyard.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to rail vehicles, Pullman-Standard also manufactured trolley buses — or trolley coaches, {{as they were}} more commonly known at the time – starting in 1931 and concluding in late 1952. A total of 2,007 trolley buses were built by the company. Production took place at a former Osgood Bradley Car Company plant in Worcester, Massachusetts, which had come under Pullman control {{as part of its}} 1929/30 acquisition of a controlling interest in the <b>Standard</b> <b>Steel</b> Car Company. The vast majority were built for U.S. cities, with only 24 being supplied to Canadian cities and a total of 136 built for cities in South America. The very last trolleybuses built were an order of 30 for Valparaíso, Chile, in late 1952. That city's Pullman trolley buses have far outlasted any others, and as of 2015 about a dozen were still in regular service there, four from the 1952 batch and the others from a larger group built in 1946–48 but partially rebuilt in 1987–88. In 2003, the remaining 15 were declared a National Historic Monument by the Chilean government.|$|E
