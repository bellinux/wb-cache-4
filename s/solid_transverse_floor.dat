500|$|Junk (ship): The Chinese junk, {{derived from}} the Portuguese term junco (which in turn was adapted from the Javanese djong meaning [...] "ship"), was a ship design unique to China, {{although}} many other ship types in China (such as the towered lou chuan) preceded it. Its origins {{could be seen in}} the latter half of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), when ship designs began to have square-ended bows and sterns with flat bottom hulls. Unlike the earliest shipbuilding traditions of the Western world and South Asia, the junk had a (flat or slightly rounded) carvel-shaped hull which lacked a keel and sternpost (necessitating block and tackle or socket-and-jaw attachment of the Chinese rudder). Since there is no keel in the design, <b>solid</b> <b>transverse</b> bulkheads take the place of structural ribs. There are many theories about the evolution of the junk. One suggests that it developed from the double canoe, another claims that the bamboo raft used by Taiwanese aboriginals was the source of the junk. Records by Western travelers in China during the Song Dynasty mention that junks could support 130 sailors. The size of junks grew during the Ming Dynasty. By the 14th century, junks could carry 2,000 tons. Archaeological evidence of the large size of the junk has been proven by a sunken junk discovered in 1973 near the coast of Southeastern China.|$|R
40|$|Computer-generated environments {{have been}} {{established}} as valuable training media for both proximal-field object manipulation and wide-area navigation performance. This study investigates the potential of virtual environments-based computer training for near-field navigation accuracy. Results of this investigation revealed significantly greater performance accuracy in a real-world setting for subjects that were first trained in a virtual environment. In addition, three levels of rendered visual detail were compared for precision of movement within a virtual hallway: (1) uutextured polygon surfaces, (2) untextured polygon surfaces with <b>transverse</b> <b>floor</b> gradient lines placed as visual cues, and (3) fully detailed textured surfaces. Significant effects were found for visual detail in accuracy of movement production. Within the virtual environment, performance rror in the uudetailed setting was signifi-cantly higher {{as compared to the}} settings with visual cues and textures. Significant differences in real-world field performance were also found between the groups that were exposed to different levels of visual detail in computer training. Field performance was significantly superior for subjects trained with visual cues as compared to those trained in an uutextured virtual setting. Evidence suggests that for movement production accuracy both within a virtual environment and in the real world fully-detailed textured surfaces are not required in the rendered setting in order to obtain the best performance. Simple surface gradients erve as adequate visual cues for near-field navi-gation accuracy, while a lack of consistent visual cues can be detrimental to effective movement production...|$|R

5|$|The southward {{expansion}} of the Han dynasty led to new trade routes and diplomatic contact with foreign kingdoms. In 111 BCE, Emperor Wu conquered the Kingdom of Nanyue {{in what is now}} modern northern Vietnam and Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan; thereafter he opened up maritime trade to both Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, as foreign merchants brought lapis lazuli, pearls, jade, and glasswares to the Han Empire from this southern sea route. When a group of travelers from the Roman Empire (allegedly diplomats of Marcus Aurelius but most likely Roman merchants) came to the Han court in 166 CE, they allegedly came from this southern trade route. By at least the 1st century CE— as proven by Eastern Han ceramic miniature models of ships found in various tombs— the Chinese {{would have been able to}} brave distant waters with the new steering invention of the stern-mounted rudder. This came to replace the less efficient steering oar. While ancient China was home to various ship designs, including the layered and fortified tower ship meant for calm waters of lakes and river, the junk design (jun 船) created by the 1st century CE was China's first seaworthy sailing ship. The typical junk has a square-ended bow and stern, a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost, and <b>solid</b> <b>transverse</b> bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western seacrafts. Since the Chinese junk lacked a sternpost, the rudder was attached to the back of the ship by use of either socket-and-jaw or block and tackle (which differed from the later European pintle and gudgeon design of the 12th century). As written by a 3rd-century author, junks had for-and-aft rigs and lug sails.|$|R

Established liquid-state MRI strategies are generally found to be inappropriate for the imaging of rigid solids, because the linewidth for nuclear magnetic resonance in solids is orders-of-magnitude larger than in liquids. Methods currently under development for the NMR imaging of solids either involve the use of very large (fringe-field) magnetic field gradients to encode spatial information over very {{short periods of time}} [2], or employ multiple-pulse line-narrowing techniques that prolong a <b>solid’s</b> apparent <b>transverse</b> relaxation time [3 – 7].

The {{first is a}} general strategy for recording spin density maps from solids through improved nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. The second involves ultrasensitive methods for detecting nuclear magnetic resonance optically and is applicable to semiconductors at low temperature. Conventional liquids magnetic resonance imaging (MRJ) protocols fail in solids, where rapid local-field dephasing of nuclear magnetization precludes the frequency encoding of spatial information with conventional magnetic field gradients. In our approach, a multiple-pulse line-narrowing sequence is delivered with a solenoid coil to prolong a <b>solid's</b> effective <b>transverse</b> relaxation time. A radiofrequency gradient coil, delivering resonant pulses whose amplitude varies across the sample, is driven {{in concert with the}} line-narrowing coil to encode spatial information. The practical implementation of this protocol demanded the construction of an active Q-spoiling circuit to negate coupling of the two isoresonant coils. Two-dimensional Fourier-zeugmatographic images of hexamethylbenzene have been obtained that exhibit 300 µm x 300 µm planar resolution. This imaging protocol is one of the highest sensitivity methods for imaging solids by NMR (the other involves line narrowing and pulsed DC gradients). Extraordinary increases in detection sensitivity are required for NMR to study epitaxial semiconductor devices. Optical pumping is one route to such increased sensitivity.

The roadbed was built wide enough to accommodate two sets of tracks, but only one set was originally installed. To accommodate the second track the granite parapets were removed. The parapets were 36" [...] high × 12" [...] wide topped with 8" [...] high × 18" [...] wide coping for a total height of 3'-8". The Dedication Stone was tossed off the viaduct and lay broken in a field for 18 years. The Dedication Stone is the only known remnant of the parapets.

Above a critical force $F_c$ we find two dynamical phase transitions at $F_p$ and $F_t$, with $F_c<F_p<F_t$. At $F_p$ there is a transition from plastic flow to smectic flow where the noise is isotropic and there is a peak in the differential resistance.
