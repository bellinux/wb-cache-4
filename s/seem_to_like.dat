5|$|The Gila monster {{is found}} in the Southwestern United States and Mexico, a range {{including}} Sonora, Arizona, parts of California, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico (potentially including Baja California). They inhabit scrubland, succulent desert, and oak woodland, seeking shelter in burrows, thickets, and under rocks in locations with ready access to moisture. In fact, Gila monsters <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> water and can be observed immersing themselves in puddles of water after a summer rain. They avoid living in open areas such as flats and farmland.|$|E

25|$|Although {{fighting}} is officially prohibited in the rules, {{it is not}} an uncommon occurrence at the professional level, and its prevalence has been both a target of criticism and a considerable draw for the sport. At the professional level in North America fights are unofficially condoned. Enforcers and other players fight to demoralize the opposing players while exciting their own, as well as settling personal scores. A fight will also break out if one of the team's skilled players gets hit hard or someone gets hit by what the team perceives as a dirty hit. The amateur game penalizes fisticuffs more harshly, as a player who receives a fighting major is also assessed at least a 10-minute misconduct penalty (NCAA and some Junior leagues) or a game misconduct penalty and suspension (high school and younger, as well as some casual adult leagues). Crowds <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> fighting in ice hockey and cheer when fighting erupts.|$|E

500|$|Stewart-Beer and Austen scholar Sally B. Palmer noted {{alterations}} {{within the}} depiction of the Bennet family; Stewart-Beer remarked that while their family home [...] "might be chaotic, in this version it is, at heart, a happy home—much happier and much less dysfunctional, than Austen's original version of Longbourn... For one, Mr and Mrs Bennet actually <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> each other, even love each other, a characterisation which {{is a far cry}} from the source text." [...] Producer Paul Webster acknowledged the familial theme in the DVD featurette [...] "A Bennet Family Portrait", remarking [...] "Yes, it's a great love story between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, but underpinning it all is the kind of love that runs this family." ...|$|E
500|$|Composer Mark Snow {{worked with}} {{producer}} Ken Horton to create Smallvilles score. Snow composed music {{as he watched}} the picture, and tweaked his performance when he reviewed his initial recordings. He then sent the music to the producers, who sent it back for recomposition if needed. Individual episodes have their own soundtrack, comprising one (or more) songs. Jennifer Pyken and Madonna Wade-Reed of Daisy Music looked for songs for the soundtrack. Their choices were discussed by the producers, who decided which songs they wanted and secured their rights. Although Snow said it initially seemed odd to combine two types of music on a [...] "typical action-adventure" [...] television show, [...] "the producers <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> the contrast of the modern songs and the traditional, orchestral approach to the score".|$|E

500|$|The two symphonies divide opinion {{even more}} sharply. Mason rates the Second poorly for its [...] "over-obvious rhythmic scheme", but calls the First [...] "Elgar's masterpiece. ... It {{is hard to}} see how any candid student can deny the greatness of this symphony." [...] However, in the 1957 centenary symposium, several leading admirers of Elgar express {{reservations}} about one or both symphonies. In the same year, Roger Fiske wrote in The Gramophone, [...] "For some reason few people <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> the two Elgar symphonies equally; each has its champions and often they are more than a little bored by the rival work." [...] The critic John Warrack wrote, [...] "There are no sadder pages in symphonic literature than the close of the First Symphony's Adagio, as horn and trombones twice softly intone a phrase of utter grief", whereas to Michael Kennedy, the movement is notable for its lack of anguished yearning and angst and is marked instead by a [...] "benevolent tranquillity." ...|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{particularly}} well received by female Holby City fans, elevating Irving to sex-symbol status. The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's difficult to put your finger on what he has. I think it's got something to do with being a character who says exactly what he means all the time. He's got integrity, which I admire anyway, and I expect the audience responds to that. Surgeons <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> him too. I find that particularly gratifying. He's got the courage to do what's right for his work and his patients and not worry about popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E
500|$|Shatner {{says that}} acting in Star Trek was [...] "life-consuming" [...] {{and left him}} [...] "barely any time for family", {{and that this was}} the reason for his divorce from Gloria Rand, his first wife. He {{describes}} a subsequent succession of sexual partners, including, he says, Star Trek actresses. He also talks about the death of his father, Joseph Shatner, and of his third wife, Nerine Kidd, who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999, losing a battle with alcoholism. Shatner recalls that Nimoy had expressed concern about Kidd's alcoholism and warned him about marrying her. Another topic is Nimoy's fine-art photography, which deals with spirituality and sensuality. Both Shatner and Nimoy say that, while they are glad that Star Trek became successful, they wish their subsequent fame had encroached less on their privacy. They also describe having been typecast {{as a result of their}} roles in Star Trek, and say that this has had repercussions on their respective acting careers. Shatner recounts his initial surprise that, at science fiction conventions, the fans <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> each other more than they like the science fiction actors. The film concludes with Nimoy putting his arm around Shatner's shoulder and saying, [...] "You're my best friend." ...|$|E

500|$|Giuliani {{continued}} to ponder his senate race decision; {{when he had}} dinner with Nathan on May 12, they were trailed by a flock of photographers. [...] Giuliani canceled campaigning and fundraising trips to upstate New York and California on May 13, suggesting he would not run, but then resumed fundraising and suggested he was inclined towards running on May 15. [...] Two Republican county chairmen became upset at the indecision, saying, [...] "Like Waiting for Godot, we have Waiting for Rudy", and, [...] "We need a decision. Like tomorrow would be nice. Because this is getting ridiculous." [...] A top state Republican said, [...] "He <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> the attention. He {{seems to be going}} through some sort of catharsis in public. And we're like psychiatrists watching it. I can't quite figure it out. I don't think anybody can." [...] Clinton, meanwhile, said as little as possible about the situation, preferring to let Giuliani's drama play out on its own; on May 17, as he huddled with his doctors over whether to choose surgery or radiation as his treatment while facing conflicting political advice from his aides, she won the unanimous approval of delegates to the Democratic Party state convention at the Pepsi Arena in Albany, giving a constrained acceptance speech because she did not know her general election opponent.|$|E
500|$|Kurt and Blaine's duet on [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] {{received}} many more reviews {{than the other}} songs, and the greatest praise. Wieselman called it his [...] "far and away favorite" [...] song of the episode. Stack declared it the [...] "complete and total highlight of the episode {{and one of the}} best moments of the second season". He gave it an [...] "A+". Hankinson said it was the show's [...] "best musical number", and described it as [...] "well-performed, sweet and wonderfully choreographed"; he added: [...] "It was bold, without being gimmicky". The Atlantic Meghan Brown and Patrick Burns were both enthusiastic: Brown said [...] "Kurt's sweetly sexy duet with Blaine was near-perfect" [...] and [...] "the vocals and choreography gave Chris Colfer and Darren Criss a real chance to shine", while Burns called it [...] "adorable". Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote that it was [...] "full of sweet harmonies and has an ideal undercurrent of romantic tension", though Harper [...] "wasn't feeling any chemistry between them"; she felt the performance was [...] "a little overacted", but noted that [...] "their voices <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> each other". Benigno was also less enthusiastic; he gave the song a [...] "B−" [...] and felt there was [...] "something missing" [...] from the rendition: [...] "these two could have sang this number in their sleep and it kind of sounds like they did".|$|E
500|$|After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, {{spoke of}} plans to {{publicise}} Faryl in the US, saying [...] "America {{is going to}} be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense." [...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't think I would be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it is so difficult to make it over there ... They <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E

It ended up being almost minimal, but I remember there's so much shit we put on it. There's a psychedelic 12-string guitar solo, a backwards guitar, there's a kind of really cool synth that's in there but buried. At some point, you have to choose.

2500|$|It is {{revealed}} in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that Kingsley {{is one of the}} few wizards that the Dursleys <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>like,</b> due to his skill at blending in well with Muggles and his calm, collected demeanour. In that book, Kingsley first appears with other Order members to move Harry from the Dursleys' home to safety in the Burrow. Later in the book, he manages to send a timely warning to Bill and Fleur's wedding using his Patronus, a lynx, when Voldemort overthrows the Ministry of Magic, giving the guests a chance to escape. He continues to guard the Prime Minister, but is eventually forced to flee. He later is heard preaching equal rights for Muggles and Wizards on the pirate radio programme [...] "Potterwatch" [...] under the pseudonym [...] "Royal". In the Battle of Hogwarts he is first seen organising those who remained to fight. He is later seen dueling an unnamed Death Eater, and ends up duelling Voldemort himself, alongside Minerva McGonagall and Horace Slughorn, but after Bellatrix's death, Voldemort's anger erupts; Kingsley and the two others are defeated (although not killed). Kingsley is appointed temporary Minister for Magic following the death of Voldemort and the deposition of Voldemort's puppet ruler, Pius Thicknesse. However, it was later revealed by Rowling in an interview that Kingsley did become the new Minister permanently, revolutionising the Ministry itself.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the televised series, Andy makes appearances in Torchwood novels and audio dramas. He encounters Gwen again in the novel Another Life (set during series one) {{at the scene of}} Guy Wildman's death, and shows frustration at her evasive replies to his inquiries. In the novel Slow Decay, Rhys phones Andy after the attempted abduction of colleague Lucy Sobel and detects from Andy's handling of the situation that Andy does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> him, foreshadowing his later characterisation in the second series. The novel Trace Memory depicts a flashback of Gwen Cooper's first day partnered alongside him in the police force. Non-fiction tie-in The Torchwood Archives claims that Andy and Gwen were partners in the force for four years, prior to the events of [...] "Everything Changes" [...] and that during that time Andy never made a single criticism of her. [...] Andy also appears in the Torchwood audiobook In the Shadows, where he alerts Gwen to a mysterious case. Price provides voice acting for the Torchwood radio play [...] "Asylum" [...] in which Andy takes a personal interest in Freda, an Asylum seeker from the future. Andy has {{a central role in the}} 2012 audiobook Fallout, read by Tom Price and set after the conclusion of Miracle Day, where he must investigate alien technology in the absence of Gwen and Torchwood. A reviewer for the Ely Standard notes that the character's role has [...] "gradually expanded to the point whereby he can comfortably hold his own as lead character". Andy subsequently plays a large role in the audiobook Mr Invincible, also narrated by Price, where he joins forces with Captain Jack to investigate a number of time-related discrepancies in the Cardiff area.|$|E
