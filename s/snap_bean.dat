5|$|Helicoverpa zea {{has a wide}} host range, attacking {{vegetables}} that include corn, tomato, artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, cantaloupe, collards, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, lima bean, melon, okra, pea, pepper, potato, pumpkin, <b>snap</b> <b>bean,</b> spinach, squash, sweet potato, and watermelon. However, {{not all of these}} are good hosts. While corn and lettuce are shown to be great hosts, tomatoes are less beneficial, and broccoli and cantaloupe are poor hosts. Corn and sorghum are most favored by corn earworms. Various signs reveal the presence of these moths. Young maize crops have holes in their leaves, following whorl-feeding on the apical leaf. Eggs can be found on silks on larger plants, and silks display grazing evidence. The soft, milky grains in the top few centimeters of corn cobs are eaten as the corn ears develop. One larva per cob can be observed. Bore holes are observed in cabbage and lettuce hearts, flower heads, cotton bolls, and tomato fruits. Sorghum heads are grazed, and legume pod seeds are eaten.|$|E
500|$|In central Florida, the {{hurricane}} caused widespread damage to crops and properties. Damage to the grapefruit crop was heaviest {{in the region}} along the Indian River, where losses were expected to reach 30%. The orange crop was not as affected, and no area reported total losses at more than 5%. Losses to the citrus crop were considered better than initially anticipated. Overall, the citrus crop damage totaled about $3million, with 2.5million boxes destroyed. Additionally, {{the hurricane}} flooded about [...] of vegetable fields around Lake Okeechobee. Near Pompano, high winds and rain caused heavy losses to crops planted during early autumn, including snap beans, lima beans, cucumbers, eggplant, pepper, and squash; most of the crops required replanting. Elsewhere, the <b>snap</b> <b>bean</b> and sweet corn crops were severely damaged around the Everglades, and farms around Fort Pierce experienced heavy losses to the tomato crop.|$|E

Dry beans are divided into classes with a range of seed sizes, colors, and shapes. Examples include black beans, pintos, navy beans, small red beans, and kidney beans. Soybeans are usually divided into two groups, feed-grade and food-grade, with the food-grade including soybeans for processing, [...] "tofu-beans", and edamame, the latter of which is eaten as immature beans.|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} during 1992 and 1993 near Blairsville, GA t o determine {{the potential for}} using conservation tillage and cover crops {{in the production of}} <b>snap</b> <b>beans</b> in the Mountain region of Georgia.

A second experiment examined the need for sidedressed nitrogen for no-tillage and conventional tillage <b>snap</b> <b>beans</b> following a hairy vetch cover crop. The rye cover crop contained 30 and 95 Ibs N/acre, respectively, during 1992 and 1993, and hairy vetch contained 71 and 68 Ibs N/acre during the t w o years. There was a trend for increased inorganic N in the upper 12 " of soil following conventional tillage.

40|$|Common bean can {{be grown}} as a grain crop (dry beans) or as a fresh {{vegetable}} (<b>snap</b> beans/green <b>beans),</b> both items being important in nutritional terms for providing essential minerals and vitamins to the diet. <b>Snap</b> <b>beans</b> {{are thought to be}} derived predominantly from dry beans of the Andean genepool and to be of a recent European origin; however, the existence of Mesoamerican genepool characteristics especially in traditional indeterminate growth habit <b>snap</b> <b>beans</b> indicates a wider origin. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate genetic diversity within a set of 120 indeterminate (pole type) <b>snap</b> <b>beans</b> and 7 control genotypes representing each genepool using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat or microsatellite (SSR) markers. The genotypes were predominantly from Asia, Europe and the United States but included some varieties from Latin America and Africa. AFLP polymorphism ranged from 53. 2 to 67. 7 % while SSR polymorphism averaged 95. 3 % for the 32 fluorescent and 11 non-fluorescent markers evaluated and total expected heterozygosity was higher for SSR markers (0. 521) than for AFLP markers (0. 209). Both marker systems grouped the genotypes into two genepools with Andean and Mesoamerican controls, respectively, with the Mesoamerican group being predominant in terms of the number of genotypes assigned to this genepool. Phaseolin alleles were not tightly associated with genepool assignment indicating that introgression of this locus had occurred between the genepools, especially with phaseolin “S” in the Andean group (23. 5 %) and phaseolins “T” and “C” in the Mesoamerican group (12. 2 and 8. 2 %, respectively).

The main categories of common beans, {{on the basis of}} uses, are dry beans (seeds harvested at complete maturity), snap beans (tender pods with reduced fibre harvested before the seed development phase) and shell beans (seeds harvested at physiological maturity). Its leaf is also occasionally used as a vegetable and the straw as fodder.

After infection, small, water-soaked spots surrounded by a chlorotic halo appear on the leaves. The brown or black centers of these spots indicate that the tissue is dying. Typically these spots will enlarge and merge to form large, dead patches on the leaves. The leaves appear ragged if the dead tissue falls out. Lesions on pods are initially small and water-soaked but eventually enlarge, turn brown to black, and merge to encompass the whole pod. Infection can also occur on the stems, petioles and seeds.|$|E

40|$|Se cuantificó la variabilidad genética de una {{muestra de}} 116 accesiones de habichuela P. vulgaris, cultivadas en centros primarios y secundarios de domesticación. Se evaluaron 18 descriptores morfo-agronómicos asociados con características de la planta, vaina y semilla. Mediante el análisis de las faseolinas utilizando SDS-PAGE se encontraron patrones de bandas de origen andino (T, C y H 1) y mesoamericano [S, Sb, CH y H(S+I) ]. También se evaluaron ocho sistemas isoenzimáticos polimórficos. En el germoplasma de habichuela hay importante contribución del acervo mesoamericano y las accesiones en algunos centros secundarios de domesticación tuvieron origen y procesos de dispersión diferentes de los del fríjol común en tales zonas. La mayor variabilidad morfológica y el mayor número de accesiones con características deseables para el mercado fresco se encontró en el grupo mesoamericano. Se detectó mayor número de genotipos híbridos entre acervos cuando se utilizaron simultáneamente los tres descriptores, lo cual indica una estructura genética compleja que podría deberse al efecto de los factores ambientales propios de la zona templada sobre sus patrones reproductivos.
