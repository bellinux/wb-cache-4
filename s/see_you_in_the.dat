500|$|His final {{released}} {{movie was}} the Cult Indy Film, Night of the Templar, directed {{by his friend}} Paul Sampson, in which David wielded a sword (katana) for the final time on screen. Almost like a foreshadowing, there are several peculiar and eerie references in the film that are coincidental to Mr. Carradine's untimely passing which include cross dressing and auto erotic asphyxiation. His last scene on screen ended in the following dialog: [...] "Well, old friend, <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next lifetime" [...] / [...] "Yeah, Old Friends, Old Soul Mates" [...] / [...] "Yes, we are." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Worried? No, {{why should}} I have been? Lula Chandos and May Barclay had <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{automobile}} <b>in</b> town, and I {{knew you were}} high and dry somewhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Señor, you may count upon {{my small}} {{influence}} under all circumstances. I have <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day of trial, and it exceedeth ordinary misrepresentations to weaken {{my faith in}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some elderly millionaire, Alice," [...] Captain Bayley growled sarcastically, as they {{ascended the}} stairs, [...] "who has <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets, and wishes to lay {{himself and his}} fortune at your feet." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, {{following}} {{success on}} Wawffactor, Duffy recorded a three-song Welsh extended play, titled Aimée Duffy, while working part-time in two jobs as waitress {{and in a}} fishmonger's. It later achieved 2008 Welsh chart success, charting at number-one on the [...] "Siart C2" [...] music chart. Duffy, now in high demand, appeared on Mint Royale's <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Morning as a back-up singer. Duffy was introduced to Jeanette Lee of Rough Trade Records in August 2004, after singing Richard J. Parfitt's [...] "Oh Boy". Lee moved Duffy to Crouch End in London, orchestrating a meeting between Duffy and Suede's ex-guitar player Bernard Butler. Lee with Rough Trade would eventually manage Duffy. After Butler had given Duffy a soul music [...] "education" [...] by downloading tracks on to her iPod that she could listen to while around London or travelling back to Wales, the pair co-wrote with her and helped create a new retro sound. The music included tracks Al Green, Bettye Swann, Ann Peebles, Doris Duke, Scott Walker, Phil Spector and Burt Bacharach. Duffy {{was quoted as saying}} Bettye Swann [...] "is one of my biggest inspirations" [...] particularly her song [...] "Cover Me" [...] because [...] "it marks the time I got interested in physical contact. I was 19, and here was a woman singing 'Cover me, spread your precious love all over me.' It's very tender, but it's also, hilariously, quite crude." ...|$|E
60|$|Colonel Lawley. You drunken rascal, I'll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dock for this.|$|E
60|$|Hect. I pray you, let us <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field; We {{have had}} pelting wars, since you refused The Grecian cause.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{that will}} suit your complexion, you know, {{better than the}} old scarlet one. I know Mrs. Sharp will be more <b>in</b> love with <b>you</b> than ever when she <b>sees</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new one.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet why leave us, Colonel Howard? It is {{long since}} we have <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cloisters, and <b>you</b> know you come as a father; tarry, and you may yet add confessor to the title." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think I have <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> choir, {{and heard}} you too,' said the Bishop, kindly taking Lance's paw, {{which might have}} been cleaner, had he known what awaited it. 'Mr. Audley lives here, I think.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Just so," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "More {{than once}} I've <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{moonlight}} beside the Laughing Brook washing your food, {{and it has}} always pleased me, for {{there is nothing like}} cleanliness and neatness. Did you raise a family this year, Bobby?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Festing. [...] "I don't mean <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields. I've <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{afternoon}} when the sun's on the ripening corn {{and the leaves}} are dark and thick, but they stand for fulfilment, and that's not your proper setting. Once or twice I've stopped until evening, but you don't belong to the dusk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because I am {{surprised}} to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very last {{place where you}} ought to be, if you regard your safety,' observed Glossin, coolly.|$|E
6000|$|P.S.--I shall {{most likely}} <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{course of the}} summer, but, of [...] course, at such a distance, I cannot specify any {{particular}} month.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes! I {{remember}} your face now. I have often <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cricket field. Miss Pearson and myself are greatly indebted to you. I should not mind so much being robbed of my purse, but I prize my watch very highly {{as it was}} a present from my father. Major Horsley will <b>see</b> <b>you</b> and thank you when he hears what you have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her father, on his part, {{called out}} frankly, {{as he saw}} his friend's hesitation: [...] "Her lips, man--her lips! and that's a proffer I would not make to every one who crosses my threshold. But, by good St. Valentine, whose holyday will dawn tomorrow, I am so glad to <b>see</b> <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bonny city of Perth again {{that it would be}} hard to tell the thing I could refuse thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{would have}} had to tell it, sooner or later, Mrs. Westangle would; and she only told it to Miss Macroyd this {{afternoon}} on compulsion, after Miss Macroyd and I had <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wood-road, and Mrs. Westangle had to account for the young lady's presence there in your company. Then Miss Macroyd had to tell me; but I assure you, my dear fellow, the matter hasn't gone any further." ...|$|R

6000|$|MRS. HERRIOTT. (After {{conversation}} {{has risen}} to proper pitch.) Ah! 'Didn't <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crush in the drawing-room. (Sotto voce.) Where have you been all this while, Pip? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{outside for}} one moment," [...] he begged. [...] "I hate to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> place where that beast tried to lay hands upon you. Here is your necklace." ...|$|E
60|$|Trounce. But stay; {{for fear}} I shouldn't <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crowd, clap these {{little bits of}} ribbon into your hats.|$|R
6000|$|... "And hast thou come {{to claim}} {{me at the}} last," [...] she said, {{addressing}} Otter, [...] "O thou whose name is Darkness, to whom I was given in marriage, and from whom I fled when I was young? Do I <b>see</b> <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flesh, Lord of the night, King of blood and terror, and is this thy priest? Or do I but dream? Nay, I dream not; slay on, thou priest, and let my sin be purged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some {{sacrifice}} {{there must}} be. Give me time--give me time, I'll manage it. I only wish they hadn't <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bois." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Boy, good-bye. Mind the arch! Don't let Rufus bolt {{into his}} stables. Good-bye. Yes, I'll {{come down to}} dinner; but--what shall I do when I <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is Herman Mordaunt {{waiting to}} <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drawing-room. He asked {{particularly}} for you;--wishes to see you--expresses his regrets {{that you are}} not in, and talks only of you /" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It is we {{who have}} injured you, sir,” said Elizabeth; “and the {{knowledge}} that you decline our assistance would give my father great pain. He would gladly <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning.” ...|$|E
60|$|Dor. I <b>see</b> <b>you</b> are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> husband's fashion; <b>you</b> reserve {{all your}} good humours for your mistresses, {{and keep your}} ill for your wives.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had brought}} myself {{to believe you}} were taken into custody, Hiram! Job Lord was so certain the pass would not avail you, {{that it was almost}} the same as if I had <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{clutches}} of the lobster backs. You were cruel to leave us at such a time, simply to show that you could roam about the city at will, when the slightest mistake would have caused our chances for escaping with Silas to fall to the ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} keep you now," [...] the colonel said, [...] "for the mess-bugle sounded five minutes ago. I shall <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning." ...|$|R
