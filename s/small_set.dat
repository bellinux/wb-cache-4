5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} word planet, though it had yet to be defined, had become a working term applied only to a <b>small</b> <b>set</b> of objects in the Solar System. After 1992, however, astronomers began to {{discover}} many additional objects beyond the orbit of Neptune, as well as hundreds of objects orbiting other stars. These discoveries not only increased the number of potential planets, but also expanded their variety and peculiarity. Some were nearly large enough to be stars, while others were smaller than Earth's moon. These discoveries challenged long-perceived notions of what a planet could be.|$|E

5|$|In nonplanar surface embeddings {{the set of}} dual edges {{complementary}} to a {{spanning tree}} is not a dual spanning tree. Instead this set of edges is the union of a dual spanning tree with a <b>small</b> <b>set</b> of extra edges whose number {{is determined by the}} genus of the surface on which the graph is embedded. The extra edges, in combination with paths in the spanning trees, can be used to generate the fundamental group of the surface.|$|E
5|$|Metabolism {{involves}} {{a vast array}} of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a <b>small</b> <b>set</b> of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{theory of}} general {{state-space}} Markov chains can be {{strongly related to}} the case of discrete state-space by use of the notion of <b>small</b> <b>sets</b> and associated minorization conditions. The general theory shows that <b>small</b> <b>sets</b> exist for all Markov chains on state-spaces with countably generated σ-algebras, though the minorization provided by the theory concerns <b>small</b> <b>sets</b> of order n and n-step transition kernels for some unspecified n. Partly motivated by the growing importance of <b>small</b> <b>sets</b> for Markov chain Monte Carlo and Coupling from the Past, we show that in general there need be no <b>small</b> <b>sets</b> of order n= 1 even if the kernel is assumed to have a density function (though of course one can take n= 1 if the kernel density is continuous). However, n= 2 will suffice for kernels with densities (integral kernels), and in fact <b>small</b> <b>sets</b> of order 2 abound in the technical sense that the 2 -step kernel density can be expressed as a countable sum of non-negative separable summands based on <b>small</b> <b>sets.</b> This can be exploited to produce a representation using a latent discrete Markov chain; indeed one might say, inside every Markov chain with measurable transition density there is a discrete state-space Markov chain struggling to escape. We conclude by discussing complements to these results, including their relevance to Harris-recurrent Markov chains and we relate the counterexample to Turán problems for bipartite graphs...|$|R

5|$|Verbs are a {{class of}} word in Wagiman which {{contains}} fewer than 50 members. As it is a closed class, no more verbs are possible. They are often monosyllabic verb roots and all are vowel-final. Wagiman verbs obligatorily inflect for person and number of core arguments, and for the tense and aspect of the clause. A <b>small</b> <b>set</b> of verbs may take a non-finite suffix -yh, in which {{it may not be}} further inflected for person or tense. That non-finite verb must then co-occur with another auxiliary verb.|$|E
5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a <b>small</b> <b>set</b> of conserved genes.|$|E
