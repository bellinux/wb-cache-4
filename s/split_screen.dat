5|$|A {{total of}} eleven sets were created {{for all of}} the filming schedules. Filming also took place in Chengalpattu, Tiruvannamalai and Pondicherry. Spoofs on Sivaji Ganesan, M. G. Ramachandran and Avvaiyar are seen in the film. Wipes and <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> {{transitions}} are commonly used. Principal photography was completed in 5561 days.|$|E
5|$|As of February 2014, SteamOS, Valve's own Linux-based {{operating}} system, supports Portal 2 and its predecessor, as do {{most modern}} Debian-based Linux distributions on its services via the Steam client. Released as a Beta in early 2014 for Linux distributions, it holds {{all of the}} same traits as the other versions, retaining cross-platform play, <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> and fully native controller support.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons Games {{head-up display}} {{features}} health meters for both characters in each level, and an attack meter and special power meter {{for the character}} currently controlled by the player. The game features a two player co-op mode, which has a <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> and allows each player to control {{one of the two}} characters featured on that level.|$|E
50|$|This {{complexity}} {{is enhanced}} by Greaves's editing techniques, including <b>split</b> <b>screens</b> displaying two or even all three perspectives at once, but in simultaneous <b>split</b> <b>screens,</b> to further the use of simultaneous footage about the same sequence but from three different perspectives.|$|R
50|$|<b>Split</b> <b>screens</b> {{are also}} common in advertising, often to show comparison.|$|R
50|$|French {{director}} Georges Méliès incorporated {{special effects}} in his 1902 film Le Voyage dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon) — including double-exposure, <b>split</b> <b>screens,</b> miniatures and stop-action.|$|R
5|$|A 24-inch 1080p PlayStation branded 3D television, officially {{called the}} PlayStation 3D Display, was {{released}} in late 2011. A feature of this 3D television is SimulView. During multiplayer games, each player will only see their respective screen (in full HD) appear on the television through their respective 3D glasses, instead of seeing a <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> (e.g. player 1 will only see player 1's screen displayed through their 3D glasses).|$|E
5|$|Echoes also {{features}} a multiplayer mode that allows up to four players to engage in combat using a <b>split</b> <b>screen.</b> It has six arenas and two modes: Deathmatch, in which players attempt to kill their opponents {{as many times as}} possible within a set amount of time; and Bounty, which focuses on collecting coins that injured characters drop. Multiplayer in Echoes features the same control scheme as the single-player mode, including the lock-on system for circle strafing while targeting.|$|E
5|$|Pre-production {{began on}} October 5, 1997. In talks with investors, the {{directors}} presented an eight-minute documentary along with newspapers and news footage. The documentary was also aired on the defunct television series <b>Split</b> <b>Screen</b> hosted by John Pierson. The script {{began with a}} thirty-five page outline, with the dialogue to be improvised. Accordingly, the directors advertised in Backstage magazine for actors with strong improvisational abilities. There was a very informal improvisational audition process to narrow the pool of 2,000 actors.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{multiple}} video pages in hardware allowed double buffering, triple buffering or <b>split</b> <b>screens,</b> which, while available in VGA's 320×200 16-color mode, was not possible using stock Mode 13h.|$|R
5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of <b>split</b> <b>screens,</b> which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using <b>split</b> <b>screens</b> as an artistic element came into the series.|$|R
50|$|From the 1930s to the 1950s, montage {{sequences}} often combined numerous {{short shots}} with special optical effects (fades, dissolves, <b>split</b> <b>screens,</b> double and triple exposures) dance and music. They were usually assembled by {{someone other than}} the director or {{the editor of the}} movie.|$|R
5|$|Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was {{released}} for the Wii Virtual Console in September 2007 and Xbox Live Arcade on June 10, 2009. The Xbox version has enhanced graphics for high-definition, online leaderboards, support for multiplayer via <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> and Xbox Live, {{and a new}} saving system that allows progress to be saved anywhere during play. A PC version {{was released}} via Steam in January 2011, as Sonic 3 & Knuckles.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} a two-player mode that retains the single-player mechanics but {{is set in}} one of three specially designed stages and uses a vertically <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> to separate each player's view. Each player chooses one of the available charactersShadow, two metallic versions of him, and palette-swapped variants of each. The combatants attack each other and steal each other's rings until all but one are eliminated. Additionally, in single-player mode, a second player may take control of Shadow's sidekick character in some stages.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{went through}} 30 rewrites and four {{separate}} story changes before the BBC {{were satisfied with}} the plot. It would be rewritten again following the September 11 attacks, with the purpose of acknowledging the series premise as battling terrorism. Filming took place mostly in London, England using a long lens camera. The idea of using <b>split</b> <b>screen,</b> regularly used by the series, came from Nalluri after filming wrapped up for the episode, and was not inspired by the American television series 24.|$|E
50|$|Special {{effects were}} to be overseen by Cedric Gibbons and {{executed}} by M.G.M’s A. Arnold Gillespie and Warren Newcombe, James Basevi and Irving Reis. For its day {{it was to be}} complex, involving such devices as matte paintings, miniatures, <b>split</b> <b>screens,</b> and rear projection.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Split</b> <b>screens</b> are {{sometimes}} used during commercial breaks, as in ESPN's [...] "Side-By-Side" [...] coverage of racing, where {{one side of}} the screen shows race footage and the other shows advertising. This allows commercial to be shown while not interrupting coverage of race action.|$|R
50|$|Often, use of <b>split</b> <b>screens</b> or picture-in-pictures {{are used}} to show events {{occurring}} at the same time, or {{the context in which}} various subplots are affecting each other. Examples include the television series 24 and films Timecode and Phone Booth. On-screen clocks are often used to remind the audience of the real-time presentation.|$|R
5|$|The {{scene where}} the Pakistanis {{take control of}} the Indian {{submarine}} were archival footage taken from the BBC Motion Gallery. <b>Split</b> <b>screen</b> sequences were placed towards the end more {{than the rest of the}} episode to show the audience there is a bomb at the hotel with several police officers outside the building and Lucas and Ros looking around the hotel for Lawrence and Mudasser. The sequence where the hotel exploded was made through the medium of visual effects, produced by Darkside Animation.|$|E
5|$|During the screenwriting process when Ephron {{would not}} feel like writing, she would {{interview}} people {{who worked for the}} production company. Some of the interviews appeared in the film as the interludes between certain scenes featuring couples talking about how they met, although the material was rewritten and reshot with actors. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. For example, in the scene where Sally and Harry appear on a <b>split</b> <b>screen,</b> talking on the telephone while watching their respective television sets, channel surfing, was something that Crystal and Reiner did every night.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player mode, Seeds of Evil features a multiplayer mode where various players can compete {{against each other in}} several game types. Options such as time limit, map to play on, and characters to play as can be changed to match player preference. Every character has their own strengths and weaknesses, with some being able to regenerate health. For example, the Raptor is limited to close-range attacks, but is also extremely fast and agile. Multiplayer games in the Nintendo 64 version of the game support up to four players via <b>split</b> <b>screen.</b> In contrast, multiplayer games in the Microsoft Windows version support up to 16 players via LAN or internet.|$|E
50|$|The {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the Fox show 24. The episode includes many of the show's hallmarks, such as the multiple <b>split</b> <b>screens,</b> the timer before and after the commercial break, and extended opening credits running over the opening scenes of the narrative. 24 characters Jack Bauer and Chloe O'Brian, voiced by their original portrayers, make cameo appearances.|$|R
50|$|The film {{is based}} on the play Kind Sir by Norman Krasna. This was Grant's and Bergman's second film together, after Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious (1946), {{and was one of the}} first films to popularise artistic use of the {{technique}} of <b>split</b> <b>screens.</b> The film was remade for television in 1988 starring Robert Wagner and Lesley-Anne Down.|$|R
50|$|Man with a Movie Camera {{is famous}} for the range of {{cinematic}} techniques Vertov invents, deploys or develops, such as double exposure, fast motion, slow motion, freeze frames, jump cuts, <b>split</b> <b>screens,</b> Dutch angles, extreme close-ups, tracking shots, footage played backwards, stop motion animations and self-reflexive visuals (at one point it features a split-screen tracking shot; the sides have opposite Dutch angles).|$|R
5|$|In this episode, a Vidiian {{scientist}} named Sulan (Brian Markinson) captures and performs medical {{experiments on}} the half-Klingon, half-human B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson). He separates {{her into a}} full-blooded Klingon and a full-blooded human {{to find a cure}} for a disease. The Voyager crew rescues Torres and restores her to her original state, while she attempts to reconcile with her identity as a half-human half-Klingon. The episode guest stars Rob LaBelle as an unnamed Talaxian prisoner. Actress Joy Kilpatrick was cast as Dawson's photo double to avoid a reliance on <b>split</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jetpac Refuelled {{features}} a multiplayer mode {{that can be}} played either offline using a <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> or online via Xbox Live. In this mode, the player has to compete one-on-one in a race to build and refuel their craft before their opponent does. Fuel and rocket pickups can be stolen from opponents by shooting them or by using an EMP blast at close range. Lives are unlimited in multiplayer {{and the winner is}} determined by the highest score. A version of the original 1983 Jetpac is also included in the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Lemmings {{also has}} 20 two-player levels. This {{took advantage of}} the Amiga's ability to support two mice simultaneously, and the Atari's ability to support a mouse and a joystick simultaneously. Each player is presented with their own view of the same map (on a vertically <b>split</b> <b>screen),</b> can only give orders to their own lemmings (green or blue), and had their own base. The goal is to get more lemmings (regardless of colour) into one's own base than the other player. Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home.|$|E
50|$|MSX2 {{computers}} {{feature a}} dedicated Yamaha_V9938 Video Display Processor (VDP) that, like the NES, supports 'vertical blank interrupts' but requires polling for 'horizontal blank interrupts'. It was {{commonly used to}} create <b>split</b> <b>screens,</b> mix multiple video modes together on one screen and {{to increase the number}} of unique colours on the screen beyond the official spec. Prominent usage examples are the Aleste series and Konami's Space Manbow.|$|R
5000|$|Model {{animation}} {{refers to}} stop-motion animation created {{to interact with}} and exist {{as a part of}} a live-action world. Intercutting, matte effects and <b>split</b> <b>screens</b> are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings. Examples include the work of Ray Harryhausen, as seen in films, Jason and the Argonauts (1963), and the work of Willis H. O'Brien on films, King Kong (1933).|$|R
5000|$|New {{features}} include an optional sliding second row with [...] "Lounge Seating" [...] recliner style chairs, a feature previously {{seen on the}} Lexus LS, and Toyota's keyless Smart Key System with push-button start. The rear seat entertainment option now uses a 16.4 in LCD screen which operates in two view modes, a single 16:9-ratio widescreen or two separate 4:3-ratio <b>split</b> <b>screens</b> with separate wireless headphones.|$|R
5|$|The {{idea for}} split {{screening}} came to Nalluri after visiting a pub {{one night after}} filming wrapped up. In the audio commentary for the episode, Nalluri stated he was not inspired by the American series 24, which also uses <b>split</b> <b>screen,</b> as he was not yet aware of the show. The news report covering Mary and Paul Kane's past activities were snippets of real-life news from the United States, which were edited together. The music was composed by Jennie Muskett, who spent just {{two to three hours}} putting several pieces of background music together. One part of the episode centred on Zoe posing as target Diane Sullivan. Some publicity shots of Keeley Hawes in the series were shots of her with long brunette hair, though in fact she has short blonde hair.|$|E
5|$|Doink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow {{throughout}} October and November {{with such}} pranks as throwing water and confetti {{on him and}} dumping a pail of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon. He also tied a tripwire across the aisle during one of Bigelow's matches; after Bigelow fell over the wire, Doink attacked him with a broom. Bigelow responded by coming to the ring during one of Doink's matches and destroying Doink's toy wagon. The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers, who occasionally appeared at the same time. The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger, who portrayed an overweight and dirty glutton, and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages, to face four Doinks. To promote the match, Doink appeared on the video wall {{that was part of}} the set during Bigelow's matches leading up to the event. The wall used a <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> to show multiple Doinks talking and laughing at the same time.|$|E
5|$|In Chocobo Racing, {{the player}} {{controls}} Final Fantasy-inspired characters, {{most of whom}} race in go-karts. Other characters fly, drive scooters, ride magic carpets, or even run. Players have five different racing modes to choose from: Story Mode, Versus Mode, Grand Prix, Relay Race, and Time Attack. In the Story Mode, players are guided through the story of Chocobo Racing, which is narrated by Cid, {{in the form of}} an onscreen version of a pop-up book. Players who complete the Story Mode are given the chance to customize their own racer; completing the Story Mode also unlocks secret character racers. In the Versus Mode, two players can race each other on a horizontally <b>split</b> <b>screen,</b> where one player races viewing the top half of the screen and the other player races viewing the bottom half. In Grand Prix (GP) Mode, the player races computer-controlled opponents in four selected tracks of his or her choice. In Relay Race Mode, the player chooses three racers to compete in a relay match. In Time Attack Mode, the player can select any stage and try to beat the fastest time record set there. There are ten track options: Cid's Test Track, Moogle Forest, The Ancient Gate, Mythril Mines, The Black Manor, Floating Gardens, Gingerbread Land, Vulcan-O Valley, Fantasia, and F.F.VIII Circuit.|$|E
5000|$|The visionary French director, Abel Gance, {{used the}} term [...] "Polyvision" [...] to {{describe}} his three-camera, three-projector technique for both widening and dividing the screen in his 1927 silent epic, Napoléon. The filmmaker Brian De Palma has incorporated <b>split</b> <b>screens</b> into many of his films, most notably in Sisters (1973) and they have since become synonymous with his filmmaking style (Specifically 1981's Blow Out and 1998's Snake Eyes).|$|R
50|$|Both {{of these}} styles of montage have {{fallen out of}} favor in the last 50 years. Today's montages avoid the use of {{multiple}} images in one shot, either through <b>splits</b> <b>screens</b> as in the first example or layering multiple images as in the second. Most recent examples use a simpler sequence of individual short, rapidly paced shots combined with a specially created background song to enhance the mood or reinforce the message being conveyed.|$|R
50|$|Snake Eyes is a 1998 American {{conspiracy}} thriller film {{directed by}} Brian De Palma, featuring his trademark use of long tracking shots and <b>split</b> <b>screens.</b> It starred Nicolas Cage, Gary Sinise and Carla Gugino. The film {{was written by}} David Koepp and De Palma, and was released to theaters on August 7, 1998. It costed an estimated $73 million to produce and returned $103 million worldwide, but received mixed to negative reviews from critics.|$|R
