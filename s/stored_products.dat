Urban forensic entomology studies may also indicate the appropriateness of certain pesticide treatments and may also be used in <b>stored</b> <b>products</b> cases where it can help to determine chain of custody, when all points of possible infestation are examined in order to determine who is at fault.|$|E

40|$|Stored product insects feed on {{grains and}} {{processed}} commodities manufactured from grain post-harvest, reducing the nutritional value and contaminating food. Currently, the main defense against <b>stored</b> <b>product</b> insect pests is the pesticide fumigant phosphine. Phosphine is highly toxic to all animals, {{but is the}} most effective and economical control method, and thus is used extensively worldwide. However, many insect populations have become resistant to phosphine, in some cases to very high levels. New, environmentally benign and more effective control strategies are needed for <b>stored</b> <b>product</b> pests. RNA interference (RNAi) may overcome pesticide resistance by targeting the expression of genes that contribute to resistance in insects. Most data on RNAi in <b>stored</b> <b>product</b> insects is from the coleopteran genetic model, Tribolium castaneum, since it has a strong RNAi response via injection of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) in any life stage. Additionally, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) technology has been suggested as a potential resource for new pest control strategies. In this review we discuss background information on both gene disruption technologies and summarize the advances made in terms of molecular pest management in <b>stored</b> <b>product</b> insects, mainly T. castaneum, as well as complications and future needs...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} is aimed to {{evaluate}} the potential use of the known isothyiocyanates, as compared to a new isothyiocyanate (ITC) isolated from Eruca sativa (salad rocket) as fumigants for the control of <b>stored</b> <b>product</b> insects. The biological activity of methyl iodide (CH 3 I), carbon disulphide (CS 2), benzaldehyde (C 7 H 6 O) and essential oils were also evaluated. The toxicity of the various fumigants was assessed against adults and larvae {{of a number of}} major <b>stored</b> <b>product</b> insects. ITCs are known to have high toxicity and only very low concentrations are needed for the control of <b>stored</b> <b>product</b> insects. Eruca sativa is used worldwide as a food supplement. Methylthio butyl ITC, the main bioactive component in this plant has high toxicity against insects, but lower mammalian toxicity as compared to other active ITCs. This makes this compound a potential candidate for insect control. Comparative studies with CH 3 I, CS 2 and C 7 H 6 O showed that the first was the most active compound against <b>stored</b> <b>product</b> insects followed by the second and third. C 7 H 6 O was found active, but very sorptive; therefore it was less effective against insects. The activity {{of a large number of}} essential oils (EOs) isolated from aromatic plants was also evaluated...|$|R

50|$|These booklice mainly attack grain stores. They reduce {{weight and}} quality, invade {{packaged}} foodstuffs, and infest storage facilities.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of plant {{extracts}} have been used alternatively to chemical insecticides against <b>stored</b> <b>product</b> insect pest species. These substances could be used alone or {{in combination with other}} alternatives or synthetic insecticides in order to enhance their action. Botanicals can be applied with the same techniques that are used for the application of traditional contact insecticides or fumigants. Given that <b>stored</b> <b>product</b> insects exhibit different levels of sensitivity or tolerance to plant extracts, a wide screening of these substances has been carried out to widen the available tools against these harmful organisms with interesting results. © 2014 Springer India.
