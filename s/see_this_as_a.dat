25|$|The current {{population}} numbers about 2,400 and the tribe has closed the rolls. They have dropped some {{people from the}} rolls and denied new applications for membership.

25|$|In {{the tenth}} century, the Karluks, Yagmas, Chigils and other Turkic tribes founded the Kara-Khanid Khanate in Semirechye, Western Tian Shan, and Kashgaria, and later conquered Transoxiana. The Karakhanid rulers {{were likely to}} be Yaghmas who were {{associated}} with the Toquz Oghuz, and some historians therefore <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> link between the Karakhanid and the Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate, although this connection is disputed by others.|$|E

25|$|Many reviewers {{and critics}} regard Archie Goodwin {{as the true}} protagonist of the Nero Wolfe corpus. Compared to Wolfe, Archie is the man of action, tough and street smart. His {{narrative}} style is breezy and vivid. Some commentators <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> conscious device by Stout to fuse the hard school of Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade with the urbanity of Sherlock Holmes or Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot. But {{there is no doubt}} that Archie was an important addition to the genre of detective fiction. Previously, foils such as Dr. Watson or Arthur Hastings were employed as confidants and narrators, but none had such a fully developed personality or was such an integral part of the plot as Archie.|$|E
25|$|Though both {{manufacturers}} {{have a broad}} product range in various segments from single-aisle to wide-body, their aircraft do not always compete head-to-head. Instead they respond with models slightly smaller or bigger than the other in order to plug any holes in demand and achieve a better edge. The A380, for example, {{is designed to be}} larger than the 747. The A350XWB competes with {{the high end of the}} 787 and the low end of the 777. The A320 is bigger than the 737-700 but smaller than the 737–800. The A321 is bigger than the 737–900 but smaller than the previous 757-200. Airlines <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> benefit since they get a more complete product range, from 100 seats to 500 seats, than if both companies offered identical aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The city is {{surrounded}} on four sides by the Judean Desert and {{is linked to}} Jerusalem and the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area via Highway 1. Due to its strategic location between {{the northern and southern}} parts of the West Bank, Palestinians <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> threat to the territorial continuity of a future Palestinian state. This claim is disputed by mayor Benny Kashriel, who claims that continuity would be attained by circling Ma'ale Adumim to the east. Israeli drivers use a bypass road that exits the city to the west, entering Jerusalem through the French Hill Junction or a tunnel that goes under Mt. Scopus. These routes were built {{in the wake of the}} First and Second Intifadas when Palestinian militants shot at motorists and cars were stoned. The previous road passed through al-Eizariya and Abu Dis.|$|E

25|$|The left portal is more enigmatic and {{art historians}} still argue over the correct identification. The {{tympanum}} shows Christ {{standing on a}} cloud, apparently supported by two angels. Some <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> depiction of the Ascension of Christ (in which case the figures on the lower lintel would represent the disciples witnessing the event) while others see it as representing the Parousia, or Second Coming of Christ (in which case the lintel figures could be either the prophets who foresaw that event or else the 'Men of Galilee' mentioned in Acts 1:9-11). The presence of angels in the upper lintel, descending from a cloud and apparently shouting to those below, would seem to support the latter interpretation. The archivolts contain {{the signs of the}} zodiac and the labours of the months – standard references to the cyclical nature of time which appear in many gothic portals.|$|E
25|$|Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans (or CRs) often {{celebrate}} Samhain on {{the date}} of first frost, or when {{the last of the}} harvest is in and the ground is dry enough to have a bonfire. Some follow the old tradition of building two bonfires, which celebrants and livestock then walk or dance between as a ritual of purification. For CRs, it is a time when the dead are especially honoured. Though CRs make offerings at all times of the year, Samhain is a time when more elaborate offerings are made to specific ancestors. This may involve making a small shrine. Often there will be a meal, where a place for the dead is set at the table and they are invited to join. Traditional tales may be told and traditional songs, poems and dances performed. A western-facing door or window may be opened and a candle left burning on the windowsill to guide the dead home. Divination for the coming year is often done, whether in all solemnity or as games for the children. The more mystically inclined may also <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> time for deeply communing with their deities, especially those seen as being particularly linked with this festival.|$|E
500|$|Because non-reductive physicalist {{theories}} {{attempt to}} both retain the ontological distinction between {{mind and body}} {{and to try to}} solve the [...] "surfeit of explanations puzzle" [...] in some way; critics often <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> paradox and point out the similarities to epiphenomenalism, in that it is the brain that is seen as the root [...] "cause" [...] not the mind, and the mind seems to be rendered inert.|$|E

500|$|Much of folk {{psychology}} {{involves the}} attribution of intentional states (or more specifically as a subclass, propositional attitudes). Eliminativists {{point out that}} these states are generally ascribed syntactic and semantic properties. An {{example of this is}} the language of thought hypothesis, which attributes a discrete, combinatorial syntax and other linguistic properties to these mental phenomena. Eliminativists argue that such discrete and combinatorial characteristics have no place in the neurosciences, which speak of action potentials, spiking frequencies, and other effects which are continuous and distributed in nature. Hence, the syntactic structures which are assumed by folk psychology can have no place in such a structure as the brain. Against this there have been two responses. On the one hand, there are philosophers who deny that mental states are linguistic in nature and <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> straw man argument. The other view is represented by those who subscribe to [...] "a language of thought". They assert that the mental states can be multiply realized and that functional characterizations are just higher-level characterizations of what's happening at the physical level.|$|E

UGO named the episode's main antagonist {{as one of the greatest}} [...] "Top 11 X-Files Monsters," [...] noting that the creature is a [...] "perfect [...] if only because the monster in question is a living, breathing metaphor, a never-seen specter that shifts to fit the fears of the person witnessing it." [...] Narin Bahar from SFX named the episode one of the [...] "Best Sci-Fi TV Mockumentaries" [...] and wrote, [...] "Whether you <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> brilliantly post-modern merging of fact and fiction or shameless cross-promotion of two of the Fox Network's biggest TV shows, there's lots of nods to the real Cops show in this episode". Bahar praised the scene featuring the terrified lady telling Mulder that Freddy Krueger attacked her—calling the scene the [...] "best in-joke"—and applauded the two series' cohesion.|$|E
500|$|Beatty had {{realized}} several {{positive aspects of}} hiring Madonna as an actress for the film. She would be inclined to develop the soundtrack for Dick Tracy and the film studio would <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> promotional opportunity before the release of their product, since Madonna was popular as a recording artist. This would also benefit Warner Bros. Records, who would get a reason to release a new Madonna record. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , by the 1980s record labels started to release albums which were closely associated with a film, thereby gaining double promotion. These were mostly termed as soundtracks although {{many of them were}} not related to the film. After the shooting for Dick Tracy was over, Madonna started working on the soundtrack. She had begun recording three songs by Stephen Sondheim for the film—"Sooner or Later", [...] "More" [...] and [...] "What Can You Lose"—which would be part of the album, but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to the previous. In her favor, she produced the entire album, including the Sondheim songs. [...] "I want people to think of me as a musical comedy actress. That's what this album is about for me. It's a stretch. Not just pop music, but songs that have a different feel to them, a theatrical feel", she said at the time.|$|E
