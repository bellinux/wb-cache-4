He was noted for six assists, which placed him third in the assist-table and which made him the defender with the most assists of the 2014–15 season – despite playing {{less than half of the}} games. Defensively Copenhagen only conceded goals in six games, with many experts {{claiming}} that he was one of the best players of the <b>spring</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April, Nocentini rode to tenth {{place at}} the GP Miguel Indurain, and Roche did {{likewise}} at Paris–Camembert, as did Goddaert in Tro-Bro Léon.

Kišerlovski and Clarke took seventh places at two early-season classics, respectively the Classica Sarda and the Giro del Friuli, the latter a race run in such difficult conditions that only 25 riders finished.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{off-season}} {{marred by}} financial difficulties {{that resulted in}} wage cuts {{for a number of}} riders, the 2005 <b>spring</b> <b>season</b> was the strongest yet for CSC, with wins by Julich and Jens Voigt. Julich's victory in Paris–Nice made him the first rider to wear the leader's jersey in the new UCI ProTour. This was followed by three team stage wins in the Giro d'Italia, one by David Zabriskie and two by Basso, though the overall victory escaped from Basso when he was beset by a stomach ailment.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{presence}} at other single-day {{races in the}} <b>spring</b> <b>season</b> was paltry. Only two other races featured top-ten finishes from the team. Txurruka took seventh at the Klasika Primavera, finishing staunchly {{in the middle of}} a 15-man sprint at the finish. Antón similarly made all the day's selections and finished 11th in this group, as he built his form for the Giro d'Italia.

5|$|Though often {{considered}} to be a team with a strong classics pedigree, and active in most races with several top tens, they did not win any single-day race in the <b>spring</b> <b>season.</b> Greg Van Avermaet won the late-season Paris–Tours, along with two stages in stage races earlier in the season. The team's ostensible classics leader, Italian Alessandro Ballan, did not win any race in 2011 and was again briefly suspended from racing pursuant to the ongoing Mantova doping investigation, as he had been in 2010.|$|E
5|$|By {{their own}} admission, Astana does not {{aim for the}} classics. The team first participated in Omloop Het Volk on March 1, with Dmitriy Muravyev in 31st their best-placed rider. Sergei Ivanov's 7th in the Amstel Gold Race proved {{to be one of}} the team's best results all season, as in the other spring races in which they competed, Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, the Tour of Flanders, and Gent–Wevelgem, they did not have a rider place higher than 13th. Due in part to the ban imposed by the Amaury Sport Organisation from {{participating}} in races they organized, the team did not compete in Milan–San Remo, Paris–Roubaix, La Flèche Wallonne, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, or other races in which a team of their caliber would normally take part. In March, Tomas Vaitkus earned the team's lone one-day victory of the <b>spring</b> <b>season,</b> winning a sprint finish to the Ronde van het Groene Hart.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>spring</b> <b>season</b> of 1975, the Vietnam People's Army High Command in Hanoi {{made the}} {{decision}} to seize the major South Vietnamese cities of Huế and Da Nang, and also destroy the various South Vietnamese units in I Corps Tactical Zone, led by ARVN General Ngô Quang Trưởng. Originally, the campaign was planned to take place over two phases; during the seasons of spring-summer and autumn. However, as the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces rolled over South Vietnamese defences on the outskirts of Huế and Da Nang, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu ordered General Trưởng to abandon all territories under his control, and pull his forces back to the coastal areas of I Corps. However, the South Vietnamese withdrawal quickly turned into a rout, as the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps picked off one South Vietnamese unit after another, until Huế and Da Nang was completely surrounded. By March 29, 1975, North Vietnamese troops had full control of Huế and Da Nang, while South Vietnam lost all territories in I Corps and most of the units belonging to the ARVN 1st Brigade.|$|E

He began the season claiming his fourth silverware with Bordeaux on 25 July 2009, winning the 2009 Trophée des Champions title in a 2–0 victory over Guingamp. In the third match of the league, Diarra scored his first goal {{of the season in}} a 3–0 win over Nice. Diarra appeared frequently in the starting lineup {{during the first half of}} the campaign, but struggled with injuries through January–March. He missed the first leg of the team's Round of 16 tie with Greek club Olympiacos. In the second leg, Diarra returned to the team, but was ejected from the match in the second half after receiving two yellow card infractions. The ejection meant Diarra would miss the first leg of the team's quarter-final tie with league rivals Lyon. Bordeaux lost the tie 3–2 on aggregate. Diarra returned to league play on 13 March 2010 and played the rest of the league campaign missing only one match. Due to injuries to Gourcuff and the declining form of Marouane Chamakh, Bordeaux suffered a dip in form in the <b>spring</b> <b>season,</b> which resulted in Bordeaux failing defend its title or qualify for European competition.|$|E
