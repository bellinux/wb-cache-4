2500|$|Overall, the {{construction}} {{took more than}} two years. [...] Structural work was completed in July 1908, and the first test swing of the center span was accomplished by a tugboat pushing on it, as the heavy machinery for that purpose {{had yet to be}} installed. Problems with the <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> of parts of the machinery for turning this world's-longest swing span caused a delay of a few months, and not until October was the span turned for the first time under its own power. The first train crossed on October 23, 1908, and the bridge opened for regular use in November. [...] The Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway's first scheduled passenger train on the new line into and out of Portland operated on November 17, 1908, and the terminus in Portland was the North Bank Depot on N.W. Hoyt Street at 11th Avenue, rather than Union Station. [...] SP service moved to Union Station in 1922.|$|E

25|$|Hood {{conducted}} {{the remainder of}} the Atlanta Campaign with the strong aggressive actions for which he had become famous. He launched four major attacks that summer in an attempt to break Sherman's siege of Atlanta, starting almost immediately with an attack along Peachtree Creek.

All of the offensives failed, particularly at the Battle of Ezra Church, with significant Confederate casualties. Finally, on September 2, 1864, Hood evacuated the city of Atlanta, burning as many military <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>installations</b> as possible.|$|R

25|$|Just {{before the}} Battle of Peachtree Creek (July 20) in the {{outskirts}} of Atlanta, Jefferson Davis lost patience with Johnston's strategy and, fearing that Johnston would give up Atlanta without a battle, replaced him with the more aggressive Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood. Over the next six weeks, Hood would repeatedly attempt to attack a portion of Sherman's force which seemed isolated from the main body; each attack failed, often with heavy casualties for the Confederate army. Sherman eventually cut Hood's supply lines from the south. Knowing that he was trapped, Hood evacuated Atlanta {{on the night of}} September 1, burning military <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>installations,</b> causing a great conflagration in the city.|$|R
