The set contained 329 terms for Patient Problems, 308 terms for Patient Outcomes, and 1261 terms for Patient Care Actions. Six of the hospitals participated in a test of validity and reliability of the <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> and codes. Manual audits were conducted on 465 patient records from two services in each hospital. All auditors achieved acceptable accuracy in coding. The auditors identified 18, 995 items in the patient records as representing statements of Patient Problems, Patient Outcomes, or Patient Care Actions. The <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> and codes matched 99. 1 % of these items.

Failure of business and consumer groups to agree on this issue derailed revisions to the Uniform Commercial Code in 1999 {{and contributed to the}} creation of a separate law for electronic commerce, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act. United States Internet licenses are subject to foreign <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> laws. In 1993 the European Union adopted the Unfair Terms Directive, which was inspired by the German <b>Standard</b> <b>Terms</b> Statute of 1976. European laws are much more rigorous than their American counterparts. Typical license terms used domestically by American Internet companies such as AOL and Microsoft are prohibited in Europe. American legal scholarship has largely ignored foreign <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> laws.

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} {{to one of the}} important terms o f the consumer law i. e. <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> in consumer contracts, which in Polish civil law is functioning as “wzorzec umowy konsumenckiej”. In order to propose its definition, the author analysed the civil code provisions regulating the institution of <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> (art. 384), the unfair terms in consumer contracts (art. and the provisions of the Council Directive 93 / 13 /EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts. Based on the institution of <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> in consumer contracts, three major issues have been flagged out: 1) the content of <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> in consumer contracts; 2) the manner of their edition; 3) the medium of transfer. It has been concluded that only the content of the <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> in consumer contracts is controlled by the institution of unfair terms in consumer contracts (art. 385 '- 3853 k. c.). In the author’s opinion the Civil Code has introduced the principle of freedom in regard to the way both of edition (art. 384) and the type of the transfer media (art. 60). Further, the author states that the term “standard terms in consumer contracts” is a declaration of will made by the entrepreneur, or the enterprise, regulating mass goods within the scope of his specific, professional business activity. <b>Standard</b> <b>terms</b> in consumer contracts are formulated in order to make an unlimited number of contracts with an unlimited number of consumers and that is why they do not contain provisions defining an individual consumer or the subject of a given contract...|$|R

40|$|Incorporation of <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> is a much-debated {{issue in}} almost all legal systems. Any legal {{instrument}} on contract law therefore must provide an answer as to when terms are incorporated – but answers may vary considerably from one legal system to the next. In this chapter {{the provisions of the}} – now withdrawn – proposal for a Common European Sales Law pertaining to the incorporation of <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> will be compared to the incorporation rules in German and Dutch law. The term ‘incorporation rules’ will be used in a rather broad sense and include rules pertaining to the acceptance of <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> imposed on the other party, to rules pertaining to surprising and unclear terms, and to rules requiring the party imposing the terms to give the other party a reasonable opportunity to become aware of their content. The focus will therefore be on Article 70 of the CESL and its functional equivalents in German and Dutch law. It is hoped that the European legislator may benefit from this analysis when developing rules on incorporation of <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> for upcoming legal instruments, such as an instrument for the Digital Single Market...|$|R

The CESL contains an express provision concerning the incorporation of <b>standard</b> <b>terms,</b> but one may wonder what to conclude from this provision concerning B 2 B transactions. Concerning {{the battle of the}} forms, there is legal uncertainty in the application of the CISG as it is not clear from the text of the CISG and from the legal literature which approach should be followed. The provision in the CESL on this topic is rather clear as it provides which theory should be followed. However how, in practice, cases should be solved is not yet fully clear...|$|R

25|$|Because of the {{controversy}} over Westropp's Mesolithic and Mortillet's Gap beginning in 1872 archaeological attention focused mainly on the revolution at the Palaeolithic—Neolithic boundary as {{an explanation of the}} gap. For a few decades the Neolithic Period, as it was called, was described as a kind of revolution. In the 1890s, a <b>standard</b> <b>term,</b> the Neolithic Revolution, began to appear in encyclopedias such as Pears. In 1925 the Cambridge Ancient History reported:There are quite a large number of archaeologists who justifiably consider the period of the Late Stone Age to be a neolithic revolution and an economic revolution at the same time. For that is the period when primitive agriculture developed and cattle breeding began.|$|E

40|$|The problem {{dealing with}} the {{inclusion}} of <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> and conditions in contracts {{is a problem that}} has engaged most legal systems. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, Vienna 1980 (CISG) does not expressly deal with this problem. Accordingly the solution to the issue must be found in an interpretation and application of the general principles found in articles 8, 14 and 18. One of the main objects of the CISG is the harmonisation of international trade law. It is generally recognised that in order to achieve harmonisation it is necessary that courts should interpret and apply the convention in a consistent and harmonious manner. Unfortunately a number of approaches have emerged from courts around the world in regard to the inclusion of <b>standard</b> <b>terms.</b> German courts have developed a strict approach which requires that the <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> be made available to the addressee {{at the time of the}} conclusion of the contract. They also require that the <b>standard</b> <b>terms</b> be couched in the language of the main contract. In stark contrast an American court has used an approach which is very lax in regard to incorporation, even allowing incorporation after the conclusion of the contract. There is, however a more moderate approach set out in decisions of the Austrian Supreme Court where the court adopted an approach which is more akin to that found in most legal systems, namely that a clear incorporation clause in the contract is sufficient for the effective incorporation of <b>standard</b> <b>terms.</b> The author critically examines the case law, the various approaches and the underlying arguments on which they are based, before reaching the conclusion that the two extreme approaches should be rejected in favour of the more moderate approach. This approach is founded on a proper interpretation of the provisions of the CISG as well as being in step with international trade practice...|$|R
