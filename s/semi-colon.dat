This use of swearwords differs in that it serves a {{grammatical}} purpose in a sentence. Rarely, some sacres will be used like a question mark, <b>semi-colon,</b> or even as a colon.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, {{despite the}} risk to his livelihood, he defended runaway slaves and those tried for {{assisting}} them. He became particularly devoted to {{the abolition of slavery}} from the death of his first wife, Katherine Jane Garmiss, in 1835, shortly after their March 1834 wedding, an event which was a spiritual reawakening for him. He worked initially with the American Sunday School Union. At a time when public opinion in Cincinnati was dominated by Southern business connections, Chase, influenced by local events, including the attack on the press of JamesG. Birney during the Cincinnati Riots of 1836, associated himself with the anti-slavery movement. Chase was {{also a member of the}} literary <b>Semi-Colon</b> Club; its members included Harriet Beecher Stowe and Calvin Stowe. Chase became the leader of the political reformers, as opposed to the Garrisonian abolitionist movement.|$|E

2500|$|An {{attribute}} is a markup construct {{consisting of}} a name–value pair that exists within a start-tag or empty-element tag. An example is <img src="madonna.jpg" [...] alt="Madonna" [...] />, where {{the names of the}} attributes are [...] "src" [...] and [...] "alt", and their values are [...] "madonna.jpg" [...] and [...] "Madonna" [...] respectively. Another example is <step number="3">Connect A to B.</step>, where the name of the attribute is [...] "number" [...] and its value is [...] "3". An XML attribute can only have a single value and each attribute can appear at most once on each element. In the common situation where a list of multiple values is desired, this must be done by encoding the list into a well-formed XML attribute with some format beyond what XML defines itself. Usually this is either a comma or <b>semi-colon</b> delimited list or, if the individual values are known not to contain spaces, a space-delimited list can be used. <div class="inner greeting-box">Welcome!</div>, where the attribute [...] "class" [...] has both the value [...] "inner greeting-box" [...] and also indicates the two CSS class names [...] "inner" [...] and [...] "greeting-box".|$|E

500|$|Each COBOL {{program is}} made up of four basic lexical items: words, literals, picture character-strings (see [...] ) and separators. Words include {{reserved}} words and user-defined identifiers. They are up to 31 characters long and may include letters, digits, hyphens and underscores. Literals include numerals (e.g. [...] ) and strings (e.g. [...] ). Separators include the space character and commas and <b>semi-colons</b> followed by a space.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on {{the data}} itself, it may be {{beneficial}} to use non-standard characters such as the tilde (~) as delimiters. With rising prevalence of web sites and other applications that store snippets of code in databases, simply using a [...] " [...] which occurs in every hyperlink and image source tag simply isn't sufficient to avoid this type of collision. Since colons (:), <b>semi-colons</b> ( [...] ;), pipes (|), and many other characters are also used, it can be quite challenging to find a character that isn't being used elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|Starting with Pastors and Masters (1925), Compton-Burnett {{developed}} a highly individualistic style.

6000|$|He {{wanted us}} to believe that all things, his poetry with its Latin weight, his {{religion}} with its constant reference to the Fathers of the Church, or to the philosophers of the Church, almost his very courtesy were a study and achievement of the intellect. Arthur Symons' poetry made him angry, because it would substitute for that achievement, Parisian impressionism, [...] "a London fog, the blurred tawny lamplight, the red omnibus, the dreary rain, the depressing mud, the glaring gin shop, the slatternly shivering women, three dexterous stanzas telling you that and nothing more." [...] I, on the other hand, angered him by talking as if art existed for emotion only, and for refutation he would quote the close of the Aeschylean Trilogy, the trial of Orestes on the Acropolis. Yet at moments the thought came to him that intellect, as he conceived it, was too much a thing of many books, that it lacked lively experience. [...] "Yeats," [...] he has said to me, [...] "You need ten years in a library, but I have need of ten years in the wilderness." [...] When he said [...] "Wilderness" [...] I am certain, however, that he thought of some historical, some bookish desert, the Thebaid, or the lands about the Mareotic sea. His best poetry is natural and impassioned, but he spoke little of it, but much about his prose, and would contend that I had no right to consider words made to read, less natural than words made to be spoken; and he delighted in a sentence in his book on Thomas Hardy, that kept its vitality, as he contended, though two pages long. He punctuated after the manner of the seventeenth century and was always ready to spend an hour discussing the exact use of the colon. [...] "One should use a colon where other people use a <b>semi-colon,</b> a <b>semi-colon</b> where other people use a comma," [...] was, I think, but a condescension to my ignorance for the matter was plainly beset with many subtleties.|$|E

50|$|The poem {{consists}} of 73 stanzas, each with four lines of fifteen syllables, {{for a total}} of 292 lines. It is written in Lombardic metre, which was traditionally used in Italy for historical poems and dirges, and which comprises rhyming trochaic tetrameters. In the surviving copy the rhyming is imperfect and the metre frequently fails. The author or copyist used a symbol resembling a small closing parenthesis above a dot to indicate the tetrameters and the end of every line, and a period to indicate the end of a stanza. In modern editions these may be replaced by commas, <b>semi-colons,</b> colons or exclamation marks where thought appropriate by the editor.|$|R

The mother frets about her daughter maturing into a woman, reflective of Jamaica Kincaid’s own experiences growing up with her forceful mother in Antigua. The structure consists of a single sentence, punctuated by <b>semi-colons,</b> detailing the advice imparted from mother to daughter. The mother’s voice is predominant in the narrative, only interrupted twice by the daughter who makes a feigned attempt to defend herself.|$|R
