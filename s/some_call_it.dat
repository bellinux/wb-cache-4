5|$|In December, {{the deputies}} {{of the other}} provinces convened by the {{circular}} of May 27 arrived to Buenos Aires. Most of them were closer to the ideas of Saavedra, and Gregorio Funes became highly influential over them. They did not agree about which body they should join: the deputies wanted to join the Junta, while Moreno thought that they should start a constituent assembly. Funes, allied with Saavedra, calculated that they could stop Moreno by joining the Junta, as his proposals would be agreed to by a minority. The Junta, with both its original members and the deputies, discussed the topic on December 18. Funes said that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} rule the other provinces without their consent, and got the support of the other members. He said that there was popular discontent with the Junta. The supporters of Moreno said that such discontent was only among some rebels, and Moreno said that it was only the discontent of the Patricians in respect of the Suppressions decree. However, only Paso voted with him, and the deputies joined the Junta. Moreno resigned, but his resignation was rejected. His opposition to the incorporation of the deputies is seen by some historians as an initial step in the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces, which dominated politics in Argentina during the following decades. <b>Some</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a precursor of the Unitarian Party, while others find his words or actions more consistent with the Federal Party. However, historians Paul Groussac and Norberto Piñeiro feel it is inappropriate to extrapolate so far into the future. Piñeiro considered it an error to label Moreno as federal or unitary, proving that this organization been prioritized over the secondary aspect of centralism or federalism, while Groussac similarly notes that Moreno devoted all his energies to the immediate problem of achieving independence without giving much thought to possible long-term scenarios.|$|E

[...] One NPR contributor wrote that the nominees illustrated the range of Hawaiian music at the time, [...] "from traditional songs for guitar and ukulele to more modernized approaches". <b>Some</b> <b>Call</b> <b>It</b> Aloha... Don't Tell contained traditional Hawaiian folk songs and chants and the use of traditional instruments such as the acoustic bass and 12-string guitar. Hoʻokena members Many Boyd, Horache K. Dudoit III, Chris Kamaka and Glen H.K. Smith created music for Cool Elevation using the ukulele, acoustic bass, and guitar. Scott Iwasaki of the Deseret News described Amy & Willie Live as a [...] "playful array of Hawaiian jazz".

The award went to Brotman for the slack key guitar compilation album recorded in Hawaii and described by journalist Nate Chinen as [...] "an easy-listening instrumental compilation seemingly tailored to mainland tastes". According to Jon de Mello, founder of Hawaiian record label Mountain Apple Company, other nominees' [...] "jaws dropped on the ground" [...] at the ceremony in reaction to their works being overlooked. Chinen claimed the Academy's [...] "safe, bland" [...] choice set a precedent for compilations and slack key use (five nominees the following year were slack key albums).|$|E
