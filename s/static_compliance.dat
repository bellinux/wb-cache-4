40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The {{pathogenesis}} of dyspnoea {{in patients}} with chronic heart failure is poorly understood. <b>Static</b> lung <b>compliance</b> is reduced in chronic heart failure. The relation between <b>static</b> lung <b>compliance</b> and exercise capacity and dyspnoea in chronic heart failure has been investigated. METHODS [...] <b>Static</b> lung <b>compliance</b> was calculated from expiratory pressure-volume curves in 18 patients with chronic heart failure (three women, mean age 62 years). Catheter mounted pressure transducers were used to measure changes in oesophageal pressure. Changes in lung volume were determined by integrating flow at the mouth, measured by a pneumotachograph. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class for dyspnoea was determined by a single observer. Patients underwent treadmill exercise to symptom limited maximum using staged and fixed rate protocols. Borg ratings for dyspnoea at submaximal exercise were measured. RESULTS [...] <b>Static</b> lung <b>compliance,</b> whether expressed as % total lung capacity (TLC) /cm H 2 O or % predicted TLC/cm H 2 O, was unrelated to NYHA class. Similarly, there was no relation between <b>static</b> lung <b>compliance</b> and exercise capacity with either protocol or with Borg ratings for dyspnoea at submaximal exercise, {{with the exception of}} that measured after 11 minutes of the staged protocol.

Patients were classified as having pulmonary, extrapulmonary, or mixed/uncertain ARDS. Pressure-volume curves with and without PEEP were available for all patients, and pressure-volume curves with two PEEP levels were available for 44 patients. <b>Static</b> <b>compliance</b> was calculated as tidal volume divided by pressure change for tidal volumes of 400 and 700 ml. Recruited volume was measured at an elastic pressure of 15 cm H 2 O. RESULTS: Volume recruited by PEEP (10 +/- 3 cm H 2 O) was 223 +/- 111 ml in the pulmonary ARDS group (29 patients), 206 +/- 164 ml in the extrapulmonary group (16 patients), and 242 +/- 176 ml in the mixed/uncertain group (26 patients) (P = 0. 75). At high PEEP (14 +/- 2 cmH 2 O, 44 patients), recruited volumes were also similar (P = 0. 60).

40|$|Question: Are {{oxygenation}} and <b>static</b> <b>compliance</b> improved {{immediately after}} manual hyperinflation following myocardial revascularisation? Does this lead to earlier extubation and shorter hospital stay? Does it reduce postoperative pulmonary complications? Design: Randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation, blinded assessment and intention-to-treat analysis. Participants: Fifty-five patients who underwent myocardial revascularisation. Intervention: After {{an hour in}} recovery, the experimental group received manual hyperinflation with positive end expiratory pressure followed by suction while the control group received suction only. Outcome measures: Oxygenation (PaO₂ in mmHg) and static lung compliance (in ml/cmH₂O) were measured immediately after suction. Time to extubation (in minutes) and length of hospital stay (in days) were collected and postoperative pulmonary complications were confirmed by X-ray. Results: PaO₂ was 11. 7 mmHg (95 % CI 9. 4 to 14. 0) greater {{in the experimental group}} while <b>static</b> <b>compliance</b> was 8. 5 ml/cmH₂ 0 (95 % CI 6. 4 to 10. 6) greater than in the control group.

Peak expiratory flow rates were measured for each breath during manual hyperinflation using a Vitalograph peak flow meter. Sputum wet weight was collected for each treatment position and <b>static</b> pulmonary <b>compliance</b> was measured before and immediately following physiotherapy treatment. There was a significant increase in peak expiratory flow (p < 0. 001) and sputum production (p = 0. 008) in the head-down tilt position.

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} the cardiopulmonary effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) equalization to intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in an experimental model of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and acute lung injury (ALI). Methods: Eight anesthetized pigs were submitted to IAH of 20 mm Hg with a carbon dioxide insufflator for 30 {{minutes and then}} submitted to lung lavage with saline and Tween (2. 5 %). Pressure x volume curves of the respiratory system were performed by a low flow method during IAH and ALI, and PEEP was subsequently adjusted to 27 cm center dot H(2) O for 30 minutes. Results: IAH decreases pulmonary and respiratory system <b>static</b> <b>compliances</b> and increases airway resistance, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, and respiratory dead space. The presence of concomitant ALI exacerbates these findings. PEEP identical to AP moderately improved oxygenation and respiratory mechanics; however, an important decline in stroke index and right ventricle ejection fraction was observed.

Subjects and methods: A total of 53 patients with exogenous pulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome, who were admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} of the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from March 2009 to February 2013, were selected. They were randomly divided into the treatment group (25 cases) and the control group (28 cases). Both the groups were treated with conventional treatment and lung-protective ventilation strategy; apart from these, enema therapy with Xuanbai Chengqi decoction was given to the treatment group. Meanwhile, <b>static</b> lung <b>compliance,</b> dynamic lung compliance, peak airway pressure, plateau pressure, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for patients in both the groups were observed and recorded at 24, 48, and 72  hours after the drug was used.

Results: For patients in the treatment group, at 48  and 72  hours after treatment, the <b>static</b> lung <b>compliance</b> and dynamic lung compliance were significantly higher than those in the control group, while plateau pressure, peak airway pressure, and PEEP were significantly lower than those before treatment. At the same time, PEEP for patients in the treatment group at 72  hours after treatment was remarkably lower than that in the control group, showing significant difference (P< 0. 05).

Lung growth was assessed by plethysmography and lung mechanics using the single breath occlusion technique and oesophageal balloon/ pneumotachography. Antenatal maternal serum cotinine values were obtained from 133 mothers.  RESULTS—Smoking {{was associated with a}} significant reduction in birthweight (mean 256 g, 95 % CI 0. 164 to 0. 392), and length (mean 1. 26 cm, 95 % CI 0. 48 to 2. 00).

40|$|SummaryThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} new reference values and predictive variables for dynamic and static pulmonary compliance in men. The investigation was conducted as a prospective study in healthy, non-smoking men with normal pulmonary function parameters including spirometry, bodyplethysmography and CO diffusing capacity. The esophageal pressure method was used to measure dynamic compliance (Cdyn), specific dynamic compliance (Cdyn/ITGV), <b>static</b> <b>compliance</b> (Cstat) and specific <b>static</b> <b>compliance</b> (Cstat/ITGV). Lung recoil pressures were recorded at different levels of total lung capacity (TLC). A total of 208 men aged 20 – 69 years were included in the study. The mean values for the compliance parameters were: Cdyn: 2. 91 ± 1. 08 L/kPa; Cdyn/ITGV: 0. 71 ± 0. 30 kPa− 1; Cstat: 3. 34 ± 1. 04 L/kPa; Cstat/ITGV: 0. 82 ± 0. 31 kPa− 1. Cdyn, Cdyn/ITGV and Cstat/ITGV were significantly correlated with age and Cstat was related to height, but in multiple regression analyses the predictability for compliance parameters was very low. Lung recoil pressures at all TLC levels significantly decreased with ageing. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the contribution of anthropometric variables to the regression equations of pulmonary compliance was low.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the timing and relationship between the number of ultrasound lung comets, the PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio, and the <b>static</b> respiratory <b>compliance</b> in an experimental model of oleic acid-induced lung injury in pigs. Design: Laboratory experiment. Setting: Research institute. Subjects: Ten anesthetized pigs. Interventions: Acute lung injury was induced by injection of oleic acid (0. 1 mL/kg, intravenously). Ultrasound lung comets, PaO 2 /FIO 2, and <b>static</b> respiratory <b>compliance</b> were measured at baseline and at 15, 30, 60, and 90 mins after the injection of oleic acid. We evaluated ultrasound lung comets by transthoracic echography (7. 5 -MHz vascular probe), scanning on right and left hemithoraxes at 12 predefined scanning sites. Measurements and Main Results: Acute lung injury/acute re- spiratory distress syndrome was present in all pigs at 90 mins. The number of ultrasound lung comets increased over time and was consistently earlier than the decrease in PaO 2 /FIO 2. At 15 mins, ultrasound lung comets were markedly increased, but no significant changes in PaO 2 /FIO 2 were observed. Accordingly, <b>static</b> respiratory <b>compliance</b> was dramatically reduced at 15 mins compared with baseline (17. 04 1. 82 vs. 34. 84 2. 62 mL/cm H 2 O, p <. 05).
