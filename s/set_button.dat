5000|$|Much {{like the}} lever-set movements, these pocket watches {{had a small}} pin or knob next to the watch-stem {{that had to be}} {{depressed}} before turning the crown to set the time and releasing the pin when the correct time had been set. This style of watch is occasionally referred to as [...] "nail set", as the <b>set</b> <b>button</b> must be pressed using a finger.|$|E
50|$|Whilst Entertainment Weekly writer James Earl Hardy {{described}} the song as 'sexy R&B', Daryl Easlea of the BBC called it 'beautiful and passionately delivered' he also expressed, 'you long for it being recorded {{at a different}} time, not with Paris {{in front of a}} keyboard with an orchestra <b>setting</b> <b>button</b> and a drum machine'.|$|R
50|$|Calibrated {{calipers}} may be mishandled, {{leading to}} loss of zero. When a calipers' jaws are fully closed, it should of course indicate zero. If it does not, {{it must be}} recalibrated or repaired. It might seem that a vernier caliper cannot get out of calibration but a drop or knock can be enough. Digital calipers have zero <b>set</b> <b>buttons.</b>|$|R

50|$|Mortal Kombat 4 {{is played}} {{in a similar way}} to the {{previous}} titles from the series with some changes. MK4 introduces a limited weapon system, allowing each character to take out a special weapon using a <b>set</b> <b>button</b> combination. Once equipped, the weapons are primarily used through the punch buttons. This includes swinging, clubbing or even tossing the weapons. The weapons can also be purposely dropped, in similar fashion to the arena objects such as severed heads and rocks; if an opponent's weapon is dropped, the other character is able to pick it up and use it. By sidestepping, the player is able to move in a 3D manner, shifting the camera angle, preventing both characters from holding up the weapons or objects they had on the ground.|$|E
40|$|Conserving {{electricity}} {{has become}} increasingly important as energy rates and shortages have increased. Consumers can find {{a number of ways}} to cut back on their electrical use, especially with appliances commonly found in the home. Any economy that wants to advance must therefore embrace time management and proper conservation of electrical power supply. This can be achieved through limiting wastage in the limited power supply. The programmable control timer can be use to put ON or OFF any electrical appliance connected to it while the user attends to other things knowing fully well that Electronic Assistance is available. The user can preset the device to a certain value. This is possible with the use of <b>set</b> <b>button</b> on the device. The <b>set</b> <b>button</b> must be pressed to enable the time input buttons to be pressed. After presetting a certain time value, which is shown on the digital display, a press on the count button makes the preset time to countdown to zero. After attaining a “ 000 ” value, the appliance connected to its output sockets goes either ON or OFF...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} {{mathematical}} program to model and simulate photovoltaic modules. The tool will be provided with a graphical interface allowing the usage by users with little knowledge and without having a high level program installed on their computers. To begin the program, the user must select amog the three available that appear on the screen. Once a method is selected, the user must select a photovoltaic panel, so when the user clicks, two graphs appear on the left of the figure 1. These graphics will be obtained after modelling the PV panel. From these graphs, the user gets conclusions about the modelling of the photovoltaic panel. Then on the right side one can enter actual temperature and irradiance which will affect the panels when installed. This way one can compare the results. There is also an option that allows the introduction of new photovoltaic panels. The interface will ask for the parameters of this new panel and the user data will be saved for modelling or simulation. Similarly, one can delete introduced new panels, pressing their <b>set</b> <b>button</b> to delete all new panels or you can press the "delete new panel" to delete only one of new panels.

50|$|The Nikon F70 (or N70 as it {{is known}} in the U.S.) was a SLR camera {{manufactured}} by the Japanese Company Nikon. Introduced in 1994, it is the predecessor to the Nikon F80. This camera is known for its unusual user interface which uses a combination of function and <b>set</b> <b>buttons</b> along with the thumb wheel to navigate the nestled settings. It is quite different compared to other Nikon SLR's of the same era.|$|R

2500|$|B8050 {{machines}} offer a {{wider range}} of journey combinations than their predecessors, as they have separate <b>sets</b> of <b>buttons</b> for destinations and ticket types. [...] A set of machines was produced with 92 destination buttons, arranged in four columns of 23, and 18 ticket type buttons in a single column. [...] Another set of machines was manufactured with a restricted <b>set</b> of destination <b>buttons</b> (40, in four columns of ten) but the same 18 ticket type buttons. [...] In all cases, a [...] "Cancel" [...] button is available as well. [...] Destination buttons are green, while those for the ticket type are yellow and the [...] "Cancel" [...] button is red.|$|R

5000|$|Its match-needle meter {{instrument}} {{scale is}} visible in the viewfinder {{as well as on}} the top plate. The camera was originally equipped with the same coupled selenium meter as the Reflex S, but after 1962 a larger one was fitted, again made by Gossen. The Reflex III features the same [...] "setting wheel" [...] and interlocking aperture/shutter rings as the Reflex S. As it was fashion in the early 1960s the shutter release button on top was replaced by a shutter release shifter beside the lens mount. The film advance release button was eliminated, that function being incorporated in the frame reset slider, which was moved to the bottom plate along with the (still) manually reset frame counter. The ASA <b>setting</b> <b>button</b> was moved from the ASA dial to the spot vacated by the release button.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most {{hypertext}} systems, EDS incorporated state variables {{associated with}} each page. For example, clicking a button indicating a particular hardware fault might set a state variable that would expose a new <b>set</b> of <b>buttons</b> with links to a relevant choice of diagnostic pages. The EDS model prefigured graphic hypertext systems such as Apple's HyperCard.|$|R
50|$|Once {{a single}} {{solution}} is found, a solution with the {{minimum number of}} moves can be determined through elimination of redundant <b>sets</b> of <b>button</b> presses that have no cumulative effect. If the 5x5 puzzle is unsolvable under legal game creation, two leftmost lights on the bottom row will remain on when all other lights have been turned off.|$|R
50|$|The {{top panel}} usually {{contains}} a clock/calendar and a notification area, which can {{double as a}} sort of dock, as well. The bottom panel is commonly empty by default (other than a <b>set</b> of <b>buttons</b> to navigate between desktops) due to its use in the navigation between windows (windows minimize to the bottom panel by default).|$|R
50|$|Gamepads {{generally}} {{feature a}} <b>set</b> of <b>buttons</b> handled {{with the right}} thumb and a direction controller handled with the left. The direction controller has traditionally been a four-way digital cross (also named a joypad, or alternatively a d-pad, and never called arrow keys), but most modern controllers additionally (or as a substitute) feature one or more analog sticks.|$|R
50|$|A player may use a skill by {{clicking}} the skill symbol on the skill menu. A simpler way is <b>set</b> a <b>button</b> {{on the keyboard}} to that particular skill. Skills are also color-coded. Blue stands for Weapon skills, purple for Magic skills, gray for Miscellaneous skills, red for Action skills, and green for Emoticons. Symbols without a colored background (clear) are consumable items.|$|R
50|$|Controls {{placed to}} the left of the {{built-in}} LCD screen include DSP controls, touch-sensitivity, an alternate method of implementing sustain, and harmony and echo settings. The 550 was also the first keyboard to utilize a wide, easy to read, multi-color-changing display, which cycles between blue, red, and purple depending on operator activity. when selecting a function, the keyboard is idle, or when playing back a demo song. It was also the first keyboard to feature the Music Database system. The built-in floppy drive allows compositions to be saved, as well as the ability to download numerous new songs and keyboard configurations from the Internet. Additional controls include a toggle for auto-accompaniment, a tap-based tempo <b>setting</b> <b>button,</b> a transposition feature, and a rapid way to access the user's favorite presets. The Multi Pads allow drum sounds or short melodies to embellish user songs. The user can even record their own phrases for the Multi Pads.|$|R

50|$|The first {{practice}} session saw Jenson <b>Button</b> <b>set</b> the fastest lap time, one {{tenth of a}} second ahead of Mark Webber and Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton had set the early pace, using Pirelli's experimental development tyres, but Webber and Sebastian Vettel surpassed him, and <b>Button</b> <b>set</b> his fastest lap time as the session drew to a close. Ferrari drivers Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa experienced several off-track excusions between them. Romain Grosjean set a faster lap time than teammate Vitaly Petrov, though Petrov was forced to abandon his car during his final run with engine troubles. Rubens Barrichello was also forced out with technical problems, failing to set a lap time.|$|R
5000|$|A keypad is a <b>set</b> of <b>buttons</b> {{arranged}} in a block or [...] "pad" [...] which bear digits, symbols or alphabetical letters. Pads mostly containing numbers are called a numeric keypad.
