40|$|This {{study is}} {{aimed to develop}} a noise robust {{distributed}} speech recognizer (DSR) for real-world applications by employing Blind Equalization (BEQ) for robust feature extraction. The main focus {{of the work is}} to cope with different noisy environments in recognition phase. To realize this objective, Mel-LP based speech analysis has been used in speech coding on the linear frequency scale by applying a first-order all-pass filter instead of a unit delay. Mismatch between training and test phases is reduced through robust feature extraction and this is achieved by applying BEQ on Mel-LP cepstral coefficients as an effort to reduce additive noise and channel distortion. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated on test <b>set</b> <b>A</b> and <b>set</b> <b>C</b> of Aurora- 2 database. The baseline performance, that is, for Mel-LPC the average word accuracy has found to be 59. 05 % and 63. 99 % for <b>sets</b> <b>A</b> and <b>C,</b> respectively. By applying the BEQ on Mel-LP cepstral coefficients, the performance has been improved to 65. 66 % and 64. 65 % for <b>sets</b> <b>A</b> and <b>C,</b> respectively...|$|R
