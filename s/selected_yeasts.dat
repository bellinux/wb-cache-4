40|$|Abstract Makgeolli, {{also known}} as Takju, is a {{non-filtered}} traditional Korean alcoholic beverage that contains various floating matter, including yeast cells, which contributes to its high physiological functionality. In the present study, we assessed the levels of β-glucan and glutathione in various yeast strains isolated from traditional Korean Nuruk and selected a β-glucan- and glutathione-rich yeast strain to add value to Makgeolli by enhancing its physiological functionality through increased levels of these compounds. Yeast β-glucan levels ranged from 6. 26 % to 32. 69 % (dry basis) and were strongly species-dependent. Dried Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolated from Nuruk contained 25. 53 μg/mg glutathione, 0. 70 μg/mg oxidized glutathione, and 11. 69 μg/ g and 47. 85 μg/g spermidine and L-ornithine monohydrochloride, respectively.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was the study of indigenous yeasts isolated from spontaneous fermentation of Inzolia grapes, one of the most widespread native white grapes in Sicily (Italy). The use of selective medium for the isolation and the screening for sulphur dioxide tolerance were useful for the first selection among 640 isolates. The yeasts characterized by high SO 2 tolerance were identified at species level by restriction analysis of ITS region; although the majority of isolates were identified as S. cerevisiae, some non-Saccharomyces yeasts were found. Forty-seven <b>selected</b> <b>yeasts,</b> both S. cerevisiae and non-Saccharomyces yeasts, were characterized for genetic and technological diversity.
