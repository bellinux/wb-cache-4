40|$|Rainfall-induced {{failures}} {{of natural and}} artificial slopes such as cut slopes, which are subjected to freezing and thawing, have been frequently reported in Hokkaido, Japan. In particular, many failures occur intensively from spring to summer seasons. Despite numerous field studies, explanation of their mechanical behavior based on in situ data {{has not yet been}} completely achieved due to the difficulty in grasping failure conditions. This study aims at clarifying the aspects of in-situ volcanic slopes subjected to rainfall and freeze-thaw action. The changes in soil moisture, pore pressure, deformations, and temperatures in the slope were investigated using soil moisture meters, tensiometers, thermocouple sensors, clinometers, <b>settlement</b> <b>gauges,</b> an anemovane, a snow gauge, and a rainfall gauge. The data generated from these measures indicated deformation in the slope examined mainly proceeded during the drainage process according to changes in soil moisture.

40|$|The ongoing Changi East Reclamation Project in Singapore {{consists}} of land reclamation and ground improvement {{works of the}} foreshore for the future expansion of the Changi International airport and associated facilities. Reclamation works in the project involve the hydraulic placement of sand-fill over the seabed, which is underlain by thick, highly compressible Singapore marine clay. Ground improvement works in the project comprise the installation of vertical drains and the subsequent placement of surcharge to accelerate the consolidation of the underlying marine clay. A pilot test site {{was carried out in}} the project, comprising three sub-areas that were installed with vertical drains at various spacings, plus a fourth untreated sub-area. The four sub-areas were surcharged simultaneously and preloaded for a duration of 32 months. A comprehensive field instrumentation programme was implemented in the pilot test site, comprising settlement plates, deep <b>settlement</b> <b>gauges,</b> piezometers and water standpipes. The degree of improvement attained by the foundation soil at each sub-area was determined and assessed during the process of consolidation and 32 months after surcharge placement using the observational method.

40|$|Ground {{improvement}} is often required in land reclamation projects on soft soil deposits to reduce future settlement under the projected future dead and live loads. In {{the case of}} thick deposits of marine clay, it is often necessary to accelerate the consolidation process of the clay using prefabricated vertical drains. In such projects, the degree of improvement has to be ascertained to confirm whether the soil has achieved the required degree of consolidation before the removal of surcharge. This analysis {{can be carried out}} by means of observational methods for which the ground behaviour is continuously monitored from the date of instrument installation. This paper provides a case study of the applications of geotechnical instrumentation for construction control in the Changi East reclamation project in the Republic of Singapore. Field instruments adopted in this project included settlement plates, deep <b>settlement</b> <b>gauges,</b> earth pressure cells, pneumatic piezometers, electric piezometers and water standpipes. Some of the field instruments were installed offshore. Special techniques were adopted to protect these offshore instruments before placement of sand fill by hydraulic pumping. Geotechnical instruments were also used in the construction control process to monitor the deformation of ground and the stability of the earth and retaining structure. Field instrumentation readings obtained from a pilot test area comprising a vertical drain area (horizontal vertical drain spacing 1 · 5 m × 1 · 5 m) and an adjacent control area (no vertical drains) are also presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|In land {{reclamation}} on marine clay formations, ground improvement works is often {{necessary to be}} carried out in order to negate future settlement under the projected dead and live loads. In the case of thick deposits of marine clay, it is necessary to accelerate the consolidation process. The use of prefabricated vertical drains with preloading option is the most widely-used ground improvement method for such cases. In such ground improvement projects in soft soil, the degree of improvement attained by the marine clay has to be ascertained to confirm whether the soil has achieved the required degree of consolidation to enable surcharge removal. This analysis can be carried out by means of observational methods for which continuous records of ground behavior can be monitored from the date of instrument installation. Field instruments are used to verify the performance of the soil improvement works and to ensure that the specified degree of consolidation due to the sandfill and surcharge loading had been achieved prior to the removal of the surcharge. Field instruments installed, monitored and analyzed in such projects include settlement plates, deep <b>settlement</b> <b>gauges,</b> earth pressure cells, pneumatic piezometers, electric piezometers and water-standpipes. The type of field instrumentations installed and their method of analysis is discussed in this paper.

40|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of land at coastal regions around the world, land reclamation is commonly carried out for the future expansion of various infrastructure facilities. Marine clay is present at the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. Land reclamation on this highly compressible soil foundation often {{requires the use of}} soil improvement works to eliminate significant future settlements from occurring. The combination of prefabricated vertical drains with preloading {{is one of the most}} widely used ground improvement methods in land reclamation projects. The best means available for field measurement and back-analysis of the marine clay geotechnical characteristics under reclamation fills is by carrying out extensive field instrumentation and in-situ tests. In-situ testing of marine clay was carried out at a test site. In-situ penetration testing was used to analyse the degree of consolidation, the improved shear strengths, overconsolidation ratio and the effective stress of marine clay prior to reclamation as well as after surcharge loading. In-situ dissipation testing was used to determine the coefficient of consolidation due to horizontal flow and horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the marine clay prior to reclamation as well as after surcharge loading. The in-situ penetration and dissipation tests were carried out by means of the field vane shear, piezocone, dilatometer, self-boring pressuremeter and BAT permeameter. Field instrumentation methods, assessment and hack-analysis of marine clay behaviour under reclamation fills forms the crux of this research. The factors that affect the field instrumentation assessment of marine clays treated with prefabricated vertical drains, forms an integral part of this research study. <b>Settlement</b> <b>gauges</b> and piezometers were used to monitor the performance of the vertical drains and to assess the degree of consolidation of the improved soil at two case study sites. The field settlement data were back-analysed by the Asaoka and Hyperbolic methods to predict the ultimate settlement of the reclaimed land under the surcharge fill. Back-analysis of the field settlement and piezometer monitoring data also enabled the coefficient of consolidation due to horizontal flow to be closely estimated. Finite element modeling of marine clay and prefabricated vertical drains was carried out and compared with the field surface settlement results at the two case study sites...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{includes}} mathematical {{simulation of}} smear effects in a 2 -D plane strain {{finite element model}} employing the modified Cam-clay theory, and the experimental evaluation of smear zone propagation around vertical drains using a large scale, radial drainage consolidometer. The original axisymmetric analysis of vertical drains including the effect of smear and well resistance {{has been well documented}} in the past. In contrast, in this study, the analysis of a unit cell is conducted by converting the axisymmetric (radial) permeability into an equivalent plane strain model Thereafter, a multi-drain, plane strain analysis is conducted to study the performance of the entire embankment stabilised with vertical drains, for number of case histories taken from Southeast Asia. laboratory technique of evaluating the extent of smear around vertical drains is elaborated. In this approach, a central vertical drain was installed in soil specimens placed in a large steel cell (450 mm in diameter and 950 mm in height), using a specially designed mandrel. Once the drain was installed, smaller specimens were recovered from various radial distances from the drain, and the horizontal and vertical permeabilities of these specimens were determined by standard oedometer tests. The extent of the smear zone was established {{as a function of the}} horizontal and vertical permeability ratio (kh/kv). It was found that the ktJh ratio decreased significantly towards the central drain. It is also revealed that the krfkv ratio approaches unity soil drain interface, and is about 1. 3 at the undisturbed region outside the smear zone. Axial and radial permeabilities were converted to 2 -D plane strain parameters based on the mathematical model developed in this study. The mathematical model was used in conjunction with finite element analysis (CRISP) to determine the settlements, lateral movements and pore pressures. selected case histories include a number of embankments stabilised with vertical drains in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. The embankments were well instrumented with <b>settlement</b> <b>gauges,</b> piezometers and inclinometers. The settlements, excess pore pressures and lateral displacements were predicted using the plane strain, multi-drain model, and the results were compared with the fields measurements. The effect of smear was found to be significant in controlling the performance of vertical drains, while the role of well resistance was found to be insignificant. The model described in this thesis provides an excellent plane strain formulation capable of predicting the behaviour of embankments constructed on soft clay foundations stabilised with vertical drains...|$|R
