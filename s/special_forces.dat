5|$|After those {{operations}} in Phước Long district and Phước Bình sub-sector, the Viet Cong 9th Division {{was ordered to}} attack Đồng Xoài. In 1965, Đồng Xoài was a district town situated at a road junction which connected Inter-Inter-Provisional Road 13, National Highway 1 and Highway 14. The district was defended by 200 local Vietnamese soldiers drawn from the 327th and 328th Militia Companies, and the 111th Regional Force Company. They were supported by one armoured squadron (6 armoured vehicles) and two 105mm howitzers. There were also 200 Cambodian soldiers of a Civilian Irregular Defense Group, 11 United States Army <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> personnel, and nine U.S. Navy Seabees. Prior to the battle, the U.S <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> had assumed control of Đồng Xoài's defences; they stepped up guard and patrol activities, and ordered {{the construction of new}} defensive fortifications around the district headquarters, the <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> Camp, and the armoured and artillery positions on {{the eastern side of the}} district.|$|E
5|$|At 2am on March 10, 1975, the North Vietnamese army {{began their}} assault on South Vietnamese forces at Ban Me Thuot. The North Vietnamese 198th <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> Regiment spearheaded the attack by hitting the Hoa Binh Airfield, the {{district}} of Mai Hac De, and {{the headquarters of the}} ARVN 53rd Infantry Regiment. The initial North Vietnamese attack, which was marked by heavy artillery bombardment and actions initiated by the 198th <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> Regiment, had shocked ARVN Colonels Nguyen Trong Luat and Vu The Quang, both subordinates of Major General Pham Van Phu. Despite the strength of the initial assault, Quang believed the North Vietnamese only wanted to cause disruption and would withdraw their forces by daybreak. By 3:30am, the 4th Battalion, 198th <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> Regiment, had successfully secured Phan Chu Trinh Road and the southern part of Hoa Binh airport, and they waited there for the regular infantry and tank units to arrive.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{originally}} {{intended as a}} defensive weapon for military personnel whose primary role is not fighting with small arms (such as vehicle drivers), most sales of the P90 have been to <b>special</b> <b>forces</b> and counter-terrorist groups who use it for offensive roles.

5|$|In the meantime, Nhu {{prepared}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> commanded by Colonel Lê Quang Tung— {{who took his}} orders directly from Nhu and not the senior generals— for the raids. An American-trained outfit created to fight the Việt Cộng, the <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> were better-equipped, better-trained and better-paid than the regular army, but were used by the Ngô family as a private army for repressing dissidents and protecting their rule, rather than fighting for the national interest. As such, they spent {{the majority of their}} time in Saigon warding off coup attempts. Tung brought more <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> into Saigon, bringing the total from two to four battalions in the capital.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, as General William C.

Subsequently, Colonel Jonathan F. Ladd—commanding officer of the 5th <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> Group — and Major General Norman J.

5|$|On 25 February 1994, the <b>special</b> <b>forces</b> of the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) were reorganised {{when all}} HV's <b>special</b> <b>forces</b> units were {{combined}} {{to form the}} 1st Croatian Guards Corps (1. hrvatski gardijski zbor). In April, personnel of the 8th Military Police Light Assault Brigade (itself only established in September 1993) were also transferred to the corps, ultimately making the corps 2,500-strong. In addition to <b>special</b> <b>forces</b> operations, the corps was also tasked with providing security for the President of Croatia. The corps was organised into four specialised battalions and the 1st Croatian Guards Brigade (1. hrvatski gardijski zdrug – HGZ), a multi-purpose <b>special</b> <b>forces</b> combat unit. The HGZ was considered the elite unit of the HV. The entire corps was directly subordinated to the Ministry of Defence rather than the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia, and reported directly to the president. It was commanded by Major General Mile Ćuk. Ćuk and his deputy were based in the Presidential Palace, while {{the bulk of the}} corps was based in nearby Tuškanac barracks. The HGZ was capable of fielding up to 300 troops in combat. It was commanded by Colonel (later Major General) Miljenko Filipović, who had previously commanded the Zrinski Battalion—one of the <b>special</b> <b>forces</b> units amalgamated into the corps.|$|E
