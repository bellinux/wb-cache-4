50|$|Over {{the course}} of her career, Bernasconi {{described}} a number of new genus and <b>species.</b> <b>Her</b> first taxonomic publication, in which new species from the genus Pteraster were described, was published in 1935. In 1941 she described two new species from the genus Luidia. Between 1937 and 1980, Bernasconi revised the taxonomy of a number of families: Pterasteridae, Luidiidae, Odontasteridae, Gonisasteridae, Ganeriidae, Asterinidae and Echinasteridae. In 1965 she described the new genus of Vemaster along with four new species.|$|R

40|$|Of 78 Gabonese {{individuals}} who had received bites from nonhuman primates (NHPs) while hunting, 7 were infected with human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV- 1). Five had been bitten by gorillas and were infected with subtype B strains; however, a 12 -year-old girl who was severely bitten by a Cercopithecus nictitans was infected with a subtype D strain that was {{closely related to the}} simian T lymphotropic virus (STLV- 1) that infects this monkey <b>species.</b> <b>Her</b> mother was infected with a subtype B strain. These data confirm that hunters in Africa can be infected by HTLV- 1 that is closely related to the strains circulating among local NHP game.

50|$|Darna's powers include flight, super strength, super {{speed and}} nigh-invulnerability. In the 2003 retcon, the latest {{releases}} of the comic, {{this is due}} to her psionic background. Thus a form of telekinesis enhances her speed and strength and allows her flight. Her skin has a high level of invulnerability because of <b>her</b> <b>species.</b> <b>Her</b> psionic abilities also allow her to exercise limited psionic influence or telepathy. For weapons, the ruby encrusted in the winged medallion on her helmet also augments her psionic abilities, allowing her to emit a powerful concussion blast and the medallions that make up her belt can be used like throwing stars (shuriken). In the 2005 TV series, she also has heat vision, lent by the ruby. In some of the films, she uses her bracelets to deflect bullets.|$|R

50|$|While {{a student}} in London, Newbigin began {{conducting}} her own research, based at the laboratories of the Royal College of Physicians.

D. Paton. In addition, she was given an opportunity to study and report on the vast collections of marine organisms recovered decades before by the Challenger expedition, and to perform research and expand her natural history knowledge at the Marine Biological Station Millport. She brought her work and the published literature on marine organisms' colouration together in Colour in Nature (1898) and Life by the Sea Shore (1901), which were praised as both scientifically rigorous and remarkably accessible. These early works of hers remained widely read for many years after their publication.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{hypersensitivity}} pneumonitis in a 30 -yr-old female housewife caused by Penicillium <b>species</b> found in <b>her</b> home environment.

To identify the causative agent, cultured aeromolds were collected by the open-plate method.

A fungal colonies were isolated from the patient’s home.

In our hands these primers {{do not appear to}} discriminate between tooth fungi and other wood decay species.

Using the HER 2 F/HER 3 R primers together with traditional isolation and direct incubation procedures, the location of C. cirrhatus in Turkey oak logs was mapped. The PCR approach often detected C. cirrhatus in locations where it was suspected to be, based on patterns of staining and decay, but where it was not revealed by isolation onto agar media, emphasising the value of adopting several approaches to unravel fungal community structure in wood...|$|R
