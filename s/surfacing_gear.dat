Based on the analysis of sliding ratio, coincidence degree and the gear tooth root bending fatigue strength, basic parameters of gear can be modified to improve strength. Although these gears must be cut by the standard tools, high strength gears are needed in machinery.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{concentrate}} on acetal gear wear behaviour and its performance prediction based on the extensive investigations on the gear thermal mechanical contact both experimentally and numerically. It has been found from the tests that acetal gear wear rate will be increased dramatically when the load reaches a critical value for a specific geometry and running speed. The <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> will wear slowly with a low specific wear rate if the gear is loaded below the critical one. The possible reason of the sudden increase in wear rate {{is due to the}} gear operating temperature reaching the material melting point under the critical load condition. <b>Gear</b> <b>surface</b> temperature has been then investigated in details through three components: ambient, bulk and flash temperatures. Through extensive experimental investigations and modelling on <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> temperature variations, a general relation has been built up between <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> temperature and <b>gear</b> load capacity. An approach for acetal gear transition torque prediction has been proposed and this method is based on the link between polymer gear wear rate and its surface temperature. The method has been related to test results under different operating speeds and gear geometries. Good agreements have been achieved between the proposed method predictions and experimental test results. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|<b>Surface</b> {{roughness}} of <b>gear</b> <b>surfaces</b> has {{a significant}} impact on the life of gear tooth contacts in a drivetrain. We use an optical profilometer to scan the <b>surface</b> of a <b>gear</b> tooth from the drivetrain. Although the profilometer does several calculations, we are looking for more options and capabilities to aid in the gear sample analysis. To meet this goal, a MATLAB program was developed to calculate the average of absolute values (Ra), root mean squared (RMS), skewness, kurtosis, and average correlation length for each set of data. In addition, the program removes large spikes and fills in null points. It was found that the deddendum region had about twice the average Ra and RMS of the rest of the gear tooth. This region is one place where gear teeth slide against each other when interlocking. Lower Ra and RMS values are preferred since it will result in a lower coefficient of friction leading to less wear. An understanding of the effect of surface roughness on the life of a gear contact can help prevent future failures of drivetrains or similar components...|$|R
