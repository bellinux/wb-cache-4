5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in overcast weather conditions. Häkkinen clinched his fourth pole position of the season, his first since the San Marino Grand Prix, with a time of 1:10.410. He was joined on the front row of the grid by teammate Coulthard who was three-tenths of a second off Häkkinen's pace. Coulthard felt he could have challenged for pole position but he clipped a kerb going into Castrol Kurve on his final run which cost him time. Both drivers were satisfied with their car's balance. Barrichello qualified third and said that he changed his car's set-up to help him to achieve a better lap time. Michael Schumacher qualified fourth, six-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen, and reported that his car's handling was uneven throughout the circuit. He also had a high-speed spin during the session and aborted his final run after he made a mistake at the exit of Gösser corner. Trulli qualified fifth having used the soft compound tyres to set his fastest lap time. Zonta and Villeneuve set the sixth and seventh fastest times respectively for BAR, both drivers spun during the session. Fisichella recorded the eighth quickest time although he lost a bargeboard when he went off the circuit. He felt he could have secured fifth but a yellow-flag caused him to reduce his pace. Salo and Verstappen completed the top ten positions. Diniz missed qualifying in the top ten by two-thousands of a second and spun off while setting lap times, triggering a yellow-flag. de la Rosa managed twelfth, having struggled with the conditions during the session. He qualified ahead of Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld and Wurz. Frentzen, fifteenth, ran the hard compound tyres and his lap times were set early in the session before track conditions had improved. Frentzen said it was because he felt rain would hit the circuit towards the end of qualifying. Herbert started from sixteenth, after stopping on one run because to a broken left rear suspension caused by a loose <b>suspension</b> <b>bracket</b> at the Niki Lauda Kurve. A rear wishbone on his car had also been flexing. Alesi qualified seventeenth. Jenson Button used the spare Williams car set up for Ralf Schumacher because Button's race car had engine issues and qualified eighteenth. Button additionally struggled with driving the spare car. His teammate Ralf Schumacher qualified nineteenth in the Williams team's worst qualifying performance of the season. Burti and the two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} field, covering positions twenty to twenty-two.|$|E
50|$|The better-known J. T. Marshall gear was a {{modified}} Walschaerts valve gear which was first {{applied to a}} Great Northern Railway mineral locomotive, no. 743, in 1901 and received a glowing report. Next, it was tried on GNR Class C2 No. 1520 in March 1903. There was no external change visible on the locomotive {{as a result of}} this modification. When the valve gear was in use, the motion was derived from two eccentrics, one of which gave lap and lead movement by swinging the link backwards and forwards on its <b>suspension</b> <b>bracket.</b> The other eccentric was set at 90 degrees to the crank and rocked the link by means of a bell crank on the hanging link pin. The position of the radius rod die pin in the link determined the direction of movement and the cutoff. Showing little advantage over the normal Stephenson link valve gear, it was removed from the C2 'Atlantic' in April 1907 to ease maintenance.|$|E

40|$|In {{automobile}} design, {{the safety}} of passengers is of prime concern to the manufacturers. Suspension {{is one of the}} safety-related automotive systems which is responsible for maintaining traction between the road and tires, and offers a comfortable ride experience to the passengers by absorbing disturbances. One of the critical components of the suspension system is the knuckle, which constantly faces cyclic loads subjecting it to fatigue failure. This paper presents an evaluation of the fatigue characteristics of a knuckle using a gravel road profile acquired using a data acquisition system and standard SAE profiles for the <b>suspension</b> (SAESUS), <b>bracket</b> (SAEBRAKT) and transmission (SAETRN). The gravel road profile was applied as the input to a multi body simulation (MBS), and the load history for various mounting points of the knuckle is extracted. Fatigue life is predicted using the strain-life method. The instantaneous stress distributions and maximum principal stress are used for fatigue life predictions. From the results, the strut connection is found to be the critical region for fatigue failure. The fatigue life from loading extracted from gravel road MBS agreed well with the life prediction when standard SAE profiles were used. This close agreement shows the effectiveness of the load extraction technique from MBS. This method can also be effectively used for more complex loading conditions that occur during real driving environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Automotive chassis is an {{important}} part of an automobile. The chassis serves as a frame work for supporting the body and different parts of the automobile it should be rigid enough to withstand the fatigue, shock, twist, vibration and other stresses. Along with strength, {{an important}} consideration in chassis design is to have adequate low damage and higher fatigue life. To improve the fatigue life and damage reduction are the two important criteria for the design of the chassis. This work deals with the analysis of the truck chassis. Structural systems like the chassis can be easily analyzed using the finite element techniques with a proper finite element model of the chassis. The work also deals with the static analysis, modal analysis of the chassis and fatigue analysis of FESM (FRONT END <b>SUSPENSION</b> MOUNTING) <b>BRACKET</b> of chassis, on the user requirements and improving its payload by changing the shape and thickness of the bracket which is attached to the present chassis frame. The FEM analysis is carried out with various alternatives. The truck chassis is modeled in CATIA V 5 and the finite element modeling is carried out using Altair's pre-processing tool HYPER MESH. Static analysis is performed by using MSC NASTRAN/ANSYS to determine the high stress region, and also the maximum displacement. fatigue analysis is performed by using N-Code to determine the damage and life of the FESM bracket. The results are viewed through Altair's post-processing tool HYPER VIEW. it is observed that maximum stress induced is 155. 7 mpa which is less than the allowable stress of steel 205 mpa, natural frequencies of six global modes were below 100 Hz, varying from 20 Hz to 90 Hz. Almost all of the truck chassis designs were based on these frequency ranges to avoid the resonance during the operating condition, the fatigue life of existe...|$|R
