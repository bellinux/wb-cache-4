5|$|The <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> {{airborne}} particulates from the fires posed {{a threat to}} local communities on several occasions. <b>Smoke</b> <b>and</b> particulates were especially high in Gardiner, Montana. There, monitoring stations maintained by the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences and the park recorded 19 days where recommended allowable particulate concentrations were exceeded. This was also the case near fires, and on 7 occasions at Mammoth, Montana, {{the location of the}} park headquarters. In no other surrounding communities were particulates found to be above acceptable levels. <b>Smoke</b> <b>and</b> haze made driving difficult and sometimes even dangerous. A number of fire fighters were treated at clinics for <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> dust inhalation and a few for inadvertently inhaling fumes from a sulfur ignition near one of the geothermal areas.|$|E

Some of the dishes include {{sausages}} called kazy and chuchuk or shuzhyk made from the meat using the guts as the sausage skin, zhaya made from hip meat which is <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> boiled, jal (or zhal) made from neck fat which is <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> boiled, karta made from a section of the rectum which is <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> boiled, and sur-et which is kept as dried meat.|$|R

5|$|As the German ships {{approached}} Glorious, Acasta, {{which had}} been trying to maintain the smokescreen, broke through her own <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> fired two volleys of torpedoes at Scharnhorst. One of these hit the battleship at 17:34 abreast her rear turret and badly damaged her. Acasta also managed one hit from her 4.7-inch guns on Scharnhorst, but was riddled by German gunfire and sank at around 18:20.|$|E
5|$|During the {{confused}} fighting, French and Russian units moved forward into impenetrable <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> were smashed by artillery and musketry fire that was horrendous even by Napoleonic standards. Infantry and cavalrymen had difficulty maneuvering over the heaps of corpses and masses of wounded. Murat advanced with his cavalry around the flèches to attack Bagration's infantry, but {{was confronted by}} Duka's 2ndCuirassier Division supported by Neverovsky's infantry.|$|E
5|$|From 1869 at the latest, {{the company}} owning the Walker Engine Works was Bells, Goodman & Co. In that year the firm made the {{tunnelling}} shield and iron castings to line the Tower subway tunnels. In 1871 the firm made pumping and winding engines for Seghill Colliery. In 1875 it made machinery to condense <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> gases for Clyde Lead Works of Glasgow.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: A {{variety of}} <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> {{smokeless}} tobacco products with varying nicotine content are accessible in India. Nicotine quantity in tobacco products has direct bearing on tobacco dependence. Our {{objective was to}} estimate nicotine content in various types of <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> smokeless products. Disclosure for essential health warning was also checked. Materials and Methods: Liquid-liquid extraction was used for nicotine extraction and high-performance thin layer chromatography technique was applied for quantification of nicotine in seventy-one <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> smokeless tobacco products. Results: Significant variation in nicotine content was observed across products. In smoked tobacco, nicotine content varied from 1. 01 to 13. 0 mg/rod, while in smokeless tobacco products it ranged from 0. 8 mg/g to 50. 0 mg/g. Moisture content varied from 9 % to 21 %. Conclusion: This work lists a range of <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> smokeless tobacco products available in this region. We report a wide variability in nicotine quantity across <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> smokeless tobacco products. Such variation in nicotine content may {{have important implications for}} tobacco cessation interventions and policies...|$|R

5|$|Just {{outside the}} main walls, the castle mills had become {{increasingly}} ineffective from the 16th century onwards {{because of a}} reduction in the flow of the rivers driving the water-wheels. As a result, in 1778 they were rebuilt with a new steam engine to drive the machinery; this steam engine caused considerable discomfort to the prisoners affected by the <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> noise.|$|E

5|$|The Russian {{doctrine}} of military deception has evolved with time, and it encompasses {{a number of}} meanings. The Russian term маскировка (maskirovka) literally means masking. An early military meaning was camouflage, soon extended to battlefield masking using <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> other methods of screening. From there it came to have the broader meaning of military deception, widening to include denial and deception.|$|E
5|$|A severe {{fire at the}} Grand Central {{station on}} April 21, 1964, {{destroyed}} the demonstration train and manual operation had been restored since. The fire began under a shuttle train on track 3, and it became larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The train on Track 1 was saved when the motorman saw <b>smoke,</b> <b>and</b> reversed the train. The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on April 23, 1964, while Track 3 returned to service on June 1, 1964. The reinstallation of Track 3 was delayed {{because of the need}} to replace 60 beams that were damaged in the fire. Initially, a decision was not made concerning whether or not the automated shuttle train should be reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} in the photograph The Falling Man), landing {{on the streets and}} rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below. Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors were locked. No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E

Aluminium {{is a common}} pyrotechnic ingredient, and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat, including in thermite mixtures. Phosphorus {{can be found in}} <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> incendiary munitions, paper caps used in toy guns, and party poppers. Selenium has been used {{in the same way as}} tellurium.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fights}} for the ramparts of Wola, only {{artillery}} {{of the second}} line gave limited support to the outnumbered Polish troops. Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the first line, but apparently none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division manning the second line, could have supported the forts of the first line, {{but he could not}} see what was happening in Fort 56 due to dense <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> the trees of Brühl's Garden.|$|E
5|$|Feth-i Bülend saw {{extensive}} {{service in}} the Black Sea during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, based primarily at Batumi. She {{took part in the}} bombardment of Russian positions and capture of the Black Sea port of Sokhumi on 14–16 May 1877. On 23 July, she engaged the Russian armed steamer Vesta in an inconclusive action. Poor visibility from <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> escaping steam forced the ships to disengage, both with slight damage and few casualties. On the 31st, Feth-i Bülend and several other ships departed Batumi for Trabzon to bring ground troops to Varna to defend against an expected Russian attack across the Danube.|$|E

5|$|If {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs in}} a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to <b>smoke,</b> <b>and</b> the many benefits of smoking cessation.

Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, {{more than}} 90% {{of the workers}} and {{visitors}} {{who died in the}} towers had been at or above the points of impact. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped and died of smoke inhalation, fell or jumped from the tower to escape the <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> flames, or were killed in the building's eventual collapse. The destruction of all three staircases in the tower when Flight 11 hit made it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact died as well.|$|E
