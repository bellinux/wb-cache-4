That year Gregory initiated a major trip through the South to promulgate the religion. He travelled to Richmond, Virginia, Durham, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, the city of his family and childhood, and Macon, Georgia. After this first trip Gregory went on pilgrimage and was elected to positions in the religion and worked on concerns in race-integration in Washington D.C. which were settled with `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit, and his marriage - Gregory eventually returned to traveling to promote the religion but his endeavors were national in scope against a backdrop of <b>societal</b> <b>challenges</b> like Lynching in the United States and Jim Crow laws amidst Racism in the United States and instances of Mass racial violence in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Stankonia {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from contemporary}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 95, based on 20 reviews. Derek A. Bardowell of NME noted that with Stankonia, OutKast [...] "hit that rare balance of creative eccentricity and mass appeal" [...] and {{wrote that the}} album contains [...] "eternal qualities that will unravel in time on an emotional, intellectual and spiritual level." [...] Nathan Brackett of Rolling Stone called the record [...] "one of the best albums of the year" [...] noting {{that all of the}} tracks contain [...] "a down-home generosity and accessibility" [...] and that [...] "even the most street-oriented songs have some sort of commentary in them." [...] Tony Green of The Village Voice praised OutKast's [...] "feel for sonics and structure" [...] and stated, [...] "they've moved toward harder, darker textures, in service of song designs that are often disarmingly subtle." [...] Steve Huey of AllMusic commented that, [...] "given the variety of moods, it helps that the album is broken up by brief, usually humorous interludes, which serve as a sort of reset button. It takes a few listens to pull everything together, but given the immense scope, it's striking how few weak tracks there are". Aishah Hight of PopMatters stated, [...] "Within Stankonia, Outkast successfully presented a southern perspective of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But on the surface, phat beats and pure funk should suffice." [...] Alternative Press commented that [...] "experienced, acclaimed groups rarely make albums as bold and confrontational as Stankonia, because they have too much to lose", but felt that [...] "OutKast don't care", writing that they [...] "coalesced the political and <b>societal</b> <b>challenges</b> of hip hop's past into what is one of the genre's most artistically unorthodox releases so far." ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction] The {{aim of this}} {{working paper}} is the {{provision}} of a list of IPC classes assigned {{to each of the}} technology-oriented <b>Societal</b> Grand <b>Challenges</b> (SGCs) of Horizon 2020 and the description of the methods and workings steps that have led to this list. Patents are a vested right on the exclusive use of a certain technological solution. In consequence, patent data can only be collected for technology-driven or at least partially technology-affected areas. In terms of the <b>Societal</b> Grand <b>Challenges,</b> we see that six out of seven of them have at least in part a technology-affection, while one - namely "Europe in a changing world, inclusive, innovative and reflective societies" - can hardly be defined based on patent classes. We are fully {{aware of the fact that}} the <b>Societal</b> Grand <b>Challenges</b> have other, non-technical dimensions, which cannot be grasped on the basis of patents or patent statistics. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a definition of the technological dimensions of the <b>Societal</b> Grand <b>Challenges,</b> while other dimensions will not be addressed. Next to definitions of patent classes for the six Grand Challenges, also definitions of the sub-fields of the <b>Societal</b> Grand <b>Challenges</b> will be provided.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore how the quest for {{management}} as a science-based profession, conceived as a grand <b>societal</b> <b>challenge,</b> can be revitalized. A reflective approach is adopted by questioning some of the key 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eassumptions made by management scholars, especially those that undermine their capacity to inform management practice. One key assumption is that management needs to be done by a few people at the top of the organization; this idea is widespread but false. An important finding is that the future of the management discipline may largely depend on the rise of new forms of management drawing on distributed intelligence and circularity of power and authority. Management scholars thus need to shift their attention from an almost exclusive focus on managerial intentions and behaviors to (the development and use of new) management technologies, similar to how modern aviation technology involves airplanes that only to a limited extent require intervention and control by a single pilot. The practical implications of the shift from managerial behavior to management technology are illustrated by means of so-called circular management practices, also known as holacracy and sociocracy. This paper provides a novel perspective on how the quest for science-based professionalism in management, as a grand <b>societal</b> <b>challenge,</b> can be revitalized...|$|R
