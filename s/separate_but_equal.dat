Byrd campaigned on his stance of <b>separate</b> <b>but</b> <b>equal.</b> McKeldin won comfortable majorities in Baltimore's black, Jewish, and upper-middle class white districts, while Byrd took all of the blue-collar white South and East Baltimore neighborhoods, including McKeldin's boyhood home along Eutaw Street. Elsewhere in the state, however, middle-class white voters did not support Byrd. Byrd lost by 54.46% to 45.54%. He went on to make unsuccessful bids for the Democratic nominations to the U.S. Senate in 1964 and the U.S. Congress in 1966.|$|E

40|$|In {{the period}} 2003 – 05, law-makers in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK took decisive {{action on the}} {{question}} of the legal status to be afforded to same-sex relationships. At one end of the spectrum, the Canadian Civil Marriage Act 2005 (commonly referred to as Bill C- 38) reformulated the legal definition of marriage as ‘the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others’. At the other end of the spectrum, the Australian Marriage Amendment Act 2004 expressly added the traditional common law formulation of the definition of marriage to the Marriage Act 1961 (Aust) : ‘the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life’. In between these two extremes of full equality-based recognition and non-recognition are the partial <b>separate</b> <b>but</b> (almost) <b>equal</b> recognition approaches of the UK and New Zealand.

25|$|Segregation {{in sports}} in the United States was also a major {{national}} issue. In 1900, just {{four years after the}} US Supreme Court <b>separate</b> <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> constitutional ruling, segregation was enforced in horse racing, a sport which had previously seen many African American jockeys win Triple Crown and other major races. Widespread segregation would also exist in bicycle and automobile racing.

25|$|A {{controversy}} {{dating from}} 1999 {{has been over}} the adoption of civil unions, an institution which grants same-sex couples nearly all the rights and privileges of marriage at the state, but not federal, level. In Baker v. Vermont (1999), the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that, under the Constitution of Vermont, the state must either allow same-sex marriage or provide a <b>separate</b> <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> status for them.

In April 2009 the state legislature overrode governor Jim Douglas's veto to allow same-sex marriage, becoming the first state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage through legislation.

25|$|Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, – This was {{recognized}} as a critical case even before it reached the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Earl Warren, realizing how controversial the case {{would be for the}} public, very much wanted to avoid any dissents in the case. But Reed was the lone hold-out. Other members of the Supreme Court worried about Reed's commitment to civil rights, as {{he was a member of}} the (then) all-white Burning Tree Club in Washington, D.C., and his Kentucky home had an all-white restrictive covenant (a covenant which had led Reed to recuse himself from a civil rights case in 1948). Yet, Reed had written the majority decision in Smith v. Allwright and joined the majority in Sweatt v. Painter, , which barred <b>separate</b> <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> racial segregation in law schools. Reed originally planned to write a dissent in Brown, but joined the majority before a decision was issued. Many observers, including Chief Justice Warren, believed a unanimous decision in Brown was necessary to win public acceptance for the decision. Reed was the last holdout and reportedly cried during the reading of the opinion.|$|E
40|$|The post-Franco “boom” of the “novela femenina,” or “women 2 ̆ 7 s novel,” in Spain has {{generated}} much critical and popular interest. Most feminist criticism, however, tends to read these works in an essentialist fashion, relegating them (just as traditional academia would have done) to the <b>separate</b> (<b>but</b> not <b>equal)</b> category of literature by (and for) women. This conflation {{of many different}} kinds of works, novels in particular, under one generic denomination is a disservice to the multiplicity of interpretations that can and should arise from such varied literary endeavors. ^ This present study undertakes the exploration of one such facet that is often ignored when working solely within the already-established boundaries of “women 2 ̆ 7 s literature”: the influence of the fantastic. Martín Gaite 2 ̆ 7 s fundamental novel, El cuarto de atrás, points to the possible significance of a link between “women 2 ̆ 7 s writing” and the fantastic, particularly as it is defined by Tzvetan Todorov. What these two seemingly disparate literary forms share is a desire to subvert conventional literary paradigms, creating a text that is intentionally ambiguous at every level of interpretation. ^ In this dissertation, various novels by Spanish women writers are examined in terms of their intent to destabilize traditional categories assigned to feminine identity, textuality and sexuality. Although some works from the postwar era (Primera memoria and Nada, for example) hint at this subversive ambiguity, it is most developed in contemporary novels, following the 1978 publication of two revolutionary texts: Cuarto and Tusquets 2 ̆ 7 s El mismo mar de todos los veranos, which inaugurate a new generation of “women 2 ̆ 7 s literature. ” Along with the two other novels included in this study—Alós 2 ̆ 7 s El asesino de los sueños and García Morales 2 ̆ 7 s El silencio de las sirenas—these works are notable for their writerliness, their self-conscious treatment of literary creation, which destablize conventional textuality through the subversive manipulation of fantastic intertexts; as well as through innovative deformations of formal novelistic elements, such as the narrative frame. The imagery of these works also calls into question normative constructions of identity (through “masquerade”) and sexuality (through representations of monstrosity). ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{organized}} discovery {{of how the}} dominant, mainstream white culture dealt {{with the presence of}} Afro-American people who were 2 ̆ 2 unassimilable 2 ̆ 2 and would not accept an assigned role within a society hostile to their presence. A look at the period between the 2 ̆ 2 failure 2 ̆ 2 of Reconstruction and the first significant, enforceable civil rights legislation is revealing. Was there a gap between mediated images of black Americans and real blacks, and if so, what purpose(s) did it serve?^ Two major procedures were used to reveal white American cultural behavior towards the black race: first more than 3, 000 popular and material culture items were classified by genre, described, and presented in chronological order; second, all of the items are combined and analyzed in light of their historical setting. Chapters one through 12 present treatments of blacks in such genres as history books, children 2 ̆ 7 s literature, music, art, toys and games, greeting cards, and kitsch. Chapters 13 through 16 note trans-generic images, conventions, and trends as well as compare black historical events with contemporary culture-images. ^ What results is a uniform pattern of slowing (sometimes altogether stopping) any illusion of black progress. In some generic categories, blacks were virtually reenslaved throughout the time period of this study. In others, the mediated black was at least several generations behind his living, breathing counterpart, himself slowed by the 2 ̆ 2 image lag. 2 ̆ 2 Mediated blacks mocked and belittled themselves until World War II, when, with few exceptions, they virtually disappeared. Blacks 2 ̆ 7 increased social, political, and economic clout made mediated mockery too 2 ̆ 2 controversial, 2 ̆ 2 so they were ignored altogether to avoid upsetting whites. Again the economic imperative of the commercial culture triumphed over any moral imperative. Brown vs. the Board of Education gave blacks some legal escape from these <b>separate,</b> <b>but</b> hardly <b>equal,</b> years. ^ Popular and material culture images today are by no means free of distortion and oversimplification and may never be until more 2 ̆ 2 tools of presentation 2 ̆ 2 are out of exclusively white hands. The discovery of the gap between the mediated and actual black American has subsequently contributed to its closing a significant amount, however. ...|$|R
25|$|On November 18, 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) {{decided that}} the Commonwealth could not deny {{marriage}} rights to gay couples under the state constitution. On February 4, 2004, the SJC followed that ruling with {{a statement saying that}} allegedly <b>separate</b> <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> civil unions, implemented as of late in Vermont, would not pass constitutional muster and that only full gay marriage rights met constitutional guarantees. On May 17, 2004, the ruling took effect and thousands of gay and lesbian couples across the Commonwealth entered into marriage. Opponents of gay marriage subsequently pushed for an amendment to the state constitution that would allow the state to deny marriage rights to gay couples. It was necessary for the amendment to be approved by at least 1/4 of the members present in two consecutive legislative sessions of the Massachusetts legislature, and to receive majority support in a popular referendum. It passed the first legislative session, but was defeated in the second session, receiving less than 1/4 of the votes of the legislators present. As public opinion polls currently indicate majority support for gay marriage among the people of the Commonwealth, {{it is likely that the}} issue is settled in Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|Towards this end, Hamilton {{added to}} the Committee local {{attorney}} Hughes Spalding, chairman of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority, which owned and operated Grady Memorial Hospital. Hamilton and Spalding proposed the <b>separate</b> <b>but</b> <b>equal</b> black facility, in spite of leaders {{in the black community}} pressing for full integration in society. Hamilton saw it as a beginning, but black leaders saw it as being {{out of touch with the}} reality of the times. The Hospital Authority donated the land for the hospital site, adjacent to Grady. Spalding won endorsements from county commissioners of Fulton and DeKalb, as well as the Fulton County Medical Society and area newspapers, which helped promote the concept. By 1949, $1.725 million in funds had been raised, with the remaining funding to come from the state and the Hospital Authority. Ground was broken on February 1, 1950. Named the Hughes Spalding Pavilion, it was dedicated May 29, 1952. Hamilton was named as secretary to the advisory board of trustees. In 1955, Hamilton and black members of Atlanta's legal and medical community organized Foundation for the Advancement of Medical and Nursing Education, with Hamilton as secretary. The foundation raised $10,000. No one applied for the money. Black interns could not serve at Grady. The United States Public Health Service provided $40,000 in surgery grants.|$|E
