40|$|A sliding seismic {{isolator}} that, {{due to its}} sliding property, {{cuts off}} the inertia force acting on the bridge pier is actively being developed. However, some concerns have been expressed about the performance of this isolator under the effect of vertical ground motions. As it is well known, the sliding bearings are velocity and vertical-load dependent; therefore, under the effect of vertical ground motions, the friction coefficient is expected to change greatly, affecting the horizontal earthquake response. In this study, pseudo-dynamic tests and numerical simulations are performed to analyze the effect of vertical seismic loads on the horizontal earthquake response characteristics of this sliding seismic isolator. The isolation system consists of a <b>sliding</b> <b>bearing</b> that generates the friction damping, and of a rubber bearing that generates the restoration force.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Seismic {{performance}} of a symmetrical space frame structure resting on <b>sliding</b> <b>bearing</b> with restoring force device is studied considering all the six degrees of freedom. The sliding support is modeled as a fictitious spring with two horizontal degrees of freedom. In non-sliding phase the horizontal stiffness of <b>sliding</b> <b>bearing</b> is considered as very large whereas it is equal to zero during sliding phase. The El Centro, Turkey and Mexico earthquakes are adopted as the input motion. The response quantities obtained from the analysis are the acceleration, base shear, bending moment and displacement. In this study, {{the response of the}} isolated structure is compared with the response of the structure fixed at the base. Response of the isolation system with restoring force device is also compared with the response of the isolation system without restoring force device. In addition, the effects of coefficient of friction of sliding material, time period of the superstructure and the number of storeys on response of structure are also investigated. It is concluded from the study that the <b>sliding</b> <b>bearing</b> with restoring force device reduces the earthquake response of the structure.
