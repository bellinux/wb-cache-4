5|$|Bill Lear {{distributed}} the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, {{the result of}} which became the Stereo8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track <b>system</b> <b>had</b> faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track <b>system</b> <b>had</b> higher fidelity since the tape speed was double {{the speed of the}} Stereo8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo8 quickly became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by 1966.|$|E
5|$|By August12, the NHC {{reported}} that Tropical Depression Two was near tropical storm intensity after {{a burst of}} deep convection over the center.

Several hours later, the system became disorganized due to increased wind shear. By the afternoon of August13, the <b>system</b> <b>had</b> weakened to a tropical depression and shortly thereafter, degenerated into a non-convective remnant low-pressure area as it failed to maintain convection around the center for 24hours. At this time, the NHC issued their final advisory on the system but noted that there was the possibility of regeneration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract：For {{reduction}} {{of the amount of}} CO 2 emitted from ships, power generation characteristics of two power generation systems consisting of a high-efficiency permanent magnet synchronous generator and diode bridge rictifiers are discussed in this paper. One of the discussed <b>systems</b> <b>has</b> three-phase stator windings, and the other has two sets of three-phase (six-phase) stator windings to reduce pulsation in the electromagnetic torque and DC current. Experimental results reveal that the power generation efficiency of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> six-phase stator windings is higher than that of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> three-phase stator windings for a light load. The maximum power generation efficiency of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> six-phase stator windings is almost {{the same as that of}} the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> three-phase stator windings. For the electromagnetic torque of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> six-phase stator windings, the width of pulsation is about one-fifth compared to the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> three-phase stator windings.

5|$|A trough {{extended}} from the northern Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean in early August. The trough remained nearly stationary, spawning Tropical Storm Bertha in the Gulf of Mexico and a tropical disturbance {{off the coast of}} South Carolina. The weak low pressure area off South Carolina drifted southward, with its associated deep convection increasing in organization on August 4.

5|$|Although the <b>system</b> <b>had</b> a {{partially}} exposed low-level circulation center, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) as the depression {{was likely to}} intensify as it was situated over high sea surface temperatures and in a favorable environment. However, by September4, wind shear quickly increased and dislocated all of the convection associated with the depression {{from the center of}} circulation. This led to the JTWC canceling their TCFA as the environment was no longer favorable for development. The following day, the JTWC declared that the <b>system</b> <b>had</b> dissipated and was no longer a suspect area for tropical cyclone development as the system was virtually stationary off the coast of Vietnam. The JMA, on the other hand, continued to monitor the cyclone as a tropical depression. Although previously declaring that the system dissipated early on September6, the JTWC began monitoring the re-developing system later that day. Convective banding had reformed, wind shear had decreased and the cyclone had less interaction with land as it slowly moved further into the South China Sea. However, late on September8, both agencies declared that the depression had dissipated off the coast of Vietnam.|$|E

Rockwell was contracted to deliver the combat system by 9 September 1993, but was unlikely to do so. ASC's management board voted to issue a default notice to Rockwell as the American company had defaulted on the contract, but was ordered by the Department of Defence to retract the default notice and accept gradual delivery of partially completed versions of the combat system—referred to as 'releases' and 'drops'—until the complete <b>system</b> <b>had</b> been delivered. Sea trials of Collins were unable to commence until Release 1.5 of the combat system software was delivered; because of ongoing delays {{in the provision of}} the software, the early phases of the trials were completed using stand-alone equipment By March 1994, the combat <b>system</b> <b>had</b> become the major area of concern for the submarine project: assembly of the system was almost nine months behind schedule, and at least 20% of the software had not been compiled. The combat system continued to be a problem during the next few years, with progressive drops offering little improvements in performance over the previous version, and the completion date of Release 2—the designation for the full contractual realisation of the combat system software—was continually postponed.|$|E
