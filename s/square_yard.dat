Robins valuation shows the 60 by 30 <b>square</b> <b>yard</b> Town Hall occupying {{the northern part of the}} plot defined by Hill, New and Pinfold Streets. The surveyors' valuation of the site allowed for the construction of a new road across the plot, effectively extending Swallow Street eastward. The total cost of purchasing the full site, minus potential resale values of material saved from demolition of existing buildings, was estimated to be £9500.|$|E
25|$|Many {{sectors of}} the {{industry}} did agree to a programme coordinated by the Metrication Board, with metrication of pre-packaged goods being introduced on a commodity by commodity basis. In 1977 when a carpet retailing chain reneged on an industry-wide agreement to use metric units (carpeting at £8.36 per <b>square</b> <b>yard</b> being much more appealing to the customer than carpeting at £10.00 per square metre), it became necessary {{for the first time}} to use legislation to enforce metrication rather than to rely on a voluntary adoption of the system.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Lincoln's death in 1865, the East Room {{contained}} 24 chairs, four sofas, four tables, eight sets of drapes, eight sets of lace curtains, eight mirrors, and one carpet. All the furniture was in poor shape. During his administration, {{members of the public}} attending the weekly receptions in the room had heavily vandalized the room in seeking souvenirs, ripping down portions of the wallpaper and stealing cords and tassels from the drapes. Someone even cut a <b>square</b> <b>yard</b> from one of the damask drapes. Others took scissors and knives to the carpet, gouging the oak floor beneath, and gilded ornaments were stolen from the mantels.|$|E

25|$|After leaving Anfield in 1892, Everton {{moved to}} Goodison Park on the {{opposite}} side of Stanley Park. Goodison Park was the first major football stadium built in England. Molineux (Wolves' ground) had been opened three years earlier but was still relatively undeveloped. St. James's Park, Newcastle, opened in 1892, was little more than a field. Only Scotland had more advanced grounds. Rangers opened Ibrox in 1887, while Celtic Park was officially inaugurated at the same time as Goodison Park. Everton performed a miraculous transformation at Mere Green, spending up to £3000 on laying out the ground and erecting stands on three sides. For £552 Mr. Barton prepared the land at 4½d a <b>square</b> <b>yard.</b> Kelly Brothers of Walton built two uncovered stands each for 4,000 people, and a covered stand seating 3,000, at a total cost of £1,460. Outside, hoardings cost a further £150, gates and sheds cost £132 10s and 12 turnstiles added another £7 15s to the bill.|$|E
25|$|Because of low tariffs, poor {{collection}} efficiency and overstaffing, many urban utilities do not {{cover the costs}} for operation and maintenance. According to an international survey conducted in 2012, the water tariff in Karachi was among the 20 lowest water tariffs {{in the world in}} a sample of 310 cities. According to this survey, the residential water tariff in Karachi was US$0.09 per m3 for a consumption of 15 m3 per month. The tariff had been raised by 67% in September 2011, in order to pay for an increase of the electricity rates charged to the water utility. This made it the third-highest increase in water tariffs in the world in 2011. According to the Karachi Water and Sewer Board, the unmetered water tariff after the increase was 111 Pakistani Rupees (about US$1.17) for a residences of 100 <b>square</b> <b>yard,</b> corresponding to US$0.08 per m3. For larger residences the flat tariff is much higher. The metered tariff, however, was 71 Rupees per 1,000 gallons, corresponding to about US$0.16 per m3.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{building had}} a harmonious and unadorned prospect, known through Rome's plan by Antonio Tempesta published in 1593, published when the palace was just finished, with seventeen windows and three floors. The facade along Via Alessandrina resembles those of coeval buildings, like Palazzo Ruspoli, built in Via del Corso by Bartolomeo Ammannati. Resulting {{from the union}} of several small houses, the edifice was very long, especially after the addition of another wing at the west end, along Via del Mascherino, sixty years {{after the death of}} Rusticucci in 1603. After this addition, the palace was unanimously described by the coeval city's guides as [...] "lacking grace". Its main front had a monotonous and modest appearance: it was [...] long, with three floors and a mezzanine, twenty-two windows and a rusticated portal. Its area covered [...] To the right of the entrance lay a rectangular yard with three orders, doric, ionic and corinthian.

500|$|Before {{the march}} could begin, Shackleton ordered the weakest animals to be shot, {{including}} [...] the carpenter Harry McNish's cat, Mrs. Chippy, and a pup {{which had become}} a pet of the surgeon Macklin. The company set out on 30 October 1915, {{with two of the}} ship's lifeboats carried on sledges. Problems quickly arose, as the condition of the sea ice around them worsened. According to Hurley the surface became [...] "a labyrinth of hummocks and ridges", in which barely a <b>square</b> <b>yard</b> was smooth. [...] In three days the party managed to travel barely two miles (3.2km), and on 1 November Shackleton abandoned the march; they would make camp and await the break-up of the ice. [...] They gave the name [...] "Ocean Camp" [...] to the flat and solid-looking floe on which their aborted march had ended, and settled down to wait. [...] Parties continued to revisit the Endurance wreck, which was still drifting with the ice a short distance from the camp. [...] More of the abandoned supplies were retrieved until, on 21 November 1915, the ship finally slipped beneath the ice.|$|E

2500|$|Adopting {{the metric}} system was {{discussed}} in Parliament {{as early as}} 1818 and some industries and even some government agencies had metricated, or {{were in the process}} of metricating by the mid 1960s. A formal government policy to support metrication was agreed by 1965. [...] This policy, initiated in response to requests from industry, was to support voluntary metrication, with costs picked up where they fell. In 1969 the government created the Metrication Board as a quango to promote and coordinate metrication. In 1978, after some carpet retailers reverted to pricing by the <b>square</b> <b>yard</b> rather than the square metre, government policy shifted, and they started issuing orders making metrication mandatory in certain sectors. In 1980 government policy shifted again to prefer voluntary metrication, and the Metrication Board was abolished. By the time the Metrication Board was wound up, all the economic sectors that fell within its remit except road signage and parts of the retail trade sector had metricated.|$|E

5000|$|Acre: area of land one chain (four rods) {{in width}} by one furlong in length. As the {{traditional}} furlong could vary in length {{from country to}} country, so did the acre.

2500|$|The {{negotiations}} {{for the land}} for the new cricket ground took place between de Mello and the then Bombay governor Lord Brabourne. De Mello used the name of Antonio Piedade da Cruz, an artist from Goa who was painting Lord Brabourne at the time, {{in order to obtain}} a meeting. The popular story goes that before returning {{at the end of the}} meeting, de Mello asked Lord Brabourne : 'Your excellency, which would you prefer to accept from sportsmen, money for your Government, or immortality for yourself?'. Brabourne chose immortality and the CCI was allotted 90,000 square yards at a price of [...] 13.50 per <b>square</b> <b>yard</b> from land reclaimed in the Backbay reclamation scheme. Messrs. Gregson, Batley and King were appointed the architects of the facility and Shapoorji Pallonji & Co. were awarded the contract for construction.

60|$|It {{was shown}} in the third chapter that on Leith Hill Common, dry earth {{weighing}} at least 7.453 lbs. was brought up by worms to the surface on a <b>square</b> <b>yard</b> {{in the course of}} a year. If a <b>square</b> <b>yard</b> be drawn on a hillside with two of its sides horizontal, then it is clear that only 1/36 part of the earth brought up on that <b>square</b> <b>yard</b> would be near enough to its lower side to cross it, supposing the displacement of the earth to be through one inch. But it appears that only of the earth brought up can be considered to flow downwards; hence 1/3 of 1/36 or 1/108 of 7.453 lbs. will cross the lower side of our <b>square</b> <b>yard</b> in a year. Now 1/108 of 7.453 lbs. is 1.1 oz. Therefore 1.1 oz. of dry earth will annually cross each linear yard running horizontally along a slope having the above inclination; or very nearly 7 lbs. will annually cross a horizontal line, 100 yards in length, on a hill-side having this inclination.|$|E
