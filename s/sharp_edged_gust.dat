The aeroservoelastic system {{is subjected to}} a short time <b>sharp</b> <b>edged</b> <b>gust.</b> The piecewise impulse controller was found to provide both state regulation and phase compensation to the rate limited actuator. The closed loop system is largely insensitive to {{the changes in the}} phase lead transfer function gain, due to the switching action the controller; but sensitive to the changes in the phase lead transfer function damping ratio. The piecewise impulse controller was found to remove steady state error. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} {{evolution}} of gust design criteria in the U. S. particularly {{from the standpoint of}} research that was used in the substantiation for the various versions in the evolution. The mathematical models of airplanes and of atmospheric turbulence and their rationale are described. Emphasis is given to the revisions and refinements made starting in the 1920 's up to the present time. The major steps, beginning with the <b>sharp</b> <b>edged</b> <b>gust</b> formula, are traced through the modified formula specifying ramp-platform gusts and later to one-minus-cosine gusts and finally to criteria for continuous gust analyses. The influence of aircraft design developments on design criteria development needs is also addressed. A brief summary of military criteria is included. Significant discussion is devoted to measurements that have been made, including onboard recordings, to provide an extensive data base of (1) atmospheric turbulence experienced in routine flight operations, (2) specially-instrumented research aircraft measurements to provide atmospheric characterization for various flight and meteorological conditions, and (3) comparisons of measured and calculated aircraft responses in turbulence. Some features of the instrumentation used will be depicted...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{technique is}} formulated, {{in a computer}} program U 2 DIIF, for the solution of flow over an airfoil executing an arbitrary unsteady motion in an inviscid and incompressible medium. The technique extends the well known Panel Methods for steady flow into solving a non-linear unsteady flow problem arising from the continuous vortex shedding into the trailing wake due to the unsteady motion of the airfoil. Numerous case-runs are presented to verify U 2 DIIF computer code against other theoretical and/or numerical methods {{as well as in}} cases where limited experimental data are obtainable in literatures. These case-runs include airfoils undergoing a step change or a modified ramp change of angle-of-attack, airfoils executing harmonic oscillation in pitching and plunging motions and airfoils penetrating a <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> <b>gust.</b> (Author) [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Analytical indicial {{aerodynamic}} {{functions are}} calculated {{for a number}} of trapezoidal wings in subsonic ow, with Mach number 0 : 3 M 0 : 7. The formulation herein proposed extends wellknown aerodynamic theories, which are limited to thin aerofoils in incompressible ow, to generic trapezoidal wing planforms. First, a thorough study is executed to assess the accuracy and limitation of analytical predictions, using unsteady results from two state of the art computational fluid dynamics solvers as cross validated benchmark. Indicial functions are calculated for a step change in angle of attack and for a <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> <b>gust,</b> each for four wing configurations and three Mach numbers. Then, analytical and computational indicial responses are used to predict dynamic derivatives and the maximum lift coefficient following the encounter with a one-minus-cosine gust. It is found that the analytical results are in excellent agreement with the computational results for all test cases. In particular, the deviation of the analytical results from the computational results is within the scatter or uncertainty in the data arising from using two computational fluid dynamics solvers. This indicates the usefulness of the developed analytical theories...|$|R
40|$|Unsteady {{solutions}} for the aerodynamic coefficients of a thin airfoil in compressible subsonic or supersonic flows are studied. The lift, the pitch moment, and pressure coefficients are obtained numerically for the following motions: the indicial response (unit step function) of the airfoil, i. e., a sudden change in the angle of attack; a thin airfoil penetrating into a <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> <b>gust</b> (for several gust speed ratios); a thin airfoil penetrating into a one-minus-cosine gust and sinusoidal gust (a typical gust used in commercial aircraft design); oscillating airfoil; and also {{the interaction of the}} airfoil with a shed (from convection phenomenon) vortex passing under the airfoil, a phenomenon known in literature as AVI (Airfoil Vortex Interaction). The present work uses a numerical approach based on vortex singularity. The numerical model is created by means of the airfoil discretization in uniform segments and the compressible flow vortex singularity is used. The results available in the literature are based on approximated exponential equations, or computed via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Thus, the purpose of this method is to obtain a more accurate computation compared to those of approximated equations, and numerically quite faster compared to those obtained via CFD...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} gust modeling capability in the CFD code FUN 3 D. The gust capability is verified by computing the response of an airfoil to a <b>sharp</b> <b>edged</b> <b>gust.</b> This result is compared with the theoretical result. The present simulations will be compared with other CFD gust simulations. This paper {{also serves as a}} users manual for FUN 3 D gust analyses using a variety of gust profiles. Finally, the development of an Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (ARMA) reduced order gust model using a gust with a Gaussian profile in the FUN 3 D code is presented. ARMA simulated results of a sequence of one-minus-cosine gusts is shown to compare well with the same gust profile computed with FUN 3 D. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is combined with the ARMA modeling technique to predict the time varying pressure coefficient increment distribution due to a novel gust profile. The aeroelastic response of a pitch/plunge airfoil to a gust environment is computed with a reduced order model, and compared with a direct simulation of the system in the FUN 3 D code. The two results are found to agree very well...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Boundary element {{method in}} {{acoustics}} for Neumann boundary condition problems including <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners is investigated. In previous acoustic boundary element method, acoustic pressure and normal velocity {{are the two}} variables at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners. However, the normal velocity at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners is discontinuous due to the indefinite normal vector. To avoid the indefinite normal vector and the discontinuous normal velocity at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners, normal vector of elemental node is defined and applied in the numerical implementation. Then the normal velocity is transformed to velocity which is unique even at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners. Such treatments {{make sure that all}} variables in the acoustic boundary element method are definite. Computational efficiency and accuracy of the new model are demonstrated by three cases of interior acoustic problems for which analytical solutions can be found and one classical exterior acoustic radiation problem. Curvilinear quadrilateral isoparametric elements are applied in the computation. It is found that the numerical results agree with corresponding analytical solutions quite well...|$|R
