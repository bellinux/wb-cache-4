500|$|The Gettysburg farm {{provided}} a few headaches. Democrats chose {{the amount of}} time the Eisenhowers spent at the Gettysburg farm as another way to attack him. Paul M. Butler, head of the Democratic National Committee, called him a part-time president due to his many stays in Gettysburg. When his World War II colleague Bernard Montgomery visited the farm, Eisenhower commented to Montgomery [...] (speaking as military commander to military commander) that he would have fired a subordinate that would initiate Pickett's Charge. Many Southerners saw this as disrespect toward Robert E. Lee, and protested. Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev visited the farm in September 1959, and was [...] "grandfathery" [...] to the Eisenhower grandchildren. David Eisenhower said that Khrushchev was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> guy, he (David) could become a Communist if he did not know better, causing much embarrassment to the Eisenhowers.|$|E

Actor Ed Helms said of the episode, [...] "What the writers did is really fun and creative. It doesn't boil down to passive aggressive little picnic games with a vengeance. There's a lot more going on than that." [...] The episode marked return appearances of former guest stars Amy Ryan as Holly Flax and Idris Elba as Charles Miner. Ryan said she would love the prospect of returning to The Office in future episodes, but that there are currently no plans for such a return: [...] "I think that door [...] will always be open, just because it's <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> party to go to.

In order to keep up his intensity, Vedder traveled into San Francisco and began sleeping in his truck, {{as well as the}} sauna at the recording studio. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "Recording Vs., {{there was a lot more}} pressure on Ed. The whole follow-up. I thought we were playing so well as a band that it would take care of itself... He was having a hard time finishing up the songs; the pressure, and not being comfortable being in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> place." [...] Ament added that [...] "toward the end it got fairly intense" [...] and that the band [...] "tried to make it as uncomfortable for [...] as we could." [...] Eventually the band was able to get [...] "back on track" [...] according to Ament as Vedder was allowed [...] "to get in the space of his songs." [...] The album was finished in May 1993. Vedder later said, [...] "The second record, that was the one I enjoyed making the least... I just didn't feel comfortable in the place we were at because it was very comfortable. I didn't like that at all." ...|$|E
50|$|Fade to Black {{is set in}} the {{advertising}} world, and as <b>such</b> is <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> counterpoint to Stout's Wolfe novel Before Midnight (1955). Whereas the earlier book centres on jealousies within a large and established agency, and a nationwide perfume contest, the Goldsborough book is concerned with a mid-sized boutique agency coping with issues such as idea theft between ad agencies and television spots for the Super Bowl, which was still ten years in the future when Before Midnight was written.|$|R

He told me what the song was about, but in a [...] as well. He just said it was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it". Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats. Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a voyeur and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. [...] "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with 'N Sync and he's <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does."

[...] Gallagher recalled favorable experiences of working with Tarantino for the film: [...] "Pulp Fiction was just being {{in the right place at}} the right time. After The Commitments, a couple of us got representation in LA and it was mostly rubbish. They drive you around to meet about 30 different people, but I was never the Hollywood starlet those people wanted. The only time I ever fitted into anybody's blueprint was with Tarantino. He was the man. Bring on the freaks! Bring out the people, now deemed shells, whose career is over. But he is unique. He's such a wonderful director and <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> bloke.

2500|$|After hearing Vedder's tape, former Mother Love Bone members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament invited Vedder {{to come to}} Seattle to {{audition}} for their new band. They were instantly impressed with his unique sound. At the time, Gossard and Ament {{were working on the}} Temple of the Dog project founded by Soundgarden's Chris Cornell as a musical tribute to Mother Love Bone's frontman Andrew Wood, who died of a heroin overdose at age 24. Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron and newcomer Mike McCready were also a part of the project. The song [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell later said of Vedder that [...] "he sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] Vedder would provide background vocals on several other songs as well. In April 1991, Temple of the Dog was released through A Records. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. Vedder said about the song in the 2009 book Grunge Is Dead; [...] "I really like hearing that song. I feel like I could be real proud of it – [...] because one, I didn't write it, and two, it was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> way to be ushered onto vinyl for the first time. I'm indebted to Chris [...] time eternal for being invited onto that track." [...] On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I heard myself on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on – or the most meaningful.” Vedder and Cornell performed the song together for the last time on October 26, 2014 at the Bridge School Benefit.|$|E

He was less impulsive in his nature than his sister, and did not open his eyes and talk with watering mouth of the seven thousands of pounds a year; but in his quiet way he had weighed and calculated all the advantages to be gained, had even ascertained at what rate he could insure the lady's life, and had made himself certain that nothing in the deed of Lord Ongar's marriage-settlement entailed any pecuniary penalty on his widow's second marriage. Then he had gone down, as we know, to Ongar Park, and as he had walked from the lodge {{to the house and}} back again, he had looked around him complacently, and told himself that the place would do very well.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{stabilization}} of a continuous-time networked multi-input system over a shared communication bus modeled as a fading channel.

We aim at finding the minimum channel capacity rendering state feedback stabilization possible. The main novelty of this work lies {{in the idea of}} scheduling/control co-design which suggests that the transmission scheduling should be designed simultaneously with the controller design. By virtue of <b>such</b> co-design, <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> analytic solution is obtained for the minimum channel capacity required for stabilization given in terms of the topological entropy of the plant. A numerical example is provided to illustrate how the scheduling/control co-design is carried out to stabilize the networked system. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
