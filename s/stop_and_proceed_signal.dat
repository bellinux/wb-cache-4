5000|$|Canada uses {{a signal}} system {{similar to the}} United States' {{signalling}} system, in that signals are either one-, two- or three-headed, and each one can show any of the aspects described above. There are different signal systems for rapid transit and other urban rail systems in Canada. There are also various types of signs that can be placed on a signal mast, which can modify a signal. An [...] "L" [...] plate upgrades any medium-speed signal to limited speed. An [...] "A" [...] plate is indicative of an absolute signal: you cannot pass that signal at all red signals. An [...] "R" [...] plate upgrades a regular all-red signal from a <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>signal</b> to a restricting signal. A [...] "DV" [...] plate makes a slow-speed signal into diverging speed. Note Canadian railways use miles per hour not kilometres per hour, even though road speed limits are in kilometres per hour.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is illegal}} to proceed past an {{alternating}} flashing red (wig-wag) signal at railroad crossings, per the motor vehicle codes of some jurisdictions. However, this same signal indication has a different meaning (<b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>proceed</b> when clear) at HAWK beacons.|$|R
5000|$|In Pennsylvania, {{the only}} vehicle that may pass a stopped school bus {{with the red}} lights {{flashing}} is an emergency vehicle with its flashing lights and siren activated, but only after the emergency vehicle {{has come to a}} complete <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> with due caution for any students embarking or disembarking.|$|R
50|$|According to {{engineer}} of Szklarska's train block signal no.94 shown a red aspect which order to <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>proceed</b> after two minutes with maximum speed of 13 mph (20 km/h).

5000|$|Restricted Speed Signal - This {{class of}} signals is {{displayed}} for trains {{moving into a}} block where a track circuit has been de-energized or does not exist. A [...] "shunted" [...] track circuit indicates either the block is occupied by another train or railcar, or {{there is a problem}} such as a broken rail or flooded track. Where a track is not protected by track circuits that track must be presumed to be occupied. As the name implies this signal requires trains to move at Restricted speed, specifically with the ability to stop short of an obstruction. Restricted speed signals take many forms including Restricted <b>and</b> Restricted <b>Proceed</b> where trains must simply pass the signal at restricted speed <b>and</b> also <b>Stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>Proceed,</b> where a train must come to a complete stop before proceeding at restricted speed. <b>Stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>Proceed</b> has fallen out of favor with most freight railroads due to the fuel and time savings of allowing the trains to not come to a complete stop. This aspect class can be displayed on almost all railroads in North America.|$|R

5000|$|Edward Marsette of Auburn, Washington {{received}} the Medal of Valor in 2007. While {{at home in}} 2006 Marsette heard a loud crash. Upon investigation, he discovered a car had overturned and burst into flames on the street outside his house. Marsette raced to the vehicle and pulled four people to safety, suffering second and third degree burns in the process. As the first police officer arrived, ammunition from a loaded pistol stored in the vehicle began to detonate due to {{the intensity of the}} fire. Despite being badly injured from the burns he'd suffered rescuing the vehicle's passengers, Marsette ran several hundred yards to warn the approaching officer to <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>proceed</b> with caution due to the igniting bullets.|$|R
60|$|Deringham {{seemed to}} find a {{difficulty}} in commencing, {{and there was a}} curious expression in his restless eyes, while once or twice he <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>proceeded</b> somewhat inconsequently. He had made tools of a good many men and befooled the public without any especial scruples, but there was a shred of pride left him, and {{this was the first time}} he had stooped to drag his daughter into his schemes. His story lacked plausibility, and the girl was not deceived, but he was her father, and it was his cause she was asked to further against the man who had humiliated her and dispossessed him. She glanced away from him when he had finished, but her voice was quietly even.|$|R

5000|$|The Reading Railroad used vane signals {{mounted on}} wooden towers. Painted boards (vanes) of various colors were moved into {{position}} to signify danger (<b>stop),</b> caution, <b>and</b> safety (<b>proceed).</b> The vanes were illuminated at night by lanterns.|$|R
50|$|Floyd, an African-American man, {{claimed that}} on February 27, 2008, {{he was walking}} on the path {{adjacent}} to his house in the Bronx, New York. He encountered the basement tenant, also an African-American man, who indicated that he was locked out of his apartment and asked for help because Floyd's godmother owned the building. Floyd then went upstairs to retrieve the key and he retrieved seven to ten keys because he was unsure of the correct key for the basement lock. Floyd and the tenant went to the basement apartment door and started trying the various keys. After trying five or six keys, they found the correct one.However, before they could open the door, three NYPD officers approached them and asked the two men what they were doing, told them to <b>stop,</b> <b>and</b> <b>proceeded</b> to frisk them. The officers asked the men to produce identification and interrogated the two men {{as to whether they}} lived there and what they were doing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{video for}} [...] "I'm Real" [...] begins with Lopez driving down a highway on a motorcycle, passing various smiling children, who stop {{what they are}} doing and run after her. Lopez is also seen at a gas station, where she <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> to walk into the town. Several more people gaze at her as she walks through the town, and she is later seen eating ice cream with children, until she gets back onto her motorcycle and drives back down the highway. A string of children are running after her, <b>and</b> the music <b>stops</b> as she steps up onto a stage set on a hillside; where she goes into a dance break. (These scenes feature Lopez's second husband, Cris Judd, as a back-up dancer.) For the rest of the video, Lopez continues to sing, dance and entertain the crowd on stage as the crowd watch in pleasure. The video also features a cameo appearance by Ja Rule.|$|R

50|$|Chen became {{apprehensive}} that Gu and Wang might {{join their}} forces and attack Xichuan. Chen's brother, the former paramount eunuch Tian Lingzi, {{who had previously}} adopted Wang as a son, suggested {{that he would be}} able to summon Wang to serve under Chen. Chen agreed, and Tian subsequently wrote a letter inviting Wang to serve under Chen. Wang, receiving Tian's summons, initially indicated that he agreed, and he left his family at Dongchuan's capital Zi Prefecture (梓州) with Gu, while he himself headed toward Xichuan's capital Chengdu. However, while Wang was on his way, Chen's subordinate Li Ai (李乂) persuaded Chen that Wang could not be trusted, and Chen tried to stop Wang. Wang, however, would not <b>stop,</b> <b>and</b> he defeated officers Chen sent to <b>stop</b> him <b>and</b> <b>proceeded</b> to Chengdu. Gu then launched an army under Gu Yanhui's command to aid Wang. They put Chengdu under siege, but could not capture it, so they lifted the siege.|$|R
5000|$|As at {{conventional}} signalized crossings, {{the pedestrian}} signals display flashing [...] "don't walk" [...] indications when typical pedestrians {{no longer have}} enough time to cross before the HAWK beacon releases cross traffic. At {{the same time as the}} flashing [...] "don't walk" [...] indication, the HAWK beacon displays an alternating flashing red indication to vehicular traffic (the equivalent of a stop sign). During this interval, vehicles on the roadway must <b>stop,</b> <b>and</b> may <b>proceed</b> after yielding to pedestrians in the crosswalk. When vehicle traffic is about to restart, the pedestrian signal goes to steady [...] "don't walk". Then, the HAWK beacon goes dark and the pedestrian signal remains in [...] "don't walk" [...] mode until the signal is activated by another pedestrian.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} match featured John Cena versus The Big Show in a submission match. The match {{started at}} a slow pace as both men attempted apply submission holds. Big Show gained an early advantage by grounding his opponent with heavy punches, headbutts, and a full nelson. Cena recovered with some attempts of his own, only to have Big Show <b>stop</b> them, <b>and</b> <b>proceed</b> to apply more submission holds. The momentum shifted after Cena avoided an attempt at Big Show's chokeslam, and delivered an Attitude Adjustment. Cena went to apply the STF {{but was unable to}} apply due to Big Show's size. After he slid his opponent to the ropes to wrap his opponent's legs, so he could apply a sleeper hold. After struggling to escape, The Big Show eventually tapped out, thus ending the match.|$|R

40|$|The current {{model for}} cell-to-cell {{movement}} of plant viruses holds that transport requires virus-encoded movement proteins that intimately associate with endoplasmic reticulum membranes. We {{have examined the}} early stages of the integration into endoplasmic reticulum membranes of a double-spanning viral movement protein using photocross-linking. We have discovered that this process is cotranslational <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> in a <b>signal</b> recognition particle-dependent manner. In addition, nascent chain photocross-linking to Sec 61 alpha and translocating chain-associated membrane protein reveal that viral membrane protein insertion takes place via the translocon, as with most eukaryotic membrane proteins, but that the two transmembrane segments of the viral protein leave the translocon and enter the lipid bilayer together...|$|R
40|$|Summary: We {{report a}} rare {{case of a}} large facial microcystic adnexal {{carcinoma}} in an elderly patient who underwent several rounds of excision. The patient was left with a large facial defect and remaining positive margins. The {{decision was made to}} <b>stop</b> further excision <b>and</b> <b>proceed</b> with reconstructive surgery. We show that the patient’s function and quality of life were not impeded despite reconstruction in light of positive margins for tumor. We believe that this case will draw the surgeon’s attention to the possibility of palliative reconstruction in the treatment of a patient with large debilitating facial defects after microcystic adnexal carcinoma excision...|$|R
40|$|Plant viral {{infection}} and spread {{depends on the}} successful introduction of a virus into a cell of a compatible host, followed by replication and cell-to-cell transport. The movement proteins (MPs) p 8 and p 9 of Turnip crinkle virus are required for cell-to-cell movement of the virus. We have examined the membrane association of p 9 {{and found that it}} is an integral membrane protein with a defined topology in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Furthermore, we have used a site-specific photo-cross-linking strategy to study the membrane integration of the protein at the initial stages of its biosynthetic process. This process is cotranslational <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> through the <b>signal</b> recognition particle and the translocon complex...|$|R
30|$|Sequential sensing {{algorithms}} {{are developed}} for OFDM-based hierarchical cognitive radio (CR) systems. Secondary users sense multiple subbands simultaneously for possible spectrum availabilities under hard misdetection constraints to prevent interference {{to the primary}} users. Accounting {{for the fact that}} the sensing time overhead can often be significant, a novel performance metric is introduced based on the effective achievable data rate. An optimization problem is formulated in the framework of optimal stopping problems to maximize the average effective data rate by determining the best time to <b>stop</b> taking samples <b>and</b> <b>proceed</b> to data transmission. A basis expansion-based suboptimal algorithm is developed to reduce the prohibitive complexity of the optimal solution. The numerical results presented verify the efficacy of the proposed approach.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{a former}} {{colleague}} of Gu Yanlang's {{in the imperial}} guards corps, Wang Jian, had seized Lang Prefecture (閬州, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan) and claimed the title of prefect, and was sending the troops under him to raid the nearby regions, but remained in friendly relations with Gu Yanlang. [...] Chen Jingxuan the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) became apprehensive that Gu and Wang might join their forces and attack Xichuan.

40|$|The {{critical}} step facing every decision maker is when to <b>stop</b> collecting evidence <b>and</b> <b>proceed</b> {{with the decision}} act. This {{is known as the}} stopping rule. Over the years, several unconnected explanations have been proposed that suggest nonoptimal approaches can account for some of the observable violations of the optimal stopping rule. The current research proposes a unifying explanation for these violations based on a new stopping rule selection (SRS) theory. The main innovation here is the assumption that a decision maker draws from a large set of different kinds of <b>stopping</b> rules <b>and</b> is not limited to using a single one. The SRS theory hypothesizes that there is a storage area for stopping rules the so-called decision operative space (DOS) and a retrieval mechanism that is used to select stopping rules from the DOS. The SRS theory has shown good fit to challenging data published in the relevant literature...|$|R
5000|$|Early {{that morning}} an unusually long and heavy freight train {{developed}} problems (unofficially a hot box) whilst travelling west from Ogden. This required {{the first section}} of the Pacific Limited which comprised 18 cars headed by SP GS-3 No.4425 to <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> then <b>proceed</b> with caution. The second section, comprising 20 cars headed by SP Mt-4 No.4361 apparently unaware of the problems ahead continued at full speed. At Bagley a siding, 17 miles west of Ogden at 5.14 a.m. in thick fog the mail express plowed into the Pullman car {{at the back of the}} passenger train. The Ogden Standard Examiner reported [...] "The force of the impact sent another sleeping car smashing through the dining car and farther ahead slammed one coach into the wooden coach ahead of it. Cars of the mail express section piled up crossways of the track behind the engine, some of them sliding down the causeway embankment into water. Most of the dead were taken from the rear Pullman car and from the telescoped coach" ...|$|R
