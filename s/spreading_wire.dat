40|$|Abstract—In double {{patterning}} lithography (DPL), overlay errors between two patterning {{steps of the}} same layer translate into CD variability. Since CD uniformity budget is very tight, meeting requirement of overlay control {{is one of the}} biggest challenges for deploying DPL. In this paper, we electrically evaluate overlay errors for back-end-of-line DPL with the goal of studying relative effects of different overlay sources and interactions of overlay control with design parameters. Exper-imental results show the following: 1) the expected electrical impact of overlay in a path is not significant (< 6 % worst-case RC variation) and should be the basis for determining overlay budget requirement; 2) the worst-case electrical impact of overlay in a single line remains a serious concern (up to 16. 6 % RC and up to 50 mV increase of peak crosstalk noise); 3) translational overlay error has the largest electrical impact compared to other overlay sources; and 4) overlay in y direction (x for horizontal metallization) has negligible electrical impact and, therefore, preferred routing direction should be taken into account for overlay sampling and alignment strategies. Design methods for reducing overlay electrical impact in wires are then identified. Finally, we explore positive/negative process options from an electrical perspective and conclude that positive process is preferred.

40|$|Photoluminescence (PL) {{spectra of}} {{oxidized}} porous silicon (PS) samples plotted against photon energy scale on x-axis would have pure Gaussian form or asymmetric form, {{depending on the}} conditions of preparation. At first a pure Gaussian-shape spectrum plotted against photon energy scale on x-axis is analyzed by statistical method {{on the assumption that}} the energy of emitted photon would be considered as a random variable simultaneously affected by two independent factors, namely: the statistical <b>spread</b> of <b>wire</b> width and the fluctuation in barrier height of SiOx/Si structures. Comparison of visual plots and statistic characteristic between three spectra plotted against various variables (confinement energy, logarithmic wire width and wire width) scale on x-axis demonstrates the exact description of the spectrum by Gaussian profile using normal distribution of confinement energy. An expression correlating the PL intensity (the number of emitted photons) to the number of wires and quantum efficiency has been developed. Further this expression has been extended to the case of spectrum having asymmetric form, which corresponds to the emission from both wire and dot nano-structures. Thus, our model permits to calculate the structural and spectroscopic parameters such as proportion of wires and dots, integrated intensity, peak energy position, FWHM and standard deviation.

The {{same is true for}} knowledge about factors influencing the choice for these types of communication. Using survey data collected among 662 respondents, this paper aims to gain more insight into (i) the interaction between F 2 F and electronic contacts, (ii) the influence of information content and relational distance on the choice of the communication mode/service, and (iii) the influence of relational and geographical distance, in addition to various other factors, on the frequency of F 2 F and electronically mediated contacts with relatives and friends. Bivariate correlation analysis indicates that the frequency of F 2 F contacts is positively correlated with that for electronic communication, which points at a generation effect. With respect to the impact of information content and relational distance, we find that such synchronous modes/services as F 2 F and telephone conversations are used more for urgent matters and that asynchronous modes (especially e-mail) become more influential as the relational distance in the social network increases. Finally, ordered probit analyses confirm that both F 2 F and electronic communication frequencies decline with increasing physical and relational distance to the social network members...|$|R

The initial materials used for this experiment were ceramic samples with nominal composition Bi(1. 5) Pb(0. 5) Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O(x) and T(sub c) = 80 K prepared by the ordinary solid-state reaction, and industrial copper wires from 100 to 400 microns in diameter and from 0. 5 to 1 m long.

Aim: This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the analgesic efficacy of continuous presternal bupivacaine infusion through a single catheter after parasternal block following cardiac surgery. Materials and Methods: The total of 40 patients (American Society of Anesthesiologist status II, III), 45 - 60 years old, undergoing coronary - artery bypass grafting were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blind study. A presternal catheter was inserted with continuous infusion of 5 mL/h bupivacaine 0. 25 % (Group B) or normal saline (Group C) during the first 48 postoperative hrs. Primary outcomes were postoperative morphine requirements and pain scores, secondary outcomes were extubation time, postoperative respiratory parameters, incidence of wound infection, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and hospital stay duration, and bupivacaine level in blood. Statistical Methods: Student′s t-test was used to analyze the parametric data and Chi-square test for categorical variables. Results: During the postoperative 48 h, there was marked reduction in morphine requirements in Group B compared to Group C, (8. 6 ± 0. 94 mg vs. 18. 83 ± 3. 4 mg respectively, P = 0. 2), lower postoperative pain scores, shorter extubation time (117 ± 10 min vs. 195 ± 19 min, respectively, P = 0. 03), better respiratory parameters (PaO 2 /FiO 2, PaCO 2 and pH), with no incidence of wound infection, no differences in ICU or hospital stay duration.

This dissertation explores the historical implications of an unprecedented series of libel cases that arose out of false news reports <b>spread</b> by news <b>wire</b> {{services at the}} turn of the twentieth century. The industrialized speed and scale of the news industry, along with growing concern about sensationalism and the value of reputation had created tension in the press' relationship with society at the time the cases arose. The scale of the cases, in which single plaintiffs sued hundreds of newspapers for publishing the same libelous story, raised new challenges for the press and for libel law doctrine. This study argues that through the serial libel cases the press articulated a new legal conception of press freedom that called on courts to tip the analytical balance to be more protective of its social role in using the telegraph to deliver timely news to the public. Moreover, because the cases involved plaintiffs of varying social prominence, from virtually anonymous to world-famous, the cases also offer new insights into how libel plaintiffs' status and identity could influence the legal analysis of protecting reputational rights at a time before libel law prompted constitutional consideration. The study uses an interdisciplinary conceptual framework of the cultural history of journalism and critical legal history to illuminate the role of law and legal consciousness in the social process of regulating the role of journalism in a democratic society. The study examines legal discourse surrounding the cases both inside and outside of courtrooms and newsrooms, drawing on appellate opinions and legal treatises as well as newspaper and trade press coverage of the cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{explosion}} of personal devices that need ubiquitous connectivity is making both wireless and wireline communication experience increasingly {{rapid growth in}} data-rates. Wireless channels have been `fortunate' to see new channels/standards being made available {{over the past decade}} to meet up to multi-Gb/s demands. One such medium is the wideband 60 GHz channel. Wireless mediums, by definition however, are thwarted by multi-path reflection-based inter-symbol interference (ISI) [...] a problem which becomes only worse at higher speeds. For decades, equalizers have been used efficiently to mitigate such interference. However, wireless equalizers in commercial CMOS products are typically implemented in DSP along multi-level modulation schemes like OFDM, which when scaled to Gb/s speeds dissipate substantial power. This is particularly detrimental for handheld/mobile devices with limited battery capacity. To ease the power bottleneck for equalization, this work instead proposes using mixed-signal techniques. As opposed to classic multi-level ADC/DSP design, such techniques are inspired by high-speed chip-to-chip wired communication that advocates the use of simple modulation schemes (such as QPSK) with few comparators. Since wireless channels suffer ISI with longer delay <b>spreads</b> than their <b>wired</b> counterparts, previously developed wireline equalizers cannot be directly ported. This work therefore enables energy-efficient equalizers to cancel extremely long ISI delay spreads. Our first prototype demonstrated a 40 -coefficient complex (I/Q) decision feedback equalizer (DFE) in 65 nm CMOS to enable 10 Gb/s rates over line-of-sight (LOS) 60 GHz channels, while consuming only 14 mW of power. The second prototype in 65 nm low-power (LP) CMOS enables non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel equalization as well, by using a 32 -coefficient receiver feedforward equalizer (FFE) and a longer 100 -coefficient DFE, achieving 3. 5 - 8 Gb/s rates while consuming 20 - 67 mW. While the equalizer prototypes in this dissertation have been targeted towards 60 GHz channels, the techniques enable energy-efficient equalization for long ISI delay spreads for any high-speed wireless or wireline communication link...|$|R
40|$|Very {{large scale}} {{integration}} (VLSI) {{has been a}} central technology for the realization of modern-day systems. The number of components in a VLSI design may run in the billions {{and it continues to}} grow, while the advantages associated with these advances are realized in multiple fields. However, the increased complexity of the designs poses new challenges for today 2 ̆ 7 s electronic design automation. ^ VLSI computer-aided design tools have to address the effects of technology scaling on interconnects. More specifically, interconnect delay has become a dominant factor in modern designs. During the physical design process, placement of the components on a chip and routing of the connections among them are performed, and the final routed wirelength is used as a metric for determining the performance of the design. By minimizing final routed wirelength, power dissipation and interconnect delay can be reduced. ^ The purpose of this Dissertation is to examine the implications of nanometer-scale VLSI technology in the physical design process and to introduce effective approaches to facilitate the overall physical design flow. With this objective, a clustering algorithm, called SafeNet, is developed in the context of VLSI placement, in order to improve both scalability and performance of the placer. The clustering algorithm applies fine clustering of the hypergraphs, thereby preserving the connectivity of the original VLSI circuits and avoiding any significant modification. ^ Moreover, a flat placement algorithm, called PlaceD, is developed as an approach to the wirelength-driven placement problem on application-specific integrated circuits. The algorithm formulates the placement problem as a non-linear constrained optimization problem and applies size scaling in order to minimize the total wire-length of the design, starting with an initial placement obtained using an optimal region-based approach. Simultaneously, the placement algorithm also satisfies various placement constraints. ^ Furthermore, a two-level placement algorithm, called PlaceR, is proposed to address the routability-driven placement problem. This placement algorithm estimates the routed wirelength during global placement using wire density. After the routed wirelength inside multiple regions is estimated, the algorithm incorporates the routability information into an objective function for the global placement in order to guide the placement process. PlaceR also combines a method for the <b>spreading</b> of <b>wire</b> density with clustering, pin congestion control, and size scaling. In this way, the placer minimizes wire congestion and the final routed wirelength of the design. ^ Finally, a post-processing algorithm for placement, called Allagi, is developed to further improve the placement quality. The algorithm formulates the placement problem as a linear program and reduces the total routed wirelength by identifying congested regions in the design. Circuit components that have been placed in the congested areas of the design are relocated to regions that are optimal in terms of minimizing wirelength. ^ The path for the minimization of congestion and improvement in routability is a necessary step for achieving design optimization and enhancing performance. Empirical results show that the proposed methods efficiently reduce the wirelength and improve the routability of the designs. Each of these methods can be incorporated in the overall physical design flow to improve the placement solution and facilitate the operation of a router. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} {{microchannel plates}} {{have been damaged}} in the beam region. After an attempt to revive the plates by baking, the gain of the central 30 mm is still reduced by approximately a factor of three. The plates {{appear to have been}} irreversibly damaged by being operated {{for an extended period of}} time at high gain with high debuncher beam currents. A new set of microchannel plates has been installed in the monitor. Because of a production error, the gap between the microchannel plate output and the anode wire plane was set at 15 mm instead of 3 mm. The high voltage divider allowed a maximum of 170 volts to be applied across this gap. Under the conditions at which the Monitor was being operated, the distribution of collected electrons from a single micro channel was spread over a large area. A collimated UV light source which had a FWHM of 3 mm produced a profile with a FWHM of 22 mm with an amplifier threshold supply voltage of 1. 0 V and FWHM of 9 mm with a threshold voltage of 5. 0 V. See Figure 1. When new microchannel plates were installed, the anode gap was reduced to 9. 5 mm, and the gap voltage was increased to 760 V, the results shown in Figure 2 were obtained. The width of the distribution depends strongly on the plate gain and discriminator threshold. Analog readout with a SWIC scanner eliminates the dependence of width on plate gain. Figure 3 shows two scanner profiles with plate gains differing by a factor of 64. The anode wire plane allows a significant fraction of the charge to leak through into the low field region behind the plane and <b>spread</b> over several <b>wires</b> before being captured by the wires. This produces broad tails on the width distribution. Replacing the wire plane with strip electrodes etched on a printed circuit board eliminates this problem, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 5 shows scanner profiles with wire anodes and with P. C. strip anodes. The intrinsic resolution of the detector appears to be less than one element width (2. 2 mm), so the P. C. anode will have 8 elements instead of the previous 32. This will provide more useful information in measuring 1 / 2 {pi} beams from the booster...|$|R
