5|$|In 1922, German anti-Semitic theorist Alfred Rosenberg in {{his primary}} {{contribution}} to Nazi theory on Zionism, Der Staatsfeindliche Zionismus ("Zionism, the Enemy of the State"), accused German Zionists {{of working for}} a German defeat and supporting Britain and {{the implementation of the}} Balfour Declaration, in a version of the stab-in-the-back myth. Adolf Hitler took a <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> in some of his speeches from 1920 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Robert Hastings {{was one of}} the few SPR {{researchers}} to defend Price. Price's literary executor Paul Tabori and Peter Underwood have also defended Price against accusations of fraud. A <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> was made by Ivan Banks in 1996. Michael Coleman in an SPR report in 1997 wrote Price's defenders are unable to rebut the criticisms convincingly.|$|E
5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{expansion}} of the British Empire, a <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> was also gaining popularity in Britain. An Anglicised interpretation of Islamic architecture is exemplified by the Brighton Royal Pavilion, completed in 1823, and the Sezincote House, completed a few years earlier. Both these buildings drew heavily on the Islamic motifs, which were later to be evident at the Vorontsov Palace and were new and novel designs {{at the time of the}} Prince's visit to England.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{returned}} to Pomona, California and {{stayed at the}} home of science fiction writer Randall Frakes, where he wrote the draft for The Terminator. Cameron's influences included 1950s science fiction films, the 1960s fantasy television series The Outer Limits, and contemporary films such as The Driver (1978) and Mad Max 2 (1981). To translate the draft into a script, Cameron enlisted his friend Bill Wisher, who had a <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> to storytelling. Cameron gave Wisher scenes involving Sarah Connor and the police department to write. As Wisher lived far from Cameron, the two communicated ideas by recording tapes of what they wrote by telephone. Frakes and Wisher would later write the US-released novelization of the movie.|$|E
5|$|Lemaire {{has since}} re-entered retirement, and was {{replaced}} by former Florida head coach Peter DeBoer on July 19, 2011. The team showed greater offensive prowess during the 2011–12 season, employing a more aggressive forecheck centered on Ilya Kovalchuk. Under DeBoer's system, according to Lamoriello, the Devils' defenseman were often sent into the offensive zone to apply pressure on the opposing team's defense. After DeBoer's dismissal, Adam Oates had a <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> improving the Devils' offense, investing on the versatility of the forwards.|$|E

5|$|On 12 February 2014, Channel 5 {{confirmed}} to Broadcast magazine {{that it was}} in the process of filming a similar documentary, provisionally titled Living on the Social, in which individuals and families would discuss their lives on welfare. The Hull Daily Mail reported in March that Channel 5 were looking at Hull as a potential location for the series, but that the city council had urged residents not to participate. The Yorkshire Post reported a <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> to residents in Bridlington in April. Love Productions also announced plans for Famous, Rich and Hungry, a two-part documentary for the BBC's Sport Relief that would see celebrities spending time with families experiencing food poverty in order to explore the issue.|$|E
5|$|We tried a <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> for The Little Shop of Horrors, {{dropping}} {{in and out}} of various downtown dives. We ended up at a place where Sally Kellerman (before she became a star) was working as a waitress, and as Chuck and I vied with each other, trying to top each other’s sardonic or subversive ideas, appealing to Sally as a referee, she {{sat down at the table}} with us, and the three of us worked out the rest of the story together.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{operational}} doctrine {{developed by the}} RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon {{the effectiveness of their}} individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise {{the operational}} lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E

5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination. Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer. Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. A <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> has also been studied for the United States.|$|E
5|$|John P. Costas, {{a former}} bond trader and co-head of Fixed income at Credit Suisse First Boston {{and head of}} Fixed Income Trading at Union Bank of Switzerland in 1998, was {{appointed}} CEO of UBS's investment banking division, which originated in SBC's Warburg Dillon Read division and was renamed UBS Warburg in December 2001. In an attempt {{to break into the}} elite bulge bracket of investment banks, in which UBS then had little success while rival Credit Suisse was establishing itself as a major player on Wall Street with the acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 2000, Costas shifted the growth strategy from acquiring entire firms to hiring individual investment bankers or teams of bankers from rival firms. Costas had followed a <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> in building out the UBS fixed income business, hiring over 500 sales and trading personnel and increasing revenues from US$300million in 1998 to over US$3billion by 2001.|$|E
5|$|Malta had {{organised}} the Consulato del Mare (Consulate of the Sea) for {{the first}} time on 1 September 1697 per initiative of Grandmaster Perellos. At the consulate it was decided that four merchants familiar enough with maritime procedures shall be appointed consuls to administer justice, on <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> to Barcellona and Messina. Perellos had established foreign relations between Malta and Russia in 1698, {{for the first}} time, exactly a century before the Order's expulsion from Malta. During his grandmastership the coastal fortifications of Malta were strengthened by the construction of batteries, redoubts, and entrenchments. He also was the driving force behind the third rate squadron of the order which was eventually inaugurated in 1705. In 1707 he entrusted Romano Carapecchia with the reorganization of the drainage system in Valletta.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new index for the {{relevance}} of terms extracted from domain corpora. We call it term frequency, disjoint corpora frequency (tf-dcf), and {{it is based on}} the absolute term frequency of each term tempered by its frequency in other (contrasting) corpora. Conceptual differences and mathematical computation of the proposed index are discussed in respect with other <b>similar</b> <b>approaches</b> that also take the frequency in contrasting corpora into account. To illustrate the efficiency of the tf-dcf index, this paper evaluates the application of this index and other <b>similar</b> <b>approaches.</b> I...|$|R
5|$|On 3 August 1936, Charles de Chambrun, French {{ambassador}} to Italy, presented the French government's non-intervention plan; Galeazzo Ciano promised to study it. The British, however, accepted {{the plan in}} principle immediately. The following day, it was put to Konstantin von Neurath, {{the foreign minister of}} Nazi Germany by André François-Poncet. The German position was that such a declaration was not needed, but discussions could be held on preventing the spread of the war to the rest of Europe, so long as the USSR was present. It was mentioned at the meeting of the French with Neurath that both countries were already supplying the parties in the war, France the Republicans and Germany the Nationalists. A <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> was made by the French to the Soviet Union. On 6 August, Ciano confirmed Italian support in principle. Despite a Pravda claim that 12,145,000 roubles had already been sent by Russian workers to Spain, the Soviet government similarly agreed in principle, so long as Portugal was included, and so long as Germany and Italy stopped aid immediately.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts in}} Malaysia {{have taken a}} <b>similar</b> <b>approach</b> in {{defining}} the meaning of religious practice under Article 11 of the Malaysian Constitution. Furthermore, they have also consulted religious texts to determine what type of acts might constitute religious practices. In Halimatussaadiah v. Public Service Commission, Malaysia (1992), the appellant claimed she had been wrongfully dismissed from her employment due to her refusal to comply with employment conditions that prohibited any attire that covered a female public servant's face while on duty. According to the appellant, this contravened her right to religious practice on grounds that the wearing of the purdah was part of her religious practice as a Muslim. However, the court disagreed and held that the purdah was not considered a religious practice as {{it was not a}} requirement under Islam since there was no express mention of such a requirement in the Quran.|$|E
5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing more {{flexibility}} in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a <b>similar</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|E
