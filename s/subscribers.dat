5000|$|The {{differentiation}} between home network and visited network is technically {{given by the}} type of <b>subscriber</b> entry in a specific network. If a <b>subscriber</b> has no entry in the home <b>subscriber</b> register of the network (e.g. home location register (HLR) in GSM networks or local customer database in WLANs), the required <b>subscriber</b> data must first be requested by the visited network e.g. from the <b>subscriber's</b> home network in order that the <b>subscriber</b> can be authenticated and any authorization for using the network services can be checked. The [...] "visiting" [...] <b>subscriber</b> acquires an entry in a user database of the visited network (e.g. visitor location register (VLR)) and the authorized network services are enabled. For the roaming procedure in practice, the possibility of assigning the <b>subscriber</b> data is always indispensable in order that authentication, authorization and billing of the <b>subscriber</b> can be performed in the corresponding network. Thus, the term roaming is not linked to a specific network standard, but rather to the type of <b>subscriber</b> entry in the home <b>subscriber</b> register of the mobile radio network. If a <b>subscriber</b> can use their personal service profile, which they use in the home network, in the visited network as well, this is also referred to as Global Service Roaming Capability.|$|R
