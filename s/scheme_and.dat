After that, we provide Clifford type theorems for association <b>schemes</b> <b>and</b> their algebraic fusions...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{characterization}} of the general relation between linear multisecret-sharing <b>schemes</b> <b>and</b> error-correcting codes is presented. A bridge between linear multisecret-sharing threshold <b>schemes</b> <b>and</b> maximum distance separable codes is set up. The information hierarchy of linear multisecret-sharing schemes is also established. By making use of the bridge several linear multisecret-sharing threshold schemes based on Reed-Solomon codes, generalized Reed-Solomon codes, Bossen-Yau redundant residue codes are described, which can detect and correct cheatings. The relations between linear multisecret-sharing threshold <b>schemes</b> <b>and</b> some threshold <b>schemes</b> for single-secret sharing are pointed out...|$|R

5|$|At Swansea, the Tennant Canal {{could be}} relinked to the Prince of Wales Dock, and hence to the River Tawe, {{which has become}} a large marina since the {{construction}} of a tidal barrage. This could then provide a link to a restored Swansea Canal. Associated British Ports, who run Swansea Docks, rejected the idea of a canal link in 1997, but since then the Prince of Wales Dock has become the subject of a regeneration <b>scheme,</b> <b>and</b> a route for the canal has been reserved in the planning document. The feasibility of this <b>scheme</b> <b>and</b> a possible route was investigated in a report by the engineers W. S. Atkins published in 2003. A report for Natural Resources Wales by Trilein Ltd. recommended a range of initiatives to better connect the urban areas of the city to the more rural east of the county, including Crymlyn Bog. The reconnection of the Tennant Canal to the Prince of Wales Dock was again outlined in that report.|$|E

5|$|Building on {{his late}} 1950s {{drawings}} of comic strips characters, Look Mickey marks Lichtenstein's first full employment of painterly techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations {{of pop culture}} and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual imagery. In this, Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing {{to the work of}} artists today. Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book, showing Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck during a fishing mishap. However, he makes significant alterations to the original source, including modifying the color <b>scheme</b> <b>and</b> perspective, while seeming to make statements about himself.|$|E

Menage claimed ignorance of the first agreement between King, Remington and Innes and asserted that he had purchased the property outright from the two. After a lengthy trial in Minnesota District Court, Menage lost and was ordered to return the land to King along with all proceeds from the development of the land. Menage appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court in 1886, however the lower court's decision was upheld.|$|E
