This year has been unbelievable. I've been cheered in ballparks all over the country. People not only showed me their kindness, but more importantly, they {{demonstrated}} their {{love of the game}} of baseball. I give my thanks to baseball fans everywhere. Tonight, I want to make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how I feel. As I grew up here, I not only had dreams of being a big league ballplayer, but also of being a Baltimore Oriole. For all of your support over the years, I want to thank you, the fans of Baltimore, {{from the bottom of my}} heart. This is the greatest place to play." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah! I was <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> {{more about}} it than the old tutor man. You always were his little {{sweetheart}} before poor little Madam came in the way, and he would tell you anything near his heart. Could you not have stopped him?" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. MOUNTCALM-VILLIERS I'm {{not quite}} <b>sure,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> that I take well by flashlight.|$|E
60|$|JOANNA (summing up). But we are <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> and it {{you don't}} tell us--quod.|$|E
6000|$|... "Glad to hear it. But I say, my {{prompting}} {{was to look}} on and see {{you take}} the wrong turning, wear out Garth's patience, and lose the best opportunity of your life--the opportunity which you made some rather difficult effort to secure. You can guess the feeling which raised that temptation in me--I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that the satisfaction of your affections {{stands in the way}} of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O yes, Fred," [...] said Henrietta, [...] "to be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> that. <b>You</b> {{have heard}} how mamma {{came home from}} India with General St. Leger and his little boy and girl. But by the by, mamma, what became of their mother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you dare," [...] said Edith. [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> {{it as well}} as he did. And anyway, I {{was certain}} of it myself. I picked up a copy of last week's paper in a lunch-basket on the beach, and hid it from Mr. Borus. I didn't want to hurt his feelings." ...|$|R
5000|$|After Will {{complains}} [...] "Is that all?" [...] To which Crowley replies [...] " [...] Um...it {{seems to}} be...Listed your training, mentioned a few achievements, made <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> which {{end of an}} arrow is the sharp part...decided on your new name...I think that's..." [...] "Of course! You have to have your Silver... don't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{are quite}} <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> between whom the love lies now--eh?' Ethelberta {{asked in a}} sarcastic whisper of Lord Mountclere.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> a {{great many}} things," [...] exclaimed Winterbourne, taking him by the hand. [...] "How is your {{education}} coming on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Harold, {{you know}} nothing of all this {{intricate}} business; and as to these chemical agencies, I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> nothing about them." ...|$|E
60|$|L. If I did, {{it would}} not make me <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> too, May: but I don't.|$|R

6000|$|... "'Find {{the extra}} coffee-cup, {{and you can}} rest in peace.' Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> what it means?" [...] I asked him earnestly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shouldn't {{have gone}} in {{for this kind of}} thing if I hadn't thought I was <b>sure.</b> <b>You</b> <b>know</b> how much you owe me, don't you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{do not say}} that,' {{replied the}} child, 'for if ever anybody was true at heart, and earnest, I am. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> I am.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Ingleby {{would have}} spoken, but Sewell {{held up his}} hand. [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how tight the place is, Tomlinson. If you'll listen I'll try to show you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> the Hoggarties, Edmund?--the {{thirteen}} red-haired girls--the nine graces, {{and four}} over, as poor Clanboy {{used to call}} them. Poor Clan!--a cousin of yours and mine, Mr. Titmarsh, and sadly {{in love with me}} he was too. Not remember them all now, Edmund?--not remember?--not remember Biddy and Minny, and Thedy and Widdy, and Mysie and Grizzy, and Polly and Dolly and the rest?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how {{on earth}} can that be?" [...] his friend asked. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what <b>you</b> are saying? Is your head quite clear, old friend?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, dear, I am almost <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> have <b>known</b> {{something}} {{all along}} that would have proved Captain Mervyn was innocent, and you have not said it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Marie," [...] {{said she}} to her cousin, on the Saturday evening, [...] "I {{am in the}} {{greatest}} distress, pray help me, dearest. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what ails me." ...|$|E
6000|$|The logic here {{seemed a}} little close; but Lord Lambeth, advised of a compliment, found his natural modesty close at hand. “I’m <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{a great deal more}} than I do.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Barney, are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the way?" [...] {{questioned}} Randy, as {{all came}} to a halt for a moment to turn their backs to the wind and catch their breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> must <b>know</b> {{more about}} that than I do. I'll like it first-rate if you could, for I--well, to be plain, I like you." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Hey Mr. DJ, put {{a record}} on... Hi, it's Madonna. You've {{probably}} {{been hearing about}} my new record, 'Music', for a while. Well, I {{just wanted to make}} <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> that the single is gonna drop very soon. I worked on it with a French guy named Mirwais, and he is the shit. The album will be released worldwide on September 19, and I hope you like my music." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well deserved, I am confident,' said Logan; 'and now <b>you</b> are <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{exactly what}} <b>you</b> have to do, as I have explained?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{think we}} have covered about half the distance, Jack," [...] was the reply of the young driver. [...] "Still, I'm not <b>sure.</b> <b>You</b> <b>know</b> a boxsled isn't like an auto--it doesn't carry a speedometer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay,' {{returned}} the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his; 'you have more fortitude than this, I am <b>sure.</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> this young lady, sir?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> are <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> my voice," [...] he said, with {{affected}} gayety. [...] "There {{were two}} {{others in the}} hollow with me that night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks as}} if <b>you</b> didn't <b>know</b> Lance yet; I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> {{altogether}} <b>know</b> Evelyn. Anyhow, I saw her and stopped the thing. I think she got a bad jolt when I {{told her about the}} punt." ...|$|R
