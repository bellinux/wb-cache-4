6000|$|Handing {{his mate}} the twenty dollars, Joe went at a sharp gait toward Blacktown, and Bill <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of the shoulders: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pythagoras, old compeer," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of {{his broad}} shoulders, [...] "what {{would you take}} to be walking {{at this moment in}} that man's shoes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It cost {{me three}} guineas," [...] poor Frank <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> and a sigh, [...] "and that Covent Garden scoundrel gives no credit: {{but she took}} the flowers;--eh, Bagnigge?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] <b>said</b> Ludlow <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug.</b> He added, after a moment, [...] "But I don't {{know that}} I blame her. Nothing {{would have stopped}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was {{something}} in his manner that made me think {{he was about to}} concoct a story that would satisfy our curiosity," [...] <b>said</b> Louise <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, the old Bardi blood!" [...] <b>said</b> Cennini, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug.</b> [...] "I {{shall not}} be {{surprised}} if this business shakes her loose from the Frate, as well as some others I could name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} hard on him," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of his wide shoulders, [...] "to die just {{when he was on}} the point of getting his discharge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{the region}} of taste, Miss Effingham," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of the jaw, if such a member can shrug; [...] "and I do not wonder at finding you here." ...|$|E
60|$|The Father of the Marshalsea <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> {{of modest}} self-depreciation, 'Oh! You {{might be like}} me, my dear Frederick; you might be, if you chose!' and forbore, in the magnanimity of his strength, to press his fallen brother further.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry, but it can't be helped," [...] <b>said</b> Merril, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of his {{shoulders}} which seemed to suggest that his patience was becoming exhausted. [...] "The conditions laid down must be carried out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see!" [...] <b>said</b> Waldron, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug.</b> [...] "It is {{my friend}} Professor Challenger," [...] and amid {{laughter}} he renewed his lecture {{as if this was}} a final explanation and no more need be said.|$|R
6000|$|... "The truth," [...] <b>said</b> Arsenio, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug.</b> [...] "Any man who {{wilfully}} abides in {{the services}} of Condillac"--and instinctively {{he lowered his voice}} lest the Captain or the Marquise should be within earshot--, [...] "is excommunicate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug,</b> [...] "it {{will be all}} right; {{only you}} had better lunch here, that's all, because I want to start early, and go to an old woman's {{at the other end}} of Honham about some fuchsia cuttings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For myself," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug,</b> [...] "I am not sorry. I {{found it}} very interesting, but of late those {{feelings}} of which I have told you have taken hold of me. I have felt as though a terrible shadow were brooding over the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{pass before}} me," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> and a gesture upward {{of the open}} hands. [...] "It was not always so, sir, but times change. It was not so when the sword was in the scale, young gentleman, and {{the virtues of the}} soldier might sustain themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As you did yourself, milor?" [...] she <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> contemptuous <b>shrug</b> of the shoulders, {{thinking}} of his blunder, of the catastrophe which he all but precipitated, and which her more calm diplomacy had perhaps averted.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am mad, Percy," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> self-deprecating <b>shrug</b> of the shoulders, [...] "gone {{crazy with}} grief, I suppose, or I shouldn't talk of asking your help, of risking {{your life in}} my cause." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{since all}} are satisfied, so be it," [...] <b>said</b> Gaubert, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug.</b> [...] "I sought {{to do the}} best for my principal. As it is, I wash my hands of all responsibility, and by all means let us engage, sirs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is painful}} waiting {{even for a}} short time, when one's empty stomach reproaches him," [...] little Frenchie <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of his shoulders, and the man stood irresolute while I might have counted ten, after which he wheeled about suddenly, and entered the house saying as he did so: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of {{his wide}} shoulders, [...] "you are {{suffering}} from vapors, my dear Editha ... or you would grant me more {{knowledge of how to}} conduct mine own affairs.... Do you remember, perchance, that the bulk of Sue's fortune will be handed over to her this day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{that is very}} well," [...] little Frenchie <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of the shoulders; [...] "but {{before the}} last of the army has gone muskets may serve us in good stead, and even though the need does not arise, it is better we should be prepared, than taken at a {{disadvantage}} which might cost our people dearly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish Messer Bartolommeo {{would pay}} me to doctor his gouty Latin," [...] <b>said</b> Macchiavelli, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug.</b> [...] "Did {{he tell you}} about the pay, Ser Ceccone, or was it Melema himself?" [...] he added, looking at the notary <b>with</b> <b>a</b> face {{ironically}} innocent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your solemnity {{will allow}} some quarter to playful fancy, I hope," [...] <b>said</b> Cei, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug,</b> [...] "else what becomes of the ancients, whose example you {{scholars}} {{are bound to}} revere, Messer Pietro? Life was never anything but a perpetual see-saw between gravity and jest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Personally I {{never want}} to set eyes on Sobber again," [...] <b>said</b> Dick, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of his broad shoulders. [...] "The idea of {{introducing}} that deadly snake into the school was the limit. Why, {{half a dozen of}} us might have been bitten instead of only poor Pell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has been}} like this {{the best part of}} the day," [...] Hebert <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of the shoulders. [...] "We put his bread and water right under his nose. He ate and he drank, and I suppose he slept. But except for a good deal of swearing, he has not spoken to any of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How blind you are, my dear Editha," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of {{his broad}} shoulders. [...] "Nay! an I mistake not, {{in that case}} {{there will be some}} strange surprises for you within the next three months. I pray you try and curb your impatience until then, and to bear with the {{insolence}} of a serving wench, 'Twill serve you well, mine oath on that!" [...] he added significantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} be so bitter against yourself, Fitz Hamilton," [...] little Frenchie <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of the shoulders. [...] "It seems certain that we of {{ourselves}} can gain no information whatsoever concerning Saul Ogden, else would we have come upon him ere this. We must content ourselves in patience so far as may be, believing that the Jerseyman will sooner or later come upon the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Joyful after a sour and pious fashion," [...] <b>said</b> Tito, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug.</b> [...] "But, in truth, {{those who}} are left behind in Florence have little cause to be joyful: it seems to me, the most {{reasonable}} ground of gladness {{would be to have}} got out of Florence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is a sad}} character," [...] <b>said</b> the Marquess, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug.</b> [...] "William, I {{would advise}} you to be {{cautious}} of his acquaintance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just your affectionate blessing, and you're very sorry," [...] <b>said</b> Mr. O'Mahony, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug.</b> [...] "That's {{the kind}} of thing, I should say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is to my {{mind that}} we were wise {{to get all the}} sleep possible," [...] little Frenchie <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of the shoulders. [...] "A good soldier should be able to sleep {{anywhere}} and at any time, and it is his duty to take advantage of every opportunity to rest, in order that he may be the better able to undergo fatigue when it becomes necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It matters little, Macumazahn," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of {{his great}} shoulders, [...] "for of this I am sure, that I have played my part with the People of the Axe and to stop among them would have meant my death, who am a man betrayed. What do I care who love none and now have no children? Still, {{it is true that}} I might have fled to Natal with the cattle and there have led a fat and easy life. But ease and plenty I do not desire who would live and fall as a warrior should.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{marriage}} {{then was}} pure expediency, Gilda," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of the shoulders. [...] "My father, whose {{differences with the}} Stadtholder were reaching their acutest stage, had need {{of the influence of}} Marnix de St. Aldegonde; my marriage with Walburg de Marnix was done in my father's interests and went sorely against my heart ... it is meet and natural that she herself should have severed a tie which was one only in name. A year hence from now, the law grants me freedom to contract a new marriage tie; my love for you, Gilda, is unchanged." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' <b>said</b> he, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> and <b>a</b> smile, 'I wish {{some good}} angel would {{influence}} my {{friend in the}} right direction. I rashly promised his mother and sister in Norfolk to see it done, and he promised them {{that he would do}} it. But I suppose he never will.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, then,' <b>said</b> Herbert <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> almost of despair, 'then {{begins the}} weary tramp back. One by one {{drop off the}} truisms, and the Grundyisms, and the pedantries, and all the {{stillborn}} claptrap of the marketplace sloughs off. Then one can seriously {{begin to think about}} saving one's soul.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Catch me {{running errands}} for a jackanapes like that," [...] <b>said</b> Boots, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> contemptuous <b>shrug,</b> turning away, and {{brushing}} at his shoe.|$|R
