2500|$|The French Pythagorean and Rosicrucian alchemist, Francois Jollivet-Castelot (1874-1937), {{established}} a hylozoic esoteric school which combined the insight of <b>spagyrics,</b> chemistry, physics, transmutations and metaphysics.

25|$|Spagyrists of the 20th century, Albert Richard Riedel and Jean Dubuis, merged Paracelsian alchemy with occultism, {{teaching}} laboratory pharmaceutical methods. The schools they founded, Les Philosophes de la Nature and The Paracelsus Research Society, popularized modern <b>spagyrics</b> {{including the}} manufacture of herbal tinctures and products. The courses, books, organizations, and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a New Age medicinal practice.|$|R
5000|$|In ancient alchemy, a protoscience {{that contributed}} to the {{development}} of modern chemistry and medicine, alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques, theory, terminology, and experimental methods. Sublimation was used to refer to the process in which a substance is heated to a vapor, then immediately collects as sediment on the upper portion and neck of the heating medium (typically a retort or alembic), but {{can also be used to}} describe other similar non-laboratory transitions. It is mentioned by alchemical authors such as Basil Valentine and George Ripley, and in the Rosarium philosophorum, as a process necessary for the completion of the magnum opus. Here, the word sublimation is used to describe an exchange of [...] "bodies" [...] and [...] "spirits" [...] similar to laboratory phase transition between solids and gases. Valentine, in his Triumphal Chariot of Antimony (published 1678) makes a comparison to <b>spagyrics</b> in which a vegetable sublimation can be used to separate the spirits in wine and beer. Ripley uses language more indicative of the mystical implications of sublimation, indicating that the process has a double aspect in the spiritualization of the body and the corporalizing of the spirit.

50|$|Frater Albertus Spagyricus (Dr. Albert Richard Riedel) born May 5,(1911-1984); {{founder of}} the Paracelsus Research Society in Salt Lake City, which later evolved into the Paracelsus College. Based on the Paracelsian concept of three essentials, Body, Soul and Spirit, Frater Albertus {{developed}} a system of teaching alchemical concepts using the <b>spagyric</b> technique of separation and cohobation. The unique graduated courses allowed students to explore aspects of the vegetable, mineral and animal kingdoms in an understandable and accessible way. After his death in 1984, the college ceased operations in the United States but continued {{to carry on the}} tradition in Australia. Frater Albertus {{had a profound effect on}} the way Alchemy and particularly the <b>Spagyric</b> method was disseminated and understood in the mid to late 20th century. His works were translated into many languages. He was a rosicrucian (an AMORC member).|$|E
5000|$|A <b>spagyric</b> [...] is an herbal {{medicine}} produced by alchemical procedures. These procedures involve fermentation, distillation, and extraction of mineral components from the ash of the plant. These processes were {{in use in}} medieval alchemy generally for the separation and purification of metals from ores (see Calcination), and salts from brines and other aqueous solutions.|$|E
5000|$|The word {{comes from}} Ancient Greek σπάω spao [...] "to draw out" [...] and ἀγείρω ageiro [...] "to gather". It {{is a term}} {{probably}} first coined by Paracelsus. In its original use, the word <b>spagyric</b> was commonly used synonymously with the word alchemy, however, in more recent times {{it has often been}} adopted by alternative medicine theorists and various techniques of holistic medicine.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the <b>spagyric</b> remedy in turn relies upon the three {{cardinal}} principles of alchemy, termed as salt, sulfur, and mercury. [...] "The basis of matter was the alchemical trinity of principles - salt, sulfur, and mercury. Salt was the principle of fixity (non-action) and in-combustibility; mercury was the principle of fusibility (ability to melt and flow) and volatility; and sulfur was the principle of inflammability." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spagyric</b> most {{commonly}} {{refers to a}} plant tincture to which has also been added the ash of the calcined plant. The original rationale behind these special herbal tinctures {{seems to have been}} that an extract using alcohol could not be expected to contain all the medicinal properties from a living plant, and so the ash or mineral component (as a result of the calcination process) of the calcined plant was prepared separately and then added back to 'augment' (increase) the alcoholic tincture. The roots of the word therefore refer first to the extraction or separation process and then to the recombining process. These herbal tinctures are alleged to have superior medicinal properties to simple alcohol tinctures, perhaps due the formation of soap-like compounds from the essential oils and the basic salts contained within the ash. In theory these spagyrics can also optionally include material from fermentation of the plant material and also any aromatic component such as might be obtained through distillation. The final <b>spagyric</b> should be a re-blending of all such extracts into one 'essence.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Esoteric {{hermetic}} alchemists may reject work on exoteric substances, instead directing {{their search}} for the philosopher's stone inward.

5000|$|A unicorn horn, {{also known}} as an alicorn, is a legendary object whose reality may have been {{accepted}} in Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages. Many healing powers and antidote's virtues were attributed to the horn of the unicorn.

Beliefs related to the [...] "unicorn horn" [...] influenced alchemy through <b>spagyric</b> medicine. The horn's purification properties were eventually put to the test in, for example, the book of Ambroise Paré, Discourse on unicorn - marking the beginnings of the experimental method.|$|E
50|$|Conrad Khunrath {{was born}} around 1555 to the Leipzig {{merchant}} Sebastian Kunrat {{and his wife}} Anna. He had at least ten younger siblings, among them Heinrich Khunrath, who became known as an alchemist in his own right. By 1562, Conrad, still a child, had enrolled at Leipzig University, though this {{seems to have been}} only pro forma. In his youth, Conrad traveled around England where he learned the English language. He is known to have worked as a merchant from 1580; {{after the death of his}} father, Conrad also took over the cloth and vitriol trade.

5000|$|According to Mattei's {{own ideas}} however, every disease {{originates}} in {{the change of}} blood or of the lymphatic system or both, and remedies can therefore be mainly divided into two broad categories {{to be used in}} response to the dominant affected system. Mattei wrote that having obtained plant extracts, he was [...] "able to determine in the liquid vegetable electricity". Allied to his theories and therapies were elements of Chinese medicine, of medical humours, of apparent Brownianism, as well as modified versions of Samuel Hahnemann's homeopathic principles. Electrohomeopathy has some associations with <b>Spagyric</b> medicine, a holistic medical philosophy claimed to be the practical application of alchemy in medical treatment, so that the principle of modern electrohomeopathy is that disease is typically multi-organic in cause or effect and therefore requires holistic treatment that is at once both complex and natural.|$|E

40|$|Up to date {{there is}} a lack of {{systematically}} gathered data on the use of natural remedies (phytotherapeutic, homeopathic, anthroposophic, <b>spagyric,</b> Bach and Schussler remedies) during pregnancy and lactation. The aim of this non-representative pilot study on 139 women, who came for delivery to three institutions between mid- 1997 and the beginning of 1998, was to receive data about how often and within which spectrum natural remedies are used during pregnancy and lactation. During pregnancy 96 % and within the lactation period 84 % of the women consumed at least 1 natural remedy. Phytotherapeutic drugs were used most frequently. In contrast to the widespread use of natural remedies by pregnant women and nursing mothers in this study, little information on the effectiveness and possible risks is available.

40|$|The unicorn and the pharmacists. Early modern {{views on}} the presumed anti-toxic effects of unicorn horn. Around 1600, the age-old belief in the anti-toxic effect of unicorn horn began to be called into question. This is {{evidenced}} by the views of two well-known French pharmaceutic authorities whose publications are discussed in this paper: the surgeon Ambroise Paré (1510 - 1590), court physician to four French kings, and the Montpellier pharmacist Laurent Catelan (1568 - 1647), who owned a famous cabinet de curiosités. Although Paré had to accept, however reluctantly, the existence of the unicorn (since it is mentioned in the Bible), he vehemently denied the supposed medicinal effect of unicorn products. He defended his position by an appeal to ancient and contemporary authorities, by rational argumentation, and by experiment. Fare's arguments failed to convince Catelan, who adhered to an alternative, so-called <b>spagyric,</b> medical theory of neoplatonic inspiration, as propagated by Paracelsus and Ficino. Catelan remained convinced of the efficacity of unicorn horn, which in his view could drain the human body from any poisonous substance. The medical establishment being reluctant to give up a rewarding source of income, 'unicorn' remained much in demand as a prescription...|$|E
40|$|In medical historiography, Hendrik van Deventer {{is seen as}} {{the most}} {{important}} representative of early modern obstetrics in the Netherlands. This view is largely based on some mid-nineteenth-century biographical studies by the Frisian surgeon Kiestra, and publications on the history of obstetrics by the German obstetricians Nagele (1825) and Fasbender (1906). The many writings on the life and works of Van Deventer published in the Netherlands ever since prove for the greater part to be paraphrases of, or elaborations on, these older studies. This article offers substantial corrections to the prevailing view of the life and works of Van Deventer. It is based in part on recent new insights into past cultural and scientific contexts, including those of Labadism and the alchemical and chemical philosophy around 1700. It is based also on extensive archival research, which among other things led to the rediscovery of a thesis by Van Deventer long believed to have been lost. In addition, an until now unknown chemical treatise from Van Deventer's Wieuwerd years was unearthed, in addition to nine manuscripts, including his remarkable treatise on physics and chemistry ('First principles on true physics'). Providing a defence of a craft based on anatomical knowledge. Van Deventer offered both male and female midwives a 'new light' by which to guide their obstetric activity. However, Van Deventer also proves to have been a disguised Labadist who held outspoken ideas on marriage, the family, and education, as well as on creation, recreation, and the apocalypse (chiliasm). Van Deventer is presented here not only as a surgeon, orthopaedist and obstetrician who was capable of improving his personal expertise, but also as a chemical physician who developed a flourishing trade in <b>spagyric</b> remedies, and as a chemist belonging to a fascinating group of Dutch researchers inspired by the English Paracelsist George Starkey. In his treatise on physics and chemistry. Van Deventer reveals himself to have been a Christian philosopher, intent on devising a strictly biblical cosmogony on the basis of revised physical science, and employing to this end a theory of five elements and an amended pneumatic theory. Van Deventer attempted to consolidate his views on chemistry through extensive experimentation and research...|$|E
