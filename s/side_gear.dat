50|$|In {{front wheel}} drive vehicles, the drive shafts {{transfer}} the drive directly from the differential to the front wheels. A short inner stub shaft is splined to the differential <b>side</b> <b>gear</b> and an outer stub shaft is splined to the front wheel hub. Each stub shaft has a yoke, or housing, to accommodate a universal joint, {{at each end of}} a connecting intermediate shaft.|$|E
50|$|NVT {{continued}} {{with a program}} of works closures, deciding to concentrate production on Wolverhampton and Small Heath. Poorly handled in communications, the announcement caused a sit-in at Meriden which, as it produced parts for other factories, caused Small Heath to shut down. With {{the election of the}} 1974 Labour government, the Meriden workers' co-operative was formed with NVT its sole customer for its production of 750 cc Triumph Bonneville T140V and Triumph Tiger TR7V models. Forced by American legislation to move all brake controls to the right-hand side of the bike, the standard used by most other manufacturers, including the Japanese. The foot-brake lever on British motorcycles was positioned on the left-hand side as it was to this side that sidecars were affixed. The brake pedal on the sidecar was then positioned alongside the brake pedal of the motorcycle allowing braking of both motorcycle and sidecar with one foot. The company reduced its range to five models: two Norton Commandos (the Mk.3 Interstate and the Roadster), the Triumph Bonneville T140V, the Triumph Tiger TR7RV and the Triumph Trident T160V. Both Nortons and the T160 were improved by the fitting of an electric starter, a rear disc brake and the left <b>side</b> <b>gear</b> change/right foot brake. The Bonneville got its own electric start in 1980 when marketed by the Meriden workers' co-operative itself. Unlike other motorcycles of this era, the kickstart lever was retained and the electric starter on Nortons was more properly referred to as an electric assister.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bending fatigue {{is one of}} {{the main}} failure modes of gears. The method of gear fatigue design was {{discussed}} in many papers. Most of them are based on GB/T 3480 - 83. But study shows that the method current widely used only fits for the single <b>side</b> loaded <b>gear.</b> For double <b>sides</b> loaded <b>gear,</b> only a mean stress modification coefficient is concerned compared to single <b>side</b> loaded <b>gear.</b> A new formula based on fatigue theory is given to modify the mean stress in consideration of the load character of doubled <b>sides</b> loaded <b>gear.</b> The method given in the paper is an addition to the traditional gear design method...|$|R

40|$|The report {{thoroughly}} {{discusses the}} theory of dynamics of planar mathematical-physical models of planetary differential and special cases of pseudoplanetary transmission systems. Due {{to the existence of}} the tooth backlashes, the system is seen as a discrete nonconservative strongly nonlinear parametric and multifrequency excited system with many degrees of freedom. The equations of motion are derived and compiled {{on the basis of the}} Lagrangian theory in a compact form and express the three areas of the gear mesh, ie. the range of normal gear mesh, gear backlash area and the area of the inverse gear mesh. After the rebound meshing gear profiles in the region of the <b>side</b> <b>gear</b> backlash, the impact effects occur when re contacting tooth flanks in both normal as well as during the eventual inverse mesh, depending on the size of the dynamic forces in the gearing...|$|E

50|$|Although {{a widely}} used system, {{this system is}} not as {{efficient}} as a system with locking hubs. A CAD system spins the axle shafts, spider <b>gears,</b> and <b>side</b> <b>gears</b> in the carrier during normal driving. Locking hubs disengage the axle at the wheels, allowing all of the axle to be at rest during normal driving. Not as efficient as locking hubs, a CAD system still makes for much less drag than having the axle completely locked in.|$|R
50|$|On either <b>side</b> of the <b>gear</b> are {{the thrust}} washers. The thrust washers are pushed against the ball {{bearings}} inside the gear by Belleville washers. On one <b>side</b> of the <b>gear</b> is an adjusting collar, {{which allows for}} adjustments {{in the amount of}} slip allowed by the differential. A thrust bearing (or thrust race), on the opposite <b>side</b> of the <b>gear,</b> is used to stop the differential from loosening the retaining screw holding the output cups, used to attach the differential to the axle, onto the differential.|$|R

25|$|Barrientos' {{dilemma of}} {{allegiance}} was resolved when Álvaro de Luna returned from abroad, bringing {{with him the}} support of the Diocese of Toledo, which had practically unlimited resources, and which had granted him their patronage at the behest of his half brother, Juan de Cerezuela. Greatly aided by their financial backing and political cachet, he was able to mobilize royalist supporters of the crown to fight for the king. While the two <b>sides</b> <b>geared</b> up for war (ultimately taking place in Olmedo), Barrientos, his course now clear, traveled to the town of Madrigal de las Altas Torres (northern Ávila) to convince the heir, Prince Henry, to forbear from taking up arms against his own father.|$|R
50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an axle shaft (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and <b>side</b> <b>gears</b> to spin, while the differential carrier, pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split axle shafts. The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|R

Sterland became an immediate favourite with the Elland Road fans as his five goals in 42 league games that season sealed Leeds the Second Division title and promotion back to the First Division after eight years away. He helped Leeds make an immediate impact on their return to the top flight as they finished fourth - though this was slightly soured {{by the fact that}} although the ban on English clubs in Europe had now been lifted, Leeds were unable to compete in the UEFA Cup as English clubs were only being gradually phased back into the competition with just runners-up Liverpool being admitted for the 1991-92 competition.|$|R

2500|$|A {{landmark}} party {{meeting was}} held in December 1963, shortly after a military coup in Saigon in which Diệm was assassinated. North Vietnamese leaders debated the issue of [...] "quick victory" [...] vs [...] "protracted war" [...] (guerrilla warfare). After this meeting, the communist <b>side</b> <b>geared</b> up for a maximum military effort and PAVN troop strength increased from 174,000 {{at the end of}} 1963 to 300,000 in 1964. The Soviets cut aid in 1964 as an expression of annoyance with Hanoi's ties to China. Even as Hanoi embraced China's international line, it continued to follow the Soviet model of reliance on technical specialists and bureaucratic management, as opposed to mass mobilization. The winter of 1964–1965 was a high-water mark for the Việt Cộng, with the Saigon government on the verge of collapse. Soviet aid soared following a visit to Hanoi by Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin in February 1965. Hanoi was soon receiving up-to-date surface-to-air missiles. The U.S. would have 200,000 soldiers in South Vietnam {{by the end of the}} year.|$|R
2500|$|The {{preferred}} form of LSD for drifting is {{the clutch}} type, in [...] "two-way" [...] form, for its consistent and aggressive lockup behavior under all conditions (acceleration and deceleration). Some drift cars use a spool [...] "differential", which actually has no differential action at all - the wheels are locked to each other. Budget-minded drifters may use a welded differential, where the <b>side</b> <b>gears</b> are welded {{to give the}} same effect as a spool. This {{makes it easier to}} break rear traction because it reduces maximum traction in all situations except traveling in a straight line. Welded differentials have an inherent risk involved: due to the tremendous amount of internal stress the welds may fail and the differential completely lock up leaving the rear wheels immobilized. Helical torque-sensing differentials such as the Torsen or Quaife (available on cars in certain stock trims such as S15, FD3S, MX-5, JZA80, UZZ3x) are also adequate. It is common for drifters to change the final gear ratio {{depending on the type of}} track layout.|$|R

50|$|A {{gear motor}} (external gear) {{consists}} of two gears, the driven gear (attached to the output shaft {{by way of a}} key, etc.) and the idler gear. High pressure oil is ported into one <b>side</b> of the <b>gears,</b> where it flows around the periphery of the gears, between the gear tips and the wall housings in which it resides, to the outlet port. The gears then mesh, not allowing the oil from the outlet side to flow back to the inlet side. For lubrication, the gear motor uses a small amount of oil from the pressurized <b>side</b> of the <b>gears,</b> bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure <b>side</b> of the <b>gears,</b> or through a dedicated drain port on the motor housing. An especially positive attribute of the gear motor is that catastrophic breakdown is less common than in most other types of hydraulic motors. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the motor gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|R
