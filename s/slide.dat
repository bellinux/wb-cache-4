The main {{goal is to}} guarantee acceptable trajectories tracking between {{the internal combustion engine}} (IC engine) air to fuel ratio and the desired input. The fuzzy controller in proposed fuzzy <b>sliding</b> mode controller is based on Mamdani’s fuzzy inference system (FIS) and it has one input and one output. The input represents the function between <b>sliding</b> function, error and the rate of error. The outputs represent fuel ratio, respectively. The <b>sliding</b> mode fuzzy methodology is on-line tune the <b>sliding</b> function based on self tuning methodology. The performance of the <b>sliding</b> mode fuzzy on-line tune fuzzy <b>sliding</b> mode controller (SFOFSMC) is validated through comparison with previously developed IC engine controller based on <b>sliding</b> mode control theory (SMC). Simulation results signify good performance of fuel ratio in presence of uncertainty and external disturbance.

40|$|A {{test system}} was {{developed}} to understand the <b>sliding</b> mechanism of coal-rock structure. The test system was composed by a double-shear testing model and an acousto-optic monitoring system in association with a digital camera and an acoustic emission (AE) instrument. The tests can simulate the movement of activated faults and the <b>sliding</b> in coal-rock structure. In this regard, instable <b>sliding</b> conditions of coal-rock samples, <b>sliding</b> types under different conditions, displacement evolution law, and AE characteristics during <b>sliding</b> process were investigated. Several <b>sliding</b> types were monitored in the tests, including unstable continuous <b>sliding,</b> unstable discontinuous <b>sliding,</b> and stable <b>sliding.</b> The <b>sliding</b> types have close relation with the axial loads and loading rates. Larger axial load and smaller loading rate mean that unstable <b>sliding</b> {{is less likely to}} occur. The peak shear stress was positively correlated with the axial load when <b>sliding</b> occurred, whereas the displacement induced by unstable <b>sliding</b> was uncorrelated with the axial load. A large number of AE events occurred before <b>sliding,</b> and the AE rate decreased after stable <b>sliding.</b> The results show that the tests can well simulate the process of structural instability in a coal bump, and are helpful in the understanding of fault activation and the physical processes during squeezing process of roof and floor...|$|R

It has been claimed that the discontinuous control action results in superb system performance which includes insensitivity to parameter variations and complete rejection of disturbances. Due to this virtue, <b>sliding</b> mode control has been widely applied and research on <b>sliding</b> mode control theory is greatly motivated as challenges and demands grow.
