25|$|Along {{with much}} of the central and {{northern}} California coast, Big Sur frequently has dense fog in summer. The summer fog and summer drought have the same underlying cause: a massive, stable seasonal high pressure system that forms over the north Pacific Ocean. The high pressure cell inhibits rainfall and generates northwesterly air flow. These prevailing summer winds from the northwest drive the ocean surface water slightly offshore (through the Ekman effect) which generates an upwelling of colder <b>sub</b> <b>surface</b> water. The water vapor in the air contacting this cold water condenses into fog. The fog usually moves out to sea during the day and closes in at night, but sometimes heavy fog blankets the coast all day. Fog is an essential summer water source for many Big Sur coastal plants. While few plants can take water directly out of the air, water condensation on leaf surfaces slowly precipitates into the ground like rain.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the abrasive wear behavior of two chromium based hardfacing alloys with {{different combinations of}} chromium and carbon on a mild steel substrate. Effects of welding parameters and material on the wear behavior of the specimens were studied. Operating material removal mechanisms also were analyzed through the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of typical wear <b>surfaces,</b> <b>sub</b> <b>surfaces</b> regions and debris particles. The results suggest a significant improvement in the wear resistance of the hardfacing layers over that of the substrate. Further, the specimens overlaid with the material with low carbon and high chromium contents attained better wear resistance than the one consisting of more carbon but less chromium. The former specimen also attained superior hardness. Smoother abrasion grooves on the wear surfaces and finer debris formation during the abrasion of the hardfacing samples were consistent with wear resistance superior {{to that of the}} substrate...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{analytical}} <b>sub</b> threshold <b>surface</b> potential model of novel structures called Double pocket Dual Material Gate and Single pocket Dual Material Gate MOSFETs are presented which combines {{the advantages of}} both the channel engineering and the gate engineering techniques to effectively suppress the short channel effects. The models are derived using the pseudo 2 D analysis by applying the Gauss’s law to a rectangular box considering the surface potential variation with the channel depletion layer depth. The overlap and the inner fringing field capacitances at the two ends of the MOSFET are considered in our models for accurate estimation of the <b>sub</b> threshold <b>surface</b> potential. The adequacy of the model is verified by comparing with 2 D device simulator DESSIS. A very good agreement of our model with DESSIS is obtained proving the validity of our model for suppressing the short channel effects...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBauxite {{deposits}} are studied {{because of}} their economic value and because they {{play an important role}} in the study of paleoclimate and paleogeography of continents. They provide a rare record of the weathering and evolution of continental surfaces. Geomicrobiological analysis makes it possible to verify that microorganisms have played a critical role during the formation of bauxite with the possibility already intimated in previous studies. Ambient temperature, abundance of water, organic carbon and bioavailable iron and other metal substrates provide a suitable environment for microbes to inhabit. Thiobacillus, Leptospirilum, Thermophilic bacteria and Heterotrophs have been shown to be able to oxidize ferrous iron and to reduce sulfate-generating sulfuric acid, which can accelerate the weathering of aluminosilicates and precipitation of iron oxyhydroxides. Microorganisms referred to the genus Bacillus can mediate the release of alkaline metals. Although the dissimilatory iron-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria in bauxites have not yet been identified, some recorded authigenic carbonates and “bacteriopyrites” that appear to be unique in morphology and grain size might record microbial activity. Typical bauxite minerals such as gibbsite, kaolinite, covellite, galena, pyrite, zircon, calcium plagioclase, orthoclase, and albite have been investigated as part of an analysis of microbial mediation. The paleoecology of such bauxitic microorganisms inhabiting continental (<b>sub)</b> <b>surfaces,</b> revealed through geomicrobiological analysis, will add a further dimension to paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental studies...|$|R
