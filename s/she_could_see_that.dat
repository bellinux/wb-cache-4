2500|$|In 1959, while {{photographing the}} making of The Unforgiven, {{starring}} Audrey Hepburn, Burt Lancaster, and Audie Murphy, Morath accompanied Huston and his friends duck hunting on a mountain lake outside Durango, Mexico. Photographing the excursion, Morath saw through her telephoto lens that Murphy and his companion had capsized their boat 350 feet from shore. [...] <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Murphy, stunned, was nearly drowning. A skilled swimmer, Morath stripped to her underwear and hauled the two men ashore by her bra strap while the hunt continued uninterrupted.|$|E
60|$|Drunken he was not, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> {{and from}} his {{babbling}} {{she knew he was}} partly delirious.|$|E
6000|$|... “What’s the matter?” asked Mrs Verloc in a subdued voice. Through {{the door}} left ajar <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the {{customer}} was not gone yet.|$|E
60|$|He nodded, {{and though}} she had scored her point <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it had any {{material}} bearing after all.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her on this with {{conscious}} inconsistency, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> now <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he had changed colour. But he was always easy.|$|R
6000|$|And I, still lying, {{showed her}} the pretended fatal words on the pretended fatal page, and she gazed at them through her tears, and said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> herself <b>that</b> they were hateful, ugly words--they [...] "had the very look of it." ...|$|R
60|$|She leant back in {{her chair}} and looked laughingly at the young man. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he was {{genuinely}} cross, if at the same time slightly excited.|$|E
60|$|For {{this reason}} she conserved her {{energies}} {{and her voice}} until <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they had approached near enough to the camp to attract the succor she craved.|$|E
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> if {{she could}} not keep these tidy little trained {{children}} in order, {{she would not have}} much chance with the street Arabs she had read of.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the very}} heart of the herd the din was terrific. It was almost dizzying in its effect. I paused and smiled {{reassuringly}} at Maud, for I had recovered my equanimity sooner than <b>she.</b> I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was still badly frightened. She came close to me and shouted: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{just about}} the right size," [...] said the Mayor, looking them over with much pleasure, and when the girl turned around she found Mr. Bowko and Mrs. Puff-Pudgy {{standing}} beside her, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Chubbins was no bigger than they, and she was no bigger than Chubbins.|$|R
6000|$|Taurus Antinor's {{eyes were}} fixed into vacancy, and she trembled because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>that</b> which he saw. Was he looking on that very vision which he had conjured up, a cross, broken and tempest-tossed, a symbol of that power which to him was mightier than the Empire of Rome, mightier than the kingdom of her love? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he was seething with {{feelings}} {{he wanted to}} express; {{but she did not}} mean to help him. She hated herself at this moment, and almost hated him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very true," [...] {{observed}} Miss Pritty, with a good-natured smile, {{for even}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the Irishman was {{poking fun at}} her; [...] "but how is air conveyed to him?" ...|$|E
60|$|Through {{the open}} door between her room and Frances's <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the latter's bed was empty. Then she saw a little note, {{addressed}} to her, pinned on the pillow.|$|E
60|$|Lucilla had no reply. She had not learnt {{the joy of}} the week's Easter-day. It had an {{habitual}} awe for her, not sacred delight; and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{because it}} was one point where religion taught the world that it had laws of its own, besides those of mere experience and morality, therefore the world complained, and would fain shake off the thraldom.|$|R
6000|$|... "So it seems. And yet you're {{just the}} kind of figure to catch a girl's eye. <b>She</b> likes you--I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> but you've got a good opinion of yourself. You're an educated man--do you intend to marry her?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{wheels of}} the post-chaise rolled away {{as she entered the}} dining-room, where the supper was spread; and {{presently}} he rejoined her there. He had removed his cloak and hat, but the mask was still retained; and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> now <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it was of special make, of some flexible material like silk, coloured so as to represent flesh; it joined naturally to the front hair, and was otherwise cleverly executed.|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped and}} chafed his red hands abstractedly together. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he had evidently just washed them--and the glaring ring was more in {{evidence}} than ever. But the thought {{gave her an}} inspiration.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he {{had already}} {{gathered}} spirit for new endeavor with the play, and her heart yearned upon him in pride and fondness. [...] "Oh, you dear! What {{do you intend to}} do next?" ...|$|E
60|$|She was {{suffering}} keenly now, not {{on her own}} account, but on his, for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he was very tired, and to climb up that hill again was like punishing him a second time.|$|E
60|$|Set {{down by the}} omnibus at {{the corner}} of Saint Mary Axe, and trusting to her feet and her crutch-stick within its precincts, the dolls' {{dressmaker}} proceeded to the place of business of Pubsey and Co. All there was sunny and quiet externally, and shady and quiet internally. Hiding herself in the entry outside the glass door, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from <b>that</b> post of observation the old man in his spectacles sitting writing at his desk.|$|R
5000|$|Cleo {{is still}} in love with Angus. But he only pretends to be {{interested}} with her. He shows his parents that he's normal by [...] "going out" [...] with Cleo. The girl sings with his and Kyle's band on the music festival. But they don't win the prize. Cleo breaks up with Angus, because she is upset of being not exactly his girlfriend. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> also <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> Angus is more interested in Kyle.|$|R
6000|$|Here Issachar broke off, {{suddenly}} recognising {{the lady}} Elissa among the white-robed priestesses. Watching her, he noted her {{glance at the}} window of Aziel's chamber, and saw what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see,</b> <b>that</b> the prince was seated there. [...] "This daughter of Satan spreads her nets," [...] he muttered between his teeth. Then a thought struck him, and he added aloud, [...] "Say, Metem, is it permitted to strangers to witness the rites in yonder temple?" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was no more}} to be said, and the {{man came}} out, encountering Elizabeth-Jane in his passage. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> his mouth twitched with anger, and that bitter {{disappointment}} was written in his face everywhere.|$|E
6000|$|Maisie considered. [...] "She wouldn't have me even now." [...] <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{he had his}} idea, {{but that}} her tone {{impressed}} him. That disappointed her a little, though in an instant he rang out again.|$|E
60|$|Her {{friends were}} looking with round {{thoughtful}} eyes {{at her and}} him, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they had been talking of her. He hastily bade them farewell, and splashed back along the stretch of submerged road.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Miss Thorne; {{where is}} Miss Thorne?" [...] {{she said as}} soon as her attendants had placed her in her {{position}} just before one of the windows, from whence <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> all <b>that</b> was going on upon the lawn. [...] "How am I {{to thank you for}} permitting a creature like me to be here? But if you knew the pleasure you give me, I am sure you would excuse the trouble I bring with me." [...] And as she spoke she squeezed the spinster's little hand between her own.|$|R
60|$|Thus it {{was that}} when, in {{the evening of the}} same day, Mrs. Manston reached Carriford Road Station, her husband was still at Chettlewood, ignorant of her arrival, and on looking up and down the platform, dreary with autumn gloom and wind, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> no sign <b>that</b> any {{preparation}} whatever had been made for her reception and conduct home.|$|R
50|$|She also complained <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>that</b> one {{volunteer}} had {{had their}} appendix removed {{because she said}} appendixes sometimes grow back. She said she {{was not able to}} compare her own diagnosis to an independent medical diagnosis after key experiments had been conducted, preventing her from being able to see if she was diagnosing genuine conditions that were unknown to those conducting the experiments, and which were thus being listed against her in the overall results despite them being valid (due to this complaint, all volunteers in subsequent experiments, in Tokyo, were required to bring medical certificates with them before diagnosis).|$|R
60|$|Minnie's heart sank, for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{the thing}} was a small brooch which {{she was in the}} habit of wearing in her neckerchief, and which must have been {{detached}} when Ruby carried her into the cave.|$|E
60|$|He {{asked her}} {{questions}} about herself. But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he was tired; so {{she told him}} it was too important a matter to start upon so late. She would talk about herself to-morrow. It would be Sunday.|$|E
60|$|She {{could say}} nothing. To her, also, {{it seemed that}} this {{was as far as}} one could go. She waited through a long stillness. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Denton sat with his arms about his knees, his chin almost {{touching}} them.|$|E
6000|$|Ida had wavered but an instant; her {{companion}} clearly gave her moral support. Maisie thought he somehow looked brave, {{and he had}} no likeness whatever to Mr. Perriam. His face, thin and rather sharp, was smooth, and it was not till they came nearer that she saw he had a remarkably fair little moustache. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> already <b>see</b> <b>that</b> his eyes were of the lightest blue. He was far nicer than Mr. Perriam. Mamma looked terrible from afar, but even under her guns the child's curiosity flickered and she appealed again to Sir Claude. [...] "Is it--IS it Lord Eric?" ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time Maggie's heart began to beat in an agony of dread. She sat helpless, dimly {{conscious}} {{that she was being}} floated along, more intensely conscious of the anticipated clash. But the horror was transient; it passed away before the oncoming warehouses of St. Ogg's. She had passed the mouth of the Ripple, then; now, she must use all her skill and power to manage the boat and get it if possible out of the current. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> now <b>that</b> the bridge was broken down; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the masts of a stranded vessel far out over the watery field. But no boats were to be seen moving on the river,--such as had been laid hands on were employed in the flooded streets.|$|R
60|$|As {{she leaned}} forward over her horse's shoulder, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by the dim light {{that he was a}} miner, and that, though motionless, he was {{breathing}} stertorously. Drunk, no doubt!--an accident of the locality alarming only to her horse. But although she cantered impatiently forward, she had not proceeded a hundred yards before she stopped reflectively, and trotted back again. He had not moved. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> now <b>see</b> <b>that</b> his head and shoulders were covered with broken clods of earth and gravel, and smaller fragments lay at his side. A dozen feet above him on the hillside there was a foot trail which ran parallel with the bridle-road, and occasionally overhung it. It seemed possible that he might have fallen from the trail and been stunned.|$|R
