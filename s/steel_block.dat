2500|$|In {{order to}} {{withstand}} the high g-forces experienced during pullup after a dive attack, much of the aircraft's center-section was cut from a solid <b>steel</b> <b>block.</b> It was powered by a similar Pratt & Whitney R-1535 Twin Wasp Junior air-cooled radial engine as used by the Great Lakes design, and had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The crew of two sat in tandem in separate cockpits, with the observer in the rear cockpit armed with a single flexibly mounted machine gun, and the pilot with a single fixed [...] synchronized machine gun firing through the aircraft's propeller arc. Its bombload was carried on a crutch under the fuselage that swung down to ensure the bomb would clear the propeller when dropped in a steep dive.|$|E
2500|$|A mitrailleuse ( [...] ; from French mitraille, [...] "grapeshot") {{is a type}} of {{volley gun}} with {{multiple}} barrels of rifle calibre that can fire either multiple rounds at once or several rounds in rapid succession. The earliest true mitrailleuse was invented in 1851 by Belgian Army Captain Fafschamps, 10 years before the advent of the Gatling gun. It was followed by the Belgian Montigny mitrailleuse in 1863. Then the French 25 barrel [...] "Canon à Balles", better known as the Reffye mitrailleuse, was adopted in great secrecy in 1866. It became the first rapid-firing weapon deployed as standard equipment by any army in a major conflict when it was used during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. A <b>steel</b> <b>block</b> containing twenty-five 13mm (.51 calibre) centre-fire cartridges was locked against the breech before firing. With the rotation of a crank, the 25 rounds were discharged in rapid succession. The sustainable firing rate of the Reffye mitrailleuse was 100 rounds per minute. The maximum effective range of the Reffye mitrailleuse was about 2000 yards; a distance which placed their batteries beyond the reach of Prussian Dreyse needle rifle fire. Reffye mitrailleuses were deployed in six gun batteries and were manned by artillery personnel. They were not infantry support weapons but rather a form of special artillery.|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} {{expected}} that {{in the beginning of}} July enough water would be passing down the Second Cataract to enable the gunboats and steamers waiting below to make the passage. Everything depended upon the rise of the river, and in the perversity of circumstances the river this year rose much later and slower than usual. By the middle of August, however, the attempt appeared possible. On the 14th the first gunboat, the Metemma, approached the Cataract. The North Staffordshire Regiment from Gemai, and the 6th and 7th Egyptian Battalions from Kosheh, marched to the 'Gate' to draw the vessel bodily up in spite of the current. The best native pilots had been procured. Colonel Hunter and the naval officers under Commander Colville directed the work. The boat had been carefully prepared for the ordeal. To reduce, by raising the free-board, the risk of swamping, the bows were heightened and strengthened, and stout wooden bulwarks were built running from bow to stern. Guns and ammunition were then removed, and the vessel lightened by every possible means. A strop of wire rope was passed completely round the hull, and to this strong belt the five cables were fastened--two on each side and one at the bow. So steep was the slope of the water that it was found necessary to draw all the fires, and the steamer was thus dependent entirely upon external force. It was luckily possible to obtain a direct pull, for a crag of black rock rose above the surface of the pool opposite the 'Gate.' On this a <b>steel</b> <b>block</b> was fixed, and the hawser was led away at right angles until it reached the east bank, where a smooth stretch of sand afforded a convenient place for the hauling parties. Two thousand men were then set to pull at the cables, yet such was the extraordinary force of the current that, although the actual distance in which these great efforts were necessary was scarcely one hundred yards, the passage of each steamer occupied an hour and a half, and required the most strenuous exertions of the soldiers. No accident, however, occurred, and the six other vessels accomplished the ascent on successive days. In a week the whole flotilla steamed safely in the open water of the upper reach.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As for jacket {{dragging}} load-out foundations, {{the concrete}} skidway blocks were prone to be sheared and wrecked, especially the outer blocks, for they generally swung with the tugboat. This paper takes dragging load-out of LS 36 - 1 jacket on 3 # skidway for example, and proposes a design analysis for dock apron skidway blocks. The design philosophy is replacing original concrete <b>blocks</b> with <b>steel</b> <b>blocks,</b> {{and the new}} <b>steel</b> <b>blocks</b> not only have good shear strength and compressive strength, {{but they are also}} easier to connect and fix with skidway. In addition, some essential strengthen measures are adopted, reformed 3 # skidway blocks are ready for much heavier modules and jackets dragging load-out works...|$|R

50|$|The {{plant was}} {{established}} in 1736, when Empress Anna ordered {{the establishment of a}} smelter to produce steel for the nearby factories that existed at the time, supplying <b>steel</b> <b>blocks</b> for the manufacture of rifles and guns.

40|$|The {{supply of}} <b>steel</b> <b>blocks</b> with {{customised}} dimensions for clients within the metalworking industry requires the effective management {{of a large}} and highly variable stock of <b>steel</b> <b>blocks.</b> This paper proposes a cutting decision process for daily tailored orders of a real-life steel retailer. The problem is approached as a three-dimensional (3 D) cutting and packing (C%P) problem with variable sized blocks and daily changing characteristics, which results in high computational complexity. A novel definition is proposed {{for this type of}} problem. Large time periods are considered, as one day cutting configuration has impact on the following days. The proposed approach considers the usable leftovers of the preceding days to the input stock of the next day. A first-fit decreasing (FFD) and best-fit decreasing (BFD) approaches are proposed to deal with the problem, in order to minimise the stock growth. The results show that the proposed algorithms are able to keep the stock size low and to generate a small number of stock pieces with low weight.

50|$|A grind gage is {{typically}} a flat <b>steel</b> <b>block</b> which has two grooves {{in it with}} flat bottoms {{at each end of}} the gage, one end at a maximum and the other at a minimum. In between these extremes is a gradually increasing groove depth, this groove depth is determined by either one or many scales which are used to measure and determine particle size.|$|E
50|$|Gauge blocks {{are usually}} made either from {{hardened}} alloy tool steels or from cemented carbides (such as tungsten carbide or tantalum carbide). Often the carbide has a hardness of 1500 Vickers hardness. Long series blocks {{are made from}} high-quality steel having cross section (35 × 9 mm) with holes for clamping two slips together. These are also available in carbon <b>steel</b> material. <b>Steel</b> <b>blocks</b> are hardened and tempered. The hardness {{is important because it}} slows down the gauge's rate of wear during use (this is why other kinds of gauges, such as pins, thread plugs, and rings, are also hardened.) The cutting of the blocks to size is accomplished with grinding followed by lapping. Usually no plating or other coating is involved. Blocks are kept very lightly oiled, and are stored and used in dry climate-controlled conditions; unplated, uncoated <b>steel</b> gauge <b>blocks</b> can last for decades without rusting.|$|R

40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is {{a general}} purpose detector, {{designed}} to run at the highest luminosity at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Its distinctive features include a 4 T superconducting solenoid with 6 -m-diameter by 12. 5 -m-length free bore, enclosed inside a 10, 000 -ton return yoke made of construction steel. The flux return yoke consists of five dodecagonal three-layered barrel wheels and four end-cap disks at each end comprised of <b>steel</b> <b>blocks</b> up to 620 mm thick, which serve as the absorber plates of the muon detection system.
