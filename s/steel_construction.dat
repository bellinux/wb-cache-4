5|$|Contracts {{to build}} the Fort Henry Bridge were let to the American Bridge Company, a {{subsidiary}} of U.S. Steel, and Dravo Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Costing $6.8million, $1.8million over budget, and taking four years to complete, the Fort Henry Bridge opened to traffic on September 8, 1955 after a ribbon-cutting ceremony with then-governor William C. Marland {{in front of a}} crowd of 55,000 to 60,000 people. The bridge earned an Honorable Mention in 1955 from the National Steel Bridge Alliance, a part of the American Institute of <b>Steel</b> <b>Construction,</b> which recognizes the best steel bridges of the year. At the time of construction, the bridge was only the second tied-arch bridge across the Ohio River.|$|E
5|$|The French navy {{built the}} first ironclad to try to gain a {{strategic}} advantage over the British, but were consistently out-built by the British. Despite taking the lead {{with a number of}} innovations like breech-loading weapons and <b>steel</b> <b>construction,</b> the French navy could never match the size of the Royal Navy. In the 1870s, the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in France as the Jeune Ecole school of naval thought took prominence, suggesting that torpedo boats and unarmored cruisers would be the future of warships. Like the British, the French navy saw little action with its ironclads; the French blockade of Germany in the Franco-Prussian War was ineffective, as the war was settled entirely on land.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{predicted}} durability term of <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> coatings using accelerated tests and experimental determination of <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> coatings fire-resistance after weather testings is {{raised in the}} article. The benefits and drawbacks of <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> in present-day building industry and construction design are introduced. The factors influencing <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> fire resistance increase are presented. The article shows that the most advanced and ideal {{for the protection of}} <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> is using the agents that expand and blow up under the temperature influence, forming thus a porous structure on the surface to be protected. The stages to receive the necessary indexes of predicted durability term of <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> coatings as well as methods to carry out climate tests both in the heated and unheated premises are described. For experimental determination of <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> coatings fire resistance it is suggested to use the method based on the experimental determination of the temperature of a steel plate with fire-resistant coating in the conditions of high temperatures typical of a fire, and on the solution of inverse and direct tasks of heat conduction for determination of thermal and physical characteristics of fire-resistant coatings and dependence of minimum coating thickness on the thickness of the steel plate, durability of fire impact and the steel critical temperature value. It is concluded that there is the necessity to develop the methodological support that makes it possible to estimate the coatings fire-resistance after or in the process of carrying out the accelerated climate tests as compared to the control examples. The list of problems that come into being while determining the <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> coatings fire-resistance after the climate tests is distinguished as well as the purpose of the future researches and tasks that should be solve...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{assessment}} of the total service life of <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> shall gain importance {{in the near future}} due to the increasing significance of building preservation and building modernization. The main cause for failure of existing structural <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> under cyclic loading effects is material fatigue. Most <b>steel</b> <b>constructions</b> are however failure tolerant. For economic reasons, this behavior can be considered by including the crack propagation phase into the assessment. In this contribution newly developed software tools and the results of some executed simulations of the total lifetime on existing structures will be presented...|$|R
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on <b>steel</b> <b>construction</b> sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E
