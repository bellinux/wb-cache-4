5000|$|Neo has carried, {{since his}} conception, the Matrix's source code {{known as the}} Prime Program. This gives him the ability to freely {{manipulate}} the simulated reality of the Matrix, similar to the authority a system administrator has over a given system. He manifests these abilities as various superhuman powers. The power Neo exhibits most often is akin to telekinesis in the Matrix. In that, he seems capable of manipulating any object in the Matrix through will alone. By focusing this ability upon himself, he can fly at amazing speeds and jump great distances. Whilst his speed is never specified, he flies from the Merovingian's mountain manor to the highway [...] "500 miles due south" [...] {{in a very short}} time. His speed of flight is further exemplified by his ability to escape explosions, and the sonic boom left in his wake has the power to overturn rows of heavy vehicles. He has used this ability multiple times to stop several bullets in mid flight, first against the Agents and again against the Merovingian. In addition to his abilities, Neo possesses superhuman strength and agility, and is near-invulnerable to most attacks. Although, despite this, whilst he could block a sword with the edge of his hand, he still received a small cut where he made contact with the sword, indicating (as the Merovingian pointed out) that he was still human despite his powers. His endurance is also finite: when confronted by masses of Smith clones in the second film, Neo was forced to escape rather than continue fighting through he easily overpowered at least 40 Smith clones and threw about 50 of him, and upon being disconnected from the Matrix, he appeared exhausted and winded. His reflexes are great enough to dodge bullets. Neo's strength and <b>speed</b> <b>level</b> have never been accurately measured, the level of speed he showed in the 2nd movie he could move at Mach 8 regularly and Mach 10 under stress also he could generate enough force to destroy buildings and take similar impacts but he is vulnerable to heat and sharpness. By the third movie his full strength is shown when Neo fights Smith and his punches are faster than lightning, and he generated enough force to make an entire barrier of water form around him that was as big as several city blocks Neo could also withstand that punch and his own.|$|E

40|$|Floating bush journal {{bearings}} {{are widely used}} to support small-sized high-speed rotating machinery. When　the supplied pressure is low, the bearing shows peculiar phenomena. As the shaft rotational speed increases, the bush rotational <b>speed</b> <b>levels</b> off and {{the disappearance of the}} oil whip is observed. They can be explained qualitatively by applying the hydrodynamic lubrication model with the axial oil film rupture being considered. However, the predictions are in quantitatively poor agreement with the measurements. This experimental report shows the effect of the circumferential oil groove and holes into the inner oil film and the slope of the bush inner side end, which are not considered in the theoretical model, on the bush rotational speed and the high-speed stability. It is found that the bush rotational <b>speed</b> <b>levels</b> off at a lower shaft rotational speed, resulting in the lower bush speed, and that the oil whip disappears at a lower shaft speed, when the supplied pressure is lower.
