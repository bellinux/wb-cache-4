500|$|The first {{performance}} of [...] "Candy Shop" [...] {{was on the}} Hard Candy Promo Tour of 2008; Madonna, wearing a skintight black suit and a lace top, appeared on the stage while sitting on a throne [...] with a golden walking stick, as {{the music of the}} song started. Images of confectionery flashed on the television screens flanking the back of the stage as Madonna and [...] her six dancers gyrated in choreographed dance moves. That same year, the song was performed as the opening number of the Sticky & Sweet Tour. Similar to the promo tour, Madonna appeared on a M-shaped throne dressed in a Givenchy-designed dress, <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> legs spread apart and holding a staff in her hands and was accompanied by dancers in bondage themed costumes, while the backdrop screens depicted images of gumdrops and candies. For the 2009 extension of the tour, the backdrop video for [...] "Candy Shop" [...] was replaced by a new one by artist Marilyn Minter, featuring imagery of a giant tongue licking and spitting out neon-colored icing. Madonna also wore new opening outfit designed by Riccardo Tisci. The live {{performance of}} the song at River Plate Stadium of Buenos Aires, Argentina, was recorded and released on the live album, Sticky & Sweet Tour (2010).|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{see how it}} was done," [...] Miller repeated. [...] "Certainly she did {{not rise}} from her chair, not for an instant, and yet {{to believe that she}} did not have a hand in what took place is to admit the impossible. You have had other <b>sittings</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> haven't you? You believe in her?" ...|$|R

500|$|At Yekaterinburg, Tatiana {{occasionally}} {{joined her}} younger sisters in chatting {{with some of}} the guards over tea, asking them questions about their families and talking about her hopes for a new life in England when they were released. On one occasion one of the guards forgot himself and told the grand duchesses an off-color joke. The shocked Tatiana ran from the room, [...] "pale as death," [...] and her younger sister Maria scolded the guards for their bad language. She [...] "would be pleasant to the guards if she thought they were behaving in an acceptable and decorous manner," [...] recalled another of the guards in his memoirs. Later, when a new commander was placed in charge of the Ipatiev House, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the rules of their confinement became more strict. Tatiana, still the family leader, was often sent by her parents to question the guards about rules or what would happen next to the family. She also {{spent a great deal of}} time <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> mother and ill brother, reading to her mother or playing games to occupy the time. At the Ipatiev House, Tatiana and her sisters were required to do their own laundry and make bread. Her nursing skills were called upon at the end of June 1918 when she gave an injection of morphine to Dr. Eugene Botkin to ease his kidney pain.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} divided into four sections: Pimp, Old School, Gypsy and Rave. It began with [...] "The Sweet Machine", a 3D {{animation}} video displaying candy being manufactured and used as a Pinball. As the video ended, [...] "Candy Shop" [...] began with Madonna appearing on a M-shaped throne in the Givenchy-designed dress, <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> legs spread apart and holding a staff in her hands. She was accompanied by her dancers in bondage themed costumes. [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] featured Madonna and her dancers on a 1935 Auburn Speedster while Pharrell Williams and Kanye West appeared on the backdrops. Madonna then played the electric guitar for [...] "Human Nature"; the performance featured a video of Britney Spears trapped in an elevator, who sang {{along with some of}} the verses in the song. A modernized [...] "Vogue", featuring the hook of [...] "4 Minutes", was the final song for this section. It led to a video interlude for [...] "Die Another Day", featuring Madonna as a boxer on screen, while her dancers performed a faux boxing match. The next section, inspired by the style and culture of early 1980s New York, began with Madonna skipping on stage for [...] "Into the Groove". This performance was a mashup with [...] "Toop Toop" [...] by Cassius and featured the artwork of friend Keith Haring. She then performed a double Dutch dance interlude which led to [...] "Heartbeat". During that song, Madonna's dance movements were controlled by her back-up dancers as if they were puppeteers. She performed [...] "Borderline" [...] in a rock version, on electric guitar. [...] "She's Not Me" [...] followed, where Madonna made fun of her various incarnations and styles, from the music videos of [...] "Open Your Heart", [...] "Material Girl", [...] "Vogue" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin". The section ended with [...] "Music" [...] which contained elements of [...] "Put Your Hands Up 4 Detroit" [...] and excerpts from [...] "Last Night a DJ Saved My Life". A short video was played featuring a tagged subway train. The doors of the train then closed to take in Madonna and her dancers. The [...] "Rain" [...] video interlude was played on the video screens; it featured an animated pixie finding shade under a petal during a rainstorm. This version contained musical elements from [...] "Here Comes the Rain Again" [...] by Eurythmics.|$|E
2500|$|His healing feats include {{getting rid}} of warts by wishing them on someone else, [...] "Someone who's already ugly with boil marks, I can fill up with warts." [...] He said he cured a man of heroin {{addiction}} and a woman of cystitis by laying {{his hands on her}} head and willing the affliction away. He is claimed to have cured a woman of cancer by <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> in a hospital for three days and nights, while holding her feet and pouring healing energy into her.|$|E

50|$|Hunt {{returned}} from his travels in 1856. Ford Madox Brown described Annie as 'siren-like' and <b>her</b> connection <b>with</b> Rossetti caused a rift between Rossetti and Hunt. Annie became involved with the seventh Viscount Ranelagh even though Hunt proposed to her. As a result, Hunt finally broke off the engagement in 1859. Thereafter Boyce and Rossetti competed for <b>sittings</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> Rossetti usually winning, though this caused Rossetti’s wife Elizabeth Siddal on one occasion to throw his drawings of Annie out of the window.|$|R
2500|$|Watson's The Double Helix {{almost entirely}} refers {{to her as}} [...] "Rosy", the name people at King's College used behind her back. She {{did not want to}} be called by that name because she had a {{great-aunt}} Rosy. In the family, she was called [...] "Ros". To others, she was simply [...] "Rosalind". She made it clear to an American visiting friend Dorothea Raacke, while <b>sitting</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> at Crick's table in The Eagle pub in Cambridge: Raacke asked her how she was to be called and she replied [...] "I'm afraid it will have to be Rosalind", adding [...] "Most definitely not Rosy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Behn was a {{political}} writer of fiction and for the stage, and though not didactic in purpose, most of her works have distinct political content. The timing of Oroonokos publication must be seen in its own context {{as well as in}} the larger literary tradition (see below). According to Charles Gildon, Aphra Behn wrote Oroonoko even with company present, and Behn's own account suggests that she wrote the novel in a single <b>sitting,</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> pen scarcely rising from the paper. If Behn travelled to Surinam in 1663–64, she felt no need for twenty-four years to write her [...] "American story" [...] and then felt a sudden and acute passion for telling it in 1688. It is therefore wise to consider what changes were in the air in that year that could account for the novel.|$|E
