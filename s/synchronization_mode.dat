Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) of a processor based on slowdown factors can lead to considerable energy savings. In this paper, we allow tasks to have different slowdown factors based on the task characteristics. We introduce the idea of frequency inheritance which is required to guarantee the task deadlines. We present the Dual Mode Frequency Inheritance (DMFI) algorithm under the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling policy. The two modes of operation are the independent mode and the <b>synchronization</b> <b>mode.</b> We prove that it is sufficient to execute in the <b>synchronization</b> <b>mode</b> for a shorter interval than that in the previous work, resulting in more energy savings. We formulate the problem of computing the slowdown factors for tasks as an optimization problem to minimize the total energy consumption of the system. Our simulation experiments show on an average 10 % energy gains over the known slowdown techniques...|$|E

To achieve this goal, seventeen participants had to synchronize a self-moved circle, representing the arm movement, with a visual target signal corresponding to five temporally shifted visual feedback conditions (0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of the target cycle duration) in three synchronization modes (in-phase, anti-phase and intermediate). The {{results showed that the}} perception of a newly generated perceptual Gestalt between the visual feedback of the arm and the target signal facilitated the synchronization performance in the preferred in-phase <b>synchronization</b> <b>mode</b> in contrast to the less stable anti-phase and intermediate mode.

They often beat in synchrony and may transition between different <b>synchronization</b> <b>modes</b> in the same cell type. Here, we investigate the behavior of elastic microfilaments, protruding from a surface and driven at their base by a configuration-dependent torque. We consider full hydrodynamic interactions among and within filaments and no slip at the surface. Isolated filaments exhibit periodic deformations, with increasing waviness and frequency as {{the magnitude of the}} driving torque increases. Two nearby but independently-driven filaments synchronize their beating in-phase or anti-phase. This synchrony arises autonomously via the interplay between hydrodynamic coupling and filament elasticity. Importantly, in-phase and anti-phase <b>synchronization</b> <b>modes</b> are bistable and co-exist for a range of driving torques and separation distances.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of parallelization is speed up. As {{the number of}} {{processors}} increases, {{there is a little}} or no speedup, since a performance threshold is reached for a fixed problem size. This is because scalability for a parallel program is limited by the communication and synchronization overhead. Slipstream multiprocessor runs two redundant copies of the same program in a chip multiprocessor, where one program runs ahead of the other. The leading program is called the A-Stream and the trailing one is the R-Stream. The A-Stream, which runs ahead, is used to reduce overhead and improve the efficiency of execution rather than to increase concurrency. Prefetching of shared data by the A-Stream for the R-Stream helps the whole unit to speedup. AR-Synchronization limits the movement of the leading program (A-Stream). The user can choose the type of synchronization desired at the beginning of program execution. A program might benefit if we vary the <b>synchronization</b> <b>mode</b> with different regions of code. This thesis proposes a technique to make the <b>synchronization</b> <b>mode</b> dynamic. This thesis implements a method to check whether it is possible to change synchronization method dynamically. This method incurs some overhead which we avoid when we implement the sliding-window method to eliminate aggressive switching. Using dynamic AR-Synchronization with the sliding- window approach results in a 7. 9 % improvement in execution time for the OCEAN benchmark, a 10 % improvement for SOR, and a 0. 2 % improvement for MG.

This study is motivated by recent experiments on synthetic and biological swimmers in microfluidic Hele-Shaw type geometries. Under such confinement, a swimmer's hydrodynamic signature is that of a potential source dipole, and the long-range interactions among swimmers are obtained from the superposition of dipole singularities. Here, we recall the equations governing the positions and orientations of interacting asymmetric swimmers in doubly-periodic domains, and focus on the dynamics of swimmer pairs. We obtain two families of `relative equilibria'-type solutions that correspond to pursuit and synchronization of the two swimmers, respectively.

Focusing on the adaptive playout with time-scale modification, we adopt the adaptive playout to help both intra-client and inter-client synchronization in a multicast streaming environment. However, only the usability of adaptive playout in assisting the synchronized multicast streaming is demonstrated while leaving several detailed issues untouched. As an effort to enhance the proposed framework, in this paper, we concentrate on refining the adaptive playout between two (i. e., intra/inter) synchronization modes. We attempt to enhance each <b>synchronization</b> <b>mode</b> and enable appropriate switching between them.

As the multi-core architectures have become prevalent, a major question that has emerged {{about the use of}} MPI within a compute node and its impact on communication costs. The one-sided communication interface in MPI provides a mechanism to reduce communication costs by removing matching requirements of the send/receive model. The MPI standard provides the flexibility to allocate memory windows backed by shared memory. However, state-of-the-art open-source MPI libraries do not leverage this optimization opportunity for commodity clusters. In this paper, we present a design and implementation of intra-node MPI one-sided interface using shared memory backed windows on multi-core clusters.
