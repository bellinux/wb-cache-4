30|$|The typical {{real-world}} {{scenario is}} that multiple pipe spools are fabricated simultaneously in one <b>shop,</b> <b>sharing</b> the same labor resources and drawing {{from the same}} inventory for most raw materials.

As shown above, various types of raw materials (e.g., pipe sections of different sizes, elbows, olets and flanges) are connected in the spool fabrication process. Timely supply of all materials is critical to achieve the smooth execution of the fabrication process. Any delay in material supply processes would postpone start time on corresponding activities, potentially extending the project duration.|$|R
