5|$|On May 20, 2015, The New York Times {{reported}} that Zayat had sold breeding {{rights to the}} colt to the Ashford Stud, a division of Ireland's Coolmore Stud, but retained control over the colt and his racing career. Before the announcement, offers for American Pharoah's breeding rights reportedly exceeded $20 million. After the Belmont, Forbes magazine {{reported that}} Zayat had actually sold the breeding rights to Ashford in late 2014, long before he began his Triple Crown run, and that Zayat retained 100% of the racing rights. Forbes went on to estimate that if American Pharoah stood for a $100,000 <b>stud</b> <b>fee,</b> he could be worth $50 million. More conservative estimates placed his potential <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> at $75,000 and his potential value at about $25 to $36 million. The New York Times said that breeding rights had been sold for $13.8 million: $9.8 million with an additional $4 million incentive if American Pharoah won the Belmont Stakes. Zayat retained an undisclosed percentage in the colt's breeding career, and explained that American Pharoah would retire from racing {{at the end of}} 2015.|$|E

25|$|Archer was {{retired to}} <b>stud</b> at a <b>fee</b> of 10 guineas per mare (one {{of the highest}} <b>stud</b> <b>fees</b> of the time), but his progeny did not win a stakes race. He {{remained}} at Exeter Farm until his death at age 16 on 22 December 1872. He had wandered into a field of green barley, the consumption of which gave him a fatal inflammation of the lungs. Archer's jockey, John Cutts, had died three months earlier in September 1872.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>stud</b> <b>fees</b> do {{not include}} the costs of {{boarding}} the female animal at the location of the stud animal, or of the cost of collecting and shipping semen if artificial insemination is used in lieu of live cover. Any veterinary expenses or medications are also an additional cost to the owner of the female animal.|$|R
5|$|Blacklock was {{retired to}} stud, {{where he became}} a {{successful}} stallion. He first stood at Bishop Burton in Yorkshire, with his fee initially set at 15 guineas and half a guinea for the groom (Thomas Barrow). He was then leased to Thomas Kirkby in York for four seasons where he stood for a much lower fee. In 1827 he was at Bildeston in Suffolk and was commanding a <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> of twelve guineas. His fee reached up to 25 guineas.|$|E
5|$|Wizard was a {{stallion}} at Elmsal Lodge near Ferrybridge, Yorkshire. In 1812 his <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> was ten guineas plus half a guinea for the groom. He also {{stood at}} Emsal, {{for the same}} fee, in 1813. He only stood as a stallion for these two seasons and died on 30 June 1813 at Elmsal Lodge two days after running into a post. He broke three ribs and an iron bar attached to the post became so lodged in his backbone that it took two men to remove it. Wizard sired three winners of eleven races.|$|E
5|$|Orme was {{retired to}} stud {{at the end}} of his four-year-old season, and on 26 October 1893 he left Newmarket for Eaton Stud. His first {{covering}} was St. Mary, a daughter of Hermit, which resulted in his first foal (a chestnut colt) being born in January 1895. His <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> for 1898 was 200 guineas, plus one guinea for the groom. Orme became a successful stallion and was champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland in 1899, with more than double the winnings of any other sire that year, largely thanks to his son Flying Fox. His son Duke of Westminster was sold for £20,050 as a two-year-old. His fee was still 200 guineas in 1902. In total Orme sired 242 winners of races worth a total of £122,568.|$|E
50|$|Men in the castles {{engage in}} {{constant}} sporting competitions, {{some of which}} are quite violent. The castles are supported by <b>stud</b> <b>fees</b> paid by their female customers. Women identify the lovers they wish to hire during the numerous public sporting events. If a woman conceives an additional fee is paid to the castle. Women marry only other women, and men do not marry.|$|R
50|$|Following his {{retirement}} as a player, Keller founded Yankeeland Farm {{and had a}} successful career as a horse breeder - pacers and trotters - near his hometown of Middletown, Maryland. He named many of his horses after the franchises he played for: Fresh Yankee, Handsome Yankee, Yankee Slugger and Guy Yankee. He also benefited by owning syndicated shares of several stallions, which entitled him to free <b>stud</b> <b>fees.</b>|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the narrow}} view of men by women on Seggri, men are greatly admired for their beauty and {{physical}} prowess. Some women spend {{vast amount of}} money hiring men as studs (apparently men are only available in this way for a fee).

Like rock stars, the high <b>stud</b> <b>fees</b> commanded by champion athletes makes them unattainable {{for the vast majority of}} women.|$|R
25|$|As a stallion's career, either {{performance}} or breeding, improves, his <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> tends {{to increase in}} proportion. If one or two offspring are especially successful, winning several stakes races or an Olympic medal, the <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> will generally greatly increase. Younger, unproven stallions will generally have a lower <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> earlier on in their careers.|$|E

His 2013 <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> was set at £125,000. In his first season as a stallion he covered 133 mares, including 2011 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Danedream, three times Nassau Stakes winner Midday, and 2011 Kentucky Broodmare of the year Oatsee. Of those, 126 were scanned as in foal for a fertility rate of 95 percent. On 16 June 2014, Frankel's first foal {{to be sent to}} auction was sold for £1.15 million.|$|E
25|$|Danehill Dancer was {{retired to}} {{stand as a}} {{stallion}} at Coolmore Stud in 1997, with his <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> initially set at Ir£4,000, and he traveled to stand at Coolmore's Australian stud for the Southern Hemisphere breeding season. In 1997, he never covered any mares in Europe, as {{he was still in}} training, but did travel to Australia to cover mares there, although he did not produce any top-class foals that year. Danehill Dancer sired three Group 1 winners from his 1999 foals, including Choisir, who was a top-class sprinter in both Australia and Great Britain, winning the Lightning Stakes, King's Stand Stakes and Golden Jubilee Stakes. He now stands at stud for Coolmore in Ireland for a fee of €12,500 and shuttles to Australia for the southern hemisphere spring, where his <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> is $29,700. His best progeny so far are Olympic Glory, Sacred Choice and Starspangledbanner. The other Group 1 winners from Danehill Dancer's first crop were Private Steer (Stradbroke Handicap, Doncaster Handicap and All Aged Stakes) and Where or When (Queen Elizabeth II Stakes). Danehill Dancer did not produce any horses that scored at the top level for a few seasons until Speciosa (foaled 2003) won the 1000 Guineas in 2006. She later finished fourth in the Oaks and second in the Pretty Polly Stakes. Danehill Dancer's 2004 crop included Alexander Tango (Garden City Handicap), Arapaho Miss (Crown Oaks), Light Fantastic (Australian Guineas), Miss Beatrix (Moyglare Stud Stakes) and Risky Business (Singapore Gold Cup). The following season he produced Atomic Force (The Galaxy and Railway Stakes) and Super Satin (Hong Kong Derby).|$|E
5000|$|The {{value of}} a Thoroughbred may be {{influenced}} by the purse money it wins. In 2007, Thoroughbred racehorses earned a total of $1,217,854,602 in all placings, an average earnings per starter of $16,924. [...] In addition, the track record of a race horse may influence its future value as a breeding animal. <b>Stud</b> <b>fees</b> for stallions that enter breeding can range from $2,500 to $300,000 per mare in the United States, and from ₤2000 pounds to £75,000 pounds or more in Britain.|$|R

50|$|Hatley {{was named}} {{executive}} secretary in 1947, while also {{a sophomore at}} the University of Idaho. Shortly after, the ApHC office {{was moved to the}} Hatley's Moscow home. For a time, <b>stud</b> <b>fees</b> from Hatley's Appaloosa stallion were used to help finance the ApHC. Hatley and Francis Haines began the process of publishing the ApHC's first stud book. By 1948 the ApHC had 296 registered horses, ranking ninth in annual registrations among light-horse breeds. The first official membership meeting and election of national directors occurred June 19, 1948, before the first National Show.|$|R
25|$|The highest {{stud fees}} are {{generally}} for racing Thoroughbreds, which may charge {{from two to}} three thousand dollars for a breeding to a new or unproven stallion, to {{several hundred thousand dollars}} for a breeding to a proven producer of stakes winners. Stallions in other disciplines often have stud fees that begin in the range of $1,000 to $3,000, with top contenders who produce champions in certain disciplines able to command as much as $20,000 for one breeding. The lowest stud fees to breed to a grade horse or an animal of low-quality pedigree may only be $100–$200, but there are trade-offs: the horse will probably be unproven, and likely to produce lower-quality offspring than a horse with a <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> that is in the typical range for quality breeding stock.|$|E
25|$|Dan Patch retired undefeated in 1909 as {{the holder}} of nine world records, and {{spent much of}} his later life {{attending}} exhibitions. Even during his racing career, he was used for stallion duty with a <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> of between $300 and $500, though he was never exposed to the best mares. He had a moderately successful stud career but never sired a horse close to his ability. He sired 38 trotters who met the 2m:30s standard with 1 breaking 2:10. He also sired 138 pacers who met the standard, 5 of whom broke the 2:05 barrier. Dazzle Patch was his most successful son but died young and left only a few foals behind. Dan Patch's name is rare in modern pedigrees. His most famous descendant is Hall of Famer Jate Lobell, who traces to Dan Patch's daughter Theda Patch in the female line.|$|E
25|$|Carry Back, a {{dark brown}} horse, raced {{in the blue}} and silver colors of retired {{manufacturer}} Jack Price, who bred the colt at the Ocala Stud in Marion County, Florida. Price trained the colt for his wife, Katherine. In early 1958, Price took over ownership of an obscure mare named Joppy for a fee of $150 plus a $150 overdue board bill at his Ohio farm. Joppy's racing record was poor. In seven starts, she finished second twice and earned only $325. Joppy was eventually banned from racing, {{a result of her}} frequent refusals to leave the starting gate. For a modest $400 <b>stud</b> <b>fee,</b> Price bred Joppy to a stallion named Saggy. Saggy's only real claim to fame was that in April 1948 he handed Citation the only loss of his Triple Crown winning season with a one length win in the Chesapeake Trial at Havre de Grace Racetrack.|$|E

25|$|In Laihia, Eri-Aaroni sired {{dozen of}} foals each year, {{and more than}} 200 during the best years. His <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> was {{exceptionally}} high, 15000 marks, corresponding to about 5000 Euros. He sired more than 1100 offspring, of which 73 became suur-, 24 huippu-, and 22 tähtijuoksija. Of his first generation offspring, 4 stallions and 1 mare became winners of Kuninkuusravit titles; 6 stallions and 11 mares were made breeding champions; 167 stallions and 381 mares were accepted for the Finnhorse studbook. In state horse shows, Eri-Aaroni was finally rewarded when three times he was granted the first prize for his offspring. In 1952 {{he was one of}} the first horses to ever receive the title of a breeding champion.
