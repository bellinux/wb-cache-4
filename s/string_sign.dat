Previously {{it has been shown}} by density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method that a single doped hole is always self-localized due to the quantum destructive interference of the phase <b>string</b> <b>signs</b> hidden in the t-J ladders. Here we report a DMRG investigation of hole binding in the same model, where a novel pairing-glue scheme beyond the BCS realm is discovered. Specifically, we show that, in addition to spin pairing due to superexchange interaction, the strong frustration of the phase <b>string</b> <b>signs</b> on the kinetic energy gets effectively removed by pairing the charges, which results in strong binding of two holes. By contrast, if the phase <b>string</b> <b>signs</b> are switched off artificially, the pairing strength diminishes significantly even if the superexchange coupling remains the same. In the latter, unpaired holes behave like coherent quasiparticles with pairing drastically weakened, whose sole origin may be attributed to the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) pairing of spins. Such non-BCS pairing mechanism is therefore beyond the RVB picture and may shed important light on the high-T_c cuprate superconductors. Comment: 8 + 2 pages, 6 + 4 figure...|$|R

BackgroundPresence of <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> is a well-known factor for adverse events in patients with severe carotid artery disease undergoing CAS. MethodsWe used retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients who underwent carotid angiography with the intention to undergo carotid stenting and had angiographically documented <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> in the target lesion. ResultsFrom October 2006 to August 2007, 25 patients (21 men and 4 women, mean age 70. 9 ± 8. 7 years) presented with <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> during carotid angiography. This was 6. 0 % of a total of 416 patients studied during the time of the study. Twenty patients (80. 0 %) were symptomatic, and 5 (20. 0 %) were asymptomatic. Carotid artery stenting was performed successively in all patients. Proximal cerebral protection was applied in all but 1 patient. The 30 -day death/stroke rate was 0 %. At 12 -month follow-up neurological events did not occur; 1 patient developed a nonfatal myocardial infarction, and another patient died from noncardiac cause. The 12 -month death/stroke rate was 4. 0 %.

40|$|Background: Intracranial {{vertebral}} artery dissection (VAD) is a well-recognized cause of stroke in young and middle-aged individuals, especially in Asian populations. However, a long-term natural course remains unclear. We investigated the long-term time course of VAD using imaging findings {{to examine the}} rate and predisposing factors for improvement. Methods: We registered 56 consecutive patients (40 males; mean age, 51. 8 ± 10. 7 years) with acute spontaneous VAD and retrospectively investigated neuroimaging and clinical course within 1 month and at 3 months ± 2 weeks, 6 months ± 2 weeks, and 12 months ± 2 weeks after onset to ascertain predisposing factors and time course for improvement. Results: The most common presenting symptoms were headache and/or posterior neck pain, seen in 41 patients (73 %). Magnetic resonance imaging showed brainstem and/or cerebellum infarction in only 32 patients (57 %). Of the 56 VADs, 16 (28 %) presented with pearl and <b>string</b> <b>sign,</b> 5 (9 %) with pearl sign, 15 (27 %) with <b>string</b> <b>sign,</b> and 20 (36 %) with occlusion sign. VAD occurred on the dominant side in 20 patients and on the nondominant side in the other 36 patients. The pearl and <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> was more frequently noted on the dominant side than on the nondominant side (50 vs. 17 %, p = 0. 008). On the other hand, occlusion occurred more often on the nondominant side than on the dominant side (47 vs. 15 %, p = 0. 016). Furthermore, the pearl and <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> {{was more frequently seen}} in the improvement group (41 vs. 15 %, p = 0. 028), whereas the occlusion sign was evident more frequently in the nonimprovement group (21 vs. 52 %, p = 0. 015). Follow-up neuroimaging evaluation was performed at 1 and 3 months in 91 % each, and at 6 and 12 months in 82 % each. VAD aggravation was identified within 1 month after onset in 14 %, while VAD improvement was seen in 14, 38, 50, and 52 % at each period, mainly within 6 months after onset. Older patients and current smoking were negatively associated with VAD improvement. Conclusions: VAD improvement primarily occurs within 6 months after onset, and VAD aggravation within 1 month. It seems that older patients and current smoking are negative predictors of VAD improvement as risk factors, and as image findings, the pearl and <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> is a positive predictor and occlusion a negative predictor...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our {{purpose was}} to {{describe}} {{a variant of the}} carotid <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> that may be associated with a completely occluded vessel and to consider possible patho-physiological mechanisms for this observation. METHODS: Carotid angiography was performed in three patients with suspected carotid stenosis and in a fourth with carotid dissection. Surgery was performed in one of the patients with carotid stenosis. RESULTS: On all angiograms, instead of a single linear or curvilinear contrast ‘‘string,’’ either single or multiple serpiginous channels were seen. In one case, such a channel was seen emanating from below the origin of an occluded internal carotid stump, reconstituting the distal portion of the vessel. Surgery revealed a completely occluded lumen with a small intramural vessel bypassing the obstruction. CONCLUSION: We propose that these channels are either atherosclerotically induced neo-vessels connecting bridging vasa vasorum or recanalized luminal thrombus.

40|$|Introduction: The {{efficacy}} of {{coronary artery bypass}} graft (CABG) surgery for patients with ischemic heart disease is dependent on the patency of the selected conduit. The left internal thoracic artery is considered to be the best conduit for CABG. However, the preferred conduit between the radial artery (RA) and saphenous vein (SV) remains controversial. The present meta-analysis aims to establish the current level IA evidence on patency outcomes comparing the RA and SV. Methods: Electronic searches were performed using 6 databases from their inception to March 2012. Two reviewers independently identified all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patency outcomes of RA and SV grafts after CABG. Data were extracted and meta-analyzed according to angiographic end points at specified follow-up intervals. Results: Five relevant RCTs were identified for inclusion in the present meta-analysis.

40|$|Abstract Background The left {{internal}} mammary artery (LIMA) is {{the choice}} for grafting of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). One possible mechanism of the rare graft failure involve the presence of competitive flow. Method 105 patients who had undergone coronary bypass grafting between 1998 and 2000 were included in this observational study. The recatheterizations were performed 28 months after the operations. The rate of patency the LIMA grafts was determined, and the cases with graft failure were analyzed. Results The LIMA graft was patent in 99 patients (94 %). Six patients (6 %) exhibited diffuse involution of the graft (<b>string</b> <b>sign).</b> The <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> was always associated with competitive flow {{as the basis of}} the LIMA graft involution. In one case quantitative re-evaluation of the preoperative coronary angiography revealed merely less than 50 % diameter stenosis on the LAD with a nonligated side-branch of the LIMA. At recatheterization in two patients the pressure wire measurements demonstrated only a non-significant decrease of the fractional flow reserve (0. 83 and 0. 89), despite the 53 % and 57 % diameter stenosis in the angiogram. Another patient displayeda significant regression of the LAD lesion between the pre- and postoperative coronary angiography (from 76 % to 44 %) as the cause of the development of the competitive flow. In one instance, a radial artery graft on the LAD during a redo bypass operation resulted in competitive flow in the radial graft due to the greater diameter than that of the LIMA. In a further patient, competitive flow developed from a short sequential part of the LIMA graft between the nonsignificantly stenosed diagonal branch and the LAD, with involution of {{the main part of the}} graft to the diagonal branch. Conclusions The most common cause of the development of the <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> of a LIMA graft due to competitive flow is overassessment of the lesion of the LAD. Regression of a previous lesion or some other neighboring graft can also cause the phenomenon. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGrafting an {{internal}} thoracic artery to a coronary artery with moderate stenosis remains controversial. Competitive flow from the native coronary artery has been proposed {{as the cause of}} distal narrowing and ultimate failure of the {{internal thoracic artery}} graft. We investigated intraoperative phasic blood flow in internal thoracic arteries grafted to coronary arteries with various degrees of stenosis and the influence of stenosis on postoperative angiographic findings. One hundred patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting of {{an internal}} thoracic artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery were divided into three groups according to degree of coronary stenosis. Group 1 included 39 patients who had 75 % or less stenosis, group 2 included 34 patients with stenosis from 76 % to 90 %, and group 3 included 27 patients with stenosis greater than 90 %. Mean flow and peak systolic flow of internal thoracic artery graft in group 1 were lower than those in group 2 (p < 0. 01, p < 0. 05). Peak diastolic flow in group 1 showed no difference from flows in groups 2 and 3. In eight patients in group 1, internal thoracic artery flow showed a predominant diastolic peak with characteristic systolic reversal as a result of competitive flow from the native coronary artery. Angiography at 1 month showed that the internal thoracic artery graft was patent in every case. Relative contributions of native coronary artery and internal thoracic artery flow to distal perfusion differed among the three groups (p < 0. 001). In group 1, 15 % of patients showed native-dominant flow, 62 % showed balanced flow, and 23 % showed internal thoracic artery–dependent flow. In group 2, 9 % of patients showed native-dominant flow, 29 % showed balanced flow, and 62 % showed internal thoracic artery–dependent flow. In group 3, 96 % of patients showed internal thoracic artery–dependent flow. <b>String</b> <b>sign</b> of the internal thoracic artery graft developed in only three patients; in two of these patients internal thoracic arteries were grafted to coronary arteries with stenosis of 50 % or less and in the other patient there was competitive flow from a diagonal vein graft.

A mortalidade hospitalar foi de 2 (6 %) casos, sendo ambos de causa não cardíaca. Reestudo angiográfico antes da alta hospitalar foi realizado em todos os pacientes que sobreviveram, demonstrando enxertos patentes em 96 % (46 / 48). Dois enxertos exibiram espasmo moderado relacionado à ponta do cateter, um apresentou espasmo acentuado e dois demonstraram a presença de <b>string</b> <b>sign.</b> Oito pacientes com evolução pós-operatória tardia superior a 6 meses foram submetidos a reestudo angiográfico seqüencial, com enxertos pérvios em 100 %, sem nenhuma anormalidade detectável.

Os resultados aqui obtidos nos permitem afirmar que a RA pode ser uma excelente opção para pacientes com varizes dos MMII ou ausência de veias safenas. O seguimento clínico mais prolongado nos ajudará a determinar o real valor da RA como enxerto aorto-coronário. From 4 / 8 / 94 thru 2 / 28 / 95, 32 {{patients were}} submitted to myocardial revascularization utilizing the radial artery graft (RA) {{as part of}} the procedure. This represented 17. 3 % of our coronary bypass surgery experience during that period. Twenty three patients were male and mean age was 56. 8 years (41 - 74). The RA was used to graft the anterior interventricular area in 7 cases, right coronary artery in 7 cases and circunflex in 18 cases. Two patients died, for a hospital mortality of 6 %, being of non-cardiac causes in both. Angiographyc control was done in all hospital survivors before discharge, revealing 96 % of graft patency rate (46 / 48).

We evaluated the use of multidetector CT angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction (3 D-CTA) as a noninvasive screening tool for prospective CAS patients. MethodsBetween 2003 and 2006, 90 CAS procedures were performed by vascular surgeons at our institution. At {{the discretion of the}} operating surgeon, 59 of the potential candidates for CAS underwent screening 3 D-CTA of the aortic arch and carotid arteries. Results were used in patient selection and then analyzed retrospectively to determine clinical utility. ResultsAnalysis of 3 D-CTA data by the operating surgeon allowed stratification of patients into four groups: (1) appropriate for CAS via femoral approach (n = 37, 63 %); (2) appropriate for CAS with transcervical access due to adverse arch anatomy (n = 2, 3 %); (3) borderline anatomy for CAS (n = 5, 9 %); or (4) not appropriate anatomy for CAS (n = 15, 25 %). Group 1 had 100 % technical success with one minor stroke. Group 2 had successful transcervical CAS without stroke. Group 3 patients underwent arteriography but CAS was aborted in four out of five cases {{for the same reason that}} had been identified by 3 D-CTA (internal carotid artery [ICA] tortuosity n = 2, ICA <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> with distal disease n = 2). The one failure in group 3 was the result of a previously placed common carotid stent extending into an already unfavorable aortic arch. Group 4 patients underwent endarterectomy (n = 7) or continued medical management (n = 8) instead of CAS (without arteriography) because of the following reasons, cited alone or in combination: common carotid tandem stenosis n = 5, difficult arch anatomy n = 2, ICA tortuosity n = 2, extreme lesion calcification or length n = 4, ICA <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> or occlusion n = 3, concomitant intracranial disease n = 2, and stenosis overestimated by duplex n = 3. The overall 30 -day stroke rate, on an intention to treat basis, for patients that underwent preprocedural 3 D-CTA was 2. 3 % (one major [NIH stroke scale > 3] and one minor stroke). ConclusionsIn our initial experience, 3 D-CTA reconstruction of the aortic arch and carotid arteries significantly influenced the plan for CAS in 37 % of patients. Patients with clear anatomic contraindications to CAS can be excluded without the risks of arteriography. 3 D-CTA further facilitates the CAS procedure by anticipating potential procedural.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare 2 {{different}} surgical {{approaches to}} treatment {{of patients with}} isolated predivisional stenosis of the left main coronary artery (IOSLM) and to evaluate the effect of chronic competitive flow from a patent arterial or venous graft to the circumflex system on the long-term patency of internal thoracic artery (ITA) to left anterior descending grafts. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with IOSLM were treated at our institutions during a 9 -year period: 14 patients received double ITA grafts, whereas 18 underwent ITA graft plus saphenous vein (SV) bypass. All patients were reviewed clinically and angiographically at long-term follow-up. RESULTS: No patient died during hospitalization. At a mean follow-up of 96 ± 9 months 7 patients had died (6 from noncardiac causes) and 5 had experienced angina/ischemia recurrence, without differences between the 2 revascularization strategies. At control reangiography all ITA and SV grafts {{were found to be}} fully patent, without evidence of caliber reduction or <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> in the ITA. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IOSLM, long-term ITA to left anterior descending artery patency is not jeopardized by chronic flow competition from a concomitant arterial or venous graft to the circumflex system. Notably, the addition of a second ITA graft or of a SV to the first ITA does not lead to differences in long-term angiographic patency. Our results minimize the role of flow competition in this setting and should be kept in mind when choosing the appropriate graft configuration...|$|E

Surveillance angiography was performed {{as part of a}} randomized trial. All available lipid assays were collected from pathology laboratories, and from these, mean annualized lipid exposure was calculated for total choles-terol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides. Angiographical and clinical data were analysed against lipid exposure. Graft failure was defined as occlu-sion, <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> or> 80 % stenosis. RESULTS: Six thousand and seventy-seven lipid measurements were obtained, and there were 154 failed grafts. Three hundred and eleven patients received at least one vein graft, and all 413 patients received at least one arterial graft. Overall, only HDL levels were inversely cor-related with graft failure, with total cholesterol and LDL showing no associations in a mixed pool of arterial and venous grafts. To assess whether total/LDL cholesterol had no effect or were exerting competing effects in arteries and veins, separate multivariate analyses were performed. Venous graft failure was associated with increased total cholesterol/HDL (P = 0. 006) and LDL/HDL (P = 0. 032). By contrast, elevated total cholesterol was correlated with a reduced risk of arterial graft failure (OR for graft failure 0. 705, P = 0. 023) with increasing LDL cholesterol following a similar trend (OR for graft failure 0. 729, P = 0. 051) ...|$|E

We focus on the half-filling case as an example to illustrate why such a generic sign structure is important to understand the transition from the weakly correlated Fermi liquid regime to the strongly correlated Mott regime. In particular, we show that an electron fractionalization scheme with emergent partons and mutual Chern-Simons gauge fields provides a suitable framework to accurately handle the singular sign structure in two dimensions. A ground state ansatz at half-filling with incorporating the sign structure and the specific electron fractionalization is also proposed.

40|$|ObjectiveSome {{arterial}} grafts have progressive narrowing or occlusion {{during the}} first postoperative year despite angiographic patency in the immediate postoperative period. This study analyzed the incidence and predictors of arterial graft deterioration. MethodsWe reviewed 778 distal anastomoses of arterial grafts in 243 patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. All patients underwent both early and 1 -year follow-up coronary angiography, with all arterial grafts patent on the early angiograms. Arterial graft deterioration was defined as diffuse graft stenosis or occlusion newly found at 1 -year follow-up angiography. ResultsGraft deterioration was present in 13. 8 % (<b>string</b> <b>sign,</b> 6. 9 %; occlusion, 6. 8 %) of distal anastomoses. The incidence of graft deterioration was higher among cases of non–internal thoracic arterial graft (27. 7 % vs 6. 0 %, P < . 001), non–left anterior descending coronary arterial anastomosis (19. 1 % vs 2. 0 %, P < . 001), mild (≤ 75 %) stenosis of the target coronary artery (26. 0 % vs 7. 6 %, P < . 001), composite grafting (19. 9 % vs 7. 8 %, P < . 001), and multiple anastomoses from a single inflow source (19. 5 % vs 5. 1 %, P < . 001). The incidence was particularly high when composite or multiple grafting from a single inflow source was performed to a target coronary artery with mild stenosis. Non–internal thoracic arterial graft, mild target stenosis, and multiple grafting from a single inflow source were independent predictors of graft deterioration. ConclusionsArterial graft deterioration was closely related to particular graft materials and designs...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{how often}} delayed images, obtained during neurovascular CTA, provide unique information relative to early phase imaging alone. Materials and Methods: Informed consent was waived by {{the institutional review}} body for this study. Neurovascular CTAs from January through June 2009 were searched to identify those with delayed phase imaging. Reports were reviewed to identify cases where delayed images provided potentially unique information. The studies with potentially unique information were re-interpreted {{to determine if the}} information was indeed unique. Results: 645 CTAs with delayed phase imaging were identified. There were 324 men and 310 women (median age 67 years; range 20 – 96 years). 59 studies (59 / 645 : 9. 1 %) had findings on the delayed images. There were 13 cases with hemorrhage, with 4 showing progression on delayed views. Of the remaining 46 cases, 28 had occlusion of a vessel that did not reconstitute on the delayed images, 6 had occlusion of a vessel that did reconstitute on the delayed images, 7 had a <b>string</b> <b>sign</b> which was unchanged on the delayed views and 5 had no abnormal findings. Thus in 10 cases the findings were unique to the delayed images (10 / 645 : 1. 55 %). Four showed active bleeding, three showed proximal occlusion with distal internal carotid filling from ophthalmic collaterals, two showed pial vessels filling distal to proximal MCA occlusion, and one showed retrograde vertebral artery filling due to subclavian steal. 95 % confidence limits of the expected incidence o...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the optimum conduit for coronary targets {{other than the}} left anterior descending artery, we evaluated long-term patencies and clinical outcomes of the radial artery, right internal thoracic artery, and saphenous vein through the Radial Artery Patency and Clinical Outcomes trial. MethodsAs part of a 10 -year prospective, randomized, single-center trial, patients undergoing primary coronary surgery were allocated to the radial artery (n = 198) or free right internal thoracic artery (n = 196) if aged less than 70 years (group 1), or radial artery (n = 113) or saphenous vein (n = 112) if aged at least 70 years (group 2). All patients received a left internal thoracic artery to the left anterior descending, and the randomized conduit was used to graft the second largest target. Protocol-directed angiography has been performed at randomly assigned intervals, weighted {{toward the end of}} the study period. Grafts are defined as failed if there was occlusion, <b>string</b> <b>sign,</b> or greater than 80 % stenosis, independently reported by 3 assessors. Analysis is by intention to treat. ResultsAt mean follow up of 5. 5 years, protocol angiography has been performed in groups 1 and 2 in 237 and 113 patients, respectively. There are no significant differences within each group in preoperative comorbidity, age, or urgency. Patencies were similar for either of the 2 conduits in each group (log rank analysis, P =. 06 and P =. 54, respectively). The differences in estimated 5 -year patencies were 6. 6 % (radial minus right internal thoracic artery) in group 1 and 2. 9 % (radial minus saphenous vein graft) in group 2. ConclusionAt mean 5 -year angiography in largely asymptomatic patients, the selection of arterial or venous conduit for the second graft has not significantly affected patency. This finding offers surgeons, for now, enhanced flexibility in planning revascularization...|$|E
