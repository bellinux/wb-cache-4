40|$|In {{this paper}} two digital filters {{are applied to}} {{elaborate}} acceleration data acquired from two accelerometers fixed in a lift frame during <b>safety</b> <b>gears</b> tests. The experimental tests consist in free falls of a test lift car and the subsequent gripping phases initiated by the <b>safety</b> <b>gears</b> activation due to over-speed condition. Unfortunately, the reliability of acceleration data is heavily impaired by measurement noise, which needs to be suppressed to the largest extent possible {{in order to use}} the data for comfort evaluation. To this end, two classes of digital filters are tested: the Savitzky–Golay and the Butterworth filters. This choice is motivated by the key features of these filters, including their computational simplicity and high suitability to represent time varying features in acceleration measurements. A tuning procedure is proposed for these filters, such that the measurement noise corrupting the experimental data is maximally dumped...|$|E
40|$|Construction practitioners’ world – wide are {{increasingly}} becoming {{aware that they}} cannot concentrate primarily on {{the technical aspects of}} the industry alone and ignoring the workers and others who may be adversely affected by construction activities. In most developing countries, including Tanzania, safety consideration in the construction project delivery is not given a high priority. The current approach is that safety interventions occur in response to specific, often major accidents or injury. The main objective of this research is to scrutinize why road and building construction industries in Tanzania have paid little attention to the issues of health and safety in construction sites. Data was obtained from different literatures and fields. Secondary data collected from different sources including publication on health and safety, academic journals, books, official documents and reports from Government Ministries, Agencies, NGO’s and development partners. Conclusively people pay little attention to the things concerning health and safety issues in construction building sites. The absence of clear national health and safety policy to safeguard all issues regarding the welfare of the construction workers in the country is a challenge. The fact is construction industry is still suffering on how health and safety would be safely practiced in construction sites. So, we need to make a clear policy concerning health and safety in general with regards to the construction industry. Also training on health and safety to all stakeholders should be taken into account as well as introduction of <b>safety</b> <b>gears</b> to the workers on the field of construction building sites...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} {{risk factors for}} injury, injury prevalence, <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> use, and skating habits of adult recreational in-line skaters. METHODS: Randomly selected in-line skaters in 6 major US cities were interviewed. RESULTS: Only 6 % of skaters consistently wore all 4 recommended types of <b>safety</b> <b>gear.</b> Skaters with greater skating experience {{were more likely to}} perform tricks, wear less <b>safety</b> <b>gear,</b> and sustain an injury. CONCLUSION: More experienced adult recreational in-line skaters are at increased risk for injury. <b>Safety</b> <b>gear</b> use in alarmingly low in adult recreational in-line skaters, especially experienced skaters. Safe skating education programs should consider targeting this newly recognized at-risk skating population...|$|R

40|$|Elevators {{have been}} {{a key element of}} buildings, {{especially}} tall buildings, since their widespread use began in the 19 th century. As a matter of fact, high-rise buildings would not have existed without elevators. Elevators have a myriad of safety features and devices to ensure a safe journey for the passengers. One of these devices is the safety gear. <b>Safety</b> <b>gears</b> are emergency brakes that stop speeding elevators by gripping the guide rails. They are adjusted for a safe deceleration range by the technician during installation and exert a constant force. Due to their purely mechanical nature, once triggered, the safety gear is currently unable to actively adjust the braking force to counteract vibrations, to decelerate at different rates, or to stop the elevator at the closest landing. Therefore, the emergency braking event can be harsh and noticeable, leaving the passengers stuck in the elevator shaft after the braking event. This thesis aims to develop an intelligent safety gear system that is able to bring the elevator to a stop with a safe and adjustable deceleration rate. This was achieved by first, modeling a computer simulation of a small-scale elevator to be able to quickly simulate different braking event scenarios. Second, a small-scale elevator test rig was constructed to test the computer simulation with physical components. The test rig was validated by comparing its results with KONE’s high-rise safety gear test. The control system developed was able to safely stop the moving mass with the desired deceleration {{and a great deal of}} control over other parameters. Further development of the system could lead to a safer, more comfortable, and energy efficient elevator ride...|$|E
40|$|Industrial timber {{harvesting}} in plantation forests in Tanzania was solely performed by public agencies until mid 1980 ’s. During that period harvesting operations were labour-intensive and semi-mechanized, coupled with low production rates and high production costs. Following {{the privatization of}} forestry industries, logging is currently being carried out by private companies. This study was carried out to assess and compare working conditions, physical workload and productivity in logging operations under private and public logging regimes. Data were collected in Sao Hill Forest plantations from a clear felling operation being carried out in a 26 years old Pinus patula stand. Time study was undertaken for tree cutting, skidding, manual bunching and loading operations. Physical workload data were obtained through heart rate measurement by using portable electronic heart rate monitor. Working conditions were assessed through ergonomic checklist administered to 45 loggers. The {{results indicated that the}} productivity in tree cutting averaged 4. 7 m 3 /h and 3. 4 m 3 /h for chainsaw and crosscut operations respectively, while in bunching and loading the respective values of 5. 1 m 3 /h and 11. 3 m 3 /h made higher production on the private regime as compared to the public. The working conditions were generally poor with low safety, inadequate payment and poor working tools coupled with high labour turnover. The physical workload was 78 % and 65 % heart rate increase for crosscut saw and chainsaw crews. This is a slight increase compared to the public logging regime estimated at 65 % and 57 % increase for crosscut saw and chainsaw respectively. However, the increased productivity observed in the private regime was not due to improved working conditions, but rather a result of the workers’ higher engagement and placed effort in performing production tasks. Training of the crews, improvement of payments, supervision and provision of <b>safety</b> <b>gears</b> are recommended for improved production and reduced occupational health hazards...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{kinetic energy}} of lift car will be {{consumed}} by the friction between the <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> and guide rail in emergent braking process. This will lead to remarkable temperate increase of frictional surface. Due to the explosive atmospheres in which the explosive-proof lift servers, the high temperature may result in severe explosion accident. In this paper, an finite element model is developed to analysis this progress. The transient heat flux density is derived from energy transformation progress in <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> action, and applied as boundary condition to the finite element model. Experiments are carried out to measure the temperature increase of <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> frictional surface, and the results show good coincidence of temperature increase tendency between experiments and simulations...|$|R

40|$|Safety {{behaviour}} {{consists of}} actions, thoughts, and/or protective objects that fearful individuals use {{to reduce their}} anxiety. It can potentially interfere with the progress of exposure therapy, which entails exposing patients to a feared stimulus or situation, but other hypotheses suggest {{that it may not}} be entirely detrimental to treatment effectiveness. This study aims to elucidate the role of safety behaviour in exposure-based treatments for anxiety disorders and uses a paradigm of exposure treatment for snake fear. Participants are randomized to one of two conditions, whereby they use either <b>safety</b> <b>gear,</b> such as gloves and goggles, or do not use any <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> during 45 minutes of systematic exposure to a live snake. Measures are administered pre-treatment, immediately following treatment, and 10 minutes post-treatment to assess participants' fear-related cognitions, subjective ratings of fear, and their distance of closest approach to the snake. The results demonstrate that exposure treatment for snake fear is effective irrespective of safety behaviour use, as indicated by pre- to post-treatment differences for both groups of participants on all outcome measures. It was found that participants who used <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> reported cognitive change equivalent to those who did not use <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> post-treatment, supporting the notion that use of safety behaviour during exposure treatment may promote adaptive cognitive change. Results are discussed in terms of cognitive-behavioural theories of and treatments for anxiety disorders...|$|R
