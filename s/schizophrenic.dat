5|$|Chapters on {{methodology}} {{comprise a}} third of the book's core. Identical and fraternal twins were classified using fingerprints and blood groups. Follow-up interviews were recorded to monitor the progress of their patients (the probands) and their twins, some <b>schizophrenic</b> and others not. Two psychological teststhe MMPI and the Object Sorting Test (Goldstein Scheerer Test of Concept Formation)were used to measure mental traits and functioning. Case summaries were prepared by the Scandinavian psychiatrist Erick Essen-Moller, and these were sent, with data on identical-or-fraternal-twin status and diagnosis-of-schizophrenia removed, to six judges from the U.S., U.K. and Japan. The judges independently evaluated whether the patients were <b>schizophrenic.</b>|$|E
5|$|He was {{particularly}} interested in dementia praecox (which he favored renaming schizophrenia), and found diffuse anatomic differences in the brains of <b>schizophrenic</b> patients. These changes were ignored or dismissed as artifactual by other investigators for several decades. Serious attention to Southard's findings did not reemerge in the medical literature until the 1990s, but changes in diagnostic criteria complicate the application of Southard's findings to modern <b>schizophrenic</b> patients. Shortly before his death Southard wrote and presented Non-dementia non-praecox: note on the advantages to mental hygiene of extirpating a term, but did not live to see it published.|$|E

40|$|Demographic and {{clinical}} characteristics of 275 <b>schizophrenics</b> consecutively admitted to seven hospitals were examined. Males were younger than females when first hospitalized, diagnosed and treated. Psychiatrists rated on two rating scales {{by using a}} structured interview to compare the symptomatology. Female <b>schizophrenics</b> were more agitated, inappropriate, silly, irrelevant, over-talkative, and exhibiting more flight of ideas, while male <b>schizophrenics</b> were more slowed, hypoactive, grandiose, withdrawn, and showing more blocking, auditory hallucinations and poor communica-tions. Katz Adjustment Scales were rated by the patients and their relatives. Female <b>schizophrenics</b> were perceived by relatives to be more helpless and withdrawn-depressed than male <b>schizophrenics...</b>|$|R

40|$|Differences between {{research}} {{diagnostic criteria}} (RDC) -diagnosed acute and chronic <b>schizophrenics</b> and normal controls were studied using a Kamin blocking procedure. Blocking is an established animal learning procedure, thought by some researchers to reflect selective attention; decreased blocking indicates increased processing of irrelevant stimuli. It was predicted that this pattern would be obtained in acute <b>schizophrenics,</b> tested soon after admission, for two reasons: (1) evidence from previous clinical studies indicates that acute <b>schizophrenics</b> are {{more aware of}} nonsalient aspects of their environment than controls; and (2) blocking is disrupted in animals in a hyperdopaminergic state and restored by neuroleptic medication. This was the case: acute, but not chronic, <b>schizophrenics</b> showed disrupted blocking. This disruption was especially clear in those acute <b>schizophrenics</b> tested within 2 weeks of hospital admission. By the second test session (in a cross-over design), there was some evidence of normalization in performance in the acute <b>schizophrenics.</b> These findings are considered {{with regard to the}} dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} cope with the {{psychological}} trauma of prostitution and violence, Falle became dependent on cocaine. Within two years, she was spending $500 per night on cocaine. Her drug use resulted in delusions and caused her to become <b>schizophrenic,</b> and subsequently distrustful of those around her, fearing that people were coming to take away her drugs.|$|E
5|$|As if {{struck by}} a blow, one {{suddenly}} recognizes the scientific futility, the biological senselessness, and the social noxiousness of views and institutions, which until that moment had seemed altogether natural and self-evident. It {{is a kind of}} eschatological experience so frequently encountered in a pathological form in schizophrenics. I might even voice the belief that the <b>schizophrenic</b> form of psychic illness is regularly accompanied by illuminating insight into the irrationalism of social and political mores.|$|E
40|$|Twenty-eight <b>schizophrenics,</b> 36 non-schizophrenic {{psychiatric}} {{patients and}} 29 normal controls {{were examined in}} the tasks of recall and recognition of visual information. <b>Schizophrenics</b> were poorer than normals both in recall and recognition. On the other hand, non-schizophrenics were as poor as <b>schizophrenics</b> in recall, but were comparable to normals in recognition. These results suggest that <b>schizophrenics</b> have deficit in input stage of memory process. The performances of visual short-term memory tasks had significant correlations with the IQ or the Pascal scores of Bender Gestalt Test, indicating that memory deficit in schizophrenia was derived from more primary disturbances of intelligence or cerebral function...|$|R
40|$|Plasma TP was {{determined}} fluorometrically in four group of males: (1) normal controls (2) chronic <b>schizophrenics</b> (3) acute <b>schizophrenics</b> and (4) prison volunteers with personality disorders {{with and without}} symptoms of depression. To control for circadian rhythm all subjects were fasted overnight or {{in the afternoon and}} evening prior to withdrawal of venous blood. Fasting a. m. or p. m. plasma TP was within the range of normal for all groups. However, the acute <b>schizophrenics</b> and prison volunteers had lower plasma TP than the normal controls and chronic <b>schizophrenics</b> (p<middot; 01. Plasma TP {{was determined}} before an 8 : 00 a. m. TP load and at, 1, 2, 4, and 7 hr after ingestion. A plasma tolerance curve was obtained with a peak at 1 - 2 hr which returned almost to normal at 7 hr. Various TP parameters were measured including fasting peak, maximal change in TP, time of peak, slope 2 - 4 and 4 - 7 hr, measured and normalized areas under the plasma tolerance curve, and plasma half-life. Almost {{no significant differences were found}} between normal controls and the chronic <b>schizophrenics.</b> Although all prison volunteers showed a markedly different TP tolerance curve from either the normal controls or chronic <b>schizophrenics,</b> depressed prisoners has a significantly lower and flatter curve. It appears that TP is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and its plasma half-life is normal in chronic <b>schizophrenics.</b> Further studies in acute <b>schizophrenics</b> and depressed patients are indicated...|$|R
40|$|Twenty four remitted <b>schizophrenics</b> {{and twenty}} four {{neurotic}} depressives were studied on three measures of visual information processing, viz., simple reaction time, choice reaction time, and a forced choice span of apprehension test. The groups were matched for age, sex, and educational status. The remitted <b>schizophrenics</b> performed poorly on these measures compared to neurotic depressives. The {{findings suggest that}} information processing deficits are present in outpatient <b>schizophrenics</b> even during clinical remission...|$|R
5|$|As the {{conflict}} raged, other Arab governments attempted {{to negotiate a}} peaceful resolution. As part of this effort, Gamal Abdel Nasser led the first emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on 21 September. Arafat's speech drew sympathy from attending Arab leaders. Other heads of state took sides against Hussein, among them Muammar Gaddafi, who mocked him and his <b>schizophrenic</b> father King Talal. A ceasefire was agreed upon between the two sides, but Nasser died of a massive heart attack hours after the summit, and {{the conflict}} resumed shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman {{has written}} and co-written {{a series of}} books which {{summarize}} his work. These publications include raw data from various studies, their statistical interpretation, and possible conclusions presented with necessary background material. The books also include first-hand accounts of <b>schizophrenic</b> patients and relatives tending to them, giving an insight into jumbled thoughts, the disorder's primary symptom. Gottesman and Shields have built models to explain the cause, transmission, and progression of the disorder, which is controlled by many genes acting {{in concert with the}} environment, with no cause sufficient by itself.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} the motel and finds Max inside his trailer, having an {{apparent}} epileptic seizure. As Mulder tends to Max, he discovers a mysterious scar behind Max's ear. Mulder reviews earlier X-Files, discovering similar scars on two reported alien abductees. Scully believes that whatever abduction experience Max had was a <b>schizophrenic</b> delusion, having noticed medication in his trailer. But Mulder believes that Max, despite his interest in UFOs, is completely unaware of his experiences and was guided to Townsend by his abductors {{on the night of}} the crash.|$|E
40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) and the deoxyglucose method {{were used to}} measure cerebral metabolism in 14 normals and 13 <b>schizophrenics</b> at rest and during performance of simple and complex finger-movement sequences. The normals, but not the <b>schizophrenics,</b> showed significant metabolic activation in mesial frontal and contralateral sensorimotor and premotor regions during the complex movement. The relative metabolism of <b>schizophrenics</b> was significantly lower than normal in frontal regions and higher than normal in thalamus and basal ganglia under all scanning conditions. The results suggest that <b>schizophrenics</b> may have a brain dysfunction which limits their capacity to produce a focal metabolic response to stimulation in several functionally distinct brain regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{identity}} disorders in <b>schizophrenics</b> and borderlines. Nineteen <b>schizophrenics</b> and 17 borderlines {{were compared with}} 18 normal controls. The technique used was an adapted version of the repertory grid test to describe the self and nine significant others (i. e., family members). Three indices were derived from the 10 person x 20 self-generated-attribute matrix to measure {{the extent to which}} self was differentiated from others: (1) overlap of salient attributes, (2) overlap of opposite attributes, and (3) degree of differentiation among others. Results showed that both <b>schizophrenics</b> and borderlines describe themselves more in terms of opposites than in terms of salient attributes. Differentiation among significant others was severely impaired in <b>schizophrenics</b> and preserved in borderlines. These findings were interpreted as a failure of the individuation process in <b>schizophrenics</b> and as an incomplete construal of self-identity in borderlines. (C) 1995 by W. B.

5|$|The album {{features}} a heavy use of electronics augmented by orchestration, and takes {{inspiration from the}} apocalyptic artwork of <b>schizophrenic</b> artist Royal Robertson. Stevens' use of electronics marked {{a radical departure from}} much of his previous work—most notably from Seven Swans and Michigan. Unlike Illinois, the lyrics do not explore events, characters or setting, but deal instead with themes and emotions on a personal level.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Ohio, Gottesman studied {{psychology}} for his {{undergraduate and graduate}} degrees, became {{a faculty member at}} various universities, and spent most of his career at the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota. He is known for researching schizophrenia in identical twins to document the contributions of genetics and the family, social, cultural, and economic environment to the onset, progress, and inter-generational transmission of the disorder. Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were <b>schizophrenic.</b> He has also researched the effects of genetics and the environment on human violence and variations in human intelligence. Gottesman and co-researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics—the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment {{from other parts of the}} genome—to the field of psychiatric genetics.|$|E
5|$|Asher Levi is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from , an Internet spin-off of the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Played by Heshima Thompson, Asher is a main character in series two.

As a father-figure to his younger brother Sol Levi (Tosin Cole), Asher occasionally resorts to stealing {{in order to provide}} for them both. He is willing to go to extreme lengths to protect Sol, including being stabbed by their <b>schizophrenic</b> mother. Over the course of the series, Asher betrays Sol by sleeping with his girlfriend, Naz Mehmet (Emaa Hussen). The two are ultimately able to reconcile, and Asher makes amends by encouraging his brother's dancing talent.|$|E
40|$|A {{battery of}} neuropsychological tasks {{was used to}} study 62 <b>schizophrenics,</b> 67 melancholics, and 30 manics {{satisfying}} specific research diagnostic criteria, and 42 normal subjects. Two patterns of neuropsychological impairment among patients were identified by factor analysis. The first pattern of bifrontal, non-dominant hemisphere dysfunction was shared by <b>schizophrenics</b> and affectively ill patients, whereas the second pattern of dominant temporo-parietal-occipital impairment was most frequent in a subgroup of <b>schizophrenics.</b> These relationships remained after accounting {{for the effects of}} age, gender, handedness and drugs received at time of testing...|$|R

5|$|Family {{studies on}} {{schizophrenia}} were reviewed. That the disorder runs in families did not suggest it was genetically inherited, since cultural transmission occurs from parents to children. Twin and adoption studies were presented {{as the standard}} methods to disentangle contributions from genes and the environment. Gottesman used a computer-based method for calculating the odds of becoming <b>schizophrenic</b> based on the many causes. The book examines the problems caused by schizophrenia for relatives of patients and for society at large, larger-scale ones exemplified by the eugenics policies of states such as Nazi Germany. Two final chapters cover molecular biology and neuroanatomy briefly. Newer methods of behavioral genetics being researched {{at the time of}} publication, such as linkage analysis which used the likelihood of neighboring genes being inherited together, were not covered.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman and Shields {{published}} Schizophrenia and Genetics {{to document}} their twin-study {{research at the}} Maudsley Hospital in London, the work that in part earned them the Hofheimer Prize for Research, the highest award for psychiatric research from the American Psychiatric Association. The study expanded on an earlier one by Eliot Slater at the same hospital, covering 24 identical and 33 fraternal twins, {{with at least one}} from every pair a <b>schizophrenic</b> being treated at the hospital between 1948 and 1964. This study was one of eleven such in the contemporary literature, and the book detailed the methodology and analytic detail differentiating it from the others.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that he felt like he had known her {{for a long time and}} concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a <b>schizophrenic</b> episode around this time.|$|E
40|$|This {{literature}} review examines {{the strength of}} the relationship between schizophrenia and violence, symptoms associated with violence in <b>schizophrenics,</b> and two drug treatments associated with treating violence in schizophrenia. In terms of the relationship between schizophrenia and violence, schizophrenia does not surpass other mental illnesses in its association with violence; however, just as other mental illnesses do, it surpasses the normal population in levels of violence. Two symptoms, hostility and suspiciousness, are common in violent <b>schizophrenics.</b> In contrast, antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy have not been clearly associated with violent <b>schizophrenics,</b> most likely due to methodological problems. Similarly, hallucinations, delusions, serotonin levels, and testosterone levels have not been clearly associated with violence in schizophrenia. In terms of drug treatments, the use of clozapine and risperidone {{have been found to be}} effective in treating violent <b>schizophrenics...</b>|$|R

5|$|In April 1930, Zelda was {{admitted}} to a sanatorium in France where, after months of observation and treatment and a consultation with one of Europe's leading psychiatrists, Doctor Eugen Bleuler, she was diagnosed as a <b>schizophrenic.</b> Initially admitted to a hospital outside Paris, she was later moved to a clinic in Montreux, Switzerland. The clinic primarily treated gastrointestinal ailments, and because of her profound psychological problems she was moved to a psychiatric facility, in Prangins {{on the shores of}} Lake Geneva. She was released in September 1931, and the Fitzgeralds returned to Montgomery, Alabama, where her father, Judge Sayre, was dying. Amid her family's bereavement, Scott announced that he was leaving for Hollywood. Zelda's father died while Scott was gone, and her health again deteriorated. By February 1932, she had returned to living in a psychiatric clinic.|$|E
5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared <b>schizophrenic</b> or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk.|$|E

Her father was an abusive {{alcoholic}} and was killed by Sidle's <b>schizophrenic</b> mother in 1984. Afterward, she spent time in the foster care system, which didn't keep her from graduating high school as valedictorian at age 16. She attended Harvard on a scholarship, moving on to graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley. While at Berkeley, she started a work-study position at the San Francisco Coroner's Office, where she would also audit lectures to keep up with new developments; it was at one of these that she met Gil Grissom.|$|E
