50|$|In {{addition}} to the stem clamp area, the shifter and/or brake lever and grip area on a bar can have several different diameters. For traditional road and mountain handlebars, these diameters are standard and so there has historically been little confusion except when mixing road and mountain components. However, in recent years there have been cross-over bar types that do not fall into one category or the other, and which can conceivably use either type of shifter, brake lever or grip (an example is the upright <b>style</b> <b>bar).</b> For this reason, certain handlebars are now available in multiple sizes related to the shifter or brake lever clamp diameter.|$|E
5000|$|For {{many years}} Alcuin College {{was very much}} the outcast on the {{university}} campus, the only college physically separate from the others except for a bridge from the library, a narrow bridge from Langwith (demolished over Easter 2008) and a walkway to the chemistry department. Overlooking University Road was Alcuin's bar. In 1995 this was transformed from a traditional British pub <b>style</b> <b>bar</b> to a 1950s American theme bar - the only themed college bar on campus. The bar was decorated in American 1950s paraphanelia such as busts of Marilyn Monroe and a full-size pink cadillac {{that appeared to be}} crashing through the wall. The bar's terrace overlooked University Road and was immensely popular with students in the summer. The bar incorporated a burger bar and the staff all wore uniforms of stars and stripes. In the new century, the bar was renamed B Henry's, after Brian Henry, a college porter of many years who had recently retired, and on opening was immensely popular despite its relatively distant location compared to the rest of campus. In 2007 the bar once again went under transformation, being revamped as a [...] "B Henry's. The Cocktail Bar". In 2008, a move by commercial services to close B Henry's triggered a large campaign to save the bar. This campaign had the backing of the whole college and the students union as a whole, but it was unsuccessful. [...] In 2013, the Student Union took over the running of the outlet and named it The Kitchen at Alcuin.|$|E
