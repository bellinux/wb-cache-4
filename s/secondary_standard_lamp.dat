40|$|This report {{presents}} {{results of}} the third Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Intercalibration Round- Robin Experiment (SIRREX- 3), which {{was held at the}} San Diego State University (SDSU) Center for Hydro-Optics and Remote Sensing (CHORS) on 19 - 30 September 1994. Spectral irradiances of FEL lamps belonging to each participant were intercompared by reference to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) scale of spectral irradiance using secondary standard lamps F 268, F 269, and F 182, with a Type A uncertainty between 1. 1 - 1. 5 %. This level of uncertainty was achieved despite difficulties with lamp F 269. The average spectral irradiances of FEL lamps, compared in both SIRREX- 2 and SIRREX- 3, differed between the two experiments by 1. 5 %, which probably indicates that the values assigned to the <b>secondary</b> <b>standard</b> <b>lamp</b> at the time of SIRREX- 2 were in error. With two exceptions, spectral radiance values of integrating sphere sources were measured during SIRREX- 3 with uncertainties in temporal stability of less than 0. 3 % and absolute uncertainties of 1. 5 - 2. 0 %. This is a significant improvement over similar intercomparisons in SIRREX- I and SIRREX- 2. Plaque reflectances were intercompared with an uncertainty of about 1 - 2 %, but the absolute uncertainty is undefined. Although this is an improvement over results of previous SIRREXS, the sources and magnitude of uncertainty associated with transfers of spectral radiance using plaques requires further evaluation in future experiments...|$|E

A spectrometer and optical system are calibrated using a standard tungsten filament (blackbody) lamp whose intensity calibration is traceable to the National Bureau of Standards. Knowing the number of photons emitted by the lamp, we determine a wavelength dependent system efficiency. By careful comparison of the intensity of spectral lines emitted from the beam-foil source to an appropriate portion of the continuous spectrum emitted from the <b>standard</b> blackbody <b>lamp,</b> the beam-foil source is calibrated over the same region of the spectrum as is the <b>standard</b> <b>lamp.</b> Branching ratios are then used to extend this calibration into the vacuum ultraviolet...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the calibration transfer path from primary standards representing fundamental physical quantities through the calibration radiance source used in Hyperion instrument level absolute calibration. The calibration transfer path and hardware {{design of the}} primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>standards</b> and their validation for end-to-end calibration of the sensor are presented. The primary standards reside at the TRW Radiometric Scale Facility and include two high quantum efficiency Silicon photodiode trap detectors; an electrically self-calibrated pyroelectric detector serves as a <b>secondary</b> <b>standard</b> for cross-check. The end-to-end sensor calibration is accomplished with a Spectralon Panel Assembly source, that is illuminated by a NIST traceable FEL 1000 watt transfer <b>standard</b> <b>lamp.</b> An independent cross-check of the Spectralon reflectance properties is made with a transfer radiometer. An error analysis of the transfer path is presented. The basic strategy of the Hyperion end-to-end calibration {{is to reduce the}} length of the sensor responsivity error tree and to provide control of systematic errors as much as possible through cross-calibration. 1...|$|R

40|$|The two Brewer spectrophotometers of the Finnish Meteorological Institute at Jokioinen and Sodankyla {{have been}} {{operated}} {{according to the}} highest levels of the WMO/GAW (World Meteorological Organization/Global Atmosphere Watch) recommendations with rigorous quality control and quality assurance. The calibration of the instruments is based on annual recalibrations of primary <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> in the VTT MIKES Metrology National Standards Laboratory in Finland and an exhaustive measurement program with measurements of <b>standard</b> and working <b>lamps</b> in the on-site optical laboratories. Over the years, the maintenance of the calibration has produced data sets of approximately 2000 lamp scans for both instruments. An extensive re-examination of the lamp measurements and the response of the spectrophotometers was carried out. The primary <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> were found to age on an average rate of 0. 3 % per burn. The responsivity at wavelength 311 nm was found to exhibit both long-term and short-term changes. The overall long-term change was declining. In addition, abrupt changes of as large as 25 % were detected. The short-term changes were found to fluctuate on time frames shorter than the interval between the measurements of the primary <b>standard</b> <b>lamps.</b> This underlines the importance of the use of more frequently measured working <b>standard</b> <b>lamps...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{absolute}} calibration of remote sensing systems {{is based upon}} radiometric standards. The irradiance standards are currently 1000 -watt quartz tungsten-halogen lamps that are traced to National Institute of Standards and Technology standards by a middle party at a significant cost. Lamp instability, short lifetime and calibration inaccuracy present problems. A detector-based {{absolute calibration}} technique is described here to replace the lamp calibration in the visible portion of the spectrum (approximately 400 to 700 nm). The system utilizes a quantum efficient QED- 200 trap detector in an automated facility to absolutely characterize lamp spectral irradiances or reflectance panel spectral radiances. The measured irradiance of a directly-viewed <b>standard</b> <b>lamp</b> compared favorably (within 0. 8 %) to the original calibration. Standard-reflectance-panel radiance measurements could not be accurately compared (within 5 %) to the illuminating <b>standard</b> <b>lamp</b> irradiance because of excessive stray light in the calibration facility...|$|R
