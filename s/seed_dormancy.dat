25|$|Some live {{seeds are}} dormant and need more time, and/or {{need to be}} {{subjected}} to specific environmental conditions before they will germinate. <b>Seed</b> <b>dormancy</b> can originate {{in different parts of the}} seed, for example, within the embryo; in other cases the seed coat is involved. Dormancy breaking often involves changes in membranes, initiated by dormancy-breaking signals. This generally occurs only within hydrated seeds. Factors affecting <b>seed</b> <b>dormancy</b> include the presence of certain plant hormones, notably abscisic acid, which inhibits germination, and gibberellin, which ends <b>seed</b> <b>dormancy.</b> In brewing, barley seeds are treated with gibberellin to ensure uniform seed germination for the production of barley malt.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} strategies are used by gardeners and horticulturists to break <b>seed</b> <b>dormancy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Often, <b>seed</b> <b>dormancy</b> {{is divided}} into four major categories: exogenous; endogenous; combinational; and secondary. A more recent system distinguishes five classes: morphological, physiological, morphophysiological, {{physical}} and combinational dormancy.|$|E

50|$|Gibberellins are {{produced}} in greater mass when {{the plant is}} exposed to cold temperatures. They stimulate cell elongation, breaking and budding, seedless fruits, and seed germination. They do the last by breaking the <b>seed’s</b> <b>dormancy</b> and acting as a chemical messenger. Its hormone binds to a receptor, and Ca2+ activates the protein calmodulin, and the complex binds to DNA, producing an enzyme to stimulate growth in the embryo.|$|R

25|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>dormancy</b> is not {{the same}} as seed {{persistence}} in the soil or on the plant, though even in scientific publications dormancy and persistence are often confused or used as synonyms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>dormancy</b> has {{two main}} functions: {{the first is}} {{synchronizing}} germination with the optimal conditions for survival of the resulting seedling; the second is spreading germination of a batch of seeds over time so a catastrophe (e.g. late frosts, drought, herbivory) does not result {{in the death of}} all offspring of a plant (bet-hedging). <b>Seed</b> <b>dormancy</b> is defined as a seed failing to germinate under environmental conditions optimal for germination, normally when the environment is at a suitable temperature with proper soil moisture. This true dormancy or innate dormancy is therefore caused by conditions within the seed that prevent germination. Thus dormancy is a state of the seed, not of the environment. Induced dormancy, enforced dormancy or seed quiescence occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are inappropriate for germination, mostly in response to conditions being too dark or light, too cold or hot, or too dry.|$|E
25|$|Before European {{settlement}} in Australia, Indigenous Australians managed the land using fire. Once Europeans colonised the area these fire practices {{began to decline}} and the effect it has had on the plant is unknown. While fire is not required for G. kennedyana to release its seed, {{it is believed that}} it is required for breaking <b>seed</b> <b>dormancy.</b> This needs to be properly investigated as the species does not occur in a fire prone zone.|$|E

40|$|Among {{the factors}} {{affecting}} germinability of a seed lot are the environmental {{conditions under which}} the seeds are produced.

25|$|The {{period of}} <b>seed</b> <b>dormancy</b> is another unknown factor which {{needs to be}} investigated. Depending on its {{similarity}} to other Grevillea species it is possibly that it can remain dormant for up to four years. Any recruitment that does occur via seed {{is believed to be}} event driven, relying on the combination of above average rainfall and the appropriate temperature. Seedlings that are becoming established in the summer months may be greatly affected by high temperatures and the absence of soil moisture.|$|E
25|$|This {{class of}} PGR is {{composed}} of one chemical compound normally produced in the leaves of plants, originating from chloroplasts, especially when plants are under stress. In general, it acts as an inhibitory chemical compound that affects bud growth, and seed and bud dormancy. It mediates changes within the apical meristem, causing bud dormancy and the alteration of the last set of leaves into protective bud covers. Since it was found in freshly abscissed leaves, it was thought {{to play a role}} in the processes of natural leaf drop, but further research has disproven this. In plant species from temperate parts of the world, it plays a role in leaf and <b>seed</b> <b>dormancy</b> by inhibiting growth, but, as it is dissipated from seeds or buds, growth begins. In other plants, as ABA levels decrease, growth then commences as gibberellin levels increase. Without ABA, buds and seeds would start to grow during warm periods in winter and be killed when it froze again. Since ABA dissipates slowly from the tissues and its effects take time to be offset by other plant hormones, there is a delay in physiological pathways that provide some protection from premature growth. It accumulates within seeds during fruit maturation, preventing seed germination within the fruit, or seed germination before winter. Abscisic acid's effects are degraded within plant tissues during cold temperatures or by its removal by water washing in out of the tissues, releasing the seeds and buds from dormancy.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} land plants {{evolved from}} aquatic plants around [...] (Ma) in the Ordovician period. Many plants {{have adapted to}} iodine-deficient terrestrial environment by removing iodine from their metabolism, in fact iodine is essential only for animal cells. An important antiparasitic action {{is caused by the}} block of the transport of iodide of animal cells inhibiting sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). Many plant pesticides are glycosides (as the cardiac digitoxin) and cyanogenic glycosides which liberate cyanide, which, blocking cytochrome c oxidase and NIS, is poisonous only for a large part of parasites and herbivores and not for the plant cells in which it seems useful in <b>seed</b> <b>dormancy</b> phase. Iodide is not pesticide, but is oxidized, by vegetable peroxidase, to iodine, which is a strong oxidant, it is able to kill bacteria, fungi and protozoa.|$|E

2500|$|During <b>seed</b> <b>dormancy,</b> often {{associated}} with unpredictable and stressful environments, DNA damages accumulate as the seeds age. [...] In rye seeds, the reduction of DNA integrity due to damage is associated with loss of seed viability during storage. [...] Upon germination, seeds of Vicia faba undergo DNA repair. [...] A plant DNA ligase that is involved in repair of single- and double-strand breaks during seed germination is an important determinant of seed longevity. [...] Also, in Arabidopsis seeds, {{the activities of the}} DNA repair enzymes Poly ADP ribose polymerases (PARP) are likely needed for successful germination. [...] Thus DNA damages that accumulate during dormancy appear to be a problem for seed survival, and the enzymatic repair of DNA damages during germination appears to be important for seed viability.|$|E
2500|$|Malting is {{the process}} of {{converting}} barley or other cereal grains into malt, for use in brewing, distilling, or in foods and takes place in a maltings, sometimes called a malthouse, or a malting floor. The cereal is spread out on the malting floor in a layer of 8 to 12cm (3 to 5 inch) depth. The malting process starts with drying the grains to a moisture content below 14%, and then storing for around six weeks to overcome <b>seed</b> <b>dormancy.</b> When ready, the grain is immersed or steeped in water two or three times over two or three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to start to sprout. When the grain has a moisture content of around 46%, it is transferred to the malting or germination floor, where it is constantly turned over for around five days while it is air-dried [...] The grain at this point is called [...] "green malt". The green malt is then dried and pre-toasted in an oven (or kiln) to the desired colour and specification. Malts range in colour from very pale through crystal and amber to chocolate or black malts.|$|E
