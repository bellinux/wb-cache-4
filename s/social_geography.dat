Allegedly {{inspired by the}} similar interests of Élisée Reclus, Dicționar geografic al Basarabiei was the first-ever actual Bessarabian gazetteer. In his two works on Bessarabia, Arbore sought to present {{a detailed account of}} economic and <b>social</b> <b>geography.</b> He notably inventoried the villages originally settled by free peasants (răzeși), accounting for 151 such localities in central Bessarabia and 4 in the Budjak.|$|E

40|$|This review {{discusses}} the <b>social</b> <b>geographies</b> of food, focusing on how social geographic {{research has been}} taken up in and influenced by the wider discussions of food geographies in the discipline. It does so with particular attention to: the spatial politics of food deserts, food security, and food justice movements; the socialities of food identities; and the embodiments of food. This tripartite discussion of the <b>social</b> <b>geographies</b> of food is intended to highlight the complex theoretical and methodological approaches that geographers are employing when interrogating this particular object...|$|R

2500|$|The subversive {{activities}} brought Zamfir to {{the attention}} of Tsarist authorities, particularly after his involvement in Sergey Nechayev's nihilist conspiracy of 1869. Unable to finish his studies, Arbore was singled out for arrest, and according to his own account, since placed under doubt, even served time as a political prisoner in the Peter and Paul Fortress and in Siberia. Eventually, {{he made his way to}} Switzerland, where he contacted international anarchist figures such as Mikhail Bakunin and Élisée Reclus. Arbore corresponded with the latter for a significant period, sharing his interest in <b>social</b> <b>geography.</b> His complex relationship with radical exiles also resulted in contacts with anarcho-communist theorist Peter Kropotkin and the Bulgarian anarchist sympathizer Hristo Botev. He was also, with philosopher Vasile Conta, one of the few intellectuals with a Romanian background to affiliate directly with the International Workingmen's Association (First International), which regrouped the various Marxist and anarchist communities of Europe. In tandem, Arbore was active within Bakunin's Revolutionary Brotherhood, and, according to anarchist historian George Woodcock, one of the [...] "most influential" [...] among the Russian propagators of Bakuninism; political historian James H. Billington also refers to [...] "Zemfiry Ralli" [...] as [...] "Bakunin's principal editor".|$|E
60|$|There {{is no need}} {{to follow}} the details of St. Severinus's labours through some five-and-twenty years of {{perpetual}} self-sacrifice--and, as far as this world was concerned, perpetual disaster. Eugippius's chapters are little save a catalogue of towns sacked one after the other, from Passau to Vienna, till the miserable survivors of the war seemed to have concentrated themselves under St. Severinus's guardianship in the latter city. We find, too, tales of famine, of locust-swarms, of little victories over the barbarians, which do not arrest wholesale defeat: but we find through all St. Severinus labouring like a true man of God, conciliating the invading chiefs, redeeming captives, procuring for the cities which were still standing supplies of clothes for the fugitives, persuading the husbandmen, seemingly through large districts, to give even in time of dearth a tithe of their produce to the poor;--a tale of noble work which one regrets to see defaced by silly little prodigies, more important seemingly {{in the eyes of the}} monk Eugippius than the great events which were passing round him. But this is a fault too common with monk chroniclers. The only historians of the early middle age, they have left us a miserably imperfect record of it, because they were looking always rather for the preternatural than for the natural. Many of the saints' lives, as they have come down to us, are mere catalogues of wonders which never happened, from among which the antiquary must pick, out of passing hints and obscure allusions, the really important facts of the time,--changes political and <b>social,</b> <b>geography,</b> physical history, the manners, speech, and look of nations now extinct, and even the characters and passions of the actors in the story. How much can be found among such a list of wonders, by an antiquary who has not merely learning but intellectual insight, is proved by the admirable notes which Dr. Reeves has appended to Adamnan's life of St. Columba: but one feels, while studying his work, that, had Adamnan thought more of facts and less of prodigies, he might have saved Dr. Reeves the greater part of his labour, and preserved to us a mass of knowledge now lost for ever.|$|E
