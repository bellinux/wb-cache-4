50|$|Linear {{friction}} welding (LFW) {{is similar to}} <b>spin</b> <b>welding</b> except that the moving chuck oscillates laterally instead of spinning. The speeds are much lower in general, which requires the pieces to be kept under pressure at all times. This also requires the parts {{to have a high}} shear strength. Linear {{friction welding}} requires more complex machinery than <b>spin</b> <b>welding,</b> but has the advantage that parts of any shape can be joined, as opposed to parts with a circular meeting point. Another advantage is that in many instances quality of joint is better than that obtained using rotating technique.|$|E
50|$|Orbital {{friction}} welding {{is similar to}} <b>spin</b> <b>welding,</b> but uses a more complex machine to produce an orbital motion in which the moving part rotates in a small circle, {{much smaller than the}} size of the joint as a whole.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spin</b> <b>welding</b> systems {{consist of}} two chucks for holding the {{materials}} to be welded, {{one of which}} is fixed and the other rotating. Before welding, one of the work pieces is attached to the rotating chuck along with a flywheel of a given weight. The piece is then spun up to a high rate of rotation to store the required energy in the flywheel. Once spinning at the proper speed, the motor is removed and the pieces forced together under pressure. The force is kept on the pieces after the spinning stops to allow the weld to [...] "set".|$|E

Accessory manifolds and piping were attached by welding. Manufacturing processes employed are described...|$|R
40|$|NASA {{invention}} disclosure, NASA Case No. MFS- 31413, entitled "System for Controlling the Stirring Pin of a Friction Stir Welding Apparatus", (Patent Pending) {{authored by}} Jeff Ding, Dr Peter Romine and Pete Oelgoetz, addresses the precision {{control of the}} friction stir welding process. The closed-loop control system automatically adjusts the <b>spinning</b> <b>welding</b> pin, real-time, to maintain a precise penetration ligament (i. e., distance between pin-tip and weld panel backside surface). A specific pin length can be maintained while welding constant thickness or tapered material thickness weld panels. The closed-loop control system provides operator data and information relative to the exact position of the welding pin inside the weld joint. This paper presents the closed-loop RPT control system that operates using the auto-feedback of force signals sensed by the tip and shoulder of the welding pin. Significance: The FSW process can be successfully used in a production environment only {{if there is a}} method or technique that informs the FSW operator the precise location of the welding pin inside the weld joint. This is essential for applications in aerospace, automotive, pressure vessel, commercial aircraft and other industries...|$|R

50|$|<b>Spin</b> <b>welding</b> is a {{friction}} welding technique used on thermoplastic materials, {{in which the}} parts to be welded are heated by friction. The heat may be generated by turning on a lathe, a drill press, or a milling machine, where one part {{is driven by the}} chuck, and the other is held stationary with the spinning part driven against it. This is continued until the heat of friction between the parts reaches a sufficient level for the parts to weld. The stationary part is then released to spin as well, while pressure is applied along the axis of rotation, holding the parts together as they cool.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spin</b> <b>welding</b> is a {{particular}} form of frictional welding. With this process, one component with a round weld joint is held stationary, while a mating component is rotated at high speed and pressed against the stationary component. The rotational friction between the two components generates heat. Once the joining surfaces reach a semi-molten state, the spinning component is stopped abruptly. Force on the two components is maintained until the weld joint cools and re-solidifies. This is a common way of producing low- and medium-duty plastic wheels, e.g., for toys, shopping carts, recycling bins, etc. This process {{is also used to}} weld various port openings into automotive under hood components.|$|E
40|$|The Taguchi Method {{was applied}} {{in this study}} to discuss the {{mechanical}} strength of heterogeneous plastic materials by ultrasonic-aided <b>spin</b> <b>welding.</b> Two heterogeneous plastic workpieces were rotated by a high speed motor, to make the top of conducting energy angle generate the high temperature due to friction. When the thermoplastic material reached the heat distortion temperature, a proper pressure was exerted on another material, the surface would be welded in a semi-melted state. Then the process conditions of ultrasonic welding were arranged by using the standard orthogonal table of Taguchi Method, and {{the temperature of the}} contact friction surface could be increased by the excitation of ultrasonic transducers as well as magnified and displaced by sound wave welding head. The optimal value of tensile strength was obtained by using the Large-the-Best characteristic of the Taguchi Method to obtain the important control factors of this experiment; a validation experiment was carried out by using the adjusted factors. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{incremental}} {{forming process}} of “friction-spinning ” is {{suited to the}} manufacture of functionally graded workpieces made from tubes and sheets with the defined adjustment of material properties. The innovative feature of this new process {{is the use of}} process elements from both metal <b>spinning</b> and friction <b>welding.</b> As the workpieces are being processed, friction sub-processes are employed to achieve self-induced heat generation. Compared with conventional spinning processes, this in-process heat treatment permits the extension of existing forming limits and allows more complex geometries to be achieved, together with defined, favorable part properties. These properties, like strength, grain size or surface conditions, can be influenced by the set of specific temperature profiles that prevail during the manufacturing process in combination with the degree of deformation. The temperature profiles can be adjusted by selecting appropriate process and tool parameters in a defined manner. This paper presents the influence of the aforementioned parameters on the surface texture. The results presented start with the analysis of the surface texture development. Following this, the effects of the significant process parameters and tool geometries that give rise to the typical structure and hardness are explained...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFriction-spinning is an {{innovative}} incremental forming process that permits the defined adjustment of material properties {{in a particularly}} precise manner. The process is characterised {{by the use of}} process elements from both metal <b>spinning</b> and friction <b>welding.</b> As the workpieces are being processed, friction sub-processes are employed to achieve self-induced heat generation. Compared with conventional spinning processes, this in-process heat treatment permits the extension of existing forming limits and allows more complex geometries to be achieved, together with defined, favourable part properties. The process thus holds a high potential for the manufacture of functionally graded workpieces, such as complex hollow parts made from tubes and sheets. In order to achieve functional gradation, i. e. to influence the material properties (strength or grain size) in a defined manner, it is essential to be able to set specific temperature profiles. It would be possible to influence these profiles by selecting appropriate process parameters like the feed rate, relative motion and the coefficient of friction. The process characteristics of friction-spinning make it eminently suited to tube processing. A further approach to the manufacture of parts with functionally graded areas is the use of sheet metal blanks as another semi-finished product. The paper will present the corresponding results of basic research into the manufacture of sheet metal parts with the aid of friction-spinning. Here, the influence of significant process parameters, forming strategies and tool systems on both the course and the outcome of the friction-spinning process will be shown. In addition, the differences and correlations that exist between tube and sheet processing will be described and discussed on the basis of parts made of tubes and sheets. These parts are manufactured by the friction-spinning process employing different process strategies and tool setups...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 This thesis {{presents}} {{a model of}} self-correcting quantum memories where quantum states are encoded using topological stabilizer codes and error correction is done using local measurements and local dynamics. Quantum noise poses a practical barrier to developing quantum memories. This thesis explores two types of models for suppressing noise. One model suppresses thermalizing noise energetically by engineering a Hamiltonian with a high energy barrier between code states. Thermalizing dynamics are modeled phenomenologically as a Markovian quantum master equation with only local generators. The second model suppresses stochastic noise with a cellular automaton that performs error correction using syndrome measurements and a local update rule. Several ways of visualizing and thinking about stabilizer codes are presented in order to design ones that have a high energy barrier: the non-local Ising model, the quasi-particle graph and the theory of welded stabilizer codes. I develop the theory of welded stabilizer codes {{and use it to}} construct a code with the highest known energy barrier in 3 -d for <b>spin</b> Hamiltonians: the <b>welded</b> solid code. Although the welded solid code is not fully self correcting, it has some self correcting properties. It has an increased memory lifetime for an increased system size up to a temperature dependent maximum. One strategy for increasing the energy barrier is by mediating an interaction with an external system. I prove a no-go theorem for a class of Hamiltonians where the interaction terms are local, of bounded strength and commute with the stabilizer group. Under these conditions the energy barrier can only be increased by a multiplicative constant. I develop cellular automaton to do error correction on a state encoded using the toric code. The numerical evidence indicates that while there is no threshold, the model can extend the memory lifetime significantly. While of less theoretical importance, this could be practical for real implementations of quantum memories. Numerical evidence also suggests that the cellular automaton could function as a decoder with a soft threshold...|$|R
40|$|The {{so-called}} micromosaico (minute mosaic) is {{a singular}} form of urban representation, that has comtributed, {{since the end}} of XVIII century to spread throughout Europe, by production of jewelry and precious articles, the image of monuments and cities of Italy such as destinations of the Grand Tour. This technique obtained the citizenship in Vatican by the establishment in 1587 of the mosaic school of the Reverenda Fabbrica di San Pietro, with the task of decorating the interior of the basilica and replaying in a non-perishable form the pictorial heritage. The objective of imitating painting had requested a specific technical research, aimed at obtaining an almost infinite chromatic range of enamels, able to simulate the results of chromatic modulation obtained by brush. Despite this great technical skill, at the end of XVIII century the completion of the works of reproduction threatened to leave unemployed the mosaicists of the school, transformed by institution of the Studio del Mosaico Vaticano. It happened, however, that two of the most skilled and renowned of them, Cesare Aguatti and Giacomo Raffaelli, devised the so-called technique of "spun enamel", consisting in spinning of the vitreous enamel surface of the mosaic tiles, so as to obtain thin bars (1 millimeter in cross section). These could be segmented into tiles to compose tiny mosaics for inserting in wide range of items to serve as Italienreise souvenir: furnishings, such as coffee tables or fireplace coatings, or much smaller articles, such as snuff-boxes or jewelry. The ichonografic themes, which initially consisted mainly of classical antiquities, have gradually expanded to include depictions of the most popular urban places of Rome and then, since XIX century, even of other cities - Milan, Naples, Venice – where, in the Napoleon’s Era, they tried to export the know-how of the Roman Studio and, in parallel, developing their chromatic experimentation. The beginning phase of the micromosaic, coinciding with the last quarter of XVIII century, is dominated by the Giacomo Raffaelli’s personality, whose palette already included 872 different shades from 18 basic colors, among which predominates quantitatively the flesh-colored (over 800 bars) and the green color, with 77 different shades. The second phase, has been caracterized by the Antonio Aguatti’s invention of the so-called malmischiato, gradient tiles obtained by spinning of bars in variegated colors, that brings the art of micromosaic to its full maturity. The third phase started from the Michelangelo Barberi’s invention of the colori a soffio (colours by blowing), obtained by using in the <b>spinning</b> a <b>weld</b> lamp used by goldsmiths. These bars show colours with a particular vividness and a chromatic spectrum much broader than that obtained in furnace. So, if throug time the production of engravings and urban views has provided to mosacists a rich iconographic base for inspiration, we must not believe that this has been a mere work of reproduction or virtuosity of craftsmanship, because the transition from the incision in black and white to the composition mosaic, introduces the color - which, in the extremely small size of the final image, is fully in charge of the perspective composition - an absolutely original factor, wich can now boast a range of 28, 000 different color variations, the so-called munizioni (ammunitions) still in the possession of the Studio del Mosaico Vaticano...|$|R
