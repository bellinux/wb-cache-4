The deposition behavior was instead dominated by drying rate; too rapid of a drying rate led to excessive clogging of the tip. Slurry rheology had a greater impact on the shape of beads deposited using the Robocaster. Highly viscous slurries yielded initially well-defined beads, whereas beads deposited using fluid <b>slurries</b> <b>spread</b> quickly. In both cases, significant spreading occurred with time.

The effect of traffic on the grass crop was determined by measuring dry matter yield at 30 and 60 days posttraffic in the wheel-rut and nontrafficked area. Results showed that the SMD at the time of traffic had a significant (P < 0. 05) effect on the magnitude of the changes in SBD on soils of different drainage status, and on rut dimensions following traffic. DMY was significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced on the wheeled compared with the nonwheeled soil.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 570 on 15. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) Emissions of ammonia (NH 3) into the atmosphere, principally from agricultural sources, have {{been implicated in}} the pollution of forests, moorlands and grasslands, through the subsequent deposition of reduced nitrogen (NHx -N). Consequently, legislation has been implemented to control both the transboundary transport and local environmental impacts of NHx. This thesis investigates the emission, dispersion and local deposition of NH 3 from two sources that are major components of national NH 3 emissions inventories, slurry applied to grassland and naturally ventilated cattle buildings. A N balance method was identified for determining the time-average deposition of NH 3 downwind of a farm building, whilst an adapted micrometeorological flux-gradient technique was developed for estimating local deposition downwind of <b>slurry</b> <b>spreading.</b> This method used an analytical atmospheric dispersion model to provide advection corrections to the standard flux-gradient method. The UK-ADMS model, which incorporates a reasonably detailed treatment of building effects, was identified for use in determining the near-field dispersion from naturally ventilated farm buildings. Eight field experiments were conducted to determine the emission, dispersion and local deposition of NH 3 volatilised from slurry applications. Emission fluxes during the initial runs following <b>slurry</b> <b>spreading</b> were found to depend on friction velocity, relative humidity and rainfall. Local deposition, at sufficient rates to affect local deposition budgets, was not found to occur during near-freezing conditions or following the application of fertilisers. Local deposition velocities during other periods were found {{to depend on the}} latent heat flux, temperature and the roughness length. During such periods, 14 - 18 % of the emitted NH 3 was estimated to deposit within 50 m of the source. Experiments were also conducted at two naturally ventilated farm buildings, the Silsoe Research Institute Structures Building and a working dairy farm. Ammonia emission factors were determined for the main building and slurry lagoon at the dairy farm. A novel application of a model back-calculation method was applied to determine the emission from the lagoon. Dispersion of NH 3 from both sites was found to be adequately modelled using UK-ADMS. Approximately 2 % of the emitted NH 3 deposited within 100 - 150 m of each building. Time averaged deposition velocities calculated from the farm building studies confirmed that NH 3 was deposited to the leaf surfaces and uptaken across the leaf cuticle. Temperature dependent exchange rates were also indicated by the results of the farm building experiments, with NH 3 uptake being regulated by the assimilation potential of the plant. The experimental results demonstrated that deposition around both sources could lead to local critical load exceedances. These were only estimated to occur within a few tens of metres downwind of <b>slurry</b> <b>spreading</b> whilst critical load exceedances were predicted at distances of up to 100 m or more downwind of the farm building. The temporal variability in local recapture found in these experiments, particularly for farm buildings, suggests that seasonal variability in the treatment of NH 3 emission and deposition should be included in atmospheric transport models. Furthermore, it is possible that transboundary transport of NHx may increase during winter periods with peak housing emissions. The Institute of Grassland and Environmental Researc...|$|E

Low-emission techniques entailing injection and trailing shoes have therefore become compulsory in the Netherlands on grassland. There {{is an argument}} that the emission of ammonia after surface application is overestimated and that the emission of various other nitrogen (N) compounds, following the prescribed low-emission techniques, is underestimated. Opponents also claim that injection in particular decreases grassland yields due to its negative effect on soil quality and biodiversity. They state that a similar reduction in ammonia emissions could be realized via low-protein dairy cow diets and <b>slurry</b> <b>spreading</b> under favourable weather conditions.

40|$|The {{excessive}} {{amount of}} pig <b>slurry</b> <b>spread</b> on soil {{has contributed to}} nitrate water pollution both in surface and in ground waters, especially in areas classified as vulnerable zones to nitrate in accordance with European Regulation (91 / 676 /CEE). Several techniques {{have been developed to}} manage livestock slurries as cheaply and conveniently as possible and to reduce potential risks of environmental pollution. Among these techniques, solid-liquid separation of slurry is a common practice in Italy. The liquid fraction can be used for irrigation and the solid fraction, after aerobic stabilization, produces an organic compost rich in humic substances. However, compost derived from swine solid fraction is a low density material (bulk density less than 500 kgm– 3). This makes it costly to transport composted swine solid fraction from production sites to areas where it could be effectively utilized for value-added applications such as in soil fertilization. Densification is one possible way to enhance the storage and transportation of the compost. This study therefore investigates the effect of pressure (20 - 110 MPa) and pressure application time (5 - 120 s) on the compaction characteristics of compost derived from swine solid fraction. Two different types of material have been used: composted swine solid fraction derived from mechanical separation and compost obtained by mixing the first material with wood chips. Results obtained showed that both the pressure applied and the pressure application time significantly affect the density of the compacted samples; while the specific compression energy is significantly affected only by the pressure. Best predictor equations were developed to predict compact density and the specific compression energy required by the densification process. The specific compression energy values based on the results from this study (6 - 32 kJkg– 1) were significantly lower than the specific energy required to manufacture pellets from biomass feedstock (typically 19 - 90 kJkg– 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Mycobacterium bovis infection in cattle is increasing rapidly in some countries, including the UK and Ireland. The organism infects {{a wide range}} of mammalian hosts, and eradication of the disease is difficult if there is an extensive reservoir ill the wildlife population. Existing evidence suggests that wildlife vectors include the European badger in the UK and Ireland, the brush-tailed possum and ferret in New Zealand and ungulates in some other countries. Cattle grazing field boundaries or short swards are at particularly high risk, since the chance of contact with the intermediate host or their excreta is increased. There is evidence that the transmission of the disease between cattle following movement accounts for 10 - 15 % of outbreaks in the British Isles and that transmission can occur across farm boundaries. The {{prevalence of}} single reactors in herds suggested that within-herd transmission was not common. In herds with infected cattle, <b>spreading</b> <b>slurry</b> is a risk factor, which can be minimised by prolonged storage of the <b>slurry,</b> by <b>spreading</b> it on fields not used for grazing or by soil injection. M. bovis also survives in water and may enter the respiratory tract during drinking.

40|$|Losses of {{phosphorus}} (P) from {{soil and}} slurry during episodic rainfall events {{can contribute to}} eutrophication of surface water. However, chemical amendments {{have the potential to}} decrease P and suspended solids (SS) losses from land application of slurry. Current legislation attempts to avoid losses to a water body by prohibiting <b>slurry</b> <b>spreading</b> when heavy rainfall is forecast within 48 h. Therefore, in some climatic regions, <b>slurry</b> <b>spreading</b> opportunities may be limited. The current study examined the impact of three time intervals (TIs; 12, 24 and 48 h) between pig slurry application and simulated rainfall with an intensity of 11. 0 ± 0. 59 mm h- 1. Intact grassed soil samples, 1 m long, 0. 225 m wide and 0. 05 m deep, were placed in runoff boxes and pig slurry or amended pig slurry was applied to the soil surface. The amendments examined were: (1) commercial-grade liquid alum (8 % Al 2 O 3) applied at a rate of 0. 88 : 1 [Al/total phosphorus (TP) ] (2) commercial-grade liquid ferric chloride (38 % FeCl 3) applied at a rate of 0. 89 : 1 [Fe/TP] and (3) commercial-grade liquid poly-aluminium chloride (10 % Al 2 O 3) applied at a rate of 0. 72 : 1 [Al/TP]. Results showed that an increased TI between slurry application and rainfall led to decreased P and SS losses in runoff, confirming that the prohibition of land-spreading slurry if heavy rain is forecast in the next 48 h is justified. Averaged over the three TIs, the addition of amendment reduced all types of P losses to concentrations significantly different (p< 0. 05) to those from unamended slurry, with no significant difference between treatments. Losses from amended slurry with a TI of 12 h were less than from unamended slurry with a TI of 48 h, indicating that chemical amendment of slurry may be more effective at ameliorating P loss in runoff than current TI-based legislation. Due to the high cost of amendments, their incorporation into existing management practices can only be justified on a targeted basis where inherent soil characteristics deem their usage suitable to receive amended slurry. peer-reviewedIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (IRCSET) - EMBARK Scholarshi...|$|E

Then, the <b>slurry</b> was <b>spread</b> onto a 1  ×  4  cm FTO glass by the doctor blade technique and then allowed to dry in air. A 300  W xenon arc lamp served as a simulated solar light irradiation source (Perfectlight, PLS-SXE 300 C, Beijing, China). The incident light intensity was tuned to be 100  mW/cm 2 measured by NOVA Oriel 70260 with a thermodetector.|$|R

30|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{performance of}} the S/GNS composite cathode was investigated in coin-type cells (CR 2032) with PVDF-HFP/PMMA/SiO 2 GPE. The cell was composed of a lithium metal anode and the S/GNS composite cathode separated by the GPE film. The cathode is comprised of 80  wt% S/GNS composite, 10  wt% acetylene black (AB; 99.5 % purity, MTI, Richmond, CA, USA) as a conductive agent, and 10  wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF; 99.5 % purity, MTI) as a binder. These materials were dispersed in 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (NMP; ≥ 99 % purity, Sigma-Aldrich). The resultant <b>slurry</b> was <b>spread</b> onto aluminum foil using a doctor blade and dried at 50 °C for 12  h. The resulting cathode film was used to prepare the cathodes by punching circular disks of 1  cm in diameter. The coin cells were assembled in high-purity argon (99.9995 %) atmosphere. The cells were tested galvanostatically on multi-channel battery tester (BT- 2000, Arbin Instruments, College Station, TX, USA) between 1 and 3  V vs. Li+/Li. The applied currents and specific capacities were calculated {{on the basis of}} the weight of S in the cathode.|$|R
40|$|Zinc {{occurs in}} high {{quantity}} in pig slurry {{since it is}} used as an essential micronutrient at high concentrations in animal feeds despite the low Zn assimilation by pigs. Zinc accumulation was measured in soil surface layers that had been amended with pig slurry, while also determining the phytotoxicity {{as well as the}} extent of groundwater quality degradation. To accurately predict the mobility and bioavailability of Zn derived from pig <b>slurry</b> <b>spreading,</b> the speciation of this element has to be assessed since the total concentration is not sufficient. This study involved a combination of techniques to investigate Zn speciation in pig slurry. Size fractionation was first performed to account for the complexity of pig slurry, and 75 % of total Zn was detected in the 0. 45 - to 20 -µm particle-size range. Then X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, coupled with energy dispersive spectrometer, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analyses were combined to assess Zn speciation. The findings highlighted the presence of 49 % Zn bound to organic matter, 37 % amorphous Zn hydroxides [Zn(OH) 2], and 14 % sphalerite (ZnS). (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is now {{well-known}} that copper (Cu) can accumulate on {{the surface}} of soils upon which pig slurry has been applied. This is due to the high quantity of Cu in pig slurry resulting from its use as a growth promoter in animal feeds. The mobility and bioavailability of Cu from pig <b>slurry</b> <b>spreading</b> can be better predicted by determining the speciation of this element in addition to its total concentration. The aim {{of this study was to}} present a multitechnique approach to investigate Cu speciation in pig slurry. First, size fractionation and chemical characterization of each size fraction were performed to complement results obtained in raw samples. Micro X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (mu XRF) highlighted the colocalization of Cu and sulfur (S). Finally, X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) showed that Cu speciation in raw pig slurry and size fractions could be described by Cu(2) S and that its oxidation state is Cu(I). In addition, geochemical calculation demonstrated that chalcocite (Cu(2) S) was the major Cu species present under pig slurry lagoon physical-chemical conditions. This Cu speciation in pig slurry may be the main reason for the observed Cu accumulation at the soil surface...|$|E
40|$|The {{microbial}} community of a pig slurry {{on a farm}} was monitored for 6 months using both molecular and cultural approaches. Sampling was carried out at all the different stages of effluent handling, from the rearing build-up to <b>slurry</b> <b>spreading.</b> Total DNA of each sample was extracted and analyzed by PCR–single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis using primers targeting the 16 S rRNA genes from the archaeal and bacterial domains and also the Eubacterium-Clostridium, Bacillus-Streptococcus-Lactobacillus, and Bacte-roides-Prevotella groups. A comparison of the SSCP profiles showed that there were rapid changes in the dominant bacterial community during the first 2 weeks of anaerobic storage and that the community was relatively stable thereafter. Several bacterial populations, identified as populations closely related to uncul-tured Clostridium and Porphyromonas and to Lactobacillus and Streptococcus cultured species commonly isolated from pig feces, remained present and dominant from the rearing build-up {{to the time of}} spreading. Enumer-ation of fecal indicators (enterococci and Escherichia coli) performed in parallel using cultural methods revealed the same trends. On the other hand, the archaeal community adapted slowly during pig slurry storage, and its diversity increased. A shift between two hydrogenotrophic methanogenic Methanobrevibacter popula...|$|E
30|$|Working {{electrode}} was fabricated as follows: First, porous Zn–Sn–O nanocubes (70  wt%), Super-P {{carbon black}} (15  wt%), and {{sodium carboxymethyl cellulose}} (CMC, 15 wt%) were mixed in water to form a slurry. Then, the <b>slurry</b> was <b>spread</b> onto a Cu foil by a doctor blade method, followed by drying in vacuum at 80  °C for 8  h. A lithium foil acted as both the counter electrode and reference electrode, and a microporous polypropylene membrane (Celgard 2500) was used as separator. Then, CR 2016 coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with moisture and oxygen contents below 1  ppm. The electrolyte was 1  M of LiPF 6 in the mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1 : 1  vol%). Charge–discharge cycles of cells were measured between 0.01 and 2.0  V versus Li+/Li using a battery test instrument (LAND CT 2001 A model, Wuhan Jinnuo Electronics, China) at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) {{was conducted on the}} workstation at a scan rate of 0.1  mV s− 1 in a potential range of 5  mV– 2.0  V (vs. Li/Li+).|$|R

One unit of a disk type open slot injector with a gauge wheel for cutting depth control was used for experiments to determine the soil-machine interactions. Cutting resistance of a disk increased with increasing cutting depth of the disk. Motion resistance of a gauge wheel decreased with increasing cutting depth of the disk. This is thought that vertical load acting on the wheel decrease with increasing cutting depth of the disk, and the reduced vertical load to the wheel transferred to the disk...|$|R
40|$|Journal articleLosses of {{phosphorus}} (P) when {{pig slurry}} applications to land {{are followed by}} a rainfall event or losses from soils with high P contents can contribute to eutrophication of receiving waters. The addition of amendments to pig <b>slurry</b> <b>spread</b> on high P Index soils may reduce P and suspended sediment (SS) losses. This hypothesis was tested at laboratory-scale using runoff boxes under simulated rainfall conditions. Intact grassed soil samples, 100 cm-long, 22. 5 cm-wide and 5 cm-deep, were placed in runoff boxes and pig slurry or amended pig slurry {{was applied to the}} soil surface. The amendments examined were: (1) commercial grade liquid alum (8 % Al 2 O 3) applied at a rate of 0. 88 : 1 [Al: total phosphorus (TP) ] (2) commercial-grade liquid ferric chloride (38 % FeCl 3) applied at a rate of 0. 89 : 1 [Fe:TP] and (3) commercial-grade liquid poly-aluminium chloride (PAC) (10 % Al 2 O 3) applied at a rate of 0. 72 : 1 [Al:TP]. The grassed soil was then subjected to three rainfall events (10. 3 Â± 0. 15 mm h- 1) at time intervals of 48, 72, and 96 h following slurry application. Each sod received rainfall on 3 occasions. Results across three rainfall events showed that for the control treatment, the average flow weighted mean concentration (FWMC) of TP was 0. 61 mg L- 1, of which 31 % was particulate phosphorus (PP), and the average FWMC of SS was 38. 1 mg L- 1. For the slurry treatment, there was an average FWMC of 2. 2 mg TP L- 1, 47 % of which was PP, and the average FWMC of SS was 71. 5 mg L- 1. Ranked in order of effectiveness from best to worst, PAC reduced the average FWMC of TP to 0. 64 mg L- 1 (42 % PP), FeCl 3 reduced TP to 0. 91 mg L- 1 (52 % PP) and alum reduced TP to 1. 08 mg L- 1 (56 % PP). The amendments were in the same order when ranked for effectiveness at reducing SS: PAC (74 %), FeCl 3 (66 %) and alum (39 %). Total phosphorus levels in runoff plots receiving amended slurry remained above those from soil only, indicating that, although incidental losses could be mitigated by chemical amendment, chronic losses from the high P index soil in the current study could not be reduced.
