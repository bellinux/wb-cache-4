50|$|ENO1 {{overexpression}} {{has been}} associated with multiple tumors, including glioma, neuroendocrine tumors, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer. In many of these tumors, ENO1 promoted cell proliferation by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and induced tumorigenesis by activating plasminogen. Moreover, ENO1 is expressed on the tumor cell surface during pathological conditions such as inflammation, autoimmunity, and malignancy. Its role as a plasminogen receptor leads to extracellular matrix degradation and cancer invasion. Due to its surface expression, targeting surface ENO1 enables selective targeting of tumor cells while leaving the ENO1 inside normal cells functional. Moreover, in tumors such as Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NHLs) and breast cancer, inhibition of ENO1 expression decreased tolerance to hypoxia while increasing <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy, thus indicating that ENO1 may have aided chemoresistance. Considering these factors, ENO1 holds great potential to serve as an effective therapeutic target for treating many types of tumors in patients.|$|E
40|$|Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (ataxia-telangiectasia–like {{syndrome}} [AOA]; MIM 208920) is an autosomal re-cessive disorder {{characterized by}} ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and choreoathetosis. These neurological features {{resemble those of}} ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), but in AOA there are none of the extraneurological features of AT, such as immunodeficiency, neoplasia, chromosomal instability, or <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> ionizing <b>radiation.</b> It is unclear whether these patients have a true disorder of chromosomal instability or a primary neurodegenerative syndrome, {{and it has not}} been possible to identify the defective gene in AOA, since the families have been too small for linkage analysis. We have identified a new family with AOA, and we show that the patients have no evidence of chromosomal instability or <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> ionizing <b>radiation,</b> suggesting that AOA in this family is a true primary cerebellar ataxia. We have localized the disease gene, by linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping, to a 15. 9 -cM interval on chromosome 9 q 34.

40|$|We {{examined}} telomere maintenance {{in cells}} of 11 primary fibroblast cell lines with differing genetic defects that confer <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> ionizing <b>radiation.</b> These included cell lines derived from patients with ataxia telangiectasia, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, Fanconi anemia, defective Artemis, DNA ligase I and DNA ligase IV, an immunodeficient {{patient with a}} defect in DNA double-strand break repair, and a patient diagnosed with xeroderma pigmentosum who, in addition, showed severe clinical <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> ionizing <b>radiation.</b> Our results, based on Southern blot, flow-FISH and Q-FISH (quantitative FISH) measurements, revealed an accelerated rate of telomere shortening in most cell lines derived from the above patients compared to cell lines from normal individuals or a cell line isolated from a heterozygotic parent of one radiosensitive patient. This accelerated telomere shortening was accompanied by the formation of chromatin bridges in anaphase cells, indicative of the early loss of telomere capping function {{and in some cases}} low levels of chromosome abnormalities in metaphase cells. We also analyzed telomere maintenance in mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in Brca 1, another defect that confers radiosensitivity. Similarly, these cells showed accelerated telomere shortening and mild telomere dysfunction in comparison to control cells.

5000|$|Ataxia {{telangiectasia}} (AT) {{is a rare}} {{human disease}} characterized by cerebellar degeneration, extreme cellular <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>radiation</b> and a predisposition to cancer. All AT patients contain mutations in the ATM gene (ATM). Most other AT-like disorders are defective in genes encoding the MRN protein complex. One feature of the ATM protein is its rapid increase in kinase activity immediately following double-strand break formation. The phenotypic manifestation of AT {{is due to the}} broad range of substrates for the ATM kinase, involving DNA repair, apoptosis, G1/S, intra-S checkpoint and G2/M checkpoints, gene regulation, translation initiation, and telomere maintenance. Therefore, a defect in ATM has severe consequences in repairing certain types of damage to DNA, and cancer may result from improper repair. AT patients have an increased risk for breast cancer that has been ascribed to ATM's interaction and phosphorylation of BRCA1 and its associated proteins following DNA damage. [...] Certain kinds of leukemias and lymphomas, including Mantle cell lymphoma, T-ALL, atypical B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and T-PLL are also associated with ATM defects.|$|E
5000|$|Proteins that {{function}} in the G2-M checkpoint were originally identified in yeast screens that looked for mutants which show enhanced <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>radiation,</b> termed [...] "rad" [...] mutants. Inefficient repair of DNA damaged by ionizing radiation or chemical agents in these mutants revealed proteins essential in this pathway. Early signaling proteins in the checkpoint pathway {{are members of a}} family of phosphotidylinositol 3-kinases, rad3 in yeast and ATR in vertebrates, that are believed to localize to sites of DNA damage. Rad3 phosphorylates rad26 which is required to initiate, but not maintain the checkpoint. Rad3 also phosphorylates a number of other proteins whose absence abolishes checkpoint DNA repair, including rad1, rad9, hus1 and rad17. It has been hypothesized that rad9, hus 1 and rad 17 are similar to proteins involved in forming the clamp that increases the processivity of DNA polymerase during DNA replication. In agreement with this idea, rad17 is similar to proteins involved in loading the clamp onto DNA. This supports a model where phosphorylation by rad3 causes recruitment of these proteins to sites of DNA damage where they mediate the activity of DNA polymerases involved in DNA repair.|$|E
