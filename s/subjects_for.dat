40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} the temporality aspect of verbs in the Western Dani Language (WDL) in Papua. The data were from Morfologi Bahasa Dani Barat, a research report by Purba, et al. (1994). The temporality was proved by the distributional method supplemented by permutation and deletion techniques. The findings show that WDL has nine verb forms. Those are ones with: 1) a singular <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the present tense, 2) a singular <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the recent past tense, 3) a singular <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the remote past tense, 4) a singular <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the future tense, 5) a plural <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the present tense, 6) a plural <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the recent past tense, 7) a plural <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the remote past tense, 8) a plural <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the future tense, and 9) the habitual present tense. Temporality verb forms are classified into two groups: eight verbs based on the time an event occurs and one verb of a habitual event. The nine verbs showing time are distinguished {{on the basis of}} singular and plural subjects...|$|R

5|$|CTW {{solicited}} the Educational Testing Service (ETS) {{to conduct}} its summative research. CTW and ETS hired and trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local communities to conduct these studies. The most relevant {{tests of the}} show's effectiveness were comparisons between children who watched it regularly {{and those who did}} not. After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely watched that it was difficult to make this distinction; ETS began to have problems finding <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem by selecting control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E
5|$|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{journalist}} Carol Off began {{research to}} write a biography of Louise Arbour. Following input from fellow journalist and author Stevie Cameron, she broadened the book's scope to include profiles of Roméo Dallaire and Lewis MacKenzie. Along with her research assistant Sian Cansfield, they compiled twenty binders of research and conducted over a hundred interviews, including with the three <b>subjects.</b> <b>For</b> the historical background on Rwanda, she consulted the works of Gérard Prunier, Philip Gourevitch, Alison Des Forges, and the Human Rights Watch. For background on the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, she consulted, amongst others, the works of Noel Malcolm, David Rieff, Roy Gutman. Living in Toronto with husband Linden MacIntyre, the 45-year-old author wrote the book {{in the spring and}} summer of 2000.|$|E

5|$|German doctors {{performed}} {{a wide variety}} of experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz. SS doctors tested the efficacy of X-rays as a sterilization device by administering large doses to female prisoners. Prof Dr Carl Clauberg injected chemicals into women's uteruses in an effort to glue them shut. Bayer, then a subsidiary of IG Farben, bought prisoners to use as research <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> testing new drugs. Prisoners were also deliberately infected with spotted fever for vaccination research and exposed to toxic substances to study the effects.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} form, pupils study five AS-level (the {{equivalent}} of half an A-level qualification) <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> one year, which may include General Studies and usually continue {{with three or}} four subjects to A-level. A wide choice of subjects is offered at A-level: English, French, German, Latin, Classical Civilisation, Art, Design and Technology, Music, Geography, History, Economics, Government and Politics, Business Studies, Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Religious Studies and P.E. Most combinations of subjects can be accommodated. All students participate in a games activity on a Wednesday afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, as the {{industrial}} revolution took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate the viewer to aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost. Wrestling and boxing thus were popular <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights {{of one kind or}} another. It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered desirable, and the discipline to hold a pose for long periods in the studio.|$|E

5|$|Particularly for kings, itineration was a {{vital part}} of governance, and in many cases kings would rely on the {{hospitality}} of their <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> maintenance while on the road. This could be a costly affair for the localities visited; there was not only the large royal household to cater for, but also the entire royal administration. It was only {{towards the end of the}} medieval period, when means of communication improved, that households, both noble and royal, became more permanently attached to one residence.|$|E

5|$|As of 2010, {{the school}} follows the National Curriculum in Years 7–11 {{and offers a}} broad range of GCSEs (national exams taken by {{students}} aged 14–16) and A-levels (national exams taken by pupils aged 16–18). The school has no affiliation with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school, and boys may opt to take the subject as part of their GCSE course. Although morning assemblies take place and are Christian in nature, they are non-denominational. Students participate in a number of educational visits and excursions throughout their school career and Year Eleven students participate in a nine-day work experience programme. The curriculum comprises English and Drama, Mathematics, French, Latin, History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Art, Music, Design Technology, Religious Education, Physical Education (P.E.) and Games and Personal, Social and Health Education (P.S.H.E.). In the second year German is added and in Mathematics, students are divided based on their ability. The use of Information Technology is central to all teaching and is taught as a discrete subject in Years 7 and 8. Boys usually take ten <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> GCSE, English (Language and Literature), Mathematics, a foreign language, all three separate sciences or Dual Certificate Science, supplemented by three other subjects from those listed above.|$|E

5|$|At Auschwitz, {{the actual}} {{delivery}} of gas {{to the victims}} was always handled by the SS, {{on the order of}} the supervising SS doctor. Many of the SS doctors also conducted inhumane medical experiments on camp prisoners. The most infamous SS doctor, Josef Mengele, served as a medical officer at Auschwitz under the command of Eduard Wirths of the camp's medical corps. Mengele undertook selections even when he was not assigned {{to do so in the}} hope of finding <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> his experiments. He was particularly interested in locating sets of twins. In contrast to most of the doctors, who viewed undertaking selections as one of their most stressful and horrible duties, Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling a tune. After the war, many SS doctors were charged with war crimes for their inhumane medical experiments and for their role in gas chamber selections.|$|E
5|$|In 1680, Zotov {{embarked}} on a three-year diplomatic mission to the Crimea; sources disagree on whether this was before or after he tutored Peter. When Peter left the Kremlin to spend his childhood at Preobrazhenskoye, two years after Zotov's departure, his memories of the tutors who had taught his siblings, Feodor and Sophia, were so negative that he cut himself off from traditional academic <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> a time. He later resumed his studies under Afanassyi Nesterov and Zotov after the latter's return from the Crimea. Although Peter sought to learn of nature and military matters rather than literature or theology, he nevertheless {{learned a great deal}} of the latter from his tutors. Zotov (and later his sons) later worked with Peter to translate books about fortification from a Western European language into Russian. Peter did not learn, or forgot, a great deal about mathematics, a subject that he had to learn properly in his late teens for use in siege warfare and fortification. In later years, Peter regretted his lack of a fuller education, and sought to give his daughters Anne and Elizabeth educations equivalent of any European princess.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders' {{march through}} Anatolia was {{thereafter}} unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything {{he left behind}} in his army's flight. It {{was the middle of}} summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died. Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the Cilician Gates, Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the Euphrates; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by Thoros of Edessa, a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> his Greek Orthodox religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated. Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the County of Edessa, the first of the crusader states.|$|E

5|$|When {{war broke}} out again in 1282, it was an entirely {{different}} undertaking. For the Welsh, this war was over national identity, enjoying wide support, provoked particularly by attempts to impose English law on Welsh <b>subjects.</b> <b>For</b> Edward, it became a war of conquest rather than simply a punitive expedition, like the former campaign. The war started with a rebellion by Dafydd, who was discontented with the reward he had received from Edward in 1277. Llywelyn and other Welsh chieftains soon joined in, and initially the Welsh experienced military success. In June, Gloucester was defeated at the Battle of Llandeilo Fawr. On 6November, while John Peckham, archbishop of Canterbury, was conducting peace negotiations, Edward's commander of Anglesey, Luke de Tany, decided {{to carry out a}} surprise attack. A pontoon bridge had been built to the mainland, but shortly after Tany and his men crossed over, they were ambushed by the Welsh and suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Moel-y-don. The Welsh advances ended on 11December, however, when Llywelyn was lured into a trap and killed at the Battle of Orewin Bridge. The conquest of Gwynedd was complete with the capture in June 1283 of Dafydd, who was taken to Shrewsbury and executed as a traitor the following autumn.|$|E
