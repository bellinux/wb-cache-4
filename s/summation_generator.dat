50|$|An {{attack against}} the {{improved}} <b>summation</b> <b>generator</b> was reported by Mex-Perera and Shepherd in 2002 by exploiting linear relations. Besides, in June 2005 an algebraic attack was developed. Using this attack a PC can calculate the initial state of the <b>summation</b> <b>generator</b> within 3 minutes even with 256 bit LFSRs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>summation</b> <b>generator,</b> {{created in}} 1985, by Rainer Rueppel, was a {{cryptography}} and security front-runner {{in the late}} 1980s. It operates by taking the output of two LFSRs through an adder with carry. The operation's strength {{is that it is}} nonlinear. However, through the early 1990s various attacks against the <b>summation</b> <b>generator</b> eventually led to its fall to a correlation attack. In 1995 Klapper and Goresky were able to determine the summation generator's sequence in only 219 bits.|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{procedure for}} applying fast correlation attacks to combiners with memory is introduced. This procedure {{consists of the}} following four stages: identifying correlated linear input and output transforms with maximum possible or relatively large correlation coefficient, calculating low-weight polynomial multiples based on the identified input linear transform, applying an iterative error correction algorithm to the linear transform of the observed keystream and solving several sets of linear equations to determine the initial state of the input LFSRs. This procedure is successfully applied to three keystream <b>generators,</b> namely, the <b>summation</b> <b>generators</b> with three and five inputs, the nonlinear filter generator and the multiplexed sequence generator. 1 Introduction A well-known type of keystream generator for stream cipher applications consists {{of a number of}} linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) combined by a memoryless nonlinear function.

40|$|In its {{intended}} usage the lengths {{of the key}} stream sequences produced by the Bluetooth stream cipher E 0 are strictly limited. In this paper {{the importance of this}} limitation is proved by showing that the Bluetooth stream cipher with 128 bit key can be broken in O(2 64) steps given an output key stream segment of length O(2 64). We also show how the correlation properties of the E 0 combiner can be improved by making a small modication in the memory update function. 1 Introduction Bluetooth TM is a standard for wireless connectivity specied by the Bluetooth TM Special Interest Group in [1]. The specication denes a stream cipher algorithm E 0 to be used for point-to-point encryption between the elements of a Bluetooth network. The structure of E 0 is a modication of a <b>summation</b> bit <b>generator</b> with memory. In this paper we call it the Bluetooth combiner and analyze its correlation properties.

40|$|ABSTRACT Recordings {{were made}} from single fibers of the rat chorda tympani nerve while the {{peripheral}} receptor fields were mapped using a stimulator developed to stimulate single fungiform papillae which in the rat contain a solitary taste bud. The results indicate that several fungiform papillae may supply input to a single fiber, and the most sensitive papilla of these provided, on the average, about one-half of the response of that fiber to stimulation of the entire tongue. The magnitude of the response to each concentration of stimulus and {{the shape of the}} concentration-response curves differ among papillae innervated by the same fiber. If one of the papillae supplying input to the fiber was stimulated individually with NaCl solution, application of this stimulus to the tongue surface surrounding the isolated papilla resulted in enhancement of the fiber response. If the papilla was stimulated with NaCl and potassium benzoate solution was applied to the surround, a depression of the response occurred. The excitatory input of the cationic stimuli and the depressing influence of the anionic stimuli interacted to determine the resultant steady-state impulse frequency of the single afferent fiber. A hypothetical model involving the <b>summation</b> of <b>generator</b> currents along the unmyelinated terminals of the single afferent neuron is presented as a speculative explanation of the integration of inputs from several receptors innervated by the same single fiber...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of spike discharge in eccentric cell axons from the in situ lateral eye of Limulus, under small sinusoidal modulation {{of light to}} which the eye is adapted, are described over two decades of light intensity and nearly three decades of frequency. Steady-state lateral inhibition coefficients, derived from the very low-frequency response, average 0. 04 at three interommatidial spacings. The gain vs. frequency of a singly illuminated ommatidium is described closely from 0. 004 to 0. 4 cps by the linear transfer function s 0. 25; this function also accounts approximately for the measured phase leads, the small signal adaptation following small step inputs, and for Pinter's (1966) earlier low-frequency generator potential data. We suggest that such dynamics could arise from a <b>summation</b> in the <b>generator</b> potential of distributed intensity-dependent relaxation processes along the dendrite and rhabdome. Analysis of the dynamic responses of an eccentric cell with and without simultaneously modulated illumination of particular neighbors indicates an effect equivalent to self-inhibition acting via a first-order low-pass filter with time constant 0. 42 sec, and steady-state gain near 4. 0. The corresponding filters for lateral inhibition required time constants from 0. 35 to 1 sec and effective finite delay of 50 – 90 msec...|$|R

In this survey paper, we describe generic attacks: existence of algebraic equations and fast algebraic attacks. The generic attacks only states the existence and gives the upper bound of the complexity. Thus we should find good algebraic equations, case by case, in order to apply the attack to a specific stream cipher. We also review some stream ciphers attacked: Toyocrypt, LILI- 128, E 0, and <b>summation</b> <b>generator.</b> 1...|$|E

It generalize {{the definition of}} Algebraic Immunity for Stream Cipher to any finite field and also Block Cipher. This algebraic immunity correspond to equations with low leading term according a monomial ordering. We give properties of this Algebraic Immunity and also compute explicit and asymptotic bounds. We extended the definitions of Algebraic Immunity to functions with memory but they depend {{on the number of}} consecutive outputs we look at. We show that all the results obtained for memoryless function give similarly results on memory functions by a change of variables. And then, we prove that, for a memory function f with memory size l and only one output, if there is no relation which not depend on memory for l consecutive output, than we can construct a polynomial that generate all relations without memories.

40|$|Recently {{proposed}} algebraic attack {{has been}} shown to be very effective on several stream ciphers. In this paper, we have investigated the resistance of PingPong family of stream ciphers against algebraic attacks. This stream cipher was proposed in 2008 to enhance the security of the improved <b>summation</b> <b>generator</b> against the algebraic attack. In particular, we focus on the PingPong- 128 stream cipher’s resistance against algebraic attack in this paper. In our analysis, it is found that an algebraic attack on PingPong family of stream ciphers require much more operations compare to the exhaustive key search on the internal state of the LFSRs. It will be shown that due to the irregular and mutual clock controlling in PingPong stream cipher the degree of the generated equation tends to grow up with each successive clock which in turn increases the overall complexity of an algebraic attack. Along with the PingPong 128 stream cipher the other instances of PingPong family stream ciphers are also investigated against the algebraic attack. Our analysis shows that, PingPong family stream ciphers are highly resistant against the algebraic attack due to their mutual and irregular clocking function...|$|E
