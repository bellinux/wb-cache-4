One such {{design is}} called the <b>supercritical</b> <b>aerofoil.</b> It is used for near-supersonic flight, and produces a higher lift to drag ratio at near supersonic flight than traditional aerofoils. Supercritical aerofoils employ a flattened upper surface, highly cambered (curved) aft section, and greater leading edge radius as compared to traditional aerofoil shapes. These changes delay the onset of wave drag.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{model of}} the aerodynamics of rotor blades in forward flight is proposed in which {{the motion of the}} blade is represented by periodical variations of the freestrearn velocity and incidence. A novel implicit methodology for the solution of the compressible Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations and a twoequation model of turbulence is developed. The spatial discretisation is based upon Osher's approximate Riernann solver, while time integration is performed using a Newton-Krylov method. The method is employed to calculate the steady transonic aerodynamics of two <b>supercritical</b> <b>aerofoils</b> and the unsteady aerodynamics of pitching aerofoils. Comparison with experiment and independent calculations for these test cases is satisfactory. Further calculations are performed for the self-excited periodic flow around a biconvex aerofoil. Comparison of quasi-steady and unsteady calculations suggests that the flow instability responsible for the self-excited flow is due to the presence of a shock induced separation bubble in the corresponding steady flow. Finally the method is used to predict the aerodynamics of aerofoils performing inplane and combined inplane-pitching motions. Results show that quasi-steady aerodynamic models are unsuitable at conditions representative of high-speed forward flight. For shock free flows, the unsteady effects of freestrearn oscillations can be represented by a simple phase lag. For transonic flows the influence of unsteadiness on shock wave dynamics is shown to be complex. Calculations for indicial motion show that the unsteady behaviour of the flow is related to the finite time taken by disturbance waves to travel to the shock wave from the leading and trailing edges of the aerofoil...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods are}} {{presented}} for {{the calculation of}} transonic flows. Firstly a method is described {{for the design of}} aerofoils with prescribed pressure distributions including shock waves. The method is essentially an inversion of a numerically refined version of the Murman-Krupp technique for the solution of the transonic small perturbation equation with linearized boundary conditions. To demonstrate the usefulness and accuracy of the method examples are shown of the design of <b>supercritical</b> type <b>aerofoil</b> sections, the final results being compared with calculations by the nominally exact Garabedian & Korn analysis method.

The resulting Cauchy problem is then solved with the linearised flow solution as the initial value vector. For the case of embedded shocks in the flow field, the method of steepest descent has been added to the calculation scheme.

40|$|For modern {{transonic}} transport aeroplanes, it {{is important}} to produce low drag at high cruise speeds. The root effect, caused by effects of symmetry on swept wings, decreases the performance of these aeroplanes. During aeroplane design, root modifications are applied to counteract this decrease in performance. Most conceptual aeroplane design tools do not have a method for design of the root aerofoil. However, the design of the root aerofoil has a significant influence on the properties of the final design, since it transfers the loads from the wing to the fuselage. Therefore, having a conceptual method for design of the wing root aerofoil will increase the accuracy of a conceptual aeroplane design. For conceptual design, computational times are important, to allow the designer to try different approaches and {{get a feel for the}} design. In this report a method is developed to approximate the root aerofoil design to achieve straight isobars on a wing of any given shape, within computational times that are suitable for conceptual design. First a method is developed for estimating the pressure distribution over the root aerofoil of a given wing. This is done by combining a method for estimation of the root effect due to thickness, a method for estimation of the root effect due to lift, a Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and a two-dimensional panel method. A full potential method, MATRICS-V, is used to verify the results of the method, because of its proven validity. It is shown that the results of the first part of the method are generally in good agreement with results found by MATRICS-V. The effects of wing sweep, wing taper and addition of a wing kink can be modelled with results that are in good agreement with the verification data. For aft swept wings with positive lift, the pressure near the leading edge is underestimated. For forward swept wings with positive lift, the pressure on the upper surface is overestimated. For wings with a cambered aerofoil an inaccuracy occurs over the forward part of the profile. The general shape of the curve, however, is captured. Secondly, this method is coupled with an optimisation method for the root aerofoil, using Class-Shape function Transformation (CST) parametrisation. The target of the optimisation is set to achieve a similar pressure distribution over the wing root aerofoil as the pressure distribution over the outboard section of the wing. For the developed method, it is difficult to show that the results are valid, since there is no method that has a one-to-one match with the method developed. Therefore, the results are compared to the general characteristics observed in actual root aerofoil designs. The method shows the characteristic behaviour in terms of change in camber, change in location of maximumthickness and change in incidence angle. The increase in thickness, however, is not present. This is caused by the fact that the lower surface pressure distribution is also set as a target. In actual aeroplane design the lower surface is of less importance. In the method developed, however, it is of importance to retain the shape of specific <b>aerofoil</b> designs, like <b>supercritical</b> <b>aerofoils,</b> during optimisation. As a final verification, an optimised root aerofoil design is analysed using MATRICS-V. The results show that the root section pressure distribution is in good agreement with the outboard pressure distribution. In terms of computational time, the method is shown to generally produce reliable results within 30 seconds.

40|$|Within {{a narrow}} {{transonic}} flight region, shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions yield large amplitude, self sustained shock oscillations that are detrimental to both platform handling quality and structural integrity.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present research work consists in studying complex aerodynamic flows about typical aerospace configuration, in which turbulence effects play a fundamental role. Such study is performed with an available computational tool that is being developed at CTA/IAE. This is a finite-volume code for unstructured 3 -D meshes that solves the compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Turbulence effects are added to this numerical tool through turbulence models. Similar work had already been initiated by the author in his master thesis at ITA with less advanced model in that context. Turbulence effects are critical for complex aerospace configurations, such as <b>supercritical</b> or high-lift <b>aerofoils,</b> or space vehicles at atmospheric transonic or supersonic flight, and less advanced turbulence models fail to adequately describe such flows. The investment in more complex turbulence models, such as {em nonlinear} eddy viscosity and Reynolds-stress transport closures, is of fundamental importance to better capture such flows, which are very important {{in the context of}} the developments within the aerospace area at CTA/IAE and Embraer. Furthermore, in order to allow for a robust and efficient numerical framework, effort is also driven towards convergence acceleration techniques such as multigrid and variable time stepping procedures, as well as convective flux computation schemes suitable for boundary layer and shocked flows. These flux schemes must be robust and accurate even for highly stretched meshes that support these flow phenomena at reasonable computational costs. The validation of these new implementations, for the applications of interest, is performed by comparison of numerical results with experimental or theoretical data for several flow cases. Flows involving laminar boundary layers and shock waves are used to assess the quality of the convective flux computation schemes. Traditional turbulent-flow validation cases, such as the turbulent boundary layers over a flat plate or within a parallel-wall channel, are considered to address the level of physical representativeness of the chosen models. Finally, typical aerospace flows are evaluated with the best numerical settings resulting from the previously mentioned efforts. Such cases involve transonic and high-lift aerofoils, and transonic and supersonic flows about a space vehicle. In general, good agreement of numerical results with the reference data is obtained...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{turbulent}} transition on {{the onset of the}} transonic buffeting over the supercritical LV 2 F aerofoil is numerically investigated in the paper. The in-house RANS code validation has been done on 14 % and 18 % thick biconvex aerofoils {{as well as on the}} NACA 0012 aerofoil. The importance in the results accuracy of both turbulence modelling and shock capturing approach employed is pointed out.

40|$|Internal weapons bays are {{becoming}} increasingly common on aircraft for reasons of stealth and aerodynamic performance, and {{will be even more}} prevalent on coming generations of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). Wind tunnel testing of store releases to assess forces and moments for safety and clearance must be conducted with a store mounted to an angled strut rather than a conventional rear sting, to allow the full range of motion as the store "drops" from inside the aircraft. Interference from this strut can disrupt the flowfields and thus the reliability of moments obtained, and therefore an investigation was conducted to quantify the potential extent of discrepancies; original small-scale transonic wind tunnel testing was undertaken in a limited program which was supported by extensive numerical work.

The performance and sensitivity of several circulation control devices {{applied to a}} <b>supercritical</b> <b>aerofoil</b> are assessed. Different Coanda devices were studied to assess the effect of Coanda radius-to-slot height ratio, nozzle shape and Coanda surfaces with a step. The range of operating conditions for which a supersonic Coanda jet remained attached at transonic freestream conditions were extended by increasing the radius of curvature at the slot exit for Coanda devices with a converging nozzle. Additional improvements were found by reducing the strength of shock boundary-layer interactions on the Coanda surface by expanding the jet flow using a converging-diverging nozzle and also by introducing a step between the Coanda surface and the nozzle exit. The performance when using a converging-diverging nozzle can be matched using a simple stepped Coanda device. It is shown that circulation control {{has the potential to}} match the performance of traditional control surfaces during regimes of attached flow at transonic speeds, up to an equivalent aileron deflection angle of 10 °.

40|$|The {{application}} of a previously-developed computational method {{to the prediction of}} high-lift performance for multi-element aerofoil sections operating at transonic flow conditions is described. The flows are computed by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, using a full differential Reynolds-stress turbulence model to evaluate the various Reynolds-stress components appearing in the governing mean-flow equations. Algebraic wall functions are used to bridge the molecular-viscosity dominated region immediately adjacent to the aerofoil surfaces. An unstructured-grid based Computational Fluid Dynamics methodology is used to deal with the geometric complexity of the multi-element aerofoil configurations.

40|$|The dawn of {{research}} on shock and boundary layer interaction control {{dates back to the}} 1970 s, when humped transonic aerofoils were first studied as a means to improve the performance of <b>supercritical</b> <b>aerofoil</b> technology at off-design conditions. Since then, shock control bumps (SCBs) {{have been found to be}} promising devices for such kind of flow control. They have a smearing effect on the shock wave structure achieved through isentropic pre-compression of the flow upstream of the main shock and can significantly lower wave drag without incurring unacceptable viscous losses. However, their performance is strongly dependent on a set of geometrical parameters which must be adjusted according to the ever-changing flight conditions. A concept for an adaptive SCB is therefore presented. The proposed actuation mechanism aims at a compact, lightweight and simple structure which could be integrated in the spoiler region of near-future aircraft without major design changes required. Numerical optimization of a simplified analytical model of the structure is used to investigate the SCB adaptation to various aerodynamic target shapes. Compromises between geometrical conformity and both structural and actuation related requirements are studied. Furthermore, an outlook is given on design issues related to three-dimensional effects on a finite-width SCB...|$|E
40|$|Aerodynamic {{investigations}} have shown' that variable camber wings (VCW) for transport aircraft have considerable potential {{in terms of}} improving aircraft performance and enhancing their operational flexibility. In order to justify these benefits {{it is essential that}} the camber varying system is structurally and mechanically feasible. This research examined the feasibility of providing variable camber to two <b>supercritical</b> <b>aerofoil</b> sections of different'characteristics. The unique method of camber vaTiation was applied by rotating the forward and aft regions of the aerofoil on a circular arc and keeping the surface continuous and matching at their attachment to the main wing box. The change in camber thus increased the chord due to translational motion of the aforementioned regions. The geometries required for varying the forward camber by this method presented formidable design difficulties and no immediate solutions could be found. As a result, an alternative geometry was devised which accepts camber by simply drooping the nose region. A novel idea was developed for aft camber variation, which is considered to be universal for all <b>supercritical</b> <b>aerofoil</b> sections. The system utilises a tracking mechanism which guides a trailing edge element on a continuous arc. Surface continuity is provided by a flexible skin on the upper side and a spring loaded hinged panel on the under side. The flexible skin remains attached to the trailing edge element through a series of roller link arrangement which locate the skin in a separate guide rail. The large moment arm and therefore the increased torsional loads created due to the translational motion of the trailing edge element necessitated investigation of alternative deployment geometries. As a result two additional geometries were schemed. One had reduced radius of rotation and therefore reduced extension, while the other changed camber by drooping the aft region without any chordal extension. Since there was no aerodynamic evidence on the possible benefits offered by these geometries it was decide to postpone them until such information was available. Some detailed aspects of the proposed concept for aft camber variation were considered by applying the system to a modem transport aircraft wing. This resulted in a design which is practically feasible. Justification of this concept was made by designing and testing a half scale structural model of one trailing edge segment. Three dimensional (3 -D) geometric investigation showed that the camber-varying elements ride on a frustum of a cone and therefore their deployment is skewed to the line of flight. The 3 -D geometric implications of variable camber clearly suggested that the camber variation by rotation on a circular arc, on a tapered wing can be possible if the rotating element is made to flex and twist or it utilises a pin jointed arrangement. To provide the necessary flexibility to the trailing edge element, its structural box best be made from fibre reinforced plastic material. The deployment of the trailing edge element on the structural m(; del was made possible by designing it in laminated wood. Comparison of the proposed variable camber system with a conventional single slotted flap arrangement suggests that the two systems could be equally complex but the variable camber could be slightly heavier., Further systems investigations are required to quantify overall aerodynamic, mass, and cost implications of the use of VCW on transport aircraft...|$|E
