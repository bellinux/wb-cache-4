500|$|A musical, <b>Sunny</b> <b>Afternoon,</b> {{based on}} the early life of Ray Davies and the {{formation}} of the Kinks, opened at the Hampstead Theatre in April 2014. The musical's name came from the band's 1966 hit single [...] "Sunny Afternoon" [...] and features songs from the band's back catalogue.|$|E
500|$|Come Dancing {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The Daily Telegraph spoke positively of the production, calling it [...] "a winning show that deserves a bright future." [...] The Times, however, criticized it for lacking a story-line, {{saying it was}} [...] "a ragged and sentimental montage of scenes sorely in need of narrative." [...] Davies would later premiere another musical, <b>Sunny</b> <b>Afternoon</b> (named after the 1966 Kinks song of the same name), in 2014, which he had written in 2005 after finding out that Come Dancing would not be staged.|$|E
500|$|... "Cherish" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and released {{as the third}} single from Like a Prayer (1989). The song is built around the themes of love and relationships, with William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet one of its major inspirations. Madonna was reading Romeo and Juliet during the breaks during rehearsals for Speed the Plow, a Broadway show {{in which she was}} starring in 1988. On the third day of the Like a Prayer recording sessions, she presented Leonard with the lyrics of [...] "Cherish", and explained that she had written the song [...] "one <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoon</b> by the beach", but later confessed that it was actually written in her make-up room. [...] "I wrote it in a superhyper-positive state of mind that I knew was not going to last", the singer recalled. Leonard introduced one line from the similar titled song by the 1960s band The Association, [...] "Cherish is the word I use", after which Madonna decided to include it on Like a Prayer. The B-side of the single release of [...] "Cherish" [...] was a previously unreleased track called [...] "Supernatural", initially composed during the recording sessions of her third studio album, True Blue and later completed in 1989. In 2009, during an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna confessed that she {{had never been able to}} predict if her songs would be successful, irrespective of her personal opinion of them. As an example, she cited [...] "Cherish" [...] as one of the most [...] "retarded" [...] songs she had written, but noted it became a commercial success. The song was also included on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection and the two-disc edition of her 2009 compilation Celebration.|$|E

5000|$|It is an {{univoltine}} species. These moth {{fly from}} May to October. They fly {{at night and}} on <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoons</b> and mainly feed on nectar of Tanacetum vulgare. [...] The larvae feed on birch and Alnus glutinosa. They overwinter in a shoot or hard male catkin of the host plants. In late March or April, larvae congregate and pupate in a cocoon under the bark.|$|R
60|$|I was {{confirmed}} in this idea {{by the fact}} of her once or twice coming downstairs on very warm <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoons,</b> and being taken by Miss Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I {{was not allowed to}} go and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the verandah.|$|R

60|$|I took Peggotty to {{the coach}} office and saw her off. She cried at parting, and confided her brother to my {{friendship}} as Ham had done. We had heard nothing of him since he went away, that <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoon.</b>|$|E
60|$|One <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoon</b> Mrs Maggot {{found herself}} in the happy {{position}} of having so thoroughly completed her round of household work that she felt at leisure {{to sit down and}} sew, while little Grace sat beside her, near the open door, rocking the cradle.|$|E
60|$|After {{the snow}} had all gone off, and the ground was dry, Jonas piled up a heap of stumps, roots, and decayed logs, in a field, {{not far from the}} brook, and one <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoon</b> he and Rollo went down to set the heaps on fire.|$|E
60|$|He was {{assigned}} to an occupation which removed him from the other workmen. The strawberry bed was put under his sole charge. And often, of mild, <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoons,</b> the knight, genial and gentle with dinner, would stroll bare-headed to the pleasant strawberry bed, and have nice little confidential chats with Israel; while Israel, charmed by the patriarchal demeanor of this true Abrahamic gentleman, {{with a smile on}} his lip, and tears of gratitude in his eyes, offered him, from time to time, the plumpest berries of the bed.|$|R
60|$|She had {{no serious}} {{acquaintance}} with anybody, {{she was too}} busy. The matron and sisters and doctors and patients were all part of her day's work, and she regarded them as such. The men she chiefly ignored: she felt much more friendly with the matron. She had many {{a cup of tea}} and many a chat in the matron's room, in the quiet, <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoons</b> when the work was not pressing. Alvina took her quiet moments when she could: for she never knew when she would be rung up by one or other of the doctors in the town.|$|R
60|$|Thus it {{happened}} that in Eustacia's brain were juxtaposed the strangest assortment of ideas, from old time and from new. There was no middle distance in her perspective: romantic recollections of <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoons</b> on an esplanade, with military bands, officers, and gallants around, stood like gilded letters upon the dark tablet of surrounding Egdon. Every bizarre effect that could result from the random intertwining of watering-place glitter with the grand solemnity of a heath, was {{to be found in}} her. Seeing nothing of human life now, she imagined all the more of what she had seen.|$|R
60|$|They went {{together}} {{across the}} churchyard, Ursula and Skrebensky, {{and ran to}} hiding in the church. It was dimmer in there than the <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoon</b> outside, but the mellow glow among the bowed stone was very sweet. The windows burned in ruby and in blue, they made magnificent arras to their bower of secret stone.|$|E
6000|$|They are all alike. I {{remember}} {{sitting in a}} garden one <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{in the suburbs of}} London. Suddenly I heard a shrill treble voice calling from a top-story window to some unseen being, presumably in one of the other gardens, [...] "Gamma, me dood boy, me wery good boy, gamma; me dot on Bob's knickiebockies." ...|$|E
60|$|One {{warm and}} still and <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoon</b> the bishop found himself looking out upon {{the waters of}} the Wash.

60|$|So on {{a bright}} <b>sunny</b> Saturday <b>afternoon,</b> when {{he should have been}} out in the field cheering the house-team on to victory against the School House, Jackson sat in the junior day-room at Dexter's copying out {{portions}} of Virgil, Aeneid Two.|$|R
5000|$|The Alto Maipo {{sub-region}} {{is located}} {{in the foothills of the}} Andes, rising from 400 m.a.s.l. to 800 m.a.s.l. (1,300 to 2,600 feet), and is strongly influenced by the mountainous climate. The mountains make the zone particularly good for viticulture because they produce a great variation in temperature between day and night. This is because the sun must first rise above the Argentinean side of the Andes before reaching the western Chilean slopes, creating cold mornings, and then sets on the western side, leading to hot, <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoons.</b> The climate, combined with the poor, porous and rocky soil, puts the vines under stress which in turn produces a characteristically bold, elegant Cabernet Sauvignon.|$|R
50|$|PV panels now {{generate}} {{as much as}} half of the jail’s {{peak power}} on <b>sunny</b> summer <b>afternoons.</b> Throughout the year, solar contributes anaverage of 20% of the daytime electricity and 12% overall, since solar panels can not harness any sun after dark.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a splendid}} <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoon</b> when the kites were finally flown and {{attached}} to the three boats which were commanded respectively by the Captain Leo, and Alf. These three sat at the bow of each boat manipulating the regulators, and keeping the kites fluttering, while the goods and provisions were put on board. Then the Eskimo women and crews stepped in, and the stern ropes were cast loose.|$|E
60|$|It was a <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{when they}} went ashore together; {{but they did not}} find Miss Castro {{immediately}} at her hotel. It appeared that the British tourists and invalids who sojourned in the dusty Spanish city had joined hands with its leading inhabitants over the organization of a gala for the benefit of local institutions, and Miss Castro was playing the part of soothsayer in the cause of charity.|$|E
60|$|And {{then he told}} us {{the real}} history of the fish. It seemed that he had caught it himself, years ago, when he was quite a lad; not by any art or skill, but by that unaccountable luck that appears to always wait upon a boy when he plays the wag from school, and goes out fishing on a <b>sunny</b> <b>afternoon,</b> {{with a bit of}} string tied on {{to the end of a}} tree.|$|E
25|$|Darwin has a {{tropical}} savanna climate (Köppen Aw) with distinct {{wet and dry}} seasons and the average maximum temperature is remarkably similar all year round.

5000|$|... "No Ordinary Day" [...] - The {{song was}} written on a bright <b>sunny</b> winter's <b>afternoon</b> in Melbourne. Most people can relate to the early morning other-worldliness after a joyous, unexpected, sexual debut of a new relationship. Captured {{perfectly}} in this lyric, the sweet tang of adrenalin, lack of sleep and quiet excitement becomes beautifully present.|$|R
50|$|Round 11, 2002: Brisbane {{were at the}} top of {{the ladder}} undefeated at the time until they ran into the Dragons at Aussie Stadium on a <b>sunny</b> Sunday <b>afternoon.</b> The Dragons won 28-20 to inflict Brisbane's first defeat of the season, but in round 17 the Broncos got them back with a 34-22 victory at ANZ Stadium.|$|R
