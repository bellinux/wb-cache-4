40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to prepare and assess several formulations of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine to achieve a longer duration of action. Intralipid® emulsion (a soybean oil emulsion) and collagen combined with titanium oxide nanoparticles were used to develop slow release bupivacaine formulation. These formulations were tested both in vitro as a pilot study and in vivo in sheep. Collagen was extracted from bovine limed <b>split</b> <b>hide</b> (a by-product of the leather industry). The collagen as a 1 % solution was mixed with bupivacaine hydrochloride 0. 5 % aqueous solution (Marcain® 0. 5 %, AstraZeneca, New Zealand) giving a final concentration of 0. 25 % bupivacaine. Intralipid® (20 %, Fresenius Kabi Australia) and bupivacaine 0. 5 % were mixed resulting in a 0. 25 % bupivacaine lipid emulsion. Both formulations were tested in vitro pilot study {{for the release of}} bupivacaine through a dialysis membrane. The concentration of bupivacaine in the dialysate was measured using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). In the animal studies, 18 sheep were used to compare bupivacaine (control) and bupivacaine-Intralipid®, and another 18 sheep for commercial bupivacaine (control) and collagen- bupivacaine. Each sheep received a nerve block using the control or test formulation in each forelimb. The nerve block was placed {{at the level of the}} accessory digits with three injections totalling 4 mL using a 22 G needle. The efficacy was tested by manually applying a mechanical noxious stimulus with a blunt instrument below the level of the block. This test was performed first after 15 min and then at one-hour intervals. The time at which a response was observed was considered as the end-point for that formulation. In the in vitro pilot study, both collagen and Intralipid®-based formulations showed slightly more sustained release compared to the control group. However, collagen-based formulation of bupivacaine had the most sustained-release among all. In the sheep study, the Intralipid®-based formulation significantly extended the duration of the nerve block compared to the control group (P< 0. 05). On the contrary, the collagen-based formulation of bupivacaine shortened the duration of action significantly compared to control group (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, an Intralipid®-based formulation provided a more sustained action after nerve blocks in the sheep metacarpal region compared to aqueous bupivacaine or the collagen based formulation. Further research on structure and activity of collagen and its interactions with bupivacaine is required to develop a longer acting formulation...|$|E

The main {{idea is to}} express a ballot to allow voting for up to k out of the m candidates and unlimited participants. The purpose of vote is to select more than one winner among m candidates. Our result is complementary to the result by Sun peiyong' s scheme, in the sense, their scheme is not amenable for large-scale electronic voting due to flaw of ballot structure. In our scheme the vote is <b>split</b> and <b>hidden,</b> and tallying is made for Gödel encoding in decimal base without any trusted third party, and the result does not rely on any traditional cryptography or computational intractable assumption. Thus the proposed scheme not only solves the problem of ballot structure, but also achieves the security including perfect ballot secrecy, receipt-free, robustness, fairness and dispute-freeness.

50|$|Suede leather is {{made from}} the {{underside}} of the skin, primarily from lamb, although goat, calf and deer are commonly used. <b>Splits</b> from thick <b>hides</b> of cow and deer are also sueded, but, due to the fiber content, have a shaggy nap. Because suede does not include the tough exterior skin layer, suede is less durable but softer than standard ("full-grain") leather. Its softness, thinness, and pliability make it suitable for clothing and delicate uses; suede was originally used for women's gloves, thus its etymology. Suede leather is also popular in upholstery, shoes, bags, and other accessories, and as a lining for other leather products. Due to its textured nature and open pores, suede may become dirty and quickly absorb liquids.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the course}} of several books, Zizek {{develops}} a psychoanalytical account of the symbiosis between the public law and the individual subject’s own acquiescence. It is of course a non-formalist theory, suggesting that formal law alone does not achieve social order. This article applies an element of the theory empirically to a historical question: {{to the question of how}} the behaviour of juries in a particular type of 18 th-century adultery trial managed to be both the object of contemporary controversy and an expression of normative values. The social ambivalence signalled by that doubleness opens surprisingly well to Zizek’s theory that the power of law is divided between its own public form and the subjects’ expression of superego. The theory of the <b>split</b> law, the <b>hidden</b> supplement outside the system, clarifies the historically-specific example. However, the historical example also illuminates the theory: it suggests how the space for this supplement also exists within the system, which can incorporate and make use of it. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{the wake}} of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly and Ashcroft v.

Initially, a majority of district courts extended Twombly to defense pleadings, but recently the courts that have declined to extend the plausibility standard have gained majority status. This Note provides a comprehensive analysis of {{each side of the}} plausibility <b>split,</b> identifying several <b>hidden</b> assumptions motivating the district courts’ decisions. Drawing from its analysis of the two opposing positions, this Note responds to the courts that have applied plausibility pleading to affirmative defenses by identifying several fundamental flaws in their appeals to tradition, policy, and the text of Rule 8. Due to misguided reliance on historical pleading practices, an imprecise reading of Twombly, and an overestimation of the availability of discovery for unpled or stricken affirmative defenses, these courts fail to recognize that extending plausibility pleading beyond the complaint imposes an asymmetrical and unfairly onerous burden on defendants. This Note concludes that the courts that extend Twombly to affirmative defenses do so in violation of both the canons of statutory construction and the principles of the Rules Enabling Act...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to hidden order {{submission}} on Euronext, especially for the CAC 40 stocks. The goal is twofold. On the one hand, we investigate the impact of hidden order use on market depth and pretrade transparency. From the order book rebuilding, we find that there are twice more quantities available in the 5 best limits than what traders can observe on the market screens. We also show that hidden depth {{in the top of}} the order book varies a lot all along the continuous session while displayed depth is quite stable. Furthermore, we highlight that short-term volatility affects significantly hidden depth magnitude. On the other hand, we compare hidden order placement with usual order submission. We analyze order aggressiveness and interactions between the order flow and the order book. Our results suggest that hidden order traders are mainly liquidity suppliers who focus especially on the 5 best limits of the order book. They also appear to focus on a given market side at a point in time and are not concerned with what happens on the opposite market side. Finally, we find evidence of <b>splitting</b> strategies for <b>hidden</b> orders placed below the best bid or ask price...|$|R
