5|$|Before the {{manifesto}} was published, the FBI held many {{press conferences}} asking {{the public to}} help identify the Unabomber. They were convinced that the bomber was from the Chicago area (where he began his bombings), had worked or had <b>some</b> <b>connection</b> in Salt Lake City, and by the 1990s {{was associated with the}} San Francisco Bay Area. This geographical information, as well as the wording in excerpts from the manifesto that were released before the entire manifesto was published, persuaded David Kaczynski's wife, Linda, to urge her husband to read the manifesto.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, {{while the}} Claimant was serving his prison sentence, {{interest}} was briefly {{raised by the}} claims of William Cresswell, an inmate of a Sydney lunatic asylum, that he was Arthur Orton. There was circumstantial evidence that indicated <b>some</b> <b>connection</b> with Orton, and the Claimant's supporters campaigned to have Cresswell brought to England. Nothing came of this, although the question of Cresswell's possible identity remained a matter of dispute for years. In 1884 a Sydney court found the matter undecided, and ruled that the status quo should be maintained; Cresswell stayed in the asylum. Shortly {{before his death in}} 1904 he was visited by the contemporaneous Lady Tichborne, who found no physical resemblance to any member of the Tichborne family.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two words}} in the Marquesan {{language}} for dog: peto, used in the Northern Marquesas, and nuhe, used in the Southern Marquesas. The former {{might have been an}} English loanword from pet or a Spanish loanword from perro (dog), although pero was an alternative for dog (kurī) in the related Māori language. According to another theory supporting its foreign origin, the name came from a New Haven dog named Pato left on Nuku Hiva by the American sea captain Edmund Fanning from 1798 to 1803. The South Marquesan Nuhe is unique in the Polynesian languages, but may have <b>some</b> <b>connection</b> to wanuhe, the word for dog in the Papuan language of the Brumer Islands. French Catholic missionary René-Ildefonse Dordillon listed two other forms: mohoʻio and mohokio in his 1904 dictionary Grammaire et dictionnaire de la langue des iles Marquises.|$|E
