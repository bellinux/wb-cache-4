It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E

25|$|The {{legend of}} Unan and Ngoor {{probably}} {{dates back to}} the Iron Age, with Unan being the woman and Ngoor the man. Although not the first human couple that the supreme deity Roog (or Koox) had created, like the legend of Jambooñ and Agaire (<b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>Point</b> of Sangomar), they form a fundamental part of Serer mythology. The legend agrees pretty much with the general consensus that a female was created first then a male. But in this narrative, it attempts to place Unan and Ngoor as the first human couple.|$|E

Similarly, he dismisses notions that the poem is primitive: it is instead a late poem, using materials left over from a vanished age: ...|$|E
500|$|I quaked {{a little}} as we began our quartet 'A Right-down Regular Royal Queen.'

[...] The very fact of her choosing this opera from all the others to be played before her shows how vivid was her sense of fun, and how truly British was her willingness to laugh at herself.

Who but I who write this, little Jessie Bond... for my song in the first act, 'When a Merry Maiden Marries.' ...|$|E

500|$|Alkan's later {{correspondence}} {{contains many}} despairing comments. In {{a letter of}} about 1861 he wrote to Hiller: [...] "I'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous... nothing worthwhile, good or useful to do... no one to devote myself to. My situation makes me horridly sad and wretched. Even musical production has lost its attraction for me for I can't <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> or goal." [...] This spirit of anomie may have led him to reject requests in the 1860s to play in public, or to allow performances of his orchestral compositions. However, {{it should not be}} ignored that he was writing similarly frantic self-analyses in his letters of the early 1830s to Masarnau.|$|E
500|$|During {{the fourth}} {{series of the}} late night spinoff show Hollyoaks Later, Mercedes' past was {{explored}} when she goes to Ibiza to celebrate her hen night. While there she was reunited with Johnny (Chris Coghill), her first love. Metcalfe said this caused a [...] "real mix of emotions for Mercedes". She went on to elaborate {{that there was a}} lot her character wanted to say to Johnny but [...] "at the same time she doesn't <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> There's a lot of anger there. But there's also a lot of excitement for Mercedes as she sees him again, because he was the guy who won her heart for the first time. The storyline also explains why Mercedes is the way she is now". Mercedes and Johnny kissed, which Metcalfe said was them just [...] "getting lost in the moment" [...] and was partly due to Mercedes having doubts about Riley's fidelity. She added that Mercedes and Johnny spend time [...] "just talking and reliving the old times, especially how he won her over in the past".|$|E
500|$|Puritans {{gained control}} of the English Parliament in the early 1640s, {{and the issue of}} polity for the Anglican church was of major {{importance}} to congregations throughout England and its colonies. [...] To address this issue, the Westminster Assembly was convened in 1643. [...] Lord Say and Seal had scrapped his plans to immigrate to New England, along with other members of Parliament. He wrote to Cotton, Hooker, and Davenport in New England, [...] "urging them to return to England where they were needed as members of the Westminster Assembly". [...] None of the three attended the meeting, where an overwhelming majority of members were Presbyterian and only a handful represented independent (congregational) interests. [...] Despite the lopsided numbers, Cotton was interested in attending, though John Winthrop quoted Hooker as saying that he couldn't <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of [...] "travelling 3,000 miles to agree with three men."

500|$|When Madonna {{finally decided}} {{to go on the}} tour, time was short and she had to prepare the show within three months. Auditioning for the dancers started around March 2001. Jamie King was signed up as the {{creative}} director and the choreographer of the show. King {{said in an interview that}} the tour [...] "was so hectic that I suffered from depressions and fell considerably ill." [...] Rehearsals continued for thirteen hours a day, five days a week, with more and more dancers joining for the show. In the end, ten dancers and two backup singers were used. Madonna had her guitarist Monte Pittman teach her to play the instrument, and she played both acoustic and electric guitar live in the show. French house music expert Stuart Price, who had worked with Madonna on remixes of her album Music, was signed as bassist and keyboards player. Clair Brothers Audio support was roped in for providing a mixture of high-tech techno sound and fusion of acoustic and trance. Madonna clarified: [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of doing a show unless you offer something that is going to mind-boggle the senses. It's not enough to get on stage and sing a song. It's all about theatre and drama and surprises and suspenses." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2008, Tao became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} after the Singapore Swimming Association (SSA) introduced a 15% levy on the cash awards given to swimmers, with about 6% {{set aside for}} youth development. As part of the government's Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP), she received S$23,750 for winning three individual titles and one team gold at the 2007 SEA Games. She was therefore [...] "taxed" [...] S$3,562.50, with S$1,425 going to youth development. Unhappy with this, Tao said: [...] "If they [...] want to cultivate youth, they should find their own money, not pay using our awards. It's through our hard work that we got the money. So, I don't <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that we should give {{the money to the}} youths." [...] She itereited that it [...] been her school and not the SSA which had borne the expense of her overseas training. The SSA said it was [...] "very disappointed" [...] with her comments, and pointed out that the association had spent [...] "easily in excess of $20,000" [...] in sending her for competitions abroad such as the World Championships, Hong Kong Open and Japan International, and a stint at the Australian Institute of Sport. SSA Vice-President Oon Jin Gee told the press, [...] "Even with the Sports School funding it, it's our taxpayers' dollars going into her development. It doesn't matter which avenue it comes from, it's still Singapore's support for her." ...|$|E
500|$|Dek Hogan of Digital Spy reacted {{negatively}} to Adam's introduction in [...] "Dalek" [...] stating he [...] "didn’t really <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of Todd Grimshaw out of Corrie popping up." [...] He suggested {{it would have}} been more entertaining had the episode featured Langley's screen mother from Coronation Street instead. Ian Hyland of the Sunday Mirror also disliked Adam's introduction, describing [...] "the introduction of a puppy-love sequence between Rose and a cute English boy" [...] as [...] "very, very irritating". SFX Magazine commented on the similarity between Adam's introduction to the future and that of Rose in [...] "The End of the World" [...] stating [...] "it was clearly a deliberate parallel on Russell's part, as part of his scheme to contrast and compare the reactions of Rose and Adam". Their website reviewer observed that Adam's [...] "comedy faint" [...] marked him out as an unsuitable traveller. Marc Edward DiPaulo of the University of Oklahoma notes that Adam's role in [...] "The Long Game" [...] is to provide satire on the media and to function as [...] "a condemnation of those who cannot stop immersing themselves in television, the Internet, iPods, and other nonstop broadcasters of what the Doctor calls [...] "useless information."" [...] Fraser McAlpine, reviewing Adam's appearances as companion for BBC America's Anglophenia blog describes him as a [...] "craven meddler" [...] and a [...] "social climber".

500|$|Galland {{continued}} his successes in the summer. On 13 June, {{he led a}} small number of Bf 109s on a patrol off the English coast and attacked a pair of No. 258 Squadron RAF Hurricanes claiming both shot down. One can be confirmed through British records as crash landing at RAF Hawkinge. It took his tally to 63. From this point on, the RAF would mount a non-stop offensive with Fighter Command over France. The Germans did not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> in these operations and soon labeled it the [...] "nonsense offensive." [...] Galland intended to engage the British and inflict maximum damage while incurring small losses. To do this he only engaged JG 26 in staffel or gruppe strength. The fighters were to scramble quickly gain height and make use of the sun and cloud to attack the enemy formation that was most vulnerable. Under these tactics many JG 26 pilots began to emerge as aces and effective commanders. On 16 June 1941, for example, JG 26 accounted for 15 enemy aircraft. Josef Priller was among those to score bringing his tally to 22. Priller would later rise to command JG 26. Galland claimed a Hurricane this day for victory number 64—though the loss cannot be confirmed in British records. On 17 June, he accounted for two Hurricanes, one from 56 and another from 242 Squadron. The following day he accounted for a No. 145 Squadron Spitfire which inflated his tally to 67—then the highest recorded tally against the Western Allies.|$|E
