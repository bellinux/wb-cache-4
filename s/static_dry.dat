Oxidation of the SiCf/SiC composite was investigated at 1200 degrees C, 1300 degrees C and 1400 degrees C, for up to 100 h in <b>static</b> <b>dry</b> air, and for up to 24 h in combustion environment. In <b>static</b> <b>dry</b> air, the composite showed mass gain with nearly parabolic oxidation kinetics. The uniform oxide scale developed cracks as oxidation progressed. Oxidation in combustion environment was performed using an oxy-acetylene flame containing CO 2 and H 2 O gases. The chemical erosion by the reaction of H 2 O with oxide scale was the likely ablation mechanism. At 1200 degrees C and 1300 degrees C, the oxidation rate was {{higher than that of}} ablation and the composite showed a net mass gain. However, at 1400 degrees C, significant ablation was observed. Localised attack by the combustion gases caused pitting of the beta-SiC seal coating. The present study shows that beta-SiC seal coating remains intact at relatively lower temperatures (below 1300 degrees C) for a shorter period of time (similar to 24 h) and is lost it at higher temperatures (similar to 1400 degrees C) by ablation...|$|E

The effects of board density, veneer thickness, and resin content on the fundamental properties of sandwich panels were examined, {{with the following}} results: (1) The dry moduli of rupture and elasticity in the parallel direction of sandwich panels with thicker veneers were superior. The dry moduli of rupture and elasticity in the parallel direction of sandwich panels with 2.0 mm thick veneer at densities of 0.4 – 0.5 g/cm 3 were 40 – 60 MPa, and 5 – 8 GPa, which were two and {{four times as much}} as those of homogeneous fiberboards, respectively.

The multimodel ensemble collectively exhibits a clear tendency for weakening SASM circulation and strengthening SASM precipitation during the twenty-first century.

Apnoeas lasted 215 +/- 35 s. Compared to control values, HR decreased by 20 beats min(- 1) and SBP and DBP increased by 23 and 17 mmHg, respectively, in the initial 20 +/- 3 s (phase I). Both HR and BP remained stable during the following 92 +/- 15 s (phase II). Subsequently, during the final 103 +/- 29 s, SBP and DBP increased linearly to values about 60 % higher than control, whereas HR remained unchanged (phase III). Cardiac output (Q') decreased by 35 % in phase I and did not further change in phases II and III.

After resumption of breathing, HR and BP returned to control values in 5 and 30 s, respectively. The time courses of cardiovascular adjustments to immersed breath-holding indicated that cardiac response took place only at the beginning of apnoea.

Various improvements to the clothing to alleviate strain while maintaining protection have been attempted. More recently, selectively permeable membranes have been introduced to improve protection, but questions are raised regarding their effect on heat strain. In this paper the use of selectively permeable membranes with low vapour resistance was compared to textile-based outer layers with similar ensemble vapour resistance. For textile-based outer layers, the effect of increasing air permeability was investigated. When comparing ensembles with a textile vs. a membrane outer layer that have similar heat and vapour resistances measured for the sum of fabric samples, a higher heat strain is observed in the membrane ensemble, as in actual wear, and the air permeability of the textile version improves ventilation and allows better cooling by sweat evaporation. For garments with identical thickness and <b>static</b> <b>dry</b> heat resistance, but differing levels of air permeability, a strong correlation of microclimate ventilation due to wind and movement with air permeability was observed. This was reflected in lower values of core and skin temperatures and heart rate for garments with higher air permeability.

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the {{parliament}} in the Netherlands in 1848 was not an established political institution, but that the institution had to be invented by its members. They wanted to establish and secure its authority through customs, rules and rituals that were to gain the status of tradition through constant practice. This book deals with the origins of these parliamentary customs. The classic parliamentary historiography has dealt primarily with the making of laws and has {{paid little attention to}} the origins of parliamentary customs, rules and rituals. Many older historians took the history of parliamentary traditions for granted and did not hold it up for discussion.

The story of its origins is important because we seem to have forgotten it, even though the House of Representatives is still perhaps the most important place for decision-making discussion about the Dutch and what they consider to be important. This book attempts to find an answer to the question where the Dutch parliamentary customs and traditions come from and how they developed in the period between the constitutional reforms of 1848 and 1888, the period now considered to be the age of West-European constitutionalism. ...|$|E
40|$|As are {{traditional}} fractionation technologies, <b>static</b> <b>dry</b> fractionation {{is a highly}} reliable technology for the consistent production of good-quality palm kernel stearin (PKS) for use as cocoa butter substitute (CBS) after total hydrogenation. A new process route now permits the production of unhardened yet high-quality CBS. Also an increase in total stearin yield can be achieved, via a successful refractionation of palm kernel olein. DSC analysis together with pilot static fractionation trials on the palm kernel olein indicates that a cooling water temperature that is too low (e. g., 17 degrees C) may result in the quick formation of unstable crystals that are possibly later converted to a more stable form. The resulting mixture of crystals with a possibly different polymorphic structure is easily squeezed through the filter cloth during filtration, whereas a slower, but more homogeneous co-crystallization occurs at higher temperature (18 degrees C or higher) and results {{in a much more}} stress-resistant slurry. Polarized light microscopy analysis confirmed that crystal size is not the only determining factor for a successful filtration. The total two-stage static fractionation of palm kernel oil (PKO) [iodine value (IV) 18] on a pilot scale results in the following three end products: PIKS IV 5 (yield: 29 %, for direct use as CBS), PK olein IV 27 (yield: 58 %), and PIKS IV 7 (yield: 13 % for use as CBS after full hydrogenation). The unhardened PKS IV 5 has outstanding melting and crystallization properties, comparable to traditional hydrogenated stearin fractions. Therefore, rather than the higher stearin yield, the reduced hydrogenation capacity is most probably the most important benefit of the two-stage static fractionation process. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The zonal and meridional {{components}} of the atmospheric general circulation are used to define a global thermodynamic stream function in <b>dry</b> <b>static</b> energy versus latent heat coordinates. Diabatic motions in the tropical circulations and fluxes driven by midlatitude eddies are found to form a single, global thermodynamic cycle. Calculations based on the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset indicate that the cycle has a peak transport of 428 Sv (Sv = 109  kg s− 1). The thermodynamic cycle encapsulates a globally interconnected heat and water cycle comprising ascent of moist air where latent heat is converted into <b>dry</b> <b>static</b> energy, radiative cooling where dry air loses <b>dry</b> <b>static</b> energy, and a moistening branch where air is warmed and moistened. It approximately follows a tropical moist adiabat and is bounded by the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship for near-surface air. The variability of the atmospheric general circulation is related to ENSO events using reanalysis data from recent years (1979 - 2009) and historical simulations from the EC-Earth coupled climate model (1850 - 2005). The thermodynamic cycle in both EC-Earth and ERA-Interim widens and weakens with positive ENSO phases and narrows and strengthens during negative ENSO phases with a high correlation coefficient.

Problem Statement: Myofascial Pain Syndrome (MPS) is {{a painful}} and {{prevalent}} muscular condition that {{is characterized by}} the development of myofascial trigger points (TrP’s). These are locally tender when active and are able to refer pain through specific patterns to other areas of the body distal from the trigger point (Manga, 2008). Myofascial trigger points are a frequently overlooked and misunderstood source of the distressingly ever-present musculoskeletal aches and pains of mankind and many authors have found that the trapezius muscle is most often the muscle that has frequent myofascial trigger points (Travell and Simons, 1999). Much debate and discussion has arisen on the merits of the fanning dry needling technique compared to that of the <b>static</b> <b>dry</b> needling technique, but research evidence is very limited. Some practitioners prefer the static technique over the fanning technique as it reduces the presence and amount of post-needling soreness, as well as reduces the possibility of penetrating a blood vessel resulting in hemorrhaging. Other practitioners prefer the fanning technique as it increases the chances of locating the loci of the TrP, as well as increasing the chances of eliciting a local twitch response and possibly making this method more effective in deactivating a TrP than the static technique. Aim of Study: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effects of static myofascial dry needling to the effects of fanning myofascial dry needling of an active trigger point (TrP 1) in the upper trapezius muscle in order to determine which of the two treatments is more effective with regards to decreasing neck pain and disability as well as increasing pressure pain threshold in patients with neck pain due to Trapezius Myofascial Pain Syndrome.

The first phase consists of frequency-dependent characterization of the wave field in which dominant frequencies are estimated by Fourier transform while corresponding wave numbers are derived from spatial gradients in cross-spectral phase over analysis tiles that can be small, allowing high-spatial resolution. Coherent spatial structures at each frequency are extracted by frequency-dependent empirical orthogonal function (EOF). In phase two, depths are found that best fit weighted sets of frequency-wave number pairs. These are subsequently smoothed in time in phase 3 using a Kalman filter that fills gaps in coverage and objectively averages new estimates of variable quality with prior estimates. Objective confidence intervals are returned.

The latter includes the long-term mean and interannual variability from 1979 to 2001 and, in the Tropics, corresponds to the large-scale overturning global monsoon and the embedded Hadley and Walker circulations. In the extratropics, it includes the quasi-stationary planetary waves, which are primarily a factor in the Northern Hemisphere winter. In addition to the mean annual cycle, results are presented for the interannual variability. In the extratropics, poleward transports of both latent and <b>dry</b> <b>static</b> energy reinforce one another. However, the results highlight strong cancellations between the transports of latent and <b>dry</b> <b>static</b> energy in the Tropics as moisture is converted into latent heat, and also between quasi-stationary and transient components in the extratropics. Hence the total energy transports and divergences are fairly seamless with latitude and the total interannual variability is substantially less than that of the components. The strong interplay between the transient and quasi-stationary waves in the atmosphere highlights the symbiotic relationship between them, as the stationary waves determine the location and intensity of the storm tracks while the transient disturbances help maintain the stationary waves. These results highlight that observationally there is a very strong constraint that the global energy budget places on atmospheric dynamics. 1...|$|R

The net radiation to space for the present climate agrees well with data from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) over the northern polar region but shows an underestimation in planetary albedo for the southern polar region. This suggests there are systematic errors in the atmospheric circulation or in the net surface energy fluxes in the southern polar region. The simulation of the future climate is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A 1 B scenario.

The focus is on the vertically integrated energy components, their monthly tendencies, transports, and divergences, using the most accurate computations in model and pressure coordinates. Approximate equations have often been used previously; although relatively small compared with the moist static energy, kinetic energy transports should be taken into account, as divergences can exceed several tens of watts per square meter. Changes in energy storage terms over a month are not negligible, as they are typically over 25 W m 22 in storm track regions. Transports of energy are meaningful only if the mass budget is closed.

40|$|Water vapor {{directly}} {{affects the}} dynamics of atmospheric eddy circulations through the release of latent heat. But {{it is difficult to}} include latent heat release in dynamical theories because of the associated nonlinearity (precipitation generally occurs where there is upward motion). A new effective static stability is derived that fundamentally captures the effect of latent heat release on moist eddy circulations. It differs from the usual <b>dry</b> <b>static</b> stability by an additive term that depends on temperature and a parameter measuring the up–down asymmetry of vertical velocity statistics. Latent heat release reduces the effective static stability experienced by eddies but cannot reduce it to zero so long as there are nonprecipitating regions of the eddies. Evaluation based on reanalysis data indicates that the effective static stability in the lower troposphere ranges from; 80 % of the <b>dry</b> <b>static</b> stability at high latitudes to; 25 % in the tropics. The effective static stability provides a solution to the longstanding problem of how to adapt dry dynamical theories to the moist circulations in the atmosphere. Its utility for climate change problems is illustrated based on simulations with an idealized general circulation model. It is shown to help account for changes in the thermal stratification of the extratropical troposphere, the extent of the Hadley cells, the intensity of extra-tropical transient eddies, and the extratropical eddy length. 1...|$|R
50|$|Two {{forms of}} lead styphnate are six-sided {{monohydrate}} crystals and small rectangular crystals. Lead styphnate is particularly sensitive to {{fire and the}} discharge of <b>static</b> electricity. When <b>dry,</b> it can readily detonate by static discharges from the human body. The longer and narrower the crystals, the more susceptible lead styphnate is to static electricity. Lead styphnate does not react with metals and is less sensitive to shock and friction than mercury fulminate or lead azide. It is stable in storage, even at elevated temperatures. As with other lead-containing compounds, lead styphnate is toxic owing to heavy metal poisoning.|$|R
40|$|The {{variability}} of zonally resolved tropical energy budgets {{in association with}} El Ni~no–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is investigated. The authorsAU 1 employ themost recent global atmospheric reanalyses from 1979 to 2011 of which they remove apparent discontinuities to obtain best possible temporal homogeneity. The growing length of record allowsmore a robust analysis of characteristic patterns of variability with cross-correlation, composite, and EOF methods. A quadrupole anomaly pattern {{is found in the}} vertically integrated energy divergence associated with ENSO, with centers over the Indian Ocean, the Indo-Pacific warm pool, the eastern equatorial Pacific, and the Atlantic. The smooth transition, particularly of the main maxima of latent and <b>dry</b> <b>static</b> energy divergence, from the western to the eastern Pacific is found to require at least two EOFs to be adequately described. The canonical El Ni~no pattern (EOF- 1) and a transition pattern (EOF- 2; referred to as El Ni~no Modoki by some authors) form remarkably coherent ENSO-related anomaly structures of the tropical energy budget not only over the Pacific but throughout the tropics. As latent and <b>dry</b> <b>static</b> energy divergences show strongmutual cancellation, {{variability of}} total energy divergence is smaller andmore tightly coupled to local sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and is mainly related to the ocean heat discharge and recharge during ENSO peak phases. The complexity of the structures throughout the tropics and their evolution during ENSO events along with their interactions with the annual cycle have often not been adequately accounted for; in particular, the El Ni~no Modoki mode is but part of the overall evolutionary patterns. 1...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To study ocular surface {{temperature}} (OST) in <b>dry</b> eyes by <b>static</b> and dynamic measures. Methods. OST was recorded on 62 dry eyes and 63 age- and sex-matched controls. Static measures were study of absolute OST at t= 0, 5, and 10 [*]s after eye opening. Dynamic measures were study of mean change and net change in OST over 10 [*]s of sustained eye opening. Ten OST indices studied were temperatures of the geometric {{center of the}} cornea (GCC), extreme temporal (T 1) and nasal conjunctiva (T 4), midtemporal (CT) and nasal conjunctiva (CN), temporal (LT) and nasal (LN) limbus, and mean (MOST), maximum (Max[*]T), and minimum (Min[*]T) temperatures of the region of interest. Results. For <b>static</b> measures, <b>dry</b> eyes recorded significantly lower GCC, MOST, Min[*]T, Max[*]T, T 4, CT, LT, LN, and CN. For dynamic measures, dry eyes had significantly steeper regression line of mean change (corresponding to greater net change) for Max[*]T 5 [*]s onward and T 4 at 3 [*]s onward. Conclusions. Both static and dynamic measures of the OST were valuable {{and can be used}} as clinical tool to assess dry eye...|$|R
40|$|A {{diagnostic}} {{study of the}} forcing of the Ferrel cell by eddy fluxes in the Northern Hemisphere is carried out. The quasi-geostrophic omega equation, and Oort and Rasmusson's (1971) data set, are used. The effects of condensation associated with the large scale motions are introduced to the omega equation by using the quasi-geostrophic moisture conservation equation. Thus, the <b>dry</b> <b>static</b> stability {{is replaced by a}} moist static stability, and the forcing of the Ferrel cell by eddy latent heat fluxes as well as sensible heat and momentum fluxes is included. Both effects tend to enhance the forcing of the Ferrel cell. The numerical analysis indicates that the effects are small in January, but in July the maximum vertical velocities are enhanced by about 30 percent...|$|R
40|$|A study {{aimed at}} gaining better {{understanding}} of the heating potential of the tropics by examining the 'apparent' heat source (Q 1), i. e. <b>dry</b> <b>static</b> energy budget, is presented. The Q 1 budget and precipitation rates over a three year period are analyzed using a routine data set: the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts analyses. A noticeable increase in the values of Q 1 during years 2 and 3 compared to year 1 was observed, which is considered to be due to the changes in the ECMWF model physics that produced larger values of upper level divergence after May 1985. There is a slow eastward progression of maximum values across the Western Pacific during the calendar year 1986 and into early 1987...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the application of}} ultra-fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a noninvasive tool to study the dispersion of a <b>dry,</b> <b>static</b> granular bed by the injection of a liquid. Spatial distributions of undispersed grains (poppy seeds) and injected water were independently imaged at sub-millimetre resolution in 2 D with ultra-fast MRI techniques. A liquid jet was observed above the bottom injection orifice, complementing optical imaging. Co-registration of the grains and water images enables {{the interaction of the}} static grains and of the liquid jet to be observed {{for the first time in}} situ. This visualization of the dispersion process can be used to identify optimal process parameters for a fast and uniform dispersion and to validate quantitatively numerical granular-fluid simulations [1]...|$|R
