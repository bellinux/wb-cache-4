5|$|Upon {{the filing}} of the application, the Court may either make an order immediately, or direct that a <b>summons</b> for the order for review of {{detention}} be issued to enable all the parties involved to present arguments to the Court. If the latter course is taken, the ex parte originating <b>summons,</b> supporting affidavit, order of court and <b>summons</b> must be served on the person against whom the order is sought. Unless the Court directs otherwise, {{it is not necessary}} for the person under restraint to be brought before the Court for the hearing of the application. In addition, the Court may order that the person be released while the application is being heard. Once the Court decides to make an order for review of detention, it will direct when the person under restraint is to be brought before the court.|$|E

50|$|<b>Summon</b> Nature's Ally: This Druid spell can <b>summon</b> one {{creature}} {{or several}} weaker creatures. It {{is similar to}} the arcane <b>Summon</b> Monster spells (which Clerics can also cast as Divine spells), and like <b>Summon</b> Monster there is a variant of <b>Summon</b> Nature's Ally for each spell level. <b>Summon</b> Nature's Ally differs from <b>Summon</b> Monster in the kind of creatures it is capable of <b>summoning.</b> Most of the available creatures are animals, although elementals, magical beasts and fey are also available.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} {{categories}} of monster cards, which are color-coded and vary in the methods {{by which they}} are <b>summoned.</b> Generally, the monsters with more difficult <b>summoning</b> methods will have higher ATK points and better card effects. Normal and Effect monsters can be Normal <b>Summoned,</b> Tribute <b>Summoned,</b> or Special <b>Summoned</b> by card effects. All other types of cards need to be Special <b>Summoned</b> by fulfilling the <b>summoning</b> requirements detailed below. Fusion, Synchro, Xyz and Link Monsters are stored in an Extra Deck separate from the Main Deck (where destroyed Pendulum Monsters are also placed). These cards may be resummoned from the graveyard provided they were successfully <b>summoned</b> beforehand, though if they are returned to the Extra Deck, the player will need to fulfill the <b>summoning</b> requirements once more to <b>summon</b> them again.|$|R
5|$|Like in {{the first}} game, Sora can summon a Disney {{character}} to aid him in battle. <b>Summons</b> will replace the two computer-controlled characters and fight alongside Sora {{for as long as}} the Drive Gauge allows, or until Sora's HP runs out. Instead of being limited to only one action, <b>Summons</b> now have a menu of their own and are capable of performing solo or cooperative actions with Sora. These actions are performed by pressing the triangle button. The Summon ability and each Drive Form are leveled up separately and by different criteria; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms, access to new abilities.|$|E
5|$|Once leave is granted, an {{applicant}} {{moves on to}} the second stage and applies for a prerogative order by filing in the High Court a document called a <b>summons</b> within the legal proceedings already started earlier. This must be done between eight and 14 days after leave {{to do so is}} granted by the Court; beyond that, the leave lapses. The applicant must serve the ex parte originating <b>summons,</b> the statement, the supporting affidavit, the order granting leave, and the <b>summons</b> by which the prerogative order is actually applied for, on all persons directly affected. Where the application relates to court proceedings and is intended to compel the court or a court official to do an act relating to the proceedings, or to quash the proceedings or any order made in them, the documents must be served on the registrar of the court and the other parties to the proceedings. The documents must also be served on the judge if his or her conduct is being objected to. If the Court is of opinion that any person who ought to have been served with the documents has not been served, the Court may adjourn the hearing on such terms as it may direct in order that the documents may be served on that person.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Middle-earth, Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë {{convinced}} a large host {{to take the}} Great Journey to Valinor. Not all Elves accepted the <b>summons</b> though, {{and those who did}} not became known as the Avari, The Unwilling.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} can <b>summon</b> a specific Eidolon into battle. These <b>summoned</b> creatures include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When <b>summoned,</b> the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is <b>summoned,</b> the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, {{in which the}} Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the <b>summoning</b> character rides them.|$|R
50|$|Other Marvel heroes can be <b>summoned</b> by {{collecting}} appropriate items hidden within certain levels. The {{locations of the}} power-ups necessary to <b>summon</b> aid are set. Depending on which character <b>summoned</b> them, the <b>summoned</b> heroes may help out in different ways, usually being more effective for whichever character (Spider-Man or Venom) they favor.|$|R
50|$|Familiars are companions of wizards and sorcerers. A Druid or Ranger cannot <b>summon</b> a {{familiar}}, but can <b>summon</b> an Animal Companion instead. Familiars can be <b>summoned</b> {{once per}} day. Multiclass ranger/druid with arcane user can <b>summon</b> both a familiar and an animal companion. These can be normal animals like panthers and pigs, {{but they can}} also be the strange creatures (Imps, Mephits, pixies, giant spiders, eyeballs, small dragons, etc.) Unlike creatures <b>summoned</b> by arcane or divine spell (Elementals, Planar Allies, Undead...), familiars do not unsummon while player is resting. They remain <b>summoned</b> until they are killed or unsummoned by player. When familiar is killed, his summoner receives some damage but he can <b>summon</b> new familiar, if he rested before combat.|$|R
5|$|After Luscinia kidnaps Liliana, who has {{the ability}} to control an Exile, Luscinia <b>summons</b> an Exile to destroy Iglasia, the capital of Turan, killing its {{soldiers}} and the King of Turan, leading to the surrender of Turan to Ades. With everything she cared for lost, Millia is given refuge by the Sky Pirates, where Fam promises to help Millia regain her kingdom.|$|E
5|$|After {{complaints}} from the dispossessed parishioners of St Faith's, {{the east end}} of the west crypt was allotted to them as their parish church. The congregation were also allowed to keep a detached tower with a peal of bells east of the church which had historically been used to peal the <b>summons</b> to the Cheapside Folkmote. The parish later moved to the Jesus chapel during the reign of Edward VI and was merged with St Augustine Watling Street after the 1666 fire.|$|E
5|$|At the Iifa tree, {{the party}} defeats Kuja, {{preventing}} him from destroying Gaia as well. The fight, so near {{what they find}} to be the Crystal, the source of life, <b>summons</b> Necron, a force of annihilation. Its defeat destroys the Tree; the party flees, while Zidane stays behind to rescue Kuja. In the epilogue one year later, the fates {{of all of the}} characters are shown, and Zidane reappears in Alexandria to see Queen Garnet.|$|E
50|$|For a character/general to be {{successfully}} <b>summoned,</b> the player must discard {{an equal number}} of hand cards as the <b>summon</b> cost of the character. All characters are <b>summoned</b> within own city/fortress unless stated. A character <b>summoned</b> on this turn cannot attack or move until the next turn unless stated otherwise(they still can activate special effects/特效 though).|$|R
50|$|The Crown, as fount of honour, has the undoubted {{right to}} create peerages, whether {{hereditary}} or for life. In {{the early days}} of the peerage, the Sovereign had the right to <b>summon</b> individuals to one Parliament without being bound to <b>summon</b> them again. Over time, it was established that once <b>summoned,</b> a peer would have to be <b>summoned</b> for the remainder of his life, and later, that the peer's heirs and successors would also be <b>summoned,</b> thereby firmly entrenching the hereditary principle.|$|R

5|$|Decius revives {{the office}} of Censor; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy {{to hold it in}} a decree dated 27 October 251. The decree is brought to Decius (on {{campaign}} against the Goths) and he <b>summons</b> Valerian to bestow the honour. The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius had been dead for several months by the date stated.|$|E
5|$|Ending C: Events {{proceed as}} in Ending B, {{but when the}} Casket attacks Manah, she manages to win the fight against it. Legna <b>summons</b> the Holy Dragons and events proceed as in Ending A.

5|$|In 17th century England, the {{magistrate}} Sir Andrew Pike (Warner) <b>summons</b> the witch-finders Mr Warren (Shearsmith) and Mr Clarke (Pemberton) {{to the village}} of Little Happens. Elizabeth Gadge (Sheen) has been accused of witchcraft, and Pike is excited that the news has attracted the attention of outsiders. Pike and Warren already seem convinced of Gadge's guilt, but Clarke remains sceptical.|$|E

5|$|In AD 515 Eutharic {{answered}} a <b>summons</b> by Theoderic the Great {{and moved to}} the Ostrogothic court at Ravenna in Italy. Here he was given in marriage Amalasuintha, the daughter of the king. It was Theoderic's intention that this union would create a long-lasting dynastic connection between the previously sundered Ostrogoths and Visigoths. Theoderic also named Eutharic his presumptive heir.|$|E
5|$|In a Christianized version, the duel {{involves}} the Christian St.Elijah and the ala, {{but there is}} a belief that the saint and the dragons in fact cooperate: as soon as St.Elijah spots an ala, he <b>summons</b> the dragons, either takes them aboard his chariot or harnesses them to it, and they jointly shoot the ala with lightning. Arrow-shaped stones, like belemnites or stone-age arrowheads, are regarded as materialized lightning bolts imbued with a beneficial magical power, and finding one is a good omen.|$|E
5|$|In response, {{and hoping}} to win wider support for his government, Montfort summoned a new {{parliament}} for 20 January 1265 which continued until mid March that year. It was held at short notice, with the <b>summons</b> being issued on 14 December, leaving little time for attendees to respond. He summoned not only the barons, senior churchmen and two knights from each county, but also two burgesses {{from each of the}} major towns such as York, Lincoln, Sandwich, and the Cinque Ports, the first time this had been done. Due to the lack of support for Montfort among the barons, only 23 of them were summoned to parliament, in comparison to the <b>summons</b> issued to 120 churchmen, who largely supported the new government; it is unknown how many burgesses were called. The event was overseen by King Henry, and held in the Palace of Westminster, London, which was the largest city in England, and whose continuing loyalty was essential to Montfort's cause.|$|E

5|$|Kecal <b>summons</b> {{the villagers}} {{to witness the}} {{contract}} he has made ("Come inside and listen to me"). He reads the terms: Mařenka is to marry no one but Mícha's son.

The Act ends with Jenik being denounced by Krušina {{and the rest of the}} assembly as a rascal.|$|E
5|$|Keir Starmer, {{director}} of the CPS, announced on 24 May 2011 that a <b>summons</b> for manslaughter had been issued against Harwood. He said the CPS had reviewed its decision not to prosecute because new medical evidence had emerged during the inquest, and because the various medical accounts, including that of the first pathologist, had been tested during questioning. The trial opened on 18 June 2012. Harwood entered a plea of not guilty, and was acquitted on 19 July.|$|E
