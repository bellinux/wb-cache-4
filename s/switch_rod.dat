40|$|Natural {{habitats}} vary in {{available nutrients}} and room for bacteria to grow, but successful colonization {{can lead to}} overcrowding and stress.

40|$|The {{validity}} of the Barten theoretical model for describing the vertebrate spatial contrast sensitivity function (CSF) and acuity at scotopic light levels has been examined. Although this model (which has its basis in signal modulation transfer theory) can successfully describe vertebrate CSF, {{and its relation to}} underlying visual neurophysiology at photopic light levels, significant discrepancies between theory and experimental data have been found at scotopic levels. It is shown that in order to describe scotopic CSF, the theory must be modified to account for important mechanistic changes, which occur as cone vision <b>switches</b> to <b>rod</b> vision. These changes are divided into photon management factors [changes in optical performance (for a dilated pupil), quantum efficiency, receptor sampling] and neural factors (changes in spatial integration area, neural noise, and lateral inhibition in the retina). Predictions of both scotopic CSF and acuity obtained from the modified theory were found to be in good agreement with experimental values obtained from the human, macaque, cat, and owl monkey.

40|$|Of all the {{functions}} that define visual performance, the mesopic luminous efficiency function {{is probably the}} most complex and hardest to standardise or model. Complexities arise because of the substantial and often rapid visual changes that accompany the transition from scotopic to photopic vision. These are caused not only by the <b>switch</b> from <b>rod</b> to cone photoreceptors, but also by switches between different post-receptoral pathways through which the rod and cone signals are transmitted. In this review, we list several of the complexities of mesopic vision, such as rod–cone interactions, rod saturation, mixed photoreceptor spectral sensitivities, different rod and cone retinal distributions, and the changes in the spatial properties of the visual system as it changes from rod- to cone-mediated. Our main focus, however, is the enormous and often neglected temporal changes that occur in the mesopic range and their effect on luminous efficiency. Even before the transition from rod to cone vision is complete, a transition occurs within the rod system itself from a sluggish, sensitive post-receptoral pathway to a faster, less sensitive pathway. As a consequence of these complexities, any measure of mesopic performance will depend not only on the illumination level, but also on the spectral content of the stimuli used to probe performance, their retinal location, their spatial frequency content, and their temporal frequency content. All these should be considered when attempting to derive (or to apply) a luminous efficiency function for mesopic vision...|$|R

Here we show that competing sibling colonies of Paenibacillus dendritiformis bacteria survive overcrowding by switching between two distinct vegetative phenotypes, motile rods and immotile cocci. Growing colonies of the rodshaped bacteria produce a toxic protein, Slf, which kills cells of encroaching sibling colonies. However, sublethal concentrations of Slf induce some of the <b>rods</b> to <b>switch</b> to Slf-resistant cocci, which have distinct metabolic and resistance profiles, including resistance to cell wall antibiotics. Unlike dormant spores of P. dendritiformis, the cocci replicate. If cocci encounter conditions that favor rods, they secrete a signaling molecule that induces a <b>switch</b> to <b>rods.</b> Thus, in contrast to persister cells, P. dendritiformis bacteria adapt to changing environmental conditions by inducible and reversible phenotypic switching. IMPORTANCE In favorable environments, species may face space and nutrient limits due to overcrowding. Bacteria provide an excellent model for analyzing principles underlying overcrowding and regulation of density in nature, since their population dynamics can be easily and accurately assessed under controlled conditions. We describe a newly discovered mechanism for survival of a bacterial population during overcrowding. When competing with sibling colonies, Paenibacillus dendritiformis produces a lethal protein (Slf) that kills cells at the interface of encroaching colonies. Slf also induces {{a small proportion of}} the cells to switch from motile, rod-shaped cells to nonmotile, Slf-resistant, vegetative cocci. When crowding is reduced and nutrients are no longer limiting, the bacteria produce a signal that induces cocci to switch back to motile rods, allowing the population t...|$|R
30|$|Whilst we {{acknowledge}} that mechanical reasons predominantly dictate the rod/strut configurations when building a circular frame, {{the effect of}} rod coupling during CT imaging can be minimised. Firstly, all or all but one rod can be removed during imaging; we see this as the ideal (Fig.  4), as in these cases there is no rod coupling. If {{this is not a}} possibility at that particular time, the second option is to configure the rods in a way that minimises the effect of the rod coupling on the area of interest. It can be appreciated in Fig.  6 {{that in the case of}} a four-rod construct, simply switching the two anterior rods to a more central single one will achieve this goal without particularly jeopardising mechanical strength for a short period. In the case of hexapod frames, whilst temporarily <b>switching</b> struts for <b>rods</b> would also appear to be a good idea, this can be more time-consuming, as often with hexapods the rings are not parallel, and therefore requiring the use of dished (conical) washers or the construction of hinges.|$|R
40|$|Light causesmassive translocationofG-protein {{transducin}} fromthe light-sensitive outer segment compartmentof the rodphotoreceptor cell. Remarkably, significant translocation {{is observed}} {{only when the}} light intensity exceeds a critical threshold level. We addressed {{the nature of this}} thresholdusing a series ofmutantmice and found that the threshold canbe shifted to either a lower orhigher light intensity, dependent on whether the ability of the GTPase-activating complex to inactivate GTP-bound transducin is decreased or increased. We also demonstrated that the threshold is not dependent on cellular signaling downstream from transducin. Finally, we showed that the extent of transducin subunit translocation is affected by the hydrophobicity of its acylmodification. This implies that interactionswith membranes impose a limitation on transducin translocation. Our data suggest that transducin translocation is triggered when the cell exhausts its capacity to activate transducin GTPase, and a portion of transducin remains active for a sufficient time to dissociate from membranes and to escape from the outer segment. Overall, the thresholdmarks the <b>switch</b> of the <b>rod</b> from thehighly light-sensitivemode of operation required under limited lighting conditions to the less-sensitive energy-savingmode beneficial in bright light, when vision is dominated by cones.

40|$|Abstract. The {{electric}} field {{distribution in the}} Gas insulated switchgear (GIS) gas chamber {{is an important factor}} for the design of GIS structure. The {{electric field}} distribution in the GIS gas chamber should be uniform as far as possible, to avoid excessive concentration of the electric field causing the occurrence of flashover and discharge in GIS. The electric field intensity in the gas chamber is higher than its dielectric’s isolating strength when SF 6 /N 2 mixed gas is used as the insulation dielectric of the gas chamber to reduce the consumption of pure SF 6, and the research in this paper aim to solve this problem. Electric-filed numerical analysis and optimal design of GIS gas chamber structure have been done in this paper. The GIS gas chamber 3 D model is built in Solidworks, and finite element analysis of the model is calculated in ANSYS. Electric field numerical calculation for the gas chamber model is calculated based on the theory of electrostatic field. The calculation results show that the electric field intensities of isolated switch, earthing <b>switch</b> and insulation <b>rod</b> are excessive high, and the optimizations for its internal structure are necessarily followed, then calibrating calculations of electric field are carried on the optimized model. The calculating results convey that the electric field intensity in gas chamber decreased significantly, and the maximum value of electric field intensity is lower than the dielectric strength of alternative gas. It means that the alternative gas can meet the insulation requirements for the gas chamber after optimization...|$|R
40|$|Two centuries-old mask traditions {{native to}} Austria and Bavaria enjoy ongoing {{popularity}} {{due to a}} creative mingling {{of old and new}} elements (heavy metal music and fireworks alongside hand-carved wooden masks and birch <b>rod</b> <b>switches).</b> The Krampus is the menacing companion of St. Nikolaus, who visits children on December 5 and 6, although nowadays groups of Krampusse may appear alone. The Perchten, who are associated with the magical female folk-figure Perchta, appear on January 5 and the week before. While the Perchten and Krampusse represent distinct traditions, their history has intersected at various points, and their contemporary manifestations share many elements, including a movement towards a “modern” aesthetic and the employment of such resources as tourist publicity and the internet to promote their appearances, educate the public, and network with each other. While the house visit was formerly the primary setting for these masked figures (or mummers), today it is the public parade. These parades, while rooted in and resembling conventional display-custom performances marked by a static division between performer and spectator, actually consist of a kind of fluid, interactive ritual theater in which the partially improvised, partially scripted performances of masked figures and the responses of spectators shape one another. Contemporary manifestations of Perchten and Krampus traditions will be explored in light of the ongoing cultural dialogue between performers and non-performers who seek to define and interpret the tradition, and the interplay of academic and popular discourses surrounding invented tradition, Folklorismus (folklorism) and Rücklauf (feedback), and the nature of authenticity. Questions of cultural heritage “ownership” surface in the debates over form and meaning, while {{in the hands of the}} Perchten and Krampusse themselves, tradition emerges as an active process and collaborative artwork rather than a fixed commodity with boundaries which can be defined and navigated by outside observers. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{potential}} {{role of the}} neuromodulator dopamine during light adaptation in the mouse retina. The retina is able to process visual stimuli which differ by ten orders of magnitude in intensity. This is achieved by two types of photoreceptors. Very weak stimuli can only be detected by rods (scotopic vision), whereas cones are optimized for daytime (photopic) vision. In the mesopic range both types of photoreceptors are active. Rods and cones converge onto {{the same set of}} ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina. With increasing light intensities rod light responses start to saturate. This saturation is fed into the retinal network at multiple sites, leading to saturated light responses in ganglion cells. Under mesopic conditions, cone light responses might be masked by rod saturation. It has to be elucidated how the retina prevents this saturation during light adaptation. For a couple of decades, there is an ongoing discussion whether dopamine switches the retina from rod to cone-driven vision. Dopamine is released by a single type of amacrine cell in a light-dependent manner. In the present study, I have demonstrated the expression of different types of dopamine receptors in different retinal cell types. Using the patch-clamp-technique, I recorded in vitro light responses from retinal ganglion cells in the intact mouse retina under different states of adaptation. Using single flash stimuli of different intensities, I investigated the sensitivity of the ganglion cells. Application of D 1 dopamine receptor agonists reduced the response amplitude under scotopic and mesopic conditions, similar to the effect of light adaptation on the amplitude of light responses. A second set of experiments used flicker stimuli of different intensities and frequencies. Under scotopic and photopic conditions, flicker responses were well resolved by retinal ganglion cells. In the mesopic range the light intensity was chosen such that rods showed saturated responses. This led to a reduced flicker resolution and to prolonged light responses of ganglion cells, due the fact, that rods started to saturate the whole retinal network. If the major role of dopamine were the <b>switching</b> from <b>rod</b> to cone vision, one would expect that saturation of the light responses is reduced by application of dopamine receptor agonists. In contrast, dopamine agonists lead to an increase in retinal saturation. Moreover, I was able to show that light adaptation in vitro cannot be inhibited pharmacologically by application of D 1 - and D 2 -antagonists. In summary, there is some evidence for dopamine playing a role during light adaptation of the mouse retina. However, it has to be considered that other neuromodulators or messengers are necessary for the transition from scotopic to photopic vision...|$|R
40|$|Flagella, the helical {{propellers}} {{that extend}} from the bacterial cell surface, illustrate how complex nanomachines assemble outside the cell. The sequential {{construction of the}} flagellar rod, hook, and filament requires export of thousands of structural subunits across the cell membrane and this is achieved by a specialised flagellar Type III Secretion System (fT 3 SS) located {{at the base of}} each flagellum. The fT 3 SS imposes a crude ordering of subunits, with filament subunits only exported once the rod and hook are complete. This “export specificity switch” is controlled by the FlhB component of the fT 3 SS export gate in response to a signal from the exported molecular ruler FliK, which monitors the length of the growing hook. This study seeks to clarify how rod and hook subunits interact with FlhB, and how FlhB <b>switches</b> export specificity. <b>Rod</b> and hook subunits possess a conserved gate recognition motif (GRM; Fxxxφ, with φ being any hydrophobic residue) that is proposed to bind a surface-exposed hydrophobic patch on the FlhB cytosolic domain. Mutation of the GRM phenylalanine and the final hydrophobic residue resulted in impaired subunit export and decreased cell motility. Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed to assess whether subunit export order is imposed at FlhB. These experiments showed that rod and hook subunits bind to FlhB with micromolar dissociation constants (5 - 45 μM), suggesting transient interactions. There was no clear correlation between subunit affinity for FlhB and the order of subunit assembly in the nascent flagellum. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy supported prior data showing that rod and hook subunits interact with FlhB’s surface-exposed hydrophobic patch. NMR also indicated that residues away from the patch undergo a conformational change on subunit binding. FlhB autocleaves rapidly in its cytosolic domain, and the resulting polypeptides (FlhBCN and FlhBCC) are held together by non-covalent interactions between b-strands that encompass the autocleavage site. The autocleavage event is a prerequisite for the export specificity switch, but its function is unclear. Analysis of the cellular localization of FlhBCN and FlhBCC revealed that FlhBCC dissociated from the membrane export machinery, but only in the presence of FliK. Biochemical and biophysical studies of FlhB variants that undergo export specificity switching in the absence of FliK showed that these FlhB “autonomous switchers” were less stable than wildtype FlhB and their FlhBCC domain could dissociate from the export machinery in the absence of FliK. The results suggest that the export specificity switch involves a FliK-dependent loss of FlhBCC from the export machinery, eliminating the binding site for rod and hook subunits.
