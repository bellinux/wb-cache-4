5|$|Severe thunderstorms, {{which can}} spawn tornadoes and hailstorms, require wind <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> {{organize}} the storm {{in such a}} way as to maintain the thunderstorm for a longer period of time. This occurs as the storm's inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow. An increasing nocturnal, or overnight, low level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical wind shear through the troposphere. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air and kills the thunderstorm.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast with a closed circulation on August 3. It tracked westward across the tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean and broke into two distinct parts, the northern portion eventually became Hurricane Alberto. The southern portion continued to track westward into the Caribbean Sea, while producing little or no deep convection. The wave reached Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula on August 12, and only then did deep convection redevelop, mostly due to diurnal heating. The wave emerged over the Bay of Campeche early on August 13 as a large area of low pressure. The wave was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five later that day, based on satellite intensity estimates and an observation from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft. Six hours after developing, the depression was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane early on August 16 due to the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and little wind <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> inhibit development.|$|E
5|$|An {{approaching}} trough {{over the}} central United States induced high wind shear over Sandy as it traversed the Bahamas, causing the hurricane to weaken to {{a tropical storm}} while turning more northeastward. The {{southern part of the}} trough detached, causing the <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> decrease late on October28 and allowing Sandy to regain strength. It attained a secondary peak of Category2 strength the following day, and later turned toward the west. During this change in direction, Sandy began to transition into an extratropical cyclone, a process it completed before making landfall near Brigantine, New Jersey, late on October29. The extratropical remnants weakened gradually overland, and the center of circulation was declared indistinguishable over western Pennsylvania two days later. In addition to becoming the largest Atlantic hurricane, Sandy broke records for the lowest pressures ever observed in many cities across the Northeastern United States.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on March24 to the east-southeast of the Marshall Islands. Initially {{it consisted}} of a broad but consolidating circulation, with outflow to the north offsetting moderate wind <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> aid in development. It gradually became better organized, with a curved area of convection wrapping into the center. On March26, the JMA classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression just east of Pohnpei. On March27, the JTWC started tracking the system as a Tropical Depression 04W. Moving west-northwestward, the system's center became more consolidated with convective banding becoming wrapped into it. The JTWC upgraded 04W to a tropical storm the same day, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Maysak.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{continued}} to intensify throughout the afternoon {{as the storm}} became more symmetrical. However, due {{to the location of}} the storm, {{there was a lack of}} accurate wind speed readings, and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity. Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm, the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification. The storm was also heading into an area where shear was forecasted to significantly increase due to an upper-level trough diving southward. Despite convection being partially removed from the center of Josephine, the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized. The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening, causing the wind <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> the west to become stronger.|$|E
5|$|Reconnaissance Aircraft {{and surface}} reports {{confirmed}} {{the existence of}} a circulation. Dean moved northwestward at 22mph (35km/h), {{under the influence of the}} Bermuda High to its northeast. The storm strengthened slightly to reach winds of 60mph (95km/h) later on August 22, though the circulation was exposed on the western edge of the convection due to the storm's quick forward motion and persistent wind shear. Initial forecasts predicted the <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> decrease, allowing Dean to attain hurricane status with winds of over 80mph (130km/h). However, an upper-level trough produced an increase of shear over the storm, and by August 23 Dean weakened to a tropical depression. Hours later, the circulation dissipated, and Dean degenerated into a tropical wave to the east of the Bahamas. Regeneration was considered unlikely at the time.|$|E

5|$|The 1997 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was fairly active, {{due to the}} strong El Niño that was occurring at the time. El Niño causes wind <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> be reduced and water temperatures to increase, resulting in conditions more conductive for tropical cyclones in the East Pacific. There were 24 cyclones in total, including five unnamed tropical depressions. Of these, 19 were in the east Pacific (east of 140°W). Of these, eight peaked at tropical storm intensity, while ten reached hurricane status. Seven of these reached Category3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, including central Pacific cyclones Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka, which became typhoons after crossing into the western Pacific. The first hurricane {{of the year was}} Hurricane Dolores, and the first major hurricane was Hurricane Enrique. Most months during the year had several storms, but no records were set for storms in any particular month.|$|E
5|$|The Intertropical Convergence Zone {{produced}} {{an area of}} convection in the southeastern Arabian Sea {{toward the end of}} October 2011. The overall system moved west-northwestward, developing a distinct low pressure area on October27. By that time, the thunderstorm activity was still disorganized and associated with a weak circulation. Environmental conditions were unfavorable initially, consisting of strong wind shear and dry air. An anticyclone over the system caused the <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> decrease by October28, amid warm water temperatures of , both more favorable conditions. By that time the circulation became well-defined, although still elongated, and the convection was still scattered. On October29, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as Depression ARB 02 about 885km (550mi) east of the Yemeni island of Socotra.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear {{refers to}} the {{variation}} of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 knots (15m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 knots (22m/s) for airliners at flight altitude. Vertical speed changes greater than 4.9knots (2.5m/s) also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft. Low level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during {{take off and landing}} in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear (headwind loss in excess of 30 knots). The rationale for this additional caution includes: (1) microburst intensity can double in a minute or less, (2) the winds can shift to excessive cross wind, (3) 40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and (4) several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts. Wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear.|$|E

5|$|Despite the storm's {{intensification}} and well-organized satellite appearance, {{the circulation}} failed {{to become better}} defined. In their first discussion on Iris, the NHC mentioned {{the potential for the}} system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed. One forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> its south. Although its overall appearance did not change significantly, the Hurricane Hunters reported a closed eye with a diameter 23mi (37km) and a stadium effect (eyewall curvature) on October6. Later that day, Iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the Dominican Republic, and the NHC remarked that land interaction with the Greater Antilles was the only factor impeding further development. After Iris reached winds of 85mph (140km/h) early on October7, its intensity remained steady for about 24hours. During that time, the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted, possibly due to an upper-level low. By late on October7, the area of hurricaneforce winds associated with Iris extended only 25mi (35km) from its 16mi (22km) wide eye.|$|E

25|$|At 0600UTC on September7, the {{depression}} had intensified into Tropical Storm Hortense. A reconnaissance flight {{around that time}} reported winds of , confirming the storm was strengthening. Early on September8, Hortense struck Guadeloupe with winds of 60mph (95km/h). Shortly thereafter, intensification slowed, due to increased vertical wind shear by upper-level short wave in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Convection diminished, with satellite imagery showing a tropical cyclone with the low-level circulation exposed. The short-wave soon left the area, causing wind <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> decrease and convection quickly re-developed.|$|E

The hardest-hit area was in the Ozarks, around Springfield, Missouri, where nearly continuous supercells developed throughout the evening, resulting in numerous tornado touchdowns. In addition to the tornadoes, hail larger than baseballs and damaging straight-line downburst winds as strong as 100mph (160km/h) were reported.

500|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Gladys {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave [...] a trough embedded in the trade winds [...] that moved across the Lesser Antilles on October6. For the next few days, the wave moved across the Caribbean Sea without any development. As the wave interacted with the intertropical convergence zone, a large area of convection persisted across the region, spawning a series of low pressure areas. One became a tropical depression near Swan Island offshore Honduras on October11, and two days later another tropical depression formed near San Andrés island in the extreme southwestern Caribbean. The latter system, which would eventually become Gladys, moved slowly north-northwestward. An anticyclone in the region caused wind <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> decrease, allowing for gradual development. On October15, a Hurricane Hunters flight observed winds of on that basis, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gladys.|$|E
500|$|On September1, a {{tropical}} wave exited {{the west coast}} of Africa and quickly showed signs of organization. It possessed a low pressure area and some convection as the system moved generally westward. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first pinpointed the system as an area for potential development late on September2 while it was about [...] west-southwest of Cape Verde. However, an upper-level trough associated with the developing Hurricane Florence to its west increased wind shear across the region, which prevented significant tropical cyclone development over the next week. However, on September5, the NHC noted the potential for the storm system to organize into {{a tropical}} depression within the next several days, but its close proximity to Florence continued to stall its strengthening. By September9, the trough moved far enough away from the system to allow wind <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> relent, signalling an increase in convective thunderstorm activity. At around 1800UTC that day, the system developed into a tropical depression about [...] east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
500|$|Soon after Damien-Birenda {{exited the}} Australian region, another {{tropical}} disturbance formed {{north of the}} Cocos on January29, which was initially weak but gradually organized. The disturbance tracked quickly west-westward due to a powerful ridge to the south, remaining in tandem with Tropical Storm Birenda about [...] to the east. On January31, the system crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean. The fast forward motion caused the effects of wind <b>shear</b> <b>to</b> diminish as well as increase the circulation's strength, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chikita on January31. At that time, the storm attained its peak intensity of 65km/h (40mph). Almost immediately thereafter, the convection began weakening due to lukewarm water temperatures, and Chikita weakened to tropical depression status on February1. Continuing rapidly to the west, the circulation became exposed from the convection on February3 due to increased wind shear. Around that time, Chikita passed about [...] north of Rodrigues island, and shortly thereafter weakened into a tropical disturbance. On the next day, the circulation passed north of both Mauritius and Réunion, presenting an asymmetric structure with the strongest winds to the south. Chikita dissipated on February5 off the southeast coast of Madagascar.|$|E
