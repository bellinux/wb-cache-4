5|$|Yttrium has {{at least}} 20 {{metastable}} ("excited") isomers ranging in mass number from 78 to 102. Multiple excitation <b>states</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> observed for 80Y and 97Y.

5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United <b>States</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United <b>States</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E

5|$|Nearly 4,000 {{species of}} fungi, {{including}} lichen-forming {{species have been}} recorded from Malaysia. Of the two fungal groups with {{the largest number of}} species in Malaysia, the Ascomycota and their asexual <b>states</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> surveyed in some habitats (decaying wood, marine and freshwater ecosystems, as parasites of some plants, and as agents of biodegradation), but have not been or have been only poorly surveyed in other habitats (as endobionts, in soils, on dung, as human and animal pathogens); the Basidiomycota are only partly surveyed: bracket fungi, and mushrooms and toadstools have been studied, but Malaysian rust and smut fungi remain very poorly known. Without doubt, many more fungal species in Malaysia have not yet been recorded, and it is likely that many of those, when found, will be new to science.|$|E

Two other countries have won five medals: Australia (all women's) and Brazil (three men's, two women's). As of the 2016 Summer Olympics, 90 medals (30 of each color) have been awarded to teams from 20 National Olympic Committees.|$|E
5|$|Americium readily {{reacts with}} oxygen and dissolves well in acids. The most common {{oxidation}} state for americium is +3, in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride, oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other oxidation <b>states</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> observed between +2 and +7, {{which is the}} widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am4+ (yellow-reddish), AmV; (yellow), AmVI (brown) and AmVII (dark green). All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992nm.|$|E

5|$|Deinosuchus {{was present}} {{on both sides}} of the Western Interior Seaway. Specimens have been {{described}} from 10 U.S. states: Utah, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and North Carolina. David Schwimmer has said Deinosuchus fossils have been found in South Carolina and Delaware as well, but none of them from those two <b>states</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> formally described. A Deinosuchus osteoderm from the San Carlos Formation was also reported in 2006, so the giant crocodilian's range may have included parts of northern Mexico. Deinosuchus fossils are most abundant in the Gulf Coastal Plain region of Georgia, near the Alabama border. All known specimens of Deinosuchus were found in rocks dated to the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. The oldest examples of this genus lived approximately 82 Ma, and the youngest lived around 73Ma.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} to achieve {{geographic}} balance, nineteen states have never produced a Supreme Court Justice. Some <b>states</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> over-represented (although partly because there were fewer states from which early justices could be appointed), with New York producing fifteen justices, Ohio producing ten, Massachusetts nine, Virginia eight, six each from Pennsylvania and Tennessee, and five from Kentucky, Maryland, and New Jersey. A handful of justices were born outside the United States, mostly from among the earliest justices on the Court. These included James Wilson, born in Fife, Scotland; James Iredell, born in Lewes, England; and William Paterson, born in County Antrim, Ireland. Justice David Josiah Brewer was born farthest from the U.S., in Smyrna, in the Ottoman Empire, (now İzmir, Turkey). George Sutherland was born in Buckinghamshire, England. The last foreign-born Justice, {{and the only one}} of these for whom English was a second language, was Felix Frankfurter, born in Vienna, Austria.

5|$|Flag-of-convenience {{registries}} are criticized, {{mostly by}} trade union organizations based in developed countries, {{especially those of}} Europe.

Seafarers from developed countries must make themselves competitive if they wish to take advantage and practice in a global environment. , thirteen flag <b>states</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found by international shipping organizations to have substandard regulations. A basis for many criticisms is that the flag-of-convenience system allows shipowners to be legally anonymous and difficult to prosecute in civil and criminal actions. Some ships with flags of convenience have been found engaging in crime, offer substandard working conditions, and negatively impact the environment, primarily through illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. , ships of thirteen flags of convenience are targeted for special enforcement by countries that they visit. Supporters of the practice, however, point to economic and regulatory advantages, and increased freedom in choosing employees from an international labor pool.|$|E

5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} {{is the primary}} host of the Bayou virus (BAYV), the second-most common agent of {{hantavirus}} infections in the United States. About 16% of animals are infected and the virus is most prevalent in old, heavy males. The virus may be transmitted among rice rats through bites inflicted during fights. It is also present in rice rat saliva and urine, and human infections may occur because of contact with these excreta. Two related hantaviruses, Catacama virus and Playa de Oro virus, are known from Oryzomys couesi in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively. An arenavirus normally associated with woodrats (Neotoma) has also been found in Florida marsh rice rats. Antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in the United <b>States,</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found in marsh rice rats in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee.
