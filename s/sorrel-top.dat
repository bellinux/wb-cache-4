60|$|<b>Sorrel-top</b> Simpson, a year {{younger than}} his brother, {{proved to be a}} most unfair fighter, and the good-natured fireman was {{compelled}} to interfere several times before the second of the Simpson clan lay on the ground and acknowledged defeat.|$|E
6000|$|Marcia did {{not answer}} at once, and then she said, with the vagueness of one not greatly {{interested}} by the subject, [...] "You've got a <b>sorrel-top</b> in your office that's fiery enough, if she's anything like what {{she used to be}} when she went to school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{said the}} Indian, {{in a low}} sweet tone,--"why does the Pale Face still follow the track of the Red Man? Why does he pursue him, even as O-kee chow, the wild cat, chases Ka-ka, the skunk? Why are the feet of <b>Sorrel-top,</b> the white chief, among the acorns of Muck-a-Muck, the {{mountain}} forest? Why," [...] he repeated, quietly but firmly abstracting a silver spoon from the table,--"why do you seek to drive him from the wigwams of his fathers? His brothers are already gone to the happy hunting-grounds. Will the Pale Face seek him there?" [...] And, averting his face from the Judge, he hastily slipped a silver cake-basket beneath his blanket, to conceal his emotion.|$|E
6000|$|How often my {{wife was}} at me about that {{projected}} grand entrance-hall of hers, {{which was to be}} knocked clean through the chimney, {{from one end of the}} house to the other, and astonish all guests by its generous amplitude. [...] "But, wife," [...] said I, [...] "the chimney--consider the chimney: if you demolish the foundation, what is to support the superstructure?" [...] "Oh, that will rest on the second floor." [...] The truth is, women know next to nothing about the realities of architecture. However, my wife still talked of running her entries and partitions. She spent many long nights elaborating her plans; in imagination building her boasted hall through the chimney, as though its high mightiness were a mere spear of <b>sorrel-top.</b> At last, I gently reminded her that, little as she might fancy it, the chimney was a fact--a sober, substantial fact, which, in all her plannings, it would be well to take into full consideration. But this was not of much avail.|$|E
