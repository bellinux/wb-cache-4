2500|$|AT Mobility v. Concepcion, , is a {{legal dispute}} that was decided by the United States Supreme Court. [...] On April 27, 2011, the Court ruled, by a 5–4 margin, that the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925 preempts state laws that {{prohibit}} contracts from disallowing class-wide arbitration, such as the law previously upheld by the California Supreme Court {{in the case of}} Discover Bank v. Superior Court. [...] As a result, businesses that include arbitration agreements with class action waivers can require consumers to bring claims only in individual arbitrations, rather than in court as part of a class action. [...] The decision was described by Jean <b>Sternlight</b> as a [...] "tsunami that is wiping out existing and potential consumer and employment class actions" [...] and by law professor Myriam Gilles as [...] "the real game-changer for class action litigation". [...] By April 2012, Concepcion was cited in at least 76 decisions sending putative class actions to individual arbitration. [...] After the decision, several major businesses introduced or changed arbitration terms in their consumer contracts (some of which were based on the consumer-friendly terms found in the AT Mobility agreement), although the hypothesis of massive adoption of consumer arbitration clauses following the decision has been disputed.|$|E
2500|$|The Concepcion {{decision}} also impacted {{the usage}} of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts, including {{the usage of}} [...] "consumer-friendly" [...] arbitration terms like the ones in AT's agreement. [...] Jean <b>Sternlight</b> said that the Concepcion decision would cause businesses to include arbitration clauses with class action waivers, saying that the Concepcion decision removed the possibility of [...] "costly litigation" [...] over whether such terms are enforceable. [...] In a 2012 research paper, Gilles wrote that the majority opinion in Concepcion led to a [...] "race to the top" [...] in implementing arbitration procedures that are more friendly to consumer claims {{and more likely to}} allow their vindication. [...] Gilles wrote that corporate lawyers encouraged companies to implement terms similar to the ones used by AT Mobility and upheld in Concepcion. [...] According to Gilles, many large consumer-oriented businesses changed their arbitration provisions in 2011 and 2012. [...] However, Gilles noted that only 6 out of the 37 companies she examined had arbitration clauses that [...] "offered anything close to AT's set of incentives, and none were quite as generous". [...] Ann Marie Tracey and Shelley McGill wrote that businesses would introduce more consumer-unfriendly terms in their arbitration clauses since unconscionability [...] "provided strong motivation for business to draft agreements fairly in the pre-Concepcion environment; that motivation does not exist in the post-Concepcion era." [...] Suzanna Sherry said that the broad holding of the decision would make harsh arbitration clauses, similar to the earliest consumer arbitration clauses, enforceable, since the unconscionability doctrine that had been used to strike down those harsh clauses could be found preempted based on Concepcion.|$|E

Jean <b>Sternlight</b> wrote in a 2012 article that, according to JAMS Executive Vice President Jay Welsh, JAMS handles a [...] "few hundred" [...] consumer cases each year, most of which are preemptive arbitrations by alleged credit card debtors seeking to avoid debt collection litigation, and that AAA conducted about a thousand consumer arbitrations a year. <b>Sternlight</b> said that this was {{a very small number of}} arbitrations compared to the number of consumers required to arbitrate disputes. According to the preliminary results of the CFPB's arbitration study, 1,241 cases were filed with the AAA from 2010 to 2012 concerning [...] "credit cards, checking accounts, and payday loans", compared to an estimated 80 million credit card holders subject to arbitration clauses. Of the 326 AAA cases where a debt was not in dispute, consumers pursued claims for $1,000 or less in arbitration only 23 times. According to The New York Timess analysis of data from multiple arbitration firms, from 2010 through 2014, there were 505 arbitration cases where a consumer brought a dispute for no more than $2,500. [...] In June 2017, AT&T stated that 412 arbitration cases had been filed against it since the beginning of 2015.|$|E

In 1849 the U.S. Congress extended the light requirements to sailing vessels.In 1889 the United States convened the first International Maritime Conference to consider regulations for preventing collisions. The resulting Washington Conference Rules were adopted by the U.S in 1890 and became effective internationally in 1897. Within these rules was the requirement for steamships to carry a second mast head light.The international 1948 Safety of Life at Sea Conference recommended a mandatory second masthead light solely for power driven vessels over 150 feet in length and a fixed <b>sternlight</b> for almost all vessels.

5000|$|Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) has {{introduced}} bills modifying the Federal Arbitration Act, all substantially the same. The bill was titled the [...] "Fair Arbitration Act" [...] in 2007 and 2011; it was previously introduced in 2000 (under the title [...] "Consumer and Employee Arbitration Bill of Rights") and 2002 (under the title [...] "Arbitration Fairness Act"). The Fair Arbitration Act would impose standards on arbitration proceedings {{based on the}} AAA Consumer Due Process Protocol. The 2007 {{version of the bill}} (S. 1135 in the 110th Congress) would impose a number of regulations on arbitration agreements in general, including regulating how conspicuous arbitration agreements are, requiring arbitration to be conducted by [...] "an independent, neutral alternative dispute resolution organization", and mandating that [...] "each party shall have a vote in the selection of the arbitrator", who would be required to meet certain qualifications and provide broad neutrality disclosures. The 2007 bill would also regulate the arbitration process itself by setting time limits on the process, requiring application of the law of the state where the nondrafting party of the agreement resides, and demanding that the arbitrator grant [...] "relevant and necessary prehearing depositions". The 2007 bill would also require arbitration agreements to allow either party to pursue an action in small claims court instead of arbitration. According to Stipanowich, the bill was opposed by [...] "commercial clients and practitioners" [...] who saw the bill as making it difficult for the parties to adapt the arbitration process. Jean <b>Sternlight</b> criticized that the Fair Arbitration Act would only outlaw specific unfair practices and businesses could therefore devise and implement new unfair arbitration practices not covered by the Fair Arbitration Act. According to <b>Sternlight,</b> consumer and employee advocacy groups opposed the Fair Arbitration Act because it would legitimize pre-dispute agreements to arbitrate consumer and employee disputes. Sam Luttrell criticized the Fair Arbitration Act's neutrality requirements, saying they would prevent familiar arbitrators with expertise, who do not meet the neutrality requirements of the Fair Arbitration Act, from presiding over commercial arbitrations. According to Thomas V. Burch, the Fair Arbitration Act [...] "received little, if any, widespread support": none of the 2000, 2002, or 2007 versions had cosponsors.|$|E

5000|$|Matt Webb, Senior Vice President of the United States Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform, {{stated that}} a fair {{arbitration}} clause could allow consumers to effectively pursue small claims without attorney representation. [...] Jason Scott Johnston and Todd Zywicki described consumer arbitration as [...] "a process set up so that hiring an attorney offers little value to a consumer and is often unnecessary" [...] {{and said that the}} CFPB's arbitration study's results were consistent with this hypothesis. Travis Crabtree said unrepresented consumers are [...] "less likely to be tripped up in a procedural trap" [...] in arbitration than in litigation. [...] Michael Satz, though, wrote that the rules of procedure established by arbitration administrators {{are not likely to be}} understood by nonlawyers. Stephan Landsman wrote that, under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, arbitrators are prohibited from assisting unrepresented parties in arbitration, in contrast to judges who are allowed and encouraged to assist unrepresented parties in court.Jean <b>Sternlight</b> said that consumers cannot effectively present what she termed [...] "procedurally difficult" [...] claims in individual arbitration Aaron Blumenthal wrote that, since simpler claims are likely to be resolved by customer service, claims brought in arbitration are more likely to be procedurally difficult claims requiring an attorney to present.|$|E
5000|$|The AAA {{requires}} {{businesses with}} consumer arbitration clauses {{inconsistent with the}} Consumer Due Process Protocol to waive the offending provisions for all disputes or remove the AAA from their clause. [...] Christopher R. Drahozal and Samantha Zyontz wrote that, {{in a sample of}} 299 cases before the AAA in which an award was issued between April and December 2007, 76.6% of the cases had arbitration agreements that fully complied with the Consumer Due Process Protocol, and only five cases were conducted despite [...] "unwaived protocol violations." [...] In addition, over 150 businesses modified their arbitration clauses in response to a request by the AAA to conform to the Consumer Due Process Protocol. [...] Michael L. Rustad, Richard Buckingham, Diane D'Angelo, and Katherine Durlacher stated that numerous social networking websites had arbitration agreements that violated the AAA Consumer Due Process Protocol. The authors determined that many of the clauses did not adequately inform users about the existence of an arbitration agreement or the consequences of agreeing to arbitration. The standards of the Consumer Due Process Protocol have been cited by courts resolving disputes over the enforceability of arbitration agreements. In 2003, Reginald Alleyne wrote that courts tended to enforce arbitration agreements if they complied with [...] "minimum 'due process' standards". Jean <b>Sternlight,</b> though, wrote that courts have rarely referenced consumer arbitration standards, and when they do, it is to defeat a challenge that an arbitration clause is unfair.|$|E
50|$|According to a 2009 {{report by}} the Searle Civil Justice Institute, {{in a sample of}} 301 {{consumer}} cases where the AAA issued an award from April to December 2007, consumers were represented by counsel in 151 cases (50.2%). In arbitration, consumers represented by counsel generally won some relief and won a higher average amount than consumers appearing pro se. According to the Searle Civil Justice Institute, this difference could be either due to the enhanced advocacy of an attorney or due to attorneys screening cases for ones that are likely to succeed. According to the preliminary results of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's arbitration study, which examined consumer financial services cases from 2010 through 2012 filed with the American Arbitration Association, in the 522 debt collection cases studied, consumers were represented in 220 cases (42.1%) and businesses were represented in 518 cases (99.2%). In the 719 non-debt collection cases, consumers were represented in 435 cases (60.5%) and businesses were represented in 637 cases (88.6%). The CFPB stated that the high proportion of cases where a business is represented by an attorney may be due to state laws regarding the unauthorized practice of law, which prohibit corporations from self-representing in arbitration. Jean <b>Sternlight</b> wrote that in mandatory arbitration, one side may be represented while the other side is not, which may pressure both parties to retain an attorney to avoid the situation where only the opposing party is represented. Kristen M. Blankley described the possibility that businesses could subsidize counsel for a consumer party who would otherwise proceed without representation.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{commentators}} have raised {{concerns over the}} limitations of private self-regulation by arbitration forums {{in the form of}} consumer standards. In 2004, Mark E. Budnitz expressed concern that businesses can circumvent consumer protection policies of arbitration organizations by naming alternative arbitration administrators. [...] In 2007, Martin H. Malin wrote in the context of pre-dispute employment arbitration agreements that the concern that [...] "rogue arbitration agencies" [...] could [...] "place competitive pressure on AAA and JAMS to deviate from their rules and policies" [...] was [...] "not a widespread problem," [...] in part due to the reputations of AAA and JAMS. Although Malin in 2012 commended the AAA and JAMS employment protocols as positive examples of self-regulation, he criticized the decision of the New York Court of Appeals in Brady v. Williams Capital Group (2010), which held that the American Arbitration Association's rules requiring the employer to pay all the arbitrator's fees could not override an express contractual provision requiring the arbitrator's fees to be split equally. Malin criticized Brady for allowing businesses to circumvent such protocols by stating that the arbitration provider's rules would only apply [...] "except as provided in" [...] the arbitration agreement. Jeffrey W. Stempel wrote that courts have refused to consider consumer protection policies as part of arbitration agreements even when the named administrator requires compliance with those policies as a condition of administering an arbitration. J. Watson Hamilton and Jean <b>Sternlight</b> wrote that consumers have no recourse if an arbitration organization or an arbitrator chooses not to follow its own consumer standards.|$|E
5000|$|Commentators {{have viewed}} {{the ability to}} prevent {{consumers}} from obtaining relief on a classwide basis as a principal reason for businesses to add arbitration provisions to their consumer contracts. Lisa Renee Pomerantz wrote that there was speculation that large businesses would abandon arbitration if pre-dispute class action waivers could not be enforced because they believe arbitration is [...] "more readily accessible to and provides greater protections to consumers". [...] Jeff [...] said that the financial industry's argument that the CFPB's proposed ban on class action waivers {{would lead to the}} industry abandoning arbitration suggested that its [...] "love of arbitration is about barring class actions". [...] F. Paul Bland and Claire Prestel wrote that, for businesses, a class action waiver is [...] "the most valuable provision in an arbitration clause". Nancy Welsh described the Supreme Court's arbitration jurisprudence as giving businesses the benefit of blocking class actions as an incentive to [...] "provide and fund a national private small claims court". In a 2013 article giving advice to businesses on drafting arbitration clauses, Nicole F. Munro and Peter L. Cockrell wrote, [...] "The class action waiver is the focal point of any arbitration clause. Without a class action waiver, one need not engage in arbitration." [...] Rutledge and Drahozal wrote that although nearly all credit card contracts contain class action waivers, very few contain other provisions identified as unfair to the consumer, which they concluded is due to businesses wanting to avoid a ruling that the class action waiver, together with those other unfair provisions, is unenforceable. Jean <b>Sternlight</b> said that if an arbitration clause contains a class action waiver, any other terms are irrelevant, as no consumers will actually pursue individual arbitration.|$|E
