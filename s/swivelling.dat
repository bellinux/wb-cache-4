5|$|A {{variant of}} the {{extended}} version used in desert border patrol makes use of a high-ceilinged canopy to allow a <b>swivelling</b> rear-facing heavy machine-gun mount, while the canopy can be extended to provide a mobile command post. An air conditioned hardtop version of the extended model is often used by officers, and a version developed for riot control has clear polycarbonate shielding along the rear sides and roof, as well as gunports for less-lethal weapons. The shielding allows for a wide field of view {{while at the same}} time protecting against firebombs and rock-throwing.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{development}} of the P.1127 Hawker and Bristol had also undertaken considerable development work on a supersonic version, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, to meet a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) requirement issued for such an aircraft. The design used a single Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine with four <b>swivelling</b> nozzles, in a fashion similar to the P.1127, and required the use of plenum chamber burning (PCB) to achieve supersonic speeds. The P.1154 won the competition to meet the requirement against strong competition from other aircraft manufacturers such as Dassault Aviation's Mirage IIIV. The French government did not accept the decision and withdrew; the NATO requirement was cancelled shortly after in 1965.|$|E

Some games {{attempted to}} incorporate elements of first person shooter or survival horror games {{through the use of}} less restricted character movement and exploration, with varying degrees of success. Others, however, unashamedly paid homage to 1990s arcade gameplay, even embracing a somewhat parodic style. Light guns are not compatible with modern high-definition televisions, leading developers to experiment with hybrid controllers, particularly with the Wii Remote for the Wii, as well as the PlayStation 3's GunCon 3 peripheral used with Time Crisis 4. Others have used the PlayStation Move motion control system.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, on 13April1961, HSA {{decided to}} conduct {{preliminary}} {{work on a}} supersonic derivative of the P.1127 {{under the guidance of}} Ralph Hooper. This would result in a new design, designated P.1150, which was 50% larger than the preceding P.1127; it was proposed that a new performance enhancing feature be adopted {{in the form of the}} plenum chamber burning (PCB)– essentially an afterburner – in the engine. The P.1150 proposal broadly resembled its P.1127 predecessor despite major changes being made, including its revised fuselage, the adoption of a thinner wing, and an advanced version of the Pegasus engine. The Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine was equipped with a similar arrangement of four <b>swivelling</b> exhaust nozzles, the front nozzles of which were to be equipped with PCB. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the P.1150 was to have been capable of Mach 1.3.|$|E
5|$|In Akagi predecessor, Hōshō, the hot {{exhaust gases}} vented by <b>swivelling</b> funnels posed {{a danger to}} the ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not {{suggested}} any solutions. Akagi and Kaga were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. Akagi was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the smaller one exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gases to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. Kaga adopted a version of this configuration when she was modernized during the mid-1930s.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the large}} number of these medals that were awarded during the long reign of Queen Victoria, new dies had to be cut from time to time, which {{resulted}} in differences in appearance. In 1855 a Victoria version of the medal with new <b>swivelling</b> scroll suspender began to be produced. The suspender was affixed to the medal by means of a double-toe claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal.|$|E
25|$|In 1916 a new ribbon {{began to}} be used for the medal, as {{published}} in Army Order 183 of June 1916, to distinguish it from the ribbon of the Victoria Cross. It was still crimson, but edged with 3 millimetres wide white bands. In 1920 the <b>swivelling</b> scroll suspender was altered to a fixed non-swivelling type. The means of attachment to the medal remained a single-toe claw and a pin through the medal's upper edge.|$|E

The first {{aircraft}} built was a Wright pusher biplane in 1907, unusual for the time it had a <b>swivelling</b> tail wheel. A series of Wright pusher triplanes were built between 1908 and 1914 {{for a number of}} notable aviators. In 1911 they built a number of Hall-Scott pusher biplanes for Thomas Baldwin, known as the Baldwin Red Devil for the red-doped covering. Between 1913 and 1914 they built several Curtis-type biplanes.|$|E
25|$|The hunting {{behaviour}} of the Salticidae is confusingly varied {{compared to}} that of most spiders in other families. Salticids hunt diurnally as a rule, which is consistent with their highly developed visual system. When it detects potential prey, a jumping spider typically begins orienting itself by <b>swivelling</b> its cephalothorax to bring the anterior median eyes to bear. It then moves its abdomen into line with its cephalothorax. After that, it might spend some time inspecting the object of its attention and determining whether a camouflaged or doubtful item of prey is promising, before it starts to stalk slowly forward. When close enough, the spider pauses to attach a dragline, then springs onto the prey.|$|E
25|$|The third {{prototype}} to fly, {{serial number}} B9965, had modified wings, {{with a wider}} centre-section and a smaller cutout for the pilot, while the fuselage had a fully circular section, rather than the slab-sided {{one of the first}} two aircraft, and the tail was smaller. It was officially tested in December 1917, reaching a speed of 119mph (192km/h), and was then rebuilt with longer-span (30ft (9.14 m)) two-bay wings (compared with the 25ft 9in (7.85 m) single bay wings). This allowed the Snipe to compete for Air Board Specification A.1(a) for a high-altitude single-seat fighter. This specification required a speed of at least 135mph (225km/h) at 15,000ft (4,573 m) and a ceiling of at least 25,000ft (7,620 m) while carrying an armament of two fixed and one <b>swivelling</b> machine gun. An oxygen supply and heated clothing were to be provided for the pilot to aid operation at high altitude.|$|E
25|$|Minifigures {{generally}} feature six parts (widely {{referred to}} as tools in the toy industry): head, torso, hips, arms, hands, and legs; these six parts allow seven points of articulation: <b>swivel</b> head, <b>swivel</b> arms, <b>swivel</b> wrists, and <b>swivel</b> legs. Minifigures are usually packaged as three separate parts in Lego sets: head, torso and legs. The plastic is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a tough material that makes LEGO figures durable.|$|R

5000|$|A fishing <b>swivel</b> {{is a small}} device {{consisting}} of two rings connected to a pivoting joint. The device is usually made of metal, and the pivoting joint is usually ball- or barrel-shaped. The line from a rod and reel is tied to one end, and a length of fishing line, often terminated by a hook, lure or sinker, {{is tied to the}} other. The main purpose of the <b>swivel</b> is to allow the line to untwist during line retrieval, preventing undesirable tangling. This is particularly important for users of monofilament test line. A secondary benefit of the fishing <b>swivel</b> is that it may stop a sliding sinker, which depending on fishing method may be placed before or after the <b>swivel.</b> Snap <b>swivels</b> have a safety-pin like clip linked to one of the rings. Lures may be affixed directly to the snap. The presence of the <b>swivel</b> has been said to detract from the effectiveness of some types of lures. Depending on the position of the lure, the hooks can become entangled in various ways with the <b>swivel.</b> It is also noted that <b>swivels</b> can serve as weak points in the line, and therefore lessen the likelihood of landing larger or harder fighting fish. Three-way <b>swivels</b> provide a point of connection for an additional lure or length of line, and are essential for certain line and hook setups. Fishing <b>swivels</b> come in sizes ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters, and are traditionally either flat black or brass in color. More modern <b>swivels</b> can be obtained in lustrous red and blue varieties. It is somewhat possible that the <b>swivel</b> color plays a role in attracting fish, especially in low light conditions.|$|R
