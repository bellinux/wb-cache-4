5|$|In 1948, the Legislature placed all state-funded higher {{education}} {{into the new}} State University of New York (SUNY). Cornell's four <b>statutory</b> colleges (agriculture, human ecology, labor relations and veterinary medicine) have been affiliated with SUNY since its inception, but {{did not have any}} such state affiliation prior to that time. <b>Statutory</b> college employees legally are employees of Cornell, not employees of SUNY. The State Education Law gives the SUNY Board of Trustees the authority to approve Cornell's appointment of the deans/unit heads of the <b>statutory</b> colleges, and control of the level of state funding for the <b>statutory</b> colleges.|$|E

5|$|A {{ministry}} is usually {{composed of a}} headquarters {{and a number of}} departments, boards or other subordinate entities, and <b>statutory</b> boards. For instance, as of May 2007 the Ministry of Law had three departments (the Chief Information Officer's Office, Insolvency and Public Trustee's Office and Legal Aid Bureau), three boards and tribunals (the Appeals Board for Land Acquisitions, Copyright Tribunal and Land Surveyors Board), and two <b>statutory</b> boards (the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore and Singapore Land Authority).|$|E
5|$|A <b>statutory</b> {{board is}} an {{autonomous}} {{agency of the}} Government that is established by an Act of Parliament and overseen by a government ministry. The Act sets out the purposes, powers and rights of the agency. Unlike ministries and government departments that are subdivisions of ministries, <b>statutory</b> boards may not be staffed by civil servants and have greater independence and flexibility in their operations. They are managed by boards of directors whose members usually include businessmen, professionals, senior civil servants and officials of trade unions. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF), the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the National Heritage Board (NHB), and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) are all <b>statutory</b> boards.|$|E

5|$|Arguments {{about the}} {{taxability}} of compensation for personal services, whether called wages, salary, {{or some other}} term, may be either constitutional arguments as in United States v. Connor (see below) or <b>statutory</b> arguments as in Cheek v. United States, depending {{on the details of}} the argument. For purposes of presentation, these arguments are summarized here rather than in the article Tax protester <b>statutory</b> arguments. The rest of this section explains these arguments in more detail.|$|E
5|$|As simple {{ultra vires}} {{concerns}} the exact powers conferred upon government ministers and <b>statutory</b> bodies, <b>statutory</b> interpretation {{is arguably the}} most important exercise the courts need to engage in to determine the scope of powers laid out in the statute. Hence, the cases decided are fact-specific and depend upon each court's interpretation of the relevant statute, making success of the judicial review somewhat unpredictable. The UK case of Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), illustrates this concept. The defendant was a <b>statutory</b> body establishing washhouses and baths for residents who could not afford their own washing facilities. When it subsequently established a laundry service, the defendant was declared to have acted ultra vires since its <b>statutory</b> purpose was not to carry on a business. Even though the business was carried out at a substantial loss, the statute in question did not give the defendant such a power to do so. Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.|$|E
5|$|Brennan then {{noted that}} the {{principles}} of <b>statutory</b> construction as regards to Indians were very specific. Any differences in possible interpretation must be resolved {{in favor of the}} tribe or the Indian. Since Minnesota's interpretation did not meet any of these tests regarding either the consent of Congress to tax or of <b>statutory</b> construction, Brennan stated that the Supreme Court would not follow the state's reasoning, and reversed the lower court's decision.|$|E

5|$|In 1971 a {{proposal}} {{was made by}} the Lundy Field Society to establish a marine reserve, and the survey was led by Dr Keith Hiscock, supported by a team of students from Bangor University. Provision for the establishment of <b>statutory</b> Marine Nature Reserves was included in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and on 21 November 1986 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced the designation of a <b>statutory</b> reserve at Lundy.|$|E

Astley's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is Electricity North West Ltd.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of {{the natural}} {{environment}} is well developed in the United Kingdom. There are various public sector organisations with {{an important role in}} the stewardship of the country's flora. Scottish Natural Heritage is the <b>statutory</b> body responsible for natural heritage management in Scotland. One of their duties is to establish National Nature Reserves. Until 2004 there were 73, but a review carried out in that year resulted in a significant number of sites losing their NNR status, and as of 2006 there are 55. The Forestry Commission in Scotland serves as the forestry department of the Scottish Government and is one of the country's largest landowners. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee is the <b>statutory</b> adviser to Government on UK and international nature conservation.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{influenced}} by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, {{since the late}} 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on {{a draft of the}} German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in effect with post–World War II modifications. <b>Statutory</b> law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts. The main body of Japanese <b>statutory</b> law is called the Six Codes.|$|E
5|$|In {{academic}} {{circles the}} case is generally seen {{as an example of}} the court taking two different approaches to <b>statutory</b> interpretation, with the legalistic approach of the majority judges in contrast with the purposive approach of the minority judges.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{also changed}} the {{extradition}} policy, allowing extradition for people prosecuted abroad and not facing charges in Argentina. He also supported the requests by {{human rights organizations}} to turn the former detention centers into memorials for the disappeared. Argentina became a signatory of the UN Convention on the Non-Applicability of <b>Statutory</b> Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity in 2003. A creative interpretation of the convention by the courts allowed them to circumvent the <b>statutory</b> limitations to crimes committed decades in the past, and also the ex post facto applicability of laws that were not in force {{at the time of}} the crimes.|$|E

5|$|Similar to the United Kingdom's position, {{judicial}} review in Singapore {{is confined to}} matters of public law, and the applicable tests are the source test and nature test. The Datafin decision was applied by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Public Service Commission v. Lai Swee Lin Linda (2001), where the respondent, an employee with the Land Office, had the probationary period of her employment extended without prior warning. Her employment contract was later terminated. She complained to various <b>statutory</b> bodies, and ultimately to the Public Service Commission ("PSC"), but was unsuccessful in having her employment reinstated. She then sought leave from the High Court to apply for {{judicial review}} against the PSC. In the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal accepted that the source test {{is one of the}} tests that can be relied on to determine whether a decision by a body is amenable to judicial review. In addition, it noted that Datafin had held that the source test is not the only applicable test. However, the Court did not embark on a discussion of the nature test because it found that when the respondent's employer had made the decisions concerning her employment, it had acted pursuant to her contractual terms of service and had not exercised its <b>statutory</b> powers. Thus, the decisions were not susceptible to judicial review. It did not invariably follow that when a <b>statutory</b> body makes a decision it is exercising a <b>statutory</b> power.|$|E
