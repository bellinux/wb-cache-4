By allocating livestock more efficiently over space, spatial market integration should favour a sustainable use of scarce pasture resources. The geographical integration of markets is also critical for the prevention of entitlement failures and the insurance value of livestock. To be effective, strategies providing protection against local weather shocks require livestock prices to be relatively stable so that risk is shared over space and idiosyncratic price variations are smoothed.

40|$|Not {{only does}} {{livestock}} make {{an important contribution}} to rural incomes and export earnings in the Sahel, it is also kept as insurance against weather risk. Fluctuations in livestock prices can therefore trigger food entitlement failures. Using monthly price data from Niger, we show that livestock prices respond to droughts and pasture availability. They are also exposed to aggregate shifts in export revenues and meat demand that affect Niger and Its southern neighbour, Nigeria. These shifts add an important element of risk to the livelihood of Sahelian farmers and pastoralists. Famine early-wearning systems should keep an eye not only on weather shocks but also on macroeconomic conditions and other factors affecting the livestock economy. It is showed in this paper that livestock prices in Niger, a representative <b>Sahelian</b> <b>country,</b> respond not only to weather shocks but also to shifts in the rural and urban demand for meat in the country and in neighbouring Nigeria. The basis for the analysis is price data on 15 animal categories collected monthly in 38 districts of Niger over a period of 21 years.

Nevertheless, more than 90 percent of Niger’s labor force is employed in agriculture, which is predominantly subsistence oriented. Since the great famines of the 1970 s and 1980 s, the country has pursued agrarian intensification through technological change to address challenges to the food security situation. However, this approach has failed to recognize that the main characteristic of the Sahelian part of West Africa is the intricate complexity of the social, environmental, and economic dimensions that differentially affect male and female rural dwellers. One example is the patrilineal tenure system, which under increased population pressure has led to the exclusion of women and youth from agriculture in some areas. The Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) indicates that access to land is one important dimension of empowerment. In order to assess the role of empowerment in agricultural production, we use new household- and individual-level WEAI data from Niger and regression analysis. Our results show that empowerment is important for agricultural production and that households in which adult individuals are more empowered are more productive. This means that other and possibly more effective pathways to agrarian intensification exist and important agricultural productivity gains could be made by empowering men and women in rural households.

Although only one-eighth of the land considered arable, more than 90 percent of Niger’s labor force is employed in agriculture, which is predominantly subsistence oriented. Food security remains a major challenge in rural areas of Niger, and gender is a significant basis for the inequality among household members with respect to access to land. Access to land, which {{is a measure of the}} income-earning potential of an individual, is an important determinant of the distribution of bargaining power within the household. Because households may not act in a unitary manner when making decisions, the power of individuals within the household to exert their own preferences may determine welfare outcomes, such as spending on nutritious foods or healthcare. In this paper, we use new data for Niger and regression analyses to assess the importance of the intrahousehold distribution of power for the behavior of rural households. Our results reveal that men are significantly more empowered than women in rural households in Niger and that social protection programs such as water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and food-for-training contribute significantly to the empowerment of women. Our findings also point to the validity of the collective approach to modeling household behavior, as the distribution of power was shown to affect household behavior. In particular, we found that an increase in power in favor of the adult female significantly increases expenditures on healthcare and reduces spending on vices (cigarettes and alcohol).

40|$|Burkina Faso is a {{tropical}} <b>Sahelian</b> <b>country</b> in West Africa, {{with a long}} dry season, and a rainy season characterized by high uncertainty of rainfalls. The drought and the reconstruction of certain areas during the 1980 s has created shanty towns {{in the suburbs of}} large cities. Many handpumps have been installed to supply water to people in these suburban areas. Because of the growing demand for water, the authorities decided to replace some of the handpumps by diesel-powered driven pumps. Unfortunately, the high replacement costs of the equipment and the maintenance problems of this type of system make it difficult to manage. Sector 28 of Ouagadougou is a suburb without electricity or any type of conventional water supply system. For this reason, the International Water Engineering Centre (IWEC) of the University of Ottawa together with the Low Cost Water Supply and Sanitation Regional Centre (CREPA) initiated a water and sanitation project to deal with this problem. One of the main goals of the project was to install a solar water pumping unit in Sector 28 and to conduct research studies related to it. We performed an economic comparison between the solar pumping system and have other options technically able to supply the same daily low rate. These options are: diesel-powered driven pumps, handpumps, extension of the existing water supply network, pump driven by the electrical grid, and rainwater catchment cistern using roofs. All the possible scenarios have been analyzed in this study in order to draw conclusions and make recommendations about this water supply alternative. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

During dry periods, residents have utilized groundwater to secure access to drinking water. Groundwater is accessed via hand-dug wells and, since the 1970 's, first via modern wells and later on boreholes equipped with manual pumps provided by governmental and non-governmental organizations. Insufficient knowledge of groundwater resources has led to low success rates in exploitation, however, and groundwater resource evaluation {{appears to be a}} prerequisite for sustainable water management. This article presents an evaluation of groundwater potential within a watershed of 5911 ha in Eastern Burkina Faso. The results are derived from 18 months of field work in which water was sampled monthly during the rainy season from rain gauges, piezometers and boreholes with hand pump. Deep groundwater from boreholes was also collected during dry season. More than 100 samples were collected from four characteristic sites in the research watershed and sent for laboratory analysis for chloride ion concentration. Stream discharges were measured using divers, precipitation and other climatic data were collected from rain gauges and weather station. The water levels in piezometers were daily monitored on the four sites from 2004 to 2005. These data have supported an estimate of groundwater potential using chloride mass balance method, which has been supplemented and validated using the equations of water table fluctuation method.

40|$|Niger is a {{landlocked}} <b>Sahelian</b> <b>country,</b> {{two-thirds of}} {{which is in the}} Sahara Desert. Although only one-eighth of the land considered arable, the overwhelming majority of Niger’s households is involved in rain-fed agriculture largely for subsistence. Given erratic rainfall and low soil fertility, most smallholders fail to produce enough food to meet household requirements. Income diversification is thus the norm among these rural households and different income-generating activities offer alternative pathways out of poverty for households as well as a mechanism for managing risk in an uncertain environment. Empowerment is likely to be an important factor affecting the ability of households to diversity their activity portfolio and may also affect activity-incomes and thereby household welfare. In this study, I use new household- and individual-level empowerment data from the Tahoua region of Niger and regression analysis to quantify the effects of a range of human capital measures including empowerment on the activity portfolio and activity incomes of rural households. My findings reveal that empowerment in particular {{plays an important role in}} enabling households to engage in mixed diversification strategy, which combines staple cropping with nonfarm activities and migration. This is a “last resort” strategy for households in lower landholding quintiles to ensure food security and complement an inadequate resource base. Controlling for activity choice, three empowerment indicators in particular—confidence, group membership, and tenure security—strongly and positively affect income from staple and cash cropping, which on average makes up about 90 percent of household income. In fact, empowerment is the only human capital variable that strongly and positively affects total household income, opening up interesting avenues for policy interventions aimed at augmenting a household’s noncognitive ability through, for example, leadership training or encouraging producer group membership—to increase incomes of the rural poor.

40|$|In {{the highly}} risky {{environment}} of the Sahel, livestock {{play an important role}} as a form of insurance against weather risk in addition to their important contributions to rural incomes, urban meat supply and export earnings. Most Sahelian farmers and pastoralists pursue production strategies that seek to minimise risk associated with adverse climatic conditions. To be effective, traditional strategies of this kind require livestock prices to be relatively stable. This condition has, however, rarely been met in the Sahel under severe crisis conditions like drought or economic disruption where food entitlement failures and collapses in livestock-grain terms of trade have occurred. An issue which has not received adequate attention in the analysis of drought prone livestock economies of the Sahel is that weather is probably not the only culprit for food entitlement failures. Macro-economic conditions and other factors affecting the livestock sector also play an important role through their effect on urban demand for meat, livestock prices, and thus the value of assets liquidated by farmers and pastoralists in hard times. Knowledge and understanding of livestock price developments and their determinants in a Sahelian context where traditional adjustments to weather risk over time and space coexist with rising urban demand for meat therefore provide a key input to early warning, market and trade policies. This paper discusses livestock price developments in Niger, the determinants of livestock prices and market integration. It shows that livestock prices in Niger, a representative <b>Sahelian</b> <b>country,</b> respond not only to weather stocks but also to shifts in the rural and urban demand for meat in the country and in neighbouring Nigeria.

The case of the Sahel, plagued by civil strife, poverty, hunger and natural calamities such as desertification and droughts, has become a major challenge facing humankind today. The environment and the living conditions have continued to deteriorate despite heavy investment, innumerable plans of action and new organizations and institutes, which considering that worldwide our generation has experienced more technological breakthroughs than ever before, makes the problem the more poignant. In spite of the overall gloomy picture, there have been successes. The question is why these cases, rare though they may be, have not been reported and shared among other African countries and the international community. Using practical examples and sound data Survival in the Sahel shows how past development strategies have contributed to the region's deteriorating conditions. But it also shares some of the success stories of the last two decades, recommending new development approaches, and presenting some alternative ways to deal with the present Sahelian situation.
