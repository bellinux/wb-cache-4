5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed <b>stops.</b> The usual causes for missing <b>stops</b> are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the <b>stops,</b> or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression <b>stops.</b> Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of <b>stops</b> the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|Lenis <b>stops</b> in Wagiman {{sound like}} English voiced <b>stops</b> and are {{therefore}} written using the Roman alphabet letters b, d and g. Fortis <b>stops,</b> however, sound more like voiceless <b>stops</b> in English, but are slightly longer than lenis <b>stops.</b> They are written with two voiceless letters, pp, tt and kk when they occur between two vowels.|$|E
5|$|A deep {{stop was}} {{originally}} an extra stop introduced by divers during ascent, at a greater depth than the deepest stop required by their computer algorithm or tables. This practice {{is based on}} empirical observations by technical divers such as Richard Pyle, who found that they were less fatigued if they made some additional <b>stops</b> for short periods at depths considerably deeper than those calculated with the currently published decompression algorithms. More recently computer algorithms that are claimed to use deep <b>stops</b> have become available, but these algorithms {{and the practice of}} deep <b>stops</b> have not been adequately validated. Deep <b>stops</b> are likely to be made at depths where ingassing continues for some slow tissues, so the addition of deep <b>stops</b> of any kind can only be included in the dive profile when the decompression schedule has been computed to include them, so that such ingassing of slower tissues can be taken into account. Nevertheless, deep <b>stops</b> may be added on a dive that relies on a personal dive computer with real-time computation, as the PDC will track the effect of the stop on its decompression schedule. Deep <b>stops</b> are otherwise similar to any other staged decompression, but are unlikely to use a dedicated decompression gas, as they are usually not more than two to three minutes long.|$|E

40|$|Selective <b>stopping</b> {{paradigms}} address selectivity in controlled behavior, {{as subjects}} <b>stop</b> certain responses or responses to certain stimuli. The literature has discussed 2 strategies for selective <b>stopping.</b> First, selective <b>stopping</b> may prolong the <b>stop</b> process {{by adding a}} discrimination stage (Independent Discrim-inate then <b>Stop).</b> Second, selective <b>stopping</b> may involve <b>stopping</b> nonselectively and then restarting the response if the signal is an ignore signal (<b>Stop</b> then Discriminate). We discovered {{a variant of the}} first strategy that occurred often in our experiments and previously published experiments: The requirement to discriminate <b>stop</b> and ignore signals may interact with the go process, invalidating the independent race model (Dependent Discriminate then <b>Stop).</b> Our experiments focused on stimulus selective <b>stopping,</b> in which subjects <b>stop</b> to one signal and ignore another. When <b>stop</b> and ignore signals were equally likely, some subjects used the <b>Stop</b> then Discriminate strategy and others used the Dependent Discriminate then <b>Stop</b> strategy. When <b>stop</b> signals were more frequent than ignore signals, most subjects used the <b>Stop</b> then Discriminate strategy; when ignore signals were more frequent than <b>stop</b> signals, most subjects used the Dependent Discriminate then <b>Stop</b> strategy. The commonly accepted Independent Discriminate then <b>Stop</b> strategy was seldom implemented. Selective <b>stopping</b> was either not selective (<b>Stop</b> then Discrim-inate), or interacted with going (Dependent Discriminate then <b>Stop).</b> Implications for the cognitive science, lifespan development, clinical science, and neuroscience of selective <b>stopping</b> are discussed...|$|R

5|$|SBS {{implementation}} on {{the corridor}} {{is planned for}} November 2017. In the Rockaways and in Broad Channel, due to less dense land uses, and due to lower utilization of <b>stops,</b> several existing Q52 and Q53 <b>stops</b> will be consolidated or discontinued. Q22 local service will continue to serve the <b>stops</b> in the Rockaways, while the low volume <b>stops</b> at Cross Bay Boulevard and 5th Road will be discontinued. A new stop at Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 84th Street would replace <b>stops</b> at Beach 81st Street and Beach 86th Street on the Q52. In Broad Channel two <b>stops</b> would be relocated: the northbound stop at Cross Bay Boulevard and East 9th Road would be moved north to Noel Road to be symmetrical with the southbound stop, and the southbound stop at West 15th Road would be moved south to West 17th Road to be symmetrical with the northbound stop, and to be adjacent to a crosswalk. <b>Stops</b> on Woodhaven Boulevard would be modified as well: the stop at Atlantic Avenue would be moved north to 91st Avenue, allowing Q52 and Q53 service to use the overpass over Atlantic Avenue using the bus lane, as opposed to using the slow service road. Two SBS <b>stops</b> will be added–at 101st Avenue and Woodhaven Boulevard, and at Pitkin Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard–to provide transfers to the Q8 and Q11, respectively. Stations on Woodhaven Boulevard at Jamaica Avenue, 91st Avenue and 101st Avenue, and at Cross Bay Boulevard at Liberty Avenue (northbound) and Rockaway Boulevard (southbound) would be new stations that {{were built in the}} median by the NYCDOT.|$|E

5|$|The {{depth and}} {{duration}} of each stop is calculated to reduce the inert gas excess in the most critical tissues to a concentration which will allow further ascent without unacceptable risk.
