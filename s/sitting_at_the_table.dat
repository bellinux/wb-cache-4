25|$|There are, however, {{objective}} {{factors that}} prevent the illusion from succeeding completely: (1) the canvas is two-dimensional while reality is three-dimensional, (2) {{the uniqueness of}} the view-point (humans have two eyes). Metzinger compensates for the missing spatiality in his two-dimensional representation by giving other cues for depth, in addition to relative size: shading and shadows, source of light, occlusion (e.g., the stage or table upon which the woman dances cuts 'in front' of the woman <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table).</b> Metzinger represents a subjective effect objectively on the canvas, imitating subjective phenomena (of vision) objectively. Henri Poincaré, in Science and Hypothesis, 1902, discusses 'representative' space (visual, tactile and motor space) versus 'geometrical' space.|$|E
500|$|On 25 May, Warne asked Potter to {{send him}} one of the two dummy books she had in her {{possession}} in order to check the size of the plates before continuing with the printer's blocks. He thought there was [...] "too much bend" [...] about the dog's nose and the division between its legs was unclear. He kept the two plates back for Potter's inspection before sending them off to make the blocks. On 26 May, he received two more originals and the circular portrait of the cat for the cover. He thought the background of the colour illustration of Ribby and Duchess <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> too light, but liked the pen-and-ink sketches. Potter struggled with the dog illustrations, and sent Warne a photograph of her canine model to prove the dog's ruff was as large as she had depicted it.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard became Parsons' [...] "magical partner" [...] for a sex magic ritual {{involving}} {{that was}} intended to summon an incarnation of a goddess. Although they got on well as fellow occultists, tensions {{between the two men}} were apparent in more domestic settings. Hubbard and Northrup made no secret of their relationship; another lodger at Parsons' house described how he saw Hubbard [...] "living off Parsons' largesse and making out with his girlfriend right in front of him. Sometimes when {{the two of them were}} <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> together, the hostility was almost tangible." [...] Despite the tensions between them, Hubbard, Northrup and Parsons agreed at the start of 1946 that they would go into business together, buying yachts on the East Coast and sailing them to California to sell at a profit. They set up a business partnership on January 15, 1946 under the name of [...] "Allied Enterprises", with Parsons putting up $20,000 of capital, Hubbard adding $1,200 and Northrup contributing nothing. Hubbard and Northrup left for Florida towards the end of April, taking with him $10,000 drawn from the Allied Enterprises account to fund the purchase of the partnership's first yacht. Weeks passed without word from Hubbard. Louis Culling, another O.T.O. member, wrote to Karl Germer to explain the situation: ...|$|E

Grammatically, the wording [...] "The nice old English police inspector who was sitting at the table" [...] can be understood as a nominal group (a description of someone), which functions as the subject of the information exchange and as the person being identified as [...] "Mr Morse".|$|E
2500|$|The band caused further {{controversy}} in February 2016 when Oliver Sykes trashed Coldplay's {{table at the}} 2016 NME Awards during a live performance of Bring Me The Horizon's track 'Happy Song'. Although some people thought the table trashing was because of a prior feud between the two bands relating to similar album artwork, Sykes later stated that the act wasn't an act of 'dirty protest', and suggested that it was 'pure coincidence' that Coldplay were <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> he trampled. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin allegedly laughed off the incident, stating that [...] "it was great, very rock and roll".|$|E
2500|$|The book {{begins with}} the line [...] "It was a dark and stormy night," [...] an allusion to the opening words in Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 1830 novel Paul Clifford. Unable to sleep during a thunderstorm, Meg descends from her attic room to find Charles Wallace <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{drinking}} milk and eating bread and jam. They are then joined by their mother, and are visited by their new eccentric neighbor, Mrs Whatsit. In the course of conversation, Mrs Whatsit casually mentions {{there is such a}} thing as a tesseract, which causes Dr. Murry to almost faint.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} {{account of the}} {{creation}} of the art of memory centers around the story of Simonides of Ceos, a famous Greek poet, who was invited to chant a lyric poem in honor of his host, a nobleman of Thessaly. While praising his host, Simonides also mentioned the twin gods Castor and Pollux. [...] When the recital was complete, the nobleman selfishly told Simonides that he would only pay him half of the agreed upon payment for the panegyric, and {{that he would have to}} get the balance of the payment from the two gods he had mentioned. A short time later, Simonides was told that two men were waiting for him outside. [...] He left to meet the visitors but could find no one. [...] Then, while he was outside the banquet hall, it collapsed, crushing everyone within. The bodies were so disfigured that they could not be identified for proper burial. But, Simonides was able to remember where each of the guests had been <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and so was able to identify them for burial. This experience suggested to Simonides the principles which were to become central to the later development of the art he reputedly invented.|$|E
2500|$|On September 22, 1827, Joseph and Emma took a {{horse and}} {{carriage}} belonging to Joseph Knight, Sr., {{and went to a}} hill now known as the Hill Cumorah where Joseph said he received a set of golden plates. This created a great deal of excitement in the area. In December 1827, the couple decided to move to Harmony, where they reconciled—to some extent—with Isaac and Elizabeth Hale. Emma's parents helped her and Joseph obtain a house and a small farm. Once they settled in, Joseph began work on the Book of Mormon with Emma acting as a scribe. She became a physical witness of the plates, reporting that she felt them through a cloth, traced the pages through the cloth with her fingers, heard the metallic sound they made as she moved them, and felt their weight. She later wrote in an interview with her son, Joseph Smith III: [...] "In writing for your father I frequently wrote day after day, often <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> close by him, he sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us." [...] In Harmony on June 15, 1828, Emma gave birth to her first child—a son named Alvin—who lived only a few hours.|$|E
