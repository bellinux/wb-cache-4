5|$|Stems mainly {{provide support}} to the leaves and {{reproductive}} structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of <b>strawberry</b> <b>plants</b> or {{in the process of}} layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely {{populated}} {{communities around the}} bay transformed during the 20th century. Following the devastating 1900 hurricane, donations by the newly created Red Cross, including millions of <b>strawberry</b> <b>plants</b> to Gulf Coast farmers, helped revive area communities. This and the subsequent establishment of a major strawberry farm in the area by Texaco founder Joseph S. Cullinan made Pasadena an important fruit producer for many years afterward. The newly established community of Texas City opened its port and railroad junctions shipping cotton and grain. In fact, because the port had opened just before the 1900 hurricane, {{it was able to}} handle Galveston's diverted shipping traffic until the island's damaged port was repaired. Following another hurricane in 1915, the Texas City Dike was built to protect the Texas City ship channel from sediment movement in future storms, thus helping to build confidence in the safety of the port. One of the most immediate effects of the dike, however, was to increase the salt levels in West Bay, between Galveston and the southwest coastline.|$|E

At its height, the city's strawberry growers shipped as many as 28 train carloads of strawberries each day. To honor that history, the city still holds an annual Pasadena Strawberry Festival. Strawberry Road stretches through much of the city near where the old strawberry crops grew. Attendance at the annual Strawberry Festival was 56,000 in 2008.|$|E

40|$|CDATA[In {{order to}} study the {{physical}} and chemical characteristic of 4 horticultural substrates and their behavior on <b>strawberry</b> <b>plant</b> cultivated in inert media, a study was carried during 2009 to 2010. Four substrates were tested in this experiment. They were composed by the byproduct oil cake and the vermiculite with the proportions [100 : 0], [90 : 10], [80 : 20] and [70 : 30] for T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 4, respectively. In the laboratory, the {{physical and chemical properties}} of these 4 blends are studied. In the greenhouse, their behavior on strawberry crop based on pH drainage evolution after each fertigation are controlled. The first supports compounded by 100 % of oil cake and the second compounded by 90 % of oil cake and 10 % of vermiculite had the best physical and chemical characteristics: air filled porosity, percentage of drainage, moisture content, bulk density, pH and Electrical Conductivity (EC). The monitoring of fertigation, by the pH drainage evolution, from 1 to 14 May; period of high photosynthetic activity, shows that the behaviour of the mixtures T 1 [100 : 0] and T 2 [90 : 20] on the <b>strawberry</b> <b>plant,</b> grown in inert media, gave good conditions to uptake the nutrients and relatively optimized, the growth of <b>strawberry</b> <b>plant.</b> ]]...|$|R

25|$|The bulk {{of modern}} {{commercial}} production uses the plasticulture system. In this method, raised beds are formed each year, fumigated, {{and covered with}} plastic to prevent weed growth and erosion. Plants, usually obtained from northern nurseries, are planted through holes punched in this covering, and irrigation tubing is run underneath. Runners are removed from the plants as they appear, {{in order to encourage}} the plants to put most of their energy into fruit development. At the end of the harvest season, the plastic is removed and the plants are plowed into the ground. Because <b>strawberry</b> <b>plants</b> more than a year or two old begin to decline in productivity and fruit quality, this system of replacing the plants each year allows for improved yields and denser plantings. However, because it requires a longer growing season to allow for establishment of the plants each year, and because of the increased costs in terms of forming and covering the mounds and purchasing plants each year, it is not always practical in all areas.|$|E
500|$|With Whigs in power, Greeley saw the {{opportunity}} to launch a daily penny newspaper for their constituency. [...] The New York Tribune launched on April 10, 1841. [...] Unlike the Herald or the Sun, it generally shied about from graphic crime coverage; Greeley saw his newspaper as having a moral mission to uplift society, and frequently focused his energies on the newspaper's editorials—"weapons…in a ceaseless war to improve society"—and political coverage. [...] While a lifelong opponent of slavery and, for time, a proponent of socialism, Greeley's attitudes were never exactly fixed: [...] "The result was a potpourri of philosophical inconsistencies and contradictions that undermined Greeley's effectiveness as both logician and polemicist." [...] However, his moralism appealed to rural America; with six months of beginning the Tribune, Greeley combined The New-Yorker and The Log Cabin into a new publication, the Weekly Tribune. [...] The weekly version circulated nationwide, serving as a digest of news melded with agriculture tips. [...] Offering prizes like <b>strawberry</b> <b>plants</b> and gold pens to salesmen, the Weekly Tribune reached a circulation of 50,000 within 10 years, outpacing the Heralds weekly edition.|$|E

60|$|A species remains {{unchanged}} {{so long as}} the potentiality {{of development}} resident in B remains unaltered; so long, e.g., as the buds of the strawberry sucker tend to become typical <b>strawberry</b> <b>plants.</b> In the case of the progressive evolution of a species, the developmental potentiality of B becomes of a higher and higher order. In retrogressive evolution, the contrary would be the case. The phenomena of atavism seem to show that retrogressive evolution that is, the return of a species to one or other of its earlier forms, is a possibility to be reckoned with. The simplification of structure, which is so common in the parasitic members of a group, however, does not properly come under this head. The worm-like, limbless Lernoea has no resemblance to any of the stages of development of the many-limbed active animals of the group to which it belongs. [89] Note 2 (p. 49).|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} Major Randolph took her with Adele {{in a light}} cariole over the ranch. Although his domain was nearly {{as large as the}} {{adjoining}} wheat plain, it was not, like that, monopolized by one enormous characteristic yield, but embraced a more diversified product. There were acres and acres of potatoes in rows of endless and varying succession; there were miles of wild oats and barley, which overtopped them as they drove in narrow lanes of dry and dusty monotony; there were orchards of pears, apricots, peaches, and nectarines, and vineyards of grapes, so comparatively dwarfed in height that they scarcely reached to the level of their eyes, yet laden and breaking beneath the weight of their ludicrously disproportionate fruit. What seemed to be a vast green plateau covered with tiny patches, that headed the northern edge of the prospect, was an enormous bed of <b>strawberry</b> <b>plants.</b> But everywhere, crossing the track, bounding the fields, orchards, and vineyards, intersecting the paths of the whole domain, were narrow irrigating ducts and channels of running water.|$|E
60|$|The {{circumstances}} of his return were as singular as those of his departure. So far as Mr. Lidgett's somewhat choleric outline can be filled in from Plattner's hesitating statements, {{it would appear that}} on Wednesday evening, towards the hour of sunset, the former gentleman, having dismissed evening preparation, was engaged in his garden, picking and eating strawberries, a fruit of which he is inordinately fond. It is a large old-fashioned garden, secured from observation, fortunately, by a high and ivy-covered red-brick wall. Just as he was stooping over a particularly prolific plant, there was a flash in the air and a heavy thud, and before he could look round, some heavy body struck him violently from behind. He was pitched forward, crushing the strawberries he held in his hand, and that so roughly, that his silk hat--Mr. Lidgett adheres to the older ideas of scholastic costume--was driven violently down upon his forehead, and almost over one eye. This heavy missile, which slid over him sideways and collapsed into a sitting posture among the <b>strawberry</b> <b>plants,</b> proved to be our long-lost Mr. Gottfried Plattner, in an extremely dishevelled condition. He was collarless and hatless, his linen was dirty, and there was blood upon his hands. Mr. Lidgett was so indignant and surprised that he remained on all-fours, and with his hat jammed down on his eye, while he expostulated vehemently with Plattner for his disrespectful and unaccountable conduct.|$|E

50|$|The host of Diplocarpon earliana is the <b>{{strawberry}}</b> <b>plant.</b> The disease mainly infects {{strawberry leaves}} at any {{stage of the}} its life cycle, but may infect {{all parts of the}} <b>strawberry</b> <b>plant,</b> including the petioles, fruits, and stems. The disease is characterized by numerous small, purplish to brownish lesions (from 1/16 to 3/16 of an inch in diameter) with undefined borders on the upper surface of the leaf. These symptoms are different from strawberry leaf spot which has brown lesions with defined borders and a lighter center. As the leaf scorch progresses over time, the leaves turn brown and dry up, resembling a burnt or “scorched” appearance as indicated by its disease name. It is common for the petioles of the leaves to have purple, sunken lesions that resemble streaks. If these streaks are severe enough, they may lead to the bowing of the petiole which in turn kills the leaf. Strawberry leaf scorch infects all parts of the flower, leading to unattractive blemishes on the fruit (strawberries).|$|R
