5|$|Although {{individual}} members of the regiment had served as advisors with the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) since 1962, {{it was not until}} April 1965 that the government announced that a battalion would be deployed to Vietnam. Between June 1965 and March 1972 the units of the regiment would conduct sixteen rotations in Vietnam, with the first seven battalions completing two 12-month tours, while 8 and 9 RAR would each serve one. Consequently, following a period of hurried training and administration 1 RAR joined the US 173rd Airborne Brigade at Bien Hoa airbase outside of Saigon in June 1965. After initially defending the airbase, 1 RAR steadily increased the scope of its patrols. For example, in January 1966, 1 RAR assaulted a large Viet Cong headquarters complex in the Ho Bo Woods as a part of Operation Crimp; which the Americans hailed as the first <b>strategic</b> <b>intelligence</b> victory of the war. The battalion subsequently completed a 12 month-tour attached to US forces, during which it developed new tactics and techniques that later became standard for Australian battalions and supporting arms and services that would subsequently operate in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|During the {{fighting}} the Australians had faced stiff resistance and had suffered eight killed and 29 wounded, while claiming 27 Viet Cong killed and a further 30 probably killed. The Americans {{had also been}} involved in heavy fighting and their casualties included 14 killed and 76 wounded. Total communist casualties included 128 confirmed killed, and another 190 probably killed, as well as 92 captured and another 509 suspects detained. In addition many more Viet Cong were thought likely to have perished in the tunnels as they were collapsed by charges laid by the Australian engineers. The Americans later claimed that {{the headquarters of the}} communist 4th Military Region had also been destroyed. Due to the quantity of information recovered from the thousands of captured documents alone, the battle was later described as the first allied <b>strategic</b> <b>intelligence</b> victory of the war. So significant was the find that both Westmoreland and General Joseph McChristian, the head of Intelligence at MACV, visited 1 RAR during Operation Crimp. Allied operations against the communist tunnels had been largely ad hoc, and the Australians began to develop the earliest techniques for exploring and destroying them. Later, at least partially {{as a result of the}} success of the Australians in clearing some of the shorter tunnels, American units adopted similar tactics and created a number of tunnel-clearance teams, known popularly as Tunnel Rats.|$|E

40|$|The {{events of}} the Arab spring reminds us how {{individual}} citizens {{have the power to}} overthrow powerful regimes and destabilize complete regions. The dynamics of such bottom-up instigated revolutions seem to be in line with the (Social) Constructivism paradigm. The problem though, is that this paradigm lacks a powerful forecasting method that could have identified the Arab spring as a possible future event on beforehand. However the similar Complex Adaptive Systems paradigm does have a powerful forecasting tool; Agent-Based modeling. After an exploratory literature study we discovered that it is unlikely that Agent-Based modeling is applied by NATO state intelligence services for their forecasts on geopolitical dynamics on a Strategic level. This despite our expectations that Agent-Based modeling would be a lot more powerful in analyzing strategic geopolitical dynamics than the current methods of NATO state intelligence services. To confirm our expectations we performed an exploratory study to; How Agent-Based modeling can add value to the <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> process of NATO state intelligence services? Base on a literature study we have identified: * What makes Agent-Based modeling suitable for the <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> process, compared to other methods; * How currently the <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> process is executed by NATO state intelligence services; and * Which criteria should be used to compare the value of different <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> processes. The criteria were used to identify limitations of the current <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> process. For each of these limitations we checked whether Agent-Based modeling would be suitable to overcome (partly) the limitations. This resulted in the following list of how Agent-Based modeling can add value to the <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> process: * Risk scenarios can be built in line with the Complex Adaptive Systems paradigm, thereby increasing the external validity of analyses of volatile states; * A high number of risk scenarios can be taken into account, thereby decreasing the likelihood of unexpected events and allowing the development of more detailed scenarios; * Sensitivity analyses can be executed to assess intelligence, {{to take into account the}} uncertainty of intelligence, identify critical unknowns, determine de-warning indicators for negative warnings, prioritize indicators in the intelligence collection plan, provide bandwidth values for relevant critical unknowns and develop more accurate conditional conclusions. This allows for more intelligence to be used, providing more focus in the intelligence gathering process and be explicit about the uncertainty of the conclusions; * The intelligence analyst can gain a better understanding of the dynamics of the system under study, thereby increasing the transferability of the analysis as well as the external validity in the long run; * The <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> process will become more quantitative, thereby making the process more objective and increase internal validity, reliability and confirmability; * Explicit integration between near term- and mid/long term assessments can be realized, due to same detail the Agent-Based model will provide for both types of scenarios. Thereby making the process less costly, increase internal validity, reliability and confirmability; and * (Adaptive) Policies can be deducted and developed based on the risk scenario set, thereby making more effective and pro-active policies. In order to evaluate our own findings and provide a starting point for NATO to introduce Agent-Based modeling into their doctrine, we have designed a new <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> process that utilizes all these benefits of Agent-Based modeling. Based on literature and our own experience with executing a large part of this process on an actual case, we are confident that it is possible to implement our new <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> process design into practice. However we have also discovered that integrating Agent-Based modeling into the <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> process can significantly extend the duration of the analysis. Therefore it depends on the case and the available time for the analysis, whether it is sensible to apply the new Agent-Based modeling driven <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> process or the traditional <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> process. We especially recommend that based on our thesis, some research will be done to; * Increase the validity of our findings; * Identify under which circumstances it is still practical to use Agent-Based modeling in the <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> process; and * Iteratively improve in practice our new <b>Strategic</b> Geopolitical <b>Intelligence</b> process.
