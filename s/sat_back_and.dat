25|$|I {{have often}} <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> thought just {{how nice it}} would be if you could relive your life based on the {{experience}} gained. For myself, I would never again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things. On the two occasions I have tried to do this , I have failed, not because I lack followers, or because of the opposition of opposing bodies, but because of the activities of anarchists and those who are envious of your success and popularity.|$|E
25|$|I knew I {{was going}} to cop a lot of stick {{but it will be}} like water off a duck's back...I {{expected}} stick {{at the start of the}} innings, and I'm sure it will carry on through the whole series. But I just <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> laughed at the opposition, with their swearing and 'traitor' remarks... some of them can hardly speak English. My affiliation is with England. In fact, I'm starting to speak too much like Darren Gough... In fact, I'm going to get one of Gough's tattoos with three lions and my number underneath...No one can say I'm not English.|$|E
500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be." [...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. I haven’t just <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} him that he had mapped out his whole life. He <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> satisfied, <b>and</b> caught the sound of {{emptiness}} in his room, emphasized by the stilly tick of his watch.|$|R
60|$|I went, and, as Bat's guest, was {{received}} as Royalty is not. We <b>sat</b> well <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{looked out on}} the packed thousands. It was Morgiana and Drexel, that fluid and electric review which Bat--though he gave Lafone the credit--really created.|$|R
60|$|A sudden thought flashed into Maggie's mind. She {{began to}} see light. She obeyed at once. The two women <b>sat</b> well <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{out of sight of}} the house. La Belle Nita held the handle of the door in her hand while she spoke, as though to prevent any one entering.|$|R
500|$|In February 1927, an {{agreement}} {{was signed by}} five leading Hollywood movie companies: [...] Famous Players-Lasky (soon {{to be part of}} Paramount), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal, First National, and Cecil B. DeMille's small but prestigious Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC). The five studios agreed to collectively select just one provider for sound conversion. The alliance then <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> waited to see what sort of results the forerunners came up with. In May, Warner Bros. sold back its exclusivity rights to ERPI (along with the Fox-Case sublicense) and signed a new royalty contract similar to Fox's for use of Western Electric technology. As Fox and Warners pressed forward with sound cinema in different directions, both technologically and commercially—Fox with newsreels and then scored dramas, Warners with talking features—so did ERPI, which sought to corner the market by signing up the five allied studios.|$|E
500|$|Debbi Peterson {{explained}} {{in an interview}} with MTV UK in 1989 about why Prince gave them the song: [...] " [...] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> thought about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinter {{strongly}} opposed the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War, the United States' 2001 War in Afghanistan, and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. [...] Among his provocative political statements, Pinter called Prime Minister Tony Blair a [...] "deluded idiot" [...] and compared {{the administration of}} President George W. Bush to Nazi Germany. [...] He stated that the United States [...] "was charging towards world domination while the American public and Britain's 'mass-murdering' prime minister <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> watched." [...] He was very active in the antiwar movement in the United Kingdom, speaking at rallies held by the Stop the War Coalition and frequently criticising American aggression, as when he asked rhetorically, in his acceptance speech for the Wilfred Owen Award for Poetry on 18 March 2007: [...] "What would Wilfred Owen make of the invasion of Iraq? A bandit act, an act of blatant state terrorism, demonstrating absolute contempt for the conception of international law." ...|$|E
50|$|While in prison, Kaggs plotted revenge. His cellmate, Butcher, {{quickly became}} friends with the big man and soon let him into their escape plot. What {{happened}} next demonstrates the depths of Kagg’s evil. He sold out his friend to the prison warden <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> while Butcher <b>and</b> the other would be escapees were gunned down during the attempt.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} Harris threw away the sculls, {{got up and}} left his seat, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> on his <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> stuck his legs in the air. Montmorency howled, and turned a somersault, and the top hamper jumped up, and all the things came out.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the shows}} I've been in," [...] she said, mordantly, [...] "the author wasn't {{allowed to go}} about the place getting fresh with the leading lady. In the shows I've been in the author <b>sat</b> at the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> spoke when he was spoken to. In the shows I've been in..." ...|$|R
500|$|According to sportswriter Joseph Durso, [...] "on {{days when}} [...] amazing Mets were, for some reason, amazing, he [...] simply <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> let the writers swarm over {{the heroes of}} the diamond. On days when the Mets were less than amazing—and there were [...] many more days like that—he stepped into the vacuum and {{diverted}} the writers' attention, and typewriters, to his own flamboyance... the perfect link with the public was formed, and it grew stronger as the team grew zanier". The Mets became {{an alternative to the}} stuffy Yankees that appealed to the younger generation of fans. As the losing continued, a particular fan favorite was [...] "Marvelous" [...] Marv Throneberry, who was a [...] "lightning-rod for disaster" [...] in the 1962 season, striking out to kill rallies, or dropping pop flies and routine throws to first base. During one game, Throneberry hit a massive shot to right, winding up on third base, only to be called out for missing first. Stengel came from the dugout to argue, only to be told that Throneberry had missed second base as well.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the album's release, Manson made {{a series}} of disparaging {{comments}} regarding Interscope and its artistic censorship; as well as its then-CEO Jimmy Iovine, who Manson said [...] "wasn't smart enough to understand what [...] do." [...] He also accused the label of caring more about Vitamin Water [...] than music. Several days after the album's release, Trent Reznor – who, as of 2015, remains friends and business partners with Iovine – called Manson a [...] "dopey clown", and said that [...] "He is a malicious guy and will step on anybodies face to succeed and cross any line of decency." [...] Manson responded by accusing Reznor of professional jealousy, saying: [...] "Since I've known Trent, he's always let his jealousy and bitterness for other people get in the way. I'm not talking about me—I <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> watched him be jealous of Kurt Cobain and Billy Corgan {{and a lot of other}} musicians in the past. I just don't find time to do that. I stopped thinking about him a while back." ...|$|E
500|$|Tony! Toni! Toné! {{completed}} recording House of Music in September 1996, and {{the album}} was then mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. House of Music was named after a record store in the band's native Oakland, which had closed several {{years prior to the}} album's release. In an interview for Billboard, Wiggins said, [...] "We title all our albums {{at the end of the}} project. We <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> listened to everything, and it reminded us of this mom-and-pop store around our way in Oakland." [...] "We grew up in a house of music," [...] Wiggins continued, remarking how their father was a blue guitarist and music had a unifying effect on people. According to Billboards Shawnee Smith, the album's title described a varied, complete work distinct from a contemporary music market oversaturated by [...] "retro-soul groups". The cover and booklet photos were taken by photographer William Claxton, who captured Tony! Toni! Toné! dressed in casual and formal, retro clothing. This departure from the more outré wardrobe of the band's past was interpreted by journalist Brandon Ousley as an effort to promote [...] "the elegance of 1960s-era Black America and legendary soul acts to a modern generation".|$|E
60|$|The Tiger went next. Dorothy <b>sat</b> {{upon his}} <b>back</b> <b>and</b> locked {{her arms around}} his striped neck, for he had no mane to cling to. He made the leap {{straight}} and true as an arrow from a bow, and ere Dorothy realized it she was out of danger and standing by Ozma's side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Like others, neither more nor less," [...] {{she replied}} with a shrug of her rounded shoulders. [...] "Would you have had him let you die? I think the brave man was he who got {{in front of the}} bull and twisted its nose, not he who <b>sat</b> on its <b>back</b> <b>and</b> poked at it with a spear." ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{so intent}} {{to escape the}} spiders' webs that only as his horse {{gathered}} together for a leap did he realise the ravine ahead. And then he realised it only to misunderstand and interfere. He was leaning forward on his horse's neck <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>and</b> <b>back</b> all too late.|$|R
500|$|Smith {{says that}} his reply [...] "provoked a flood of rhetoric"; the nationalists evaded his words and, one by one, gave passionate speeches about being [...] "a {{suppressed}} people... denied freedom in their own country" [...] who only wanted to [...] "return home and live normal, peaceful lives". Smith <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> waited for them to finish, then responded {{that there was nothing}} stopping them from going home at any time and living peacefully if they so wished, and that they were in this situation by their own hand. They themselves, he said, had refused the Anglo-Rhodesian accord agreed four years previously, which he said had offered Rhodesian blacks [...] "preferential franchise facilities", and they themselves had chosen to use [...] "unconstitutional means and terrorism in order to overthrow the legal government of our country." [...] The UANC delegates countered by railing against Smith even more strongly than before, repeating their previous arguments and rejecting the right of Britain to negotiate on their behalf. This argument went on for nine and a half hours before the conference broke up, Smith refusing outright to grant diplomatic immunity to the UANC's [...] "terrorist leaders who bear responsibility for... murders and other atrocities". Muzorewa said that he doubted Smith's sincerity in seeking a resolution if he was unwilling to grant such a [...] "very small thing" [...] as immunity to the nationalist leaders. The conference broke up without any agreement or progress having been made.|$|E
2500|$|The {{event was}} sold out, and the Wall Street Journal called it [...] "a revelation: in Alabama, a civil debate over God's existence." [...] Dawkins debated Lennox {{for the second}} time at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History in October 2008. The debate was titled [...] "Has Science Buried God?", in which Dawkins said that, {{although}} he would not accept it, a reasonably respectable case could be made for [...] "a deistic god, a sort of god of the physicist, a god of somebody like Paul Davies, who devised the laws of physics, god the mathematician, god who put together the cosmos {{in the first place and}} then <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> watched everything happen" [...] but not for a theistic god.|$|E
2500|$|Late Night with Conan O'Brien, {{originating}} from Studio 6A at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, premiered September 13, 1993 to unfavorable reviews from contemporary critics. This reception {{was not completely}} unsurprising; O'Brien wrote a self-deprecating New York Times piece titled [...] "O'Brien Flops!" [...] {{on the day of}} the show's premiere. Critics attacked O'Brien: Tom Shales of The Washington Post suggested that [...] "the host resume his previous identity, Conan O'Blivion." [...] Generally, critics viewed O'Brien as nervous and fidgety on-camera, and that he was [...] "too smart, too East Coast, too sophisticated, too young and even too tall to be successful." [...] The show was constantly at risk for cancellation; at one low point in 1994, NBC threatened to put him on a week-to-week contract. Executives were anxious to replace him with Greg Kinnear, who followed O'Brien with Later at 1:30am. Interns filled empty seats in the audience while affiliates began to inquire about replacement hosts. In one installment after a short stretch of reruns, sidekick Andy Richter described his vacation activities as follows: [...] "I <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> reminded myself what it's like to be unemployed." [...] The in-joke referenced the rumors floating in the trades that NBC was near canceling the program.|$|E
60|$|The {{transept}} of the Jesuit Church in Gardiner Street {{was almost}} full; and still {{at every moment}} gentlemen entered from the side door and, directed by the lay-brother, walked on tiptoe along the aisles until they found seating accommodation. The gentlemen were all well dressed and orderly. The light of the lamps of the church fell upon an assembly of black clothes and white collars, relieved here and there by tweeds, on dark mottled pillars of green marble and on lugubrious canvases. The gentlemen sat in the benches, having hitched their trousers slightly above their knees and laid their hats in security. They <b>sat</b> well <b>back</b> <b>and</b> gazed formally at the distant speck of red light which was suspended before the high altar.|$|R
60|$|This, of course, sent {{a thrill}} up the spine {{and through the}} {{imagination}} of Miss Dulphemia Rasselyer-Brown, because it showed that the chauffeur was a gentleman in disguise. She thought it very probable {{that he was a}} British nobleman, a younger son, very wild, of a ducal family; and she had her own theories as to why he had entered the service of the Rasselyer-Browns. To be quite candid about it, she expected that the Philippine chauffeur meant to elope with her, and every time he drove her from a dinner or a dance she <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> luxuriously, wishing <b>and</b> expecting the elopement to begin.|$|R
5000|$|... "He {{plays with}} his entire body, spirit, {{mind and heart}} taken over {{completely}} by the music it seems, possessed by it... The jury fell into amazingly animated discussion after that I can tell you. They had been writing furiously or consulting scores and shaking their heads during it - turning pages, looking from one to another. One by one they stopped moving, stopped writing and became absorbed like spectators at a bonfire <b>and</b> simply <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> watched <b>and</b> listened to this extraordinary outpouring of a supremely individual musical conception. ... In an odd way I believe a few may have felt threatened. Was {{it because he was}} a superior pianist to some of them? Certainly they did not react to any other competitor in this manner. However I fear it will work against him - I fear he cannot win - they will punish this brilliance - mere competitions are not for spirits like Bozhanov."

60|$|Captain Bowers <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{regarded}} her with impressive dignity. Miss Vickers met his gaze calmly and, {{with a pair}} of unwinking green eyes, stared him down.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> drummed on {{the table}} with his fingers. [...] "Well, I’ll risk it," [...] he said, at length; [...] "you’ll find him at 17, Beaufort Street, Bow." ...|$|E

60|$|Again {{the unseen}} thing of gloom had fluttered, and his being was vibrant with premonition of {{impending}} misfortune. He felt a disruptive influence {{at work in}} the flesh of him, and in all his muscles there was a seeming that they were about to begin to twitch. He <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> suddenly, <b>and</b> as suddenly leaned forward with his elbows on the table. A tremor ran dimly through the muscles of his body. It was like the first rustling of leaves before the oncoming of wind. He clenched his teeth. It came again, a spasmodic tensing of his muscles. He knew panic at the revolt within his being. His muscles no longer recognized his mastery over them. Again they spasmodically tensed, despite the will of him, for he had willed that they should not tense. This was revolution within himself, this was anarchy; and the terror of impotence rushed up in him as his flesh gripped and seemed to seize him in a clutch, chills running up <b>and</b> down his <b>back</b> <b>and</b> sweat starting on his brow. He glanced about the room, and all the details of it smote him with a strange sense of familiarity. It was as though he had just returned from a long journey. He looked across the table at his partner. Matt was watching him and smiling. An expression of horror spread over Jim's face.|$|R
6000|$|She came on Monday, {{surrounded}} by a gray halo, which had begun to grow as beautiful to my vision as the delicate tints of early dawn. When she began to read what she had last written, I seated myself in a chair by the grating. When she had finished, I sat silent for a minute, {{got up and walked}} about, came <b>back,</b> <b>sat</b> down, <b>and</b> was silent again. In my whole mind there {{did not seem to be}} one crevice into which an available thought concerning my travels could squeeze itself. She sat quietly looking out of the window at the apple-tree.

6000|$|Bill {{took the}} pack and shuffled it [...] "I orter be able to beat seven," [...] he said slowly. He handed the pack to Ned, drew a card, {{and the other three}} <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> laughed boisterously.|$|E
60|$|Outside Mr. Caryll hailed a chair, and {{had himself}} carried to his lodging in Old Palace Yard, where Leduc awaited him. As his bearers swung briskly along, Mr. Caryll <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> gave {{himself up to}} thought.|$|E
60|$|Sir Patrick <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, and {{stretched}} out his legs luxuriously.|$|R
