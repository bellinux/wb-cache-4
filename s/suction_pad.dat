40|$|This paper {{presents}} a versatile method {{to install a}} small machining robot onto a planar or slightly curved object. Normally, gripping tools provide a rigid connection between a robot and a target. However, {{if there is no}} graspable area on the target, the gripper cannot perform well. To overcome this problem, we proposed a deformable device that works as a universal <b>suction</b> <b>pad</b> and that can hold an ungraspable target by utilizing the jamming transition phenomenon. We determined the effect of the type of grains on the jamming transition phenomenon in terms of stability under jammed conditions. By comparing the four types of grains, we found that the tetrahedral-shaped grains performed the best. Subsequently, we evaluated the performance of the device. The suction force was 166 -N when the proposed device was affixed to a curved target. Next, we evaluated the stiffness of the device. The average deformations of the device were 0. 10 [*]mm, 0. 35 [*]mm, and 0. 04 [*]mm, respectively, when 50 -N downward vertical, horizontal, and upward vertical directional loads were applied to the device, which was affixed to the curved target.

40|$|Objectives: This is a {{prospective}} {{study of the}} clinical efficacy of the V. A. C. Granufoam Bridge Dressing {{for the treatment of}} diabetic foot ulcers. Materials and methods: Five consecutive patients with diabetic foot ulcers were treated with V. A. C. Granufoam Bridge Dressings and studied over a period of 22 &#x 2013; 48 days. The indications for treatment included diabetic patients with open ray amputation wounds and wounds post-drainage for abscess with exposed deep structures. Clinical outcome was measured in terms of reduction in wound dimensions, presence of wound granulation, microbial clearance, and development of wound complications. Results: Our results showed that with V. A. C. therapy, wound healing occurred in all patients. The number of dressings required ranged from 8 to 10. The baseline average wound size was 23. 1 cm 2. Wound areas shrunk by 18. 4 &#x 2013; 41. 7 %. All subjects achieved 100 % wound bed granulation with an average length of treatment of 33 days. Microbial clearance was achieved in all cases. All wounds healed by secondary intention in one case and four cases required split-thickness skin grafting. Conclusion: The V. A. C. Granufoam Bridge Dressing is effective in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. It promotes reduction of wound area, wound bed granulation, and microbial clearance.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 This master’s thesis {{describes}} {{the design process}} and testing results for a pneumatically actuated, manually-operated tool for confined space drilling operations. The purpose of this device is to back-drill pilot holes inside a commercial airplane wing. It is lightweight, and a “locator pin” enables the operator to align the drill over a pilot hole. A <b>suction</b> <b>pad</b> stabilizes the system, and an air motor and flexible drive shaft power the drill. Two testing procedures were performed to determine the practicality of this prototype. The first was the “offset drill test”, which qualified the exit hole position error due to an initial position error relative to the original pilot hole. The results displayed a linear relationship, and {{it was determined that}} position errors of less than. 060 ” would prevent the need for rework, with errors of up to. 030 ” considered acceptable. For the second test, a series of holes were drilled with the pneumatic tool and analyzed for position error, diameter range, and cycle time. The position errors and hole diameter range were within the allowed tolerances. The average cycle time was 45 seconds, 73 percent of which was for drilling the hole, and 27 percent of which was for positioning the device. Recommended improvements are discussed in the conclusion, and include a more durable flexible drive shaft, a damper for drill feed control, and a more stable locator pin...|$|E

40|$|Leaking {{in water}} pipe is a {{critical}} issue in Middle Eastern countries such as Kuwait where water is scarce. In-pipe robots can be dispatched to discover the network and inspect the inner surface of the pipe. This thesis describes the design and characterization of <b>suction</b> <b>pads</b> for in-pipe robots. The suction cups are made of hyperelastic materials that contain air channels inside. Instead of using conventional suction technique that is prone to leaking and loosing adhesion force, the suction cup is actuated by compressed air or liquid, which deforms the geometry of the cup to achieve suction. In order to verify the geometry changes during actuation, a uniaxial tension test was done on the elastic material used to acquire the material properties and the suction cup designs were then simulated using FEA in ABAQUS. Next, prototypes were designed in SolidWorks and fabricated using soft lithography techniques. To measure the suction force, pressure measurements were taken both inside the prototype channels and underneath the suction cup. Results show that a Positive Pressure Actuated Suction-cup (PPAS) of diameter forty millimeters can achieve suction force up to 68 N. As more air is inserted into PPAS, the suction force also increases. The concept {{has proved to be}} a feasible solution for pipe inspectio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{is devoted}} to {{computer}} simulation of electro-pneumatic drives for vertical motion mobile robots. These robots are equipped with <b>suction</b> <b>pads</b> to move on walls and ceiling. An output highlights a conflict between the main requirements to such robot drives: simultaneous ensuring of high speed and smoothness of movement of robots with a considerable mass of moved objects. The low efficiency of traditional cushion systems of cylinders is shown in development of such kind of robots. New structure of electro-pneumatic drive for applications with considerable inertia load is developed. This structure represents mechatronic system and consists from the set of on-off valves and computer control device that operates the valves and reaches the optimum motion control of the object with required smoothness. This could be achieved due to the multistep braking {{in the end of}} stroke. The paper also represents the mathematical model of developed drive with description of throttle elements, friction forces and details of computer control systems. Mathematical model realized in computer program allows to simulate processes of movement of electro-pneumatic drives. The results of computer modeling show that developed structure and multistep computer control allows to develop effective electro-pneumatic drives for high-quality and high-speed control of massive objects in the part of vertical motion mobile robots. Developed program represents effective analysis instrument, so it can be used in the process of design engineering...|$|R
40|$|Background: To expand {{minimally}} invasive beating-heart surgery, {{we have developed}} a miniature 2 -footed crawling robot (Heart-Lander) that navigates on the epicardium. This paradigm obviates mechanical stabilization and lung deflation, and avoids the access limitations of current approaches. We tested the locomotion of the device on a beating porcine heart accessed through a closed-chest subxiphoid approach. Methods: HeartLander consists of 2 modules that are connected by an extensible midsection. It adheres to the epicardium using <b>suction</b> <b>pads.</b> Locomotion and turning are accomplished by moving the 2 modules in an alternating fashion using wires that run through the midsection between them. After a preliminary test with a plastic beating-heart model, we performed a porcine study in vivo. The device was inserted into the pericardial space through a subxiphoid incision, while the test was observed using a left thoracoscopy. The blood pressure and electrocardiogram were monitored, and vacuum pressure and driving forces on the wires were recorded. Results: HeartLander traveled across the anterior and lateral surfaces of the beating heart without restriction, including locomotion forward, backward, and turning. The vacuum pressure was kept below 450 mm Hg at all times. The average maximum force during elongation was 1. 86 � 0. 97 N, and during retraction was 1. 24 � 0. 33 N. No adverse hemodynamic or electrophysiologic events were noted during the trial. No epicardial damage {{was found on the}} excised heart after the porcine trial.

40|$|The lobbies {{of hotels}} and banks, airport {{terminals}} and rail stations are often elegantly paved with polished natural stone, such as granite. While making a pleasant sight, glossy stone floors may become slippery when wet and dirt are brought in on peoples shoes. To prevent people slipping and injuring themselves, the natural stone floors of public buildings {{need to have}} a non-slip finish. The Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology IWS in Dresden have developed a laser process for this purpose, which does not deteriorate the gloss and color intensity to the tiled floor. Conventionally, polished stone floors are provided with a non-slip or anti-skid finish by a form of <b>suction</b> <b>pads,</b> increasing the friction between shoe soles and the floor. The laser process produces the same effect, but is environmentally harmless and not affected by external influences. The pulsed laser beam is guided by two scanner mirrors and a special optical co nfiguration, allowing the treatment to proceed at extremely high speed and with exceptional precision. The machine carves 8, 000 to 10, 000 micro-craters per second into the stone slabs. Different degrees of non-slip effect can be achieved by varying the dimensions of the indentations and the distance between them. Depending on the safety each 0. 3 to 0. 5 millimeters apart. Despite the roughened surface, cleaning the floor is just as easy as before. The process was successfully tested in 1997 with a stationary pilot device.

40|$|The Personal Vacuum Assisted Climber (PVAC) system {{built in}} 2012 by the Ascending Aggies at Utah State University, {{designed}} using vacuum motors to provide <b>suction</b> to <b>pads</b> {{to allow the}} user to climb various surfaces, needs to be further developed before being fully marketable. The current system {{does not have a}} user-friendly interface and is very loud (approx. 90 dB). These issues were addressed to answer the following question: how can the current PVAC system be optimized to decrease noise and produce a user friendly interface while maintaining current run time? To obtain the sound reduction desired it was decided to surround the motors with a hard plastic polystyrene case created by a vacuum forming process and then lined with sound-reducing convoluted foam. The motor exhaust was channeled through a single muffler out of the bottom of the case. This resulted in a sound reduction of over 20 decibels. The power system was improved with a new choice of 36 volt motors which could each be run off of only four batteries or an ac power supply through an inverter. The batteries used in this system increased run time by 50 % and decreased the overall weight of the system by 8 lbs. This choice of motors was found to supply in excess the needed suction to support a 300 lb person. A Pulse Width modulator was also installed to provide a control on Voltage output of the batteries to optimize the run time. An electrical board controller was designed and installed to improve the user interface with an LED display on the pads of the system showing the remaining battery voltage and motor temperature...|$|R
