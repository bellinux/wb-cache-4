40|$|Due to its low lying properties, {{surface water}} in Goeree-Overflakkee (GO) {{is under the}} {{influence}} of saline seepage. Seepage enters the surface water directly and indirectly via tile drainage systems. Drain tiles salinities were sampled in four sites during spring in order to find spatial features which can be used to predict effluent salinity in response to precipitation events. From literature, important identified factors were <b>seepage</b> <b>intensity,</b> drainage depth, drainage area per tile and precipitation-evaporation surplus. A shortage in precipitation caused insignificant results in temporal variability in the measurements, making it impossible to quantify changes in salinity. However, drain tiles and measurement sites were significantly different suggesting an effect of spatial features to drainage salinity. <b>Seepage</b> <b>intensity</b> was identified as the only significant factor for causing differences between sites (large scale variability). A validation attempt to test the model to surface water concentrations in GO did not result in a good prediction, leaving room for future research. For variation between drain tiles, small scale variability, two mechanisms can be identified 1) boils are suspected to cause small scale spatial differences in <b>seepage</b> <b>intensities,</b> 2) cracks in the soils are thought to cause preferential flow in the rain water lens, resulting in drain tile specific mixture ratios of seepage, RW-lens water and precipitation. These ratios can cause drain tiles to respond differently to incoming precipitation and contribute to drain tile specific salinities. A spatial analysis into the salinities of surface water monitoring points did not result in identifying important factors. Future research should focus in area specific monitoring of the salinity response per area. This can give detailed information about the specific precipitation responses and can help with managing water quality according the WFD. For future research, a longer period is necessary to investigate precipitation responses in detail...|$|R

40|$|Wafer bonding {{describes}} all {{technologies for}} joining {{two or more}} substrates directly or using certain intermediate layers. Current investigations are focused on so-called low temperature bonding as a special direct bonding technology. It is carried out without intermediate layers and at temperatures below 400 °C. In addition to the wafer materials, the toughness of the bonded interface also depends on the bonding process itself. It can vary for different pre-treatments. Furthermore, an increase of the annealing temperature leads to a higher toughness of the bonded interface. The fracture toughness is a suitable value to describe the damage behaviour of the bonded interface. Based on a micro-chevron-specimen, the fracture toughness can be determined either numerically or by combining numerical analysis with experimental measurement of the maximum force. The maximum force is measured during a micro-chevron-test using a Mode I loading. The minimum of the stress <b>intensity</b> <b>coefficient</b> can be determined by a FE-simulation only. One possibility to estimate the stress <b>intensity</b> <b>coefficient</b> is the compliance method. The compliance of the whole specimen increases with a growing crack. The stress <b>intensity</b> <b>coefficient</b> can be directly derived from the simulated compliance and the crack length itself.

40|$|Authigenic {{carbonate}} rocks from {{an active}} seep (Site F) {{located in the}} South China Sea (SCS) at a water depth of 1120 m were studied using mineralogical and lipid biomarker analyses. Carbonate mineral compositions, in specific samples, were predominantly aragonite, high-Mg calcite (HMC), or a mixture of both. Abundant C- 13 -depleted lipid biomarkers diagnostic for archaea provide evidence that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), mediated by anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea (ANME) and their bacterial partners, are the major processes leading to formation of the carbonates. High Methane Index, dominance of ANME- 2 assemblages and the predominant contribution of AOM-related biomarkers in the aragonitic carbonate point to the strong impact of AOM communities during its precipitation, which is likely caused by high <b>seepage</b> <b>intensities.</b> The relatively low Methane Index and abundant allochthonous input of the HMC carbonate {{are a result of}} the weak impact of AOM microbial communities under conditions of low methane seepage. Evidence for this interpretation also comes from relatively higher carbonate content, lesser contribution of allochthonous organic matter and lower pyrite content in the aragonitic carbonate than in the HMC carbonate. High concentrations of C- 13 -depleted hopanoids were observed in the aragonitic sample which may be a result of the intermittent presence of oxic conditions in an overall anoxic condition, possibly induced by changing <b>seepage</b> <b>intensities.</b> Our data suggests that lipid biomarkers in authigenic carbonate from seep sites can be helpful for improving assessments of the fluid dynamics in such a complex system.

However, {{due to the lack}} of seepage data on an appropriate spatial scale, no quantitative relationships have been established as yet between seepage and the occurrence of seepage-dependent plant communities. Since there is no established method to directly measure upward seepage in the field, we investigated the possibility of inferring the <b>seepage</b> <b>intensity</b> by using measurable hydrological quantities such as ground and surface-water levels. To this end, we designed 16 representative plots of virtual hydrological situations, using known sets of geohydrological parameters. Then we applied the integrated soil-water-atmosphere-plant model SWAP to generate 'measured' time series of ground and surface-water levels for these plots. Finally, using the SCEM-UA optimisation algorithm, we calibrated parameters that affect seepage onto these time series. We analysed how the accuracy and uncertainty of calibrated seepage fluxes depend on the measurement interval of input data and on the accuracy and uncertainty of inferred local geohydrological parameters and boundary conditions. Our analysis shows that it is possible to make reliable estimates of <b>seepage</b> <b>intensities</b> from data provided by easy to place piezometers and water level gauges. For application on real datasets, the analysis gives insight into the limitations of both the approach and the data requirements. For example, data supplied every fortnight was found to be just as valuable for seepage estimation as modern high frequency measurements.

30|$|Carbon {{emissions}} in the model are treated as proportional to the energy inputs used and/or {{to the level of}} activity. Based on the carbon emissions accounting published by the Australian Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, the model treats carbon {{emissions in}} three different ways. First, fuel combustion emissions are tied with inputs (the amount of fuel used on-site). Based on the emissions data, the input emission intensity—the amount of emissions per dollar of inputs (fuels)—is calculated as a coefficient, and then the model computes emissions by multiplying the amount of input used by the emission intensity. Second, industry ‘activity’ emissions (these are on-site ancillary activities such as gas emitted while making cement, on-site waste disposal, etc.) are tied to the output of the industry. The activity emission <b>intensity</b> <b>coefficient</b> is also pre-calculated from the emission matrix, and it is multiplied by the industry output to obtain the activity emissions by the industry. Third, the activity emissions by the household sector are tied with the total consumption of the household sector. The total consumption emissions are obtained by the amount of household consumption times the consumption emission <b>intensity</b> <b>coefficient</b> pre-calculated from the emission matrix. All three types of emission intensity are assumed fixed in the model to reflect unchanged technology and household preferences in the short term. For the purposes of undertaking the border adjustment simulations, it was necessary to calculate emissions {{associated with the use of}} electricity generated offsite.
