40|$|We {{consider}} a one-dimensional cutting stock problem (CSP) {{in which the}} <b>stock</b> <b>widths</b> {{are not used to}} fulfill the order but kept for use in the future for the industrial-use paper production. We present a new model based on the flexible stock allocation and trim loss control to determine the production quantity. We evaluate our approach using a real data and show that we are able to solve industrial-size problems, while also addressing common cutting considerations such as aggregation of orders, multiple <b>stock</b> <b>widths,</b> and cutting different patterns on the same machine. In addition, we compare our model with others, including trim loss minimization problem (TLMP) and cutting stock problem (CSP). The results show that the proposed model outperforms the other two models regarding total flexibility and trim loss ratio...|$|R

Cellulose nitrate {{was the first}} type of film base used to record motion pictures, but due to its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials. <b>Stock</b> <b>widths</b> and the film format for images on the reel have had a rich history, though most large commercial films are still shot on (and distributed to theaters) as 35 mm prints.Originally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds using hand-cranked cameras and projectors; though 1000 frames per minute (16⅔ frame/s) is generally cited as a standard silent speed, research indicates most films were shot between 16 frame/s and 23 frame/s and projected from 18 frame/s on up (often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown). When sound film {{was introduced in the}} late 1920s, a constant speed was required for the sound head. 24 frames per second were chosen because it was the slowest (and thus cheapest) speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality. Improvements since the late 19th century include the mechanization of cameras - allowing them to record at a consistent speed, quiet camera design - allowing sound recorded on-set to be usable without requiring large [...] "blimps" [...] to encase the camera, the invention of more sophisticated filmstocks and lenses, allowing directors to film in increasingly dim conditions, and the development of synchronized sound, allowing sound to be recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action. The soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting the film, but for live-action pictures, many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously.|$|R

This formula takes into account the ratio of the <b>width</b> of the <b>stock</b> to the length of the arc of contact during rolling, the ratio of the roll radius to thickness of the <b>stock,</b> the <b>width</b> to thickness ratio of the stock and the draft [or reduction). 1 % modified formula has also been devised to take into account Rot only the geometrical variables but also changes in rolling temperature, steel composition, roll and bar surface condition, and speed of rolling (strain rate) ...|$|R

30|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} scenarios {{in which the}} main cutting function can be called. In every run, one of these cases occurs. The first case is when the free space {{is equal to the}} raw stock (W,L) size. From the second iteration and after the cutting procedure, there will be two remainder strips from the <b>stock.</b> The <b>width</b> and length of the upper strip are represented by WRS and LRS, respectively. In every cycle, newly generated strips are placed {{on the top of the}} stack, which forms the second scenario. Conversely, the lower strips are used to produce new items in the third scenario. They will be used until there are no more feasible cuts, which lead to waste items. Then, the control flow will change to the stack items and the pop function will be called. The cutting algorithm continues to run until the control flow reaches the waste items. In a situation where there are no strips and the stack is empty, a new raw stock will be used. The above algorithm has been implemented using the C++ language.|$|R
40|$|The {{goals for}} a wide range of forest {{management}} objectives are often stated in terms of the amount and layering of canopy cover. However, measuring canopy cover is labor intensive and different techniques provide widely different estimates. Several approaches have been developed to predict cover from common tree or stand-level density attributes, with varying results. This study used line-intercept measured tree cover from 1, 424 Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots across Oregon to build predictive models from estimates of tree <b>stocking,</b> crown <b>width,</b> and other stand attributes (mean diameter, stand height, SDI, etc.). A variety of adjustments were applied to adjust for tree social status and account for tree crown overlap. Stocking was a better predictor of cover than crown width, although much of the error in the latter was due to estimates of crown overlap. The random crown overlap function that is standard in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) resulted in biased predictions in mesic forest types, but not in dry forest types. New model predictions based on stocking for mesic forest types were within 15 percent of measured cover for 3 ̆e 82...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine how final stocking influences tree growth and radial and longitudinal variation in wood properties at a Pinus radiata D. Don plantation located at one of the warmest forest sites in New Zealand, Forsyth Downs forest in Northland. This thesis addressed both the effect of stocking on stand basal area, height, diameter and branch diameter and the effect of stocking on wood properties microfibril angle (MFA), module of elasticity and density. Finally, how ring width influences wood properties and whether this variable accounts for the treatment effects was investigated. Stocking, height and ring number and all interactions between these variables significantly affected ring width. Ring width by itself was significant as a predictor of density, but when it was combined with other class level variables it was insignificant (i. e. does not account for treatment effects), and it did not add anything to a model with only class effects. There was a significant impact of ring number on density while ring width was insignificant in the same model. MFA was significantly affected by ring width, height and ring number in the tree, and all interactions, apart from the three way interaction, but not by <b>stocking.</b> Ring <b>width</b> was significant in the MFA model both by itself and when it was combined with other variables. Ring width accounted for the stocking effect. The best model of MOE included the class level effects of stocking, height and ring number within the tree, and all interactions between these variables, and ring width, as a continuous variable. While there was a significant effect between stockings this was relatively weak compared to the other main effects. Ring width largely accounted for the effect of stocking, but not that of ring number, or height...|$|R
40|$|Apex predators play a {{key role}} in {{ecosystem}} stability across environments but their numbers in general are decreasing. By contrast, European catfish (Silurus glanis), the European freshwater apex predator, is on the increase. However, studies concerning apex predators in freshwaters are scarce in comparison to those in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The present study combines stomach content and stable isotope analyses with diet preferences of catfish to reveal its impact on the ecosystem since <b>stocking.</b> Catfish niche <b>width</b> is extremely wide in comparison to the typical model predator, Northern pike (Esox lucius). Catfish and pike have different individual dietary specialization that results in different functional roles in coupling or compartmentalizing distinct food webs. The role of both species in the ecosystem is irreplaceable due to multiple predator effects. The impact of catfish is apparent across the entire aquatic ecosystem, but herbivores are the most affected ecological group. The key feature of catfish, and probably a common feature of apex predators in general, is utilization of several dietary strategies by individuals within a population: long-term generalism or specialization and also shortterm specialization. Catfish, similar to other large-bodied apex predators, have two typical features: enormous generalism and adaptability to new prey sources...|$|R

The RWs varied between 6. 41 ± 2. 15 µm for G. longicalyx to 17. 45 ± 2. 98 µm for the G. hirsutum parent cultivar C 2. Fibers produced by the trispecific hybrids and their progeny were finer than the bispecific hybrid material. For the introgressed stocks, the lowest RWs were observed for the trispecific hybrid (10. 79 ± 2. 14 µm) and certain backcross progenies (between 11. 98 ± 1. 27 µm to 12. 71 ± 1. 61 µm). The allohexaploid RW was 13. 58 ± 1. 41 µm. One of its tetraploid progeny produced approximately the same value (13. 94 ± 2. 48 µm). These results show that G. longicalyx is a potential genetic stock for cotton fiber fineness improvement. The genetic stocks produced are valuable materials for improve the fineness of cotton fiber.

40|$|Exclosures {{have been}} widely {{implemented}} in north Ethiopia {{in the last few}} decades for rehabilitation of degraded areas. Despite decades of establishment, the effectiveness of exclosures is constrained by lack of adequate management such as supplementing additional water to the rain water which is characterized as short and erratic. There is no knowledge on the response of vegetation to such additional water application. This study is aimed to evaluate the effects of spate irrigation on species diversity, <b>stocking</b> and ring <b>width</b> growth of trees in exclosures. Two exclosures (May Ba’ati and Adi Kolakol), Dogu’aTemben district, north Ethiopia, were used for this study. 55. Each exclosure was divided in two blocks (irrigated and control) to allow comparison of vegetation growth. May Ba’ti was irrigated in 2005 while Adi Kolakol was irrigated from 2012 – 2016 but monitored by the researchers from 2014 to 2016. The amount of irrigation water applied is in the same order of magnitude as the direct rainfall on the site. Different species diversity indices and mean tree ring width growth were used to compare the irrigated and non-irrigated areas. The result showed that trees in irrigated block have larger species richness, Shannon Wiener diversity index, tree density per ha, abundance, evenness and basal area than in the control area. The changes of these indices were negative in years with a short rainy season in the control area, whereas most indices remain positive under irrigated area. Moreover, tree ring width growth analysis exhibits the role of additional water to vegetation growth. The result of this study indicates diverting runoff to exclosures results in 15 % to 22 % increase in ring width as compared to non-irrigated trees. In addition, there is strong abstraction of storm runoff in gullies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for solving a new real problem in cutting and packing. At its core is an innovative mixed integer programme model that places irregular pieces and defines guillotine cuts. The two-dimensional irregular shape bin packing problem with guillotine constraints arises {{in the glass}} cutting industry, for example, the cutting of glass for conservatories. Almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal {{to the edges of}} the stock sheet and a maximum of two angles of rotation are permitted. The literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i. e. minimizing the length of a single fixed <b>width</b> <b>stock</b> sheet, and does not consider guillotine cuts. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that are not always orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins. To our knowledge only one other recent paper tackles this problem. We present a hybrid algorithm that is a constructive heuristic that determines the relative position of pieces in the bin and guillotine constraints via a mixed integer programme model. We investigate two approaches for allocating guillotine cuts {{at the same time as}} determining the placement of the piece, and a two phase approach that delays the allocation of cuts to provide flexibility in space usage. Finally we describe an improvement procedure that is applied to each bin before it is closed. This approach improves on the results of the only other publication on this problem, and gives competitive results for the classic rectangle bin packing problem with guillotine constraint...|$|R
