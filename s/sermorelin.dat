50|$|<b>Sermorelin</b> (INN) (brand names Geref, Gerel), {{also known}} as GHRH (1-29), is a peptide {{analogue}} of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) which {{is used as a}} diagnostic agent to assess growth hormone (GH) secretion for the purpose of diagnosing growth hormone deficiency. It is a 29-amino acid polypeptide representing the 1-29 fragment from endogenous human GHRH, thought to be the shortest fully functional fragment of GHRH.|$|E
50|$|Modified GRF (1-29) often {{abbreviated}} as mod GRF (1-29), originally {{known as}} tetrasubstitued GRF (1-29), {{is a term}} used to identify a 29 amino acid peptide analogue of growth-hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), a releasing hormone of growth hormone (GH). It is {{a modified version of}} the shortest fully functional fragment of GHRH, often referred to as growth hormone releasing factor (1-29) (abbreviated as GRF (1-29)), and also known by its standardized name, <b>sermorelin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many GHRH analogs remain {{primarily}} research chemicals, {{although some}} have specific applications. <b>Sermorelin,</b> a functional peptide fragment of GHRH, {{has been used}} in the diagnosis of deficiencies in growth hormone secretion. [...] Tesamorelin, under the trade name Egrifta, received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2010 for the treatment of lipodystrophy in HIV patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy, and, in 2011, was investigated for effects on certain cognitive tests in the elderly. As a category, the use of GHRH analogs by professional athletes may be prohibited by restrictions on doping in sport because they act as growth hormone secretagogues.|$|E
50|$|Growth hormone secretagogues (GSHs) are a {{class of}} drugs which act as secretagogues (i.e., induce the secretion) of growth hormone (GH). They include {{agonists}} of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), such as ghrelin (lenomorelin), pralmorelin (GHRP-2), GHRP-6, examorelin (hexarelin), ipamorelin, and ibutamoren (MK-677), and agonists of the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR), such as growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) (somatorelin), CJC-1295, <b>sermorelin,</b> and tesamorelin. Many also induce the secretion of {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1), as well as of other hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as prolactin and cortisol. The main clinical application of these agents is the treatment of growth hormone deficiency. They also see black market use, similarly to anabolic steroids, for bodybuilding purposes.|$|E
40|$|To study {{regulation}} of the secretion of human pituitary GH (hGH) and placental GH (hPGH) in the pregnant woman and human fetus, the GH-releasing factor <b>Sermorelin</b> [GRF-(l– 29) -NH 2] was administered to pregnant women at term (n = 5), just before elective cesarean section; saline was administered in control studies (n = 5). The effects of GRF-(1 – 29) -NH 2 administration on maternal and fetal serum concentrations of hGH and GRF-(l– 29) -NH 2 and maternal serum levels of hPGH were evaluated at birth. The mean time span between injection and birth was 20 min (range, 15 – 25 min). Cord serum hGH concentrations were similar in infants of GRF-(1 – 29) -NH 2 -injected mothers and control infants. GRF-(l– 29) -NH 2 elicited a consistent but small rise in maternal hGH serum concentrations (P = 0. 08), whereas hPGH concentrations remained unaltered. Finally, GRF-(l– 29) -NH 2 concentrations were undetectable in cord serum, but readily detectable in concomitantly obtained maternal serum. In conclusion, {{these data suggest that}} hGH secretion in the pregnant woman at term is suppressed at the pituitary level, that GRF does not affect hPGH secretion, and that fetal hGH secretion is independent of circulating maternal GRF, probably because of lack of transplacental GRF passage.

40|$|Synthetically {{produced}} GRF 1 – 29 (<b>Sermorelin)</b> has an {{amino acid}} composition {{identical to the}} N-terminal 29 amino acids sequence of the natural hypothalamic GHRH 1 – 44 (Figure 1). It maintains bioactivity in vitro and is almost equally effective in eliciting secretion of endogenous growth hormone in vivo. The main drawbacks associated with the pharmaceutical use of hGRF 1 – 29 relate to its short half-life in plasma, about 10 – 20 min in humans, which is caused mostly by renal ultrafiltration and enzymatic degradation at the N terminus. PEGylation has been considered as one valid approach to obtain more stable forms of the peptide, with a longer in vivo half-life and ultimately with increased pharmacodynamic response along the somatotropic axis (endogenous GH, IGF- 1 levels). Different PEGylated GRF conjugates were obtained and their bioactivity was tested in vitro and in vivo by monitoring endogenous growth hormone (GH) serum levels after intravenous (i. v.) injection in rats, and intravenous and subcutaneous (s. c.) injection in pigs. It was found that GRF–PEG conjugates are able to bind and activate the human GRF receptor, although with different potency. The effect of PEG molecular weight, number of PEG chains bound and position of PEGylation site on GRF activity were investigated. Mono-PEGylated isomers with a PEG 5000 polymer chain linked to Lys 12 or Lys 21 residues, showed high biological activity in vitro, {{which is similar to}} that of hGRF 1 – 29,and a higher pharmacodynamic response as compared to unmodified GRF molecule...|$|E
