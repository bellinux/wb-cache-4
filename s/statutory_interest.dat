25|$|Prior to 2009 {{regulation}} of consumer credit was primarily {{conducted by the}} states and territories. Some states such as New South Wales and Queensland legislated effective annual interest rate caps of 48%. In 2008 the Australian states and territories referred powers of consumer credit to the Commonwealth. In 2009 the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (Cth) was introduced, which initially treated payday lenders no differently from all other lenders. In 2013 Parliament tightened regulation on the payday lending further introducing the Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Act 2012 (Cth) which imposed an effective APR cap of 48% for all consumer credit contracts (inclusive of all fees and charges). Payday lenders who provided a loan falling within {{the definition of a}} small amount credit contract (SACC), defined as a contract provided by a non authorised-deposit taking institution for less than $2,000 for a term between 16 days and 1 year, are permitted to charge a 20% establishment fee in addition to monthly (or part thereof) fee of 4% (effective 48% p.a.). Payday lenders who provide a loan falling within the definition of a medium amount credit contract (MACC), defined as a credit contract provided by a non-deposit taking institution for between $2,000–$5,000 may charge a $400 establishment fee in addition to the <b>statutory</b> <b>interest</b> rate cap of 48%. Payday lenders are still required to comply with Responsible lending obligations applying to all creditors. Unlike other jurisdictions Australian payday lenders providing SACC or MACC products are not required to display their fees as an effective annual interest rate percentage.|$|E

Secondly, this paper argues that Wik [Wik Peoples v Queensland], the judicial precursor of the approach in Ward, should be overruled. Significant parts of the reasoning in Wik, when closely examined, are either flawed in their own right or no longer make sense after Ward and Wilson; and the rationale for adhering to the decision is weak...|$|R

Western United States water law, based on the prior appropriation doctrine, has always promoted maximizing ‘beneficial use’ of the resource and has effectively protected water allocations for traditional purposes. Public water uses also enjoy some legal protection, but it exists mostly on paper; in practice, neither <b>statutory</b> public <b>interest</b> provisions nor the non-statutory public trust doctrine has been widely effective.

5000|$|In the United States, it {{is common}} to require key money {{in the form of a}} {{security}} deposit. The tenant pays one or two months' rent up-front.

It is illegal but common for unscrupulous landlords to refuse to refund some or all of this deposit, instead keeping it for unneeded [...] "cleaning" [...] or [...] "repairs."

Under r 8 of the 1994 Reg’s (now r 12) the DG sought an injunction to stop the bank using the term, because it was unfair. Lord Goodhart submitted that the term merely concerned the adequacy of the bank’s remuneration, therefore fell under r 3(2) (now r 6(2)).

40|$|Under {{consultation}} arrangements introduced from 1 st October 1974, the Forestry Commission {{seeks the}} views of <b>interested</b> <b>statutory</b> bodies before proceeding with afforestation on its own account, or before agreeing to grant-aid private proposals.

The importance of correct referral decisions is clear. In this paper the theoretical basis of partial consultation is explored, the extent of referral and of comment being related to the foresters' understanding of the consultee's requirements. Data from North Scotland are examined, and questions raised concerning the adequacy of current consultation practice with environmental interest groups. ...|$|R
40|$|No {{one theory}} or {{school of thought}} {{consistently}} dominates judicial application of statutes, but the basic methodology employed by courts seems well-established if not always well-defined. Most mainstream judges and lawyers faced with a statutory construction task will look at (although with varying emphasis) {{the text of the}} statute, the legislative history of the provision, the context of the enactment, evident congressional purpose, and applicable agency interpretations, often employing the canons of construction for assistance. Although orthodox judicial thought suggests that the judge 2 ̆ 7 s role is confined to discerning textual meaning or directives of the enacting legislature, courts also often examine subsequent legal developments and the overall legal terrain in rendering an interpretation. Despite general similarities, lawyers, judges, and scholars continue to debate the supreme construct for statutory interpretation, although the parameters of the various schools are often blurred. Adherence to particular approaches seems to vary with the results desired. Amid the debated and shifting positions, several distinct approaches emerge: textualism, intentionalism, purposivism, dynamism, and eclectic pragmatism. The most established schools of interpretative thought are textualism, intentionalism, and purposivism.
