25|$|Building {{blocks that}} make up the network of CMPs must contain an {{aromatic}} system and have at least two reactive groups. To generate the porous structure of CMPs, cross-coupling of building blocks with different geometries to create a 3-D polymer backbone is necessary, while <b>self-condensation</b> reactions occur in the homo-coupling of building blocks with similar geometry.

25|$|When an acid {{catalyst}} is used, {{the initial}} {{step in the}} reaction mechanism involves acid-catalyzed tautomerization of the carbonyl compound to the enol. The acid also serves to activate the carbonyl group of another molecule by protonation, rendering it highly electrophilic. The enol is nucleophilic at the α-carbon, allowing it to attack the protonated carbonyl compound, leading to the aldol after deprotonation. This usually dehydrates to give the unsaturated carbonyl compound. The scheme shows a typical acid-catalyzed <b>self-condensation</b> of an aldehyde.|$|E

By comparison of the kinetics of <b>self-condensations</b> of HMPs, NaHCO 3 was proved to increase the reactivity of para-hydroxymethyl groups. The changes of 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts on each HMP system with the additive indicated that the addition of NaHCO 3 enhanced some molecular interactions between HMPs and NaHCO 3, facilitating a resonance effect that might play a similar role in dissociation of the phenolic hydroxyl groups of HMPs.

50|$|Boronic acid <b>self-{{condensation}}</b> or condensation with diols is a well-documented dynamic covalent reaction. The boronic acid condensation has {{the characteristic}} of forming two dynamic bonds with various substrates. This is advantageous when designing systems where high rigidity is desired, such as 3-D cages and COFs.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{process can}} also be used to prevent <b>self-{{condensation}}</b> between two ketones. In this case, however, the base used needs to be more powerful. A common base used is Lithium diisopropyl amide (LDA). Here it is used in order to perform the crossed condensation between acetone and cyclohexanone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Self-condensation</b> is {{an organic}} {{reaction}} {{in which a}} chemical compound containing a carbonyl group acts both as the electrophile and the nucleophile in an aldol condensation. It is also called a symmetrical aldol condensation {{as opposed to a}} mixed aldol condensation in which the electrophile and nucleophile are different species.|$|E
50|$|Chain growth {{polycondensation}} polymerizations {{were initially}} developed under {{the premise that}} a change in substituent effects of the polymer, relative to the monomer, causes the polymers end group to be more reactive this {{has been referred to}} as “reactive intermediate polycondensation”. The essential result is monomers preferentially react with the activated polymer end groups over reactions with other monomers. This preferred reactivity is the fundamental difference when categorizing a polymerization mechanism as chain-growth as opposed to step-growth in which the monomer and polymer chain end group have equal reactivity (the reactivity is uncontrolled). Several strategies were employed to minimize monomer-monomer reactions (or <b>self-condensation)</b> and polymerizations with low D and controllable Mn have been attained by this mechanism for small molecular weight polymers. However, for high molecular weight polymer chains (i.e. small initiator to monomer ratio) the Mn is not easily to controlled, for some monomers, since <b>self-condensation</b> between monomers occurred more frequently due to the low propagating species concentration.|$|E
50|$|For this {{reaction}} {{to occur in}} liquid phase mostly the catalyst magnesium aluminium double oxide is used. The magnesium aluminium double oxide has the following formula: Mg1-x Alx O1+x. Obtaining this molecule requires a, for example calcining hydrotalcites at temperatures lower than 800 °C. For the synthesis of isophorone to occur at vapor phase, the <b>self-condensation</b> reaction of acetone is carried out at temperatures above 200 °C.|$|E
50|$|The Mukaiyama aldol {{addition}} is {{an organic}} reaction and {{a type of}} aldol reaction between a silyl enol ether and an aldehyde or formate. The reaction was discovered by Teruaki Mukaiyama (born 1927) in 1973. His choice of reactants allows for a crossed aldol reaction between an aldehyde and a ketone or a different aldehyde without <b>self-condensation</b> of the aldehyde. For this reason the reaction is used extensively in organic synthesis.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{drawbacks}} of the Henry Reaction {{is the potential for}} side reactions throughout the course of the reaction. Aside from the reversibility of the reaction (Retro-Henry) which could prevent the reaction from proceeding, the β-nitro alcohol has the potential to undergo dehydration, and for sterically hindered substrates it is possible that a base catalyzed <b>self-condensation</b> (Cannizaro reaction) could occur. A general scheme of the Cannizzaro reaction is depicted below.|$|E
50|$|Benzocfluorene occurs {{naturally}} in tar, {{but can also}} be manually synthesized in a four step process, which is depicted in the picture below. The starting product is indanone (1). This is brominated in a substitution reaction to 3-bromoindanone (2) using the reagent N-bromosuccinimide. This substance is dehydrobrominated to 2H-inden-1-one (3) using the reagent triethylamine. Benzocfluorenone-9 (4) is generated by <b>self-condensation</b> of 2H-inden-1-one, when heated. The final step is reduction of this compound with hydrazine hydrate, generating benzocfluorene (5).|$|E

50|$|Using LDA {{will not}} work when {{attempting}} to make enolate ion from aldehydes. They are so reactive that <b>self-condensation</b> will occur. One {{way to get around}} this is to turn the aldehyde into a silyl enol ether using trimethylsilyl chloride and a base, such as triethylamine, and then perform the aldol condensation. Here this tactic is employed in the condensation of acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde. A Lewis acid, such as TiCl4, must be used in order to promote condensation.|$|E

50|$|Imidoyl {{chlorides}} can {{be difficult}} to handle. Imidoyl chlorides react readily with water, which makes any attempt to isolate and store them {{for long periods of time}} difficult. Further, imidoyl chlorides tend to undergo <b>self-condensation</b> at higher temperatures if the imidoyl chloride has an α CH group. At even higher temperatures, the chlorine of the imidoyl chloride tends to be eliminated, leaving the nitrile. Because of these complications, imidoyl chlorides are typically prepared and used immediately. More stable intermediates are being sought, with substances such as imidoylbenzotriazoles being suggested.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the mid-1960s}} there are methods to {{stabilize}} cyanamide {{in order to}} make it available on an industrial scale. Due to the strong affinity towards <b>self-condensation</b> in alkaline media (see above) solutions of cyanamide are stabilized by the addition of 0.5 wt% of monosodium phosphate as buffer. Solid cyanamide is produced by careful evaporation of the solvent and subsequent addition of a hydrolysis labil ester of methanoic acid. The ester absorbs traces of moisture (suppression of urea formation), neutralizes alkalinity (ammonia) and continually releases small amounts of methanoic acid.|$|E
50|$|The {{major problem}} {{associated}} with alkylation reactions employing nitrile anions is over-alkylation. In the alkylation of acetonitrile, for instance, yields of monoalkylated product {{are low in}} most cases. Two exceptions are alkylations with epoxides (the nearby negative charge of the opened epoxide wards off further alkylation) and alkylations with cyanomethylcopper(I) species. Side reactions may also present a problem; concentrations of the nitrile anion must be high to mitigate processes involving <b>self-condensation,</b> such as the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction. Other important side reactions include elimination of the alkyl cyanide product or alkyl halide starting material and amidine formation.|$|E
50|$|Isophorone is not {{naturally}} available. Various {{techniques are}} available for obtaining isophorone. The most common and used method includes an <b>self-condensation</b> of acetone with KOH. For this reaction a dehydrogenated acetone allows {{one of the side}} faced carbon atoms to attack the central carbon atom (the carbonyl carbon) of another acetone molecule. Hereby a diacetone alcohol (4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-one)(1) forms. A follow up dehydration reaction of diacetone alcohol yields (mesityl oxide)(2) and the rest product, water. Dehydrogenated acetone is then able to further react via an addition reaction with mesityl oxide (Michael reaction) to 4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxoheptan-1-ide (3), which successively attacks its own carbonyl carbon to form 3-hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexan-1-one(4). Finally a dehydration reaction of 3-hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexan-1-one forms isophorone.|$|E
50|$|In his {{profession}} Borodin gained great respect, being particularly noted {{for his work}} on aldehydes. Between 1859 and 1862 Borodin held a postdoctorate in Heidelberg. He worked in the laboratory of Emil Erlenmeyer working on benzene derivatives. He also spent time in Pisa, working on halocarbons. One experiment published in 1862 described the first nucleophilic displacement of chlorine by fluorine in benzoyl chloride. A related reaction known to the West as the Hunsdiecker reaction published in 1939 by the Hunsdieckers was promoted by the Soviet Union as the Borodin reaction. In 1862 he returned to the Medical-Surgical Academy, taking up a chair in chemistry, where he worked on <b>self-condensation</b> of small aldehydes. He published papers in 1864 and 1869, and in this field he found himself competing with August Kekulé.|$|E
5000|$|Once the [...] "nucleophilic aldehyde" [...] synthon is formed, {{whether as}} a cyanohydrin or {{stabilized}} by a thiazolium ylide, the reaction can proceed down two pathways. The faster pathway is <b>self-condensation</b> with another molecule of aldehyde to give benzoin products. However, benzoin condensation is completely reversible, and therefore does {{not interfere with}} product formation in the Stetter reaction. In fact, benzoins can be used instead of aldehydes as substrates {{to achieve the same}} overall Stetter transformation, because benzoins can be restored to their aldehyde precursors under the reaction conditions. The desired pathway toward the Stetter product is the 1,4-addition of the nucleophilic aldehyde to a Michael-type acceptor. After 1,4-addition, the reaction is irreversible and ultimately, the 1,4-dicarbonyl is formed when the catalyst is kicked out to regenerate CN− or the thiazolium ylide.|$|E
