The review consists <b>of</b> short <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> key academic <b>texts,</b> <b>reports</b> and policy documents that may be useful in the rethinking of the subject offerings under the banner of the Arts. The concentration of citations included in this literature review is situated in the last fourteen years of investigation into arts and education from the years 2000 to 2014. The review begins with a <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> key considerations arising from the literature that may be taken into account when redeveloping SAS syllabi in the arts subject areas. Immediately following the summary is the review of literature captured under the following headings – role of the arts in educational contexts, arts engagement, learners & achievement, content, teaching and learning approaches, skills for the 21 st century workforce, national and international syllabus directions...|$|R

40|$|Information Summarization {{is one of}} the key {{challenges}} for current and future information systems. In this paper, we will outline a system that comprises modules for summarizing texts and time series to study the link between the two. <b>Summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> are generated using a lexical analysis <b>of</b> cohesion in <b>texts</b> focusing on key sentences that provide cohesion: by implication, these are the sentences that comprise chief points <b>of</b> a given <b>text.</b> Time series summarization is accomplished using the so-called wavelet analysis to separate out the trend, cyclical fluctuations and autocorrelational effects and generating verbal signals to describe each phenomenon. Finally, we present a case study performed on the UK financial market with regards to multimodal information processing, namely textual and numerical summarization. ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the design of}} a flexible summarization system consisting of several independent linguistic processing tools that can be rapidly configured and extensively parameterized. Summarization will begin with segmentation <b>of</b> the <b>text</b> at places where there is a probable topic change.

Finally, summary sentences will be extracted from the most relevant segments rather than the whole text. 1 1 Introduction The Text Summarization (TS) part of the Intelligent Information Access (IIA) project (Lankester et al., 1998) aims at generating <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> along the following dimensions: ffl query-based summarization rather than generic summarization, ffl indicative summaries rather than informative summaries, ffl single rather than multiple documents, and ffl extraction rather than abstraction.
