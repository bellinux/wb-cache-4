5|$|On January 6, 2016, Johnson {{declared}} that he would seek the Libertarian nomination for the presidency. On May 18, Johnson named former Massachusetts Governor William Weld as his running mate. On May 29, 2016, Johnson received the Libertarian nomination on the <b>second</b> <b>ballot.</b> Johnson was {{on the ballot in}} all 50 states.|$|E
5|$|The Republican Convention {{was held}} on June 10–12, 1924, in Cleveland, Ohio; Coolidge was {{nominated}} on the first ballot. The convention nominated Frank Lowden of Illinois for vice president on the <b>second</b> <b>ballot,</b> but he declined; former Brigadier General Charles G. Dawes was nominated on the third ballot and accepted.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>second</b> <b>balloting,</b> Jindal {{faced the}} {{outgoing}} lieutenant governor, Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Lafayette, a Democrat. Despite winning in Blanco's hometown, he lost many normally conservative parishes in north Louisiana, and Blanco prevailed with 52 {{percent of the}} popular vote.|$|R
25|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Brown could not physically resume his mayoral duties, Robertson won the <b>second</b> <b>balloting,</b> 2,529 (59 percent) to 1,758 (41 percent). Brown's support decreased by more than 800 votes since the primary, presumably from concerns about his health.|$|R
50|$|After the primary, Livingston quickly {{endorsed}} his House colleague Roemer, then a Democrat, but {{the runoff}} election was canceled because Edwards conceded {{the race to}} Roemer. It was said that Edwards had wanted to face Livingston in a general election, and had that scenario developed he would have remained around for the <b>second</b> <b>balloting.</b> Instead Edwards {{pulled out of the}} <b>second</b> round of <b>balloting</b> to prevent Roemer from consolidating majority support.|$|R
5|$|All {{the while}} Hancock was posted in New York, {{he did his}} best to keep his {{political}} ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but was never a serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept the field on the <b>second</b> <b>ballot.</b> The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E
5|$|Baird co-chaired Jim Flaherty's second {{campaign}} {{to lead the}} Progressive Conservative party in 2004. Flaherty was again unsuccessful, losing on the <b>second</b> <b>ballot</b> to the more centrist John Tory. Baird and Flaherty left provincial politics in 2005 to campaign for the federal House of Commons. Although Baird was generally on {{the right wing of}} the provincial Progressive Conservative Party, he expressed liberal views on some social issues. He supported same-sex marriage during the 2003 provincial election, and in 2005 helped the McGuinty government achieve quick passage of a provincial bill granting legal recognition to same-sex couples.|$|E
5|$|Ten men {{received}} {{votes on}} the first vice-presidential ballot. Mississippi's John A. Quitman had the most support with 59 votes. Eight state delegations – {{with a total of}} 55 votes – voted for Breckinridge in spite of his refusal of the nomination, making him the second-highest vote getter. Kentucky cast its 12 votes for Boyd, bringing his third-place total to 33 votes. Seeing Breckinridge's strength on the first ballot, large numbers of delegates voted for him on the <b>second</b> <b>ballot,</b> {{and those who did not}} soon saw that his nomination was inevitable and changed their votes to make it unanimous.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, Crane led {{the nonpartisan}} blanket primary with 5,488 votes (39 percent) {{and went into}} a contested general {{election}} with Democrat Margaret Pereboom, who trailed with 4,366 ballots (31 percent). A third candidate, fellow Republican Steve Myers, received 4,135 votes (30 percent). Pereboom had also run in 1987. In the <b>second</b> <b>balloting,</b> Crane defeated Pereboom, 8,946 (57 percent) to 6,789 (43 percent).|$|R
50|$|In 1987, {{in his bid}} for {{a fourth}} term in reconfigured House District 22 (Grant, La Salle, and Rapides parishes), Brady led in the primary against six other Democrats but was forced into a runoff {{election}} against A. Dale Smith, who trailed by about 1,500 votes. Smith prevailed in the <b>second</b> <b>balloting,</b> 8,111 (54.1 percent) to 6,893 (45.9 percent). Brady won only narrowly in his own LaSalle Parish and lost Grant and Rapides parishes.|$|R
50|$|Dardenne was hence {{scheduled}} {{to face a}} runoff election with Heitmeier of New Orleans. In the meantime, Francis {{announced that he would}} not support Dardenne in the <b>second</b> <b>balloting</b> but would run again for the position in 2007. Heitmeier pulled out of the race and left Dardenne unopposed. Heitmeier and Dardenne were term-limited in the state Senate and ineligible to have sought reelection in 2007. Heitmeier was succeeded by his brother, David Heitmeier, a New Orleans optometrist.|$|R
5|$|While out of politics, Getty {{became the}} head of an {{investment}} firm and sat on the boards of a number of corporations, including the Royal Bank of Canada and Celanese Canada. However, when Lougheed stepped down from the Progressive Conservative leadership in 1985, Getty entered the contest to replace him and immediately became the favourite. At an October convention, Getty won a <b>second</b> <b>ballot</b> victory against Minister of Municipal Affairs Julian Koziak and former legislator Ron Ghitter.|$|E
5|$|In the 1993 provincial election, Stelmach {{was elected}} as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Vegreville-Viking (later Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville). A Progressive Conservative, {{he served in}} the {{cabinets}} of Ralph Klein—at various times holding the portfolios of Intergovernmental Relations, Transportation, Infrastructure, and Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development—where he developed a reputation as a low-key politician who avoided the limelight. When Klein resigned the party's leadership in 2006, Stelmach {{was among the first to}} present his candidature to replace him. After a third-place finish on the first ballot of the leadership race, he won an upset <b>second</b> <b>ballot</b> victory over former provincial treasurer Jim Dinning.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was unable}} to secure the {{nomination}} at the national convention, so Breckinridge switched his support to Stephen Douglas, but the combination of Pierce and Douglas supporters did not prevent James Buchanan's nomination. After Douglas's floor manager, William Richardson, suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice president would help Buchanan secure the support of erstwhile Douglas backers in the general election, Louisiana's J. L. Lewis nominated him. Breckinridge declined in deference to Linn Boyd but received 51 votes on the first ballot, behind Mississippi's John A. Quitman with 59, but ahead of third-place Boyd, who garnered 33. On the <b>second</b> <b>ballot,</b> Breckinridge received overwhelming support, and opposition delegates changed their votes to make his nomination unanimous.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, three Republicans but no Democrats {{entered the}} House District 68 race {{to choose a}} {{successor}} to Daniel. Lobbyist Kyle Ardoin, a Republican-turned-Democrat-returned-Republican, led the field with 5,531 votes (41 percent) to Steve Carter's 5,242 (38.9 percent). Jay Lyles received the remaining 2,705 votes (20 percent)s. In the <b>second</b> <b>balloting</b> on November 17, which had a lower turnout {{because of the lack}} of a gubernatorial contest, Carter prevailed by 87 votes, 4,967 (50.4 percent) to Ardoin's 4,880 (49.6 percent).|$|R
50|$|Three Republicans {{entered the}} House District 68 race in 2007 to succeed the Democrat-turned-Republican {{incumbent}} William Daniel, a petroleum engineer. Lobbyist Kyle Ardoin, a Republican-turned-Democrat-returned-Republican, led {{the field with}} 5,531 votes (41 percent) to Carter's 5,242 (38.9 percent). The remaining 2,705 votes (20 percent) were received by Jay Lyles. In the <b>second</b> <b>balloting</b> on November 17, which had a lower turnout {{because of the lack}} of a gubernatorial contest, Carter prevailed by 87 votes, 4,967 (50.4 percent) to Ardoin's 4,880 (49.6 percent).|$|R
50|$|Voting delegates {{were made}} up of Senators, MPs, {{defeated}} candidates, premiers and provincial party leaders, presidents of provincial Liberal associations, and three delegates from each riding. Nominations were accepted in writing until the first ballot began at 3:45 pm. King lead Fielding on the first and <b>second</b> <b>ballots.</b> Graham and McKenzie withdrew in quick succession leading to the cancellation of {{the third and fourth}} ballots, respectively, which had already been underway when the successive withdrawals occurred. On the final ballot King defeated Fielding by 38 votes.|$|R
5|$|Benjamin {{spent the}} summer of 1851 abroad, {{including}} a visit to Paris to see Natalie and Ninette. He was still away in October 1851, when the Whigs nominated him for the state Senate. Despite his absence, he was easily elected. When the new legislature met in January 1852, Benjamin {{emerged as one of}} the leading Whig candidates for election to the U.S. Senate seat that would become vacant on March 4, 1853. As the Louisiana legislature, responsible for electing the state's senators, met once in two years under the 1845 constitution, it was not scheduled to meet again before the seat became vacant. Some Whig newspapers thought Benjamin too young and inexperienced at forty, despite his undoubted talent, but the Whig legislative caucus selected him on the <b>second</b> <b>ballot,</b> and he was elected by the two houses over Democrat Solomon W. Downs.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's {{name had}} been {{proposed}} several times for the Democratic nomination for president, but he never captured a majority of delegates. In 1880, however, Hancock's chances improved. President Hayes had promised not to run for a second term, and the previous Democratic nominee, Tilden, declined to run again due to poor health. Hancock faced several competitors for the nomination, including Thomas A. Hendricks, Allen G. Thurman, Stephen Johnson Field, and Thomas F. Bayard. Hancock's neutrality on the monetary question, and his lingering support in the South (owing to his General Order Number 40) meant that Hancock, {{more than any other}} candidate, had nationwide support. When the Democratic convention assembled in Cincinnati in June 1880, Hancock led on the first ballot, but did not have a majority. By the <b>second</b> <b>ballot,</b> Hancock received the requisite two-thirds, and William Hayden English of Indiana was chosen as his running mate.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, Dormand {{had opposed}} left-wing {{infiltration}} into the Labour Party, and in foreign affairs, he was pro-American and pro-NATO {{at a time}} when the party's left-wing was becoming increasingly hostile to both. In October 1981, Dormand stood for the vacant position of Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, supported by the centre-Right Manifesto Group of Labour MPs. The strength of the left-wing in the Constituency Labour Parties at the time had spurred the Manifesto group to improve its organisation, and Dormand (nominated by former Prime Minister James Callaghan) defeated the main challenger, left-wing MP Ian Mikardo by 102 votes to 65, and Mikardo then withdrew. The other three candidates were Harry Ewing (22 votes), Willie Hamilton (11 votes) and Frank Hooley (11 votes) but all withdrew so no <b>second</b> <b>ballot</b> was held. Dormand held the chairmanship until he retired from the House of Commons in 1987.|$|E
2500|$|Duncan {{became a}} {{candidate}} for the Ontario Liberal Party leadership following the resignation of Lyn McLeod in 1996. [...] His campaign plan combined a cautious fiscal strategy with plans for increased investment in health and education, and his leading supporters included Sean Conway, Tim Murphy and Mike Colle. [...] He finished third on the first and <b>second</b> <b>ballots</b> at the party's 1996 leadership convention, but was eliminated after falling to fourth place behind Dalton McGuinty on the third. [...] Duncan then endorsed Gerard Kennedy, who lost to McGuinty on the fifth ballot.|$|R
5000|$|Lanier {{prevailed in}} the June 10 general election, popularly called the [...] "runoff" [...] in Louisiana, by a convincing margin: 8,420 (68 percent) to 3,934 (32 percent). Snyder {{increased}} his vote from the primary to the general election by only 276 ballots, whereas Lanier more than doubled his final tally. Baker, who was particularly popular among veterans groups and {{was the president of}} the Kisatchie-Delta Regional Planning Commission based in Alexandria, narrowly missed the <b>second</b> <b>balloting</b> by just under 300 votes. Presumably, he too would have won in a showdown with Snyder.|$|R
50|$|Four Republicans and a Democrat {{entered the}} House District 71 race in 2007 to succeed Republican Dale M. Erdey, {{who was elected}} without {{opposition}} to the Louisiana State Senate seat vacated by the conservative Republican Heulette Fontenot. Pope led with 4,837 votes (34.7 percent). In second place was another Republican, John Ware, who polled 2,966 (21.3 percent). In fourth place was the Republican mayor of Livingston, D. Derral Jones. In the <b>second</b> <b>balloting</b> on November 17, which had a much lower turnout {{because of the lack}} of a gubernatorial contest, Pope prevailed, 2,684 (52.2 percent) to Ware's 2,462 (47.8 percent).|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the delegates}} at the {{convention}} continued to cast ballots until a victor could be determined. On the <b>second</b> <b>ballot</b> of the day, a Pennsylvania delegate named W. A. Grier cast a vote for James Garfield. However, the Garfield support remained with that one delegate's vote {{for most of the}} day. The delegates cast eighteen ballots before taking a recess for dinner. After dinner, they came back and cast ten more ballots. Still, no candidate was close to the 379 votes needed to win. After twelve hours of balloting, Massachusetts delegate William Lovering moved to adjourn for the night. A few Grant delegates objected, but the motion to adjourn was passed by a vote of 446 to 308. After twenty-eight ballots, Grant had 307 votes, Blaine had 279 and Sherman had 91, {{and the rest of the}} votes were split between favorite son candidates like William Windom and George F. Edmunds.|$|E
5|$|The Heath {{ministry}} {{continued to}} experience difficulties with oil embargoes and union demands for wage increases in 1973, subsequently losing the February 1974 general election. Labour formed a minority government {{and went on}} to win a narrow majority in the October 1974 general election. Heath's leadership of the Conservative Party looked increasingly in doubt. Thatcher was not initially seen as the obvious replacement, but she eventually became the main challenger, promising a fresh start. Her main support came from the parliamentary 1922 Committee and The Spectator, but Thatcher's time in office gave her the reputation of a pragmatist rather than that of an ideologue. She defeated Heath on the first ballot and he resigned the leadership. In the <b>second</b> <b>ballot</b> she defeated Whitelaw, Heath's preferred successor. The vote polarised along right–left lines, with the region, experience and education of the MP also having their effects. Thatcher's support was stronger among MPs on the right, those from southern England, and those who had not attended public schools or Oxbridge.|$|E
5|$|The balloting {{began the}} {{following}} morning, July 10, with {{a two-thirds vote}} necessary to nominate. Bryan, who remained at his hotel, sent word to the Nebraska delegation to make no deals on his behalf. He stood second out of fourteen candidates in the first ballot, behind Bland. On the <b>second</b> <b>ballot,</b> Bryan still stood second, but had gained as other candidates had fallen away. The third ballot saw Bland still in the lead, but Bryan took the lead on the fourth ballot. According to Jones, {{it was clear that}} Bland could not win, and that Bryan could not be stopped. On the fifth ballot, the Illinois delegation, led by Governor Altgeld, switched its votes from Bland to Bryan. Other delegations, seeing that Bryan would be nominated, also switched, securing the victory. Nevertheless, he won the nomination without the votes of the gold delegates, most of whom either left the convention or refused to vote.|$|E
50|$|The {{first and}} <b>second</b> <b>ballots</b> require a supermajority of 200 {{out of the}} 300-strong body, {{dropping}} to 180 on the third. In {{the event of a}} non-election even after the third ballot, the parliament is to be dissolved and a snap election to be called within ten days. After the new parliament convenes, the second phase begins, with the required majority at 180 votes in the fourth ballot and a simple majority of 151 votes in the fifth ballot. The sixth and last ballot is then contested between the two candidates with the most votes and decided by a relative majority.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the age of}} thirty-three, [...] "Toni" [...] Morrison ran {{for mayor}} in the {{election}} of 1977 but finished in fourth place in the nonpartisan blanket primary, as three white candidates challenged a single African American candidate, Ernest N. [...] "Dutch" [...] Morial. In the <b>second</b> <b>balloting,</b> Morial defeated city councilman Joseph V. DiRosa (later a state district judge) and hence became {{the first in a}} long line of black mayors in New Orleans, a trend which was interrupted in 2010 with the election of Mitch Landrieu. The late state Senator Nat G. Kiefer had finished in third place in the 1977 primary.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the nonpartisan}} blanket primary in October 1983, Morrell forced {{incumbent}} Democrat George C. [...] "Nick" [...] Connor, Jr., into a runoff election for the District 97 House seat. Connor nearly won outright with 5,032 votes (49.3 percent). Morrell, who enjoyed {{strong support from}} then-mayor Ernest N. Morial and in turn supported Morial's ultimately failed bid to change the city charter {{to allow him to}} serve unlimited terms as mayor, trailed with 4,009 (39.3 percent). Democrat Julius Green held the remaining vote, 1,164 (11.4 percent). In the <b>second</b> <b>balloting,</b> Morrell upset Connor by 56 votes, 3,276 (50.4 percent) to 3,220 (49.6 percent).|$|R
5|$|When {{the state}} {{convention}} gathered in April 1880, Randall was confident of victory, but soon {{found that the}} Wallace faction outnumbered his. Wallace's majority scrambled the party's organization in Philadelphia and, although some Randall supporters received seats, the majority owed allegiance to the senator. Despite the defeat, Randall pressed on for Tilden, both in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. As rumors circulated that Tilden's health would keep him from running again, Randall remained a loyal Tilden man up to the national convention that June. After the first ballot, the New York delegation released a letter from Tilden in which he withdrew from consideration. Randall hoped for the ex-Tilden delegates to rally to him. Many did so, and Randall surged to second place on the <b>second</b> <b>ballot,</b> but the momentum had shifted to another candidate, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock. Nearly all of the delegates shifted to Hancock, and he was nominated.|$|E
5|$|Among the Democrats, Samuel J. Tilden was {{the initial}} front-runner, having been the party's nominee in the contested {{election}} of 1876. After Tilden declined a nomination {{due to his}} poor health, his supporters shifted to several other contenders. Cleveland was among the leaders in early support, and Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, Allen G. Thurman of Ohio, Samuel Freeman Miller of Iowa, and Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts also had considerable followings, along with various favorite sons. Each {{of the other candidates}} had hindrances to his nomination: Bayard had spoken in favor of secession in 1861, making him unacceptable to Northerners; Butler, conversely, was reviled throughout the South for his actions during the Civil War; Thurman was generally well liked, but was growing old and infirm, and his views on the silver question were uncertain. Cleveland, too, had detractors—Tammany remained opposed to him—but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends. Cleveland led on the first ballot, with 392 votes out of 820. On the <b>second</b> <b>ballot,</b> Tammany threw its support behind Butler, {{but the rest of the}} delegates shifted to Cleveland, who won. Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana was selected as his running mate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a <b>second</b> <b>ballot</b> was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring {{tax cuts for the}} rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
5000|$|Kennedy, {{a former}} head of Toronto's Daily Bread food bank, was popular on the {{progressive}} wing of the party, while McGuinty built his core support on its establishment and pro-business right-wing which some nicknamed the [...] "anything-but-Kennedy movement". McGuinty was fourth on the first and <b>second</b> <b>ballots,</b> closely behind Dwight Duncan. He then overtook Duncan and Joe Cordiano on {{the third and fourth}} ballots, respectively, receiving the support of their delegates to win a fifth ballot over Kennedy. McGuinty is the only Canadian party leader to win his party's leadership after finishing fourth on the first ballot.|$|R
25|$|By 5 July 2016, Gove was in {{a distant}} third place in the {{leadership}} race {{based on the number}} of endorsements received from other MPs. He was eliminated in the <b>second</b> MPs' <b>ballot.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Krieger polled 211,520 votes (16 percent) in {{the nonpartisan}} blanket primary held on October 21, 1995, for {{lieutenant}} governor, narrowly edging then State Representative Chris John of Crowley for the runoff (called general election in Louisiana) against Blanco. A {{member of the}} Louisiana Public Service Commission at the time, Blanco had led in the initial balloting with 44 percent of the vote. In the <b>second</b> <b>balloting,</b> Blanco defeated Krieger, 964,559 (65.2 percent) to 513,613 (34.8 percent). In that same election, the Republican gubernatorial candidate Murphy J. [...] "Mike" [...] Foster, Jr., defeated the Democrat Cleo Fields by nearly the same margin that Blanco had topped Krieger.|$|R
