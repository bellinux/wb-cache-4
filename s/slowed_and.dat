40|$|In this thesis, new {{techniques}} to generate <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> fast light are proposed and investigated. The {{use of the}} <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> fast light for microwave photonics applications is also investigated. This thesis consists of four parts. In the first part, the generation of <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> fast light based on fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) is studied. Two techniques are proposed. In the first technique, <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> fast light is generated based on a linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating (LCFBG); {{and in the second}} technique, <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> fast light is generated based on a tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG). Theoretical analysis is performed which is verified by experiments. In the second part, the applications of FBG-based <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> fast light in microwave photonics are studied. These applications include all-optical tunable microwave frequency multiplication, tunable microwave chirped pulse generation, tunable phase shifting, tunable fractional order differentiation, and tunable microwave photonic filtering. In the third part, the generation of <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> fast light based on microring resonators (MRRs) is studied. Novel methods to obtain continuously tunable slow to fast light are proposed and experimentally demonstrated by using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MRR with MMI (multi-mode interference) couplers, and a high-contrast Ge-doped silica-on-silicon (SOS) MRR. In the fourth part, the applications of the MRR-based <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> fast light in microwave photonics are studied. These applications include all-optical tunable fractional order differentiation, and tunable fractional order Hilbert transformation...|$|R

5|$|A {{cold front}} stalled {{a couple hundred}} miles {{southeast}} of Bermuda on October 10. During that day, a strong upper-level trough moved southeastward off the southeast coast of the United States. Due to several factors, including upward motion and strong diffluence—the rate at which a fluid moves—the area became baroclinically unstable. This caused {{the interaction between the}} trough and the front to develop into an extratropical low about 345miles (555km) southeast of Bermuda on October 11. The low moved quickly northward, then northwestward, strengthening quickly due to the instability of the atmosphere. Late on October 11, the system <b>slowed,</b> <b>and</b> the upper-level circulation became aligned with the low-level circulation. The extratropical storm began to develop tropical characteristics late on October 11, including surface temperatures warmer than the surrounding environment, and vertical wind characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Based on its organization, the system developed into Subtropical Storm One early on October 12 while located about 35miles (55km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|After fierce fighting, the Comanches fled. Ross {{and several}} of his men pursued the chief and a second, unknown, rider.

Ross continued to follow the chief, eventually shooting him three times. The chief refused to surrender, even after falling from his horse. Ross's cook, Anton Martinez, who had been a captive in Nocona's band, identified the fallen chief as Nocona. With Ross's permission, Martinez fired the shot that took Nocona's life. Nocona was the only Comanche male to die in the fighting; 13 Comanche women were also killed. Ross's men suffered no casualties.|$|E

5|$|Around 10:00pm {{local time}} on 4January, {{the centre of}} Tropical Cyclone Helen made {{landfall}} near Channel Point. As it moved ashore, the storm developed an eye; however, this feature began breaking apart once overland and the eyewall merged into the system's feeder bands. Roughly 12hours after landfall, Helen weakened to a tropical low before moving over the Gulf of Carpentaria late on 5January. Due {{to an increase in}} forward motion, the system was unable to regenerate sufficient convection to be reclassified a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall along the Cape York Peninsula. Once overland again, the remnants of Helen abruptly <b>slowed</b> <b>and</b> were last noted on 7January in the same region.|$|E
5|$|During {{the presidential}} {{referendum}} in Egypt, Nasser was re-elected {{to a second}} term as UAR president and took his oath on 25 March 1965. He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy <b>slowed</b> <b>and</b> government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned bank loans to private business and introducing incentives to increase exports. During the 60's, the Egyptian economy went from sluggishness to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.|$|E
5|$|However, Psittacosaurus may {{not have}} been entirely bipedal for its entire lifespan. Taking {{sections}} from the limb bones of 16 specimens of Psittacosaurus, ranging in age from less than a year old to ten-year old adults, Qi Zhao from the University of Bristol found that Psittacosaurus was probably secondarily bipedal. The infants' front limbs grew at faster rates than the hind limbs at between birth and three years of age. At the age of between four and six years, arm growth <b>slowed</b> <b>and</b> leg growth accelerated as the animal became mature. At this stage, Psittacosaurs would switch to a bipedal stance. These findings further reveal that the ancestor of Psittacosaurus was likely quadrupedal and eventually gained the ability to become bipedal as it evolved, with the young retaining the quadrupedal gait of the ancestor in question. These findings also lead to the hypothesis that many such dinosaur families may have evolved along this path {{at some point in their}} evolution.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Bonnie {{was a major}} {{hurricane}} {{that made}} landfall in North Carolina, United States, inflicting severe crop damage. The second named storm, first hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed from a tropical wave that emerged {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 14. The wave gradually developed, and the system was designated a tropical depression on August 19. The depression began tracking towards the west-northwest, and became a tropical storm the next day. On August 22, Bonnie was upgraded to a hurricane, with a well-defined eye. The storm peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and around the same time, the storm <b>slowed</b> <b>and</b> turned more towards the north-northwest. A large and powerful cyclone, Bonnie moved ashore in North Carolina early on August 27, slowing as it turned northeast. After briefly losing hurricane status, the storm moved offshore and regained Category 1-force winds, although it weakened again on entering cooler waters.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ginger was {{the second}} longest-lasting Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record. The eighth tropical cyclone and fifth hurricane of the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season, Ginger spent 27.25days as a tropical cyclone, lasting from September6 to October3. Twenty of those days (September 11 – September 30), Ginger was classified as a hurricane. The storm formed northeast of the Bahamas, {{and for the first}} nine days of its duration tracked generally eastward or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110mph (175km/h). On September14, Ginger <b>slowed</b> <b>and</b> turned to a general westward track, passing near Bermuda on September23. There, the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves, but no damage.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the storm}} was {{tracking}} towards the northwest, between another low pressure system to its west and a low- to mid-level ridge to its east. Throughout the day, thunderstorm activity remained unstable, possibly {{as a result of}} cooler waters churned up by previous storms. In addition, mid- to upper-level dry air had become entrained into the circulation, and the storm contained some subtropical characteristics with a baroclinic-type cloud pattern. By early September 29, Isaac had <b>slowed</b> <b>and</b> turned towards the west. Convection began to intensify and consolidate later that day; outflow had also improved, and became more symmetric in nature. Moving into warmer waters, Isaac continued to strengthen, and attained hurricane status on September 30. However, this period of intensification was short-lived, and the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 85mph (140km/h) at around 0000 UTC on October 1.
