5|$|Three soil {{associations}} {{exist in}} the Darby Creek watershed. The Neshaminy-Lehigh-Glenlg soil association is prevalent in the northwest part of the watershed. It consists of <b>silty,</b> well drained, gravelly, and deep soil that rests on gabbro and granodiorite bedrock. The Chester-Glenlg-Manor soil association is prevalent throughout the watershed except in its lower reaches. It consists of <b>silty,</b> channery, and shallow to deep soil that rests on brown schist and gneiss bedrock. The Urban Land-Wetbrook-Pitts soil association is prevalent {{in the southern part}} of the watershed. It consists of <b>silty,</b> sandy, and deep soil that rests on coastal sediments. Roughly 53% of the land in the Darby Creek watershed is classified as having slightly erodible soil.|$|E
5|$|Two soil {{associations}} {{exist in}} the Ithan Creek watershed. The Neshaminy-Lehigh-Glenlg soil association is present in {{a small part of}} the watershed. It consists of <b>silty,</b> well drained, gravelly, and deep soil that rests on gabbro and granodiorite bedrock. The Chester-Glenlg-Manor soil association is prevalent through the middle of the watershed. It consists of <b>silty,</b> channery, and shallow to deep soil that rests on brown schist and gneiss bedrock. Most of the watershed is considered to have slightly erodible soil.|$|E
5|$|Further east, the {{homogeneous}} Cardiff divides {{into the}} Bridgewater, Solsville, and Pecksport shale members, from base to top. The Bridgewater is a fissile dark <b>silty</b> shale with relatively rare fossils. A thin concretionary zone lies above, then the Solsville grades from a gray calcareous shale, to sandy siltstones and fine sandstones at the top, with the gray shale of the Pecksport shale and siltsone overlying it.|$|E
5|$|The island's soil is {{composed}} primarily of volcanic material, lagoonal deposits and coralline debris, with <b>silty</b> sand from the dredging. Its volcanic material is Aeolian ash, weathered tuff and basalt. Ford Island proper is a coral outcrop. There are two smaller islets near the island: Mokunui and Mokuiki.|$|E
5|$|S. ciliata is most {{commonly}} called the 'sand whiting' {{in reference to}} its preference for sandy substrates compared to {{some members of the}} genus which prefer muddy, <b>silty,</b> or grassy substrates. Other common names include the 'blue-nose whiting' in reference to the colour of the nose in fish of larger sizes, and 'summer whiting', a name often applied to S. analis as well. This name is applied to these species as they move from deeper offshore waters into shallow beach and estuarine waters in summer, where they become a target for recreational fishers.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{additional}} Dinocephalosaurus specimens {{were discovered}} from the slightly older Luoping locality, {{which has been}} dated to 245–244 million years old based on conodont biostratigraphy as well as preliminary radiometric dating. The specimens originate from bed 74 of the Luoping locality, in deposits located {{near the village of}} Dawazi, Luoping County, Yunnan, China. Bed 74 is part of a section composed of thin dark grey micritic limestone layers mixed with thicker layers of siliceous limestone and <b>silty</b> limestone, which extends downwards to bed 67.|$|E
5|$|Rivers {{and streams}} in the Colorado basin were once home to 49 species of native fish, of which 42 were endemic. Engineering {{projects}} and river regulation {{have led to}} the extinction of four species and severe declines in the populations of 40 species. Bonytail chub, razorback sucker, Colorado pikeminnow, and humpback chub are among those considered the most at risk; all are unique to the Colorado River system and well adapted to the river's natural <b>silty</b> conditions and flow variations. Clear, cold water released by dams has significantly changed characteristics of habitat for these and other Colorado River basin fishes. A further 40 species that occur in the river today, notably the brown trout, were introduced during the 19th and 20thcenturies, mainly for sport fishing.|$|E
5|$|All of the localities that Eolambia were {{discovered}} in belong to the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation. Predominant rocks in the Mussentuchit consist of interleaved light gray to gray layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone. Deposits representing two separate river channel systems are also present in the Mussentuchit. The lower of these systems consists of four layers, respectively of muddy sandstone, fine-grained sandstone, <b>silty</b> mudstone, and fine-grained sandstone, with the latter two layers bearing plant debris. The Cifelli #2 Quarry is associated with this system. The upper system consists of greenish fine-grained sandstone. Three layers of bentonite clay layers, representing volcanic ash deposits, are also present in the Mussentuchit, being respectively whitish-gray, yellow, and tan in color. The middle of these layers cuts through the Cifelli #2 Quarry. Bentonite is also present within the sandstone itself throughout the Mussentuchit. In the Cifelli #2 quarry, the bones themselves are blackened, having been replaced by calcite, quartz, pyrite, and carbonate-hydroxyapatite.|$|E
5|$|Erosion can be {{the result}} of {{material}} movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand dunes, on a beach or in a desert. Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, <b>silty,</b> pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{geological}} {{formation in the}} valley is the Supra-Pennant Measures of the Carboniferous period. It is a significant feature towards the north-eastern part of the area and {{is represented by the}} Pensford Syncline coal basin, which formed part of the Somerset coalfield. It is a complex formation containing coal seams and is made up of clay and shales. The landscape is typically undulating and includes outcrops of sandstone. Most of the area around Stanton Drew have neutral to acid red loamy soils with slowly permeable subsoils. Soils to {{the eastern part of the}} area are slowly permeable clayey and fine <b>silty</b> soils. They are found on Carboniferous clay and shales typical of the Supra-Pennant Measures. They are frequently waterlogged where the topography dictates. They tend towards being acid and are brown to grey brown in colour. In the south and south east of the area there are coal measures which are sufficiently near the surface for coal mining to have taken place around Clutton and High Littleton. In the eastern area of the valley as the River Chew flows through Publow, Woollard and Compton Dando before joining the River Avon at Keynsham there are alluvial deposits of clay soils.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile <b>silty</b> clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E
25|$|The Winterburn Group is {{composed}} of <b>silty</b> dolomite, evaporite, argillaceous limestone, red and green siltstone, anhydrite, <b>silty</b> dolomite and siltstone. Pinnacle reefs develop in the Nisku Formation.|$|E
25|$|The soil is {{alluvial}} and <b>silty</b> in nature, underlaid by clay or mud, with a {{peat layer}} in places.|$|E
25|$|The soils of Austin {{range from}} shallow, gravelly clay loams over {{limestone}} {{in the western}} outskirts to deep, fine sandy loams, <b>silty</b> clay loams, <b>silty</b> clays or clays in the city's eastern part. Some of the clays have pronounced shrink-swell properties and are difficult to work under most moisture conditions. Many of Austin's soils, especially the clay-rich types, are slightly to moderately alkaline and have free calcium carbonate.|$|E
25|$|It is {{more likely}} to occur in sandy or non-plastic <b>silty</b> soils, but may in rare cases occur in gravels and clays (see quick clay).|$|E
25|$|The Lower Tunbridge Wells Sand {{shows the}} best cyclic fining up {{sequences}} in the formation. The division comprises mainly interbedded siltstones and <b>silty</b> sandstones and occurs up to 27m thick.|$|E
25|$|The dust {{concentration}} has {{a peak of}} ~3mg/kg at 200 m above bedrock (depth 1837 m), {{second only to the}} <b>silty</b> ice (>20mg/kg) of the bottom 25 m, which has a very high deformation rate.|$|E
25|$|The Upper Tunbridge Wells Sand {{is similar}} to the Lower Tunbridge Wells Sand. It {{comprises}} soft red and grey mottled silts and clays in its lower part, and alternating silts and <b>silty</b> clays with thin beds of sandstones.|$|E
25|$|Where {{it occurs}} in the wild, it is found {{infrequently}} in deciduous forests and valleys on acidic loess (i.e. fine, <b>silty</b> soil) with good drainage. The soil it inhabits is typically in the pH range of 5.0 to 5.5.|$|E
25|$|The summit area is {{composed}} mostly of till (clayey <b>silty</b> gravel) overlying rocks of the Lincomb Tarn Formation. This consists of dacitic lapilli-tuff with andesite sills. The eastern plateau above Thirlmere shows some outbreaks of the volcaniclastic sandstone of the Esk Pike Formation.|$|E
25|$|The {{habitat of}} the oriental trumpeter whiting is largely unknown, but it's known {{to live in}} inshore coastal waters, {{commonly}} in embayments on <b>silty</b> bottoms in water depths from 0 - 60m depth. Juveniles often enter the surf zone of beaches, mixing with juveniles from other species of Sillago.|$|E
25|$|Wetaskiwin sits on {{what was}} {{formerly}} {{the coast of the}} large sea that covered much of Alberta millions of years ago. The northwest end of Wetaskiwin is characterized by hills with sandy soil (formerly sand dunes), while the southeast end of the city is very flat with more <b>silty</b> soil.|$|E
25|$|Broadleaf {{evergreen}} plants, including palms, dominate Brownsville {{neighborhoods to}} a greater degree than is seen elsewhere in Texas—even in nearby cities such as Harlingen and McAllen. Soils are mostly of clay to <b>silty</b> clay loam texture, moderately alkaline (pH 8.2) to strongly alkaline (pH8.5) and with a significant degree of salinity in many places.|$|E
25|$|The {{base of the}} Tunbridge Wells Sand {{is marked}} by a {{distinct}} change from the predominantly argillaceous sediments of the Wadhurst Clay to siltstones and <b>silty</b> sands. This boundary is often indicated on maps by spring lines and seepages, where groundwater percolating through the permeable Tunbridge Wells Sand is forced to surface at the junction with the Wadhurst Clay.|$|E
25|$|Modern buried pipe drains often {{consist of}} corrugated, flexible, and {{perforated}} plastic (PE or PVC) pipe lines wrapped with an envelope or filter material {{to improve the}} permeability around the pipes and to prevent entry of soil particles, which is especially important in fine sandy and <b>silty</b> soils. The surround may consist of synthetic fibre (geotextile).|$|E
25|$|Equipment used by cave divers {{ranges from}} fairly {{standard}} recreational scuba configurations, to more complex arrangements which allow more {{freedom of movement}} in confined spaces, extended range in terms of depth and time, allowing greater distances to be covered in acceptable safety, and equipment which helps with navigation, in what are usually dark, and often <b>silty</b> and convoluted spaces.|$|E
25|$|Engineering {{projects}} and river regulation {{have led to}} the extinction of four species and severe declines in the populations of 40 species. The bonytail chub, razorback sucker, Colorado pikeminnow, and humpback chub are among those considered the most at risk. All are unique to the Colorado River system and well adapted to the river's natural <b>silty</b> conditions and flow variations.|$|E
25|$|These {{specimens}} were discovered, buried together, {{near the}} Sankeshu Village of Lufeng County, Yunnan, China in 2013, and are stored at the Bureau of Land and Resources of Lufeng County. The rocks that these specimens were preserved in, consisting of purple <b>silty</b> mudstone, {{belong to the}} Early Jurassic Shawan Member of the Lufeng Formation, which has been tentatively dated to being Hettangian in age.|$|E
25|$|The {{west coast}} of Devonian North America, by contrast, was a passive margin with deep <b>silty</b> embayments, river deltas and estuaries, found today in Idaho and Nevada; an {{approaching}} volcanic island arc reached the steep slope of the continental shelf in Late Devonian times and began to uplift deep water deposits, a collision that was the prelude to the mountain-building episode {{at the beginning of}} the Carboniferous called the Antler orogeny.|$|E
25|$|The Kayenta Formation {{is part of}} the Glen Canyon Group that {{includes}} formations not only in northern Arizona but also parts of southeastern Utah, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. It is composed mostly of two facies, one dominated by <b>silty</b> deposition and the other dominated by sandstone. The siltstone facies is found in much of Arizona, while the sandstone facies is present in areas of northern Arizona, southern Utah, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. The formation was primarily deposited by rivers, with the <b>silty</b> facies as the slower, more sluggish part of the river system. Kayenta Formation deposition was ended by the encroaching dune field that would become the Navajo Sandstone. A definitive radiometric dating of this formation has not yet been made, and the available stratigraphic correlation has been based on a combination of radiometric dates from vertebrate fossils, magnetostratigraphy and pollen evidence. It has been surmised that the Kayenta Formation was deposited during the Sinemurian and Pliensbachian stages of the Early Jurassic Period or approximately 196 to 183 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Liquefaction is {{more likely}} to occur in loose to {{moderately}} saturated granular soils with poor drainage, such as <b>silty</b> sands or sands and gravels capped or containing seams of impermeable sediments. During wave loading, usually cyclic undrained loading, e.g. seismic loading, loose sands tend to decrease in volume, which produces an increase in their pore water pressures and consequently a decrease in shear strength, i.e. reduction in effective stress.|$|E
25|$|The wreck lay in 20m {{of water}} on a <b>silty</b> bottom and was found on 13 May 2013. The muntz metal outline that {{originally}} clad {{the outside of the}} hull and a pile of basalt which was the final cargo of blue metal from Kiama are all that was visible. The bow can still be made out (basically pointing to the harbour bridge) and some concreted near here which is most likely anchor chain.|$|E
25|$|Bangalore has {{a handful}} of {{freshwater}} lakes and water tanks, the largest of which are Madivala tank, Hebbal lake, Ulsoor lake, Yediyur Lake and Sankey Tank. Groundwater occurs in <b>silty</b> to sandy layers of the alluvial sediments. The Peninsular Gneissic Complex (PGC) is the most dominant rock unit {{in the area and}} includes granites, gneisses and migmatites, while the soils of Bangalore consist of red laterite and red, fine loamy to clayey soils.|$|E
25|$|Inimicus is a genus of venomous fishes, {{closely related}} to the true stonefishes. This genus {{is a member of the}} family Synanceiidae (devilfishes, goblinfishes, and stonefishes) of the ray-finned fish order Scorpaeniformes. These benthic fishes are found on sandy or <b>silty</b> {{substrates}} of lagoon and seaward reefs, in coastal regions of tropical oceans. The ten described species are collectively known by various common names, including ghoul, goblinfish, sea goblin, spiny devilfish, stinger, and stingfish).|$|E
25|$|The trumpeter whiting, Sillago maculata, (also {{known as}} the winter whiting or diver whiting) is a common species of coastal marine fish of the smelt-whiting family, Sillaginidae. The trumpeter whiting is endemic to Australia, inhabiting the eastern seaboard from {{southern}} New South Wales to northern Queensland. The species is found in bays, estuaries, coastal lakes and mangrove creeks on <b>silty</b> and muddy substrates in waters ranging from 0 to 30 m deep, occasionally inhabiting sandy and seagrass beds.|$|E
25|$|The Stanley Shale is {{predominantly}} a clayey, thinly fissile, black to green shale, with {{large amounts of}} sandstone interbedded throughout the formation. The sandstone, when freshly exposed, is a hard, fine-grained, feldspathic, <b>silty</b> sandstone, but weathers easily to a soft, clayey porous material ranging from green to brown in color. Almost all of the low-lying areas {{in the city of}} Hot Springs are composed of the Stanley Shale, and it surrounds Hot Springs Mountain on the south, east, and west sides.|$|E
