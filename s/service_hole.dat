40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an experimental, numerical and analytical study to develop a design method to calculate punching shear resistance for a new shearhead system between tubular steel column and reinforced concrete flat slab. This shearhead system enables two of the most popular structural systems, i. e. reinforced concrete flat slab floor and steel tubular column, to be used to produce efficient structures of low cost and short construction time. This research investigates slabs without and with a <b>service</b> <b>hole</b> adjacent to the column. The new shearhead system should not only possess sufficient punching shear resistance, but should also be efficient for construction. The main methodology for this project was based on numerical finite element simulations verified by two full scale tests. These two tests were carried out in the University of Manchester's Structural Testing Laboratory. The two specimens had the same slab size, thickness and reinforcement ratio, but differed in the column shape (rectangular or circular), central reinforcement arrangement (continuous or discontinuous), shearhead position in the slab thickness and shearhead fabrication arrangement. Recorded load-deflection and load-strain relationships, crack development and critical perimeter were used for detailed validation of using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS. The validated ABAQUS model was used to conduct a comprehensive parametric study to investigate the effects of a number of design parameters, including the effect of varied column size, shearhead arm length, shearhead arm cross section, shearhead arm angle, amount of flexural reinforcement, slab thickness, shearhead positions and hole positions. The main conclusion from the parametric study was that the shearhead system could be treated as an enlarged column in normal flat slab structure. The parametric study enabled pressure distribution below the shearhead arms to be approximated for checking whether the shearhead arms would be sufficient for the enlarged column assumption to be valid. The parametric study results were also used to determine the effective depth of the flat slab and critical punching shear perimeter of the slab with and without a <b>service</b> <b>hole.</b> Using the enlarged column assumption, the punching shear resistance of all structures used in the parametric study were re-calculated using Eurocode 2 (EC 2), British stand 8110 (BS 8110) and American Concrete Institute code 318 (ACI 318). Comparison of calculation results using these three design methods indicates that both EC 2 and BS 8110 predicted very close value which reached very good agreement with the ABAQUS simulation (normally within 10 %). Among these three design methods, ACI 318 was the only code that explicitly considered shearhead system. ACI 318 was not able to predict the slab critical perimeter length with good accuracy, however, its prediction of slab punching shear resistance achieved reasonably good agreement with numerical analysis results and were on the safe side. Based on these studies, a design method for calculating punching resistance of the proposed shearhead system between reinforced concrete flat slab and steel tubular column has been developed in this thesis.

50|$|Buildings {{designed}} with sustainable architecture principles use airtight technologies to conserve energy. Under low energy building, passive house, low-energy house, self-sufficient homes, zero energy building, and superinsulation standards, structures {{must be more}} air-tight than previously. Air barriers, careful sealing of construction joints and <b>service</b> penetrations (<b>holes</b> for pipes, etc.) achieve this. Airtightness minimizes the amount of warm (or cool) air that can pass through the structure, so the mechanical ventilation system can recover the heat before discharging air externally. Green buildings may include windows that combine triple-pane insulated glazing with argon or krypton gas to reduce thermal conductivity and increase efficiency. In landscape and exterior construction projects, airtight seals protect general service and landscape lighting electrical connections and splices. Many other specific applications must meet airtight standards to be waterproof or vapor-proof for human safety and proper function.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 A machine {{capable of}} demonstrating and solving {{queueing}} problems {{is useful to}} any systems engineer. This paper describes a successful queueing simulator constructed from readily available materials. The machine is easy to operate, portable, and simple enough {{to be built in}} any well equipped machine shop. The educational values of a queueing simulator are unlimited. For this reason the paper was oriented towards classroom applications. Example problems present ample opportunity to compare theoretical and simulator solutions. Although constant, normal, and Poisson distributions are illustrated, any arrival or service pattern is acceptable. More realistic answers are obtained for many problems because arrival and service rates can be correlated to queue length. Single-server, multi-server, and multi-stage queues can be analyzed. This versatility aids conceptual realization required for system modifications. From the data available, simulator and theoretical solutions compare reasonably well. When making an industrial waiting line study a number of proposals must be investigated. By comparing them on the simulator the most economical one can usually be chosen. Thus, in addition to being an educational aid, the simulator is a practical problem solving device. Principles of operation are visually displayed by schematics of the electrical and mechanical systems. Queue length is determined by the number of one-quarter inch steel balls waiting for <b>service</b> from <b>holes</b> punched in a tape, The number and spacing of the tape holes represents the desired mathematical distribution. Tape speeds are controlled by varying the voltages applied to 12 volt motors. Total material cost amounted to 200, External power is supplied by 110 volt AC current.

40|$|Cold-formed steel {{sections}} {{are often}} used as wall studs or floor joists and such sections often include web holes for ease of installation of <b>services.</b> The <b>holes</b> are normally punched or bored and are unstiffened; when the holes are near to points of concentrated load, web crippling can be the critical design consideration. Recently, {{a new generation of}} cold-formed steel channel sections with edge-stiffened circular holes has been developed, for which web crippling may not be so critical. In this paper, a combination of experimental investigation and non-linear elasto-plastic finite element analyses are used to investigate the effect of such edge-stiffened holes under the interior-one-flange (IOF) and end-one-flange (EOF) loading conditions; for comparison, sections without holes and with unstiffened holes are also considered. A total of 90 results comprising 36 tests and 54 finite element analysis results are presented. Owing to manufacturing constraints, in the test programme, the edge-stiffener length was fixed at 13 mm. Good agreement between the experimental and finite element results was obtained. For the case of the unstiffened hole, it is shown that the web crippling strength is reduced by up to 12 % and 28 % for the IOF and EOF loading conditions, respectively. However, with the edge-stiffened circular hole, the web crippling strength is only reduced by 3 % for the IOF loading condition and there is no reduction in strength for the EOF loading condition. The finite element model was used for the purposes of a parametric study on the effects of different hole sizes, edge-stiffener length and distances of the web holes to the near edge of the bearing plate. The results indicate that with a suitable edge-stiffener length, the web crippling strength of cold-formed steel channel section with holes can be as high as the one without holes...|$|R

50|$|By 1976 {{with his}} new DDL {{technology}} and his lead in innovative open hole solutions, Marvin Gearhart was {{looking for ways to}} expand his company and gain a step on industry giant Schlumberger. Open hole was where the money was. It was where drillers decided to go ahead with further production. Gearhart looked to the north and Canada for an answer. The Canadian open hole market was then controlled by just a couple of companies. Gearhart met with several Canadian firms to set up a possible partnership. It was a struggle but Gearhart struck a deal in 1976 with a merger of one of Gearhart's former clients called Perfco and Wireline Electronics. This new partnership would be called Computalog Services and be headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. Perfco and GO were now in the digital wireline open hole business with a domination of the Canadian market ahead of them. For the next several years Computalog, under CEO Walter Dawson, operated basically as an independent company with promising success. It was combined with the cased <b>hole</b> <b>services</b> and the name was changed to Computalog Wireline. The Canadian employees were sent to Fort Worth for training on the new system.|$|R
40|$|Applications {{of small}} {{computers}} in snow safety and avalanche forecasting {{can be divided}} into categories like (a) compiling weather and snowpack history, (b) on-line data acquisition and (c) real-time analysis. As an example of real-time analysis, this paper describes a program that combines overnight snowfall and wind speed data with a file of slidepath topography to point out starting zones most likely wind-loaded. BEGINNINGS Most personnel responsible for present-day snow safety or avalanche control programs have witnessed the entire development of small, or personal computers, from crude scientific toys to the boxes of desktop magic that perform so much of what we call work, today. Throughout this transformation, a few snow-safety specialists have struggled to enlist these machines as avalanche forecasting aids. This paper briefly traces some of their efforts, and provides a new example, with the objective of showing how we've begun, and how we might arrive at computer-aided snow safety. Back in 1975, before "microprocessor " was a household word, before these tiny silicone chips invaded almost every item of electronics in our homes, Gary Poulson built a Heathkit * model H 8 computer and began to use it in his job as Snow Ranger (USDA Forest <b>Service)</b> at Jackson <b>Hole</b> ski area in Wyoming, U. S. A. With programming help from Jim Olsen (now with the U. S. Park Service), Poulson began compiling the weather and avalanche control data for Jackson Hole into disk files on the H 8. Each morning that avalanche control work was required on the ski area, the computer searched these files to identify previous days with closely matching weather conditions (temperature, wind speed and direction, old snow surface, new snow available for transport). Results of control work on these similar days were presented by the computer from corresponding disk files. To this, Poulson added his interpretation for briefing the avalanche control teams during their early-morning tram ride. At this writing, data for 944 days form the dat...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Overfishing of our {{national}} marine resources has degraded {{some of the most}} productive fishing regions in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, most notably the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank. These regions may have shifted from productive trophic regimes to a less than optimal state therefore reducing fishers’ catches and associated revenue from commercially targeted species (Sinclair and Murawski, 1997, Jennings et al, 2001). Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been offered as an effective management tool to preserve biodiversity, enhance commercial fisheries, and protect against poor decisions in fisheries management (Bohnsack, 1999). Geographic information systems (GIS) bring together the fields of geography and fisheries management to help build {{a better understanding of the}} spatial interactions of complex marine environments (e. g., Kracker, 1999). Using GIS and spatial management such as MPAs can help fishery managers conserve and improve the population status of important biological resources while helping to preserve commercial fishing, an important social and political industry in New England. Incorporating the needs of stakeholders in management decisions is necessary in order to implement an effective fisheries management strategy (e. g., Malakoff, 2002). This study used a weighted optimization raster model in a GIS to compare biological significant regions, which were composed of biodiversity estimates and spawning and juvenile habitats, to important commercial fishing grounds in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank. Biodiversity, spawning and juvenile data values were derived from fishery independent data collected by 2 the National Marine Fisheries <b>Service</b> in Woods <b>Hole,</b> MA. The essential commercial fishing zones were created from Vessel Trip Reports, which are derived directly from reports sent in by federally permitted fishers. The weighted model compares the biologically important resources from an area, or cell, to the level of commercial fishing occurring in the same cell using simple mathematically algorithms in map algebra. The model output shows where placement of MPAs might be most beneficial in order to conserve marine resources and enhance fisheries, as well as areas where fishing is more suitable. Output can be viewed in multiple ways, a spectrum of values ranging from negative numbers to positive ones or simply as areas important for the fishing community or potential MPA. The more negative the value in the spectrum output then the more important the area would be for fishers and conversely the more positive the output then the more suitable the area would be for possible MPA designation. The optimization model can be tuned to meet management goals and objectives by adjusting the weighting scenarios for the input variables. The model design can be used for multiple species and ecosystem management or to protect specifically targeted species of particular concern. Managers may use the output to delineate MPAs in a variety of ways depending on the conditions of the resources and the prospects of the fishing community. Managers will enjoy greater success as the needs of both fishers and biological resources are met...|$|R
