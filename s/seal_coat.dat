40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the evaluation of three issues related to routine maintenance of highway pavements. These are: (1) whether and how much routine maintenance {{has an impact on}} the pavement 2 ̆ 7 s serviceability and/or expected service life; (2) whether <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> practice is cost-effective, and what is the optimal timing for this activity; and (3) what directions, principles and criteria should be used for chip and sand <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> activities on Indiana state highway system. ^ The first issue was evaluated using before/after statistical comparisons; the means of indicators for groups of roadway sections receiving maintenance and groups not receiving maintenance were compared to determine if the differences in the means were statistically significant. The results were subjected to engineering judgement in order to verify if the conclusions are justifiable or not. General linear regression models were then used to quantify the impacts. The second issue was evaluated by using a life cycle costing approach. The costs included in the evaluation covered annual routine maintenance costs, <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> costs, and resurfacing costs at the end of lifecycle. The third issue was dealt with utilizing a number of techniques: an expert opinion survey, a comparative evaluation of practices in other jurisdictions, and telephone interviews and focused group discussions. ^ Testing of significance yielded three groups of findings: the first group contained activities that demonstrated a 2 ̆ 2 definitely significant 2 ̆ 2 impact on either roughness measurements, pavement serviceability ratings, or both; the second group, activities that demonstrated a 2 ̆ 2 marginally significant 2 ̆ 2 impact on the condition indicators listed above; and the third, activities that could not be confirmed either way. ^ Life cycle costing illustrated that <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> is more of a stop-gap measure allowing greater flexibility in capital spending than a cost-effective solution to problems. ^ The developed policy guidelines included a general statement on when and where <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> should be applied; a set of principles that defined which types of roads should receive priority; and a decision tree to assist in making decisions on specific projects. ^ The study recommended a three finger strategy for the improved definition of the effectiveness of maintenance activities. A component of this strategy is the undertaking of a series of controlled experiments whose design was provided. ...|$|R

40|$|This study covers {{pavement}} surface maintenance {{on three}} surface types: rigid, flexible and composite (asphalt overlay on rigid pavement). It addresses 3 main issues as follows: 1) Do routine maintenance activities {{make a difference}} in terms of pavement serviceability? If yes, how much? 2) Are chip and sand <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> cost-effective? What is their optimal timing? 3) What management criteria should be used as a guide to make <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> decisions on specific roadways? In resolving Issue # 1, a stratified 2 -stage sample of observational data was used in a statistical before/after comparison. SAS-General Linear Model was used due to its flexibility in treating continuous and class variables. Most activities showed significant effect (either alone or in combination with others) on Pavement Serviceability Ratings or Roughness Numbers. In resolving Issue Hi, Life Cycle Cost Analysis was applied using agency and user costs. Results showed that optimal timing for <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> is in the PSI range of 3. 0 to 2. 7, dependent on AADT. In resolving Issue # 3, a literature search, telephone interviews and expert opinion survey were used to augment the findings on Issue # 2 in generating a decision tree. The developed tree uses the available data at INDOT, although surface distress related criteria would be superior. The tree helps analyze the likely cause of distress, the preferred solution and a priority ranking in the case of funding shortages.

50|$|Another type of {{profilograph}} {{system is}} {{for measuring the}} surface texture of a road and how {{it relates to the}} coefficient of friction and thus to skid resistance. Pavement texture is divided into three categories; megatexture, macrotexture, and microtexture. Microtexture cannot currently be measured directly, except in a laboratory. Megatexture is measured using a similar profiling method as when obtaining IRI values, while macrotexture is the measurement of the individual variations of the road within a small interval of a few centimeters. For example, a road which has gravel spread on top followed by an asphalt <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> will have a high macrotexture, and a road built with concrete slabs will have low macrotexture. For this reason, concrete is often grooved or roughed up immediately after it is laid on the road bed to increase the friction between the tire and road.|$|E

40|$|This project {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> materials and design method. The primary objectives of this research are 1) to evaluate <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance from various combinations of aggregates and emulsions in terms of aggregate loss; 2) to evaluate how the properties of aggregates and emulsions affect <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance; 3) to evaluate current <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design methods based on INDOT <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> practice; and 4) to develop <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design software incorporating Indiana practice. To evaluate the effects of aggregate and emulsion types on aggregate loss performance of <b>seal</b> <b>coat,</b> three emulsions and eight aggregates including CRS- 2 P, RS- 2 P, and AE- 90 S for emulsions and Trap Rock, Sandstone, Blast Furnace Slag, Steel Slag, Limestone, Dolomite, Crushed Gravel (one face), and Crushed Gravel (two faces) were tested utilizing the sweep test and Vialit test. In addition, to explore influential factors (i. e., electrical surface charge interaction, water evaporation change in emulsion, water affinity of aggregate, etc.), the Zeta potential, water content, and X-ray deflection (XRD) tests were also conducted. According to the Zeta potential test results, the electrical surface charge of an aggregate in emulsions varies {{with the type of}} emulsion (i. e., with the pH of the emulsifier). From the water content test, among the emulsions, CRS- 2 P was the earliest emulsion to have enough bond strength to retain aggregates in open traffic. In addition, aggregate can retard the water evaporation process of emulsions. Based on the XRD test results, Sandstone and Dolomite have the highest and smallest content of SiO 2, respectively among the eight aggregates. This means that Sandstone and Limestone have the highest and lowest water affinity (hydrophilic and hydrophobic), respectively. In the sweep test with Limestone with various curing time, CRS- 2 P showed superior aggregate loss performance among the emulsions. Comparing the sweep test results to the water contents of emulsions, faster water evaporation presented better aggregate loss performance. This finding indicates that the bond strength of emulsion to retain aggregate can be mainly a function of water evaporation in emulsion. Based on the sweep test at 77 ˚F after 24 hours of curing, CRS- 2 P performed the best regardless of aggregate type. The Vialit test at a temperature range of 35 °F to - 22 F° after 24 hours of curing shows the most aggregate loss at lower testing temperatures. AE- 90 S had the strongest resistance in losing aggregate among the three emulsions at lower temperatures, which is an opposite trend comparing to the sweep test results. Also, Crushed Gravel with two faces outperformed Crushed Gravbel with one face. According to statistical analysis results, it was concluded that AE- 90 S and Crushed Gravel with two faces showed the best performance among the emulsions and aggregates, respectively. In addition the best-performing aggregate-emulsion combinations were AE- 90 S with most of the aggregates, except for Steel Slag. Thus, the aggregate type in terms of mineral/chemical composition is not a major factor affecting the aggregate loss performance. To develop a <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design, <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance was evaluated for various emulsion (EAR) and aggregate application rates (AAR) by using three different evaluation methods: the IRI, friction, and visual inspection. Based on these performance tests, immediate failure occurring locally during construction due to incorrect application rate (e. g., insufficient aggregate rate) can cause total failure of the <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> road resulting from a chain reaction. Employing a factor to compensate for AAR discrepancies between target and actual is critical for <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> survival during construction. This study confirms the irrelevance of <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> application to IRI values due to the thin coat and the limitation of the IRI measurement (e. g., 250 mm moving average). The friction test results show an adequate skid resistance performance on all <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> test sections. In addition, friction improvements due to <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> applications were confirmed within a range of <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> rates applied in this study. Overall, IRI, friction, and visual inspection did not show distinct differences in <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance in terms of application rates. A methodology in selecting an equipment factor for correcting any difference between a target rate and a measured rate was developed considering reliability and a designed rate using the McLeod equation. Design software, “INDOT <b>SEAL</b> <b>COAT</b> DESIGN (iSeal) ”, was developed as part of the study to aid the <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design process and incorporates INDOT <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> practice. The software was largely based on the McLeod design method which includes factors that the INDOT <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> specification lacks. Furthermore, an additional factor, an equipment factor, was implemented into the design process to resolve issues due to discrepancies between designed rate and applied rate...|$|E

Seal coats {{are one of the most}} important elements of pavement maintenance because they slow down pavement deterioration. It is less expensive to <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> roads with low traffic volumes every few years than it is to overlay or completely replace the road.
