40|$|AbstractSecondary pest {{outbreak}} is a counterintuitive ecological backlash {{of pesticide}} use in agriculture {{that takes place}} {{with the increase in}} abundance of a non-targeted pest species after pesticide application against a targeted pest species. Although the phenomenon was well recognized, its alternative causes are seldom considered. Outbreaks of the <b>southern</b> <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> Oligonychus ilicis are frequently reported in Brazilian coffee farms after the application of pyrethroid insecticides against the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella. Selectivity favoring the red mite against its main predatory mites is generally assumed as the outbreak cause, but this theory has never been tested. Here, we assessed the toxicity (and thus the selectivity) of deltamethrin against both mite species: the <b>southern</b> <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> and its phytoseid predator Amblyseius herbicolus. Additionally, behavioral avoidance and deltamethrin-induced hormesis were also tested as potential causes of red mite outbreak using free-choice behavioral walking bioassays with the predatory mite and life-table experiments with both mite species, respectively. Lethal toxicity bioassays indicated that the predatory mite was slightly more susceptible than its prey (1. 5 ×), but in more robust demographic bioassays, the predator was three times more tolerant to deltamethrin than its prey, indicating that predator susceptibility to deltamethrin is not a cause of the reported outbreaks. The predator did not exhibit behavioral avoidance to deltamethrin; however insecticide-induced hormesis in the red mite led to its high population increase under low doses, which was not observed for the predatory mite. Therefore, deltamethrin-induced hormesis is a likely cause of the reported red mite outbreaks...|$|E

40|$|The poultry <b>red</b> <b>mite,</b> Dermanyssus gallinae, is {{currently}} a significant pest in the poultry industry in Europe. Biological control {{by the introduction of}} predatory mites is one of the various options for controlling poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites.</b> Here, we present the first results of an attempt to identify potential predators by surveying the mite fauna of European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) nests, by assessing their ability to feed on poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> and by testing for their inability to extract blood from bird hosts, i. e., newly hatched, young starlings and chickens. Two genuine predators of poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> are identified: Hypoaspis aculeifer and Androlaelaps casalis. A review of the literature shows that some authors suspected the latter species to parasitize on the blood of birds and mammals, but they did not provide experimental evidence for these feeding habits and/or overlooked published evidence showing the reverse. We advocate careful analysis of the trophic structure of arthropods inhabiting bird nests as a basis for identifying candidate predators for control of poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an urban {{outbreak}} dermatitis is reported.

40|$|To {{assess their}} {{potential}} to control poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> (Dermanyssus gallinae), we tested selected predaceous mites (Androlaelaps casalis and Stratiolaelaps scimitus) that occur naturally in wild bird nests or sometimes spontaneously invade poultry houses. This was done under laboratory conditions in cages, each with 2 – 3 laying hens, initially 300 poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> {{and later the}} release of 1, 000 predators. These small-scale tests were designed to prevent mite escape from the cages and they were carried out in three replicates at each of three temperature regimes: 26, 30 (constant day and night) and 33 – 25 °C (day-night cycle). After 6 weeks total population sizes of poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> and predatory mites were assessed. For the temperature regimes of 26 and 33 / 25 °C S. scimitus reduced the poultry <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> population relative to the control experiments by a factor 3 and 30, respectively, and A. casalis {{by a factor of}} 18 and 55, respectively. At 30 °C the predators had less effect on <b>red</b> <b>mites,</b> with a reduction of 1. 3 -fold for S. scimitus and 5. 6 -fold for A. casalis. This possibly reflected hen manure condition or an effect of other invertebrates in the hen feed. Poultry <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> control was not negatively affected by temperatures as high as 33 °C and was always better in trials with A. casalis than in those with S. scimitus. In none of the experiments predators managed to eradicate the population of poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites.</b> This may be due to a prey refuge effect since most predatory mites were found in and around the manure tray {{at the bottom of the}} cage, whereas most poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> were found higher up in the cage (i. e. on the walls, the cover, the perch, the nest box and the food box). The efficacy of applying predatory mites in the poultry industry may be promoted by reducing this refuge effect, boosting predatory mite populations using alternative prey and prolonged predator release devices. Biocontrol success, however, will strongly depend on how the poultry is housed in practice (free range, cage or aviary systems) and on which chemicals are applied to disinfect poultry houses and to control other pest...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: By {{considering}} {{an increase}} in drug resistance against <b>red</b> <b>mites,</b> finding the nonchemical herbal acaricide against Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer) (Acari: Mesostigmata) is necessary to kill them and to reduce the chemical resistance against chemical acaricides in this specie. Dermanyssus gallinae is a potential vector of the causal agent of several viral diseases such as Equine encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis. It can be a vector of bacteria such as Salmonella spp., Mycobacterium spp. and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. It is also known to cause itching dermatosis in humans. In this study acaricidal and repellent activities of essential oil of Eucalyptus globulus against Dermanyssus gallinae were studied. Methods: After extracting the essential oil, different concentrations of the plant extract were prepared. Then, acaricidal effect of different concentrations was tested on poultry <b>red</b> <b>mite,</b> Dermanyssus gallinae, by dropping 3 - 4 drops of essential oil on mites. Repellent activity of essential oil was tested by Y-tube olfactometer bioassay. After the test, total number of killed and repellent mites reported. Results: Concentration of 1 : 2 or 50 % had more acaricidal effect on mites. Also essential oil of Eucalyptus globulus had repellent activity against <b>red</b> <b>mites.</b> Conclusion: This study showed that essential oil of Eucalyptus globulus had acaricidal and repellent activities against <b>red</b> <b>mites.</b> Hence it might {{be used as a}} herbal acaricide against it to kill and to reduce the chemical resistance in this specie...|$|R
