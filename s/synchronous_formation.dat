50|$|The Oak Ridges Moraine {{is a pair}} {{of large}} ridges {{composed}} of four elevated wedges. It is bounded to the west by the Niagara Escarpment, a cuesta which was critical to the formation of the moraine, and to the east by the Trent River and Rice Lake. The four wedges (Albion, Uxbridge, Pontypool and Rice Lake from west to east) formed in stages, though some <b>synchronous</b> <b>formation</b> also occurred at an early period of formation. The moraine peaks at the Uxbridge wedge, generally rising from east to west, a result of the moraine's west-to-east formation. That is, the western portion of the moraine received earlier and more frequent sedimentary deposition than the eastern portion, as the ice lobes which controlled the moraine's eastern formation slowly retreated. The Rice Lake wedge is separated from the other wedges where the Oak Ridges Moraine intersects Rice Lake.|$|E

Larvae were reared {{in a closed}} sea water system and first fed Artemia nau- plii eight days after hatching. Three weaning periods were compared by introducing a micropar- ticulate diet on day 15, 20, or 25. The control continued to be fed only Artemia. The lowest growth and survival rates were obtained in the 15 -day group while the highest were in the 25 - day group. After weaning, protease activities (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, pepsin) dropped in all groups, indicating malnutrition. Amylase activity slightly increased in all experimental groups due to the higher starch content in the microparticulate diet than in Artemia and the absolute and relative lipid contents were lower in groups fed the microparticulate diet. Lipase activity suddenly dropped after weaning but slightly rose from day 35 {{until the end of}} the exper- iment (day 40).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of osteopontin (OPN), an ubiquitous acid glycoprotein, on invitro sperm capacitation and on invitro embryo production (IVEP) efficiency in buffalo. In experiment 1, after swim-up separation the sperm were incubated in Tyrode albumin lactate pyruvate medium in the absence of capacitating agents (control), with the standard concentration of heparin (0. 01 mM) and three different concentrations of OPN (0. 1, 1, and 10 mcg/mL), both in the presence and absence of heparin, for 2 and 4 hours. Capacitation was assessed indirectly by estimating the percentage of acrosome-reacted sperm after incubation with lysophosphatidylcholine. In order to determine the effect of OPN, in the presence of heparin, on fertilization (Experiment 2) and invitro embryo development (experiment 3), invitro-matured buffalo oocytes were fertilized in the presence of 0, 0. 1, 1, and 10 mcg/mL of OPN. After IVF, the presumptive zygotes were dezonated, fixed, stained, and then evaluated microscopically. At Days 5 and 7 of culture, the cleavage and blastocyst rates were evaluated, respectively. Two hours of treatment with OPN at the two higher concentrations (1 and 10 mcg/mL) promoted invitro capacitation of buffalo sperm (experiment 1). A synergic action of OPN with heparin was also done for all OPN concentrations tested. At 4 hours incubation, all treatments, including heparin (20. 4 %), improved (P < 0. 01) capacitation compared with the control (16. 2 %). Interestingly, the best results were reported in all groups treated with OPN + heparin (40. 8 %, 38. 6 %, and 33. 8 %, respectively; P < 0. 01). The addition of OPN to the IVF medium had a positive influence on total penetration, <b>synchronous</b> pronuclei <b>formation</b> (experiment 2), and IVEP efficiency (experiment 3). In particular, the two lower concentrations of OPN (0. 1 and 1 mcg/mL), compared with the control, gave higher <b>synchronous</b> pronuclei <b>formation</b> (73. 5 %, 75. 0 %, and 46. 5 %, respectively; P < 0. 01) and cleavage rates (70. 3 %, 71. 6 %, and 59. 3 %, respectively; P < 0. 01). Interestingly, the treatments also improved blastocyst yields (29. 3 %, 30. 3 %, and 19. 4 %, respectively; P < 0. 01).

Interestingly, the repression can be exploited to obtain negative control root samples where LR initiation is absent. This system could be instrumental in the analysis of the molecular basis of drought-responsive as well as intrinsic pathways of LR formation in cereals...|$|R

This interpretation of the geologic history of the region indicates the necessity of an extremely high geothermal gradient and provides a means to evaluate the different crustal plateau hypotheses.

Here we show the direct involvement of ethylene in the formation of necrotic lesions and in basic patho-genesis-related (PR) protein gene induction in tobacco. Increase in ethylene production as well as accumulation of l-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid oxidase (ACO) gene transcript obviously preceded the lesion appearance in tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) -infected leaves in an N gene-dependent <b>synchronous</b> lesion <b>formation</b> system. In-hibitors of ethylene biosynthesis or action significantly suppressed both lesion formation and basic PR gene expression. Induction of these genes was enhanced in 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) -treated leaves especially in ACO-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants. Further, we found that ethylene production during hyper-sensitive reaction is restricted at the level of ACO activity.

This involved development of oceanic crust possibly at a spreading ridge (now preserved as the c. 560 Ma Marlborough ophiolite, New England Orogen), development of forearc crust in a suprasubduction zone between c. 530 and 515 Ma (Tyeiman-Delamerian ophiolites), possible <b>synchronous</b> <b>formation</b> of suprasubduction zone crest further outboard (southern New England Orogen ophiolites), emplacement of Tyennan-Delamerian ophiolites onto the Gondwana margin at c. 515 Ma, followed by development of new forearc and backarc crust between c. 505 and 495 Ma (Lachlan Orogen).

Sleeping Beauty insertional mutagenesis in this model led to accelerated and fully penetrant melanomagenesis and <b>synchronous</b> tumor <b>formation.</b> Treatment of BrafV 618 E transposon mice with the BRAF inhibitor PLX 4720 resulted in tumor regression followed by relapse. Analysis of transposon insertions identified eight genes including Braf, Mitf, and ERas (ES-cell expressed Ras) as candidate resistance genes. Expression of ERAS in human melanoma cell lines conferred resistance to PLX 4720 and induced hyperphosphorylation of AKT (v-akt murine thymoma {{viral oncogene}} homolog 1), a phenotype reverted by combinatorial treatment with PLX 4720 and the AKT inhibitor MK 2206. We show that ERAS expression elicits a prosurvival signal associated with phosphorylation/inactivation of BAD, and that the resistance of hepatocyte growth factor-treated human melanoma cells to PLX 4720 can be reverted by treatment with the BAD-like BH 3 mimetic ABT- 737.

Either Spontang obduction is younger than previously proposed, or the ophiolite remained submerged and/or uneroded until into the Eocene. The Mesozoic grains correlate well with the timing of ∼ 130 Ma volcanism in central Tibet, suggesting that this phase of activity is linked to extension across the whole margin of northern India linked to the separation of India from Australia and Antarctica at that time.

The rate of flavin reduction and <b>synchronous</b> intermediate <b>formation</b> by 4 -(methoxymethyl) phenol is 3. 3 s- 1 and is fast enough to account for turnover (3. 1 s- 1). The anaerobic decay of the intermediate was too slow (0. 01 s- 1) to be of catalytical relevance. The reduced binary complex is rapidly reoxidized (1. 5 × 10 ^ 5 M- 1 s- 1) and is accompanied with formation and release of product. Oxidation of free-reduced enzyme is an even faster process (3. 1 × 10 ^ 5 M- 1 s- 1). The kinetic data for the oxidative demethylation of 4 -(methoxymethyl) phenol are in accordance with a ternary complex mechanism in which the reduction rate is rate-limiting. It is proposed that, upon reduction, a binary complex is produced composed of the p-quinone methide of 4 -(methoxymethyl) phenol and reduced enzyme. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} the incidence of duodeno-gastroesophageal reflux-induced malignant transformation in a series of duodeno-esophageal anastomosis operations in rats. This surgical method provides a model for reflux-induced esophageal pathologies, without carcinogen administration. The study design included the follow-up of 31 cases. Thirty weeks of duodeno-gastroesophageal reflux disease significantly increased the risk of the development of Barrett's esophagus, and reflux-induced esophageal adenocarcinoma formation was evident in four animals. In one of these particular cases, a superficial squamous cell cancer was noted in close vicinity to the adenocarcinoma formation. For further analysis, a detailed immunohistochemical staining protocol was used. The immunophenotypes revealed cyclin D 1 expression (nuclear positivity in 35 % of all the squamous cells), p 53 protein accumulation (50 % nuclear positivity), with a low expression of cox- 2, and negative c-erbB 2 staining in the squamous carcinoma cells. The specialized intestinal metaplasia and mucinous adenocarcinoma cells exhibited exclusively diffuse cox- 2 positivity (90 % of all glandular cells) and weak focal c-erbB 2 (5 %) staining, without cyclin D 1 expression or p 53 protein accumulation. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was applied to quantify the abundance of p 53, cyclin D 1 and cox- 2 mRNAs in this biopsy. The most dramatic changes were observed in the level of expression of cyclin D 1 (a 9. 08 -fold expression as compared with the non-treated esophagus samples), while the p 53 and cox- 2 gene expressions were increased by 1. 61 and 2. 45 -fold, respectively, relative to the non-treated samples. The results afford evidence of the simultaneous activation of more than one possible carcinogenetic pathway in experimental gastroesophageal reflux disease. <b>Synchronous</b> neoplasm <b>formation</b> with different growth pattern characteristics is a rarity in humans, and this phenomenon suggests that the presented model is a suitable means of mimicking the whole spectrum of human gastroesophageal reflux disease pathology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{dynamics}} of cyanobacterial silicification was investigated using synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy. The changes in exo-polymeric polysaccharide and silica vibrational characteristics of individual Calothrix sp. filaments was determined {{over time in}} a series of microcosms in which the microbially sorbed silica or silica and iron load was increased sequentially. The changes in intensity and integrated area of specific infrared spectral features were used to develop an empirical quantitative dynamic model and to derive silica load-dependent parameters for each quasi-equilibrium stage in the biomineralization process. The degree of change in spectral features was derived from the increase in integrated area of the combined silica/polysaccharide region (Si-O/C-O, at 1150 – 950 cm 1) and the Si-O band at 800 cm 1, the latter representing specific silica bonds corresponding to hydrated amorphous SiO 4 tetrahedra. From the degree of change, a two-phase model with concurrent change in process was derived. In the first phase, a biologically controlled increase in thickness of the exo-polymeric polysaccharide sheath around the cell was observed. In phase two, a transition to an inorganically controlled accumulation of silica {{on the surface of the}} cyanobac-terial cells was derived from the change in integrated area for the mixed Si-O/C-O spectral region. This second process is further corroborated by the <b>synchronous</b> <b>formation</b> of non-microbially associated inorganic SiO...|$|E

Presence of crystalloids in tear “microdesiccates” is used to evaluate patients with Dry-Eye disease. This study aims to examine morphologically the desiccation process of normal tear fluid and to identify changes associated with accelerated tear evaporation. Tear microdesiccates from healthy (Non-Dry Eye) and Dry Eye subjects were produced at ambient conditions. Microdesiccate formation was monitored continuously by dark-field video microscopy. Additionally, accelerated desiccation of tear samples from healthy subjects was conducted under controlled experimental conditions. Particular morphological domains of tear microdesiccates and their progressive appearance during desiccation were compared. Results: In normal tear microdesiccates, four distinctive morphological domains (zones I, II, III and transition band) were recognized. Stepwise formation of those domains is now described. Experimentally accelerated desiccation resulted in marked changes {{in some of those}} zones, particularly involving either disappearance or size reduction of fern-like crystalloids of zones II and III. Tear microdesiccates from Dry Eye subjects may also display those differences and be the expression of a more <b>synchronous</b> <b>formation</b> of microdesiccate domains. Conclusion: Morphological characteristics of tear microdesiccates can provide insights into the relative rate of tear evaporation.

40|$|Encapsulation of prespore {{cells of}} Dictyostelium discoideum is {{controlled}} by several intercellular signals to ensure appropriate timing during fruiting body formation. Acyl-CoA-binding protein, AcbA, is secreted by prespore cells and processed by the prestalk protease TagC to form the 34 amino acid peptide SDF- 2 that triggers rapid encapsulation. AcbA is secreted when γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is released from prespore cells and binds to GrlE, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Analysis of SDF- 2 production in mutant strains lacking Gα subunits and GPCRs, either as pure populations or when mixed with other mutant strains, uncovered the non-cell-autonomous roles of GrlA, Gα 4 and Gα 7. We found that Gα 7 {{is essential for the}} response to GABA and is likely to be coupled to GrlE. GrlA-null and Gα 4 -null cells respond normally to GABA but fail to secrete it. We found that they are necessary for the response to a small hydrophobic molecule, SDF- 3, which is released late in culmination. Pharmacological inhibition of steroidogenesis during development blocked the production of SDF- 3. Moreover, the response to SDF- 3 could be blocked by the steroid antagonist mifepristone, whereas hydrocortisone and other steroids mimicked the effects of SDF- 3 when added in the nanomolar range. It appears that SDF- 3 is a steroid that elicits rapid release of GABA by acting through the GPCR GrlA, coupled to G protein containing the Gα 4 subunit. SDF- 3 is {{at the head of the}} cascade that amplifies the signal for encapsulation to ensure the rapid, <b>synchronous</b> <b>formation</b> of spores...|$|E
40|$|An {{outstanding}} {{question in}} Archean tectonics {{is the relationship}} between thick, depleted lithospheric keels that presently underlie the cratons and the overlying crustal section. Evidence for Archean diamonds and Re-Os model ages of cratonic peridotites argue for the development of stable lithospheric mantle early in a cratons history, at least in part <b>synchronous</b> with crust <b>formation</b> or stabilisation (Pearson 1999). The late tectonic evolution of cratons is complex and involves extensive magmatism, deformation, and metamorphism that significantly post-date the timing of crust formation. Many of these tectonic events are difficult to reconcile with early development of thick tectosphere and suggest that crust-mantle coupling and stabilization occurred late in the orogenic development of cratons. Over the past decade the Slave craton in northwestern Laurentia, has emerged as a major diamondiferous craton. The extensive and well documented geological record of the Slave craton, provides a new crustal perspective on the development of diamond-bearing tectosphere. In this contribution we describe the late tectonic evolution of the Slave craton based on field and geochronological studies, supplemented by geochronological data from lower crustal xenoliths to argue that stabilisation of the cratonic root, certainly to depths of 200 km, was most likely a late feature of the craton...|$|R
40|$|The Bicorb-Quesa diapir {{belongs to}} a complex system of {{evaporite}} diapirs located in the SE Iberian Peninsula. It was emplaced along the axis of a graben system flanked by two syn-diapir growth basins filled by Miocene sediments. The Miocene evolution of the diapir may be divided into three major phases: an initial extensional phase during which the graben system formed and the diapir rose; a second phase during which regional shortening closed the diapir; and a third phase characterized by normal faulting during which diapirism was reactivated, cutting the previously-formed thrusts and folds. This evolutionary trend demonstrates that diapirism was initiated and promoted by regional extension. During the two extensional phases, the diapir grew by reactive, active and passive rise. Sedimentation during the reactive stage was characterized by strong basin subsidence, sharp changes in sediment thicknesses, and major coarse-grained sediment input. During the active stage, the coeval basin-fill sequence displays progressive angular unconformities, gravitational deposits and subtle changes in thickness with the sediments unconformably overlying most of the earlier-formed faults. Finally, during the passive stage, the sediments <b>synchronous</b> with diapir <b>formation</b> include abundant components from the extruding rocks, and show gentler changes in thicknesses, a progressive decrease in the input of coarse sediments, and the deposition of mudstones and/or lacustrine carbonates that clearly extend onto the faulted basin margins.

40|$|The {{metamorphic}} sole {{along the}} base of the Semail ophiolite in Oman records the earliest thrust slice subducted and accreted to {{the base of}} the ophiolite mantle sequence. In the Bani Hamid area (United Arab Emirates) a c. 870 m thick thrust slice of granulite facies rocks includes garnet + diopside amphibolites, enstatite + cordierite + sillimanite + spinel ± sapphirine quartzites, alkaline mafic granulites (meta-jacupirangites) quartzo-feldspathic gneisses and calc-silicates. The latter contain garnet + diopside + scapolite + plagioclase ± wollastonite. P-T conditions of granulite facies metamorphism are in the range 800 - 860 °C and 10. 5 ± 1. 1 kbar to 14. 7 ± 2. 8 kbar. Garnet + clinopy-roxene + hornblende + plagioclase amphibolites from the metamorphic sole record peak P-T conditions of 840 ± 70 °C and 11. 6 ± 1. 6 kbar (THERMOCALC average P-T mode) and 840 - 870 °C and 13. 9 - 11. 8 kbar (conventional thermobarometry) with low degrees of partial melting producing very small melt segregations of tonalitic material. Pressure estimates are equivalent to depths of 57 - 46 km beneath oceanic crust, much deeper than can be accounted for by the thickness of the ophiolite. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar hornblende ages from the amphibolites range from 95 - 93 Ma, <b>synchronous</b> with <b>formation</b> of the plagiogranites in the ophiolite crustal sequence (95 Ma), eruption of the Lasail (V 2) volcanic sequence and deposition of Cenomanian-Turonian radiolaria in metalliferous sediments between the Geotimes (VI) and Lasail (V 2) lavas. Protoliths of the metamorphic sole were Triassic-Jurassic and early Cretaceous Haybi volcanic rocks, Exotic limestones and quartzites and were clearly not equivalent to the Semail ophiolite rocks, showing that initiation of subduction could not have occured at the ridge axis. Heat for metamorphism was derived from the mantle sequence harzburgites and dunites which were at or around 1100 - 1500 °C. All data from the sub-ophiolite metamorphic sole in Oman and the United Arab Emirates indicate that the ophiolite was formed in a Supra-Subduction zone setting and that obduction occured along a NE-dipping high-temperature subduction zone during Late Cretaceous times...|$|R
