40|$|The {{dissolution}} kinetics of tetrahedrite in aqueous alkaline <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfide</b> <b>solutions</b> {{was investigated}} in this present study. The effect of mineral particle size, reaction temperature, <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfide</b> and <b>sodium</b> hydroxide concentrations on the rate of dissolving antimony from tetrahedrite were studied. The result reveals {{that the rate of}} reaction increases with increasing reaction temperature, <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfide</b> concentration, <b>sodium</b> hydroxide concentration and with decreasing mineral particle size. The kinetics study indicates that tetrahedrite leaching rate by the lixiviant under the selected conditions is chemically controlled through the particle surface reaction. Therefore, the activation energy of antimony dissolution from tetrahedrite was estimated to be 81 kJ/ mol, which is in agreement with the value reported for the chemically controlled reactions process.

50|$|Today {{the term}} has become {{restricted}} to the person or the operator of the machinery which removes sheep's wool or the hair of other animals from hides in preparation for tanning.The process of fellmongering {{has to be done}} quickly after the animal is slaughtered to prevent the hides from decaying before tanning can begin. First they are trimmed of all unwanted pieces like legs, neck and tail then soaked in water to allow the skin tissues to distend. Next, a <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfide</b> <b>solution</b> is applied to the skin side of the fleece. The sodium sulphide soaks through the skin and destroys the follicles of the wool roots so that the fellmonger can then separate the wool from the skins. The wool is washed and dried. The skins are then soaked in a stronger solution of sodium sulphide and lime for 21 hours to remove small clumps of wool missed by the puller and to break down some internal proteins within the skin. The next process is called deliming: the skins are soaked in a solution of water and ammonium sulfate. This is to remove all the sodium sulphide from the skin and degraded proteins. The next process is the bating which is to remove any remaining protein from the surface.|$|E

40|$|Silicon nitride was {{deposited}} on copper substrates {{at room temperature}} by a reactive sputtering technique. The coatings, in the thickness range 500 - 1500 A, were amorphous, transparent, and had glass-like smoothness. They were tightly adherent to the substrate. Infrared analysis indicated the coatings were pure silicon nitride when precautions were taken to eliminate oxygen and water from the system. The coatings exhibited dielectric constants of 8 - 11 with a dissipation factor less than 10 - 2 at 1000 cycles/sec. The ductil ity ap-proached 1 % as measured on a copper substrate. The coatings reduced the charge passing across the metal/electrolyte interface when the coated samples were anodically treated in sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid. The coatings provided good resistance to attack of the copper surface in ammonium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite; provided moderate protection in concentrated acids, mediocre protection in sodium thiosulfate and <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfide</b> <b>solutions,</b> and very little protection in concentrated nitric acid...|$|R

Attractant mixtures based on 2 -mercaptoethanol, indole, butanoic/pentanoic acid, and a <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfide</b> <b>solution</b> gave 5 - to 20 -fold higher L. cuprina catches than the liver standard. These blends attracted similar numbers of Chrysomya spp. (0. 85 – 2. 7 ×) and fewer Calliphora spp. (0. 02 – 0. 2 ×) compared to the liver standard. These synthetic attractants were more effective and selective for L. cuprina than the standard liver/sodium sulfide attractant, and they can be packaged in controlled-release dispensers to generate constant, prolonged release of the attractant. ...|$|E
40|$|Under {{visible light}} irradiation, CdSe-nanoribbons photocatalyze H 2 {{evolution}} from aqueous <b>sodium</b> sulfite/ <b>sulfide</b> <b>solution</b> with a quantum efficiency of 9. 2 % at 440 nm, whereas bulk CdSe is not active for the reaction. Photoelectrochemical measurements {{show that the}} activity of nano-CdSe {{is caused by a}} raised flatband potential (- 0. 55 V, NHE) which follows from the increased bandgap (2. 7 eV) of this quantum confined material. In the presence of a sulfide ion, the flatband potential is fixed to- 0. 43 V (NHE), slightly below the sulfide redox potential (- 0. 48 V, NHE). When the nanoribbons are chemically linked to MoS 2 nanoplates that were obtained by exfoliation and ultrasonication of bulk MoS 2, the activity increases almost four times, depending on the mass percentage of MoS 2. Cyclic voltammetry reveals that the enhancement from the MoS 2 nanoplates is due to a reduction of the H 2 evolution overpotential. In contrast, chemical linkage of Pt nanoparticles to the nanoribbons does not affect the photocatalytic activity...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{dispersed}} olive-like NiS particles were synthesized in a liquid-liquid biphasic {{system at}} room temperature, where nickel xanthate in organic solvents (toluene and benzene) and <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfide</b> in water <b>solution</b> {{were used as}} nickel and sulfide sources, respectively. NiS particles were formed at the stabilized phase interface. The structures, chemical composition and optical characteristics of the products were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The organic solvents obviously influenced the morphology of the NiS particles. The olive-like NiS with smooth surface and sharp ends was obtained at benzene/water interface, while spindle-like NiS particles with rough surface and circle ends were formed when using toluene as a solvent. Analogously, chainlike Bi 2 S 3 nanowires were produced at chloroform/water interface.

30|$|The ZnS {{nanoparticles}} were synthesized {{using the}} chemical co-precipitation method as follows. First, ZnCl 2 was dissolved in double-distilled water (0.1 M), and then, the obtained molar solution was stirred for 20 min {{at room temperature}} to achieve complete dissolution. Sodium sulfide (Na 2 S) was also dissolved in double-distilled water separately as per molar concentration. Afterwards, first, <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfide</b> <b>solution</b> was added drop by drop to the zinc chloride solution, and then, an appropriate amount of 2 -mercaptoethanol as a capping agent {{was added to the}} reaction medium to control the particle size of ZnS. As a result of this, the white precipitate of the ZnS nanoparticles is formed slowly in the solution. In the final step, the obtained precipitate was filtered and dried at room temperature to remove both water and organic capping and other byproducts which formed during the reaction process. After sufficient drying, the precipitate was crushed to fine powder with the use of mortar and pestle. It is mentioned that the synthesis was done by passing nitrogen gas.|$|E
40|$|Iron sulfide phases are the {{ultimate}} repository of iron and reduced sulfur in sediments. The sulfur isotope geochemistry of pyrite has had much {{to tell us about}} modern and ancient Earth environments and it is likely that Fe isotopes will too, once fractionations for key processes are known. We report the results of an experimental study of Fe isotope fractionation on precipitation of FeS, synthetic mackinawite, from excess aqueous Fe(II) solutions by addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfide</b> <b>solution</b> at 2 – 40 °C. The results show a significant kinetic isotope effect {{in the absence of a}} redox process. No detectable effect of temperature on the fractionation factor was observed. The Fe isotope fractionation for zero-age FeS is ΔFe(II) –FeS = 0. 85 ± 0. 30 ‰ across the temperature range studied, giving a kinetic isotope fractionation factor of αFe(II) –FeS = 1. 0009 ± 0. 0003. On ageing, the FeS in contact with aqueous Fe(II) becomes progressively isotopically heavier, indicating that the initial fractionations are kinetic rather than equilibrium. From published reaction mechanisms, the opportunity for Fe isotope fractionation appears to occur during inner sphere ligand exchange between hexaqua Fe(II) and aqueous sulfide complexes. Fe isotope fractionation on mackinawite formation is expected to be most significant under early diagenetic situations where a readily available reactive Fe source is available. Since FeS(aq) is a key reactive component in natural pyrite formation, kinetic Fe isotope fractionations will contribute to the Fe isotope signatures sequestered by pyrite, subject to the relative rate of FeS 2 formation versus FeS–Fe(II) (aq) isotopic equilibration...|$|E
40|$|A {{system to}} {{generate}} a 1 - to 3 -gallon per minute stream of 350 F (177 C) simulated geothermal brine is discussed. A 10, 000 -gallon tank serves as the brine holding tank. The solution is prepared by diluting 26 % sodium chloride, derived from a Gulf Coast salt dome with steam condensate, deaerating, heating the brine to 350 F in a steam heat exchanger, injecting the desired cations and anions into a flowing stream with chemical injection pumps, and mixing with in-line mixers. Non-scaling cations are normally added to the 10, 000 -gallon base brine solution; anions, such as bicarbonate, silicate, etc. are injected as the sodium salts.
