40|$|I {{was taught}} that crystal growing is a knack (a special ready {{capacity}} {{that is hard}} to analyze and teach), not an art (a skill acquired by experience, study or observation). In some ways this is true, an art can be taught and learned, while a knack is <b>something</b> that <b>you</b> just <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> To me juggling is a knack, try as you might to teach me to juggle and you will fail. The same is true about crystal growing. We all know some people who can grow crystals quite by accident and some that could not grow a crystal if their science depended on it. With that said, there are techniques that could help even those of us who grow the worst crystals (or none at all). One story is told of a research group that could grow beautiful crystals of a compound in their old laboratories but when they moved to a new lab, they could not. It seems that the old lab was filled with “seed ” crystals in the form of dust particles and these microscopic crystals would perpetuate the crystallization flasks and “seed ” new crystal growth. Such variables can make or break a crystal grower; so much care must be taken to insure the number of random variables is kept to a minimum. With some practice you may find that you have the “touch ” for growing good crystals. If not maybe this sheet may help...|$|R
