Timothy Dwight--the [...] "old Timotheus" [...] who sang the Conquest of Cancan, instead of choosing a more popular subject, in the British Conquest of Canada--is of eldest date. Colonel Trumbull, whose hand, at various epochs of his life, was familiar with sword, pen, and pencil, contributes two letters, which lack the picturesqueness of execution that should distinguish the chirography of an artist. The value of Trumbull's pictures is of the same nature with that of daguerreotypes, depending not upon the ideal but the actual. The beautiful signature of Washington Irving appears as the indorsement of a draft, dated in 1814, when, if we may take this document as evidence, his individuality seems to have been merged into the firm of [...] "P. E. Irving & Co." [...] Never was anything less mercantile than this autograph, though as legible as the writing of a bank-clerk. Without apparently aiming at artistic beauty, it has all the Sketch Book in it. We find the <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> of Pierpont, the latter stamped with the poet's almost living countenance. What a pleasant device for a seal is one's own face, which he may thus multiply at pleasure, and send letters to his friends,--the Head without, and the Heart within! There are a few lines in the school-girl hand of Margaret Davidson, at nine years old; and a scrap of a letter from Washington Allston, a gentle and delicate autograph, in which we catch a glimpse of thanks to his correspondent for the loan of a volume of poetry. Nothing remains, save a letter from Noah Webster, whose early toils were manifested in a spelling-book, and those of his later age in a ponderous dictionary. Under date of February 10, 1843, he writes in a sturdy, awkward hand, very fit for a lexicographer, an epistle of old man's reminiscences, from which we extract the following anecdote of Washington, presenting the patriot in a festive light:-- ...|$|E

[...] With that wakefulness to {{the faintest}} indication which {{belongs to a}} mind habitually {{in a state of}} caution, Tito had detected by the glimmer of the lamp that the leader of the advancing group wore a red feather and a glittering sword-hilt--in fact, was almost the last person in the world he would have chosen to meet at this hour with Romola by his side. He had already during the day had one momentous interview with Dolfo Spini, and the business he had spoken of to Romola as yet to be done was a second interview with that personage, a sequence of the visit he had paid at San Marco. Tito, by a long-preconcerted plan, had been the bearer of letters to Savonarola--carefully-forged letters; one of them, by a stratagem, bearing the very <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> of the Cardinal of Naples, who of all the Sacred College had most exerted his influence at Rome in favour of the Frate. The purport of the letters was to state that the Cardinal was on his progress from Pisa, and, unwilling for strong reasons to enter Florence, yet desirous of taking counsel with Savonarola at this difficult juncture, intended to pause this very day at San Casciano, about ten miles from the city, whence he would ride out the next morning in the plain garb of a priest, and meet Savonarola, as if casually, five miles on the Florence road, two hours after sunrise. The plot, of which these forged letters were the initial step, was that Dolfo Spini with a band of his Compagnacci was to be posted in ambush on the road, at a lonely spot about five miles from the gates; that he was to seize Savonarola with the Dominican brother who would accompany him according to rule, and deliver him over to a small detachment of Milanese horse in readiness near San Casciano, by whom he was to be carried into the Roman territory.|$|E

One of {{the methods}} employed by eNotaries {{is the use of}} a digital <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> digital notary <b>seal</b> to notarize digital documents and validate with a digital certificate. Electronic notarization is a process whereby a notary affixes an electronic <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> notary <b>seal</b> using a secure Public key to an electronic document (such as a PDF or Word document). Once affixed to the electronic document, the document is rendered tamper evident such that unauthorized attempts to alter the document will be evident to relying parties.

The Electronic Notary also must keep an electronic register of each act performed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} novel offline {{signature}} verification scheme. The {{idea behind the}} extraction of stroke speed is to extract dynamic feature from a static signature. In order to obtain {{the speed of the}} stroke, the intensity of the stroke is considered. This is because intensity is directly proportional to speed of the stroke. Faster the stroke speed, higher is its intensity value. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate the ability of the proposed scheme in discriminating the genuine signatures from the forgeries. counterparts. So we developed a signature database which consists of signatures from all the age groups. Our database is also language independent and also it consists of signatures done with different pens with different colors along with these there are split <b>signatures</b> <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> <b>signatures.</b> The signature samples from the data base are shown in Figure 1...|$|R
