40|$|It {{has been}} a {{challenge}} to make seven straight round cylinders mutually touch before our now 10 -year old discovery [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 015505 (2004) ] of configurations of seven mutually touching infinitely long round cylinders (then coined 7 -knots). Because of the current interest in string-like objects and entanglement which occur in many fields of Physics {{it is useful to}} find a simple way to treat ensembles of straight infinite cylinders. Here we propose a treatment with a chirality matrix. By comparing 7 -knot with variable radii with the one where all cylinders are of equal radii (here 7 *-knot, which for the first time appeared in [phys. stat. solidi, b 246, 2098 (2009) ]), we show that the reduction of 7 -knot with a set of non-equal cylinder radii to 7 *-knot of equal radii is possible only for one topologically unique configuration, all other 7 -knots being of different topology. We found novel configurations for mutually touching infinitely long round cylinders when their numbers are eight and ultimately nine (here coined 8 -knots and 9 -knots). Unlike the case of 7 -knot, where one angular parameter (for a given set of fixed radii) may change by sweeping a <b>scissor</b> <b>angle</b> between two chosen cylinders, in case of 8 - and 9 -knots their degrees of freedom are completely exhausted by mutual touching so that their configurations are "frozen" for each given set of radii. For 8 -knot the radii of any six cylinders may be changeable (for example, all taken equal) while two remaining are uniquely determined by the others. We show that 9 -knot makes the ultimate configuration where only three cylinders can have changeable radii and the remaining six are determined by the three. Possible generalizations and connection with Physics are mentioned. Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E
