25|$|The {{district}} is primarily linear including properties {{on both sides}} of Greenwich Avenue from Putnam Avenue (U.S. Route 1) in the north to the New Haven Line tracks in the south. The district has an east-west bulge near its center where the Greenwich Municipal Center {{district is}} located. The bulge extends east along both sides of Havemeyer Place up to Millbank Street, and west across Havemeyer Field to Field Point Road, where the current Town Hall is located. The district is also drawn to include commercial blocks off Greenwich Avenue along the north side of Putnam Avenue, the north side of Lewis Street, the south side of Bruce Park, and the north side of Railroad Avenue. There are two <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> along Greenwich Avenue that contain modern buildings. The first is half a block on the east side just south of Putnam Avenue. The second is {{the east side of the}} intersection with Fawcett Place. The north, east, and west sides of the district are flanked by residential neighborhoods. Part of the north residential area is included in the Fourth Ward Historic District. In the south are the railroad tracks of the New Haven Line, the Connecticut Turnpike, and Greenwich Harbor.|$|E
2500|$|Common law agency {{tests of}} who is an [...] "{{employee}}" [...] take account of an employer's control, if the employee is in a distinct business, degree of direction, skill, who supplies tools, length of employment, method of payment, the regular business of the employer, what the parties believe, and whether the employer has a business. Some statutes also make <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> that reflect the common law, such as for independent contractors, and others make additional exceptions. In particular, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 §2(11) exempts supervisors with [...] "authority, {{in the interest of}} the employer", to exercise discretion over other employees' jobs and terms. This was originally a narrow exception. Controversially, in NLRB v Yeshiva University, a 5 to 4 majority of the Supreme Court held that full time professors in a university were excluded from collective bargaining rights, on the theory that they exercised [...] "managerial" [...] discretion in academic matters. The dissenting judges pointed out that management was actually in the hands of university administration, not professors. In NLRB v Kentucky River Community Care Inc, the Supreme Court held, again 5 to 4, that six registered nurses who exercised supervisory status over others fell into the [...] "professional" [...] exemption. Stevens J, for the dissent, argued that if [...] "the 'supervisor' is construed too broadly", without regard to the Act's purpose, protection [...] "is effectively nullified". Similarly, under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in Christopher v SmithKline Beecham Corp, the Supreme Court held 5 to 4 that a traveling medical salesman for GSK of four years was an [...] "outside salesman", and so could not claim overtime. People working unlawfully are often regarded as covered, so as not to encourage employers to exploit vulnerable employees. For instance in Lemmerman v AT Williams Oil Co, under the North Carolina Workers' Compensation Act an eight-year-old boy was protected as an employee, even though children working under the age of 8 was unlawful. However, in Hoffman Plastic Compounds v NLRB, the Supreme Court held 5 to 4 that an undocumented worker could not claim back pay, after being discharged for organizing in a union. The gradual withdrawal of more and more people from the scope of labor law, by a slim majority of the Supreme Court since 1976, means that the US falls below international law standards, and standards in other democratic countries, on core labor rights, including freedom of association.|$|E
40|$|<b>Specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> {{has become}} a {{controversial}} limitation on the doctrine of equivalents, which is itself an essential and controversial area of patent law. The doctrine of equivalents allows a patentee to successfully claim infringement against devices that are outside of the literal reach of the language used by the patentee in her patent to describe what she claims as her invention. The Supreme Court has prescribed some of the outer limits {{of the doctrine of}} equivalents and articulated the underlying policy concerns that inform its analysis-noting that courts should balance protection of the patentee 2 ̆ 7 s intellectual property with the public 2 ̆ 7 s reasonable expectations of the bounds of the patent-but has entrusted most of the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s development to the Federal Circuit. Critics argue that the Federal Circuit has applied <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion,</b> which precludes the doctrine of equivalents from reaching subject matter that is 2 ̆ 2 specifically excluded 2 ̆ 2 by the language used in the patent to describe the invention, {{in a way that does}} not adhere to the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s guidance on the doctrine of equivalents. The critics assert that the Federal Circuit has unduly narrowed the doctrine of equivalents by applying <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> too aggressively. This Note demonstrates that the critics 2 ̆ 7 extreme characterization of Federal Circuit <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> case law is unwarranted. The Federal Circuit has consistently and conscientiously applied <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion,</b> and their decisions conform to the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s guidance on the public notice function of patent claims. At the same time, the Federal Circuit has protected patentees by not allowing <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> to reduce the doctrine of equivalents to another test for literal infringement...|$|R

50|$|In an open perils policy, <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> will {{be stated}} in this section. These {{generally}} include earth movement, water damage, power failure, neglect, war, nuclear hazard, septic tank back-up expenses, intentional loss, and concurrent causation (for HO3). The concurrent causation exclusion excludes losses where both a covered and an excluded loss occur. In addition, the exclusion for building ordinance can mean that increased expenses due to local ordinances {{may not be}} covered. A 2013 survey of Americans found that 41% believed mold was covered, although it is typically not covered if the water damage occurs {{over a period of}} time, such as through a leaky pipe.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{policies}} {{will have their}} own <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions.</b> These can be extremely broad or narrow {{depending on the type}} of policy or the company that has issued the insurance. It is common to find exclusions listed on a policy that have been worded [...] "Directly Or Indirectly as a result". This means that even if the loss has occurred as an indirect case of an excluded item, the loss will not be covered in any way. It is for this reason that the insurance idea of proximate cause becomes so important. Underwriters will include exclusions to limit their risk to a specific type of loss.|$|E
5000|$|Many systems {{provide for}} <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> from taxable (chargeable) income. For example, several countries, notably Cyprus, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain, have enacted holding company regimes that exclude from income {{dividends}} from certain foreign subsidiaries of corporations. These systems generally impose tax on {{other sorts of}} income, such as interest or royalties, from the same subsidiaries. They also typically have requirements for portion and time of ownership {{in order to qualify}} for exclusion. The Netherlands offers a [...] "participation exemption" [...] for dividends from subsidiaries of Netherlands companies. Dividends from all Dutch subsidiaries automatically qualify. For other dividends to qualify, the Dutch shareholder or affiliates must own at least 5% and the subsidiary must be subject to a certain level of income tax locally.|$|E

5000|$|As {{transgender}} elders retire, {{they are}} often disadvantaged {{in the health care}} system. Medicare and many private health insurance coverages [...] "carry <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> for transition-related care, which are sometimes interpreted in practice to deny coverage to transgender people for even basic medical care". The Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has reiterated the provision of [...] "hormone replacement therapy and routine preventive care such as prostate screenings, mammograms, and pelvic exams, regardless of the gender marker in the individual’s Social Security record". These providers and the transgender patients are often unaware of such rules or of condition code 45, created by CMS in order to avoid automatic coverage denials in cases of gender discrepancies. Medicare also excludes sex reassignment surgery from its coverage, basing it as solely cosmetic. The policy [...] "also encourages private insurers, state Medicaid plans, and the veterans’ health care system to continue to allow similar exclusions that target care for transgender people".|$|E
