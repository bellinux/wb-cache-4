40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{algorithm}} for predicting low energy barrier folding pathways between conformational secondary structures {{of a single}} RNA molecule. Most existing heuristic algorithms guide the construction of folding pathways by free energies of intermediate structures in the next move during the folding. However due to the size and ruggedness of RNA energy landscape, energy-guided search can become trapped in local optima. Here, we propose an algorithm that guides the construction of folding pathways through the formation and destruction of RNA <b>stacks.</b> <b>Guiding</b> the construction of folding pathways by coarse grained movements of RNA stacks can help reduce the search space and {{make it easier to}} jump out of local optima. RNAEAPath is able to find lower energy barrier folding pathways between secondary structures of conformational switches and outperforms the existing heuristic algorithms in most test cases.

40|$|The new {{building}} of the Tallinn University of Technology (TUT) Library was opened in 2009. It has open stacks of about 210 000 volumes, which are located on 4 floors. The library has 32 study rooms and about 1 500 visits per day. In this paper some unique solutions are introduced, which have been worked out in cooperation between TUT librarians and library IT staff. Information kiosk. One single access point for searching in e-catalogue ESTER and ISE database, topographic Open <b>Stack</b> <b>Guide</b> (OSG), study rooms reservation system. OSG is integrated with ESTER item records. There {{are two ways to}} find the item location in open stacks: starting from ESTER or starting from OSG.

40|$|Abstract. Context-awareness {{has emerged}} as a key {{enabling}} technology for future smart homes. In this paper, we propose a generic layered model (the Context <b>Stack)</b> to <b>guide</b> the context-aware system design. We investigate the use of Semantic Web technologies in context modeling and reasoning. A Web Ontology based context model (CONON) is defined to facilitate explicit context representation, semantic context sharing, and logic reasoning. We show how the use of logic reasoning enables context-aware services to deduce high-level, implicit context from low-level, explicit context. In particular, we integrate the temporal ontology into our ontology model to facilitate annotating and reasoning about temporal context information. Following the general layered model, we present an OSGi-based context-aware service architecture for smart homes. We also build the smart home prototype with context-aware services. Index Terms:.

The primary functions of a blow-out preventer system are to confine well fluid to the wellbore, provide a way to add fluid to the wellbore and to allow controlled volumes of fluid to be withdrawn from the wellbore. Dive work includes assistance with guiding the blowout preventer stack (BOP <b>stack)</b> onto the <b>guide</b> base, inspection of the BOP stack, checking connections, troubleshooting malfunctions of the hydraulic, mechanical and electrical systems, and inspection of the rig's anchors.|$|R
40|$|Using first-principles {{calculations}} it {{is demonstrated}} that Co doped graphenelike ZnO sheet presents ferromagnetic coupling. The Co atoms are energetically barrierless {{absorbed in the}} Zn sites, suffering a Jahn-Teller distortion. The results reveal that {{the origin of the}} ferromagnetic coupling, different from the bulk 3 D ZnO <b>stacking,</b> is mainly <b>guided</b> by a direct exchange interaction without any additional defect. This ferromagnetic coupling is due to the system topology, namely, it is a direct consequence of the two-dimensional character of the ZnO monolayer within graphenelike structure. Increasing the number of ZnO layers the ferromagnetic coupling vanishes. FAPEMIGFAPESPCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) CNP...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle sensor {{to detect}} rain drop on and above {{waveguide}} utilizing light deflection and scattering was realized, keeping wide sensing coverage {{and sensitivity to}} detect mist accumulation. Proposed sensor structure under <b>stacked</b> light wave <b>guide</b> consisted of light blocking fixture surrounding photodetector and adjacent light source. Tilted air gap between stacked light waveguide and light blocking fixture played major role to increase sensitivity and to enhance linearity. This sensor structure eliminated complex collimating optics, while keeping wide sensing coverage using simple geometry. Detection algorithm based on time-to-intensity transformation process was used to convert raining intensity into countable raining process. Experimental result inside simulated rain chamber showed distinct different response between light rain and normal rain. Application as automobile rain sensor is expected...|$|R
40|$|Design and {{analysis}} of a new Abbé free coplanar xy stage are presented in this paper. The xy stage is formed as conventional xy stages which combine with two <b>stacked</b> up linear <b>guides.</b> The x-guide is {{on the bottom and}} the y-guide is on top of the x-guide. The travel range of this xy stage is 300 mm × 300 mm, which fits dimensions of 12 -inch wafers. A special mechanism is designed such that the z-surface of the y-guide has the same height as the z-surface of x-guide, and the Abbé error and cumulative error of this coplanar stage can be reduced. The concept of symmetric structure design is also considered to eliminate the structural deformation due to driving force of two guides. For this long travel range precision stage, the finite element method (FEM) is applied to analyze the structural deformation and vibration natural frequencies. The requirement of structural deformation due to self-weight load is limited to 1. 5 μm, and first natural frequency is limited to over 100 Hz...|$|R

A story in the New York Daily News published on June 10, 2007, stated [...] "dog fighting is a multi-million-dollar industry {{that is part of}} an underground subculture that holds its events in secret locations. It is extremely difficult for authorities to prove who has dogs for fighting purposes." [...] A few weeks later, in Buffalo, New York, police and animal control officers at the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter rescued 15 pit bulls believed to be part of dogfighting activities during a two-week period. Authorities found pit bulls — dead and alive — as well as [...] "dogfighting kits", which include harnesses, muzzles, pre-fight training <b>guides,</b> <b>stacks</b> of breeding papers, and even videos on dogfighting. [...] "We have been back to the same house three different times, and each time we pull out more and more dogs," [...] said Animal Control Officer Andrew Kleinfelder. [...] "Even when someone is arrested, a normal pit bull fighting ring has at least 30 people involved. Someone keeps the fights going." ...|$|R
40|$|Intermediate {{temperature}} (500 &ndash 700 °C) solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (IT&ndashSOFCs) with gadolinia&ndashdoped ceria (GDC) electrolytes have significant commercial potential due to reduced materials costs for seals and interconnect and improved performance with high oxide&ndashion conductivity at these temperatures. As an SOFC anode {{component in the}} reducing anode environments, GDC offers enhanced catalytic activity and tends to suppress carbon deposition in composite Ni/GDC anodes. The current study investigates relevant kinetics on GDC anodes for IT&ndashSOFC applications. Simultaneous electrochemical characterization and X&ndashray photoelectron spectroscopy of thin&ndashfilm Ni/GDC and Au/GDC electrochemical cells {{provide a basis for}} understanding pathways for H 2 and CO electrochemical oxidation as well as H 2 O splitting on GDC and GDC composite electrodes. Differences in electrochemical performance of Ni/GDC and Au/GDC electrodes at temperatures below 650 °C reveal limitations of GDC surfaces in promoting electrooxidation under conditions of low polaron (electron) mobility. These results also suggest the role of the metal in promoting hydrogen spillover to facilitate change transfer reactions at the Ni/GDC interface. Variation in OH - concentration at the metal/GDC interface with operating temperature, effective oxygen partial pressure, and electric bias provides valuable insight into the nature of electrochemical and other heterogeneous reactions in IT&ndashSOFC anodes. A detailed kinetic model for the GDC surface reactions and Ni/GDC charge&ndashtransfer reactions of H 2 oxidation and H 2 O electrolysis is developed based on electrochemical characterization and spectroscopic analysis of GDC surface electrochemistry. The thermodynamically consistent kinetic model is able to capture the observed chemical and electrochemical processes on the thin&ndashfilm Ni/GDC electrode. A full three&ndashdimensional IT&ndashSOFC stack model is developed with simplified kinetics to evaluate GDC&ndashbased anode performance with H 2 and methane&ndashderived fuels. The stack model explores the effects of operating condition on performance of stacks with GDC electrolytes and Ni/GDC anodes. The parametric study results of stack model provide essential information for optimizing performance of IT&ndashSOFCs <b>stack</b> and <b>guiding</b> IT&ndashSOFC design. Temperature distribution in non&ndashisothermal model result suggests that internal CH 4 reforming can be used as an effective thermal management strategy to maintain high current densities and cell voltages and to lower risk to thermo&ndashmechanical degradation...|$|R
