30|$|In this paper, we have {{discussed}} the landscape of physical-layer <b>security</b> <b>coding</b> metrics. We note that most measures in use today rely on information-theoretic analysis as blocklengths tend to infinity or use mean BER, both of which give asymptotic results that have limited meaning for short blocklength codes. We have proposed two new metrics that effectively employ CDFs to provide a lower bound on the security levels based on BER. Such an approach provides a stronger guarantee of secrecy over realistic channel models than simply using mean BER to estimate performance, and yet, our metrics retain their simplicity of calculation making them directly adaptable to real-world communication systems. The metrics apply generally to cases where concatenated codes are used to provide confidentiality, which includes as a special case the generic wiretap channel model. We have also shown how these new metrics {{may be used to}} reduce realistic channel model environments to simpler models over which known secrecy codes may be implemented to achieve information-theoretic security and have used them in performing basic cryptanalysis to aid system design.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} secrecy metrics {{applicable}} to physical-layer coding techniques with finite blocklengths over Gaussian and fading wiretap channel models and analyze their secrecy performance over several cases of concatenated code designs.

Our techniques are especially useful in cases where application of traditional information-theoretic security measures is either impractical or simply not yet understood. The metrics can aid both practical system analysis, including cryptanalysis, and practical system design when concatenated codes are used for physical-layer security.

30|$|The rest of {{the paper}} is {{organized}} as follows. First, we survey the landscape of secrecy metrics for physical-layer <b>security</b> <b>coding</b> schemes in Section 2. We then point out some shortcomings and motivate {{the need for additional}} practical metrics, and finally highlight the cases for which our metrics are superior to both information-theoretic and BER-based existing metrics, while also pointing out their limitations. Section 3 discusses the methodology behind our new metrics BE-CDF bc and BER-CDF ac, with definitions and clarifying examples. We show a use case of these metrics in a more complicated concatenated coding scheme in Section 4 and indicate how the scheme may be used directly for secrecy or used to provide a discrete memoryless wiretap channel equivalent over which additional secrecy codes may be used to achieve information-theoretic security. The scheme in this section uses a friendly jammer and illustrates the broad utility of the new metrics. We also compare and contrast our new metrics with traditional cryptographic strength and perform basic cryptanalysis {{both before and after the}} outer decoder for the nested coding framework.

40|$|In this work, a {{multilayer}} security {{solution for}} digital communication systems {{is provided by}} considering the joint effects of physical-layer security channel codes with application-layer cryptography. We address two problems: first, the cryptanalysis of error-prone ciphertext; second, {{the design of a}} practical physical-layer <b>security</b> <b>coding</b> scheme. To our knowledge, the cryptographic attack model of the noisy-ciphertext attack is a novel concept. The more traditional assumption that the attacker has the ciphertext is generally assumed when performing cryptanalysis. However, with the ever-increasing amount of viable research in physical-layer security, it now becomes essential to perform the analysis when ciphertext is unreliable. We do so for the simple substitution cipher using an information-theoretic framework, and for stream ciphers by characterizing {{the success or failure of}} fast-correlation attacks when the ciphertext contains errors. We then present a practical coding scheme that can be used in conjunction with cryptography to ensure positive error rates in an eavesdropper's observed ciphertext, while guaranteeing error-free communications for legitimate receivers. Our codes are called stopping set codes, and provide a blanket of security that covers nearly all possible system configurations and channel parameters. The codes require a public authenticated feedback channel. The solutions to these two problems indicate the inherent strengthening of security that can be obtained by confusing an attacker about the ciphertext, and then give a practical method for providing the confusion. The aggregate result is a multilayer security solution for transmitting secret data that showcases security enhancements over standalone cryptography.
