5|$|One of the Techniques {{most popular}} {{features}} is the <b>Sliver</b> Box, an analogue of the Vent {{feature of the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which allows readers to submit any comment they wish. Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the <b>Sliver</b> submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements {{in order to maintain}} a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the <b>Sliver</b> Box. Slivers were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at the bottom of each page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the <b>Sliver</b> Box.|$|E

Atom then tells {{everyone that}} she put it there in Kahndaq, {{and that it was}} this that has been causing Superman's illness and loss of control of his powers. The Outsider comes out of the shadows to pick up the box. He tells the heroes that the box is not magic, but science, that was created on his world and can only be opened by someone from his world. He explains that the box opens a gateway to his homeworld, and that he and Atom arrived following the weakening of the barriers between the universes resulting from the Justice League's battle with Darkseid.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} number of troops {{deployed}} by the belligerents vary considerably. Croatian forces have been estimated from under 100,000 to 150,000, but most sources put the figure at about 130,000 troops. ARSK troop strength in the Sectors North and South was estimated by the HV prior to Operation Storm at approximately 43,000. More detailed HV estimates of the manpower by individual ARSK corps indicated 34,000 soldiers, while Serb sources quote 27,000 troops. The discrepancy is usually reflected in literature as an estimate of about 30,000 ARSK troops. The ARBiH deployed approximately 3,000 troops against the ARSK positions near Bihać. In late 1994, the Fikret Abdić-led Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (APWB)a <b>sliver</b> of land northwest of Bihać between its ally RSK and the pocketcommanded 4,0005,000 soldiers who were deployed south of Velika Kladuša against the ARBiH force.|$|E
40|$|What are Bamboo Splits and <b>Slivers?</b> Bamboo splits and <b>slivers</b> are {{longitudinal}} sections of a bamboo pole (culm). Splits are the full {{thickness of the}} culm wall and have the green outer layer still attached. <b>Slivers</b> are thin, narrow sections of bamboo wood. They are the primary materials used for weaving {{a wide range of}} products. On a small scale they may be used for handicraft items and objects of daily use. On a large scale, one of the most useful products they can be woven into are the mats that are used to produce bamboo matboard. How are they produced? Splits and <b>slivers</b> may be produced by hand splitting or mechanical splitting. Hand splitting is suitable for small-scale production and there is a wide range of tools available, both traditional and modern. Automated splitting machines are more suitable for large-scale production of <b>slivers.</b> Fresh bamboo culms are passed through a series of machines that produce splits of successively smaller sizes until the desired size is reached. What is the market for bamboo splits and <b>slivers?</b> The market for bamboo splits is limited, because they are of limited use. However, bamboo <b>slivers</b> are the primary raw material for mat making and the demand for mats is closely related to the demand for matboard. Matboard is a versatile type of plywood and its markets are increasing rapidly. Often the splitting and <b>slivering</b> unit is established with very close linkages to the matboard factories and weaving facilities and weaving staff may be included in the unit. In some instances the splitting and <b>slivering</b> unit may be a subsidiary part of the matboard factory. What is the role of a bamboo splitting and <b>slivering</b> unit in rural development? The unit requires considerable supplies of raw bamboos, the management and harvesting of which increases employment opportunities for farmers and foresters. Establishing new plantations will benefit the environment and substituting bamboo for wood in products will help conserve natural forests. The unit offers employment opportunities for unskilled, semi-skilled and technically trained personnel for its operation and management. A large unit established with mat-weaving facilities included can provide employment for up to 400 people. How do I establish a bamboo splitting and <b>slivering</b> unit? A regular supply of raw bamboos, labour, electricity and an established market for the <b>slivers,</b> or the mats if mat weaving is included in the unit, is required. A large bamboo splitting and <b>slivering</b> unit with a production capacity of 1300 mats, 1. 2 x 2. 4 m per day, can be established for approximately US $ 300, 000. Smaller facilities can be established for considerably less, depending on their size and intended production rates. Bamboo splits and <b>slivers</b> are the primary materials used for weaving a wide range of product...|$|R

5|$|The MAUD {{reports were}} {{reviewed}} by the Defence Services Panel of the Scientific Advisory Committee. This was chaired by Lord Hankey, with its other members being Sir Edward Appleton, Sir Henry Dale, Alfred Egerton, Archibald Hill and Edward Mellanby. The panel held seven meetings in September 1941, and submitted its report to the Lord President of the Council, Sir John Anderson. At this point it was feared that German scientists were attempting to provide their country with an atomic bomb, and thus Britain needed to finish its first. The report ultimately stated {{that if there were}} even a <b>sliver</b> of a chance that the bomb effort could produce a weapon with such power, then every effort should be made to make sure Britain did not fall behind. It recommended that while a pilot separation plant be built in Britain, the production facility should be built in Canada. The Defence Services Panel submitted its report on 24 September 1941, but by this time the final decision had already been taken. Lord Cherwell had taken the matter to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who became the first national leader to approve a nuclear weapons programme on 30 August 1941. The Chiefs of Staff Committee supported the decision.|$|E
5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. As the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a <b>sliver</b> of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E

For obvious reasons, users {{do not have access}} to <b>slivers</b> they do not own, and cannot predict when they will be executed. As such, our experiments were occasionally influenced by other <b>slivers</b> running at the same time. This was especially notorious in the node acting as the server, as the network bandwidth could reduce suddenly and drastically. We were able to identify these incorrect experiments due to their unusually long execution time, and through the use of HTTP commands to occasionally download files from the server.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} the control volume {{algorithm}} for the solution of Poisson’s equation in three dimensions will converge even if the mesh contains a class of very flat tetrahedra (<b>slivers).</b> These tetrahedra are characterized {{by the fact that}} they have modest ratios of diameter to shortest edge, but large circumscribing to inscribed sphere radius ratios, and therefore may have poor interpolation properties. Elimination of <b>slivers</b> is a notoriously difficult problem for automatic mesh generation algorithms. We also show that a discrete Poincaré inequality will continue to hold in the presence of <b>slivers...</b>|$|R

25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous <b>sliver.</b> The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the front rollers, draw out the material into a continuous <b>sliver.</b> From the front rollers the <b>sliver</b> of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the combing machine.|$|E
