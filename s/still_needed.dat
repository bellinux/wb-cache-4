5|$|Despite these {{organs of}} {{military}} occupation, and the orders issued by OKH, regulating {{as they did}} {{a wide range of}} administrative, political, economic, cultural and social matters, the Germans <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> to establish a public administrative body that would implement their directives. It was decided to establish a puppet government for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Lawrence {{introduced}} Mars to {{his future}} A manager at Atlantic Records, Aaron Bay-Schuck. After hearing him play {{a couple of}} songs on the guitar, Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately, but it took roughly three years for Atlantic records to finally sign Mars to the label, because they felt {{it was too early}} and that he <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> to develop as an artist.|$|E

5|$|The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) {{ended the}} Mexican–American War, but left issues {{affecting}} both sides that <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> to be resolved: {{possession of the}} Mesilla Valley, protection for Mexico from Indian raids, {{and the right of}} transit in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E
5|$|A despondent Bart is told by Lisa {{that he is}} <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> as Milhouse's {{friend and}} confidant, and Bart eagerly accepts this new role. However, Milhouse finds his own job {{intolerable}} and disappears, right during the filming {{of the most expensive}} scene in the movie. The film is suspended while the townspeople search for Milhouse. Eventually, Bart finds him in his treehouse, and despite encouragement from former child star Mickey Rooney, Milhouse gives up on his acting career. With the film now cancelled and the producers bankrupt, the directors return to Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|A second Overmind {{is created}} in Brood War, formed from {{the merging of}} several cerebrates. This second Overmind never reaches full maturity, and thus lacks the power and {{intelligence}} of the original and is much weaker; attacks that were superficial to the first Overmind send the second into remission, although dark templar energies are <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> to kill it. The second Overmind is captured and drugged by the United Earth Directorate, who use its control of the Swarm to bolster its own forces in the Koprulu Sector, but it is ultimately slain by Zeratul.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{important}} in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release {{only a small amount}} of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.|$|E
5|$|Dickens {{returned}} to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised {{on the success of}} the book by publishing other Christmas stories The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848); these were secular conversion tales which reflected the societal changes of the previous year, and which social problems <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> to be dealt with. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.|$|E
5|$|He then scored 73 run out, {{his only}} fifty in the Tests, as Australia made 491 and ceded a 136-run {{lead in the}} third Test at Old Trafford. However, they held on for a draw. Woodfull made a duck in the fourth Test at Headingley, but another Bradman triple century put them in control before rain {{shortened}} the match; England <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> 155 runs to make Australia bat again with only four wickets in hand when the match ended. The draw meant that the series was at 1–1 heading into the final Test at The Oval, which would be timeless.|$|E

5|$|In December 2000, Ben Stiller was {{in discussions}} to star as Chuck Barris, with Bryan Singer {{directing}} and Clooney still aboard. However, Stiller {{was forced to}} vacate Confessions due to scheduling conflicts with Zoolander (2001) and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001). Although Singer was interested in Sam Rockwell in the lead role, the director cast Johnny Depp to replace Stiller and commenced pre-production in January 2001 on a planned $35 million budget. Renaissance Pictures was holding international distribution rights, but the filmmakers <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> more financing {{as well as a}} studio to cover distribution duties in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Since the T65 {{project was}} fading away, the Armored Force <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> a light {{anti-aircraft}} vehicle, so {{they made a}} new project (called T65E1) based on the new T24 chassis (a prototype of the M24 Chaffee). The T65E1 had the same overall layout as the T65 GMC – gun turret at rear with the engines {{in the middle of}} the chassis – with a few minor tweaks (including an angular gun shield instead of a straight one).|$|E
5|$|Two more Fat Man {{assemblies}} were readied, {{and scheduled}} to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on August 11 and 14, and Tibbets was ordered by LeMay {{to return to}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, to collect them. At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> to be pressed and coated, which would take until August 16. Therefore, {{it could have been}} ready for use on August 19. Unable to reach Marshall, Groves ordered on his own authority on August 13 that the core should not be shipped.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the mid-3rd {{century the}} {{emperors}} began to favor {{members of the}} equestrian order over senators, who had had a monopoly {{on the most important}} offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as it was felt that they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors, however, <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{was given}} another life at 108 when he {{advanced}} two metres down the pitch to Jim Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 1/292 having added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed for 182, having partnered Bradman in {{a stand of}} 301 in 217 minutes. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. He struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling with eight runs <b>still</b> <b>needed.</b> Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. This sealed an Australian victory by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 with 29 fours in only 255 minutes.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} Rome's entire {{position}} on the Rhine and even in Gaul was imperiled. Their civil war over, the Romans mustered a huge task force of eight legions (five dispatched from Italy, two from Spain and one from Britain) to deal with Civilis. Its commander Petillius Cerialis had to fight two difficult battles, at Trier and Xanten, before he could overrun the Batavi's homeland. Tacitus' surviving narrative breaks off as he describes a meeting on {{an island in the}} Rhine delta between Civilis and Cerialis to discuss peace terms. We do not know the outcome of this meeting or Civilis' ultimate fate. But in view of his former friendship with Vespasian, who had already offered him a pardon, {{and the fact that the}} Romans <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> the Batavi levies, it is likely that the terms were lenient by Roman standards.|$|E

5|$|Groves {{expected}} to have another atomic bomb ready for use on 19 August, with three more in September and a further three in October. Two more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on 11 and 14 August. At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> to be pressed and coated, which would take until 16 August. It could therefore have been ready for use on 19 August. On 10 August, Truman secretly requested that additional atomic bombs not be dropped on Japan without his express authority. Groves suspended the third core's shipment on his own authority on 13 August.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{was given}} another life on 136, when Laker dropped him at square leg from the bowling of Compton. Bradman was given another life at 108; he {{advanced}} two metres down the pitch towards Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 1/292 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, after hitting a tired-looking shot to mid-off, having partnered Bradman for {{a stand of}} 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting. Australia <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> 46 for victory, {{and went on to}} win by seven wickets with 15 minutes to spare, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before Golden Abyss, Guerro {{had enough}} money to equip his army with guns, turrets, {{vehicles}} and explosives, but <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> more. He was approached by an archaeologist, Vincent Perez, and his partner Jason Dante, who wished to investigate ruins within Guerro's territory on a potential lead to Quivira, one of the Seven Cities of Gold. Guerro agreed, presumably planning to kill both Perez and Dante {{when he had the}} gold, which he would use to fund the revolution. After Perez's disappearance, he allowed Dante to take over the excavation only if he complied with orders. Guerro interrogates both Chase and Dante after he captures Drake. Chase manages to escape with Drake and her amulet. Guerro captures Chase and steals the sword of Stephen from Drake. Drake and Sully find the Serpent Temple where Dante's mercenaries and Guerro's thugs are fighting.Guerro wounds Chase badly before being thrown off a bridge by Nate.|$|E
