500|$|During her {{sea trials}} in November 1916 off the River Tyne, Courageous {{sustained}} structural damage while running {{at full speed}} in a rough head sea. The forecastle deck was deeply buckled in three places between the breakwater and the forward turret. In addition, the <b>side</b> <b>plating</b> was visibly buckled between the forecastle and upper decks. Water had entered the submerged torpedo room and rivets had sheared in the vertical flange of the angle iron securing the deck armour in place. The exact cause remains uncertain, but Courageous received [...] of stiffening in response; Glorious did not receive her stiffening until 1918. Courageous also was temporarily fitted as a minelayer in April 1917, but never actually laid any mines. In mid-1917 both ships received a dozen torpedo tubes in pairs: one mount {{on each side of}} the mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts {{on each side of the}} rear turret on the quarterdeck. Courageous and Glorious served together throughout the war. Both ships were initially assigned to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron and later reconstituted the 1st Cruiser Squadron (CS).|$|E

At approximately the same time, Posen accidentally rammed the light cruiser [...] and holed her below the waterline. Elbing was damaged so severely that her engine room was completely flooded and she was unable to move; the captain of the ship ordered Elbing be scuttled to prevent her capture by the British.|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in Brest, Gneisenau {{was the subject}} of repeated British air raids. The first attack took place on the night of 30–31 March, and a second occurred on 4–5 April. During the second raid, a [...] armor-piercing (AP) bomb narrowly missed the ship. As a result of the attacks, the ship was moved out of the dry dock and moved to the harbor. On 6 April, the ship was attacked by British torpedo bombers, which managed to score a single hit. The Bristol Beaufort that struck the ship was piloted by Flying Officer Kenneth Campbell. The torpedo struck Gneisenau {{in the vicinity of the}} rear main battery turret. Some [...] of water flooded the ship and caused a 2degree list to starboard. The flooding also disabled several components of the ship's propulsion system. The explosion caused significant destruction to the <b>side</b> <b>plating</b> as well as the starboard and centerline propeller shafts. The concussive shock also caused widespread damage to the ship's electronic components. A salvage tug came alongside to assist in the pumping effort. Following the attack, Gneisenau returned to the drydock for repairs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} stress distribution of <b>side</b> <b>plates</b> on the logging truck’s cable reel, {{and find the}} cause of <b>side</b> <b>plates</b> cracking, an elastic-plastic finite element model of three-dimension is set up. Based {{on a series of}} computations, the distributions of displacement and equivalent stress under the working conditions are analyzed, as well as the influence of the number of <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> floors on stress distribution. The results indicate the maximum equivalent stress is on the outside connection between <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> and cable reel, and the floors take the most part loads from steel cables. When the number of floors is greater than 11, increasing the floor number will not decrease the maximum equivalent stress obviously. The conclusion provides useful method and foundation for resolving floor cracking on logging trucks...|$|R

500|$|Evan-Thomas {{continued}} his turn until his ships were steering due north, which interposed the 5th Battle Squadron between Scheer's battlecruisers, which had reversed course around 16:48 to follow Beatty north, and Beatty's ships. While making the turn, Barham {{was struck by}} two 30.5-centimetre shells beginning at 16:58, probably from the battlecruiser [...] The first of these struck the ship's upper deck before detonating upon striking the main deck above the medical store compartment, which was completely burnt out. The detonation blew a [...] hole in the main deck, sent fragments through the middle and lower decks and burned out the casemate for starboard No. 2 six-inch gun. Three minutes later another shell hit the aft superstructure, severing the antenna cables of the main wireless station. One fragment ricocheted off the upper deck and through the <b>side</b> <b>plating</b> {{on the opposite side}} of the ship. Either the first or the fourth of these shells destroyed the ship's sickbay, killing the staff and all of its patients, including eight ship's boys. Barham returned fire at the battlecruisers at 17:02, together with Valiant, the two northernmost of Evan-Thomas's ships, and the two of them made three hits on the battlecruiser [...] and Lützow between 17:06 and 17:13 while Barham was hit twice more by Derfflinger; [...] although neither of them did any significant damage. In contrast, the hit on Lützow flooded a [...] magazine and the hits on Seydlitz blew a [...] hole in the side of her bow. Fragments from this hit caused flooding that spread throughout the bow, while the ship's speed caused water to enter directly though the hole in the side. Other fragments from the second hit caused damage that allowed the water to spread even further. These two hits were ultimately responsible for the massive flooding that nearly sank the ship after the battle. The third shell detonated on the face of the starboard wing turret, although some fragments entered the turret and caused minor damage.|$|E

She {{arrived at}} the Dardanelles on 24 January 1915 where she replaced Indefatigable as the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet. She bombarded Turkish fortifications on 19 February, {{the start of the}} Battle of Gallipoli, to little effect, and again on 15 March, with the same results. She was part of the first line of British ships on 18 March as they attempted to suppress the Turkish guns so the minefields could be swept. Turkish return fire was heavy and she was hit a number of times. A [...] howitzer shell knocked out the left gun of 'P' turret, a [...] shell hit the yard above the foretop and killed or wounded everybody within. A heavy shell of unknown size hit her on the port side [...] below the waterline, but only dished in the <b>side</b> <b>plating.</b> A [...] shell hit the foremast at the same level as the flying bridge and set fire to the navigator's sea cabin. The hit destroyed all the cables and voice pipes running through the foremast to the fire control director. The smoke from the fire was choking the wounded so she withdrew to turn her head to into the wind and the fire was then quickly put out. She returned to reengage the Turkish forts and was hit once more with little effect. Later, as she was turning in Eren Keui Bay, she was seriously damaged by a mine, probably about [...] in size, that blew a large hole in her starboard bow and flooded the forward torpedo flat, drowning 39 men. She had to be beached at the island of Bozcaada (Tenedos) to prevent her sinking, as she had taken in some [...] of water, but she was temporarily repaired with a cofferdam over the [...] hole. She sailed to Malta, escorted by [...] and [...] on 6 April. She nearly foundered when her cofferdam worked loose in heavy weather en route and had to be towed stern-first by Canopus for six hours while the cofferdam was repaired. She was under repair at Malta until early June before she sailed for home. She reached the U.K. on 19 June where she joined the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) of the Grand Fleet under the command of Rear Admiral H.L.A. Hood.|$|E

6000|$|Eblis, Gehenna's next astern, at once fired a torpedo at {{the second}} ship in the German line, a four-funnelled cruiser, and hit her between the second funnel and the mainmast, when [...] "she {{appeared}} to catch fire fore and aft simultaneously, heeled right over to starboard, and undoubtedly sank." [...] Eblis loosed off a second torpedo and turned aside to reload, firing {{at the same time}} to distract the enemy's attention from Gehenna, who was now ablaze fore and aft. Gehenna's acting sub-lieutenant (the only executive officer who survived) says that by the time the steam from the broken pipe cleared he found Gehenna stopped, nearly everybody amidships killed or wounded, the cartridge-boxes round the guns exploding one after the other as the fires took hold, and the enemy not to be seen. Three minutes or less did all that damage. Eblis had nearly finished reloading when a shot struck the davit that was swinging her last torpedo into the tube and wounded all hands concerned. Thereupon she dropped torpedo work, fired at an enemy searchlight which winked and went out, and was closing in to help Gehenna when she found herself under the noses of a couple of enemy cruisers. [...] "The nearer one," [...] he says, [...] "altered course to ram me apparently." [...] The Senior Service writes in curiously lawyer-like fashion, but there is no denying that they act quite directly. [...] "I therefore put my helm hard aport and the two ships met and rammed each other, port bow to port bow." [...] There could have been no time to think and, for Eblis's commander on the bridge, none to gather information. But he had observant subordinates, and he writes--and I would humbly suggest that the words be made the ship's motto for evermore--he writes, [...] "Those aft noted" [...] that the enemy cruiser had certain marks on her funnel and certain arrangements of derricks on each side which, quite apart from the evidence she left behind her, betrayed her class. Eblis and she met. Says Eblis: [...] "I consider I must have considerably damaged this cruiser, as 20 feet of her <b>side</b> <b>plating</b> was left in my foc'sle." [...] Twenty feet of ragged rivet-slinging steel, razoring and reaping about in the dark on a foc'sle that had collapsed like a concertina! It was very fair plating too.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sliding hip screw (SHS) {{fixation}} traditionally {{involves the}} use of 4 -hole side plates; however, 4 -hole plates have disadvantages, including longer surgery and greater postoperative pain, and {{there is little evidence that}} they provide increased stability. We compared 2 - and 4 -hole <b>side</b> <b>plates</b> in stable and unstable pertrochanteric fractures. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with pertrochanteric femoral fractures treated between Jan. 1, 2004, and Apr. 30, 2009, with a 135 ° SHS using either a 2 - or 4 -hole <b>side</b> <b>plate,</b> based on surgeon preference. RESULTS: A total of 327 patients were managed with an SHS device (252 women, 75 men). There were 208 stable fracture patterns (AO/OTA 31 A 1, A 2. 1) and 119 unstable (AO/OTA 31 A 2. 2, A 2. 3, A 3). We managed 172 patients with 2 -hole plates and 155 with 4 -hole plates. The average duration of surgery (30. 44 v. 51. 45 min), blood loss (26. 0 v. 31. 3 g/L) and transfusion requirements (43 % v. 31. 60 % transfusion) were significantly lower with the 2 -hole than the 4 -hole plate. There was no significant difference in length of stay (19 v. 16 d). With stable fractures there was no significant difference in failure rate (6. 3 % v. 4. 9 %). In unstable fractures there was a significantly higher rate of failure using 2 -hole <b>side</b> <b>plates</b> (24. 4 % v. 10. 8 %). CONCLUSION: In stable fractures, use of an SHS with a 2 -hole <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> results in shorter surgery and less blood loss/transfusion than a 4 -hole <b>side</b> <b>plate,</b> with equivalent survival. In unstable fractures, there is a greater than 2 -fold rate of failure when a 2 -hole <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> is used. Robert Peter Baird, Peter O’Brien, David Cruickshan...|$|R
