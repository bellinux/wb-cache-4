40|$|An {{integral}} {{component in}} the development of a control strategy for implantable rotary blood pumps is the task of reliably detecting the occurrence of left ventricular collapse due to overpumping of the native heart. Using the noninvasive pump feedback signal of impeller speed, an approach to distinguish between overpumping (or ventricular collapse) and the normal pumping state has been developed. Noninvasive pump signals from 10 human pump recipients were collected, and the pumping state was categorized as either normal or suction, based on expert opinion aided by transesophageal echocardiographic images. A number of indices derived from the pump <b>speed</b> <b>waveform</b> were incorporated into a classification and regression tree model, which acted as the pumping state classifier. When validating the model on 12, 990 segments of unseen data, this methodology yielded a peak sensitivity/specificity for detecting suction of 99. 11 %/ 98. 76 %. After performing a 10 -fold cross-validation on all of the available data, a minimum estimated error of 0. 53 % was achieved.

40|$|All rotary blood pumps (RBPs) {{are prone}} to {{the harmful effects of}} {{ventricular}} collapse or "suction events" because of over-pumping, because they are inherently preload insensitive devices, yet RBP controllers do not comprise a clinically reliable suction detector. We therefore investigated the clinical performance of seven expertly selected time domain indices of suction based on the observed positive spike induced in the RBP impeller <b>speed</b> <b>waveform.</b> Using expert panel classifications, a balanced set of 404 five-second speed snapshots of normal and suction events was created from the impeller speed 25 Hz data in 12 VentrAssist implant patients. Initially, suction index threshold levels were set differently for each patient, giving best sensitivity 95 % and specificity 99 %. However, analysis of paired combinations of suction indices with fixed thresholds identified one pair giving an acceptable sensitivity of 99. 5 % and specificity 97. 5 %; the low number of high speed data samples relative to the speed snapshot mean and maximum OR the largest increase in successive speed maxima. The additional precondition of RBP speed amplitude exceeding a low threshold level allows its more general application to patients with low cardiac contractility.

It focuses on a powerful 20 -cylinder diesel engine with crankshaft natural frequencies within the operating speed range. First, the angular speed variations are modeled at the crankshaft free end.

A model with the assumption of a flexible crankshaft is required. The excitation torques depend on the in-cylinder pressure curve. The latter is modeled with a phenomenological model. Mechanical and combustion parameters of the model are optimized {{with the help of}} actual data. Then, an automated diagnosis based on an artificially intelligent system is proposed.

A digital circuit, which includes a microprocessor, samples and processes the raw speed data. The numerical analysis includes data noise filtering, and the numerical determination of front end and flywheel <b>speed</b> <b>waveforms.</b> When operating without external load, the engine accelerates only the inertial load. When neglecting friction and {{the small amount of}} torsional energy in the crankshaft, it is shown that the engine energy can be modeled as a lumped parameter system consisting of inertia on both engine front and flywheel ends, coupled by a torsional spring. The results from measurements on an eight-cylinder diesel engine with various cylinder faults show that reduced cylinder performance produces a drop of kinetic energy for the faulty cylinder.

In addition, development of valve abnormalities after Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) implantation is common among patients with advanced HF, likely due {{the fact that the}} LVAD alters haemodynamics by changing the direction of blood flow from the apex of the heart, largely bypassing the left ventricle (LV), directly to the aorta. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the hemodynamic interaction between the LVAD and aortic valve (AV) using 2 D LV LVAD computational models. To investigate the correlation between AV status and LVAD motor speed, this study perfomed a detailed computational analysis of left ventricular flow and mechanics during LVAD support.

The NR simulations expand the domain of calibration toward larger mass ratios and spins, as compared to the previous EOBNR model. Merger-ringdown waveforms computed in black-hole perturbation theory for Kerr spins close to extremal provide additional inputs to the calibration. For the inspiral-plunge phase, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently explore the calibration space. For the merger-ringdown phase, we fit the NR signals with phenomenological formulae. After extrapolation of the calibrated model to arbitrary mass ratios and spins, the (dominant-mode) EOBNR waveforms have faithfulness—at design Advanced-LIGO sensitivity—above 99 % against all the NR waveforms, including 16 additional waveforms used for validation, when maximizing only on initial phase and time. This implies a negligible loss in event rate due to modeling for these binary configurations. We find that future NR simulations at mass ratios ≳ 4 and double spin ≳ 0. 8 will be crucial to resolving discrepancies between different ways of extrapolating waveform models. We also find that some of the NR simulations that already exist in such region of parameter space are too short to constrain the low-frequency portion of the models.

Optical counterparts may be short-lived so rapid characterization of gravitational wave (GW) events is paramount for discovering electromagnetic signatures. One way {{to meet the demand}} for rapid GW parameter estimation is to trade off accuracy for <b>speed,</b> using <b>waveform</b> models with simplified treatment of the compact objects' spin. We report on the systematic errors in GW parameter estimation suffered when using different spin approximations to recover generic signals. Component mass measurements can be biased by > 5 σ using simple-precession waveforms and in excess of 20 σ when non-spinning templates are employed. This suggests that electromagnetic observing campaigns should not take a strict approach to selecting which LIGO/Virgo candidates warrant follow-up observations based on low-latency mass estimates. For sky localization, we find searched areas are up to a factor of ∼ 2 larger for non-spinning analyses, and are systematically larger for any of the simplified waveforms considered in our analysis. Distance biases for the non-precessing waveforms can be in excess of 100 % and are largest when the spin angular momenta are in the orbital plane of the binary. We confirm that spin-aligned waveforms should be used for low-latency parameter estimation at the minimum. Including simple precession, though more computationally costly, mitigates biases except for signals with extreme precession effects. Our results shine a spotlight on the critical need for development of computationally inexpensive precessing waveforms and/or massively parallel algorithms for parameter estimation.

The microstructure is controlled by different factors such as heat and mass transfer occurring in the weld pool. Different parameters as welding <b>speed</b> and current <b>waveform</b> lead to different microstructure morphologies. Experimental tests with different parameters were conducted on CuNi plate with in situ observation around the solidifying interface to evaluate {{the microstructure}} evolution. This setup allows to observe and to investigate the dendritic growth around the semi-solid zone. Some EBSD maps were performed for different process parameters and are used for comparison. To model microstructure generation, cellular automaton (CA) have proven its versatility. It can model complex phenomena of solidification such as grain growth, grain competition, nucleation and Columnar to Equiaxed Transition. One of the main ingredient to model the microstructure morphology is the dendritic growth model that {{is linked to the}} undercooling. The objective {{of this paper is to}} compare experimental results with some cellular automaton results and to discuss the modelling of dendritic growth model under different solidification conditions...|$|R
