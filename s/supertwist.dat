We have demonstrated that either protein can introduce superhelical turns into relaxed closed-circular DNA and that the presence of chromatin extract is necessary for the <b>supertwisting</b> effect. A greater density of superhelical turns was produced by pVII than by VII, but neither protein-DNA interaction resulted in the "physiological" amount of <b>supertwisting</b> produced by histones.

5000|$|Briefly, the {{alterations}} of s {{seen in the}} pH {{titration curve}} above are widely thought {{to be due to}} changes in the superhelical winding of DNA under conditions of increasing pH.

Since there is less and less strain to be relieved by superhelical winding, the superhelices therefore progressively disappear as the pH increases. At a pH just below 12, all incentive for superhelicity has expired, and the chromosome will appear as a relaxed, open circle.|$|E

Here electron microscopic and cyclization studies were carried out on alpha/beta-type SASP-DNA complexes. When an alpha/beta-type SASP was incubated with linear DNA, the protein bound cooperatively, forming a helical coating 6. 6 +/- 0. 4 nm wide with a 2. 9 +/- 0. 3 nm periodicity. alpha/beta-Type SASP binding to an 890 -bp DNA was weakest at an (A+T) -rich region that was highly bent, but binding eliminated the bending. alpha/beta-Type SASP binding did not alter the rise per bp in DNA but greatly increased the DNA stiffness as measured by both electron microscopic and cyclization assays. Addition of alpha/beta-type SASPs to negatively <b>supertwisted</b> DNA led to protein binding without significant alteration of the plectonemically interwound appearance of the DNA. Addition of alpha/beta-type SASPs to relaxed or nicked circular DNA led to molecules that by electron microscopy appeared similar to <b>supertwisted</b> DNA.

40|$|In {{reactions}} catalyzed by the RecA protein of Escherichia coli, synapsis {{between two}} DNA molecules {{is believed to}} occur {{even in the absence}} of free homologous DNA ends and to involve a metastable interaction termed paranemic joining. We have used electron microscopic methods to visualize synapse formation between <b>supertwisted</b> M 13 double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and linear M 13 mp 7 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with non-M 13 sequences at its ends. These non-M 13 sequences block strand invasion and make this pairing equivalent to the joining of two fully circular molecules. We observed a high frequency of joining when the ssDNA was initially assembled into presynaptic filaments with RecA protein. Cleavage of the dsDNA in the joined complexes by Hpa I revealed that the joint was at a site of homology. In these joints, the dsDNA entered the presynaptic filament over a length of 360 +/- 80 base pairs, not visibly altering its ultrastructure, and then dissociated from the filament. Although the dsDNA in the complexes appeared topologically relaxed, deproteinization released <b>supertwisted</b> dsDNA, indicating that the dsDNA was unwound by 34 degrees per base pair in the paranemic joint. When <b>supertwisted</b> M 13 dsDNA was paired with circular M 13 ssDNA, similar joints were observed and both DNA circles appeared topologically relaxed...|$|R

40|$|After isolation, the DNA of {{simian virus}} 40 {{appeared}} as a negative <b>supertwist</b> (form I) or as an open circle {{with at least one}} single-strand scission (form II). Under the denaturation conditions usually applied, such as heating in the presence of formaldehyde or application of alkali, form I molecules could appear as "relaxed" circles without single-strand scissions (form I') containing denatured sites not visible under the electron microscope. Form II molecules, under these denaturation conditions, showed partial or complete strand separations allowing the construction of denaturation maps. By using a modified denaturation procedure, i. e., heating of isolated SV 40 DNA in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide and formaldehyde followed by keeping the DNA in this denaturation solution at room temperature for periods up to 3 weeks, partially denatured relaxed circles without single-strand scissions were produced (form I'D) in addition to completely denatured form II molecules. The absence of single-strand scissions in form I'D molecules was demonstrated by a second heat treatment, which did not change the configuration of this molecular form. Form I'D molecules, in contrast to form I', contained denatured sites clearly discerible under the electron microscope. This combined application of two subsequent denaturation steps (denaturation by heating followed by denaturation at room temperature and neutral pH) showed that the molecular configuration I'D originated in two steps. The heating procedure produced molecules not distinquishable by electron microscopy from form I. In contrast to form I, these molecules were assumed to possess "preformed" denaturation sites (form I). Further treatment of form I molecules with denaturation solution at room temperature finally transformed them into convalently closed, relaxed, partially denatured circles exhibiting strand separations easily measurable on electron micrographs (form I'D). Denaturation maps of form I'D molecules were constructed by computer and compared with denaturation maps derived from partially denatured form II molecules. From these denaturation maps it can be concluded that the melting of base pairs occurring during the transition of simian virus 40 DNA form I into form I'D also preferentially happened at sites rich in the bases adenosine and thymine...|$|E
40|$|Nanostructures {{have gained}} {{increasing}} attention not only for their basic scientific richness, {{but also because they}} promise novelties and potentials that may lead to technological revolution. Carbon nanotubes (CNTâ€™s) are one of the primary focuses of nanotechnology because of their unique physical properties such as huge Young modulus, high tensile strength, thermal and electrical conductivity. However many of their physical properties are extremely sensitive to their atomic structure. In order to optimize utilization of CNTs, their fundamental material properties should be well understood. A single shell of a CNT is composed of a wrapped up sheet of graphite. Depending on the wrapping, single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) may have numerous different chiralities. Owing to SWCNTâ€™s outstanding mechanical and electrical properties, many of their fundamental studies and technological applications require a population of tubes with identical chiralities. Separating SWCNT of different chiralities from each other is, however, a challenging problem. One proposed solution is to construct DNA-SWCNT hybrid and separate SWCNTs by their chiralities and diameter chromatographically. An oligomer of specific sequence of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) has been shown to wrap around a SWCNT of a specific chirality and form ssDNA-SWCNT hybrid. Additionally self assembled DNA-SWCNT hybrids can be used a unique platform to study nucleic acid folding structures and other biophysical properties. In this study, DNA-SWCNT hybrids were produced and sorted according to the chirality of the CNT in a controlled fashion by ion exchange chromatography (IEX). During the chromatography, eluent were collected in a series of fractions whose composition was monitored by HPLC detector. Selected fractions were then subjected to detailed analysis by UV-Vis to prove that the single chirality purification of DNA-SWCNT was successful. For confirmation, Atomic Force Microscopy was conducted on the samples and DNA wrapped SWCNTs with expected diameter and DNA pitch were observed indicating that the spectral signatures recorded in UV-Vis analysis is indeed coming from sorted DNA-SWCNT. In future DNA-SWCNT hybrids will be deposited on an advanced nanofabricated silicon chip containing tiny openings. TEM measurements including DNA <b>supertwist</b> imaging and CNT chirality investigations will be done for direct determination of chiral indices (n,m) of the SWCNTs from their electron diffraction patterns (EDPs) ...|$|E
40|$|Although {{for many}} years liquid {{crystals}} were of purely scientific interest, they have now become ubiquitous in everyday life. The use of the nematic liquid crystal phase in flat panel display applications has been the main factor in this popularity. However, {{with the advent of}} the <b>SuperTwist</b> Nematic (STN) device, the limits to which this phase could be exploited for display applications was perhaps reached. With the discovery by Clark et al. of the Surface Stabilised Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal (SSFLC) configuration, the possibility arose of using chiral smectic liquid crystals to create large area, passively addressed, fast switching, flat panel displays. Unfortunately, the structures that form within smectic liquid crystals, and the dynamics of the switching within these, are still not fully understood. In this thesis we address the former of these, making a detailed the study of the structures that form within tilted smectic liquid crystal devices. We present here the first complete theoretical and experimental study of various different ferroelectric liquid crystal materials, where we employed theoretical models based on a simple set of assumptions to understand the behaviour of a set of increasingly complex experimental systems. We started with the simplest of these, Freely Suspended Smectic Films (FSSFs) and then worked with progressively more realistic systems in the form of homeotropically, and later, homogeneously aligned liquid crystal cells. The equilibrium structures that form get particularly complex in the last case, taking the form of tilted and chevron layering structures. In each of these cases, the predictions of the modelling are compared with our experimental results. Further, we present here the first model of the chevron cusp that seeks to include the effects of biaxiality in the S_C phase. We also present a model that seeks to analyse the stability of the chevron layering structure and its relationship with tilted layers. This includes an analysis of temperature driven transitions between the two structures. We also predicted a pre-transitional splay in the bookshelf structure just above the S_A to S_C phase transition, and attempted to test this experimentally.

40|$|A {{target protein}} for nalidixic and oxolinic acids in Escherichia coli, the nalA gene product (Pnal), was {{purified}} to homogeneity as judged by gel electrophoresis, using an {{in vitro complementation}} assay. It is a dimer of identical 110, 000 -dalton subunits. A polypeptide of this molecular weight is uniquely induced by a Î» nalA transducing phage, thereby showing that the purified Pnal {{is a product of}} the nalA gene. Nalidixic and oxolinic acids inhibit DNA gyrase activity and induce formation of a relaxation complex analogue. Treatment of the complex with sodium dodecyl sulfate causes a doublestrand break in the DNA substrate and the resulting linear molecule seems covalently bound to protein. Complex formation, unlike the introduction of <b>supertwists,</b> does not require ATP or relaxed circular DNA and is insensitive to novobiocin. DNA gyrase from a strain with a nalA mutation conferring drug resistance (nalAr) is 1 / 100 as sensitive to oxolinic and nalidixic acids with respect to inhibition of <b>supertwisting</b> and induction of the pre-linearization complex. Addition of Pnal restores drug sensitivity and stimulates DNA gyrase activity. DNA gyrase preparations and Pnal catalyze a third reaction sensitive to nalidixic and oxolinic acids, the ATP-independent relaxation of supertwister DNA. Relaxation by gyrase from nalAr cells is drug resistant. The nicking-closing activity is distinct from E. coli Ï‰ protein in several properties, including the ability to relax positively <b>supertwisted</b> DNA. We postulate that the nalA gene product occurs in two molecular forms, as Pnal and as a gyrase component.
