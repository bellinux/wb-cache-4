25|$|The port {{was under}} the control of the Haitian {{government}} of Toussaint Louverture, which threw the crew of the privateer into prison. The men from Bordelais spent four months in prison but were well treated, with Gordon and the midshipman being permitted to move freely on parole. Eventually all were released to a cartel under the command of Captain Kelpoisson, the commander of the port of Aux Cayes, and the only Frenchman in a position of authority. The British arrived at Port Royal (except for one man who had died), where they found out that the war was over. They returned to Bordelais, where Gordon was able to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the officers' mess before any of his fellow officers even knew that he had returned.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the meeting}} at the church, the most {{controversial}} incident in Clark's career occurred. Unaware that Clark had retaken Vincennes, a war party of Indians and Canadiens came into town. There was a skirmish, and Clark's men captured six. Two of the prisoners were Canadiens and were released {{at the request of}} the villagers and one of Clark's Canadien followers. Clark decided to make an example of the remaining four Indian prisoners. They were made to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> view of the fort and then tomahawked to death; the bodies were scalped and then thrown into the river. Although Hamilton did not witness the executions, he later wrote that Clark had killed one or more of the Indians with his own hands. Some historians believe that Hamilton exaggerated because, after being imprisoned by the Americans, for war crimes, he had motivation to make his captors seem even worse. Clark did not claim to have been one of the executioners, but he wrote about the killings without apology, believing them to be justifiable revenge for murdered Kentucky settlers and a means to intimidate Indians into stopping their raids.|$|E
500|$|Although the Pittston strike {{involved}} coal miners, many of {{the supporters}} of the strike were not miners at all. A majority of the support that the union members received was from women, who were a pivotal aspect of the strike. Many of these women were either wives or daughters of miners who worked for Pittston, but some women supporters had no affiliation with Pittston Coal Company or mining at all. The women would <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the middle of roads causing blockages while others would drive slowly in front of coal trucks to cause delays. Two famous groups of women supporters arose during this time; [...] "The Daughters of Mother Jones" [...] and [...] "The Freedom Fighters". At {{the peak of the}} strike around 500 women were involved in supporting the miners, most of them housewives.|$|E

500|$|In April 1998, {{three years}} after the game was released, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System came under {{criticism}} for owning 435,000 shares worth $9 million in Cendant, which by this point had purchased Sierra On-Line, due to the violence in the Phantasmagoria and other Sierra games. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, and Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, all asked the system to sell its stock. McConnell was particularly critical of the rape scene. They suggested a link existed between recent student slayings in West Paducah, Kentucky, and Jonesboro, Arkansas, and the [...] "increasingly violent world many American children enter when they <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> front of a computer screen". Pat Miller, executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System, said the system wasn't aware of Phantasmagoria or Sierra's products, and that it invested in Cendant because it's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country. Miller added that, if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On-Line, it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company, and that the system would divest its stock if it refused. Miller said: [...] "We're not going to continue to invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental to our children. We know that our membership would not want us to do that." [...] The same letter was also sent to heads of teachers' retirement systems in California, Ohio and Texas.|$|E
2500|$|Former {{party leader}} and prime {{minister}} James Callaghan said that a ballot was needed to decide when to end the strike and return to work.

2500|$|After his release, Paige {{played for}} several Mobile semi-pro teams. He joined the semi-pro Mobile Tigers where his brother Wilson was already pitching. He also pitched for a semi-pro team named the Down the Bay Boys, and he {{recalled}} that he once got into a jam {{in the ninth inning}} of a 1–0 ballgame when his teammates made three consecutive errors, loading the bases for the other team with two outs. Angry, Paige said he stomped around the mound, kicking up dirt. The fans started booing him, so he decided that [...] "somebody {{was going to have to}} be showed up for that." [...] He called in his outfielders and had them <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the infield. With the fans and his own teammates howling, Paige struck out the final batter, winning the game.|$|E

I was standing in ice cold water {{up to the top}} of my boots all the time, and rowing continuously for nearly five hours. We took off about fifteen more people who were standing on a capsized boat. In all, our boat had by that time sixty-five or sixty-six people. There was no room to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> our boat, so we all stood, except some sitting along the side.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} to the House of Commons (17 December), he slipped into the Chamber largely {{unacknowledged}} by his own party. One Conservative MP rose to wave his Order Paper, only to have to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> embarrassment whilst Labour MPs laughed. On 18 December he addressed the 1922 committee (Conservative backbenchers), declaring “as long as I live, I shall never apologise for what we did”, but was unable to answer a question about the validity of the Tripartite Declaration of 1950 (which he had in fact reaffirmed in April 1955, two days before becoming Prime Minister). In his final statement to the House of Commons as Prime Minister (20 December 1956) he performed well in a difficult debate, but told MPs that [...] "there was not foreknowledge that Israel would attack Egypt". Victor Rothwell writes that the knowledge of his having misled the House of Commons on this way must have hung over him thereafter, as was the concern that the US Administration might demand that Britain pay reparations to Egypt. Papers released in January 1987 showed the entire Cabinet had been informed of the plan on 23 October 1956.|$|E

[...] Oliva also said that Savatage has [...] "already gotten offers" [...] to play in [...] "certain areas of the world, America being one, Greece, South America, places like that", and added that he does not rule out the possibility of any more shows. Though Oliva said he does not know what the future holds for Savatage, he said, [...] "I just wish that everything works out good and then we'll see what happens down the road. I'll never say no to anything anymore, because every time I do, I get rained on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{obviously}} {{the foundation and}} progeny curse {{was not the only}} religious invocation by the political powers during the Akkadian empire, it demonstrates a certain standardization, and with it, stagnation, of the position of the gods that likely did not sit well with the people of Lagaš. Ur-Ningirsu I, with whom the Gudean dynasty of Lagaš begins, leaves {{little in the way of}} inscriptions, and though some mention of various gods seems to indicate a more central role, it is not until Gudea that there can be a side-by-side comparison with the old curse of Sargon. The inscription on a statue of Gudea as architect of the House of Ningirsu, warns the reader of doom if the words are altered, but there is a startling difference between the warnings of Sargon or his line and the warnings of Gudea. The one is length; Gudea’s curse lasts nearly a quarter of the inscription’s considerable length, and another is creativity. The gods will not merely reduce the offender’s progeny to ash and destroy his foundations, no, they will, [...] "let him <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the dust instead of on the seat they set up for him". He will be [...] "slaughtered like a bull… seized like an aurochs by his fierce horn".|$|E
2500|$|Arne De Boever {{believes}} {{that there is a}} [...] "close affinity, and intimacy even, between the sheriff and Chigurh in No Country for Old Men [...] in a number of scenes. There is, to begin with, the sheriff's voice {{at the beginning of the}} film, which accompanies the images of Chigurh's arrest. This initial weaving together of the figures of Chigurh and the sheriff is further developed later on in the film, when the sheriff visits Llewelyn Moss' trailer home in search for Moss and his wife, Carla Jean. Chigurh has visited the trailer only minutes before, and the Coen brothers have the sheriff <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the same exact spot where Chigurh had been sitting (which is almost the exact same spot where, the evening before, Moss joined his wife on the couch). Like Chigurh, the sheriff sees himself reflected in the dark glass of Moss' television, their mirror images perfectly overlapping if one were to superimpose these two shots. When the sheriff pours himself a glass of milk from the bottle that stands sweating on the living room table—a sign that the sheriff and his colleague, deputy Wendell (Garret Dillahunt), only just missed their man—this mirroring of images goes beyond the level of reflection, and Chigurh enters into the sheriff's constitution, thus further undermining any easy opposition of Chigurh and the sheriff, and instead exposing a certain affinity, intimacy, or similarity even between both." ...|$|E

2500|$|Described by Gomez as [...] "a {{beautiful}} {{start to}} the album", [...] "Good for You" [...] was the third song she received since signing with her new label Interscope Records, as well the second track to be recorded for the album. It was uninterruptedly recorded in 45 minutes at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California; during the process, Gomez's vocals featured cracks as the song [...] "took on this emotion [...] didn't realize [...] could tap into", and {{at the beginning of}} the session she was exhausted from pressurizing herself for a sound and concept for the album. According to her, this recording had no beat and was [...] "just a skeleton of a song". There was also no specific sound planned for the song at the time although it was suggested that its soft melodies be made more pop-indebted which Gomez disagreed with, believing it would take away from her vocal. She was entirely involved in the song's creative direction, providing additional songwriting, and helped to develop it to represent her process of self-realization, her confidence as a young woman, and feelings of vulnerability. The song also formed part of a process in which she wanted to portray her story as an artist and as part of a transitional album over which she would take full control. In an interview for MTV, she said this was her time [...] "to embrace who I am, and I'm not going to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a chair and talk about something that doesn't mean anything to me anymore" [...] and spoke about her involvement in the track: [...] "This is the most I've been creatively involved from the writing process ... every single thing I'm even remotely singing about is something I've related to and something I'm hitting the nail on, and I had to pick what was going to represent the album and who I am as a whole".|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the close}} of {{probation}} will be a [...] "time of trouble", which will be a period of intense conflict and persecution for God's people (Revelation 13:15-17; 7:14). Shortly afterward, Christ will return in glory (1 Thessalonians 4:15-17; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10) and raise the righteous dead (the [...] "first resurrection", Revelation 20:4-5), whom he will take to heaven together with the righteous living to share his millennial reign (Revelation 20:6). Just who these [...] "righteous" [...] are will, of course, have been revealed {{during the course of}} the Investigative Judgment. [...] During the millennium, Satan will be imprisoned on earth alone with his demons (Revelation 20:1-3). [...] During this period God's redeemed will be in heaven, having 1000 years to examine the books of Judgment for themselves, ensuring that God has acted fairly in His dealings with humanity. [...] Judgment is committed to those who have walked in human shoes to ensure that the lost have indeed rejected God (Revelation 20:4). [...] At the end of the millennium, Christ will again return to earth with His redeemed to raise the wicked (the [...] "second resurrection", Revelation 20:5). [...] Satan will then deceive the wicked into attacking God's people (Revelation 20:7-9). [...] At this time, Christ will <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> final Executive Judgment and the books will be open for all (sinner and saved alike) to see and judge (Revelation 20:11-13).

[...] Having already thrown Satan and his demonic henchmen into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:10), God now consigns those who have rejected forgiveness to incineration and eternal death (Revelation 20:15). [...] Those who have accepted forgiveness inherit a recreated, perfect, new earth. (Revelation 21:1-5). [...] Adventists feel that their eschatological message is to sound the cry of Revelation 22:17: [...] "The Spirit and the bride say, 'Come.' [...] And let him who hears say, 'Come.'
