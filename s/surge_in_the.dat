40|$|We examine {{episodes of}} large gross FDI inflows – surges – at the sectoral level between 1994 and 2009 for 95 emerging-market and {{industrial}} countries.

Turning to the determinants of surges, we find that global and contagion factors have a stronger effect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> services than <b>the</b> manufacturing sector; <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> financial sector FDI are particularly contagious in emerging market countries. With regard to domestic factors, we find that (i) high public debt reduces the likelihood of experiencing FDI <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manufacturing and trade/transport sector, that (ii) high growth pulls <b>in</b> FDI <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manufacturing sector and that (iii) privatization is strongly associated with FDI <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manufacturing and financial sector. Finally, we document a role for capital controls: they tend to increase the likelihood of FDI <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manufacturing, other services, and financial sector. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Being {{bordered by}} the South China Sea and with long coastline, the coastal zone of Guangdong Province is often under severe risk of storm surges, {{as one of}} a few re-gions in China which is seriously {{threatened}} by storm surges. This article systematically analyzes the vulnerability factors of storm <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coastal area of Guangdong (from Yangjing to Shanwei).

5|$|A {{few hours}} {{prior to its}} development, outer rainbands from the {{depression}} began moving over portions of the Texas coast.

Sustained winds peaked at 69mph (112km/h) with gusts to 85mph (137km/h) at Sea Rim State Park; the National Weather Service estimates gusts exceeded 90mph (145km/h) in southwestern Jefferson County and extreme southeastern Chambers County. In the Golden Pass Ship Channel, an unofficial report of a 115mph (185km/h) wind gust was relayed to the National Hurricane Center.

5|$|Cyclone Bella was a {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that passed near the Mauritius outer island of Rodrigues. The second named storm of the season, Bella {{originated in the}} middle of January 1991 from a <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> monsoon trough to the southwest of Sumatra. For several days, the system remained weak as it moved generally west-southwestward. On January25, it intensified to tropical storm status, but Bella took three more days to intensify to tropical cyclone status, with 10minute maximum sustained winds of 120kilometres per hour (75miles per hour). The cyclone attained peak intensity on January29, officially reaching winds of 155km/h (100mph). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center unofficially estimated winds of 240km/h (150mph), the highest the agency estimated for any storm in the Southern Hemisphere in the year. Bella later turned to the southeast and weakened, passing about 50km (30mi) west of Rodrigues on January31. The storm turned to the south-southwest and back to the southeast again, becoming extratropical on February4.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1996, a <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{trade winds}} interacted with the monsoon trough {{to produce an}} area of convection.

Despite strong wind shear, the system slowly became better organized as it moved southward, aided by improving upper-level outflow. Early on 5April, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 25S as the system began a westward track, steered by a building mid-level ridge to the south. Shortly thereafter, the BoM upgraded the system to a Category1 cyclone, designating the storm as Tropical Cyclone Olivia.|$|E

In Florida, damage was relatively severe, and included the deaths of several people. High winds brought down trees and power lines, and wind-driven salt water damaged vegetation well inland across Dade County, though the storm was characterized by unusually light rainfall. Storm <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Everglades region flooded local streets, particularly at Everglades City.
