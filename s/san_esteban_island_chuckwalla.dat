50|$|The <b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> {{chuckwalla}} (Sauromalus varius), {{also known}} as the piebald chuckwalla or pinto chuckwalla, is a species of chuckwalla belonging to the family Iguanidae endemic to <b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> <b>Island</b> in the Gulf of California. It is the largest of the five species of chuckwallas and the most endangered.|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} of mainland and insular populations {{of this species}} has been valuable in providing biologists with study and control groups comparing the evolution of island populations and their mainland counterparts. The <b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> <b>Island</b> subspecies (C.h. conspicuosa) coexists with the giant <b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> chuckwalla, contrary to predictions of ecological niche theory.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> {{chuckwalla}} is {{endemic to}} <b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> <b>Island</b> in the Gulf of California. [...] While it is abundant on this small island, it occurs naturally nowhere else and {{is protected under}} the Endangered Species Act. At one time, the Seri translocated populations of this lizard to other islands in the Sea of Cortés as a food item, {{but none of these}} populations has survived beyond the original population found on <b>San</b> <b>Esteban.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Chuckwallas are stocky, wide-bodied lizards with {{flattened}} midsections {{and prominent}} bellies. Their tails are thick, tapering to a blunt tip. [...] Loose folds of skin characterize {{the neck and}} sides of their bodies, which are covered in small, coarsely granular scales. The common chuckwalla (Sauromalus ater) measures 15 3/4 inches long, whereas insular species such as the <b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> <b>chuckwalla</b> of <b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> <b>Island</b> (Sauromalus varius) can measure as long as 30 in.|$|R
5000|$|<b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> <b>Island</b> (Isla <b>San</b> <b>Esteban,</b> Seri: Coftéecöl [...] and {{sometimes}} Hast [...] ) {{is a small}} island in the Gulf of California, Mexico, located to the southwest of Tiburón Island. It {{is part of the}} Municipality of Hermosillo in Sonora, and has a land area of 39.773 km² (15.356 sq mi), the 15th-largest island in Mexico. It is located in the Gulf of California. It was once inhabited by a group of the Seri people.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{believed}} that these iguanas may have {{ended up on the}} Baja peninsula and the islands because early Seri Indian inhabitants transported them there from the mainland as food sources thousands of years ago. [...] This theory is {{based on the fact that}} the coastal distribution on the mainland ends 115 km south of Isla <b>San</b> <b>Esteban.</b> [...] Contrary to predictions from ecological niche theory, the species coexists with the giant <b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> <b>chuckwalla</b> on <b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> <b>Island.</b> [...] The two species forage for the same plants in the same habitat at the same time of day during the same season, with neither species displacing the other.|$|R
50|$|The Seris are an {{indigenous}} {{group of the}} Mexican state of Sonora. The majority reside on the Seri communal property (Spanish, ejido), in the towns of Punta Chueca (Seri Socaaix or Socaaix hac) and El Desemboque (Seri Haxöl Iihom) on the mainland coast of the Gulf of California. Tiburón Island (Tahejöc, Tahejöc himquij or Tahejöc quij) and <b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> <b>Island</b> (Cofteecöl, Cofteecöl hipcap and sometimes Hast) were part of their traditional territory, but some Seris also lived in various places on the mainland. They were historically seminomadic hunter-gatherers who maintained an intimate relationship with both {{the sea and the}} land. It is one of the ethnic groups of Mexico that has most strongly maintained its language and culture during the years after contact with Spanish and Mexican cultures.|$|R
2500|$|It {{is found}} in the southwestern United States in Arizona, New Mexico and west and central Texas, and Mexico as far south as Oaxaca. Also it {{is found in}} the Gulf of California on <b>San</b> <b>Estéban</b> and Tiburón <b>Islands.</b> The {{distribution}} reaches a maximum elevation of 2930 m. Although it has been recorded being seen at as high of an altitude as 6900 feet at the McDonald Observatory in the Davis Mountains of West Texas. The type locality given is [...] "Fort Webster, St. Rita del Cobre, N. Mex." [...] (Fort Webster, Santa Rita del Cobre, Grant County, New Mexico, USA).|$|R
50|$|The Comca’ac {{considered}} this species of chuckwalla an important food item. So much so, a few lizards were cross-bred with <b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> chuckwallas and translocated {{to most of}} the islands in Bahia de los Angeles: Isla San Lorenzo Norte, Isla San Lorenzo Sur, and Tiburón Island by the Seri people for use as a food source in times of need. This was before the founding of America and most of these populations appear to have died out, but the process was repeated by herpeticulturalists in the early 2000s as a way of legally producing a San Esteban-like chuckwalla that the average reptile enthusiast could keep. The crosses are fertile and seem to have the best traits of both species - the brighter coloration of the <b>San</b> <b>Esteban</b> chuckwalla with the calmer temperament of the Angel <b>Island</b> <b>chuckwalla.</b>|$|R
