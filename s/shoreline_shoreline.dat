40|$|In this dissertation, four {{positional}} quality {{measures for}} linear features presented by Ramirez (2000) were thoroughly investigated on shoreline features including Generalization Factor, Distortion Factor, Bias Factor, and Fuzziness Factor. The investigation addresses the uniquness {{of each one}} of the four measures and the effect of random errors, systematic errors and blunders in the shoreline on the four measures. The results show that these four measures describe different characteristics of a shoreline. Also a new shoreline change modeling method was developed in this study based on a new concept known as shoreline-segment orientation. This method helps to better analyze shoreline-change at the segment level by studying the angular deviation from the surrounding segments and also from the whole <b>shoreline.</b> <b>Shoreline</b> segment orientation is critical in shoreline erosion analysis because it considers the direction of the incoming waves towards the shoreline. The results of analyzing shoreline change in the study area based on this concept of segmen...|$|E
40|$|Shoreline profile has a {{tendency}} to adjust the wave effect on the shoreline. Changes to the line consists of two kinds of erosion and sedimentation. Waves that can affect shorlines rise due to the influence of the wind, the wind blowing duration and distance without hurdles when the wind blows (fetch). The waves were coming to cause the migration of sediment on the shoreline. If waves erode sediment on the <b>shoreline,</b> <b>shoreline</b> will occur erosion and if the waves bring sedi- ment to the shoreline, on the shoreline sedimentation will occur. For example there is the Kelapa Rapat Beach (Pesawaran). On the beach, there is a highway a short distance away from the shoreline. Potential erosion will occur at the shoreline can cause breakdown of the resulting ero- sion of sediment on the shoreline. Due to the potential, then do research using GENESIS program to be able to estimate the extent of erosion potential disruption accessibility having an effect way contained in about Kelapa Rapat Beach.

40|$|We {{measured}} shoreline reconfiguration and {{variability in}} shoreline retreat in Flathead Lake, {{which is a}} large glacial lake regulated by a hydroelectric dam at its natural outlet. Wave-induced erosion rates ranged from 0. 5 to 2. 5 m yr-I at the northshore study site where fetch, and hence wave energy, was maximal. Shoreline retreat was not solely related to storm intensity or volumetric changes in nearshore bars. Three erosive processes {{were involved in the}} measured variability of shoreline retreat: undercutting, endstripping, and ovcrwash. Wave scour on an exposed bank caused undercutting and endstripping, while overwash resulted when water was forced {{over the top of the}} <b>shoreline.</b> <b>Shoreline</b> morphology and vegetation determined the type of erosion process and the rate of shoreline retreat. Shoreline retreat was offset by localized and dramatic accretion caused by sediment entrapment by drift logs bordering the shoreline. The eroding shoreline and ncarshore bed were sediment sources for the accretion. Drift logs naturally protcctcd the shoreline from direct wave attack and stimulated sediment accretion, providing new rccruitmcnt arca for riparian vegetation.

40|$|Two {{regional}} {{studies conducted}} during dry weather {{demonstrated that the}} Southern California Bight (SCB) shoreline has good water quality, except near areas that drain land-based runoff. Here, we repeat those regional studies 36 h after a rainstorm to assess the influence of runoff under high flow conditions. Two hundred and fifty-four shoreline sites between Santa Barbara, California and Ensenada, Mexico were sampled using a stratified-random sampling design with four strata: sandy beaches, rocky <b>shoreline,</b> <b>shoreline</b> adjacent to urban runoff outlets that flow intermittently, and shoreline adjacent to outlets that flow year-round. Each site was sampled for total coliforms, fecal coliforms (or E. coli), and enterococci. Sixty percent of the shoreline failed water quality standards after the storm compared to only 6 % during dry weather. Failure of water quality standards increased to more than 90 % for shoreline areas adjacent to urban runoff outlets.

Beaches comprised 50. 8 %, marshes 44. 9 %, and other shoreline types 4. 3 % of the oiled <b>shoreline.</b> <b>Shoreline</b> cleanup activities were authorized on 660 km, or 73. 3 % of oiled beaches and up to 71 km, or 8. 9 % of oiled marshes and associated habitats. One year after the spill began, oil remained on 847 km; two years later, oil remained on 687 km, though at much lesser degrees of oiling. For example, shorelines characterized as heavily oiled went from a maximum of 360 km, to 22. 4 km one year later, and to 6. 4 km two years later.

40|$|A {{series of}} coastal zone hazard maps cover the area {{impacted}} by Hurricane Hugo (1989) in eastern Puerto Rico. The mapping {{strategy was to}} develop a tool for quick visualization of multiple hazards for use by coastal planners, managers, property owners, and potential property owners. The Puerto Rico shoreline is heavily developed in places and also highly compartmentalized in terms of shoreline types, geology, and adjacent shelf condi-tions. Hazards such as coastal erosion, storm surge, riverine flooding, landsliding, and seismic impact also may be compart-mentalized. From a management perspective, resources there-fore can be allocated on a compartment-by-compartment basis. Six types of hazards were considered in this investigation: (1) shoreline-setting hazards (long-term coastal problems), (2) ma-rine hazards (short-term impacts of coastal storms), (3) earth-quake and slope hazards (ground shaking, landslides, and lique-faction), (4) riverine hazards (historical floods), (5) development hazards (high-density development at risk or low-density development in extreme-hazard settings), and (6) engi-neering hazards (special cases in which shoreline engineering projects such as breakwaters or sand mining have significant detrimental effects on portions of the <b>shoreline).</b> <b>Shoreline</b> seg-ments were ranked as being at extreme, high, moderate, or low risk, depending on the number of hazards present within that segment. These rankings are likely to change, gradually over de-cades with natural coastal evolution, more rapidly as human de-velopment infringes on the coastal zone, or in an instant during a severe storm. The hazard maps provide a basis for hazard miti-gation and management recommendations...|$|E

40|$|Mateusz Strzelecki High Arctic Paraglacial Coastal Evolution in Northern Billefjorden, Svalbard In {{contrast}} to mid and low latitude coasts, relatively {{little is known}} regarding the potential impacts of climate and sea-level change on cold region coastal margins. This is an important area of research given the pace of recent climate change and future predictions. Svalbard provided a superb location to quantify how High Arctic coasts are responding to climate warming and the associated paraglacial landscape transformation. The geographical focus for the thesis is Petuniabukta and Adolfbukta, the northernmost bays of Billefjorden, central Spitsbergen. The study area has a sheltered location, a semi-arid, sub-polar climate, limited wave fetch and tidal range, and rapid retreat rate of all surrounding glaciers. Using a combination of geomorphological, sedimentological, remote sensing and dating methods, the thesis investigates the processes that control coastal evolution over annual, century and millennial timescales. Interannual changes observed between 2008 and 2010 show that High Arctic gravel-barriers are resilient {{to the impact of}} local storms and the operation of sea-ice processes. The results of a Schmidt Hammer test demonstrate a significant reduction in rock resistance with decreasing distance from the modern <b>shoreline.</b> <b>Shoreline</b> changes {{since the end of the}} Little Ice Age (late 19 th/early 20 th century) reflect a dramatic increase in sediment supply associated with retreating local ice masses, a shortened winter sea-ice season and melting of permafrost. A new approach of dating of juvenile marine molluscs found in uplifted raised beaches enables the development of a new model of relative sea-level change in the study area. The thesis demonstrates that existing models of paraglacial coastal evolution, developed on mainly temperate latitude coasts, are not applicable to the High Arctic. Whilst the fundamental importance of the sediment supply and relative sea-level is noted, in the High Arctic these processes are modified by climate-driven factors that influence sediment delivery from terrestrial sources, the extent of sea-ice, permafrost as well as river discharge and slope stability. A new model of paraglacial coastal evolution is proposed that captures these processes and recognises the importance of bedrock topography as a key control on landforms preservation. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{intended to}} study the capacity to integrate the potentials of lakes with urban development special reference to the KMC. It focused to envisage that with urban development can be promoted, by integrating potentials of urban lakes. Urban lakes and urban development has integrated with the fields of watershed management; water based urban development, economic, social and environmental value of urban lakes and urban ecology etc. Lake Watershed characteristics such as climatic, physiographic, geology, soil, atershed hydrology, land use and socio economic features are considered {{for the development of}} lake watershed area. Out of those it is necessary to consider the land use and socio economic characters because of which changes by the human intervention. Lakes are influenced to change its natural state by the use and existing development activities surrounding the lake and its watershed area. The vulnerability of those influences varies from lake to lake depending on its size shape, type and related other factors. The level of growth and developments of watersheds of a lake depends on a lake's capacity to support that development. In concerning the sensitivity to development of a lake it needs to consider physical characteristics of lakes as mentioned above and chemical or biological characteristics. However, due to changing overtime of chemical or biological characteristics of lakes it mainly focuses to the physical characteristics for the lake's sensitivity. Based on the lake watershed characteristics, carrying capacity and sensitivity to development, lakes are associated with the significant social, natural and physical features that enhance the lakes characteristics and its surrounding area, and make it a desirable place for people to live, visit and earn a sustainable livelihood. Urban lakes are valuable assets to the people in terms of recreation, tourism, commercial historic sporting visual/landscape amenity, flood management, climatic modification, ecological/environmental etc. A ring of development is generally formed around urban lakes with the greatest density of development activities. In changing natural state of a lake due to development activities it leads to change its carrying capacity. For sustainable development of lakes there are some zoning areas such as lake <b>shoreline,</b> <b>shoreline</b> buffer, shore land protection area and contributing to the watershed area. Also lake water surface area is zoned as inlet, intermediate and outlet areas. For the development of those areas there are some development guidelines to adopt for each lake zones to integrate the lakes potentials for the development. The historic Sri Lanka has utilized their lakes especially for supply of drinking water, recreation, scenic beauty, storm water retention, climatic modification etc. Anuradapura, Pollonnaruwa, Kandy, Yapahuwa, Kurunegala, such all ancient cities had a water body within the city limit for those purposes.

40|$|Abstract In coastal environments, the supratidal zone bridges {{marine and}} {{terrestrial}} ecosystems and {{is important for}} energy exchange. However, it is also subject to extensive anthropogenic disturbance, such as armoring of <b>shorelines.</b> <b>Shoreline</b> armoring is extensive along many coasts, but the impacts on biota are comparatively unknown. Between 2000 and 2002, paired and synoptic sampling regimes were employed to assess armoring effects on insects and benthic macroinvertebrates in the supratidal zone of Puget Sound beaches. Paired sampling showed natural beach sites had significantly more deposited wrack. Infauna was dominated by oligochaetes and nematodes; talitrid amphipods, insects, and collembolans were significantly more numerous at natural beaches, and crustaceans were more abundant at altered beaches. Insect assemblages were diverse, with taxon richness higher at natural beach sites. In the synoptic sampling, where sites with higher elevation modifications were used, there were fewer differences in invertebrate assemblages between armored and nonarmored sites.
