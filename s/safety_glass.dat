5|$|The {{son of a}} clergyman who {{was also}} a politician, Horne had a burgeoning {{business}} career with Triplex <b>Safety</b> <b>Glass,</b> which was interrupted by service with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. While serving in a barrage balloon unit, he was asked to broadcast as a quizmaster on the BBC radio show Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer. The experience brought him into contact with the more established entertainer Richard Murdoch, and the two wrote and starred in the comedy series Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. After demobilisation Horne returned to his business career, and kept his broadcasting as a sideline. His career in industry flourished, and he later became the chairman and managing director of toy manufacturers Chad Valley.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>glasses</b> {{are worn}} {{to protect the}} eyes in {{different}} situations. [...] They are made with break-proof plastic lenses to protect the eye from flying debris or other matter. Construction workers, factory workers, machinists and lab technicians are often required to wear <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> to shield the eyes from flying debris or hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. As of 2017, dentists and surgeons in Canada and other countries are required to wear <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> to protect against infection from patients' blood or other body fluids. There are also <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> for welding, which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full sized welding helmet is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called [...] "flash goggles", because they provide protection from welding flash. Nylon frames are usually used for protection eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties. Unlike most regular <b>glasses,</b> <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> often include protection beside the eyes {{as well as in}} front of the eyes.|$|R

25|$|A <b>safety</b> <b>glass</b> {{mirror is}} made by {{adhering}} a special protective film to the back surface of a silver glass mirror, which prevents injuries in case the mirror is broken. This kind of mirror is used for furniture, doors, glass walls, commercial shelves, or public areas.|$|E
25|$|Progressive {{development}} of the Minicar and Minicar Deluxe continued until the more significant introduction of coil sprung independent rear suspension and the much-needed Triplex <b>Safety</b> <b>glass</b> windscreen. (The Triplex windscreen was subsequently offered by Sharp's Commercials as a retro-fit kit for the earlier Minicar.) This provided an ideal opportunity to relaunch the car as the Bond Minicar (Mark B) in July 1951.|$|E

25|$|Between 1903 and 1908, Ford {{produced}} the Models A, B, C, F, K, N, R, and S. Hundreds {{or a few}} thousand of most of these were sold per year. In 1908, Ford introduced the mass-produced Model T, which totalled millions sold over nearly 20 years. In 1927, Ford replaced the T with the Model A, the first car with <b>safety</b> <b>glass</b> in the windshield. Ford launched the first low-priced car with a V8 engine in 1932.|$|E
500|$|There are no {{conventional}} security devices, such as barbed tape, electric fences, towers, or snipers. However, {{there is}} <b>safety</b> <b>glass,</b> a 6meter [...] 1.5kilometer (6.5ft [...] 1mi) concrete and steel wall, {{and a system}} of underground tunnels which guards use {{to walk through the}} prison. Although there are surveillance cameras on the prison grounds, they are not present in the cells, the cell hallways, the common rooms, the classrooms, and most of the workshops. While there is little violence reported, almost exclusively in Unit A, officers try to prevent it. If two inmates have a dispute, they engage in a mediation session under staff supervision. If mediation fails, repeated misbehavior or rule violations are punished with cell confinement or prison transference.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Littleton {{also began}} experimenting with vitreography (printmaking using glass plates). [...] He {{received}} a research {{grant from the}} University in 1975 to continue this work, and his first prints from this process were shown in a show at the Madison Art Center. [...] When he left Wisconsin in 1977 and established his own studio in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, he designated one room in the studio for printmaking. [...] By 1981, he had hired a part-time printmaker, and in 1983 he built a separate facility for the presses. [...] He regularly invited artists in various media to explore the possibilities. [...] Littleton’s own prints were often simple geometric shapes, and sometimes made from shotgun-shattered <b>safety</b> <b>glass.</b> [...] When back problems forced him to [...] stop working in hot glass in 1990, Littleton continued his printmaking.|$|E

500|$|Austin Pilkington was aggrieved at Horne's {{failure to}} make the most of the {{opportunity}} he had provided, and decided against offering the young man a post in the family firm. Despite the disappointment, through his contacts within the industry, he secured for the young Horne an interview with the Triplex <b>Safety</b> <b>Glass</b> Company at King's Norton, a district of Birmingham. Horne's sporting record commended him to the manager of the Triplex factory, and he was taken on as a management trainee on a modest salary. In September 1930, despite his unimpressive finances, he married Lady Mary Pelham-Clinton-Hope, daughter of the 8th Duke of Newcastle. The marriage was happy at first, but had broken down by 1932. Mary applied for an annulment in November 1932; she declared the reason was [...] "the incapacity of the respondent [...] to consummate the marriage", which was dissolved in 1933, although the two remained on friendly terms thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Category5 is {{the highest}} {{category}} of the Saffir–Simpson scale. These storms cause complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings, and some complete building failures with small utility buildings blown over or away. Collapse of many wide-span roofs and walls, especially those with no interior supports, is common. Very heavy and irreparable damage to many wood frame structures and total destruction to mobile/manufactured homes is prevalent. Only a few types of structures are capable of surviving intact, and only if located at least [...] inland. They include office, condominium and apartment buildings and hotels that are of solid concrete or steel frame construction, public multi-story concrete parking garages, and residences that are made of either reinforced brick or concrete/cement block and have hipped roofs with slopes of no less than 35degrees from horizontal and no overhangs of any kind, and if the windows are either made of hurricane-resistant <b>safety</b> <b>glass</b> or covered with shutters. Unless all of these requirements are met, the absolute destruction of a structure is certain.|$|E
500|$|For the Borg battle, Knoll {{insisted on}} closeup shots that were near the alien vessel, necessitating a {{physical}} model. ILM layered their [...] model {{with an additional}} fiveinches of etched brass over a glowing neon lightbox for internal illumination. To make the Borg vessel appear even larger than it was, Knoll made sure that an edge of it was facing the camera like the prow of a ship and that the Cube broke {{the edges of the}} frame. To give the Cube greater depth and texture, Rosenberg shot the vessel with harsher light. [...] "I created this really odd, raking three-quarter backlight coming from the right or left side, which I balanced out with nets and a couple of little lights. I wanted it to look scary and mysterious, so it was lit like a point, and we always had the camera dutched to it; we never just had it coming straight at us," [...] he said. Small lights attached to the Cube's surface helped to create visual interest and convey scale; the model was deliberately shot with a slow, determined pacing to contrast with the Federation ships engaged in battle with the Borg. The impact of Federation weaponry on the Borg Cube was simulated using a [...] model of the Cube. The model had specific areas which could be blown up multiple times without damaging the miniature. For the final explosion of the Cube, Rosenberg shot ten [...] Cube miniatures with explosive-packed lightweight skins. The Cubes were suspended from pipes sixtyfeet above the camera on the ground. <b>Safety</b> <b>glass</b> was placed over the lens to prevent damage, while the camera was covered with plywood to protect it from bits of plastic that rained down after each explosion. The smaller Borg sphere was a [...] model that was shot separately from the Cube and digitally added in post-production. The time-travel vortex the Sphere creates was simulated with a rocket re-entry effect; bowshock forms in front of the ship, then streams backwards at high speed. Interactive lighting was played across the computer-generated Enterprise model for when the ship is caught in the time vortex.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{acrylic acid}} {{was created in}} 1843. Methacrylic acid, derived from acrylic acid, was {{formulated}} in 1865. The reaction between methacrylic acid and methanol results in the ester methyl methacrylate. Polymethyl methacrylate was discovered in the early 1930s by British chemists Rowland Hill and John Crawford at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in England. ICI registered the product under the trademark Perspex. About the same time, chemist and industrialist Otto Röhm of Rohm and Haas AG in Germany attempted to produce <b>safety</b> <b>glass</b> by polymerizing methyl methacrylate between two layers of glass. The polymer separated from the glass as a clear plastic sheet, which Röhm gave the trademarked name Plexiglas in 1933. Both Perspex and Plexiglas were commercialized in the late 1930s. In the United States, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (now DuPont Company) subsequently introduced its own product under the trademark Lucite. In 1936 Imperial Chemical Industries (now Lucite International) began the first commercially viable production of acrylic <b>safety</b> <b>glass.</b> During World War II both Allied and Axis forces used acrylic glass for submarine periscopes and aircraft windshields, canopies, and gun turrets. [...] Airplane pilots whose eyes were damaged by flying shards of PMMA fared much better than those injured by standard glass, demonstrating better compatibility between human tissue and PMMA than glass. Civilian applications followed after the war.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1949, a Deluxe {{version was}} added to the range. This has a Villiers 6E [...] engine, which had an {{increased}} output to [...] and a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton. [...] There were also a number of modest refinements including a spare wheel and a single wing mirror. The manually operated windscreen wiper fitted on the standard car was upgraded to an electric Lucas type. Although this was found to damage the original perspex windscreen, it was not replaced by a Triplex <b>Safety</b> <b>Glass</b> screen until the introduction of the Mark B in 1951.|$|E
2500|$|The Kari-Keen Coupe and the Swanson Coupe {{featured}} the characteristic Swanson cantilever wing design. The Swanson planes also shared a similar seating configuration; the two-passengers were seated beside each other. Model W-15 featured detachable passenger-side controls {{which could be}} mounted or removed depending on whether a student pilot was present. This design feature made the plane suitable for use in flight schools. The cabin windshield was made using <b>safety</b> <b>glass</b> and the door window panes were retractable. The plane had two variants: Standard and Deluxe. Both variants had dual flight controls, low pressure tires and mohair interior. Both models featured dual engine throttle controls: the main throttle control and a secondary throttle control button installed on the brake lever. The Deluxe came with an electric starter and more elaborate instrumentation. The prices were $4,450 for the Standard model and [...] $4,985 for the Deluxe.|$|E
