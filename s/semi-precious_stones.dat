The marble shades of the pavilion are capped with merlons to hide view from the grounds.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar's natural {{resources}} include {{a variety of}} unprocessed agricultural and mineral resources. Agriculture (including raffia), fishing and forestry are mainstays of the economy. Madagascar is the world's principal supplier of vanilla, cloves and ylang-ylang. Other key agricultural resources include coffee, lychees and shrimp. Key mineral resources include various types of precious and <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stones,</b> and Madagascar currently provides half of the world's supply of sapphires, which were discovered near Ilakaka in the late 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Insular art is {{the name}} given to the common style that {{developed}} in Britain and Ireland from the eighth century and which became highly influential in continental Europe {{and contributed to the}} development of Romanesque and Gothic styles. It can be seen in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stones,</b> in the heavily carved high crosses found particularly in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, which may have been begun, or wholly created at the monastic centre of Iona.|$|E
5|$|Insular art is {{the name}} given to the common style that {{developed}} in Britain and Ireland after {{the conversion of the}} Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles, and which became highly influential in continental Europe, contributing to the development of Romanesque and Gothic styles. It can be seen in elaborate penannular brooches, often making extensive use of <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stones,</b> in the heavily carved high crosses found most frequently in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, which may have been begun, or wholly created on Iona, the key location in Scotland for insular art. The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life by Viking raids in the late eighth century. Later elaborate metal work has survived in buried hoards such as the St Ninian's Isle Treasure and several finds from the Viking period.|$|E
5|$|Kodumanal {{was popular}} for the {{gem-cutting}} industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stones</b> such as beryls, sapphire and quartz {{are located in}} the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.|$|E

5|$|Land {{ownership}} was important. Most of {{the growers}} were tenant farmers and {{were given the}} right of part ownership of the land over time. Tax policies encouraging needed produce made distinctions between land use to determine tax levies. For example, the daily market availability of rose petals was important for perfumers, so cultivation of roses received a lower tax assessment. Salt production and the manufacture of salt pans were controlled by similar means. The making of ghee (clarified butter), which was sold as an oil for human consumption and as a fuel for lighting lamps, was profitable. Exports to China intensified and included cotton, spices, jewels, <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stones,</b> ivory, rhino horn, ebony, amber, coral, and aromatic products such as perfumes. Large vessels from China made frequent visits, some captained by the Chinese Admiral Zheng He, and brought Chinese products to the empire's 300 ports, large and small, on the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The ports of Mangalore, Honavar, Bhatkal, Barkur, Cochin, Cannanore, Machilipatnam, and Dharmadam were the most important.|$|E
5|$|The Celts practiced {{advanced}} {{agriculture and}} favored fertile lands; they {{brought with them}} and disseminated the inventions, including a variety of tools, and other achievements of La Tène culture. Celtic farmers used plows with iron shares and fertilized fields with animal manure. Their livestock consisted of selected breeds, especially sheep and large cattle. The rotational querns that they invented had a stationary lower stone and an upper one rotated by a lever. Iron was obtained in greater quantities from locally available turf ores; its metallurgy and processing were improved, resulting in the manufacturing of stronger and more resistant tools and weapons. The ceramic shops used the potter's wheel and produced with great precision (especially the Tyniec group) baked, thin walled, painted vessels, {{one of the best}} in Europe. Domed bilevel furnaces were used, the pots being placed on a perforated clay shelf, with the hearth underneath. Glass and enamel were produced, gold and <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stones</b> were processed for jewelry.|$|E
5|$|The last {{mentioned}} specimen {{comes from}} the Olsztyn group burial ground in Tumiany. The Olsztyn group represents the late phase of the Western Baltic cultural circle, with the beginnings {{in the second half}} of the 5th century and the developed stages in 6th and 7th centuries. It was located in Masuria, partially in areas vacated by the Wielbark culture people. The group is believed to have been established by branches of the Galindians tribe, including a part of it that migrated to southern Europe and then returned to the Baltic area. The Olsztyn group cemeteries contain horse burials and many sophisticated style plate clasps, buckles, connectors and other objects made of bronze, silver and gold, studded with <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stones</b> and decorated with engravings, which demonstrate its people's extensive interregional and far reaching trade and other relationships and contacts, that included Scandinavia, western, southern and southeastern Europe.|$|E
50|$|Non-metallic mineral {{resources}} {{play a significant}} role in Azerbaijan's total balance of row material resources. That group of row materials includes rock salt, gypsum, anhydrite, alum, bentonite clay, construction materials, pyrite, borate, gemstones (precious and <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone),</b> dolomite, Iceland spar, etc.|$|R
50|$|Charms, often cut in {{precious}} or <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone,</b> had protective power. Figurines, manufactured from bronze, lead, or terracotta, were {{pierced with}} pins or nails, {{and used to}} cast spells. Curse tablets made from marble or metal (especially lead) were used for curses.|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of silver punch-marked coins and a few gold coins have been {{unearthed}} from Chandraketugarh, including a gold coin of Chandragupta-Kumardevi. A {{large number of}} <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone</b> beads were also found here, along with items made of ivory and bone. Even a few wooden objects have survived.|$|R
5|$|The {{pavilion}} is rectangular in shape, {{situated in}} the west of Sheesh Mahal, and is prominent because of its centrally arched and extraordinarily curved roof. This unique feature is symbolic of Shajahani architecture. It reflects a mixture of contemporary traditions (at {{the time of its}} construction) of sloping-roof from Bengal, and Baldachin from Europe. This demonstrates the imperial as well as religious image of the subject. The original roof was probably gilded. The inner walls are minutely inlaid with precious and <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stones</b> and silver with delicate parchin kari ornamentation are considered among the finest in the world.Glazed tile mosaics have been used to decorate the spandrels of the arched openings with floral designs and images of angels, genies, and solomonic symbols. The marble screens of the pavilion are crowned with merlons to prevent inmates being seen from the grounds in between the Fort and the river. The overall quadrangle comprises private quarters for royal family and closely resembles Agra fort.|$|E
5|$|When {{merchant}} ships docked, {{the merchandise}} {{was taken into}} official custody and taxes levied on all items sold. The security of the merchandise was guaranteed by the administration officials. Traders of many nationalities (Arabs, Persians, Guzerates, Khorassanians) settled in Calicut, drawn by the thriving trade business. Ship building prospered and keeled ships of 1000–1200 bahares (burden) were built without decks by sewing the entire hull with ropes rather than fastening them with nails. Ships sailed to the Red Sea ports of Aden and Mecca with Vijayanagara goods sold {{as far away as}} Venice. The empire's principal exports were pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, myrobalan, tamarind timber, anafistula, precious and <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stones,</b> pearls, musk, ambergris, rhubarb, aloe, cotton cloth and porcelain. Cotton yarn was shipped to Burma and indigo to Persia. Chief imports from Palestine were copper, quicksilver (mercury), vermilion, coral, saffron, coloured velvets, rose water, knives, coloured camlets, gold and silver. Persian horses were imported to Cannanore before a two-week land trip to the capital. Silk arrived from China and sugar from Bengal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} middles ages, there were {{distinct}} material cultures {{evident in the}} different linguistic groups, federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland. Pictish art {{can be seen in}} the extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus). It can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hordes like the St Ninian's Isle Treasure. Irish-Scots art from the Kingdom of Dál Riata is much more difficult to identify, but may include items like the Hunterston brooch, which with other items like the Monymusk Reliquary, suggest that Dál Riata was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed. Insular art is the name given to the common style that developed in Britain and Ireland after the conversion of the Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles, and which became highly influential in continental Europe, contributing to the development of Romanesque and Gothic styles. It can be seen in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stones,</b> in the heavily carved High crosses found most frequently in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, which may have been begun, or wholly created on Iona.

5000|$|There {{are seven}} glass {{vessels in the}} collection, but {{a larger number of}} pieces in {{transparent}} rock crystal or quartz, a mineral that might easily be taken for glass. This was always a much more valuable and prestigious material, qualifying as a <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone.</b> Needing very patient grinding and drilling, it is much harder to work than glass (though correspondingly less easy to break once finished), and the pieces include mounts or bases in precious metal, which none of the actual glass has; nor are the rock crystal pieces painted. Read's catalogue groups these and other pieces in <b>semi-precious</b> <b>stone</b> with the objects in gold, as opposed to the [...] "silver plate", which probably reflects how a Renaissance collector would have ranked them. There are ten pieces in crystal and nine in other stones.|$|R
