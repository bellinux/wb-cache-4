She also {{continued}} to help raise her younger brother and sister, studied <b>stenography</b> and the law, and {{worked as a}} secretary. In 1913, Hobbs graduated from Willamette University College of Law with a Bachelor of Laws degree, and was admitted to the Oregon State Bar.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} stipulated in Part XVII of the Constitution for switching to Hindi as primary official language approached, {{the central government}} stepped up its efforts to spread Hindi's official usage. In 1960, compulsory training for Hindi typing and <b>stenography</b> was started. The same year, India's president Rajendra Prasad acted on the Pant Committee's recommendations and issued orders for preparation of Hindi glossaries, translating procedural literature and legal codes to Hindi, imparting Hindi education to government employees and other efforts for propagating Hindi.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{was born}} on May 8, 1883, in Bloomington, Nebraska, to John Alden Hobbs and Cora Bush Hobbs. Her family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah when she was six years old; she lived there for 12 years, {{finishing}} high school. Her father then met with financial difficulties, and she moved to Oregon, settling in Hillsboro. There, she put her younger brother and sister through school, while studying <b>stenography</b> and working for a living.|$|E

It has {{also contributed to the}} success of publishing <b>stenographies</b> during the Meiji era.Kaidan Botan Dōrō has had a notable influence on consequent versions, which are usually loosely based in San'yūtei's version of the story, including most theatre and cinematographic productions of the myth.|$|R
50|$|Around 1900, Stahl was in France, {{where he}} {{published}} {{a guide to}} the Duployan method and a stenotype how-to: La machine à écrire—machine à <b>stenographier.</b> He fell deeply in love with a Blanche-Alexandrine Francis Boeuve, who taught at her mother's school in Bucharest. She was three years his senior, had worked as a seamstress, and had French Jewish origins. From a previous relationship, Blanche had a six-year-old son, Gaston.|$|R
2500|$|Many scholars, e.g. John DeFrancis, reject {{this class}} {{or at least}} {{labeling}} hangul as such. The Korean script is a conscious script creation by literate experts, which Daniels calls a [...] "sophisticated grammatogeny". These include <b>stenographies</b> and constructed scripts of hobbyists and fiction writers (such as Tengwar), many of which feature advanced graphic designs corresponding to phonologic properties. The basic unit of writing in these systems can map to anything from phonemes to words. It {{has been shown that}} even the Latin script has sub-character [...] "features".|$|R
25|$|The Romanian <b>stenography</b> was {{developed}} by Margaretta Sfințescu in the 1980s. Like French Duployan, Romanian <b>stenography</b> uses {{a large number of}} affix marks and word signs.|$|E

25|$|Most Duployan scripts do {{not make}} use of true {{ligatures}} that are not just one of its constituent letters with a distinguishing mark. The Romanian <b>stenography</b> is fairly unusual in having a number of vowel ligatures, especially with the Romanian U.|$|E
25|$|Geometric shorthands {{are based}} on circles, parts of circles, and {{straight}} lines placed strictly horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The first modern shorthand systems were geometric. Examples include Pitman Shorthand, Boyd's Syllabic Shorthand, Samuel Taylor's Universal <b>Stenography,</b> the French Prévost-Delaunay, and the Duployé system, adapted to write the Kamloops Wawa (used for Chinook Jargon) writing system.|$|E
25|$|Because {{different}} {{programs are}} produced under different conditions, {{a case-by-case basis}} must consequently determine captioning methodology. Some bulletins may have {{a high incidence of}} truly live material, or insufficient access to video feeds and scripts may be provided to the captioning facility, making <b>stenography</b> unavoidable. Other bulletins may be pre-recorded just before going to air, making pre-prepared text preferable.|$|E
25|$|This {{table lists}} the {{characters}} used {{in all of}} the Duployan shorthands along with their Unicode code points. A basic alphabetization can be derived from the order of the letters. Letters with a name otherwise identical to a more universal letter will have a parenthetical denoting its shorthand of use: (Per) for Pernin's Universal Phonography, (Rom) for Romanian <b>stenography,</b> and (Sl) for Sloan-Duployan shorthand.|$|E
25|$|Duployan is {{classified}} as a geometric <b>stenography,</b> in that the prototype for letterforms are based on lines and circles, instead of ellipses. It is alphabetic, with both consonant and vowel signs in equal prominence. Writing is in a left-to-right direction, proceeding down the page, as in common European writing. Most Duployan letters will attach to adjacent letters, allowing a word (or words) to be written in a single stroke, without lifting the pen.|$|E
25|$|In Australia and the United Kingdom, hybrid methodologies {{have proven}} to {{be the best way to}} provide comprehensive, {{accurate}} and cost-effective captions on news and current affairs programs. News captioning applications currently available are designed to accept text from a variety of inputs: <b>stenography,</b> Velotype, QWERTY, ASCII import, and the newsroom computer. This allows one facility to handle a variety of online captioning requirements and to ensure that captioners properly caption all programs.|$|E
25|$|Shorthand is an {{abbreviated}} symbolic writing method that increases speed and brevity of writing {{as compared to}} longhand, a more common method of writing a language. The process of writing in shorthand is called <b>stenography,</b> from the Greek stenos (narrow) and graphein (to write). It has also been called brachygraphy, from Greek brachys (short) and tachygraphy, from Greek tachys (swift, speedy), depending on whether compression or speed of writing is the goal.|$|E
25|$|Script-geometric, or semi-script, shorthands {{are based}} on the ellipse. Semi-script can be {{considered}} a compromise between the geometric systems and the script systems. The first such system was that of George Carl Märes in 1885. However, the most successful system of this type was Gregg shorthand, introduced by John Robert Gregg in 1888. Gregg had studied not only the geometric English systems, but also the German Stolze <b>stenography,</b> a script shorthand. Other examples include Teeline Shorthand and Thomas Natural Shorthand.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} into a musical family with his father, Benjamin Akono Yankson, being a trumpeter with the Apam Brass Band, and his mother Akua Doma, a singer in the Christ Little Band of the Methodist Church. He {{attended}} Takoradi Methodist School for his primary education and proceeded to Ahantaman Secondary Commercial School, from which he graduated with a certificate in <b>stenography.</b> Throughout his early life, he had the desire to be a musician and would regularly sing along with his mother whenever she sung. His parents, though, wanted him to go into business.|$|E
25|$|Typically, female Yeoman reservists {{performed}} {{clerical duties}} such as typing, <b>stenography,</b> bookkeeping, accounting, inventory control, and telephone operation. A few became radio operators, electricians, draftsmen, pharmacists, photographers, telegraphers, fingerprint experts, chemists, torpedo assemblers and camouflage designers. Female Yeomen {{did not attend}} boot camp. A large number were stationed in Washington, D.C., while others served in naval stations, hospitals, shipyards and munitions factories around the country. Many recruiting stations employed the women who volunteered there as very effective recruiters, {{and as many as}} forty women served in England, France, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Canal Zone, Guam, and the Territory of Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|As {{an amateur}} linguist, Evans was {{acquainted with the}} Devanagari script used in British India; in Devanagari, each letter stands for a syllable, and is {{modified}} to represent the vowel of that syllable. Such a system, now called an abugida, readily lent itself to writing a language such as Swampy Cree, which had a simple syllable structure of only eight consonants and four long or short vowels. Evans was also familiar with British shorthand, presumably Samuel Taylor's Universal <b>Stenography,</b> from {{his days as a}} merchant in England; and now he acquired familiarity with the newly published Pitman shorthand of 1837.|$|E
25|$|Real-time stenographers are {{the most}} highly skilled in their profession. <b>Stenography</b> is a system of {{rendering}} words phonetically, and English, with its multitude of homophones (e.g., there, their, they’re), is particularly unsuited to easy transcriptions. Stenographers working in courts and inquiries usually have 24 hours in which to deliver their transcripts. Consequently, they may enter the same phonetic stenographic codes {{for a variety of}} homophones, and fix up the spelling later. Real-time stenographers must deliver their transcriptions accurately and immediately. They must therefore develop techniques for keying homophones differently, and be unswayed by the pressures of delivering accurate product on immediate demand.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} notated {{sources of}} Gregorian chant (written ca. 950) used symbols called neumes (Gr. sign, of the hand) to indicate tone-movements and relative duration within each syllable. A sort of musical <b>stenography</b> {{that seems to}} focus on gestures and tone-movements but not the specific pitches of individual notes, nor the relative starting pitches of each neume. Given the fact that Chant was learned in an oral tradition in which the texts and melodies were sung from memory, this was obviously not necessary. The neumatic manuscripts display great sophistication and precision in notation and a wealth of graphic signs to indicate the musical gesture and proper pronunciation of the text.|$|E
25|$|While {{he wrote}} for various {{magazines}} during his early life, as a contributing writer to the New York Sun, Overland Monthly, Black Cat, Illustrated Monthly, and Sunset Magazine, he turned from it after high school to start {{a career in the}} railroad industry by becoming a clerk in the mechanical department of the Santa Fe Railroad in San Bernardino. This job was short lived, as he moved to the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1891 as a ticket clerk in San Bernardino. While there, he began his training in managing a railroad. In between shifts, he tutored individuals in mathematics, and learned telegraphy and <b>stenography,</b> and he continued to write, submitting short pieces to eastern magazines.|$|E
25|$|Jean Bolikango {{was born}} in Léopoldville, Belgian Congo, on 4 February 1909 to a Bangala family from the Équateur Province. In 1917 he {{enrolled}} in St. Joseph's Institute, graduating in December 1925 {{after six years of}} primary school, two years of pedagogical studies, and one year of <b>stenography</b> and typing courses. He became a licensed primary school teacher the following year. Bolikango taught at Scheutist schools and finally St. Joseph's Institute until 1958. He instructed a total of 1,300 students, including future Prime Minister Joseph Iléo, future Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula, future Minister of Finance Arthur Pinzi, future Minister of Social Affairs Jacques Massa, future dramatist Albert Mongita, and future Catholic Cardinal Joseph Malula. In 1946 he became the president of the Association des Anciens élèves des pères de Scheut (ADAPÉS), a position he held until his death.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "major consequence" [...] of the typewriter's {{development}} was {{the entrance of}} women into the clerical work force. Although women were already employed in factories and certain service industries in the 1880s, the typewriter facilitated an influx of women into office settings. Before the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) established the first typing school in 1881, women were trained by the manufacturer and their typing services provided to customers along with the machine. The expansion of correspondence and paper work that demanded the efficiency of typewriters, however, also created demand for additional clerical workers. The low wages accepted by women—often 50% (or less) of those paid to a man—made them more attractive economically to businesses when filling the new positions. As typing and <b>stenography</b> positions could pay up to ten times more than those in factories, women were attracted in large numbers to office work. In 1874, less than 4% of clerical workers in the United States were women; by 1900, the number had increased to approximately 75%. Before his death, Sholes remarked of the typewriter, [...] "I do feel that I have done something for {{the women who have}} always had to work so hard. This will enable them more easily to earn a living." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Duployan shorthand, or Duployan <b>stenography</b> (...) , {{was created}} by Father Émile Duployé in 1860 for writing French.

The Duployan <b>stenography</b> is classified as a geometric, alphabetic, <b>stenography</b> and is written left-to-right in connected stenographic style. The Duployan shorthands, including Chinook writing, Pernin's Universal Phonography, Perrault's English Shorthand, the Sloan-Duployan Modern Shorthand, and Romanian <b>stenography,</b> were included as a single script in version 7.0 of the Unicode Standard / ISO 10646 ...|$|E

2500|$|Horowitz {{is the son}} of Phil and Blanche Horowitz, {{who were}} high school teachers. His father taught English and his mother taught <b>stenography.</b> During years of labor {{organizing}} and the Great Depression, Phil and Blanche Horowitz were long-standing members of the American Communist Party and strong supporters of Joseph Stalin.

It would be Olof Celsius who finally published his father's discovery.|$|E
2500|$|Ching {{was educated}} in a one-room schoolhouse. [...] When he was 16, {{he was a}} spectator in a local courtroom, and the {{experience}} inspired {{him to become a}} lawyer. He attended Prince of Wales College, a college preparatory academy, after a well-off uncle paid for his high school education. [...] He transferred to a local business college and studied bookkeeping and <b>stenography.</b> [...] In 1895, he left Prince Edward Island to work for an Albertan grain elevator company.|$|E
2500|$|An {{interest}} in shorthand or [...] "short-writing" [...] developed {{towards the end}} of the 16th century in England. In 1588 Timothy Bright published his Characterie; An Arte of Shorte, Swifte and Secrete Writing by Character which introduced a system with 500 arbitrary symbols each representing one word. Bright's book was followed by a number of others, including John Willis's Art of <b>Stenography</b> in 1602, Edmond Willis's An abbreviation of writing by character in 1618, and Thomas Shelton's Short Writing in 1626 (later re-issued as Tachygraphy).|$|E
2500|$|These {{characters}} have rectangular blocks called cells [...] that have tiny bumps called raised dots. The number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from another. Since the various braille alphabets originated as transcription codes for printed writing, the mappings (sets of character designations) vary from language to language. Furthermore, in Eng Braille {{there are three}} levels of encoding: Grade 1 – a letter-by-letter transcription used for basic literacy; Grade 2 – an addition of abbreviations and contractions; and Grade 3 – various non-standardized personal <b>stenography.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Japanese {{shorthand}} systems ('sokki' shorthand or 'sokkidou' <b>stenography)</b> commonly use a syllabic approach, {{much like}} the common writing system for Japanese (which has actually two syllabaries in everyday use). There are several semi-cursive systems. Most follow a left-to-right, top-to-bottom writing direction. Several systems incorporate a loop into many of the strokes, giving the appearance of Gregg, Graham, or Cross's Eclectic shorthand without actually functioning like them. [...] The Kotani (aka Same-Vowel-Same-Direction or SVSD or V-type) system's strokes frequently cross over each other {{and in so doing}} form loops.|$|E
2500|$|President Ingersoll {{believed}} the school neglected special programs for women. Despite {{the reluctance of}} the institution's governing board, CAC began {{opening the door to}} liberal arts in 1885, and by Ingersoll's last year at CAC the college had instituted a [...] "Ladies Course" [...] that offered junior and senior women classes in drawing, <b>stenography</b> and typewriting, foreign languages, landscape gardening and psychology. Ingersoll's belief in liberal yet practical education conflicted with the narrower focus of the State Board of Agriculture, and a final clash in April 1891 led to his resignation. In 1884, CAC would celebrate the commencement of its first three graduates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{status of}} women in Mexico became an issue during the Mexican Revolution, with Francisco I. Madero, the {{challenger}} to the continued presidency of Porfirio Diaz interested in the rights of Mexican women. Madero was part of a rich estate-owning family in the northern state of Coahuila, who had attended University of California, Berkeley briefly and traveled in Europe, absorbing liberal ideas and practices. Madero's wife as well as his female personal assistant, Soledad González, [...] "unquestionably enhanced his interest in women's rights." [...] González was one of the orphans that the Maderos adopted; she learned typing and <b>stenography,</b> and traveled to Mexico City following Madero's election as president in 1911. Madero's brief presidential term was tumultuous, and with no previous political experience, Madero was unable to forward the cause of women's suffrage.|$|E
