40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Fiesta de Los Angeles Queen, Mrs. Modini-Wood, ca. 1895. Mrs. Wood {{can be seen}} standing at right clothed in a florally embroidered dressed {{that appears to be}} silk or satin. The long trail of the dress extends behind her to the left. A jeweled metal belt hangs from her waist. She wears a tiara on her head, which <b>she</b> <b>tilts</b> slightly to the right. She appears to be middle-aged.

60|$|With this, <b>she</b> <b>tilted</b> {{some of the}} {{contents}} of the little bottle on to one of the little bits of flannel, and, again imparting some of the virtues of that preparation to one of the little brushes, began rubbing and scraping away with both on the crown of Steerforth's head in the busiest manner I ever witnessed, talking all the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must go now," [...] he said, slowly, {{as though}} the bald words had a higher significance. She tried to look at him, and could not. His arms circled her, with frightened happiness. <b>She</b> <b>tilted</b> back her head, {{and there was the}} ever-new {{surprise}} of blue irises under dark brows. Uplifted wonder her eyes spoke. His head drooped till he kissed her lips. The two bodies clamored for each other. But she unwound his arms, crying, [...] "No, no, no!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The sky had cleared. <b>She</b> <b>tilted</b> up {{her chin}} and adored the stars--stars like the hard, cold, {{fighting}} sparks that fly from a trolley-wire. Carl looked down fondly, noting how fair-skinned was her forehead in contrast to her thick, dark brows, as the arc-light's brilliance rested on her worshiping face--her lips a-tremble and slightly parted. She raised her arms, her fingers wide-spread, praising the star-gods. She cried only, [...] "Oh, all this----" [...] {{but it was a}} prayer to a greater god Pan, shaking his snow-incrusted beard to the roar of northern music. To Carl her cry seemed to pledge faith in the starred sky and the long trail and a glorious restlessness that by a dead fireplace of white, smooth marble would never find content.|$|E

6000|$|But Mrs. Barker, though inexperienced in love, {{was a good}} fighter. The best of the sex are. She {{dropped into}} the rocking-chair, and began rocking {{backwards}} and forwards while still tugging at her gloves, and said, in a gradually warming voice, [...] "I certainly shall not magnify Mr. Van Loo's silliness to that importance. And I have yet to learn {{what you mean by}} talking about a rendezvous! And I want to know," [...] she continued, suddenly stopping her rocking and tilting the rockers impertinently behind her, as, with her elbows squared on the chair arms, <b>she</b> <b>tilted</b> her own face defiantly up into Mrs. Horncastle's, [...] "how a woman in your position--who doesn't live with her husband--dares to talk to ME!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{girl would}} have been {{striking}} in any company. Neale thought her neither beautiful nor pretty, but he kept on looking. Her arms were bare, her dress cut very low. Her face offered vivid contrast to the carmine on her lips. It was a round, soft face, with narrow eyes, dark, seductive, bold. <b>She</b> <b>tilted</b> {{her head to one}} side and suddenly smiled at Neale. It startled him. It was a smile with the shock of a bullet. It held Neale, so that when she crossed to him he could not move. He felt rather than saw Hough return to his side. The girl took hold of the lapels of Neale's coat. She looked up. Her eyes were dark, with what seemed red shadows deep in them. She had white teeth. The carmined lips curled in a smile--a smile, impossible to believe, of youth and sweetness, that disclosed a dimple in her cheek. She was pretty. She was holding him, pulling him a little toward her.|$|E
60|$|Now {{that the}} queen was {{at ease in}} her mind once more, and measurably happy, her wine {{naturally}} began to assert itself again, and it got a little the start of her. I mean it set her music going--her silver bell of a tongue. Dear me, she was a master talker. It would not become me {{to suggest that it}} was pretty late and that I was a tired man and very sleepy. I wished I had gone off to bed when I had the chance. Now I must stick it out; there was no other way. So she tinkled along and along, in the otherwise profound and ghostly hush of the sleeping castle, until by and by there came, as if from deep down under us, a far-away sound, as of a muffled shriek --with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl. The queen stopped, and her eyes lighted with pleasure; <b>she</b> <b>tilted</b> her graceful head as a bird does when it listens. The sound bored its way up through the stillness again.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's kind of you. I feel to want it, tu." [...] And, {{putting it}} to her lips, <b>she</b> drank, <b>tilting</b> back her head. Perhaps it was the {{tell-tale}} softness of her u's, perhaps the naturally strong lines of her figure thus bent back, but somehow the plumage of the town bird seemed to drop off her suddenly.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Kenton {{had gone}} to Ellen's room again when she had got the judge off upon his mission. She rather flung in upon her. [...] "Oh, you are up!" [...] she apologized to Ellen's back.

50|$|The Queen {{is still}} riding when Antonio jumps out pistol in hand {{demanding}} she stands and fights. Dismounting, the Queen draws her rapier and dagger to face Antonio similarly armed. <b>She</b> <b>tilts</b> her head back, {{her long hair}} flowing, and they take up the same stance and clash swords and daggers. Antonio recognizes her style as having been taught by Maestro Torres. He is shocked when she calls his name and they clash again and Antonio loses his dagger and the Queen retreats to be confronted again by Antonio more determined than ever, and as he forces her against a wall and {{with his free hand}} removes her mask, he gasps upon discovering it is Tessa Alvarado.He leaves and returns to Santa Helena and Montoya's office and finds Captain Grisham and demands the gold, throwing down the Queen's mask. Grisham refuses without proof and Antonio knocks him out and takes the gold, killing a guard on his exit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Him lack for friends!" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>tilted</b> {{her head}} up with a frank pride-- [...] "why, Washington, you can't name a man that's anybody that isn't fond of him. I'll tell you privately, that I've had Satan's own time {{to keep them from}} {{appointing}} him to some office or other. They knew he'd no business with an office, just as well as I did, but he's the hardest man to refuse anything to, a body ever saw. Mulberry Sellers with an office! laws goodness, you know what that would be like. Why, they'd come from {{the ends of the earth}} to see a circus like that. I'd just as lieves be married to Niagara Falls, and done with it." [...] After a reflective pause she added--having wandered back, in the interval, to the remark that had been her text: [...] "Friends?--oh, indeed, no man ever had more; and such friends: Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Johnston, Longstreet, Lee--many's the time they've sat in that chair you're sitting in--" [...] Hawkins was out of it instantly, and contemplating it with a reverential surprise, and with the awed sense of having trodden shod upon holy ground-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mmm!" [...] {{the elder}} grumbled, not wholly pleased, {{and yet not}} refusing the answer. He had been having a little touch of grippe, and was {{somewhat}} broken from his wonted cynicism. He said: [...] "It's very strange, very sad. Just now {{there was such a}} pretty young girl, so sweet and fine, went tottering by as helpless, in any exigency, as the daughter of a thousand years of bound-feet Chinese women. While <b>she</b> <b>tilted</b> on, the nice young fellow with her swept forward with one stride to her three on the wide soles and low heels of nature-last boots, and kept himself from out-walking her by a devotion that made him grit his teeth. Probably she was wiser and better and brighter than he, but she didn't look it; and I, who voted to give her the vote the other day, had my misgivings. I think I shall satisfy myself {{for the next five years}} by catching cold in taking my hat off to her in elevators, and getting killed by automobiles in helping her off the cars, where I've given her my seat." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her admiration made {{no visible}} {{impression}} upon Cornelia, {{and for a}} moment she looked a little disappointed; then she took a basket from under the table, and drew from it a bottle of some yellowish liquid, an orange and a bit of sponge cake. [...] "Are you going to have yours here?" [...] she asked, as Cornelia opened a paper with the modest sandwich in it which she had made at breakfast, and fetched from her boarding-house. [...] "Oh, I'm so glad you haven't brought anything to drink with you! I felt almost sure you hadn't, and now you've got to share mine." [...] She took a cup from her basket, and in spite of Cornelia's protest that she never drank anything but water at dinner, she poured it full of tea for her. [...] "I'll drink out of the bottle," [...] she said. [...] "I like to. Some of the girls bring chocolate, but I think there's nothing like cold tea for the brain. Chocolate's so clogging; so's milk; but sometimes I bring that; it's glorious, drinking it out of the can." [...] <b>She</b> <b>tilted</b> the bottle to her lips, and half drained it at a draught. [...] "I always feel that I'm working with inspiration after I've had my cold tea. Of course they won't let you stay here long," [...] she added.|$|E

60|$|There are {{few things}} sweeter {{in this world}} than the guileless, hot-headed, intemperate, open admiration of a junior. Even {{a woman in her}} blindest devotion does not fall into the gait of the man <b>she</b> adores, <b>tilt</b> her bonnet to the angle at which he wears his hat, or interlard her speech with his pet oaths. And Charlie did all these things. Still it was {{necessary}} to salve my conscience before I possessed myself of Charlie's thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|Most of {{the spectators}} were too {{attentive}} to the play to have many thoughts for each other; but before long I noticed a lady who evidently had an eye for her neighbours {{as well as for}} the table. She was seated about half-way between my friend and me, and I presently observed that she was trying to catch his eye. Though at Homburg, as people said, [...] "one could never be sure," [...] I yet doubted whether this lady were one of those whose especial vocation it was to catch a gentleman's eye. She was youthful rather than elderly, and pretty rather than plain; indeed, a few minutes later, when I saw her smile, I thought her wonderfully pretty. She had a charming gray eye and a good deal of yellow hair disposed in picturesque disorder; and though her features were meagre and her complexion faded, she gave one a sense of sentimental, artificial gracefulness. She was dressed in white muslin very much puffed and filled, but a trifle the worse for wear, relieved here and there by a pale blue ribbon. I used to flatter myself on guessing at people's nationality by their faces, and, as a rule, I guessed aright. This faded, crumpled, vaporous beauty, I conceived, was a German--such a German, somehow, as I had seen imagined in literature. Was she not a friend of poets, a correspondent of philosophers, a muse, a priestess of aesthetics--something in the way of a Bettina, a Rahel? My conjectures, however, were speedily merged in wonderment as to what my diffident friend was making of her. She caught his eye at last, and raising an ungloved hand, covered altogether with blue-gemmed rings--turquoises, sapphires, and lapis--she beckoned him to come to her. The gesture was executed with a sort of practised coolness, and accompanied with an appealing smile. He stared a moment, rather blankly, unable to suppose that the invitation was addressed to him; then, as it was immediately repeated with a good deal of intensity, he blushed to the roots of his hair, wavered awkwardly, and at last made his way to the lady's chair. By the time he reached it he was crimson, and wiping his forehead with his pocket-handkerchief. <b>She</b> <b>tilted</b> back, looked up at him with the same smile, laid two fingers on his sleeve, and said something, interrogatively, to which he replied by a shake of the head. She was asking him, evidently, if he had ever played, and he was saying no. Old players have a fancy that when luck has turned her back on them they can put her into good-humour again by having their stakes placed by a novice. Our young man's physiognomy had seemed to his new acquaintance to express the perfection of inexperience, and, like a practical woman, she had determined to make him serve her turn. Unlike most of her neighbours, she had no little pile of gold before her, but she drew from her pocket a double napoleon, put it into his hand, and bade him place it on a number of his own choosing. He was evidently filled with a sort of delightful trouble; he enjoyed the adventure, but he shrank from the hazard. I would have staked the coin on its being his companion's last; for although she still smiled intently as she watched his hesitation, there was anything but indifference in her pale, pretty face. Suddenly, in desperation, he reached over and laid the piece on the table. My attention was diverted at this moment by my having to make way for a lady with a great many flounces, before me, to give up her chair to a rustling friend to whom she had promised it; when I again looked across at the lady in white muslin, she was drawing in a very goodly pile of gold with her little blue-gemmed claw. Good luck and bad, at the Homburg tables, were equally undemonstrative, and this happy adventuress rewarded her young friend for the sacrifice of his innocence with a single, rapid, upward smile. He had innocence enough left, however, to look round the table with a gleeful, conscious laugh, in the midst of which his eyes encountered my own. Then suddenly the familiar look which had vanished from his face flickered up unmistakably; it was the boyish laugh of a boyhood's friend. Stupid fellow that I was, I had been looking at Eugene Pickering! ...|$|E

5000|$|Eames {{appeared}} in the fourteenth season of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, having been promoted to Lieutenant in the joint City/Federal Homeland Security Task Force. She {{appeared in}} the fourth episode, [...] "Acceptable Loss", as the SVU squad crosses paths with Eames when their investigation of a sex trafficking ring uncovers a connection to a terrorism case on which Eames is working. She tells the detectives to stand down and briefs them on her investigation. After SVU goes forward with their prostitution investigation, Eames blames SVU for making her lose her target. When Detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) realizes {{that one of the}} alleged working girls was connected to the terrorism plot, Captain Don Cragen (Dann Florek) calls Eames in and Benson pleads with her to let them work the raid with her. Eames agrees, and they foil the terrorism plot. At the end of the episode, Benson asks Eames why <b>she</b> <b>tilts</b> her head at suspects while interrogating them, and Eames responds that it was something her former partner (presumably Goren) taught her. She briefly mentions that her partner moved on after 11 years of working together, and for her it was also time for a change.
