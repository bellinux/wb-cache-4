5|$|Despite {{the total}} income from these {{projects}} the company continued {{to lose money}} and Jobs, {{as chairman of the}} board and now the full owner, often considered selling it. Even as late as 1994 Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to other companies such as Hallmark Cards, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and Oracle CEO and co-founder Larry Ellison. Only after learning from New York critics that Toy Story would probably be a hit—and confirming that Disney would distribute it for the 1995 Christmas season—did he decide to give Pixar another chance. For the first time, he also took an active leadership role in the company and made himself CEO. Toy Story went on to gross more than $362million worldwide and, when Pixar held its initial public offering on November 29, 1995, it exceeded Netscape's as the biggest IPO of the year. In only its first half-hour of trading Pixar <b>stock</b> <b>shot</b> from $22 to $45, delaying trading because of un-matched buy orders. Shares climbed to $49 before closing the day at $39.|$|E
50|$|This {{frequent}} use of stock footage saved production money, but often resulted in sacrifice of continuity. This was countered by cutting from one <b>stock</b> <b>shot</b> to another after only a second or two, long enough to set the scene but before the eye could notice all of the unexplained errors. This became part of Filmation style during a period when most TV and motion picture production tended to run minimum shots of 4-5 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|Uncivil War Birds {{was filmed}} on August 24-25, 1945. It is {{a remake of}} the 1939 Buster Keaton short Mooching Through Georgia; the <b>stock</b> <b>shot</b> of the union {{lieutenant}} on horseback with his battalion of eight was borrowed from that film. The song [...] "Dixie" [...] replaces the Stooges' regular opening theme of [...] "Three Blind Mice" [...] for this film, and continues as background music for approximately twenty seconds into the opening scene.|$|E

50|$|To portray futuristic-looking {{buildings}} on Earth, the show used <b>stock</b> <b>shots</b> {{of the remaining}} national pavilions of Expo 67, particularly the French and British pavilions as well as shots of the Bonaventure Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.|$|R
5000|$|Serial {{historian}} William C. Cline {{writes that}} The Adventures of Captain Africa is [...] "an obvious remake of The Phantom, it contained many <b>stock</b> <b>shots</b> {{from the earlier}} release and at times seemed almost like a repeat run." ...|$|R
5000|$|Several bars of Stu Phillips' {{original}} Battlestar Galactica theme {{are heard}} at several junctions in the show, including when Adama flies the last Viper off the Galactica and when Anders flies the fleet into the sun. The final {{shot of the}} fleet leaving Earth's orbit is an exact recreation of the fleet <b>stock</b> <b>shot</b> from the original series. D'Anna Biers (played by Lucy Lawless) is the only Cylon not to appear in this episode, as her character had stayed on the original 'Cylon' Earth {{at the end of}} [...] "Sometimes a Great Notion." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1971 {{he started}} a series of 13 weekly lectures at London’s National Film Theatre {{on the history of}} the musical. At this time Jenkinson started {{building}} up Filmfinders, as a <b>stock</b> <b>shot</b> library as opposed to being a personal collection. He acquired many Mack Sennett and Laurel and Hardy films from other collectors. It was a group which included Leslie Halliwell (who wrote The Filmgoers' Companion), author William K. Everson, Kevin Brownlow (authority on silent cinema), John Huntley (then at the British Film Institute) and a couple of friends in Hollywood. Bilbow and Jenkinson were dropped in 1975 by the BBC, who had been lobbied by the film industry for a less critical approach.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen La Rivière, {{writer of}} Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, {{considers}} [...] "The Duchess Assignment" [...] {{to have an}} [...] "enjoyable, quirky charm", praising such aspects as the sculpting of the Duchess puppet and praising the episode as [...] "one {{of the most unusual}} episodes in the Anderson canon". Sylvia Anderson commends the originality of Martin Crump's script, and the integration of action sequences into a plot that was [...] "far from futuristic". The Empire State Building is visible in an introductory <b>stock</b> <b>shot</b> of the New York skyline, indicating that the events of this episode predate those of [...] "Terror in New York City" [...] (in which the structure is destroyed).|$|E
5000|$|The ship's name is {{prominently}} {{displayed in}} episode 104 of The Twilight Zone, [...] "The Thirty-Fathom Grave", first aired in 1963.

50|$|It {{consists}} {{of thousands of}} hours of footage relating to London, from <b>stock</b> <b>shots</b> of famous landmarks such as Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey, to news stories such as Diana, Princess of Wales' death and state visits to London from dignitaries such as Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela.|$|R
50|$|EbS was {{launched}} in 1995 {{with the purpose of}} providing TV and radio stations with pictures and sounds coming from the EU, in all EU official languages.

5000|$|Film critic Glenn Erickson {{discussed}} the production {{in his review}} of the film, [...] "The B&W 'Regalscope' format gives this modest production a handsome look, along with Kurt Neumann's competent if not stylish direction. Cameraman Karl Struss (of Murnau's Sunrise) slightly over-lights Kyra in the party scene to make her hair seem to glow, a subtle effect for sure. The hair-color changing is a filter trick, an invention Struss first used back in the silent era. A spectacular car crash murder scene is an RKO <b>stock</b> <b>shot</b> lifted from the 1952 Otto Preminger noir Angel Face and cropped for the 'scope format. It still looks frightening. Suggesting an undeveloped noir angle, a 'haunting' portrait of Kyra becomes the focus of Dan's obsession. It's {{supposed to be the}} work of an Italian master, but looks more like a Paint By Numbers atrocity." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 1 May, The Sun {{claimed to}} have [...] "sponsored" [...] a British missile. Under the {{headline}} [...] "Stick This Up Your Junta: A Sun missile for Galtieri’s gauchos", the newspaper published {{a photograph of a}} missile (actually a Polaris missile <b>stock</b> <b>shot</b> from the Ministry of Defence) which had a large Sun logo printed on its side with the caption [...] "Here It Comes, Senors..." [...] underneath. The paper explained that it was [...] "sponsoring" [...] the missile by contributing to the eventual victory party on [...] when the war ended. In copy written by Wendy Henry, the paper said that the missile would shortly be used against Argentinian forces. Tony Snow, The Sun journalist on Invincible who had [...] "signed" [...] the missile, reported a few days later that it had hit an Argentinian target.|$|E
5000|$|Peter Falk {{selected}} the car personally, after seeing it {{in a parking}} lot at Universal Studios. In the season 5 episode [...] "Identity Crisis", Columbo boasts that the car is a rare automobile, [...] "only three like it in the States". From June 1956 to July 1961 only 2,050 were produced, and only 504 were produced for model year 1959. Though it regularly exhibits mechanical problems large and small, Columbo professes faith in his vehicle, telling a valet, [...] "I've got over 100,000 miles on it. You take care of your car, it'll take care of you." [...] This car can also be seen in a <b>stock</b> <b>shot</b> used {{at the beginning of the}} pilot of The Rockford Files, [...] "The Backlash of the Hunter". The car also made an appearance in an episode of Adam-12.|$|E
50|$|Companies {{throughout}} the world use stock footage in their video productions for in-house meetings, annual conventions, seminars, and other events. It has become popular to videotape interviews of CEOs and other VIPs using a green screen backdrop. When the green is keyed out during post-production, stock footage or <b>stock</b> <b>shots</b> are inserted, to impart a particular message.|$|R
5000|$|Sight and Sound {{reviewer}} Philip Kemp later wrote:"Using unknown {{actors and}} filming {{with no more}} than three minimal sets, a sole exterior (a used-car lot) to represent Los Angeles, a few <b>stock</b> <b>shots,</b> and some shaky back-projection, Ulmer conjures up a black, paranoid vision, totally untainted by glamour, of shabby characters trapped in a spiral of irrational guilt." ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{all three}} series had {{location}} scenes, {{the third was}} more studio based and location scenes were mostly taken from unused and reused <b>stock</b> <b>shots</b> from {{the first and second}} series. A smaller crew went to Wales for this series and more money was saved by shooting without synchronised sound. In the days of enforced demarcation, this saved several technicians' wages.|$|R
50|$|Mahendran had {{a strong}} desire to make a film with Rajini at that time, hence he made this film {{simultaneously}} with Nenjathai Killathey. As the producer could not provide the equipment and facilities for the climax scene with a song, Mahendran was forced to use stock shots and manage to shoot with the limited facilities offered. However, by beautifully mixing the close up shots with <b>stock</b> <b>shot,</b> the scene came out well and was appreciated by everyone. This was the first time for which popular artistes Jayaraj designed the costumes. He first drew the illustrations of scenes with costumes and then got them stitched, bringing in newness and style in Rajinikanth's look which attracted the masses. The scene where Archana proposes Johnny was shot in Ooty in a bungalow atmidnight. When the scene was shot, the whole unit was silent, they saw only the characters of the film, not Rajini and Sridevi. After the scene was shot, Rajini appreciated Sridevi acting and mentioned to Mahendran that though he tried, she overshadowed in the scene.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} {{quality of}} color film stock {{in particular is}} its color balance, which {{is defined by the}} color temperature at which it accurately records white. Tungsten lighting is defined at 3200 K, which is considered [...] "warmer" [...] in tone and shifted towards orange; daylight is defined at 5600 K, which is considered [...] "colder" [...] and shifted towards blue. This means that unfiltered tungsten stock will look normal shot under tungsten lights, but blue if shot during daylight. Conversely, daylight <b>stock</b> <b>shot</b> in daylight will look normal, but orange if shot under tungsten lights. Color temperature issues such as these can be compensated for by other factors such as lens filters and color gels placed in front of the lights. The color temperature of a film stock is generally indicated next to the film speed number — e.g. 500T stock is color film stock with an ASA of 500 and balanced for tungsten light; 250D would have an ASA of 250 and be balanced for daylight. While black-and-white film has no color temperature itself, the silver halide grains themselves tend to be slightly more responsive to blue light, and therefore will have daylight and tungsten speeds — e.g. Kodak's Double-X stock is rated 250D/200T, since the tungsten light will give slightly less exposure than an equivalent amount of daylight.|$|E
5000|$|The sketch was {{included}} in the DVD Monty Python's Flying Circus: Set One—Volume 1, as well as in Monty Python's Flying Circus: Graham Chapman's Personal Best, and also appeared in And Now For Something Completely Different in 1971. In this version the counsellor's description of lions is accompanied by stock footage of a lion charging the camera, which causes Anchovy to recoil in terror. At {{the end of the film}} version Eric Idle appears as a fairy to grant Anchovy's wish of seeing his name in lights, whereupon he turns into the host of [...] "Blackmail". In the Monty Python Live (Mostly) stage show at the O2 (which also features a brief <b>stock</b> <b>shot</b> of a lion, on the overhead screen), the sketch ends with Anchovy telling the counsellor he would rather be... a [...] "systems analyst!" [...] (though on a different evening, his choice of career was a [...] "sperm donor!". Other careers were mentioned on other nights at the O2). In fact this was a red herring as in all instances, the audience were expecting Anchovy to say [...] "lumberjack"...then as Palin (as Anchovy) leaps to his feet he announces he wanted to be... "a lumberjack!", at which point he strips off his suit to reveal a lumberjack's outfit, and the sketch segues into the The Lumberjack Song.|$|E
5000|$|Early IBM tape drives were {{floor-standing}} drives {{that used}} vacuum columns to physically buffer long U-shaped loops of tape. The two tape reels visibly fed tape through the columns, intermittently spinning the reels in rapid, unsynchronized bursts, resulting in visually striking action. <b>Stock</b> <b>shots</b> of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely {{used to represent}} [...] "the computer" [...] in movies and television.|$|R
5000|$|Ron Moore {{said in the}} Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion {{that the}} new ship was {{intended}} to be designated [...] "Defiant-A", {{but it would have been}} too costly to redo the CG model for one episode because <b>stock</b> <b>shots</b> from earlier episodes had to be used as well for budgetary reasons. Nevertheless, Moore stated that as far as he was concerned, the change did happen.|$|R
50|$|The opening credits {{roll over}} a flying, {{nighttime}} <b>stock</b> footage <b>shot</b> of downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.|$|R
2500|$|There {{was very}} little {{location}} work {{and most of the}} series was filmed in the studio with many <b>stock</b> <b>shots</b> of carriages on London Bridge and near Big Ben, giving the impression of London. However, on a few occasions, such as [...] "The Case of the Eiffel Tower", the French filming locations were used. French actors were extensively used in small parts and several affected English accents with varying levels of success.|$|R
50|$|Made on a {{minuscule}} budget, {{the film is}} full of in-jokes and low-budget special effects, just like the original. The characters still dress like in the 1980s. Fantazia now does Internet sex, instead of phone sex with Kyle, Nick has been dishonorably discharged from the United States Army, Daphne is still promiscuous, and Kevin is still henpecked by his frigid girlfriend Amy. Hobgoblins 2 also delivers even more <b>stock</b> <b>shots</b> of explosions and car crashes than the original.|$|R
5000|$|Siegel told Peter Bogdanovich how his montages {{differed}} from the usual ones: Montages were done then as they're done now, oddly enough—very sloppily. The director casually shoots a few shots that he presumes {{will be used in}} the montage and the cutter grabs a few <b>stock</b> <b>shots</b> and walks down with them to the man who's operating the optical printer and tells him to make some sort of mishmash out of it. He does, and that's what's labeled montage.|$|R
5000|$|Production values doomed Bombs Over Burma {{both at the}} {{box office}} and with critics. The review in The New York Times succinctly called it a [...] "dud", loaded with <b>stock</b> <b>shots,</b> even {{recognizable}} [...] "California architecture." [...] Later reviews such as that of Leonard Maltin, noted that the film was an [...] "... interesting if failed attempt to make a hard-hitting, topical film ... Director/cowriter Lewis' visual flair can't save a talky, pedestrian script. Wong comes off well, as usual." ...|$|R
50|$|Back {{projection}} footage seen behind Jeff and Marty in {{the studio}} shot car interiors consisted of footage of Goodge Street, Charlotte Street, Tottenham Court Road and Howland Street. Stock footage depicting London at night {{at the start of}} the episode consisted of shots of Berkely Street, Lambeth Pier and the Houses of Parliament. <b>Stock</b> <b>shots</b> of New Scotland Yard and the British Museum were also used. The street and exterior of Howarth's home were shot on the standing street sets on the backlot at Elstree studios.|$|R
50|$|Storm Catcher is set and filmed {{primarily}} in Los Angeles, California with B-roll footage in Washington, D.C., {{taking place in}} 18 days from October 19 to November 6, 1998.

5000|$|When {{returning}} from an Echo patrol, Androscoggin was dispatched to Nassau {{to take part}} in the filming of the movie Assault on a Queen, starring Frank Sinatra.
