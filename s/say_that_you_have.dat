You may say that you go to work with bright hopes, and that you will not be discouraged by the slowness of your progress; for you have to recover not only what has been lost in transplanting the Negro race from its native soil to this continent, but you must reach higher levels than your ancestors ever had attained.|$|E
500|$|Though {{guest actor}} Leonard Nimoy was {{reluctant}} to return after completing his three-episode commitment on the show that had ended with the season's tenth episode, he returned for the season finale when the producers [...] "essentially called him up and pleaded". They discussed their plans for the character, and [...] "told him {{it was a story}} we couldn't tell without him." [...] He [...] "graciously agreed." [...] "Over There" [...] marked Nimoy's longest appearance on Fringe, a longer and [...] "much more involv" [...] shoot of roughly seven days was required. Despite Leonard Nimoy's planned exit from the show, the show's producers have said that nothing is final in the Fringe world. Pinkner commented that Nimoy's retirement from acting obviously hinders his character's possible return but, [...] "if Leonard chooses to come back, there is a story in place that we'd love to tell." [...] Wyman elaborated that [...] "I think it's fair to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not experienced the last of William Bell". When the producers told Nimoy their ideas for Bell's storyline in the third season, he returned for some brief voice and animation work in the episode [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide".|$|E

6000|$|... "He told me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> {{been sure}} {{to come and}} walk with us, and we <b>have</b> all been <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> disappeared." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear sir, {{there is}} no {{occasion}} {{for us to go}} into strictly professional details together," [...] said he soothingly. [...] "If, for example, I were to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> interstitial keratitis, how would you be the wiser? There are indications of a strumous diathesis.

6000|$|Avoid this sin, and all sins. Let no man {{be able to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{defrauded}} him, {{that you}} have tyrannized over him; that you have neglected to do your duty by him. Let no man be able to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> rewarded him evil for evil. If possible, let him {{not be able to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> even lost your temper with him. Be generous; be forgiving. If you have an opportunity, be like David, and help him who without a cause is your enemy; and then you will have a right to say, like David, 'Give sentence with me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to the cleanness of my hands in thy sight.' ...|$|E
