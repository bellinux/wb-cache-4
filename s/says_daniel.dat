The So Random Christmas special also has a Volde-mart sketch where Voldemort owns a supermarket and can't get any of his Voldemort dolls to sell, and is furious when he finds out that the Harry Potter dolls are flying off the shelves, so furious that he uses the Avada Kedavra curse on a Harry Potter cardboard cutout in similar style to how Ralph Fiennes does the curse when he destroys the Horcrux in Harry in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2.

2500|$|In a 2012 {{profile of}} Silvers, The New York Times noted: [...] "His {{greatest}} pleasure ... is simply good writing, which {{he talks about}} as others talk about fine wine or good food. Speaking about writers he likes, he sometimes flushes with enthusiasm. 'I admire great writers, people with marvelous and beautiful minds, and always hope they will do something special and revealing for us.'" [...] Philip Marino, in The University of Chicago Magazine, commented: [...] "Like a chemist pairing ingredients to induce a specific reaction, Silvers has built his career matching the right author and subject, in hopes of generating an exciting and illuminating result. ... 'he puts a writer together with material that even the writer might not have thought was appropriate,' <b>says</b> <b>Daniel</b> Mendelsohn". Glen Weldon, writing for NPR, concurred: [...] "He encouraged writers to craft each review as a vigorous intellectual argument, and delighted in pairing reviewers with books that challenged their personal or political worldview." [...] Professor Peter Brown wrote: [...] "Reviewing for Bob Silvers was like playing in the sprinkling rain of a mighty fountain ... to be doused in the sheer, bubbling delight of Bob’s own unquenchable enthusiasm and alert, discerning curiosity. It widened the heart". In The Nation, Harvard professor Stanley Hoffmann observed that, in publishing {{some of the earliest}} criticisms of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, Silvers realized what other commentators missed: [...] "In both instances, Bob Silvers was, in effect, whether deliberately or not, compensating for the weaknesses of the more established media. ... It was important that a journal which has the authority of the Review in a sense took up the slack and presented viewpoints which were extremely hard to get into the established media." [...] The Nation added, during the Iraq war:One suspects [...] yearn for the day when they can return to their normal publishing routine – that gentlemanly pastiche of philosophy, art, classical music, photography, German and Russian history, East European politics, literary fiction – unencumbered by political duties of a confrontational or oppositional nature. That day has not yet arrived. If and when it does, let it be said that the editors met the challenges of the post-9/11 era in a way that most other leading American publications did not, and that The New York Review of Books ... was there when we needed it most.|$|E

Betty gently asks how Alex died, and <b>Daniel</b> <b>says</b> he died jumping out of a helicopter to ski on Mt. Juneau; ski lifts were too tedious for him.

The camera shifted to Chase Daniel, who was visibly perplexed and curious as to who was talking about him and why it was being heard throughout the entire stadium. ABC TV announcer Brent Musburger then mused, [...] "Lisa was talking to a lot more folks than she anticipated." [...] The likely explanation was that Salters' mic was to have been hooked up to the PA for the upcoming halftime contest, and her mic was inadvertently left on the PA after a pregame sound check.|$|R

6000|$|Such {{a success}} {{could not be}} {{attained}} without making enemies, perhaps without making mistakes. But the more we study George Buchanan's history, the less we shall be inclined to hunt out his failings, the more inclined to admire his worth. A shrewd, sound-hearted, affectionate man, with a strong love of right and scorn of wrong, and a humour withal which saved him--except on really great occasions--from bitterness, and helped him to laugh where narrower natures would have only snarled,--he is, in many respects, a type of those Lowland Scots, who long preserved his jokes, genuine or reputed, as a common household book. {16} A schoolmaster by profession, and struggling for long years amid the temptations which, in those days, degraded his class into cruel and sordid pedants, he rose from the mere pedagogue to be, {{in the best sense}} of the word, a courtier: [...] "One," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Daniel</b> Heinsius, [...] "who seemed not only born for a court, but born to amend it. He brought to his queen that at which she could not wonder enough. For, by affecting a certain liberty in censuring morals, he avoided all offence, under the cloak of simplicity." [...] Of him and his compeers, Turnebus, and Muretus, and their friend Andrea Govea, Ronsard, the French court poet, said that they had nothing of the pedagogue about them but the gown and cap. [...] "Austere in face, and rustic in his looks," [...] says David Buchanan, [...] "but most polished in style and speech; and continually, even in serious conversation, jesting most wittily." [...] "Rough-hewn, slovenly, and rude," [...] says Peacham, in his [...] "Compleat Gentleman," [...] speaking of him, probably, as he appeared in old age, [...] "in his person, behaviour, and fashion; seldom caring for a better outside than a rugge-gown girt close about him: yet his inside and conceipt in poesie was most rich, and his sweetness and facilitie in verse most excellent." [...] A typical Lowland Scot, as I said just now, he seems to have absorbed all the best culture which France could afford him, without losing the strength, honesty, and humour which he inherited from his Stirlingshire kindred.|$|E

Corman would direct the first unit and Haller would direct second unit - namely, filming all the races on Sunday. However when he got to Europe, Corman had already shot one of the races and told Haller since that Haller knew the script better than Corman did, Haller should direct first unit while Corman did second unit.
