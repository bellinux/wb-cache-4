40|$|Vine copulas are pair-copula constructions {{enabling}} multivariate dependence modeling {{in terms}} of bivariate building blocks. One of the main tasks of fitting a vine copula is {{the selection of a}} suitable tree structure. For this the prevalent method is a heuristic called Dißmann's algorithm. It sequentially constructs the vine's trees by maximizing dependence at each tree level, where dependence is measured {{in terms of}} absolute Kendall's τ. However, the algorithm disregards any implications of the tree structure on the simplifying assumption that is usually made for vine copulas to keep inference tractable. We develop two new algorithms that <b>select</b> <b>tree</b> structures focused on producing simplified vine copulas for which the simplifying assumption is violated as little as possible.

40|$|Theoretical models {{predict that}} animals should make {{foraging}} decisions after assessing {{the quality of}} available habitat, but most models fail to consider the spatio-temporal scales at which animals perceive habitat availability. We tested three foraging strategies that explain how Magellanic woodpeckers (Campephilus magellanicus) assess the relative quality of trees: 1) Woodpeckers with local knowledge <b>select</b> <b>trees</b> based on the available trees in the immediate vicinity. 2) Woodpeckers lacking local knowledge <b>select</b> <b>trees</b> based on their availability at previously visited locations. 3) Woodpeckers using information from long-term memory <b>select</b> <b>trees</b> based on knowledge about trees available within the entire landscape. We observed foraging woodpeckers and used a Brownian Bridge Movement Model to identify trees available to woodpeckers along foraging routes. Woodpeckers <b>selected</b> <b>trees</b> with a later decay stage than available trees. Selection models indicated that preferences of Magellanic woodpeckers were based on clusters of trees near the most recently visited trees, thus suggesting that woodpeckers use visual cues from neighboring trees. In a second analysis, Cox's proportional hazards models showed that woodpeckers used information consolidated across broader spatial scales to adjust tree residence times. Specifically, woodpeckers spent more time at trees with larger diameters and in a more advanced stage of decay than trees available along their routes. These results suggest that Magellanic woodpeckers make foraging decisions based on the relative quality of trees that they perceive and memorize information at different spatio-temporal scales...|$|R
40|$|The objetive of {{this study}} is to cluster <b>selected</b> <b>trees</b> of Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex-Maiden as a {{function}} of phenotypic, dendrometric and wood technology characteristics. In a 27 years old commercial stand, located in the northern coast of Rio Grande do Sul, 63 <b>selected</b> <b>trees</b> were cut down and classified to the phenotypic and dendrometric characteristics. Then, disks were taken at the base, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of the commercial height, and at the DBH, for basic density determination. From the two first logs above the DBH boards parallel to the pith were taken, with 25 mm of thickness, for sawn wood qualitative evaluation.

40|$|Background: Early {{introduction}} of dietary peanut in high-risk infants with severe eczema and/or egg allergy prevented peanut allergy at 5 {{years of age}} in the LEAP Study; the protective effect persisted after 12 months of avoiding peanuts in the LEAP-On Study. It is unclear whether this benefit is allergen and allergic-disease specific. Objective: To assess the impact of early {{introduction of}} peanut on the development of allergic disease, food sensitization and aeroallergen sensitization. Methods: Asthma, eczema and rhinoconjunctivitis were diagnosed by clinical assessment. Reported allergic reactions and consumption of tree nuts and sesame were recorded by questionnaire. Sensitization to food and aeroallergens was determined by skin prick testing and specific IgE measurement. Results: A high and increasing burden of food and aeroallergen sensitization and allergic disease was noted across study time points; 76 % of LEAP participants had at least one allergic disease at 60 months of age. There were no differences in allergic disease between LEAP groups. There were small differences in sensitization and reported allergic reactions for <b>select</b> <b>tree</b> nuts; levels were higher in the LEAP consumption group. Significant resolution of eczema and sensitization to egg and milk occurred in LEAP participants; this was not affected by peanut consumption. Conclusion: Early consumption of peanut in infants at high risk of peanut allergy is allergen-specific and does not prevent the development of other allergic disease, sensitization to other foods and aeroallergens, or reported allergic reactions to tree nuts and sesame. Furthermore, peanut consumption does not hasten the resolution of eczema or egg allergy. <br/...|$|E

40|$|In human-modified {{tropical}} landscapes (HMLs) {{the conservation}} of biodiversity, functions and services of forest ecosystems depends on persistence of old growth forest remnants, forest regeneration in abandoned agricultural fields, and restoration of degraded lands. Understanding the impacts of agricultural land uses (ALUs) on forest regeneration is critical for biodiversity conservation in HMLs. Here, we develop a conceptual framework that considers the availability of propagules and the environment prevailing after field abandonment as two major determinants of forest regeneration in HMLs. The framework proposes that regeneration potential decreases with size, duration and severity of agricultural disturbance, reducing propagule availability and creating ill-suited environmental conditions for regeneration. We used studies from Southern Mexico to assess this framework. First, we identify regeneration bottlenecks that trees face during transit from seed to follow-up life stages, using demographic analysis of dominant pioneer species in recently abandoned fields. Then, we explore effects of ALUs on forest regeneration at the field and landscape scales, addressing major legacies. Finally, we integrate agricultural disturbance with landscape composition to predict attributes of successful second growth forests in HMLs, and provide indicators useful to <b>select</b> <b>tree</b> native species for active restoration. An indicator of disturbance inflicted by ALUs, based on farmers’ information, predicted better regeneration potential than measurements of soil and microclimate conditions at time of abandonment. Cover of cattle pastures in the landscape was a stronger indicator of forest regenerating attributes than cover of old growth forest remnants. To conclude, we offer recommendations to promote forest regeneration and biodiversity conservation in HMLs. </p...|$|E
40|$|Deforestation {{in southwestern}} Nicaragua {{as a result}} of {{converting}} rare dry tropical forest to pastures has created fragmented forest habitats and decreased the potential for this area to continue its historical role as a critical biological corridor. The conservation organization Paso Pacifico works to to increase habitat potential and connectivity in the region via restoration and conservation. Live fence implementation is one potential reforestation method that Paso Pacifico is interested in exploring. Establishing living fence rows would involve a targeted planting of trees along designated boundaries of pastures, producing potential ecological and subsistence benefits of trees without sacrificing grazing land. Living fence rows are already present in southwestern Nicaragua, but they have not been investigated in regards to landowner use and perception or how different taxa respond to them. Our team explored these dimensions for a sample of living fence rows in the region to provide insight necessary for developing a program for promoting living fence rows. We first produced a literature review to assess the dual value living fences present in both working and natural landscapes. Then, we conducted semi-structured interviews with landowners who own living fence rows to investigate their perceptions and use of these features. We also performed biodiversity assessments of these existing fence rows in order to better understand their conservation potential. Our findings are that landowners generally perceive living fence rows to be a worthwhile long-term investment that are useful for humans, cattle, and the environment. We also found that bees of the locally important tribe Meliponini showed a strong positive reaction to the living fences in our sample. Based on these findings, we have developed specific recommendations for how living fence row-based restoration projects could be implemented. Living fence rows would be most valuable to landowners for whom spatial concerns have deterred participation in past reforestation programs. New fences based upon Gliricidia sepium are amenable to current landowner practices and would support meliponine bees. However, multiple other benefits may be created by integrating <b>select</b> <b>tree</b> and plant species into fence row plantings, including the generation of advantageous microclimates from multistrata vegetation. Finally, we recommend areas of future research to further explore the social and ecological dimensions of living fence rows in the region and how Paso Pacifico should design a program for promoting live fences in the region...|$|E

Timber harvesting results for more than 5 million hectares of tropical forest becoming degraded looged-over forests every year without any adequate management. The decrease and degradation of tropical forests caused by anthropological activities affect not only the sustainable production of timber but also global environments. The clarified scientific information on the rehabilitation of degraded tropical forest ecosystems enables managers to devise silvicultural systems which enhance soil properties and forest resources important to sustainable production and minimise deleterious effects associated with harvesting impacts and short rotation of plantation. Rehabilitation is aimed to improve biological diversity, increasing commercial value for timber and non-timber products, increasing forest functions, improve soil fertility. Technically developments are expected for reducing logging impacts, accelerating natural regeneration, species selection, enrichment, sustainable site management, catalytic plantation, site evaluation and classification. Socioeconomic developments are also expected for local community participation and socio-economic acceptability. Following research activities have been considered (1) evaluation of forest harvesting impacts on the forest ecosystems: (i) evaluate logging and yarding methods on disturbance of forest ecosystems, (ii) analyse the demography of regenerated tree population, (iii) model a/de-gradation processes in forest ecosystems, (2) development of methods to rehabilitate logged-over forests and degraded forest lands: (i) treatments accelerating natural regeneration, (ii) development of enrichment planting methods, (3) development of silvicultural techniques on degraded forest lands: (i) development of species-site matching methods, (ii) management options for sustained productivity, (iii) social and economic acceptability of management options.
