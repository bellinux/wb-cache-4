" This paper discusses policy {{issues related to the}} establishment of a primary dealer system for countries that may be considering taking this step. In this regard, a key issue is whether a primary dealer system fits into the overall strategy for financial market development in the country. Under a primary dealer system, the debt manager and the group of primary dealers pursue a common strategy in support of the effective functioning and development of primary and secondary markets for government <b>securities.</b> This paper presents results of a survey of country practices conducted in early 2001.

Although clients should be the owners of their own <b>securities,</b> the Japanese legal system does not give a satisfactory explanation for the ownership of clients 2 Ì† 7 <b>securities</b> as such held by <b>securities</b> firms in certain situations.
