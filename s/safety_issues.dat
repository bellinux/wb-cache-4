5|$|However, <b>safety</b> <b>issues</b> {{continue}} to be a persistent problem in Indonesian aviation. Several accidents have given Indonesia's air transport system the reputation of the least safe in the world. Indonesian aviation faces numerous challenges, including poorly maintained, outdated, and often overwhelmed infrastructure, the factor of human error, bad weather, haze problems caused by plantation fires, and volcanic ash spewed by numerous area volcanoes that disrupts air transportation.|$|E

5|$|In 1948 Britain's railways, {{and hence}} the canal, were nationalised, and became the {{responsibility}} of the British Transport Commission. In 1963 control of the canal passed to British Waterways. Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968, all waterways within the jurisdiction of British Waterways were classified as commercial, cruising or remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those that were deemed to have no economic future, and maintenance would only be carried out where failure to do so would create health or <b>safety</b> <b>issues.</b> The Grantham Canal was listed in this latter category.|$|E

5|$|The <b>safety</b> <b>issues</b> for {{cryogenic}} helium {{are similar}} to those of liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns, and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed.

5|$|An {{investigation}} {{proved that}} the fault lay {{in the construction of}} the bomb's tail; breaking up on impact, a 'safed' bomb would have its arming wire removed, rendering it 'unsafe' and detonating the weapon. Modifications were made to solve the problem, but the damage had been done; the <b>safety</b> <b>issues,</b> increased maintenance costs compared to conventional bombs, the fact that the bomb's guidance system required clear-day use only, rendering the bombers vulnerable to enemy fighters, and required that the weapon be released at a prime altitude for the aircraft to be in danger from enemy flak. These combined with the weapon's poor reliability – only six of twenty-eight bombs dropped successfully destroyed their targets – to result in the production order being canceled by the USAF; following this, the Tarzon program as a whole was terminated in August 1951.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The <b>safety</b> <b>issues</b> caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E

5|$|In May 2009, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) {{announced}} that fixing SR67 was number17 on its priority list, {{resulting in an}} estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway {{that would not be}} limited-access. A month later, Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol agreed to take more efforts to educate the public about the <b>safety</b> <b>issues.</b> Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early December2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR67. Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department. In a 2010 report, Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I-8 to Dye Road in order to improve traffic flow.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Apollo 1 accident which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on <b>safety</b> <b>issues</b> and hazards in NASA's aerospace programs. In {{the aftermath of the}} Shuttle Columbia accident, Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress. By 1971, NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council (NAC).|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 2009, at {{the closing}} {{performance}} of the show Yulong, a set of bleachers with a carrying capacity of 450 people and holding 420 at the time collapsed, sending seven people to the hospital. In the ensuing investigation, it came to light that Juventas had not had the bleachers inspected each time they were set up, as required by their lease with the city. They had been issued a permit in 2006 for the bleachers, and had not had them inspected since. The school was fined $500 and shut down until the legal and <b>safety</b> <b>issues</b> could be fully investigated.
