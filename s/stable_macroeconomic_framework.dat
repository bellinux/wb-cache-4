40|$|Abstract: Europe {{has been}} {{the driving force of}} {{economic}} policy in Spain over the last four decades and the key factor behind the modernisation and globalisation of the Spanish Economy. Being {{a founding member of the}} Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) marked the achievement of one of the key goals in the process of European integration. This process was carried out in several stages. First, trade openness, which was bolstered by Spanish accession to the EEC in 1986 and the single market in 1992, and foreign direct investment abroad and portfolio investment, which grew exponentially in the run-up to Euro membership. Second, the process of nominal convergence, which allowed a more <b>stable</b> <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework.</b> Lower inflation and fiscal consolidation have resulted in higher sustainable growth. However, the process of real integration could have been even more successful. Spain’s income per capita still lies at 84 per cent of the European average. The slow pace of reform, in particular in the labour market, with high labour costs leading to persistent unemployment, and an inappropriate policy-mix in the late 1980 s prevented Spain from reaping the full benefits of integration and of EMU. Achieving real convergence is the key challenge facing the Spanish economy in the future and Europe will remain a focal point in this venture. ...|$|E

30|$|In this section, we lay {{out some}} key facts on youth {{unemployment}} in Greece {{and place them}} in context. We do this from both a time-series and cross-sectional perspective. Specifically, we use aggregate data from Eurostat publications and micro-data from the 2005 - 2012 European Labour Force Survey to examine trends in unemployment, both in Greece itself and also in comparison with a selection of other European states. For these comparisons, we have selected Spain and Portugal as Southern European countries that, like Greece, have experienced serious monetary disturbances as well as labour market dislocation. Although it is not in Southern Europe, we include the Republic of Ireland for the same reasons. Though having a <b>stable</b> <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> in recent years, Sweden has experienced persistently high levels of youth unemployment, especially relative to adult rates, and has also been included. Finally, we add the three largest countries in Europe - Germany, the UK and France - to give a perspective on unemployment trends in the European Union as a whole. These countries also span a variety of experiences during the recession, including wide variations in labour market performance. A referee has pointed out to us that, these eight countries span quite different school-to-work transition patterns: a) France, Greece, Spain, Portugal are the Mediterranean rim; b) Sweden represents the Scandinavian model; c) UK and Ireland represent the Anglo-Saxon model; and d) Germany {{is an example of the}} Central European or Bismarckian model.|$|E

40|$|Europe {{has been}} {{the driving force of}} {{economic}} policy in Spain over the last four decades and the key factor behind the modernization and globalisation of the Spanish Economy. The accession to the EEC in 1986 was a crucial step in the process of economic and political integration. This process was carried out in several stages. First, trade openness. Exports were liberalized well before 1986, while imports boomed from that date onwards. Secondly, foreign direct investment (FDI) into Spain jumped with accession to the EEC. Finally, Spanish FDI abroad and portfolio investment grew exponentially in the run-up to Euro membership in the late 1990 s. Integration has required a set of measures (increased competition, privatisation of public enterprises, industrial restructuring, deregulation) that have translated into efficiency gains. Efficiency gains have been reinforced by a more <b>stable</b> <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework.</b> Lower inflation and fiscal consolidation have led to lower real (and nominal) interest rates, which, in turn, have resulted in a higher sustainable growth. However, the process of real integration could have been even more successful. Spain’s real convergence path with Europe paused from 1975 to 1990. This was partly due to the necessary process of industrial restructuring, deregulation and privatisation. Notwithstanding, the slow pace of reform, in particular in the labour market, with high labour costs leading to persistent unemployment, a real exchange rate appreciation and the impact of two oil shocks prevented Spain from reaping the full benefits of integration. The long-run benefits of monetary integration are clear. However, there are short-term costs. The losses of the exchange rate and of monetary sovereignty require a process of nominal convergence and fiscal consolidation, as well as higher cyclical correlation, for Euro membership to be successful. This should be taken into account for future EU and EMU candidate economies. It implies that, prior to monetary integration, candidates must carry out a process of modernisation and nominal convergence without fixing their exchange rate. This is a slow process, that must be kept in mind by those countries on the accession path now. Finally, the role of Structural Funds has also been crucial. These allow for the construction of public infrastructure vital for private sector productivity and real convergence...|$|E

40|$|African {{countries}} {{are faced with}} the challenge of reducing poverty rates by half on or before the year 2015. This calls for high and sustained economic growth rates. Scaling up of aid to create fiscal space is seen as one way of achieving the high growth rates. But fears have also been expressed that this cannot be realised within tight <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>frameworks.</b> This paper uses an approach of measuring the output gaps in selected African economies to argue whether the calls for macroeconomic policy space are justified or not. Relying on a simple Hodrick-Prescott measure of output potential and output gap, and comparing this with the policy stances are reflected by inflation rates and fiscal balances, the paper provides evidence on where the truth might lie on the issue of scaling-up. The paper concludes that in the first five years post-Millennium Summit, African countries found themselves stuck in a stabilisation trap, with low growth rates that cannot realise the halving of poverty amidst a <b>stable</b> <b>macroeconomic</b> environment. But given that the African economies are characterised by marginal positive output gaps, with a few of them having excess capacity, there is merit in the debate that current macroeconomic policy stances are not consistent with the objective to achieve the first MDG. The implication is that countries—even those with positive output gaps—should consider resetting their thresholds for monetary and fiscal policy targets if they want to accelerate economic growth towards the desired 7 %.
