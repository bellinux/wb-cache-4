500|$|Bathory {{described}} Five Finger Death Punch as [...] "a straight-up {{heavy metal}} band {{with a hint}} of thrash metal — maybe a hint of the Euro stuff in there" [...] and then said, [...] "that's pretty much what we are". Spencer described Five Finger Death Punch as [...] "kind of like stepping on a garden rake while looking at a supermodel. Blissful yet fucking devastating". He then said, [...] "We have an energy and a rhythmical style that's different than what's happening out there. We have songs that grab you and <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and rip your face off. Hooks, balls, melodies and energy — that's us".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film [...] out of 4 stars and said, [...] "The finale conjures up enough awe and solemnity {{to serve as}} an {{appropriate}} finale and a dramatic contrast to the lighthearted (relative) innocence of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone all those magical years ago." [...] Mark Kermode from the BBC said that the film is a [...] "pretty solid and ambitious adaptation of a very complex book", but he criticised the post-converted 3D. Christy Lemire of the Associated Press gave the film [...] out of 4 stars and said [...] "While Deathly Hallows: Part 2 offers long-promised answers, it also dares to pose some eternal questions, and it'll <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> after the final chapter has closed." [...] Richard Roeper, also from the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film an A+ rating and said that [...] "this is a masterful and worthy final chapter in one of the best franchises ever put to film." ...|$|E
500|$|In addition, Tessa {{shares with}} MacLeod the {{consequences}} of his involvement in the Game. She dislikes the Game and would like to escape from it with him, since she fears for his life. According to Vandernoot, Tessa [...] "...always thought that she [...] die before [...] ", but when he told her about the Game during [...] "The Gathering", [...] "she [...] that he [...] be killed", thus she avoided thinking about it. Another consequence of the Game is that Tessa is sometimes exposed to danger from Immortals who want to use her to pressure MacLeod. Despite being captured by Quince in [...] "The Gathering", by the time of [...] "Band of Brothers", she is able to face Grayson: [...] "If you think [...] will stand by, ...you have misjudged him terribly. So you'd better kill me, now, and be done with it." [...] Grayson releases her and calls her [...] "...a remarkable woman, well worth keeping alive." [...] Consequently, Tessa is fully aware of the risks of their relationship, but stays with MacLeod, explaining in [...] "Eyewitness" [...] that [...] "I know the risks I choose to take... I <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> because I want to. I won't run. I'm not the little woman and I'll never be barefoot and pregnant. We all have things to face. This is mine." [...] However, she finds it difficult to deal with her fears when MacLeod leaves to fight another Immortal.|$|E

500|$|Raja Sen of Rediff {{gave the}} film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Rockstar is a simple, unspectacular tale, {{sometimes}} even predictable, but director Imtiaz Ali masterfully weaves in details that draw us in." [...] Aniruddha Guha of DNA too gave the film 4 out of 5 {{saying that the}} film was [...] "like an effective crescendo that leaves you wanting more." [...] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India also gave the film 4 out of 5 and stated that [...] "The highpoint of Rockstar is it's high tension, high-on-passion romance between two unlikely people". Sukanya Verma of Rediff rated it 3.5 stars out of 5 and said, [...] "Rockstar is flawed but fabulous." [...] Mayank Shekhar of Hindustan Times also gave a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and noted [...] "The canvas is wide like early Sanjay Leela Bhansali's; bird's view of the stunning bridge is very Mani Ratnam; witty, earthy dialogues are so Vishal Bhardwaj. Director Imitiaz Ali manages to retain a personal, auteur's touch in a genre vastly commercial, mainstream. This is a rare feat." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and said [...] "On the whole, Rockstar does {{not live up to}} the confidence and expectations from the otherwise very skilled and accomplished film-maker Imtiaz Ali." [...] Hrithik Sharma of El Viaje Reviews included it into his select list of Bollywood classics and says that [...] "Rockstar is a unique cocktail of 50% drama, 40% romance and 10% comedy. What stands out is the music by A. R. Rahman. Each song in the film is a masterpiece and fits very well into the plot. Cinematography is realistic but prepossessing indeed. The film gets a 10 on 10 in this department. There are certain scenes in the film that may seem unrelated to the plot but those would be the scenes that would <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> longer." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN also gave 3 stars out of 5, commenting [...] "Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar is a far-from-perfect film, but it has honesty and depth, which is mostly missing in Hindi movies today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviewer David Ellis, naming Curious Incident an [...] "ambitious and {{innovative}} novel," [...] wrote that Haddon [...] "manages {{to avoid the}} opposing pitfalls of either offending people with autism and their families or turning Christopher into an object of pity. Instead of becoming {{the focus of the}} plot, the autism enhances it. The unemotional descriptions amplify many moments of observational comedy, and misfortunes are made extremely poignantly." [...] He concludes that Christopher's story is [...] "far more enjoyable and likely to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> for far longer than any medical textbook." ...|$|E
