50|$|An {{operating}} reserve is a generator that can quickly be dispatched {{to ensure that}} there is sufficient energy generation to meet load. <b>Spinning</b> <b>reserves</b> are generators that are already online and can rapidly increase their power output to meet fast changes in demand. <b>Spinning</b> <b>reserves</b> are required because demand can vary on short timescales and rapid response is needed.

These fluctuations may be suitable for hybrid operation.

Low cost generation capacity (baseload) such as nuclear can take many hours to [...] start, meaning a surplus in times of low demand, whereas high cost but flexible generating capacity (such as gas turbines) must be kept available to respond at a moment's notice (<b>spinning</b> <b>reserve)</b> to peak demand, perhaps being used for a few minutes per day, which is very expensive.|$|E

Generation companies (GenCos) can choose their bid parameters with no restrictions for both energy and <b>spinning</b> <b>reserves.</b> The strategic behavior of generators is formulated as a multi-leader single-follower game. Each GenCo is modeled as a leader, while the central market operator running a cost minimization process is the sole follower. An ac model is considered to represent the transmission system.

40|$|Ancillary {{services}} {{are defined as}} all those activities on the interconnected grid {{that are necessary to}} support the transmission of power while maintaining reliable operation and ensuring the required degree of quality and safety. There are several activities of the operator that come under the preview of ancillary services. The definitions of some services and distinctions between some of them are often unclear. This thesis attempts to examine three of the most important ancillary services provided by the independent system operator in a deregulated power system, that of maintaining the system voltage profile within acceptable limits, the system frequency around the nominal value and enough of <b>spinning</b> <b>reserves</b> to maintain the system security.

30|$|Constraints (5)–(7) {{impose the}} {{capacity}} {{constraints on the}} conventional generators. Note that when a generator is offline (i.e., u_i,t = 0) it is restricted to providing zero generation and <b>spinning</b> <b>reserves</b> but can provide nonspinning reserves. Otherwise, if a generator is online, it can provide any combination of energy and reserves, {{so long as the}} maximum generation level is not violated. Constraints (8) and (9) impose the reserve-capability restrictions on the conventional generators. A conventional generator can only provide <b>spinning</b> <b>reserves</b> in a given hour if it is online during that hour (hence, the right-hand sides of constraints (8) have u_i,t terms). Generators that are qualified to provide nonspinning reserves can provide them when offline. Constraints (10) and (11) impose the ramping restrictions. As with generator upper-capacity constraints (6) and (7), ramp-up constraints (11) consider energy and reserves provided by generators in each hour. Constraints (12) and (13) impose the minimum up- and down-time restrictions when a generator is started up- or shutdown. Constraints (14) impose the state-transition logic by defining the values of the s_i,t and h_i,t variables in terms of changes in the u_i,t variables. Constraints (15) force the state variables to take on binary values. Constraints (16) impose the limits on wind generation.|$|R

Some potential benefits that transactive energy is expected to deliver include: (a) it optimizes the use of distributed energy resources; (b) it improves power system efficiency and reliability; (c) it reduces the requirements for capacities and <b>spinning</b> <b>reserves</b> to address generation/load uncertainties; (d) it creates a fair and transparent platform that allows all resources to transact.|$|R

These services generally include, frequency control, <b>spinning</b> <b>reserves</b> and operating reserves. Traditionally ancillary services have been provided by generators, however, the integration of intermittent generation and the development of smart grid technologies have prompted a shift in the equipment {{that can be used to}} provide ancillary services.|$|R

5000|$|Name plate/declared {{capacity}} of the many coal fired plants owned by IPPs are overrated above the actual maximum continuous rating (MCR) capacity. The reason for overrating the capacity is to over-invoice the plant cost. These plants operate 15 to 10% below their declared capacity on daily basis and operate rarely at declared capacity. Thus these units are not effectively contributing to the on line <b>spinning</b> <b>reserves</b> to maintain power system / grid stabilization. This is also due to reason that point of connection charges are levied in India based on energy exported instead of MCR capacity as applicable for national grid in UK.|$|R
