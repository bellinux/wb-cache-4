40|$|From the Introduction. The present {{contribution}} {{is an attempt}} to raise awareness between the 'trenches' by juxtaposing the two approaches to subsidiarity. Subsequently, I shall set out why, in economics, subsidiarity is embraced as a key principle in the design and working of the Union and how a functional <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test</b> can be derived from this thinking. Throughout the paper, a range of illustrations and examples is provided in an attempt to show the practical applicability of a <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test.</b> This does not mean, of course, that the application of the test can automatically "solve" all debates on whether subsidiarity is (not) violated. What it does mean, however, is that a careful methodology can be a significant help to e. g. national parliaments and the Brussels circuit, in particular, to discourage careless politicisation as much as possible and to render assessments of subsidiarity comparable throughout the Union. The latter virtue should be of interest to national parliaments in cooperating, within just six weeks, about a common stance {{in the case of a}} suspected violation of the principle. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 gives a flavour of very different approaches and appreciation of the subsidiarity principle in European law and in the economics of multi-tier government. Section 3 elaborates on the economics of multi-tier government as a special instance of cost / benefit analysis of (de) centralisation in the three public economic functions of any government system. This culminates in a five-steps <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test</b> and a brief discussion about its proper and improper application. Section 4 applies the test in a non-technical fashion to a range of issues of the "efficiency function" (i. e. allocation and markets) of the EU. After showing that the functional logic of subsidiarity may require liberalisation to be accompanied by various degrees of centralisation, a number of fairly detailed illustrations of how to deal with subsidiarity in the EU is provided. One illustration is about how the subsidiarity logic is misused by protagonists (labour in the internal market). A slightly different but frequently encountered aspect consists in the refusal to recognize that the EU (that is, some form of centralisation) offers a better solution than 25 national ones. A third range of issues, where the functional logic of subsidiarity could be useful, emerges when the boundaries of national competences are shifting due to more intense cross-border flows and developments. Other subsections are devoted to Union public goods and to the question whether the <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test</b> might trace instances of EU decentralisation: a partial or complete shift of a policy or regulation to Member States. The paper refrains from an analysis of the application of the <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test</b> to the other two public functions, namely, equity and macro-economic stabilisation. 2 Section 5 argues that the use of a well-developed methodology of a functional <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test</b> would be most useful for the national parliaments and even more so for their cooperation in case of a suspected violation of subsidiarity. Section 6 concludes...|$|E

Although COSAC is primarily technical, it has been started to become more political especially since the Lisbon Treaty.

Therefore the substantial part notion acts as a boundary or <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test,</b> determining whether the alleged abuse falls under Article 82 or member state law. This paper contends that two different and potentially competing substantial part tests have been legally sanctioned, namely the territorial test and the economic relativism approach.

It therefore develops a <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test</b> to assess whether current rationales still prove sufficient to justify policy intervention in this area. The paper sheds light on how to improve the effectiveness of EU action by enriching it by the use of coordinated fiscal policy for research funding. This will constitute an incentive to genuine bottom-up research, development and innovation (R&D&I) and a stimulus to local investments in innovation.

40|$|In the EU circuit (especially the European Parliament, the Council and Coreper) {{as well as}} in {{national}} parliaments of the EU Member States, one observes a powerful tendency to regard 'subsidiarity' as a 'political' issue. Moreover, subsidiarity is frequently seen as a one-way street : powers going 'back to' Member States. Both interpretations are at least partly flawed and less than helpful when looking for practical ways to deal with subsidiarity at both EU and Member states' levels. The present paper shows that subsidiarity as a principle is profoundly 'functional' in nature and, hence, is and must be a two-way principle. A functional <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test</b> is developed and its application is illustrated for a range of policy issues in the internal market in its widest sense, for equity and for macro-economic stabilisation questions in European integration. Misapplications of 'subsidiarity' are also demonstrated. For a good understanding, subsidiarity being a functional, two-way principle neither means that elected politicians should not have the final (political!) say (for which they are accountable), nor that subsidiarity tests, even if properly conducted, cannot and will not be politicised once the results enter the policy debate. Such politicisation forms a natural run-up to the decision-making by those elected for it. But the quality and reasoning of the test as well as structuring the information in a logical sequence (in accordance with the current protocol and with the one in the constitutional treaty) is likely to be directly helpful for decisionmakers, confronted with complicated and often specialised proposals. EU debates and decision-making is therefore best served by separating the functional <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test</b> (prepared by independent professionals) from the final political decision itself. If the test were accepted Union-wide, it would also assist national parliaments in conducting comparable tests in a relatively short period, as the basis for possible joint action (as suggested by the constitutional treaty). The core of the paper explains how the test is formulated and applied. A functional approach to subsidiarity in the framework of European representative democracy seeks to find the optimal assignment of regulatory or policy competences to the various tiers of government. In the final analysis, this is about structures facilitating the highest possible welfare in the Union, in the fundamental sense that preferences and needs are best satisfied. What is required for such an analysis is no less than a systematic cost/benefit framework to assess the (de) merits of (de) centralisation in the EU...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{contends that}} the Lisbon {{strategy}} for a reformed economic, social and environmental governance is bedevilled by ambiguities operating at different levels. First, it has been unclear to what extent issues of social governance remain central to the Lisbon goals. Second, even if Lisbon has a social dimension, there are competing organising frameworks which may argue for {{a greater or lesser}} independent identity to that social dimension. Third, the use of the open method of co-ordination has avoided a deeper specification of the need for EU intervention in social policy: indeed, there has generally been a failure to distinguish between competing rationales for policy co-ordination not all of which may survive the application of a <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test.</b> Fourth, attempts to streamline and reform the social OMC processes have not resolved these ambiguities and indeed have further highlighted a tension between a desire to focus on key social messages to drive co-ordination and a governance architecture which supports a much more open, selective and elective process of (potential) policy learning across states. Fifthly, the recent consultation on ‘active inclusion’ will be an important test for the future social co-ordination architecture, involving choices between quite different interpretations of the role of co-ordination in EU social governance. Finally, the paper suggests that one means of resolving the ambiguities of OMC is to place much less emphasis upon OMC as a means of ‘governing’ social inclusion and instead to focus on structures through which information gathering and monitoring might be harnessed to a rather older normative preoccupation, namely, the ‘accountability’ of governments...|$|E
40|$|In {{the vast}} {{domain of the}} {{internal}} market, ‘regulation’ is EU’s core business. Therefore, a good appreciation of European economic integration requires a sound analytical economic perspective of EU regulation. Since the Single European Act, economists have gradually improved the economic analysis of EU regulation. EU policy-makers began to accept cost/benefit analysis with the Maastricht treaty and nowadays the rigorous logic of Better Regulation and regulatory impact analysis has become routine in the EU circuit, although less with the EU legislator (EP and Council). The present BEEP Briefing provides an accessible survey {{of the state of}} the art of the evidence-based, economic approach to EU Single Market regulation. This approach puts the <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test,</b> proportionality and necessity on a firmer analytical footing and offers a healthy discipline of the precautionary principle. The acceptance of economic, evidence-based regulatory logic has caused a change of mind-sets in the European Commission: EU regulation is now routinely discussed in terms of incentives, asymmetries of information, multiple policy options (instead of going for a single one only), market-based instruments, quantification of benefits and costs, red-tape alerts and cost-effectiveness. Last but not least, this also matters for national regulation. Given an ever deeper and wider internal market than two decades ago, not to speak of the Eurozone, the regulatory autonomy of Member States has to be balanced against the possible consequences of undermining or preventing the ‘proper functioning’ of the internal market. The key words here are pro-competitive reforms and ‘diversity’’, based on distinct national preferences, yet minimizing costly ‘regulatory heterogeneity’ arising from decentralized decision-making but without being rooted in genuine differences in preferences...|$|E
40|$|What is ‘the’ EU {{internal}} market, as economists see it? The present BEER paper {{attempts to}} survey and help readers understand various ‘economic’ {{approaches to the}} internal market idea. The paper starts with a conceptual discussion of what ‘the’ internal market is (in an economic perspective). Six different economic meanings of the internal market are presented, with the sixth one being the economic benchmark in an ideal setting. Subsequently, the question is asked what the internal market (i. e. its proper functioning) is good for. Put differently, the internal market in the EU Treaty is a means, but a means to what? Beyond the typical economic growth objectives of the Rome Treaty (still valid today, with some qualifications), other Treaty objectives have emerged. Economists typically think in means-end relationships and the instrumental role of the internal market for Treaty objectives is far from clear. The ‘new’ Commission internal market strategy of 2007 proposes a more goal-oriented internal market policy. Such a vision is more selective in picking intermediate objectives to which ‘the’ internal market should be instrumental, but it risks to ignore the major deficits in today’s internal market: services and labour! The means-end relationships get even more problematic once one begins to scrutinise all the socio-economic objectives of the current (Amsterdam/Nice) Treaty or still other intermediate objectives. The internal market (explicitly including the relevant common regulation) then becomes a ‘jack of all trades’ for the environment, {{a high level of}} social protection, innovation or ‘Social Europe’. These means/ends relationships often are ill-specified. The final section considers the future of the internal market, by distinguishing three strategies: incremental strategies (including the new internal market strategy of November 2007); the internal market as the core of the Economic Union serving the ‘proper functioning of the monetary union’; and deepening and widening of the internal market as justified by the functional <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test.</b> Even though the latter two would seem to be preferable from an economic point of view, they currently lack political legitimacy and are therefore unlikely to be pursued in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Federal {{governments and}} unions of states face the {{fundamental}} task of allocating {{the creation and}} enforcement of policy to either federal (central) government or local governments. Within the European Union, subsidiarity is intended to prescribe the allocation of competences at the central (European Union) or local (member states) level and to ‘balance’ the European Union's powers at the central level with the member states' powers at the local level. Prior to recognition of the subsidiarity principle, the distribution of powers between the Community and the member states represented {{one of the most}} delicate and contentious political issues in the European Union. Since the creation of the European Economic Community in 1958, member states’ political actors were critical of what they perceived to be an irreversible process of centralization of competences at the Community level. Although in theory, the transfer of competences from member states to the Community could only take place through conferral within the limits of the competences conferred by the member states to attain the Community objectives set out in Articles 2 and 3 of the 1958 Treaty of Rome (i. e., the creation of a common market and the harmonization of related policies), competences were often reallocated outside the original scope as a result of political considerations. Everling (1997) and Carbonara, Luppi and Parisi (2009) provide a number of examples of reallocation of competences that were hardly warranted by the original treaty provisions, ranging from aids or levies to regulation of product quality and special monetary systems. Political pressures towards centralization found little constraints from within the Community laws and procedures. The 1986 Single European Act expanded the scope of the Community action to new fields (such as research, finance, economic convergence, social policy and environment) and raised the member states’ concern towards new waves of centralization. Several intergovernmental conferences addressed these concerns and eventually laid the foundations for the Maastricht Treaty, redefining the boundaries of the enlarged political, economic and monetary union. The member states’ concerns were addressed in these intergovernmental conferences with a discussion of possible rules that could provide a more effective constraint to new centralization proposals. Among these rules, subsidiarity played an important role as a potential constraint against unwarranted centralization. The subsidiarity principle was formally adopted in 1992 by the Treaty of the European Union (Treaty of Maastricht, signed on 7 February 1992, entered into force on 1 November 1993). The December 1992 Edinburgh summit further stressed the critical role of subsidiarity, requiring all institutions of the Union to use a test of subsidiarity as a condition precedent to their policy action, giving the European Court of Justice the role of guidance and adjudication to ensure compliance with subsidiarity. The subsidiarity principle is currently included in Article 5 of the consolidated version of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, which states that “The Community shall act within the limits of the powers conferred upon it by this Treaty and of the objectives assigned to it therein. In areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community. Any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Treaty. ” The subsidiarity principle also plays a prominent role in the draft of the proposed European Constitution, under Article 9 which states that the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality govern the use of Union competences. Paragraph 3 of Article 9 further specifies that “under the principle of subsidiarity, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence the Union shall act only if and insofar as the objectives of the intended action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states, either at central level or at regional and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level. ” Despite the prominence of subsidiarity in the European constitutional framework, the European Union struggled with the interpretation and implementation of this principle. At the 1992 Edinburgh Summit, the European Council provided some clarification of the meaning and modes of application of subsidiarity, specifying that action at the central level should be carried out only upon evidence of clear benefits of scale or effectiveness compared to the independent action of member states. In that context, the Council further stressed that the European Union's centralization decisions should be supported by qualitative or quantitative analyses showing the comparative advantage of the Union in carrying out specified competences (Marquardt, 1994). As pointed out by Estella (2002, p. 103), Provision 3 of the Protocol 30 annexed to the European Union Treaty reinforced the legal dimension and binding force of the subsidiarity principle as a dynamic principle regulating the exercise of competences already attributed to the Community, allowing action to be taken or restricted according to the evolution of circumstances. The reference to cost-benefit analysis and to the dynamic nature of subsidiarity created more questions than answers. Despite various attempts to clarify the meaning of comparative advantage in the context of subsidiarity, the implementation of the subsidiarity principle remains, obscure and in need of formal guidelines in the opinion of both scholars and policymakers. As van den Bergh (1997) points out, the existing legal guidelines lack formalization and leave skeptism regarding the subsidiarity test's real utility in providing an effective constraint to centralization. Absent a formalization of the <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test,</b> the European Court of Justice faces unavoidably difficulties in assessing the qualitative and qualitative merits of a case on the ground of subsidiarity in a substantive judgment. In the present study, we will survey the existing economic models of subsidiarity and examine {{the extent to which these}} formalizations may provide a valuable guidance for the implementation of the <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test</b> and for the understanding of the limits of subsidiarity as a principled constraint to centralization...|$|E
40|$|This thesis scrutinizes the {{proportionality}} {{and describes}} the subsidiarity of proposals for security breach notification laws (hereafter: SBNLs) in the European Union. An SBNL obliges that a security breach within a company or government must be notified to affected customers and a supervisory authority. A law stands the proportionality test if {{the requirements of}} effectiveness and necessity are met. Effectiveness {{means that there is}} a causal relationship between the measure and the aim pursued. Necessity means that no less restrictive policy options are available that achieve the same aims. The closely linked <b>subsidiarity</b> <b>test</b> assesses the necessity of the European Union approach: the question whether the aims of the SBNL and cybersecurity cannot be achieved sufficiently by the Member States individually. Subsidiarity is to a great extent a political question and consequently described more limitedly. Why these tests? Proportionality and subsidiarity are fundamental principles of EU law. They demand the European legislature not to go beyond what is necessary to attain the objectives in the Treaties and to only adopt measures if a European Union approach has added value. The European Court of Justice scrutinizes whether European legislation is in accordance with these principles. The laws that have been assessed are Article 31 of the proposed Data Protection Regulation (hereafter: PDPR) and Article 14 of the proposed Cybersecurity Directive (hereafter: PCD). Article 31 PDPR concerns a single uniform personal data breach notification obligation. A personal data breach entails the unauthorized access to and/or theft of personal data. Article 14 PCD concerns the harmonization of national (significant) loss of integrity breach notification obligations. A loss of integrity concerns the loss of control over computer systems. A personal data breach always entails a loss of integrity, but a loss of integrity can also occur without the loss of personal data. The aim of the SBNL in the PDPR is “to ensure that individuals are in control of their personal data and trust the digital environment” in order to “increase the effectiveness of the fundamental right to data protection”. The aim of the SBNL in the PCD is: “to create a culture of risk management and improve the sharing of information between the private and public sectors. ” The subsidiarity question covers cybersecurity in general and SBNLs in particular. The Commission argues that a European cybersecurity approach is necessary because of the cross border aspect of the Internet, the necessity of a uniform secure Internet for the Single Market and the protection of fundamental rights. Indeed, there is European cybersecurity legislation and a European cybersecurity policy framework. Regarding the PDPR and the PCD in particular, the Commission argues {{that there is a need}} to harmonize national initiatives in order to create a level playing field, legal certainty and lower administrative burdens for companies to notify. A literature review in this thesis shows that the United States aims to replace a state level SBNLs by a federal SBNL. The obligation to comply simultaneously with multiple SBNLs caused significant administrative burdens for companies. This strengthens the conception that SBNLs can better be achieved at a European level, although this remains a political consideration. From an apolitical point of view, this thesis did not find a convincing argument about the inappropriateness of a European approach regarding cybersecurity and SBNLs. The proportionality test contains two elements. The first element of the proportionality test, the effectiveness test, is performed more extensively in this thesis than the Commission did in its impact assessment of both the PDPR and the PCD. Legal scholars and the European legislator, usually assess the first aspect of proportionality limitedly. In the PDPR and PCD, the Commission did not mention in what way the SBNL is suitable to achieve the aim “to ensure that individuals are in control of their personal data and thrust in the digital environment” and “to create a culture of risk management and improvement of information sharing between private and public parties”. This is a deficiency in the analysis of legislation. This thesis challenges the aforementioned assumption that determination of causality is straightforward. This is done by a more substantive assessment of the proportionality test. This thesis contributes an empirical study from a security economics perspective, in order to substantively review (the complexity of) effects of SBNLs. Do the (expected) effects of SBNLs match the aims it should attain according to the European proposals? And are these effects desirable? Legal impact assessments can benefit from this perspective, because knowledge about the effectiveness of the law will be enhanced. To structure the empirical study, a first and second order effect of SBNLs have been distinguished. The first order effect is the effect of (characteristics of) SBNLs on the amount of breach notifications. Generating notifications is not one of the final aims of the proposed legislation, but a means to achieve the second order effect. The second order effect includes the positive and negative effects of the law on society. A literature review is conducted to provide an overview of what is already known concerning those two effects. The quantitative analysis systematically assesses the first order effect of American SBNLs by a longitudinal dataset containing security breach notifications. The subsequent qualitative analysis reviews the perception of Dutch security experts and managers regarding the first and second order effect and outcomes of the quantitative analysis. The results can substantiate the first element of the Commissions’ proportionality test of European SBNLs: This study proves the first order effect empirically by means of analyzing American data. The laws have an effect on the amount of breach notifications. The effect is relatively large: a notification increase of at least 50 % can be attributed to the law, by a fixed effects regression analyzing differences in breach notification before and after the introduction of the law. The database is partly constructed by underlying sources that only register officially notified breaches, which can explain this high relative increase. From an absolute perspective, the effect is minor: less than 0. 05 % of the companies notified a security breach in America in the eight-year period that was researched. To compare: a recent study in the United Kingdom published that 88 % of the companies surveyed had experienced data theft in 2009. The low absolute number of breaches could be explained by the incompleteness of the dataset, high compliance costs for a company due to reputation damage and unawareness of breaches. The introduction of the law thus has a structural first order effect, at least in the database of known security breaches. It is however ambiguous which aspects of the law cause this effect. Literature review and qualitative analysis showed that enforced sanctions generate compliance with the law and that reputation damage is a major driver for non-compliance. Confidential treatment of the notification and benefits from information sharing about security breaches are perceived as minor incentives for compliance. The quantitative analysis only confirmed that some American laws qualified as strict by American Attorneys cause an increase in notifications, but it is ambiguous what exactly makes these laws strict. The literature review and the qualitative study demonstrated several positive second order effects perceived in literature and by security managers and experts, such as increased investments in security, fostered cooperation between companies (literature only), increased awareness of consumers of security breaches and faster risk mitigation. The first two effects match with the aim of the PCD to 1.) create a culture of risk management and 2.) enhance information exchange between the private and public sectors respectively. The last two effects correspond with the aim of the PDPR to enhance personal data control of individuals. However, the positive effects can be nuanced. The security managers interviewed already shared security information with competitors, and did not see an incentive for cooperation with the government following from a security breach notification, because they did not value the government as a center of expertise. Moreover, a security expert challenged the effect of increased investments in security because the law provides an incentive to notify, not to improve security practices. Accepting the ‘risk’ of a notification might be less expensive than improving security practices in order to avoid notifications. This is however not confirmed in literature review or by other qualitative analysis, which implicates that the risk of not providing incentives to improve security practices at all must be perceived as low. Lastly, an increased number of security breach notifications might result in an overload of information that could also result in disinterest and a notification fatigue instead of enhanced awareness and risk mitigation. This overload is not a big treat given the current low amount of notified security breaches. For instance, in America, about 600 million records were breached in the eight-year period observed. This would entail that, on average, an American citizen would be notified twice in eight year. Hence, the second order effects in literature and qualitative analysis, although they are perceptions that can be nuanced, do match the objectives pursued in legislation. But, the objectives are vaguely defined and while their attainment could constitute effectiveness in the legal sense, the question remains what makes an SBNL effective and when an SBNL is effective. Moreover, there are also additional negative effects associated with SBNL in literature and qualitative analysis, such as reputational costs and maintenance costs. The second element of the proportionality test concerns the question whether there are less restrictive equally effective measures available. The SBNL can restrict companies, because it infringes the fundamental freedom to conduct a business by imposing administrative, compliance- and reputational costs. This study offers two observations concerning this infringement. First, the freedom to conduct business is more infringed than the Commission states. The cost assessment of the Commission only included the costs of making a notification, which are estimated between 125 euro and 20000 euro per notification. But, literature and qualitative analysis showed that there are costs that the Commission did not take into account, such as the reputation damage incurred (estimations up to 2 % of a company’s turnover) and the costs of processing and enforcement of breach notifications. The cost estimation of the Commission thus is undervalued compared with the total societal costs of an SBNL. Second, the coexistence of the PDPR and the PCD unnecessarily infringes the freedom to provide a business as it imposes unnecessary costs for companies. In many cases, a breach thus should be notified twice to both the European supervisory authority and to the competent national authority, because the scope of personal data loss and loss of integrity overlap. Second, the proposals are regulated by a different legal instrument and emit different signals. The confidential treatment in the PCD will not function properly if simultaneously companies are forced to publicly disclose the same information in the PDPR. To conclude, the fuzziness of the aims and the complexity of measuring effects hamper the determination of a reasonable expectation of causality between the measure and the aims pursued. The Commission sets aims that are fuzzy and hard to measure, and does not specify how these goals will be achieved through the adoptions of SBNLs. Likewise, the empirical measurement of effects in part ? showed that it is complex to pinpoint effects of SBNLs. Moreover, the Commission undervalued societal costs and adverse effects. In my view, in the current situation, a reasonable expectation of effectiveness is not demonstrated sufficiently. In the theoretically desired situation, the goals are clear and measurable. The law is effective because the measurable aims are achieved by the measure. But, still, effectiveness is not simply attaining aims. Even if the causal relation between the measure and its aims can be proved in a narrow sense, the question remains whether the achievement of these aims is effective. From a security economics perspective, it can be argued that the law is effective if the revenues of positive effects are higher than the societal costs of negative effects. This requires an accurate empirical measurement of these effects, initiated in part ?, and a quantification of these effects. Unfortunately, this approach towards effectiveness does not cover non-economic, non-measurable aims such as the protection of fundamental rights. The protection of fundamental rights is not always ‘efficient’ and can certainly not always be quantified, but European legislation must remain within the boundaries of fundamental rights. Moreover, the complexity of the legal interferences in the field of cybersecurity makes it impossible to provide an exhaustive balance sheet of all (expected) effects. A security economics perspective would not be the perfect means to define effectiveness, because some aims are not measurable and expected effects are complex. Both a legal and an economic approach do not provide an optimal outcome for the definition of ‘effectiveness’. There is no uniformity of what makes a law effective. Thus, still the effectiveness question remains. What is needed to determine the effectiveness of SBNLs? Who may decide when a law is effective? In a democracy, we all should decide. More concrete: the European Commission, Parliament and Council state ex ante in the ordinary legislative procedure the aims of the law. The European Court of Justice decides ex post whether the law is effective. Thus, effectiveness in redefined, as legal and economic approaches towards effectiveness are troublesome. This definition must be regarded as a starting point for further research on interpreting effectiveness of the law. "Effectiveness is the causality between a legislation and its aims defined by a democratic decision making process where as much information as possible about (potential) positive and negative effects is provided. " Hence, taking this definition into account, improving information about potential positive and negative effects is the key tool to enhance effectiveness of the law and correctly assess its necessity. The executed empirical analysis in this thesis has provided knowledge about the effects of SBNLs that can be used by the Commission. Increased availability of information about societal impact (expectations) enhances decision making of the legislature ex ante and the scrutiny of the Court ex post that determine the proportionality of cybersecurity laws. The Commission, which has the power of initiative, should invest to provide this information. To conclude, additional information about effects of legislation on society will improve the quality of draft legislation and the judicial decision about proportionality. For example, information about the adverse reputation damage on companies, demonstrated in this thesis, will play a vital role when judging about the infringement on the freedom to conduct business. Additional information about effects will not be decisive in a judicial decision, since also non measurable effects need to be balanced and (expected) effects have a certain margin of error. The proportionality test as such must be seen in relation to these inherent flaws within measuring effectiveness of the law on society. Often, causality between the measure and the aim can and will not be ‘proven’ scientifically by the legislature and the Court. Nevertheless, the proportionality principle has been a corner stone of European Law to analyze the effectiveness and necessity of legislation. Further enhancement of the execution of this principle by improving information about societal effects increases the democratic legitimacy of European Union law. Therefore, this thesis recommends the European Commission to enhance information about effects. This can be done to improve the measurement of (the expectation of) effects before and after the adoption of the law. These recommendations can be used for improving European laws in general and the PDPR and PCD in particular. Before the adoption of the law, a reasonable expectation of effectiveness should be provided by the Commission. This entails the operationalization of measurable aims, the separation of non-measurable aims and a substantiated expectation of causality between the law and the aims. This thesis recommends to operationalize aims that are in essence measurable. For instance, the perception of personal data control by European citizens can be measured. Another option is to use a proxy. The amount of personal data security breaches serves as a proxy for the aim of personal data control. Fundamental rights that are associated with the aims of the legislation, such as the freedom of speech and the freedom of expression, have an intrinsic value, which cannot be operationalized. These important non measurable aims should be included separately as informative input for a democratic legislative decision making process. An effective consideration of the democratic decision making process necessitates an extensive overview of potential negative effects as well. To provide a reasonable expectation of effectiveness, an extensive study of the expected effects is recommended by means of academic literature, secondary available comparative (quantitative) analysis and expert interviews. This threefold approach, adhered in this thesis, has enhanced the knowledge about expected effects and requires further development and a wider application. As a result, a conceptual framework clarifies the effects to enhance the decision maker’s information. Before the introduction of the law, the increased information about expected positive and negative effects and non-measurable aims allows for a more enhanced discussion about the desirability of the legislation. Ideally, the expected effects of the measurable part of the legislation will be quantified in order to clarify and structure the discussion about the desirability of the law. Consequently, the discussion solely concerns normative choices about the balance between non quantifiable effects with the sum of the measurable positive effects and negative effects. After the introduction of the law, the central registration of breach notifications, surveys about the perception of the effectiveness of the law and the registration of relevant proxies are key tools to empirically measure effectiveness.
