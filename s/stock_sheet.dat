To do this polygons {{are placed in}} rows within bins using a metaheuristic algorithm (simulated annealing) and by utilising the No Fit Polygon. We show that simulated annealing out performs hill climbing. The nesting algorithm is described in detail, along with various aspects that have been incorporated {{in order to improve}} the efficiency of the algorithm whilst maintaining solution quality. Computational results are given 1. Introduction In the nesting problem pieces must be placed onto larger shape(s) (which we will refer to as <b>stock</b> <b>sheets).</b> In doing so two constraints must not be violated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for solving a new real problem in cutting and packing. At its core is an innovative mixed integer programme model that places irregular pieces and defines guillotine cuts. The two-dimensional irregular shape bin packing problem with guillotine constraints arises {{in the glass}} cutting industry, for example, the cutting of glass for conservatories. Almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal {{to the edges of}} the <b>stock</b> <b>sheet</b> and a maximum of two angles of rotation are permitted. The literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i. e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width <b>stock</b> <b>sheet,</b> and does not consider guillotine cuts. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that are not always orthogonal to the edges of the <b>stock</b> <b>sheet,</b> and allocating pieces to bins. To our knowledge only one other recent paper tackles this problem. We present a hybrid algorithm that is a constructive heuristic that determines the relative position of pieces in the bin and guillotine constraints via a mixed integer programme model. We investigate two approaches for allocating guillotine cuts {{at the same time as}} determining the placement of the piece, and a two phase approach that delays the allocation of cuts to provide flexibility in space usage. Finally we describe an improvement procedure that is applied to each bin before it is closed. This approach improves on the results of the only other publication on this problem, and gives competitive results for the classic rectangle bin packing problem with guillotine constraint...|$|E

According to the definition of guillotine cutting, it seems that the waste in this form of problem is {{greater than or equal to}} that in the non-guillotine form, as the guillotine cut imposes a limitation and, as we know, as the limitations increase, if the solution space does not shrink, at best, it will be constant and not grow.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{two-dimensional}} irregular packing problem with multiple homogeneous bins (2 DIBPP). The literature on irregular shaped packing problems {{is dominated by}} the single <b>stock</b> <b>sheet</b> strip packing problem. However, in reality manufacturers are cutting orders over multi-stock sheets. Despite its greater relevance, {{there are only a few}} papers that tackle this problem in the literature. A multi-stock sheet problem has two decision components; the allocation of pieces to stock sheets and the layout design for each <b>stock</b> <b>sheet.</b> In this paper, we propose a heuristic method that addresses both the allocation and placement problems together based on the Jostle algorithm. Jostle was first applied to strip packing. In order to apply Jostle to the bin packing problem we modify the placement heuristic. In addition we improve the search capability by introducing a diversification mechanism into the approach. Furthermore, the paper presents alternative strategies for handling rotation of pieces, which includes a restricted set of angles and unrestricted rotation. Very few authors permit unrestricted rotation of pieces, despite this being a feature of many problems where the material is homogeneous. Finally, we investigate alternative placement criteria and show that the most commonly applied bottom left criteria does not perform as well as other options. The paper evaluates performance of each algorithm using different sets of instances considering convex and non-convex shapes. Findings of this study reveal that the proposed algorithms can be applied to different variants of the problem and generate significantly better results...|$|E
40|$|In various industries, {{manufacturers}} must cut rectangular {{items from}} <b>stock</b> <b>sheets.</b> In the actual setting, <b>stock</b> <b>sheets</b> inevitably contain some defects, and manufacturers have to avoid cutting the products which contain the defects (i. e., TFT–LCD industry, e-paper); therefore, the two-dimensional bin packing problems with defect (2 DBPPWD) emerges. However, no effective method for solving 2 DBPPWD {{in the current}} literature has been developed. To address the research gaps and industrial requirements, this study proposes an effective approach that integrates ant colony optimization with the flawless corner space placement algorithm to solve 2 DBPPWD. Finally, we compare the proposed approach with the traditional approach (genetic algorithm integrated with bottom–left placement) to solve C 21 (Hopper &Turton, 2001) and N 13 (Burke et al., 2004) problems. Computational results demonstrate that our proposed approach can solve 2 DBPPWD effectively and significantly outperform those of current approaches.

Then, a greedy strategy is used to search a better solution. At last, a simulated annealing algorithm is introduced to jump out of the local optimal trap of the greedy strategy, to find a further improved solution.

40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} strip packing problem {{occurs in}} {{industries such as}} metal, wood, glass, paper, and textiles.

The contribution of this paper is to present a much simpler but equally competitive iterative packing methodology based on squeaky wheel optimisation. After each complete packing (iteration), a penalty is applied to pieces that directly decreased the solution quality. These penalties inform the packing in the next iteration, so that the offending pieces are packed earlier. This methodology is deterministic and very easy to implement, and can obtain some best results on benchmark instances from the literature...|$|E
