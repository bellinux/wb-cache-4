The Snow Queen is later revealed to Elsa's aunt and one of Emma's foster mothers; she plans on making them her new sisters, despite their obvious hatred of her. The Snow Queen enacts the spell of Shattered Sight to make everyone kill each other; however, she is given a letter written by Elsa and Anna's mother that shows how much she was loved. Seeing <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>herself</b> become a monster, the Snow Queen ends the spell by killing herself. At the same time, Mr. Gold plots to free himself of the Dark One dagger's control by crushing Hook's heart in a ceremony; however, Belle uses the dagger to force Gold to leave Storybrooke. Gold reunites the Queens of Darkness (Ursula, Cruella De Vil and Maleficent) to find the Author responsible for writing their stories and force him to give them happy endings. Emma also learns that her old friend Lily is Maleficent's daughter, helping the two reunite. Allying with the Author, Mr. Gold traps everyone in a new story called Heroes and Villains, where the roles are reversed. Henry frees everyone, becoming the new Author in the process. Things get worse as the darkness in Gold escapes, being revealed to be the true Dark One. To save Regina from becoming possessed by it, Emma forces the Darkness to take her instead.|$|E
500|$|... "Melt Away" [...] was a song Carey {{produced}} on her own, and co-wrote with Babyface. The song's writing and production were [...] "superb". with each verse gliding into its chorus. According to Chris Nickson, [...] "Underneath the Stars" [...] was as [...] "strong as any slow jam {{released in the}} nineties, and one that would {{find a lot of}} flavor late at night with dancers." [...] Another song that brought back reminders of older decades was [...] "Forever". The throwback was featured through the chord changes and in the way the guitar arpeggios [...] "stayed {{at the forefront of the}} music." [...] The song displayed subtle vocals from Carey, as well as an undeniable richness. [...] "Daydream Interlude (Sweet Fantasy Dub Mix)" [...] was one of the liveliest tracks on the album. The song was a club remix of [...] "Fantasy", which was tuned and remixed by famed house music producer David Morales. The song was directed to be a dance-club song, further broadening Carey's [...] "musical horizon". The song incorporated Carey's vocals, and added them to a thumping house beat, something he would do for many of her future singles. [...] "Looking In" [...] was the final song on the album. Written in 15 minutes, it was Carey's most personal song at the time, one in which <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>herself</b> appear [...] "naked" [...] and [...] "stripped down; it was written by her and Afanasieff.|$|E

60|$|She made small {{eyes at me}} to {{discover}} if I was angry. She seemed to have an invincible faith in the virtuous dispositions of young men. And as I had spoken in measured tones and hadnâ€™t got {{red in the face}} <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>herself</b> go.|$|E
60|$|As <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>herself</b> {{down into}} the ooze, she {{reflected}} that all farmers have hearts of gold, anatomical phenomena never found among the snobs and hirelings of New York.
