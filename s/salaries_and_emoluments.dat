60|$|And it pleased the Lord Almighty, that in {{the year}} one {{thousand}} four hundred and ninety-two, I should discover the continent of the Indies and many islands, among them Hispaniola, which the Indians called Ayte, and the Monicongos, Cipango. I then returned to Castile to their highnesses, who approved of my undertaking a second enterprise for farther discoveries and settlements; and the Lord gave me victory over the island of Hispaniola, which extends six hundred leagues, and I conquered it and made it tributary; and I discovered many islands inhabited by cannibals, and seven hundred {{to the west of}} Hispaniola, among which is Jamaica, which we call Santiago; and three hundred and thirty-three leagues of continent from south to west, besides a hundred and seven to the north, which I discovered in my first voyage, together with many islands, as may more clearly be seen by my letters, memorials, and maritime charts.

Sir John Craig wrote in his history of the Royal Mint: [...] "The arrangement was not put into writing, and misunderstanding was easy for a foreigner. Pole categorically denied any commitment beyond the grant for the time being of a salary for coinage designs as cheaper than payment of fees. The Italian persistently contended that he was seduced into Mint service by a promise of formal appointment to the chief engravership". According to H.W.A.

40|$|Abstract:- Payroll is a {{critical}} operation for every organization to pay employee accurately their <b>salary</b> <b>and</b> <b>emoluments</b> on time. For a big organization, {{the idea of taking}} control of employees pay calculations is quite daunting. This computer based payroll system aims to explain in simple terms what payroll involves and demystify the payroll processes. Moreover it is a powerful tool to streamline the time consuming and complex tasks of employee payroll scheduling and planning. This system provides multiple user data access. Each user walks through the entire payroll process as per rights allocated from adding new employee to generate pay slips with clear step by step instructions. Furthermore the system is flexible to implement changes in pay scales. This Computer based payroll system is capable of keeping a record of employee data including their pay, allowances, deductions and taxes on monthly bases so that fresh definitions are reflected from the month onwards, which leaves all the past data intact. This system has been developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ajax and database has been designed using MySQL. The proposed computer based payroll system is advantageous as it provides a user friendly environment. This payroll system increases security and minimizes human calculation errors...|$|R

40|$|Kenya’s {{civil service}} {{expanded}} rapidly after independence, becoming {{by far the}} largest in East Africa. Following economic decline since the 1980 s, however, it became difficult for the government to sustain a large and inefficient public sector. To raise efficiency, extensive civil service reforms and changes in its incentive structure were necessary to reflect the government’s new priorities. The main factors affecting performance in the civil service include low <b>salaries</b> <b>and</b> allowances for the civil servants, lack of equipment and office space, poor compensation, absence of a career-development structure, and poor delegation. This paper examines factors affecting efficiency in the Kenyan civil service with emphasis on incentive structures, ranging from wage <b>emoluments,</b> training <b>and</b> promotion procedures and sanctions against poor performance. Several incentive realignments for improving efficiency in the civil service emerge. First, <b>salaries</b> <b>and</b> other <b>emoluments</b> of the civil service should be improved to a level deemed conducive to increasing morale and productivity and maintained to preserve it in real terms via periodic reviews and in line with macroeconomic developments.

40|$|Boardroom reward {{continues}} to attract controversy, despite the structural changes in corporate governance arrangements {{over the past}} decade. This study responds to Pettigrew's (1992) call to eschew over-ambitious attempts to demonstrate causality {{in the area of}} executive management and firm performance, in favour of redressing the overwhelmingly prescriptive bias in the literature. A simple but important task is to 'begin to provide some basic descriptive findings about boards and their directors', and open up 'the black box of board behaviour'- in this case, that of board remuneration committees. Interpretations of comparative market signals play a part in deliberations between the leading actors responsible for determining executive directors' <b>salary,</b> bonuses <b>and</b> other <b>emoluments.</b> But the position is more deeply textured than the reified influence of (global) market forces sometimes implied in the normative literature. The study reported, based on qualitative interviews, taps in to the nuances of decision taking in respect of boardroom reward management, including remuneration committee members' reactions to corporate governance reforms. Such initiatives locate non-executive directors in the role of intermediaries in the principal-agent relationship, explicitly assigned to resolve the conflict of interest inherent in boardroom remuneration systems, while simultaneously they are expected to play a team role as board members responsible for the overall strategy and operation of the company. The study is indicative: an attempt to open up research questions around the context and process of boardroom reward management that earlier analyses may have ignored or overlooked.

6000|$|I {{know that}} {{positive}} prohibitions, that acts of Parliament, that covenants, are things of very little validity indeed, {{as long as}} all the means of corruption are left in power, and all the temptations to corrupt profit are left in poverty. I should really think that the Company deserved to be ill served, {{if they had not}} annexed such appointments to great trusts as might secure the persons intrusted from the temptations of unlawful <b>emolument,</b> <b>and,</b> what in all cases is the greatest security, given a lawful gratification to the natural passions of men. Matrimony is to be used, as a true remedy against a vicious course of profligate manners; fair <b>and</b> lawful <b>emoluments,</b> <b>and</b> the just profits of office, are opposed to the unlawful means which might be made use of to supply them. For, in truth, I am ready to agree, that for any man to expect a series of sacrifices without a return in blessings, to expect labor without a prospect of reward, and fatigue without any means of securing rest, is an unreasonable demand in any human creature from another. Those who trust that they shall find in men uncommon and heroic virtues are themselves endeavoring to have nothing paid them but the common returns of the worst parts of human infirmity. And therefore I shall show your Lordships that the Company did provide large, ample, abundant means for supporting the Governor-General,--that Lord Clive, in the year 1765, and the Council with him, of which Mr. Sumner, I am glad and proud to say, was one, did fix such an allowance as they thought a sufficient security to the Governor-General against the temptations attendant upon his situation; and therefore, after they had fixed this sum, they say, [...] "that, although by this means the Governor {{will not be able to}} amass a million or half a million in the space of two or three years, yet he will acquire a very handsome independency, and be in that very situation which a man of honor and true zeal for the service would wish to possess. Thus situated, he may defy all opposition in Council; he will have nothing to ask, nothing to propose, but what he wishes for the advantage of his employers; he may defy the law, because there can be no foundation for a bill of discovery; and he may defy the obloquy of the world, because there can be nothing censurable in his conduct. In short, if stability can be insured to such a government as this, where riches have been acquired in abundance in a small space of time, by all ways and means, and by men with or without capacities, it must be effected by a Governor thus restricted,"--that is, a Governor restricted from every emolument but that of his salary. I must remark, that this <b>salary</b> <b>and</b> these <b>emoluments</b> were not settled upon the vague speculations of men taking the measure of their necessities for India from the manners of England; but it was fixed by the Council themselves,--fixed in India,--fixed by those who knew and were in the situation of the Governor-General, and who knew what was necessary to support his dignity and to preserve him from the temptation of corruption: and they have laid open to you such a body of advantages arising from it as would lead any man, who had a regard to his honor or conscience, to think himself happy in having such a provision made for him, and at the same time every temptation to act corruptly removed far from him.|$|R

But the good mien of the young man now in nomination was such, that he rather hastened to exchange congratulation on meeting with so proper a subject of promotion, than to indulge any other feeling. Father Eustace enjoyed the pleasure which a well-constituted mind derives from seeing a benefit light on a deserving object; for as he had not seen Halbert since circumstances had made so material a change in his manner and feelings, he scarce doubted that the proffered appointment would, notwithstanding his mother's uncertainty, suit the disposition of a youth who had appeared devoted to woodland sports, and a foe alike to sedentary or settled occupation of any kind.
