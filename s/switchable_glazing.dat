By using software EnergyPlus, {{it was found that}} application of <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing</b> would lead to a reduction in annual cooling electricity consumption by up to 6. 6 % where the actual amount depends on existence of overhangs, orientation of building wings, types and locations of rooms. Energy saving by this magnitude, however, cannot justify use of <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing</b> in residential buildings in Hong Kong, mainly because of the high glazing cost.

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of adaptive building envelope technologies, and particularly of <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing,</b> can make {{significant contributions to}} decarbonisation targets. It is therefore essential to quantify their effect on building energy use and indoor environmental quality when integrated into buildings. The evaluation of their performance presents new challenges when compared to conventional “static” building envelope systems, as they require design and control aspects to be evaluated together, which are also mutually interrelated across thermal and visual physical domains. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel simulation framework for the performance evaluation of responsive building envelope technologies and, particularly, of <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing.</b> This is achieved by integrating a building energy simulation tool and a lighting simulation one, in a control optimisation framework to simulate advanced control of adaptive building envelopes. The performance of a photovoltachromic glazing is evaluated according to building energy use, Useful Daylight Illuminance, glare risk and load profile matching indicators for a sun oriented office building in different temperate climates. The original architecture of photovoltachromic cell provides an automatic control of its transparency {{as a function of}} incoming solar irradiance. However, to fully explore the building integration potential of photovoltachromic technology, different control strategies are evaluated, from passive and simple rule based controls, to optimised rule based and predictive controls. The results show that the control strategy has {{a significant impact on the}} performance of the photovoltachromic <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing,</b> and of <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing</b> technologies in general. More specifically, simpler control strategies are generally unable to optimise contrasting requirements, while more advanced ones can increase energy saving potential without compromising visual comfort. In cooling dominated scenarios reactive control can be as effective as predictive for a <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing,</b> differently than heating dominated scenarios where predictive control strategies yield higher energy saving potential. Introducing glare as a control parameter can significantly decrease the energy efficiency of some control strategies, especially in heating dominated climates...|$|E

A window system based on a thermotropic glass pane was tested both in the laboratory and by means of an outdoor test cell facility. In this paper the full optical and thermal characterization of this glazing technology is presented.

40|$|A virtual {{test cell}} {{representing}} {{a portion of}} an office building was modeled in order to evaluate the energy balance and the economic convenience related to the use, as solar control devices, of a <b>switchable</b> electrochromic <b>glazing</b> system (EG) and of an automated external venetian blind system (VB). Furthermore, results were compared with a so-called base case (BC) of the glazed component, with no exterior solar shading. The virtual test cell is supposed located in Milan, Italy. The operation of both shading systems was set {{in order to minimize}} undesirable solar heat gains during cooling season and to maximize them during heating season and also in order to optimize the daylighting performance without having glare effect on the work plane. The energy balance of the selected systems was done considering the annual primary energy consumption for heating, cooling, lighting, shading system operation and the glazed systems’ embodied energy annual quota. Finally, a further comparison in terms of economic convenience was done.

40|$|Electrochromic {{devices for}} use as <b>switchable</b> {{architectural}} <b>glazing</b> have developed rapidly over the past decade. There are now several companies with marketable (or near market) products, of quite substantial size. There is also a wide variety in the designs of the devices used in these products, in particular, the ionic conductor and ion storage layers. As a result, these devices exhibit some quite different switching characteristics, {{and it is still}} unclear what the long-term life and degradation behaviour of these devices will be. There are many open questions about how to control the devices in real operating conditions, where the temperature will be significantly above room temperature, and what the effect of increasing the area is on the lifetime. This paper reviews the way in which electrochromic devices switch and introduces models for all aspects of the device performance, in particular, the effects of electrical conductivity of the transparent electrodes, the ionic conductivity of the ion conductor, the device size and the temperature of operation. The application of these models to the design of large area electrochromic windows for architectural applications is then discussed and some examples of the use of the models to understand device behaviour and to determine how best to switch devices are presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSwitchable glazing {{technologies}} {{seem to be}} {{a promising}} component of solar buildings. <b>Switchable</b> <b>glazing</b> may controllably and invertably change its physical and visual properties by switching. Having been applied in buildings envelopes, the <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing</b> technologies are frequently regarded as an alternative measure for traditional solar protection elements like: blinds, louvres, overhangs etc. Yet, they are more integrated with buildings envelope creating kind of interactive barrier between external and internal environment. They also provide sleek and changeable glazed envelopes, thus becoming an important element of buildings architecture, too. The glass technologies to be considered in the paper are: SPD (suspended particle devices) LCD (liquid crystal devices), EC (electrochromic), GC (gasochromic) and micro-blinds technology. The paper concentrates on architectural evaluation of the application of the <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing</b> technologies as sun protection measures. They are examined in context of their influence on thermal and visual comfort first of all. Besides, aesthetical and energy –efficiency issues have been discussed. The paper is aimed at showing opportunities connected with application of the different <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing</b> technologies according to their impact on architecture. To this aim a comparative method has been used. The technologies were compared with each other on the following fields: thermal protection, lighting protection, visual contact, aesthetic variability, electricity consumption. It has been proved that the above mentioned technologies exert different impact on internal environment of the building and its architecture. They are relevant for different tasks- e. g. some of them are especially suitable for thermal protection, whereas the others should be used as visual control measure first of all. All of the technologies may be used both in hot and cold climates, but the way they should be used in the buildings envelope (e. g. place, solar orientation) are different...|$|E
40|$|Suspended {{particle}} device (SPD) <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing</b> {{has potential}} to control transmission of solar radiation in the visible range by changing its transparency from 55 % to 5 %. Outdoor test cell characterisation of a SPD <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing</b> offered the dynamic {{solar heat gain}} coefficient (SHGC) which varied between 0. 05 (when opaque) and 0. 38 (when transparent). Reduction of maximum temperature rise of 11 % and 15 % was possible using SPD “transparent” and “opaque” state compared to same area double-glazing. Insulated test cell with water flow heat exchanger was employed to measure the cooling load reduction potential of SPD glazing while its transmission changed from “transparent” to “opaque” state. A cooling load reduction up to 6 kW h for a 0. 343 m 3 volume test cell was possible by changing a 0. 21 m × 0. 28 m SPD glazing transparency from “transparent” to “opaque”. Average overall heat transfer coefficient of SPD glazing varied between 5. 02 W/m 2 K and 5. 2 W/m 2 K for two different states...|$|E

SPD glazing 2 ̆ 7 s near normal transmission varies with incident angle and clearness index. Due to a lower diffuse component, higher glazing transmission ensues at higher clearness indices. Transmittance values for different azimuthal incident angle for a SPD glazing for its “transparent” and “opaque” states have been determined. In Dublin, below 0. 5 clearness index, isotropic diffuse transmittance was prevailed while transmission of direct insolation was dominant above 0. 5 clearness index.

40|$|A {{need for}} {{innovation}} in building envelope technologies forms {{a key element}} of technology roadmaps focusing on improvements in building energy efficiency. Many new products are being proposed and developed, but often, a lack of insights into building integration issues is an obstacle in typical product development processes. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the potential of expanding the application area of whole-building performance simulation and analysis towards decision-making support in the domain of research and development of such innovative building products. We propose a simulation-based approach that can help overcome several of the existing limitations. The methodology combines building performance simulation together with sensitivity analysis and structured parametric studies to provide multi-scale, multi-disciplinary information about the performance of different product variants. The strength of this computational approach lies in increased opportunity for analysis and informed decision-making on the basis of whole-building performance information, and therefore less dependence on trial and error procedures. This methodology is illustrated in an application example of a new type of <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing</b> where we give recommended directions for improved product specifications...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} energy {{conservation}} in buildings has spurred innovations in window technologies. These products include windows combined with shading devices, and windows featuring complex glazing such as <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing,</b> diffuse glazing, translucent and transparent insulation, patterned or decorative glass, etc. Current fenestration simulation tools for energy performance product ratings do not cover complex fenestration products. This paper addresses {{the development of}} detailed calculation models to compute the optical characteristics of complex fenestration products {{made up of a}} mixture of clear and scattering glazing layers. The models take into account not only the optical properties of the individual glazing layers making up the window product, but also the haze and gloss properties of the glazing layers. Specific optical models are developed to compute the optics of a clear substrate with applied or laminated scattering film, and composite film made up of a number of homogeneous materials with known optical properties. A general optical model was also developed for screen-like glazing panes such as insect/shading screens, roller blinds, drapery sheets, honeycomb transparent insulation and fibreglass translucent glazing...|$|E

With its use, requirements for cooling in buildings can be reduced, what involves a contribution to sustainable building. The system is composed by to glass sheets (treated and coated with different layers), which contain inside the elements of liquid crystal and other needed elements. No environmental assessment has been made for the switchable element. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to assess the environmental impact of the production phase of switchable glass.

40|$|The latest European {{energy policy}} aimed at {{reducing}} the energy demand and CO 2 emissions due to the building sector has been pushing researchers, designers, manufacturers and contractors towards the development of novel concepts and technical solutions, with special emphasis on building envelope. Relevant improvements {{can be achieved by}} adopting a new approach, conceiving envelope components as "living" membranes, efficiently interacting with indoors and outdoors boundary conditions and with users' needs thus performing an adaptive behaviour. Adaptiveness may be based on different driving factors, may perform at different timescales (from few minutes/ hours to diurnal/seasonal variations) and may take place at different components'/systems' levels (macro or micro scale).

40|$|This lecture summary {{provides}} a short but comprehensive overview on the “energy and buildings” topic. Buildings account for roughly 40 % {{of the global}} energy demands. Thus, an increased adoption of existing and upcoming materials and solutions for the building sector represents an enormous potential to reduce building related energy demands and greenhouse gas emissions. The central question is how the building envelope (insulation, fenestration, construction style, solar control) affects building energy demands. Compared to conventional insulation materials, superinsulation materials such as vacuum insulation panels and silica aerogel achieve the same thermal performance with significantly thinner insulation layers. With low-emissivity coatings and appropriate filler gasses, double and triple glazing reduce thermal losses by up to {{an order of magnitude}} compared to old single pane windows, while vacuum insulation and aerogel filled glazing could reduce these even further. Electrochromic and other <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing</b> solutions maximize solar gains during wintertime and minimize illumination demands whilst avoiding overheating in summer. Upon integration of renewable energy systems into the building energy supply, buildings can become both producers and consumers of energy. Combined with dynamic user behavior, temporal variations in the production of renewable energy require appropriate storage solutions, both thermal and electrical, and the integration of buildings into smart grids and energy district networks. The combination of these measures allows a reduction of the existing building stock by roughly a factor of three —a promising, but cost intensive way, to prepare our buildings for the energy turnaround...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} energy efficient residential windows in hot and humid climates. To accomplish this analysis, the use of accurate simulation tools such as DOE- 2. 1 e is required, which incorporates {{the results from the}} WINDOW- 5. 2 simulation program to assess accurate fenestration performance. The thesis also investigates the use of optimal glazing types, which, for future applications, could be specified in the code to reduce annual net energy consumption to zero. Results show that combinations of low-E and double pane, clear-glazed windows, which are optimally shaded according to orientation are the best solution for lowering both annual energy consumption and peak electricity loads. The study also concludes that the method used to model fenestration in the simulation program {{plays an important role in}} accurately determining the effectiveness of the glazing option used. In this particular study, the use of the WINDOW- 5. 2 program is highly recommended especially for high performance windows (i. e., low-E glazing). Finally, a discussion on the incorporation of super high performance windows (i. e., super low-E, ultra low-E and dynamic / <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing)</b> into the IECC code concludes that these types of glazing strategies can reduce annual net energy use of the window to zero. Future work identified by this thesis includes a more extensive examination of the passive solar potential of high performance fenestration, and an examination of the appropriate methods for specifying these properties in future versions of the IECC code. This implies that future specifications for fenestration in the IECC code could aim for zero net annual energy consumption levels from residential fenestration...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} window {{area on the}} energy balance of a {{building}} was investigated by simulations in DEROB-LTH. The glazed area was varied in three types of buildings with different types of glazing and for several climates. One low energy house was compared to a less insulated house but identical in size and layout. Three different types of glazing were used; uncoated double glazing, double glazing with one low-e coated pane and triple glazing with two low-e coated panes. Climates with variations in solar radiation, mean temperature, altitude and latitude were chosen. The results show that if energy efficient window alternatives are chosen the flexibility of choosing the glazed area and orientation is higher. Choosing a larger area facing south resulted in a higher heating demand for uncoated double glazing in the standard house. An increased area also resulted in an increased peak load for heating for all the simulated cases. Choosing the energy efficient glazing type gave a decrease in heating demand for increased south facing glazed area in the standard house. In the low energy house the difference in heating demand between different areas was smaller than for the standard house. An office module with two types of <b>switchable</b> <b>glazing</b> and one solar control glazing unit was used in three different climates; Stockholm, Brussels and Rome. Larger window areas increase the cooling demand but if glazing types with lower solar transmittance are used, the difference in cooling demand between different window areas decreases. An extremely large window area, however, increases the peak load both for cooling and for heating and should therefore be avoided. Energy can be saved by using switchable windows instead of solar control or in particular standard glazing...|$|E
