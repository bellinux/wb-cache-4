2500|$|As the United States {{became a}} {{participant}} in World War I, Camp Abraham Eustis was established in 1918 in neighboring Warwick County. [...] It encompassed Mulberry Island and some adjacent mainland. A few miles upstream, also along the James River, a satellite facility, Camp Wallace, was established in 1918 as the Upper Firing Range for artillery training. [...] Camp Wallace was the first site of the Army's aerial tramway. [...] In 1923 the Camp became Fort Eustis.

2500|$|.....seemed to us {{necessary}} {{to ensure that the}} pattern of local government was such as to make the planning of development and the organisation of services fully effective, and to make certain that new development, such as houses, main roads, bridges and shops would match the growth and location of industry instead of perpetuating the patterns of the past. We were impressed by the need on Tees-side for more housing to relieve overcrowding, to replace outworn properties, and to meet the increase in population due to industrial expansion. Yet unless Teesside could be planned as a whole, it seemed to us impossible to ensure that new houses would be built in places most convenient for the people who would live in them, as it was difficult for the present ten <b>separate</b> <b>housing</b> authorities, each with their own housing list, to do other than build within or near their own boundaries...|$|E
2500|$|Standing at {{the center}} of the {{university}} is the iconic Geisel Library, named after Dr. Seuss. Library Walk, a heavily traveled pathway leading from the library to Gilman Drive, lies adjacent or close to Price Center, Center Hall, International Center, and various student services buildings, including the Student Services Center and the Career Services building. The layout of the main campus centers on Geisel Library, which is roughly surrounded by the six residential colleges of Revelle, Muir, Marshall, Warren, Roosevelt, and Sixth, and the School of Medicine. The six colleges maintain <b>separate</b> <b>housing</b> facilities for their students and each college's buildings are differentiated by distinct architectural styles. As residential colleges were added while the university expanded, buildings in newer colleges were designed with styles that were starkly different from that of the original campus. The disparate architectural styles led Travel + Leisure, in its October 2013 issue, to name the university as one of the ugliest campuses in America, likening it to [...] "a cupboard full of kitchen appliances whose function you can't quite fathom." ...|$|E
