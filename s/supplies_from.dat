5|$|Although no {{large-scale}} {{evacuation of}} <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> Warsaw was ordered, the Modlin Fortress was well {{prepared for a}} lengthy siege. Its magazines contained over 25,000 cannonballs, almost 900 thousand musket and rifle rounds and enough provisions for several months of full siege. The treasury of the Polish government was still intact and contained more than 6.5 million złotys.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1798 the Legions under Kniaziewicz were {{fighting}} against the anti-French forces from the Kingdom of Naples, defeating them at the Battle of Civita Castellana on 4 December. Soon afterward, <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> the captured Gaeta fortress allowed {{the creation of a}} Legion cavalry unit under Andrzej Karwowski. The Poles then fought at Magliano, Falari, Calvi and Capua before Naples capitulated on 23 January.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 10 June a group of senior officers, including General Douglas MacArthur, his air commander General George Kenney, and Australians Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead and Air Vice Marshal William Bostock (head of RAAF Command), made an inspection tour of the Labuan beachhead. MacArthur insisted on seeing Australian soldiers in action, and the party visited a group of front line infantrymen before departing. The process of unloading <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> the invasion fleet during 10 June proceeded quickly, and the ships began to depart for Morotai during {{the afternoon}} of 11 June.|$|E
5|$|On January 21, four {{government}} witnesses testified. The testimony {{tended to}} prove that: the Spray was seen on March 15 with Jackalow and the Leetes aboard; Jackalow was {{seen on the}} vessel alone on March 17 and 18, heading to New York City; Jackalow purchased <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> a grocer in Brooklyn on March 19 with a roll of banknotes, including one $50 bill from the Mechanics Bank, and asked for change in coins.

5|$|The Action of 22 January 1809 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{fought off}} the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe during the Napoleonic Wars. The action was fought {{as part of the}} blockade of Guadeloupe and neighbouring Martinique by a large British Royal Navy squadron, which was seeking to cut the islands off from contact and <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> France by preventing the passage of shipping from Europe to the islands. The British blockade was part of their preparation for planned invasions during the next year.|$|E
5|$|The Kosovo {{conflict}} escalated {{over the}} summer of 1998, and the KLA increasingly took to smuggling weapons and <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> Albania {{across the border into}} Kosovo. In September, Yugoslav officials stated that 90 militants had been killed while attempting to illegally cross the border since January of that year. The Yugoslav Defense Ministry reported that 947 rifles, 161 light machine guns, 33 mortars, 55 mines, 3,295 hand grenades, and almost 350,000 rounds of ammunition had been confiscated over the same period.|$|E
5|$|The Tobruk {{garrison}} received <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> the Royal Navy and Rommel {{was unable}} to take the port. This failure was significant; his front line positions at Sollum were {{at the end of}} an extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. The substantial commitment required to invest Tobruk prevented him from building up his forces at Sollum, making further advances into Egypt impractical. By maintaining possession of Tobruk, the Allies had regained the initiative.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle of}} Bình Giã {{reflected}} the Viet Cong's growing military strength and influence, {{especially in the}} Mekong Delta region. It {{was the first time}} the Viet Cong launched a large-scale operation, holding its ground and fighting for four days against government troops equipped with armor, artillery and helicopters, and aided by U.S. air support and military advisers. The Viet Cong demonstrated that, when well-supplied with military <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> North Vietnam, they had the ability to fight and inflict damage even on the best ARVN units.|$|E
5|$|The {{court records}} of the Nguyễn dynasty in Huế, the Đại Nam thực lục (Veritable Records of the Great South) dispute the French claims, {{revealing}} that the court attempted to prevent illegal guerrilla activity {{by the likes of}} Định. However, in one edict, Định claimed that Tự Đức endorsed his struggle, in an attempt to garner popular support. This fuelled French claims that the guerrillas were periodically traveling between French territory and the adjoining sovereign Nguyễn territory to get <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> provincial officials.|$|E
5|$|The fort {{was linked}} to a jetty, Coalhouse Wharf, on the {{riverside}} a short distance to the south. A standard gauge railway track led from the fort's interior to the jetty and was used to bring guns and <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> the wharf. The heaviest guns were transported to and from Coalhouse Fort (and other Thames forts) aboard two specialised gun barges called Gog and Magog, built in 1886 and 1900 respectively and used until the 1960s. The remains of the jetty are still visible, as are sections of the track within the fort's entrance.|$|E

Much of the railway {{has been converted}} to footpath, {{and many of the}} buildings formerly served by the line are now abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The {{supremacy}} of the Fifth Air Force {{in the skies}} over Korea forced the North Koreans {{in the first month}} of the war to resort to night movement of supplies to the battle area. They relied primarily on railroads to move supplies to the front, however a shortage of trucks posed the most serious problem of getting <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> the trains to individual units, forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} Allied {{offensive in}} May finally {{broke through the}} Gustav Line, and Rome fell to Clark's army on 4 June. On 13 June, Devers ordered Larkin to shift priority for <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> Fifth Army in Italy to Seventh Army. Two days later, Wilson ordered VI Corps to be withdrawn from the front line in preparation for Anvil. Virtually all the material needed for the assault was on hand, on the way, or promised, thanks to Devers' efforts to preserve the stockpile of Anvil stores and supplies even when the operation was in doubt. To command the assault, he created a special headquarters on Corsica called Advanced Detachment AFHQ, with Devers in command.|$|E

5|$|All this {{economic}} power was ultimately under the pharaoh's control, and temple products and property were often taxed. Their employees, even the priests, {{were subject to}} the state corvée system, which conscripted labor for royal projects. They could also be ordered to provide supplies for some specific purposes. Harkhuf's trading expedition in the Old Kingdom was allowed to procure <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> any temple it wished, and the mortuary temples of the Theban Necropolis in the New Kingdom oversaw the provision of the royally employed tomb workers at Deir el-Medina. Kings could also exempt temples or classes of personnel from taxation and conscription.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal {{was pressed}} into service, {{delivering}} aircraft to Malta during several supply runs throughout June and July, and escorting the convoys of Operation Substance in July and Operation Halberd in September. Despite some losses, the convoys succeeded in keeping Malta supplied and fighting. The continued Allied presence in Malta was a considerable problem for Rommel in Africa, who was losing {{as much as}} ⅓ of his <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> Italy to submarines and bombers based there. Adolf Hitler decided to send a flotilla of U-boats into the Mediterranean to attack Allied shipping, {{against the advice of}} Großadmiral Raeder.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{then led}} {{many of the}} {{remaining}} smaller craft into a small bay on the Vermont shore now named Arnold's Bay 2 miles south of Buttonmold Bay, where the waters were too shallow for the larger British vessels to follow. These boats were then run aground, stripped, and set on fire, with their flags still flying. Arnold, the last to land, personally torched his flagship Congress. The surviving ships' crews, numbering about 200, then made their way overland to Crown Point, narrowly escaping an Indian ambush. There they found Trumbull, New York, Enterprise, and Revenge, all of which had escaped the British fleet, as well as Liberty, which had just arrived with <b>supplies</b> <b>from</b> Ticonderoga.|$|E
