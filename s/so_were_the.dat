5|$|The temperance movement, {{which had}} been absorbed into the moralistic system of the Nonconformist chapels, caused a shift in social attitudes in the mid- to late-19th- and early-20th century Rhondda. Alcohol was looked down upon and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> {{increasingly}} violent sports such as rugby, so young men looked for different and more acceptable pastimes. Voice choirs were a natural progression from chapel society, and brass bands would eventually gain acceptance by the movement.|$|E

The Presbyter Julian and the Bishop Longinus conducted a mission among the Nabataeans, and Justinian attempted to strengthen Christianity in Yemen by despatching a bishop from Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The Haraldskær Woman (or Haraldskjaer Woman) is a bog {{body of a}} woman found {{naturally}} {{preserved in}} a bog in Jutland, Denmark, and dating from about 490 BC (pre-Roman Iron Age). Workers found the body in 1835 while excavating peat on the Haraldskær Estate. The anaerobic conditions and acids of the peat bog contributed to the body's excellent preservation. Not only was the intact skeleton found, but <b>so</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> skin and internal organs. Scientists settled disputes about the age and identity of this well preserved body in 1977, when radiocarbon dating determined conclusively that the woman's death occurred around the 5th century BC.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of whether the defences would have been effective in invasion is vexed. In mid-1940, the preparations relied heavily upon field fortifications. The First World War made it clear that assaulting prepared defences with infantry was deadly and difficult, but similar preparations in Belgium had been overrun by well-equipped German Panzer divisions in the early weeks of 1940 and with so many armaments left at Dunkirk, British forces were woefully ill-equipped to take on German armour. On the other hand, while British preparations for defence were ad hoc, <b>so</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> German invasion plans: a fleet of 2,000 converted barges and other vessels had been hurriedly made available and their fitness was debatable; in any case, the Germans could not land troops with all their heavy equipment. Until the Germans captured a port, both armies would have been short of tanks and heavy guns.|$|E
5|$|The tournament was {{expanded}} to 24 teams in 1982, {{and then to}} 32 in 1998, also allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. Since then, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, with several having reached the quarter-finals: Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1986; Cameroon, quarter-finalists in 1990; South Korea, finishing in fourth place in 2002; Senegal, along with USA, both quarter-finalists in 2002; Ghana, quarter-finalists in 2010; and Costa Rica, quarter-finalists in 2014. Nevertheless, European and South American teams continue to dominate, e.g., the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998, and 2006 were all from Europe or South America and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> finalists of all tournaments so far.|$|E

25|$|Storms, fire, {{and high}} {{maintenance}} costs caused major {{problems in the}} centuries after 1600. The monastery underwent many changes until 1930.

The logical explanation of this was that the creatures were the self-illuminating, so blinding and luminous that they didn't notice the Sun. The Earth was covered in their light. So, when the materialization took place, the light faded inside their newly conceived 'body' of mud and thus the night and day became apparent to them. Then, as the night and day became apparent, seasons and years also appeared.|$|E
25|$|Having escaped prosecution, Clodius {{attained}} the aedileship for 57 BC. He {{then started}} proceedings against Milo for inciting violence, the same charge Milo had brought against him. He {{did not expect}} conviction as Milo had many powerful allies, including Cicero and Pompey. He used this to attack both his followers and Pompey. He got his supporters to taunt Pompey in the assemblies. Pompey could not do much about it. He also continued his attacks on Cicero. The latter claimed that his transitio ad plebem was illegal and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> laws he had passed, including the one that sanctioned his exile. Clashes between the two factions continued.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} part of the war, as armed {{merchant}} cruisers equipped with antique guns and very little armour, Prince David and her sisters were sent to hunt enemy submarines and surface ships, tasks better suited to warships. As the needs of the RCN changed, <b>so</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> 'Prince' ships able to adapt to new roles. Their flexibility offered the RCN greater scope and balance in its operations. They did not function as did the bulk of the Canadian fleet: no rushing back and forth across the ocean, cold and damp, chained to 50 degrees North. Prince David and her sisters, each with two separate employments, roamed most of the navigable world forming a little navy apart.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{had been}} {{initially}} planned to hold more than just one international trial at the IMT, the growing differences between the victorious allies (the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Soviet Union) made this impossible. However, the Control Council Law No. 10, which the Allied Control Council had issued on 20 December 1945, empowered any of the occupying authorities to try suspected war criminals in their respective occupation zones. Based on this law, the U.S. authorities proceeded {{after the end of}} the initial Nuremberg Trial against the major war criminals to hold another twelve trials in Nuremberg. The judges in all these trials were American, and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> prosecutors; the Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution was Brigadier General Telford Taylor. In the other occupation zones similar trials took place.|$|E
25|$|The {{club was}} one of the {{foundation}} members of the Sydney rugby football league competition in 1908. Founded at a meeting on 4 February 1908 at Ashfield Town Hall, they won only one match the following season <b>so</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> League's second wooden spooners (after Cumberland in 1908). Though they spent long periods of time as also-rans they did taste premiership success four times in the mid 20th century. They won their first premiership in 1930, beating St George 27–2. Four years later they defeated Eastern Suburbs to win their second title. For the 1944 NSWRFL season Queensland 1910s representative player Henry Bolewski became coach the Western Suburbs club, replacing Alf Blair, who moved to South Sydney. Wests improved slightly on the previous season, finishing 5th (out of 8), but failing to make the finals, and Bolewski was replaced by club great, Frank McMillan.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} {{was to have}} been a more {{powerful}} and reusable solid fuel rocket derived from the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). Compared with the Solid Rocket Booster, which had four segments, the most notable difference was the addition of a fifth segment. This fifth segment would have enabled the Ares I to produce more thrust. Other changes made to the Solid Rocket Booster were to have been the removal of the Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) attachment points and the replacement of the Solid Rocket Booster nosecone with a new forward adapter that would have interfaced with the liquid-fueled second stage. The adapter {{was to have been}} equipped with solid-fueled separation motors to facilitate the disconnection of the stages during ascent. The grain design was also changed, and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> insulation and liner. By the Ares I first stage ground test, the case, grain design, number of segments, insulation, liner, throat diameter, thermal protection systems and nozzle had all changed.|$|E

25|$|After installment, Mircea offered rewards to Paisie's {{prominent}} rivals, the Drăgoești family. Staico Șintescu, {{who lost}} his high rank under the new regime, remained a prominent supporter of the deposed Prince, as did Radu Furcovici, who was driven into exile. In 1546, Mircea put to death Clucer Coadă and his brother Radu, while forcing Coadă's children to take refuge in Transylvania. The new monarch tried to coax other Paisie loyalists into returning, sending Barbu of Pietroșani, orphaned son of Toma, to bribe them. The effort was a failure, but <b>so</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> exiles' various attempts to remove Mircea. Over the following months, Mircea's violence lost him {{the support of his}} own boyars. In 1547, Barbu and the Drăgoești absconded with Wallachia's haraç money and became wanted men. Barbu was ultimately delivered by the Ottomans to Bucharest, where he was executed in April 1548. By then, both the Paisie exiles and Wallachia had lost control of Prince Radu's Transylvanian estates, which became a demesne of George Martinuzzi.|$|E
25|$|At this point, in 1707, Peter {{offered to}} retrocede {{everything}} he had so far occupied (essentially Ingria) except Saint Petersburg and {{the line of the}} Neva, to avoid a full-scale war, but Charles XII refused. Instead he initiated a march from Saxony to invade Russia. Though his primary goal was Moscow, the strength of his forces was sapped by the cold weather (the winter of 1708/09 being one of the most severe in modern European history) and Peter's use of scorched earth tactics. When the main army turned south to recover in Ukraine, the second army with supplies and reinforcements was intercepted and routed at Lesnaya—and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> supplies and reinforcements of Swedish ally Ivan Mazepa in Baturyn. Charles was crushingly defeated by a larger Russian force under Peter in the Battle of Poltava and fled to the Ottoman Empire while the remains of his army surrendered at Perevolochna.|$|E
25|$|The 1996–97 Hammer {{campaign}} nosedived towards disaster {{after starting}} {{in an average}} fashion. Injuries to key and back-up players were critical (losing Stan Lazaridis to a broken leg, for instance, and {{what turned out to}} be the career-ending injury to the promising Richard Hall signed only months before for £1.5million from Southampton), but <b>so</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> failed signings and some poor performances. The form of Michael Hughes (signed permanently after two years on loan from Strasbourgh) and performances of loan signing Hugo Porfírio were a rare bright spot, as was the emergence of future England teammates Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard. In a 2–2 draw with Manchester United, Răducioiu contributed a curling left footed shot around a full-stretch Peter Schmeichel. At Christmas, the team sat in midtable with only five wins and seven draws from 19 games, at which point they added one point from the next six games, sending the team to the bottom of the table.|$|E
