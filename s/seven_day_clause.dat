40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comMinimal information exists as to how women who give birth more than <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> after initial corticosteroid treatment, who may benefit from repeat prenatal corticosteroids, differ from women who give birth within <b>seven</b> <b>days,</b> at < 34 weeks gestation. Objectives: To examine the differences, if any, between women who received a single course of prenatal corticosteroids and remained undelivered more than <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> later and women who gave birth within <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> of treatment, at < 34 weeks gestation. Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide. Population: Women who gave birth at < 34 weeks gestation from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1996. Methods: Data were extracted from medical records and retrieved from the hospital's database. Main potential predictors collected: Prenatal corticosteroid exposure, reason for risk of preterm birth, maternal demographics and previous and current obstetric history. Results: Of the 506 women, 122 (24 %) remained undelivered more than <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> following prenatal corticosteroid therapy. Initial corticosteroid treatment was given on average 1. 6 weeks earlier to women who remained undelivered more than <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> after treatment. Women who were given prenatal corticosteroids for placenta praevia (RR 6. 03, 95 % CI 2. 67 - 13. 61, p < 0. 01) or cervical incompetence (RR 3. 40, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 10. 95, p = 0. 04) {{were more likely to}} give birth more than <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> after corticosteroid treatment. Conclusions: Women who give birth very preterm, who remain undelivered more than <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> after prenatal corticosteroids, differ in the reasons for and timing of their first course from women who give birth within <b>seven</b> <b>days.</b> KJ McLaughlin, CA Crowther, P Vigneswaran, E Hancock, K Willso...|$|R
