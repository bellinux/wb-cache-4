6000|$|From any {{prolonged}} {{study of}} Browning's poetry we become conscious of certain dominant qualities of style {{that may be}} thought of quite apart from his themes or message. That his style has the defect of its qualities has already been pointed out. Here we may appropriately indicate those qualities as positive elements of his power. His diction, rich alike in the most learned words and the most colloquial, is responsive to all demands. His power of phrasing runs the whole gamut from the most pellucid simplicity to the most triumphant originality. His figures of speech, drawn from all realms, are penetrating in quality, of startling aptness. Equally characteristic is his versification, varying as it does from passages of melodic smoothness and grace to lines as strident, broken, and harsh as the thought they dramatically reflect. In narration, whether in the brilliant rapidity and ease of a short poem like [...] "Hervé Riel" [...] or in the <b>sustained</b> <b>flow</b> of a long story like that of Pompilia, we find unusual skill. In disquisition, in the presentation of complicated and elusive intellectual processes, there is a quite unmatched agility and dexterity. Probably no two forms of poetry contain more of Browning's most noteworthy work than the lyric, especially the reflective love lyric, and that form which is distinctively his own, the dramatic monologue. In his best poems in this last form he has no competitor. It is in the presentation of character {{through the medium of}} dramatic monologue that he most fully reveals the unerring precision of his analysis, his lightning glance into the heart of a mystery, the ease with which he tracks a motive or mood or thought to its last hiding place, and his consequent passion and fire of sympathy or scorn.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} modeling {{study of}} three non-producing deep geothermal wells from Cerro Prieto is presented. We compute the expected production characteristics of these wells {{in order to}} determine if their inability to <b>sustain</b> <b>flow</b> was due to (i) heat loss effects in the well, (ii) the influence of production casing diameters, (iii) the transient heat loss during {{the first few days of}} well discharge, or (ix) the effect of secondary low-enthalpy inflows. A new version of the wellbore flow simulator called GEOPOZO v 2. 0 was developed to solve the equations of conservation of mass, momentum and energy for esteady or transient one-and two-phase flow in geothermal wells. It was found that all three wells should have sustained production. The early heat losses were so large that the wells need to be induced and they would only <b>sustain</b> <b>flow</b> after several dayas of induced discharge. For well M- 202 the match between measured and computed temperature profiles for a secondary feedzone suggests that the inflow of colder waters was responsible for sopping the lfow of this well...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Flow-pressure {{curves and}} {{vascular}} impedance {{are commonly used}} to investigate pulmonary circulation, {{but they may be}} affected at low flow by reflex neurohumoral activation. We therefore investigated the mechanical effects and the reflex effects of decreased flow on pulmonary vascular resistance and impedance. Methods: In ten anaesthetized dogs, we compared flow-pressure curves generated in less than 10 s to prevent sympathetic activation (fast curves), or generated over 20 - 30 min to allow neurohumoral equilibration (slow curves), in hyperoxia (inspired oxygen, 40 %) and in hypoxia (inspired oxygen, 10 %), before and after adrenergic blockade by phentolamine and propranolol. Resistance was assessed from the flow-pressure relationship. Impedance was computed from instantaneous flow and pressure obtained with an ultrasonic flowmeter and a micromanometer-tipped catheter. Results: At baseline, fast flow-pressure curves were steeper and had a lower pressure intercept. Transient low flow did not affect heart rate or pulmonary arterial elastance. <b>Sustained</b> low <b>flow</b> increased heart rate, resistance and elastance, suggesting baroreceptor-induced sympathetic stimulation. After adrenergic blockade, no difference persisted between effects of transient and <b>sustained</b> low <b>flow.</b> In hypoxia, slow and fast flow-pressure curves were similar. Hypoxia increased heart rate and resistance but did not decrease elastance, suggesting chemoreceptor-induced sympathetic stimulation. In hypoxia, differences between transient and <b>sustained</b> low <b>flow</b> were no longer significant, and were completely suppressed by adrenergic blockade. In two additional dogs, epinephrine infusion increased pulmonary vascular resistance and elastance. Conclusions: We conclude that (1) compared to transient low <b>flow,</b> <b>sustained</b> low <b>flow</b> is associated with increases in distal resistance and proximal elastance due to sympathetic stimulation and (2) these differences between the effects of transient and <b>sustained</b> low <b>flow</b> do not persist in hypoxia, because of an already present chemoreceptor-induced sympathetic stimulation.

40|$|The {{total amount}} of water stored in a river basin affects streamflow at various {{timescales}} and defines the river basin's response to atmospheric forcing. For example, spring runoff in mountainous midlatitude catchments depends on winter snowpack, and groundwater storage <b>sustains</b> <b>flow</b> during dry periods. An accurate estimation of terrestrial water storage (TWS) is thus paramount for improved water management. Direct determination of TWS is difficult due to insufficient in situ data on space-time variability of hydrologic stores (snow, soil moisture, groundwater) and fluxes (precipitation, evapotranspiration). However, alternative methods using new data sets show great potential to improve the estimation of intra-annual and interannual TWS dynamic...|$|R

The unaveraged equations {{are used}} numerically {{in conjunction with}} tools and concepts from nonlinear dynamics, including time series, phase portraits, Poincare sections, largest Liapunov exponents, power spectra, and strange attractors. Initially neighboring solutions for a low Reynolds number fully developed turbulence are compared. Several flows are noted: fully chaotic, complex periodic, weakly chaotic, simple periodic, and fixed-point. Of these, only fully chaotic is classified as turbulent. Besides the <b>sustained</b> <b>flows,</b> a flow which decays as it becomes turbulent is examined. For the finest grid, 128 (exp 3) points, the spatial resolution appears to be quite good. As a final note, the variation of the velocity derivatives skewness of a Navier-Stokes flow as the Reynolds number goes to zero is calculated numerically. The value of the skewness is shown to become small at low Reynolds numbers, in agreement with intuitive arguments that nonlinear terms should be negligible...|$|R

5000|$|Within {{minutes after}} the 1929 Grand Banks {{earthquake}} occurred {{off the coast of}} Newfoundland, transatlantic telephone cables began breaking sequentially, farther and farther downslope, away from the epicenter. Twelve cables were snapped in a total of 28 places. Exact times and locations were recorded for each break. Investigators suggested that an estimated 60 mile per hour (100 km/h) submarine landslide or turbidity current of water saturated sediments swept 400 miles (600 km) down the continental slope from the earthquake’s epicenter, snapping the cables as it passed. [...] Subsequent research of this event have shown that continental slope sediment failures mostly occurred below 650 meter water depth. [...] The slumping that occurred in shallow waters (5-25 meters) passed down slope into turbidity currents that evolved ignitively. The turbidity currents had <b>sustained</b> <b>flow</b> for many hours due to the delayed retrogressive failure and transformation of debris flows into turbidity currents through hydraulic jumps.|$|E

40|$|Field {{evidence}} {{points to}} localization of magma flowing in a Tertiary doleritic sill on the Isle of Mull, Inner Hebrides, Scotland. Regions of the sill in which flow was short-lived have chilled margins, a narrow or absent metamorphic aureole, and alignment of plagioclase crystals resulting in pronounced, flow-parallel, lineations on fracture surfaces (Type I regions). Prolonged flow resulted in blocky, coarse-grained dolerite with no chilled margins, and an extensive metamorphic aureole (Type II regions). The distribution of Type I and Type II regions shows no spatial pattern, with stagnant solidifying sections immediately adjacent to sections with contemporaneous active and <b>sustained</b> <b>flow.</b> The transition between Type I and Type II regions occurs as the sill thickness exceeds 35 m. Our observation that <b>sustained</b> <b>flow</b> was only possible in regions of the sill thicker than 3. 5 m is consistent with previously published theoretical models which predict a critical sill thick-ness in the range 22 [...] 5 m. Regions of the sill narrower than this experienced a single injection of magma.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{recognition}} of the important role that groundwater may have in buffering changes in river discharge due to increased melting of glaciers. Glacial deposits, particularly proglacial deposits and outwash plains can form significant aquifers and contain groundwater stores that are rarely quantified. In addition, interaction of basal melting of glaciers with groundwater can help to <b>sustain</b> <b>flow</b> through prolonged cold winters. The multidisciplinary BGS observatory at Virkisjökull in Iceland provides an excellent opportunity to characterise and quantify glacial meltwaters and groundwater. Glacier meltwater has been measured since September 2011, and precipitation and temperature from weather stations at varying altitudes since September 2009. Meltwaters and groundwater in the proglacial environment have been sampled periodically and analysed for inorganic chemistry, CFC, SF 6 and stable isotopes to help understand the origin and flow paths of meltwaters and groundwater. The proglacial deposits have been mapped and the permeability of targeted deposits characterised. Initial findings show that the outwash plain provides a significant highly permeable aquifer, and is recharged locally from precipitation, with a growing influence of meltwater close to the meltwater channel. Shallow groundwater from snow melt within the catchment provides significant flow to the meltwater channels in spring, but in the prolonged winter, basal meltwater, possibly linked with sub glacial groundwater, helps to <b>sustain</b> <b>flow</b> in the meltwater channels. This initial study {{has led to the}} design of a more detailed experiment in the summer of 2012 involving the drilling and instrumentation of a targeted network of piezometers across the sandur and proglacial area. ...|$|R
