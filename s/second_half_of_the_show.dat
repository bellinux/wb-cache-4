Hollywood luminaries such as actors John Garfield and Mickey Rooney {{invested in the}} production, and Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles offered to direct. At one performance though, Garfield insisted Herb Jeffries, who was light-skinned, should wear make-up. Ellington objected in the interval, and compared Jeffries to Al Jolson. The change was reverted, and the singer later commented that the audience must have thought he was an entirely different character in the <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b>|$|E
500|$|On February 6, 1991, [...] "The Jacket" [...] {{was first}} {{broadcast}} in the United States on NBC. It gained a Nielsen rating of 10.4 and an audience share of 16, {{this means that}} 10.4% of American households watched the episode, and that 16% of all televisions in use {{at the time were}} tuned into it. It faced strong competition from the CBS crime drama Jake and the Fatman; viewers would frequently tune out of Seinfeld to watch the second half of Jake and the Fatmans.

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{wrote that}} the episode [...] "came close to {{fulfilling}} [...] potential, {{but was unable to}} keep the rapid-fire comedic pace going for the entire episode."

[...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide thought that the [...] "unexpected treat this week was guest star James Carville, who's presence as confidant to Jack not only made sense, but Carville also {{had a lot of fun}} lampooning himself 'Cajun style' and all.

500|$|All {{countries}} {{except the}} [...] "Big 5" [...] (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) {{and the host}} country, were required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order {{to compete for the}} final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progressed to the final. The European Broadcasting Union split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 20 January 2014, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. The Netherlands was placed into the first semi-final, to be held on 6 May 2014, and was scheduled to perform in the <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b>|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have enjoyed}} the series' story and writing. Santos enjoyed how Steins;Gate misleads the viewer by {{spending}} {{the first half}} of the series on comedy before turning into a thriller for the second half, and how the finale revisits the events of the first episode, making for a [...] "rock-solid climax". Rebecca Silverman at Anime News Network called the pacing of the first half uneven, with exciting scientific discoveries coupled with less interesting sequences about daily life in the laboratory and maid café visits, but found the <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> to be a step up; she enjoyed the added urgency, and how the characters were given development and how the viewer was given insight into their motivations from {{the first half of}} the series. Similarly, Aiden Foote at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews said that the first half, while entertaining, is lacking in direction. Eisenbeis noted the rules for how time travel works as well defined, which he called among the hardest things to do when writing time travel fiction. Pierce Drew at The Fandom Post enjoyed the story and characters, but noted that Luka adds very little to the story.|$|E
500|$|During the Heads of Delegations {{meeting in}} Malta on 30 September 2014, the {{broadcaster}} PBS {{along with the}} production team sought permission to change the running order rule, which was to allow the artists to randomly select their position number (a system used in 2013). [...] The agreed change was for the host country, Malta, to pick their position at random, followed by countries that were to open and close the show to be picked randomly. [...] The remaining countries would then select at random whether they were to perform in the first or <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> [...] This draw {{took place during the}} opening ceremony, at the Verdala Palace on 9 November 2013. [...] A pre-draw to decide the order in which countries would select their running order halves, took place on 7 November 2014, hosted by Moira Delia, Vladislav Yakovlev, and Gaia Cauchi. [...] PBS and the production team then decided the running order so that they could avoid similar entries performing consecutively. [...] This method has been used in the senior contests since [...] [...] The Executive Supervisor along with the Steering Group presented the finalised running order shortly after the opening ceremony.|$|E

2500|$|The series {{began at}} a time when {{violence}} on television was under intense scrutiny. As a result, Wonder Woman was less frequently seen punching or kicking people the way she did in the early episodes. She would usually be shown pushing and throwing enemies or using creativity to get them to somehow knock themselves out (such as jumping high into the air to cause pursuers to collide). Despite the wartime setting, she almost never resorted to deadly force. The only exception occurs in the pilot episode when she sinks a German U-boat by crashing an airplane into it, presumably killing everyone aboard. [...] Wonder Woman herself was occasionally overpowered by chloroform and poison gas, but she always came back in the <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> to save the day. In some episodes, her enemies learn the secret of her superhuman strength – her magic belt – and temporarily steal it, leaving her with average human strength. Her indestructible lasso and bracelets were stolen or taken away in one episode (leaving her defenseless against gunfire), but Wonder Woman recovered them {{by the end of the}} episode. (In the comics, Wonder Woman's bracelets were welded onto her forearms, and she would lose most of her strength if men were to join them forcibly with metal.) ...|$|E
