5|$|From Alaska to Northern California, coastal {{cutthroat}} trout in sea-run, resident stream and lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run {{cutthroat trout}} fishing with its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run cutthroat trout along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines. In {{addition to a}} cutthroat trout <b>sport</b> <b>fishery</b> managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal cutthroat trout subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.|$|E
25|$|Another major area {{of concern}} for the DFG was water flow. By mid-July each year, snowpack in the {{mountains}} (the major source of water for the Smith River) had completely melted away. Combined with irrigation in the upper Smith River, this meant that water levels on the Smith were too low by mid-summer to support recreational boating or floating. Low water levels also hurt the <b>sport</b> <b>fishery,</b> but although DFG attempted to secure additional water rights these efforts largely failed over the next 20 years. In 1974, DFG abandoned its attempt to manage the Smith River as a <b>sport</b> <b>fishery,</b> and instead began implementing a wild trout fishery management plan. This meant stocking only native fish, as needed, and no more stocking of nonnative sport fish.|$|E

25|$|The Smith River is an {{excellent}} <b>sport</b> <b>fishery.</b> Sport fish include brown trout, rainbow trout, and whitefish. Other species widely fished in the area include brook trout, burbot (also known as ling), and cutthroat trout. Non-game fish which may also be caught include longnose dace, longnose sucker, mottled sculpin, mountain sucker, stonecat, and white sucker. Nonnative carp were present as late as 1995, but have been removed as of 2009.|$|E
25|$|Notably in Britain and Ireland, pike {{are greatly}} admired as a {{sporting}} fish {{and they are}} returned alive to the water to safeguard future sport and maintain the balance of a fishery. The Pike Anglers Club has campaigned to preserve pike since 1977, arguing that the removal of pike from waters can lead to an explosion of smaller fish, and to ensure pike removal stops, which is damaging to both the <b>sport</b> <b>fishery</b> and the environment.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{populations have}} been {{established}} in all the Great Lakes. Coho stocks were planted {{by the state of}} Michigan in the late 1960s to control the growing population of non-native alewife. Now Chinook (king), Atlantic, and coho (silver) salmon are annually stocked in all Great Lakes by most bordering states and provinces. These populations are not self-sustaining and do not provide {{much in the way of}} a commercial fishery, but have led to the development of a thriving <b>sport</b> <b>fishery.</b>|$|E

25|$|Lake Michigan {{is home to}} a {{wide variety}} of fish species and other organisms. It was {{originally}} home to lake whitefish, lake trout, yellow perch, panfish, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and bowfin, as well as some species of catfish. As a result of improvements to the Welland Canal in 1919, an invasion of sea lampreys and overharvesting, there has been a decline in native lake trout populations, ultimately causing an increase in the population of another invasive species, the alewife. As a result, salmonids, including various strains of brown trout, steelhead (rainbow trout), coho and chinook salmon, were introduced as predators in order to decrease the alewife population. This program was so successful that the introduced population of trout and salmon exploded, resulting in the creation of a large <b>sport</b> <b>fishery</b> for these introduced species. Lake Michigan is now stocked annually with steelhead, brown trout, and coho and chinook salmon, which have also begun natural reproduction in some Lake Michigan tributaries. However, several introduced invasive species, such as lampreys, round goby, zebra mussels and quagga mussels, continue to cause major changes in water clarity and fertility, resulting in knock-on changes to Lake Michigan's ecosystem, threatening the vitality of native fish populations.|$|E
500|$|American {{paddlefish}} {{populations have}} declined dramatically, {{primarily as a}} result of overfishing and habitat destruction. [...] In 2004 they were listed as Vulnerable (VU A3de ver 3.1) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. [...] They are currently proposed for listing as VU 3de throughout their range {{as the result of a}} U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service assessment. [...] The assessment concluded that [...] "an overall population size reduction of at least 30% may occur within the next 10 years or three generations due to actual or potential levels of exploitation and the effects of introduced taxa, pollutants, competitors or parasites." [...] American paddlefish are filter-feeding pelagic fish that require large, free-flowing rivers with braided channels, backwater areas, oxbow lakes that are rich in zooplankton, and gravel bars for spawning. [...] Series of dams on rivers such as those constructed on the Missouri River have impounded large populations of American paddlefish, and blocked their upstream migration to spawning shoals. Channelization and groynes or wing dykes have caused the narrowing of rivers and altered flow, destroying crucial spawning and nursery habitat. [...] As a result, most impounded populations are not self-sustaining and must be stocked to maintain a viable <b>sport</b> <b>fishery.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{artificial}} propagation of American paddlefish {{began with the}} efforts of the Missouri Department of Conservation during the early 1960s, and focused primarily on maintenance of the <b>sport</b> <b>fishery.</b> [...] However, it was the growing importance of American paddlefish for their meat and roe that became the catalyst for further development of culture techniques for aquaculture in the United States. [...] Artificial propagation requires broodstock which, because of the late sexual maturation of American paddlefish, are initially obtained from the wild and brought into a hatchery environment. [...] The fish are injected with LH-RH hormone to stimulate spawning. [...] The number of eggs a female may produce depends {{on the size of the}} fish and can range anywhere from 70,000â€“300,000 eggs. [...] Unlike most teleosts, the oviduct branches of American paddlefish and sturgeons are not directly attached to the ovaries; rather, they open dorsally into the body cavity. [...] To determine the status of progression toward maturation, ova staging is performed. [...] The process begins with a minor procedure that involves a small abdominal incision from which to extract a few sample oocytes. [...] The oocytes are boiled in water for a few minutes until the yolk is hardened, and then they are cut in half to expose the nucleus. [...] The exposed nucleus is examined under a microscope to determine stage of maturity.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1960s and 1970s, the {{increased}} pollution caused frequent algal blooms {{to occur in}} the summer. These blooms killed large numbers of fish, and left decomposing piles of filamentous algae and dead fish along the shores. At times the blooms became so thick that waves could not break. Fish eating birds such as osprey, bald eagle and cormorant were being poisoned by contaminated fish. Since the 1960s and 1970s, environmental concerns have forced a cleanup of industrial and municipal wastes. Cleanup has been accomplished through better treatment plants, tighter environmental regulations, deindustrialization and increased public awareness. [...] Today, Lake Ontario has recovered some of its pristine quality; for example, walleye, a fish species considered as a marker of clean water, are now found. However, regional airshed pollution remains a concern. The lake has also become an important <b>sport</b> <b>fishery,</b> although with introduced species (Coho and Chinook salmon) rather than the native species. Bald eagle and osprey populations are also beginning to recover.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{fishing is}} now {{predominantly}} based in Canadian communities, {{with a much}} smaller fisheryâ€”largely restricted to yellow perchâ€”in Ohio. One account suggested that Canadian fishermen are [...] "still at it and making money" [...] and they [...] "know how to fish" [...] by [...] "using the old nets." [...] The Ontario fishery {{is one of the}} most intensively managed in the world. However, there are reports that some Canadian commercial fishermen are dissatisfied with fishing quotas, and have sued their government about this matter, and there have been complaints that the legislative body writing the quotas is [...] "dominated by the U.S." [...] and that sport fishing interests are favored at the expense of commercial fishing interests. Cuts of 30 to 45 percent for certain fish were made in 2007. The Lake Erie fishery was one of the first fisheries in the world managed on individual transferable quotas and features mandatory daily catch reporting and intensive auditing of the catch reporting system. Still, the commercial fishery is the target of critics who would like to see the lake managed for the exclusive benefit of sport fishing and the various industries serving the <b>sport</b> <b>fishery.</b> In November 2010, Ontario's oldest and largest fish processor known as Great Lakes Fish Corporation was shut down after operating for a hundred years; 130 workers were laid off and numerous spinoff jobs disappeared, such as jobs at local restaurants and net repair shops. According to one report, the Canadian town of Port Dover is the home of the lake's largest fishing fleet, and the town features miniature golf, dairy bars, French-fry stands, and restaurants serving perch.|$|E

2500|$|The lake also {{supports}} a strong <b>sport</b> <b>fishery.</b> While commercial fishing declined, sport fishing has remained. The deep cool waters that spawn the best fishing {{is in the}} Canadian side of the lake. As a result, a fishing boat that crosses the international border triggers the security concerns of border crossings and fishermen are advised to have their passport. If their boat crosses the invisible border line in the lake, upon returning to the American shore, passengers will have to [...] "drive to a local government reporting station and pose for pictures" [...] to Customs officers by videophone. There are cumbersome rules for fishing boat operators as well, {{who will have to}} fax passenger personal information to a government agency an hour before leaving; officers will be watching and doing spot checks from patrol boats and government aircraft". Authorities in 2008 from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission have tried stocking the lake with brown trout in an effort to build what's called a put-grow-and-take fishery. There was a report that charter boat fishing increased substantially on the American side, from 46 to 638 charter boats in operation in Ohio alone, during a period from 1975 to 1985 as pollution levels declined, and after populations of walleye increased substantially in the lake. In 1984, Ohio sold 27,000 nonresident fishing permits, and sport fishing was described as big business. In 1992, there were accounts of fishermen catching 8, 10, and 12 pound walleyes, and that the [...] "runt of a five-man daily limit of 25 walleye might be a nuisance of 5 pounds." [...] It is possible to fish off piers in winter for a fish called the burbot, also known by pseudonyms such as eelpout, mudblow, lawyer fish, cusk, or freshwater cod which looks [...] "ugly" [...] but tastes great; the burbot make a midwinter spawning run and is reportedly one of [...] "Erie's glacial relics." ...|$|E
