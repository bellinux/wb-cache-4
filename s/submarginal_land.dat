50|$|The area {{attracted}} homesteaders in {{the late}} 19th century who ditched, drained, plowed, and grazed the land. Overuse caused a decline in productivity that was exacerbated by the drought of the 1930s. The U.S. government purchased <b>submarginal</b> <b>lands</b> in 1937. The lands were then administered by the Soil Conservation Service (now the Natural Resources Conservation Service) which began stabilizing the land by planting of over 4000 acre of crested wheatgrass. In the 1940s {{a portion of the}} area was used as bombing range. Grazing of the land continued until its designation as a National Grassland in 1991.|$|R
40|$|Using {{data from}} villages in three districts of Western Rajasthan, this paper {{describes}} the decline in area and deterioration in quality of common property resources over three decades. The decline of common property resources is associated with institutional changes in the villages. The introduction of land reforms in the early 1950 s led to large-scale privatization of common property resources, reduced the private cost of use of common property resources, and slackened their upkeep by disrupting the traditional management system. Increased commercialization of livestock farming, increased use of tractors, and demographic pressure also played roles in the process. Farmers adjusted to shrinking common property resources by reducing herd size, by changing its composition, and by relying more on private resources to rear animals. These changes tend to reduce the comparative advantage of livestock farming in the arid region. Since the shrinkage of common property resources is largely {{a result of the}} transfer of <b>submarginal</b> <b>lands</b> from grazing to cropping, resource degradation is accelerated...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} the New Deal conservation policy that took root during the 1930 s {{played an important role}} in changing how farmers approached their land and their government during the 1930 s and beyond. The severity of the depression and devastation wrought by the Dust Bowl forced agriculturalists to reconsider how they used the land because the crises exposed the fragility of the rural economy and the problems caused by farming <b>submarginal</b> <b>lands.</b> Many farmers utilized New Deal programs, agencies, and funding to practice conservation, mitigate the Great Depression, and rehabilitate their lands. The system of county agents proved vital to this process, as agents in rural counties helped locals navigate the complexities of an ever-expanding state, serving as interlocutors between federal experts and farmers. It shows that farmers acted pragmatically - participating in programs they found worthwhile, designing alternatives, and capitalizing on federal largesse. Indeed, local farmers helped build the New Deal conservation state through just such engagement. In the aftermath of the drought, altered circumstances did little to disrupt the new coziness between growers and their tax-payer funded benefactor. World War II actually cemented that relationship, when the government responded to Coloradans 2 ̆ 7 requests for outside labor by importing Braceros and Jamaican workers, by using German prisoners of war, and by establishing work contracts for prisoners from the Amache Japanese American incarceration camp. This contract labor, which local farmers deemed necessary to augment a labor pool depleted by migration and relocation, boosted wartime production dramatically. In addition, the influx of cheap and readily available labor combined with improved weather to allow farmers to maximize production and capitalize on wartime prices, setting the stage for the development of agribusiness in postwar America...|$|R
5000|$|The FSA {{stressed}} [...] "rural rehabilitation" [...] {{efforts to}} improve the lifestyle of sharecroppers, tenants, very poor landowning farmers, and a program to purchase <b>submarginal</b> <b>land</b> owned by poor farmers and resettle them in group farms on land more suitable for efficient farming. Critics, including the Farm Bureau, strongly opposed the FSA as an experiment in collectivizing agriculture—that is, in bringing farmers together to work on large government-owned farms using modern techniques under the supervision of experts. After the Conservative coalition took control of Congress it transformed the FSA into a program to help poor farmers buy land, and that program continues to operate in the 21st century as the Farmers Home Administration.|$|E
40|$|In this {{sophisticated}} reinterpretation, Sarah T. Phillips {{traces the}} history and impact of New Deal conservation policy. She argues persuasively that rural conservation programs deserve a prominent place in New Deal historiography because they significantly shaped the New Deal state and because they were integral to the New Deal 2 ̆ 7 s campaign for economic recovery. Her work is sufficiently broad and innovative to invite criticism at multiple points on evidentiary grounds, but the book is consistently engaging. Phillips shows that during the 1920 s, eastern land use planners and politicians, along with progressives in the USDA, advocated planned and coordinated use of natural resources, scientific farming, and {{soil and water conservation}} as ways of enhancing rural Americans 2 ̆ 7 standard of living. America 2 ̆ 7 s openness to change during the Depression offered these reformers the chance to implement their ideas through programs that included the Tennessee Valley Authority, <b>submarginal</b> <b>land</b> retirement, and rural resettlement. After Plains residents balked at the notion that their land was submarginal, though, New Dealers moderated their approach and emphasized rehabilitation in place...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} plant {{succession}} has contributed {{more than any}} other single line of investigation to a deeper insight into the nature of vegetation. Earlier studies of succession, especially in grassland, were largely those of the primary sere. But with the utilization of the prairies for grazing, and the abandonment of <b>submarginal</b> <b>land</b> after a short period of cropping, numerous investigations of secondary successions were made. The earlier studies have been discussed by Clements (1916) in 2 ̆ 2 Plant Succession. 2 ̆ 2 Sampson 2 ̆ 7 s plant succession in relation to range management appeared in 1919. Many of the more recent investigations of subseres in grassland and on abandoned lands have been reviewed by Drew (1942). Costello (1944) has studied the grassland subsere in northeastern Colorado. Weaver and Albertson (1944) have traced the subsere following the recent great drought over a vast central area of both true and mixed prairie. Information on the rate and nature of natural re-vegetation of depleted ranges and abandoned cultivated land is of basic importance to many problems of soil conservation and land use...|$|E
40|$|Vast {{areas of}} central Saskatchewan are {{occupied}} by aspen groves, aspen forest and mixed-wood (Rowe, 1959). A {{part of the}} aspen forest has been cleared and is now utilized as pastures. These pastures may {{be referred to as}} 'wooded', 'bushland' or 'northern wooded' pastures. Though, historically, the utilization of the wooded pastures {{can be traced back to}} the times of early settlers, their development as government sponsored pasture dates back to the early 1940 's. While the first government community pasture in the grassland zone was established in 1922 at Matador (Moen, 1964), it was not until 1941 that a community pasture was set up at Beaver Hills in the forest zone. By the early 1950 's it became obvious that the livestock industry was being greatly hampered by insufficient grazing facilities. The pastures in the grassland region could not cope with the increasing demand for grazing needs due to low carrying capacity as a result of frequent droughts. In the northern fringe of settlement there were still present vast areas of unutilized <b>submarginal</b> <b>lands</b> under aspen forest. The soil under aspen forest is podzolic, often low in fertility, of sandy texture, stony and poorly drained in low lying areas so that its tillage for cereal crops was not feasible. The importance of wooded pastures would further increase with the rising demand of beef production. Haase (1964) has outlined the need and importance of increased forage production in Canada. He suggested that an additional 15 million acres of improved land would be needed by 1980. The investigators in various fields discussed effectively the problems and needed fields of study in the establishment of northern wooded pastures in a meeting on "The development of pasture from bushlands in western Canada" under the auspecies of Canada Department of Agriculture in 1964. Perhaps, the most important aspect of the problems that were discussed at the meeting, was the need for understanding the response of vegetation, native as well as seeded, to grazing. The present study was undertaken primarily to consider the effect of grazing on herbaceous vegetation in wooded pastures. This involved the selection and study of comparable grazed and ungrazed stands under three different 'habitat' types: forest; forest, cleared; and forest, cleared, ploughed and seeded. The study sites were located in areas, potentially capable of supporting aspen forest on podzolic, degraded black or grey wooded soil. Populus tremuloides is the dominant tree species and Fragaria vesca, Lathyrus venosus, Vicia americana, Aster ciliolatus, Galium septentrionale, Thalictrum dasycarpum, Bromus ciliatus, Agropyron subsecundum and Schizachne purpurascens are the common herb species in undisturbed sites. Poa pratensis and Poa palustris are the dominant grasses in cleared areas while Bromus inermis, Agropyron cristatum and Medicago sativa are the most common species in seeded areas...|$|R
40|$|Groundnut is an {{important}} crop around the globe for its nutritional and trade values. As a result of diverse farming situations, {{there is a large}} variation in the productivity levels of groundnut around the world. In countries such as USA where the crop is grown on large farms with assured inputs, productivity levels are very high in comparison to a country such as India where the crop is traditionally grown by small-holding farmers, on less fertile soil, in rainfed conditions, with low inputs. In 1998, although the groundnut area in China was about half of that in India, the production exceeded that of India by nearly 10 %. Groundnut productivity in India is low due to moisture stress, poor soil fertility, pests and diseases, and low inputs, and cultivation of the crop on marginal and <b>submarginal</b> <b>lands.</b> Nearly 80 % of the area sown to groundnuts in India is rainfed and relies entirely on summer monsoon rainfall. The rainfall in most of the groundnut-growing regions is low and erratic. There is a high variability in the onset of monsoons, annual rainfall, and distribution of rainfall over the growing season. Moreover, such high variability in precipitation is generally associated with a high probability of an early season drought. Thus, rainfed agriculture in India is a risky proposition. One of the decision-making problems confronting the farmers {{at the onset of the}} cropping season is choice of an optimum sowing window. With the above in view, a research project was undertaken at ICRISAT to examine the trends in groundnut production in India over the past few decades in the global context, characterize the groundnut production environment of the Anantapur region, and to provide a first approximation "decision support system" to the farmers of the Anantapur region in the state of Andhra Pradesh and thus aid them in deciding an optimum "time window" for sowing the groundnut crop. The first section examines the trends in world groundnut area, production, and productivity from 1961 to 1998. Similar trends for China and India, the world's leading groundnut producers, are also analyzed. As an example of precision agriculture, the area and production trends in USA are discussed. The second section takes a closer look at the groundnut production scenario in India. In the third section, groundnut production environment in the Anantapur region (the target benchmark region chosen for this research activity) is characterized, and constraints to sustainable production are identified. The results of groundnut yield simulations using CROPGRO-Peanut model and historical weather data from the Anantapur region are presented in the fourth section. The report is summarized and relevant inferences are drawn from the results of this research activity in the fifth section. A first approximation decision support system for choosing an optimum "time window" for sowing the crop in the region based on model simulation results and rainfall probabilities is also presented. In view of the findings of the project, a research project that aims to enhance and sustain groundnut productivity in India is proposed in the last section...|$|R
40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1932, dust clouds swept over {{portions}} of the southern Great Plains. For the next six years, drought and the prevailing winds wreaked havoc over fifty million acres across northeastern New Mexico, southeastern Colorado, western Kansas, and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma-an area known by 1935 as the Dust Bowl. Much of that acreage was submarginal-land that, given the price of wheat, did not merit cultivation-and it was easily windblown. Tillage with one-way disk plows pulverized the powder-dry soil, and the nearly constant winds blew and drifted it across crop and grasslands. During {{the remainder of the}} decade, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other government agencies struggled to halt wind erosion and to restore the land in the Dust Bowl. Their work mandated the development of a federal land policy that would enable government officials to help farmers reclaim their wind-eroded lands. Recognition of the need for a new federal land policy, however, was not new. For nearly a decade social scientists, such as L. C. Gray in the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the USDA, had urged a comprehensive land-use program that would remove <b>submarginal</b> <b>land</b> from production to help solve the joint problems of surplus production and soil erosion. And in 1931 Gray influenced the Hoover administration to call a national conference on land utilization. When the delegates from the land-grant colleges, farm organizations, and the federal government met in Chicago in November, they too called for a national land-use program that included the federal purchase of submarginal lands...|$|E
40|$|In New England, {{and along}} the stretch of {{coastline}} which starts just south of Canada and goes down through New Jersey, we have half a dozen major or what we call international airports. All but two have bird problems. Most of these airports were built on <b>submarginal</b> <b>land,</b> but what was {{perhaps some of the}} best wildlife habitat in the country. So, the birds were there first. When these airports were built, airlines were flying propeller-type aircraft. This type was slow and sluggish compared to the jet aircraft of today. Even though aircraft speeds have increased, the birds still are using their habitual flight paths and feeding in the marshes and mud flats. But, they just cannot move fast enough to get away from these airplanes. So, perhaps this is how a lot of the incidents started. Prior to 1960, the office out of which I then worked was not too deeply in¬volved with bird problems at airports. We had a few static problems like maintenance hangars, shops, and things of this nature [...] but we had not become involved in any major bird-aircraft hazard situations. In 1960, however, 60 people did not survive a plane crash in the Boston Harbor. So, {{all of a sudden we}} were involved clear up to our necks. And believe me, we didn 2 ̆ 7 t know exactly what to do! A mad scramble took place and a lot of 2 ̆ 2 specialists 2 ̆ 2 were put on the problem. Immediately a set of recommendations were drawn up and put into use. A lot of quick mowing was done and various scaring devices, such as noise-makers, were put into use. This resulted in a major drop in bird numbers at the airport. And since that time, there has not been a major crash at the Logan International Airport at Boston, Massachusetts...|$|E
