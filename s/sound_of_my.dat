In order to ensure the authenticity of the sequence, Armitage was himself subjected to the actual torture while shooting. He agreed to perform the sequence after he was convinced by consultants for the FSB and CIA. Armitage was only subjected to it for a short time, and was filmed in slow motion to make it appear he was on for longer. The ambient temperature of the room was also raised to make him as comfortable as possible. However, after the sequence was shot, Armitage changed his opinion entirely, stating; [...] "I only lasted five to ten seconds, and the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> voice crying out to stop isn't me acting."

500|$|The {{producers}} {{allow the}} cast to perform {{many of their}} own stunts. In filming fight sequences, they were carefully choreographed beforehand so the actors could participate themselves. The guns featured on the series are real. In scenes where guns are included, an armourer is on hand throughout {{the entirety of the}} sequence to see if the actors are handling them properly and gives out the guns to the actors at the last possible second before filming. After the sequence is shot, the guns have to be returned and locked in a case to prevent anybody from playing with them, even if the guns are not loaded. Among other stunt work, Armitage was asked to be subjected to an actual waterboarding scene to ensure the authenticity of the sequence.

2500|$|Jones pairing with Billy Sherrill at Epic Records {{came as a}} {{surprise}} to many; Sherrill and business partner Glenn Sutton are regarded as the defining influences of the countrypolitan sound, a smooth amalgamation of pop and country music that was popular during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, a far cry from George's honky tonk roots. [...] Despite a shaky start, the success that Sherrill had with Jones proved to be his most enduring; although Billboard chart statistics show that Sherrill had his biggest commercial successes with artists such as Wynette and Charlie Rich, with Jones Sherrill had his most longest-lasting association. [...] In Sherrill, Jones found what Andrew Meuller of Uncut described as [...] "the producer capable of creating the epically lachrymose arrangements his voice deserved and his torment demanded...He summoned for Jones the symphonies of sighing strings that almost made the misery of albums like 1974's The Grand Tour and 1976's Alone Again sound better than happiness could possibly feel." [...] In 1974, they scored a number one hit with the instant classic [...] "The Grand Tour" [...] and followed that with [...] "The Door" [...] (I've heard the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dear old mother cryin'/and the sound of the train that took me off to war), another number one smash. [...] Unlike most singers, who might have been overwhelmed by the string arrangements and background vocalists Sherrill sometimes employed on his records, Jones' voice, with its at times frightening intensity and lucid tone, could stand up to anything. [...] While Jones wrote fewer songs himself - songwriters had been tripping over themselves pitching songs to him for years - he still managed to co-write several, such as [...] "What My Woman Can't Do" [...] (also recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis), [...] "A Drunk Can't Be A Man", the harrowing [...] "I Just Don't Give a Damn" [...] (perhaps the greatest [...] "lost classic" [...] in the entire Jones catalogue) and [...] "These Days (I Barely Get By)", which he had written with Wynette.|$|E
