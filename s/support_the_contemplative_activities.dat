He has written numerous encyclopedia articles and annotated textual entries for the Encyclopedia of Religion (Macmillian Reference, 2004) and Religions of Tibet in Practice (Princeton University Press, 1997). He has also been involved with numerous documentary works on traditional Tibetan arts, including the 2004 documentary Tibetan Furniture Making: Traditions and Innovations, produced for the Pacific Asian Art Museum in Los Angeles, CA. In 2014, Germano was the keynote speaker for the Mind and Life Institute conference [...] "Contemplation in Contexts: Tibetan Buddhist Meditation Across the Boundaries of the Humanities and Sciences." [...] Recently, Germano's work as Director of <b>the</b> <b>Contemplative</b> Sciences Center has allowed him to coordinate the interests of numerous innovators, researchers, and scholars to investigate <b>the</b> benefits of <b>contemplative</b> <b>activities.</b> In this context, he has led a larger effort {{to think about the}} nature and future of a large public research university {{in the context of the}} transformative possibilities offered by contemplative practices, ideas, and values. Germano has also used this position to bring an increasing academic rigor as well as an acknowledgment of the foundational importance of culture to discussions of meditation and contemplation.|$|R

Meditation serves as a foundation on which <b>the</b> <b>contemplative</b> life stands, <b>the</b> practice by which someone begins the state of contemplation. In <b>contemplative</b> prayer, this <b>activity</b> is curtailed, so that contemplation has been described as [...] "a gaze of faith", [...] "a silent love".|$|R

50|$|The author {{described}} the Therapeutae in De vita contemplativa ("On <b>the</b> <b>contemplative</b> life"), {{written in the}} first century A.D. (C.E.) The origins of the Therapeutae were unclear, and Philo was even unsure about the etymology of their name, which he explained as meaning either physicians of souls or servants of God. The opening phrases of his essay establish that it followed one that has been lost, on the active life. Philo was employing the familiar polarity in Hellenic philosophy between the active and <b>the</b> <b>contemplative</b> life, exemplifying <b>the</b> active life by the Essenes, another severely ascetic sect, and <b>the</b> <b>contemplative</b> life by <b>the</b> desert-dwelling Therapeutae.|$|R
