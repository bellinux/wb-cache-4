50|$|Both {{bulk and}} surface <b>silicon</b> <b>micromachining</b> {{are used in}} the {{industrial}} production of sensors, ink-jet nozzles, and other devices. But in many cases the distinction between these two has diminished. A new etching technology, deep reactive-ion etching, has made it possible to combine good performance typical of bulk micromachining with comb structures and in-plane operation typical of surface micromachining. While it is common in surface micromachining to have structural layer thickness in the range of 2 µm, in HAR <b>silicon</b> <b>micromachining</b> the thickness can be from 10 to 100 µm. The materials commonly used in HAR <b>silicon</b> <b>micromachining</b> are thick polycrystalline silicon, known as epi-poly, and bonded silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers although processes for bulk silicon wafer also have been created (SCREAM). Bonding a second wafer by glass frit bonding, anodic bonding or alloy bonding is used to protect the MEMS structures. Integrated circuits are typically not combined with HAR <b>silicon</b> <b>micromachining.</b>|$|E

40|$|There has {{recently}} been renewed interest {{in the development of}} instrumentation for making measurements on the surface of Mars. This is due to the Mars Environmental Survey (MESUR) Mission, for which approximately 16 small, long-lived (2 - 10 years), relatively inexpensive surface stations will be deployed in a planet-wide network. This will allow the investigation of processes (such as seismology and meteorology) which require the simultaneous measurement of phenomena at many widely spaced locations on the surface over a considerable length of time. Due to the large number of vehicles involved, the mass, power, and cost of the payload will be severely constrained. A seismometer has been identified as one of the highest priority instruments in the MESUR straw-man payload. The requirements for an effective seismic experiment on Mars place a number of constraints on any viable sensor design. First, a large number of sensors must be deployed in a long-lived global network {{in order to be able}} to locate many events reliably, provide good spatial sampling of the interior, and increase the probability of seismic detection in the event of localized seismicity and/or high attenuation. From a practical standpoint, this means that individual surface stations will necessarily be constrained in terms of cost, mass, and power. Landing and thermal control systems will probably be simple, in order to minimize cost, resulting in large impact accelerations and wide daily and seasonal thermal swings. The level of seismic noise will determine the maximum usable sensitivity for seismometer. Unfortunately, the ambient seismic noise level for Mars is not well known. However lunar seismic noise levels are several orders of magnitude below that of the Earth. Sensitivities on the order of 10 (exp - 11) g over a bandwidth of. 04 to 20 Hz are thought to be necessary to fulfill the science objectives for a seimometer placed on the Martian surface. <b>Silicon</b> <b>micromachined</b> sensor technology offers techniques for the fabrication of monolithic, robust, compact, lower power and mass accelerometers.

40|$|This letter {{reports for}} the first time on a very low loss <b>silicon</b> <b>micromachined</b> {{waveguide}} technology, implemented for the frequency band of 220 – 325 GHz. The waveguide is realized by utilizing a double H-plane split in a three-wafer stack. This ensures very low surface roughness, in particular on the top and bottom surfaces of the waveguide, without the use of any surface roughness reduction processing steps. This is superior to previous micromachined waveguide concepts, including E-plane and single H-plane split waveguides. The measured average surface roughness is 2. 14  nm for the top/bottom of the waveguide, and 163. 13  nm for the waveguide sidewalls. The measured insertion loss per unit length is 0. 02 – 0. 07 dB/mm for 220 – 325 GHz, with a gold layer thickness of 1  μm on the top/bottom and 0. 3  μm on the sidewalls.
