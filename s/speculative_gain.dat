50|$|If {{the insured}} {{does not have}} an {{insurable}} interest in the object, the contract will be void and unenforceable, and regarded essentially as a gamble or wager. The purpose of the requirement of insurable interest is to distinguish insurance from wagering. The basic principle of insurance is to protect against loss; it is not concerned with the creation of opportunities for <b>speculative</b> <b>gain.</b> In the formative days of insurance law, things were quite different; insurance was in fact often indistinguishable from gambling. Excesses led in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries to the outright banning of life insurance, for example, in France, the Dutch Republic and Sweden. The more reasonable course, requiring an insurable interest as a prerequisite for the purchase of insurance, was pioneered in England, making insurance more than a mere game of chance, improving the repute of the insurance industry (formerly frowned upon as an aleatory contract), and gaining wider acceptance for it. As we have seen, South Africa formally imported the doctrine of insurable interest from England, but in 1977 the legislature repealed the colonial ordinances which had achieved this. The Appellate Division, in Mutual and Federal v Oudtshoorn Municipality, took their repeal to mean that the Roman-Dutch law of insurance is now the common law for insurance.|$|E

40|$|MCom (Risk Management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 South Africa {{has become}} more {{dependent}} on portfolio inflow to finance investment and consumption due to the low rate of government and household savings. Therefore, it is important from South Africa‟s perspective to maintain a stable portfolio inflow {{in order to ensure}} that the current account deficit does not reach unsustainable levels. However, portfolio inflow is anything but stable in South Africa. The risk associated with this is that when foreigners‟ expectations of South Africa shift, due to any form of instability or risk within the country or even internationally, it leads to massive withdrawals or outflow of funds, which in turn causes the currency to depreciate. The portfolio balance theory on the other hand states that an increase in portfolio inflow leads to the appreciation of the nominal exchange rate, and that this is perceived to work against economic growth. The main objective of this research is to determine the nature of the relationship between exchange rate volatility and portfolio flows, and the extent to which volatility in the exchange rate affect South Africa‟s portfolio inflow. The research uses Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models and quarterly data, ranging from 1995 to 2012 to investigate this relationship. From the VAR models a Granger causality test, as well impulse response functions is used to shed light on the influence of a one-unit shock in both foreign portfolio inflow and exchange rate volatility on the other variables in the model. Exchange rate volatility is measured using both Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) family models and the conventional standard deviation, in order to control for possible biasness caused by the choice of instrument of volatility. The results showed the nature of the relationship between exchange rate volatility and foreign portfolio inflow to South Africa‟s capital markets can be described as country-dependent and time-varying. South Africa‟s portfolio inflow exhibits high volatility and low persistence that are characteristics normally associated with “hot money”, which is largely driven by foreign investors‟ appetite for short-term <b>speculative</b> <b>gains.</b> The study identified the consistent presence of bidirectional causality between the exchange rate volatility and foreign portfolio inflow to South Africa, irrespective of the measurement of exchange rate volatility. The results also revealed that net portfolio flows are associated with exchange rate appreciation and that foreign portfolio inflow react much stronger to changes in exchange rate volatility than vice versa.

Could consolidation combat erratic tonnage demand, mounting regulatory pressure to provide quality service at reduced costs, rising costs of finance and unpredictable long-term returns that deter institutional capital? A questionnaire survey of capital providers' and charterers' attitudes towards consolidation found that long-term vessel employment concerned all potential capital providers, with perceptions of management experience and reputation critical to risk evaluation. Debt type providers were more supportive of consolidation practices, expecting more predictable repayment of principal and interest payments in larger companies, but equity type providers feared reduced opportunities to participate in <b>speculative</b> capital <b>gains</b> or asset play. Comparative interviews with two major crude carrier operators revealed contrasting strategies. One concentrated on pursuing short-term wealth maximisation through ensuring operational autonomy and asset flexibility and another on long-term wealth creation based on ballast minimisation and tactical capacity expansion.

40|$|Inequality within {{advanced}} {{countries has}} returned to levels typical of a century ago. At the global level it remains extremely high despite {{the rapid growth of}} major developing countries such as China, India and Brazil. This makes inequality a major economic issue, social problem and political challenge in today’s capitalism. However, economic inequality is the object of limited research efforts and attracts modest attention in the political arena. This is the result of several factors. Mainstream approaches view inequality as a necessary condition – or, at best, an unfortunate side effect - for achieving the more general objectives of economic growth and market efficiency. Most studies emphasise that inequality is to a large extent the consequence of international forces laying beyond the reach of policies by nation-states. More importantly, today’s inequality {{is the result of a}} variety of processes that have seriously increased its complexity, with major changes in its nature and mechanisms, compared to past decades. To the fundamental divide between capital and labour in the distribution of income between social classes and groups, new mechanisms have been added, that have fuelled income inequalities among individuals, rooted in the rise of top incomes, technological change, international production, labour markets, influence of families of origin and lack of intergenerational mobility. In this paper we propose an overall interpretation of the trajectory of inequality. The functional income distribution that leads to inequalities in factor incomes, with an increasing divide between the growing share of profits and financial rents – free to move across national borders, escape taxation and search for <b>speculative</b> <b>gains</b> – and the dwindling share of wages, nation-bound and unable to escape taxes. The specificity of top incomes – that combine rents, profits and “superstar” labour compensation complicates this picture with the effects of pro-rich policy changes. Inequalities have also strongly increased within wages, resulting from several factors. Education has an obvious influence, but plays a much smaller role than mainstream views would expect. Skill differences are increasingly important, and need to be examined in the context of specific professional groups, rather than with wide generalisations. Industry specificities, technology and international production do play a role, but in complex ways, depending on the nature of innovative strategies, local competences, market power and demand dynamics. Labour market arrangements – unionisation, presence of minimum wages or national contracts, diffusion of temporary or part-time labour contracts, etc. – are increasingly important factors in explaining the low pay of many young and low-skilled workers. Outside labour markets and the opportunities for social mobility promised by education, the family of origin remains a major determinant of individuals’ education and incomes, with an increasingly strong persistence of inequality across generations. The interpretation we provide offers a new explanation of the nature of today’s economic inequalities, of its consequences, and possible remedies. Inequality, Distribution, Welfare. ...|$|R
40|$|Arithmetic {{approximation}} is used {{to decrease}} the latency of an arithmetic circuit by shortening the critical path delay or the sampling period so that result is not guaranteed to be correct for every input combination. Thus, an acceptable compromise between the circuit latency and the average probability of correctness drives the circuit design. Two methods of arithmetic approximation are: temporally incompleteness where circuits quote the result before the critical path delay (overclocking); and logically incompleteness where circuits use simplified logic, so that most input cases are calculated correctly, but the slowest cases are calculated incorrectly. Arithmetic data value speculation (ADVS) is a speculation scheme based on arithmetic approximation, and {{is used to}} increase the throughput of a general purpose processor. ADVS is similar to branch prediction, an arithmetic instruction is issued to an exact arithmetic unit and an approximate arithmetic unit which provides an approximate result faster than the exact counterpart. The approximate result is forwarded to dependent operations so they may be speculatively issued. When the exact result is eventually known, it is compared to the approximate result, and the pipeline is flushed if they differ. This thesis, "ArithmeticDataValue Speculation", presents {{work in the field}} of digital arithmetic and computer architecture. A summary of current probabilistic arithmetic methods from the literature is provided, and novel designs of approximate integer arithmetic units are presented, including results from logical synthesis. A case study demonstrates approximate arithmetic units used to increase the average throughput of benchmark programs by speculatively issuing dependent operations in a RISC processor. The average correctness of the approximate arithmetic units are shown to be highly data dependent, results vary depending on the benchmarks being run. In addition, the average correctness when running benchmarks is consistently higher than for random inputs. Simulations show that many arithmetic operations are often repeated in the same benchmark, leading to a high variation in correctness. <b>Speculative</b> <b>gains</b> from one operation can be offset by speculation losses due repeated incorrect approximation of another approximate unit, so typical throughput gains through speculation in a general purpose processor pipeline are low. The minimum threshold correctness of an approximate arithmetic unit used for speculation is shown to be approximately 95 %. Logic synthesis is used to determine power, area and timing information for approximate units implemented from novel algorithms, and show a reduction in arithmetic cycle latency for integer operations, and the expense of 50 % leakage and area, and 90 % dynamic power. Value speculation can be complemented by result caching; repeated pipeline flushes can be avoided if the correct result is know before speculation, the average operation latency can be reduced, and caching can be used for operations that are difficult to approximate.

[...] Department of Economics and Social Sciences Consortium. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2015 The dissertation {{is comprised of}} three independent essays. Each essay examines the process of qualitative change in the provisioning process from a different vantage, while remaining fixed {{in relation to the}} Columbia River. Among the three essays the period 1866 to 1945 is covered. The first essay examines development of the region's railroad system, and the aspirations on the part of its financiers to realize <b>speculative</b> <b>gains.</b> The region is situated {{in the context of the}} post Civil War imperial stance of the state, and the rise of global finance. It is argued that while other colonial processes had operated in the region since the arrival of the fur trappers, construction of railroads embodied a watershed in the commitment for absentee owners to engage in transformational development. The second essay traces the emergence of the electric utility globally, and in reference to the Pacific Northwest. It is argued that the electric utility emerges directly from the railroad - finance nexus. Key social relationships are explored that explain the emergence of the electric utility as a going concern, with particular emphasis placed upon Henry Villard. Villard's financial connections were instrumental in establishing the markets in which Edison's patents would become successful in general. Villard's relationship with Edison, both social and pecuniary in nature, would shape the subsequent process of electrification for the region. The third essay argues that transformation of the Columbia River basin into a hydrological machine emerges as a response to the abuses of the electric utilities. Development of the basin for power, navigation, and irrigation were viewed as a means by which the inhabitants of the region might break the colonial yoke under which the utilities absentee owners had placed them. Private utilities had squandered the wealth embodied in the social technology, failing to provision inhabitants of the region with electricity uniformly at a fair rate. Utilities at the base of a holding company pyramid were used to extract surplus incomes from ratepayers, in part, by inflating their rate bases. Moreover, private utilities wielded political power and worked to undermine efforts to institute municipal or public power projects. Such tension was felt regionally and nationally, galvanzing a countervailing force capable of ushering in large-scale, public, hydroelectric projects.

Prices for imported goods have increased somewhat along with global inflation but prices of non-tradables have increased at a much faster rate (with Tehran's real estate prices increasing by about 1,500-2,000% sic over the last 10 years), resulting in a highly overvalued currency and damaging Iran's competitiveness.|$|R
40|$|This paper explores Speculative Precomputation, a {{technique}} that uses idle thread contexts in a multithreaded architecture to improve performance of single-threaded applications. It attacks program stalls from data cache misses by pre-computing future memory accesses in available thread contexts, and prefetching these data. This technique is evaluated by simulating {{the performance of a}} research processor based on the Itanium ÌÅ ISA supporting Simultaneous Multithreading. Two primary forms of Speculative Precomputation are evaluated. If only the non-speculative thread spawns <b>speculative</b> threads, performance <b>gains</b> of up to 30 % are achieved when assuming ideal hardware. However, this speedup drops considerably with more realistic hardware assumptions. Permitting speculative threads to directly spawn additional speculative threads reduces the overhead associated with spawning threads and enables significantly more aggressive speculation, overcoming this limitation. Even with realistic costs for spawning threads, speedups as high as 169 % are achieved, with an average speedup of 76 %. 1...|$|R

First, fantasy literature [...] "gained the attention of publishers and writers as the new goldmine" [...] and opened the new era for Korean fantasy market. <b>Speculative</b> fiction also <b>gained</b> more support in the literary world, and more writers of [...] "serious literature" [...] began using fantasy and science fiction elements in their works.Secondly, the amount of online serials getting published increased exponentially, in mostly [...] "genre literature" [...] (Korean: 장르문학, genre munak), which is a Korean umbrella term for genre of novels including romance, fantasy, wuxia, science fiction and mystery. Once published, it also took relatively less time for such online fiction, or Internet literature (Korean: 인터넷문학, Internet munak), to be adapted into other media, and also in more varied forms. In the case of Dragon Raja was adapted into games, radio drama, and textbook texts.|$|R
40|$|Improving Health Care: A Dose of Competition {{appeals to}} {{efficiency}} arguments in promoting {{a wide range}} of health care market reforms. But the market-based reforms discussed in Improving Health Care are not simply neutral with regard to equity in access to services; they are likely to have substantial and inequitable distributional effects. We use the case of consumer-driven health plans (CDHPs), the pillar of the Bush administration’s private-sector health reform efforts, to illustrate the limita-tions of viewing health policy reform through the lens of Improving Health Care. We conclude that the <b>speculative</b> efficiency <b>gains</b> from CDHPs need to be balanced against well-documented equity concerns within a normative framework. Moreover, other important ethical issues arise with regard to the risks imposed on the popula-tion by the introduction of policies that are based on a faith in markets rather than empirical evidence. Market-based reforms {{to improve the quality of}} care and reduce the steep trend in health benefit spending enjoy broad support from policy makers and health care purchasers in the United States (Herzlinger 2002; Porter and Teisberg 2004; Galvin et al. 2005; Gingrich 2003). The popularity of these reforms suggests a belief on the part of their proponents that price competition can work to improve efficiency in health care if buttressed by a set of still-emerging institutions including quality measurement and reporting. The view that competition in health care is inherently desir-Dr. Rosenthal gratefully acknowledges funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’...|$|R
40|$|Instruction set {{extensions}} (ISEs) can accelerate {{embedded processor}} performance. Many algorithms for ISE generation have shown good potential; {{some of them}} have recently been expanded to include Architecturally Visible Storage (AVS) —compiler-controlled memories, similar to scratchpads, that are accessible only to ISEs. To achieve a speedup using AVS, Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfers are required to move data from the main memory to the AVS; unfortunately, this creates coherence problems between the AVS and the cache, which previous methods for ISEs with AVS failed to address; additionally, these methods need to leave many conservative DMA transfers in place, whose execution significantly limits the achievable speedup. This paper presents a memory coherence scheme for ISEs with AVS, which can ensure execution correctness and memory consistency with minimal area overhead. We also present a method that speculatively removes redundant DMA transfers. Cycle-accurate experimental results were obtained using an FPGA-emulation platform. These results show that the application-specific instruction-set extended processors with <b>speculative</b> DMA-enhanced AVS <b>gain</b> significantly over previous techniques, despite the overhead of the coherence mechanism...|$|R
