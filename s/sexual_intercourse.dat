5|$|There are {{a number}} of common misconceptions {{regarding}} sex and pregnancy. Douching after <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> is not an effective form of birth control.

5|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{infection}} is Escherichia coli, though other bacteria or fungi may rarely be the cause. Risk factors include female anatomy, <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse,</b> diabetes, obesity, and family history. Although <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> is a risk factor, UTIs are not classified as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Kidney infection, if it occurs, usually follows a bladder infection but may also result from a blood-borne infection. Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. In those with vague symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection.

40|$|Introduction: Hypothalamic {{amenorrhea}} (HA) is {{a condition}} treatable with pulsatile gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In case of ovulation failures under GnRH, hMG stimulation can be proposed as an alternative treatment in association with IVF. The {{purpose of this study}} was to perform a follow-up of all HA patients treated with GnRH and hMG in our Fertility Unit. Material and Methods: Thirty two patients, 24 to 32 years old, were treated for a total of 103 cycles with GnRH (20 µg/ 90 min during the follicular phase and 20 µg/ 120 min after ovulation) between January 1989 and December 1996. Follicular growth was monitored using transvaginal ultrasound and blood estradiol (E 2), progesterone (P), luteinizing hormone (LH) assays. Ovulation was confirmed by the presence of a follicular diameter ≥ 20 mm with E 2 > 0. 8 nmol/l and a spontaneous LH peak. Patients were proposed to have timed <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourses</b> during the following days or were inseminated with washed sperm (IUI). After several treatment failures, an alternative stimulation protocol using hMG was proposed to 7 patients (6 IVF, 1 IUI). Results: GnRH allowed ovulation to occur in 79 cycles (76. 7 %/cycle) leading to 62 timed <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourses</b> cycles and 17 IUI cycles. No ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was observed. Twenty three pregnancies (29. 1 %/cycle) terminated in 9 spontaneous abortions (39. 1 %/pregnancy) and 14 deliveries (49 %/patient). Four additional deliveries in three patients (5 babies) occurred after hMG stimulation. Five patients became spontaneously pregnant after pump stimulation arrest (N= 2) or unsuccessfull IVF (N= 3). Combining GnRH and hMG cycles, 18 deliveries were obtained in 15 patients. The direct and indirect effectiveness of these treatments was thus 62. 5 % (20 deliveries/ 32 patients). Conclusions: GnRH is an efficient and safe treatment of anovulation in women with HA. After GnRH or hMG ovarian stimulation cycles, spontaneous ovulation may be restored in certain HA patients with high chances of conceptio...|$|R
