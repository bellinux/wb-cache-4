50|$|Guppy, {{as well as}} her <b>scientific</b> <b>partner,</b> Leonard Hawkes, {{composed}} a case study on the composite dykes of eastern Iceland in the year of 1924. Although Hawkes conducted the field work himself, Guppy {{played a crucial role in}} assisting and cooperating with deciphering the commonly occurring composite dykes in the tertiary plateau-basalt series of the respective area studied. The overruling findings are as follows: the exposed dyke is seen to be composed of basic and acidic rocks, as well as seven members- the dolerites alternating in the quartz-porphyries. The studied dyke is exposed in cliff-section, which is 2400 feet in vertical height at Hokulvikurgil, Breithdal. Guppy and Hawkes were also able to correctively decipher the sequence of intrusions in the composite dyke. As well, analysis of the origin of quartz and felspar-xenocrysts in the dolerites were made, and in addition, the origins of the basic inclusions in the acidic rocks.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{asks whether}} there is {{evidence}} of higher innovation output from firms where there are more foreign activity in terms of foreign direct investments (FDI), trade, collaboration on innovation, or if geographic proximity between innovators is more important. The conclusions are that 1) there is robust evidence that FDI, observed as foreign-owned firms is neutral with respect to innovation output; 2) import correlates highly significantly with innovation product sales among multinational firms (MNEs) as well as non-MNEs; 3) the evidence for spillover from R&D collaboration with domestic innovation partners is weak when bilateral arrangements are considered. Only non-MNEs collaborating with local, regional or national suppliers and customers are benefiting from the collaboration; 4) when multilateral R&D arrangements are taken into account it is shown that R&D-collaborators have higher innovation inputs than non-collaborators. In particular, when the network includes a foreign subunit and a <b>scientific</b> <b>partner,</b> the likelihood of successful technology transfer increases considerably. QC 2012020...|$|R
40|$|Service {{productivity}} {{has become}} a broadly discussed research topic in the last years. The German strategic partnership "Productivity of services" aims on improvements of the scientific discussion in this economically highly important topic. Within the strategic partnership the joint project "ServUp" is focusing on solutions for a dynamic, phase-specific productivity management {{in the realm of}} service lifecycles. This paper deals with approaches and results of a "ServUp"-sub-project, which aims to increase productivity within the process chain of mechanized wood harvesting in the forestry industry. The German subsidiary of the Swedish producer of mobile forestry machines is developing innovative approaches in order to increase their internal productivity as well as the external productivity of their customers in close relation with a <b>scientific</b> <b>partner.</b> Internally and externally focused approaches are both based on the implementation of a web-based system, which collects, saves and processes machine data from harvesters and forwarders in the forest. By doing so, new services, such as proactive maintenance, performance benchmarking of machines and drivers etc. can be offered. The paper illustrates methods and results of the project...|$|R
