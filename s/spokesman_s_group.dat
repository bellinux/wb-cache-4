40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the capacity of}} shunts to relieve portal hypertension and decrease the safe minimal liver remnant in pigs. METHODS: A subtotal hepatectomy with < 60 mL blood loss and without hepatic pedicle occlusion was performed. The mesenteric venous inflow was diverted through a mesocaval shunt (MCS) constructed using the prepared left renal vein with an end-to-side running suture of 5 - 0 proline. All 21 animals that underwent subtotal hepatectomy and/or MCS were divided into three groups. In the 15 % group, the residual volume was 14 %- 19 % of total liver volume (TLV); in the 15 %+ <b>S</b> <b>group,</b> the residual volume was also 14 %- 19 % of TLV with a mesocaval shunt (MCS); and in the 10 %+ <b>S</b> <b>group,</b> the residual volume was 8 %- 13 % of TLV with an MCS. In the three groups, the intraoperative portal vein pressure (PVP) and portal vein flow (PVF) were monitored and compared at laparotomy and 1 h post-hepatectomy. The survival rate, sinusoidal endothelial damage, tissue analysis, and serum analysis were investigated among the three groups. RESULTS: The percentage residual liver volume was 15. 9 %, 16. 1 % and 11. 8 % in the 15 %, 15 %+ S, 10 %+ <b>S</b> <b>groups,</b> respectively. After hepatectomy, PVF and portal-to-arterial flow ratio in the 15 %+ <b>S</b> <b>group</b> significantly decreased and hepatic artery flow (HAF) per unit volume significantly increased, compared {{to those in the}} 15 % group. The PVP in the 15 %+ <b>S</b> <b>group</b> and 10 %+ <b>S</b> <b>group</b> increased slightly from that measured at laparotomy; however, in the 15 % group, the PVP increased immediately and significantly above that observed in the other two groups. The 14 -d survival rates were 28. 5 %, 85. 6 %, and 14. 2 % in the 15 %, 15 %+ S, and 10 %+ <b>S</b> <b>groups,</b> respectively. In the 15 %+ <b>S</b> <b>group,</b> the shunts effectively attenuated injury to the sinusoidal endothelium, and the changes in the serum and tissue analysis results were significantly reduced compared to those in the 15 % and 10 %+ <b>S</b> <b>groups.</b> CONCLUSION: MCS can decompress the portal vein and so attenuate liver injury from hyperperfusion, and make extreme or marginal hepatectomy safer...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze whether a {{politically}} connected firm that operates {{in a country with}} an established legal system and a low perceived level of corruption can benefit from its connections in the form of preferential access to land. More specifically, the thesis examines whether the political connections of Finland’s largest retail trade operator <b>S</b> <b>Group</b> have been related to Finnish municipalities’ zoning decisions concerning the group’s ABC service station stores during the period between 1996 and 2009. I also analyze whether the hypothesized favorable treatment of <b>S</b> <b>Group</b> in zoning decisions is related to the market share of its ABC service station stores. In this thesis, a political connection is defined as a dual role of a member of an <b>S</b> <b>Group</b> governance organ as a municipal politician. As <b>S</b> <b>Group</b> consists of 21 regional cooperatives that are independent companies with their own management, {{it can be argued that}} the group has a relatively strong local presence. Due to this geographically decentralized decision making structure, the group can be expected to be particularly well connected to municipal politics. DATA The main dataset used in this thesis consists of <b>S</b> <b>Group’s</b> political connections from the period between 1996 and 2009. The main sample includes 64 ABC service station stores that have been pure new investments, i. e. green-field projects, and that have been built between 1998 and 2010. The political connections dataset is built by cross-referencing the names of persons who have simultaneously been members of <b>S</b> <b>Group’s</b> governance organs and Finnish municipal politicians from 1996 to 2010. The political connections data used in this study is unique, as it is manually combined from the annual reports of <b>S</b> <b>Group’s</b> regional cooperatives, the Statistics Finland’s election database, and by directly requesting data from Finnish municipalities. Additionally, data on traffic amounts from the Finnish Transport Agency’s database and detailed establishment level data of small grocery stores and service stations from the Business Register of Statistics Finland are collected to assess the quality of the operating locations of service stations and their competitive situation. RESULTS The results show that the political connections of <b>S</b> <b>Group</b> are widespread during the entire examination period. However, the findings do not support the conclusion that the political connections of the group would have systemically affected the municipalities’ zoning decisions concerning ABC service station stores. The analysis shows that ABC service station stores are located in better operating areas than their competitors, but <b>S</b> <b>Group’s</b> political connections are not found to be associated with this dominance. Similarly, the findings do not support the conclusion that the political connections of <b>S</b> <b>Group</b> would have affected the market shares of its service station stores...|$|R

Materials and methodsThe materials examined were a flowable composite (Filtek™ Z 350 XT Flowable) and a pit and fissure sealant (Clinpro™ Sealant). Thirty disks of each material were prepared. The 30 made of the flowable composite were divided into three groups (n= 10 each) according to the three different curing times studied: 20 <b>s</b> (<b>group</b> 1), 40 <b>s</b> (<b>group</b> 2), and 60 <b>s</b> (<b>group</b> 3). Similarly, the 30 disks made of the pit and fissure sealant were divided into three groups (n= 10 each) according to the three different curing times: 20 <b>s</b> (<b>group</b> 4), 40 <b>s</b> (<b>group</b> 5), and 60 <b>s</b> (<b>group</b> 6). After polymerization, the disks were removed from the mold and stored in dry, lightproof containers in an incubator at 37 °C for 24 h. The DC was obtained using an Avatar 320 FTIR spectrometer. Then the data were analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis test and the Fisher’s least significant difference post hoc test for multiple comparisons (alpha= 0. 05). ResultsDC values for the flowable composite (Filtek™ Z 350 XT) were higher (p= 0. 002) than those for the pit and fissure sealant (Clinpro™ Sealant). Group 2 and group 5 showed significantly higher DC values than group 1 and group 4, respectively. There was no difference between groups 2 and 3 or between groups 5 and 6 (p= 2. 93).

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, came a new era in Canadian {{constitutional}} politics. The Charter empowered various organized interests in Canadian society by granting fundamental rights to a number of groups. Given that historically, women have experienced discrimination by the courts, political institutions and decision makers, the combination of sections 15 and 28 of the Charter were considered by many as a victory for women 2 ̆ 7 s equality. For women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> in English Canada the Meech Lake Accord in 1987 represented a serious threat to these equality provisions. Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> became divided over the 2 ̆ 2 distinct society 2 ̆ 2 provision of the Meech Lake Accord. Perhaps the greatest rift which developed in the women 2 ̆ 7 s movement was that between women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> in English Canada and in Quebec. As the constitutional amending process continued with the Charlottetown Accord, it became increasingly evident that the interests of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> were diverse, and that women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> desired a formal role in the amending of the constitution. By examining the actions of various women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> it is possible to understand why there is no monolithic women 2 ̆ 7 s movement in Canada [...] nor should there be. Indeed women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> and the women they represent are diverse and divided along many lines including race and region. The problem for Canadian women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> today is that they seek to represent a sector of the population rather than a special area. In doing so, their structures compete directly with the Parliamentary system which is based on geographic representation. While Canadian women have had their concerns advanced through interest groups, in order for women to continue to influence the state, the movement must focus on commonalities and shared experience. Chapter one provides a historical background of women 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to the constitution, and argues that this experience has been one of discriminatory treatment. Chapter two looks at current constitutional theory and introduces the literature by feminist scholars who identify women 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to the state as being different to that of men. Chapter three compares the lobby by women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> in 1987 and 1992, and makes the case that women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> were marginally more successful in influencing the government in 1992 primarily due to public support and that of the Native Women 2 ̆ 7 s Association. Chapter four concludes the paper by acknowledging that there does not exist a monolithic women 2 ̆ 7 s movement in Canada. It is important however for women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> to reach consensus on some issues in order to reshape and redefine the present movement in Canada which is currently still recovering from the divisive rounds in 1987 and 1992.

40|$|Purpose: Videofluoroscopy is {{generally}} considered a "gold standard" technique; however t technique exposes subjects to radiation. Ultrasonography is applied widely in clinical practice because of low cost, safety of the technique, and absence of radiation exposure. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate hyoid bone movement trajectories during swallowing in healthy subjects using ultrasonography. Subject and Methods: Data were obtained from 15 healthy volunteers (mean age: 34. 9 ± 9. 3). The subjects were divided into 3 groups: 5 subjects in their 20 s, 5 subjects in their 30 s and 5 subjects in their 40 s. The subjects were examined while sitting in an upright position, with the back against a wall to control movement. The transducer was placed in a longitudinal scan above the larynx. The hyoid bone was identified on the scan as a high echoic area with posterior acoustic shadow. Then, the subjects swallowed 5 mL of mineral water, with a measurement frequency of 5 times. The digital-ultrasonographic recordings were viewed at 30 frames/s for 3 seconds. Results: The movement was divided into 4 phases: A, slowly ascending phase; B, rapidly ascending phase; C, temporary pause phase (position of maximum rise); D, rapid and slow descending shifts toward the resting position phase. We easily visualized the hyoid bone trajectory using ultrasonography. In all cases, ultrasonographic analysis of the hyoid bone was confirmed to have a similar trajectory as determined with videofluoroscopy. Ultrasonography can accurately determine swallowing duration and trajectory of hyoid bone movement. There was a significant difference in swallowing duration between the 20 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> and 30 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> and between the 20 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> and 40 <b>s</b> <b>groups</b> (P < 0. 05). However, the difference between the 30 <b>s</b> <b>group</b> and 40 <b>s</b> <b>group</b> was not significant (P= 0. 87). Conclusion: The results show that the dynamic phase image of the hyoid bone movement can be revealed by ultrasonographic visualization. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
