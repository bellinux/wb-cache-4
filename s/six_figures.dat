The men hold their heads aloft to make better use of their other senses. The diagonal composition reinforces the off-kilter motion of the <b>six</b> <b>figures</b> falling in progression. It is considered a masterwork for its accurate detail and composition. Copies include a larger version by Bruegel's son Pieter Brueghel the Younger, and the work has inspired literature such as poetry by Charles Baudelaire and William Carlos Williams, and a novel by Gert Hofmann.|$|E

25|$|Duesenberg became {{far less}} popular during World War II, {{by the end}} of which a few Model Js were advertised for around $300 to $400, with some {{ultimately}} selling for only $100 or $200. Business rebounded in the 1950s, when classic and vintage cars became popular among collectors. Several Model Js were advertised in the New York Times in the fall of 1950, at prices as low as $500. By 1959 a decent example could not be bought for less than $4,000, and an exceptional example could approach $10,000. By 1969, model J's were selling anywhere between $15,000 and $50,000. The first Duesenberg to break <b>six</b> <b>figures</b> was a model J that sold for $205,000 in April 1974. The first Duesenberg to sell in excess of $1 Million was in 1985. Today, model J's go for anywhere from mid <b>six</b> <b>figures</b> to well into seven figures. One particular example sold for $10 million recently.|$|E

25|$|Registration 1 {{sold for}} £7.25million {{and is the}} highest price paid for a plate – in the United Arab Emirates. It was {{purchased}} by Abu Dhabi businessman Saeed Abdul Ghaffar Khouri in 2008. As of 2014, the registration 25O broke a new record of being the highest priced plate sold at a DVLA auction. Registration 25O was purchased for £518,000 by Ferrari dealer John Collins in 2014; the plate now sits pride of place on a Ferrari 250 SWB once owned by rock star Eric Clapton. Registration F1 and RAC3R have been considered as the most desirable plates amongst supercar and Formula One fanatics. The registration RAC3R is a suffix style plate that was issued {{in the same year}} British racing driver James Hunt won the Formula One World Championship in 1976. The plate covers an endless list of all the different forms of racing, making it extremely desirable. Since there has been a big fuss over race related plates the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency has made a racer game for motorists to celebrate the huge profits made from the sales of private plates. The celebration took place at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2010. Unlike horse racing, Formula One racing has become more popular in the last few years, hence why the F1 plate was always going to sell well. On 25 January 2008 the registration F1 sold for £440,000 to Bradford Car design entrepreneur Afzal Kahn. The plate was previously owned and sold by Essex County Council and was sold to raise money for training young drivers. Today the F1 plate has a valuation less than the winning bid with the price tag stagnating on that particular plate. Originally the plate was affixed in 1904 to the Panhard et Levassor of the then County Surveyor. Previously, a few months before the F1 plate was purchased, the S1 plate sold for £397,500 at an auction in September 2007 by an anonymous buyer making it the second most expensive number plate ever sold in the UK. The S1 plate was originally owned by Sir John H A MacDonald, the Lord Kingsburgh and was Edinburgh's first ever number plate. Within the space of two years the S1 plate sold for £65,500 more than the M1 plate that sold at auction in Goodwood on 7 July 2006. Registrations 1D VIP1 51NGH K1NGS and 1O are also marked as considerably expensive plates that have sold publicly in excess of <b>six</b> <b>figures.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lynch's {{experiments}} with moving sculptures {{led to his}} piquing interest in the medium of motion picture film. In 1966, {{with the help of}} Fisk, Lynch animated a one-minute short feature called <b>Six</b> <b>Figures</b> Getting Sick; the project cost $200 and was filmed with a sixteen millimeter camera. The sculpture-motion picture was a simple animated loop of several figures growing increasingly nauseous before vomiting down the [...] screen. This loop was repeated several times and accompanied by the sound of an air-raid [...] siren; however, it was projected onto a cast of Lynch's head in order to distort the footage further.|$|E
500|$|After <b>Six</b> <b>Figures</b> Getting Sick was completed, one of Lynch's classmates, H. Barton Wasserman, {{offered to}} pay $1000 for a similar motion picture {{to be made for}} an art {{installation}} in his home. Lynch purchased a clockwork Bolex movie camera, and began to teach himself cinematography. Lynch worked on the commissioned motion picture over the next two months, crafting a mix of live action and animation in a split-screen format. However, when the film was developed, [...] an error along the way had rendered it indistinguishable and unusable. Wasserman allowed Lynch to keep the remainder of the budget, which he used to fund the production of a new motion picture project, The Alphabet.|$|E

500|$|The Fifth Elegy {{is largely}} {{inspired}} by Pablo Picasso's 1905 Rose Period painting, Les Saltimbanques ("The Acrobats", {{also known as}} [...] "The Family of Saltimbanques") in which Picasso depicts <b>six</b> <b>figures</b> pictured [...] "in {{the middle of a}} desert landscape and it is impossible to say whether they are arriving or departing, beginning or ending their performance." [...] Rilke depicted the six artists about to begin their performance, and that they were used as a symbol of [...] "human activity... always travelling and with no fixed abode, they are even a shade more fleeting than the rest of us, whose fleetingness was lamented." [...] Further, Rilke in the poem described these figures as standing on a [...] "threadbare carpet" [...] to suggest [...] "the ultimate loneliness and isolation of Man in this incomprehensible world, practicing their profession from childhood to death as playthings of an unknown will... before their 'pure too-little' had passed into 'empty too-much.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{stained glass}} is mostly late-19th-century Arts and Crafts by James Powell and Sons. Powell, coincidentally based at Whitefriars, a former Carmelite friary in London, used leading {{members of the}} {{movement}} such as Edward Burne-Jones as designers, and his nine windows at Blakeney are regarded as fine examples of his work. The east window dating from 1895 represents the Te Deum, and the south windows, glazed in 1900, {{tell the story of}} the early British church. Some 15th-century fragments of the original Norwich School glass that had been buried in the churchyard during the Reformation were incorporated into one of the otherwise plain windows in the north aisle in 1938, showing [...] "Christ rising from the tomb", with <b>six</b> <b>figures</b> above. Five of the figures are angels; there would have been nine originally, one for each order. The sixth image depicts a female saint wearing a crown. The angel's legs are clothed in [...] "feather tights", believed to have been derived from costumes worn in medieval religious plays. The north porch is flanked by two blue-themed modern stained glass windows by Jane Gray from 2002, one dedicated to the RAF, the other to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). The stained glass, taken as a whole, has been described as showing a [...] "phenomenal standard of composition and artistry... Few churches contain such a treasury." [...] The current reredos and altar were erected in 1923, as was a wooden war memorial in the north aisle.|$|E

2500|$|Below the frieze is a {{cylindrical}} mount {{on which}} are 32 life-size figures. In the front (or south-facing side) of the mount is the panoplied figure of Minerva.

[...] Behind Minerva's head, allegorical [...] "Spirits of War" [...] trumpet in every direction, calling the citizens of the South to aid their country. One spirit resembles a gorgon, while another holds a cinerary urn. On either side of the fallen woman are figures depicting those who came to the South's aid. They represent each branch of the Confederate armed forces: Miner, sailor, sapper, and soldier. There are four figures (two in high relief, two in low relief) facing Minerva on the southwest corner of the mount.
