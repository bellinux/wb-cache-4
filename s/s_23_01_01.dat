Based on this statistical analysis, repeatability and reproducibility levels may be specified for analysis of these 4 phases in unknown mixtures prepared from the same materials. Replicate analyses in the same laboratory should differ by no more than 1. 1 % (relative to the total clinker) [the previous level was also 1. 1 %]. Replicate analyses in different laboratories should differ by no more than 1. 7 % (relative to the total clinker) [the previous level was 1. 8 %]. Overall, analyses should differ from the known value by no more than 1. 7 % (relative to the total clinker).

Although, HLA-G expression in allotransplanted patients is correlated with a better allograft acceptance, it is associated with an advanced grade of the tumor in cancer. In addition to the role on the immune system, HLA-G is also involved in successful pregnancy through the embryo implantation, fetal survival and the initial steps of hematopoiesis and angiogenesis. The {{aim of this study}} was determination of HLA-G allele frequencies in a healthy population of Iran. In this research, we selected 100 samples from healthy Iranian individuals and henceforth, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequencing technique for exon 2, 3, 4 and intron 2 of the gene for evaluating the HLA-G alleles frequencies. Investigation of intronic (intron 2) variation is the novelty of our study.

T cell infiltrates in affected brain tissue, {{and the presence of}} circulating autoantibodies in some RE patients has indicated that RE may be an autoimmune disease. The strongest genetic links to autoimmunity reside in the MHC locus, therefore we determined the HLA class I and class II alleles carried by a cohort of 24 RE surgery cases by targeted in-depth genomic sequencing. Compared with a reference population the allelic frequency of three alleles, DQA 1 * 04 : <b>01</b> : <b>01,</b> DQB 1 * 04 : 02 : <b>01</b> and HLA-C* 07 : 02 : <b>01</b> : <b>01</b> indicated that they might confer susceptibility to the disease.

Further, eight patients in the study cohort carried HLA-A* 03 : <b>01</b> : <b>01</b> : <b>01,</b> which has been linked to susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Four patients carried a combination of three HLA class II alleles that has been linked to type 1 diabetes (DQA 1 * 05 : <b>01</b> : <b>01</b> : <b>01</b> ~DQB 1 * 02 : <b>01</b> : <b>01</b> ~DRB 1 * 03 : <b>01</b> : <b>01</b> : <b>01),</b> and five patients carried a combination of HLA class II alleles that has been linked to the risk of contracting multiple sclerosis (DQA 1 * <b>01</b> : 02 : <b>01</b> : <b>01</b> ~DQB 1 * 06 : 02 : <b>01</b> ~DRB 1 * 15 : <b>01</b> : <b>01</b> : <b>01).</b> We also analyzed the diversity of T cells in brain and blood specimens from 14 of these RE surgery cases by sequencing the third complementarity regions (CDR 3 s) of rearranged T cell receptor  genes.
