2500|$|A CD {{software}} release can contain up to 700megabytes of data, which presented challenges when sending over the Internet, {{particularly in the}} late 1990s when broadband was unavailable to most home consumers. These challenges apply to an even greater extent for a <b>single-layer</b> <b>DVD</b> release, which can contain up to 4.7GB of data. The warez scene made it standard practice to split releases up into many separate pieces, called disks, using several file compression formats: (historical TAR, LZH, ACE, UHA, ARJ), ZIP, and most commonly RAR. The original purpose of these [...] "disks" [...] was so that each [...]rar file could fit on a single 1.44MB 3½ inch floppy disk. With the growing size of games, {{this is no longer}} feasible, as hundreds of disks would need to be used. The average size of disks released by groups today are 50megabytes or 100megabytes, however it is common to find disks up to 200megabytes.|$|E
50|$|The {{capacity}} of a VCDHD is 4.7 GB, the same as an average <b>single-layer</b> <b>DVD.</b> According to the official site, the tests at Philips laboratories have proven the discs to be fully compatible with modern DVD players. With use of blue laser technology steadily becoming available now, the capacity may be increased by up to 15 GB.|$|E
5000|$|MultiLevel Recording (ML) (also {{known as}} M-ary) was a {{technology}} originally developed by Optex Corporation and promoted by Calimetrics {{to increase the}} storage capacity of optical discs. It failed to establish itself on the market. Through a combination of proprietary media, recorder, reader and player modifications, Calimetrics proposed that ML could increase the capacity of a CD-ROM, CD-R or CD-RW to 2 GB, a <b>single-layer</b> <b>DVD,</b> DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW or DVD-RAM to 7.1 to 10 GB and a single-layer Blu-ray Disc (BD) {{to as much as}} 60 GB. An optionally integrated Digital Rights Management (DRM) system entitled MovieGuard was also suggested. An industry group called the ML Alliance was formed in 2000 to help commercialize ML technology. Members eventually included Calimetrics, TDK, Sanyo Semiconductor, Plextor, Matsushita Kotobuki Electronics, Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Verbatim, Teac and Yamaha.|$|E
5000|$|The stacked, shine-through {{arrangement}} of layers does {{come with a}} small increase in error rate due to reduced reflectivity of the written layers, and a similar small risk of crosstalk interference. One of the techniques employed to help compensate for these reliability shortcomings is a 10% increase in minimum mark (digital 0 or 1) length on the disc, with a corresponding 10% increase in rotation speed and 10% reduction in gross recordable capacity, accounting for the lower capacity of a single-sided dual-layer DVD at 8.5 billion bytes, versus a double-sized, <b>single-layer</b> <b>DVD</b> at 9.4 billion (for 12 cm discs). Detail differences in formatting and file structure mean the [...] "usable" [...] data area capacity does not change by exactly this much, but for all intents a DVD-R DL has effectively 20/11ths the capacity of a DVD-R SL, and the same holds for +R, commercially pressed, and 8 cm discs.|$|E

5000|$|Although technologically {{superior}} to VHS, {{there were several}} main drawbacks with recordable DVDs that slowed their adoption. When standalone DVD recorders first appeared on the Japanese consumer market in 1999, these early units were very expensive, costing between $2500 and $4000 (USD). (As of early 2007, DVD recorders from notable brands are selling for US$200 or €150 and less, with even lower [...] "street prices".) Different DVD recordable formats also caused confusion, as early units supported only DVD-RAM and DVD-R discs, but the more recent units can record to all major formats DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-R DL and DVD+R DL. Some of these DVD formats are not rewritable, whereas videocassettes could be recorded over repeatedly (notwithstanding physical wear). Another important drawback of DVD recording is that one <b>single-layer</b> <b>DVD</b> is limited to around 120 minutes of recording if the quality {{is not to be}} significantly reduced, while VHS tapes are readily available up to 210 minutes (standard play) in NTSC areas and even 300 minutes in PAL areas. Dual layer DVDs, which increase the high quality recording mode to almost four hours, are increasingly available, but the cost of this medium was still relatively high compared to standard single-layer discs. Another factor was the increasing use of digital video file formats and online video sharing, skipping physical media entirely. For these reasons, DVD recorders never took hold of the video recording market like VCRs had.|$|E
