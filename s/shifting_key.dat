The QCSK modulation technique provides double benefit, namely: higher data rate with similar BER performance and same bandwidth occupation as DCSK. By combining the advantage of code shifted differential chaos <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (CS-DCSK) and Quadrature chaos <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (QCSK) scheme, a novel CS-QCSK modulation scheme called code shifted Quadrature chaos <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> is proposed. The noise performance of CS-QCSK is better to most conventional modulation schemes and also provides an increased data transmission rates with greatly improved robustness.

40|$|Getting science policy {{right is}} a core {{objective}} {{of government that}} bears on scientific advance, economic growth, health, and longevity. Yet the process of science is changing. As science advances and knowledge accumulates, ensuing generations of innovators spend longer in training and become more narrowly expert, <b>shifting</b> <b>key</b> innovations (i) later in the life cycle and (ii) from solo researchers toward teams. This paper summarizes the evidence that science has evolved - and continues to evolve - on both dimensions. The paper then considers science policy. The ongoing shift away from younger scholars and toward teamwork raises serious policy challenges. Central issues involve (a) maintaining incentives for entry into scientific careers as the training phase extends, (b) ensuring effective evaluation of ideas (including decisions on patent rights and research grants) as evaluator expertise narrows, and (c) providing appropriate effort incentives as scientists increasingly work in teams. Institutions such as government grant agencies, the patent office, the science education system, and the Nobel Prize come under a unified focus in this paper. In all cases, {{the question is how}} these institutions can change.

40|$|Policymakers are {{concerned}} about nitrogen and phosphorus export to water bodies. Exports may be reduced by paying farmers to adopt practices to reduce runoff or by paying performance incentives tied to estimated run-off reductions. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of practice and performance incentives for reducing nitrogen exports. Performance incentives potentially improve farm-level and allocative efϐiciencies relative to practice incentives. However, the efϐiciency improvements can be undermined by baseline shifts when growers adopt crops that enhance the performance payments but cause more pollution. Policymakers must carefully specify rules for performance-incentive programs and payments to avoid such baseline <b>shifting.</b> <b>Key</b> Words: baseline, Chesapeake Bay, cover crops, export, mathematical programming, nitrogen, performance incentive, practice incentive Since passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, policymakers have devised state and federal policies and programs in efforts to achieve the act’s water-quality goals. Current efforts include establishment of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for waterbodies that are deemed impaired due {{to one or more}} pollutants. TMDLs establish maximum allowances of pollutant exports or processes to achieve state water-quality standards (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 1999, National Research Council 2001). Recently, attention has focused on motivating conservation behaviors and assessing progress toward attaining water-quality goals through payments for performance measures as an alternative to practice adoption (Winsten and Hunter 2011, Winsten 2009). With performance-incentive programs, payments to farmers or other stakeholders could be based on estimated reductions in pollutant exports rather than adoption of the practices.

40|$|Computers {{have been}} around for about half a century and their social effects have been {{described}} under many headings. Society is changing under the in uence of advanced informa- tion technology; we face fundamental transformations in social organisation and structure. Such a change is getting much more evident in the recent period of time, nowadays digital technology pervades mayor part of the world, mobile position aware devices, social media and apps are spread everywhere. E-Government and e-Health force citizens to interact via the Internet, access and digital skills make the difference. Economy has been profoundly changed, on the one side huge market players such as B&B or UBER practically do not own any of the assets they manage but they own the “platform” to provide such services and this widely demonstrated to be the main asset. Another actual trend is about key information, user pro les, and big data analytics trading; Amazon and digital malls use to have a core business different from the appearing one as it was for Mc Donald’s as a real estate corporation. They do not earn from the of cial business, but selling selected customer’s pro les to other business companies. The combined effect of such trends is deeply in uencing society <b>shifting</b> <b>key</b> assets from the physical world to the cyber dimen sion; young citizens are changing and the change is not smooth, it is a real discontinuity. Today we are not yet in the maturity phase of what time ago was named “digital revolution”, but we are already aware that it is a true revolution, not simply a rich set of new technologies. It is profoundly impacting on society and economy, changing both of them in an almost unpredictable way. It is not the matter to increase the throughput of industries or reduce costs. Digital domain revolutionises because it is ontologically different from past; copies are perfectly equal to originals, can travel across the planet at light speed and be in nitely replicated at zero cost. There are no more distances and time constraints. Even physical objects may enjoy “tele-transportation” thanks to “makers” and 3 D plotting. It is the time of the “wisdom of crowds”, to mention a well-known book. We are witnessing relevant changes due both to technological enhancements and modi cation of user requirements/expecta- tions. ICTs are stimulating changes in the way most people earn their incomes; altering the balance between our roles as consumers and producers; changing the way we educate succeeding genera- tion and train ourselves; changing the fruition of world’s cultural heritage; transforming the delivery of health care; altering the way we govern ourselves; changing the way we form and manage communities; altering the way we obtain and communicate infor- mation; contributing to bridge some cultural or physical gaps; and modifying pattern of activity among the elderly, last but not least potentially contributing to a green world. Mobile position aware devices together with powerful virtual and augmented reality applications are considered everyday commodities to nd a shop or choose an apartment in our preferred district. Such commodities are deeply in uencing our behaviour reshaping the way we do things or acquire experiences. Big and open data extended the area of data querying and data mining enabling new services and applications. Internet of things and network of sensors are progressively enabling new sectors and services, deep machine learning and crowd computing are progressively doing the rest. Crowdfunding, crypto-currency, FinTech, bitcoins and blockchains are going to revolutionise economy. In recent times arti cial intelligence is back 1 and offers new applicative scenarios that may really bene t citizens in their everyday life. In particular, the crowd approach summed with big and open data opened the way to innovative approaches simply unthinkable before. Even if announced by the Chinese government as a reality in the eld of telecommunication satellites, we will not take into account today the incredible future impact on society due to quantum computers and huge sets of Qubits ensuring “superposition”, “entanglement”, and “quantum tunnelling”. This is not a complete list of changes, but highlights some of the most prominent and important effects of ICT on our society. Everyone experienced in “ICT based innovation” knows that “it is not only a matter of technology”. Of course technology advances are one of the potential actors, enablers, {{as in the case of}} the diffusion of personal computing or easy access to digital networking.
