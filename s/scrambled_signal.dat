50|$|Ultimately, Spectrum was unsuccessful. The channel {{encountered}} {{technical issues}} with their broadcast signal because WFBN's transmitter atop the John Hancock Center in the Chicago Loop {{was prone to}} multipath interference (ghosting) due to {{the large number of}} high rise buildings in the area. Multipath made viewing normal TV broadcasts unpleasant, and often made it impossible for the Spectrum set top boxes to convert the <b>scrambled</b> <b>signal</b> into a usable TV picture. By 1983, in the face of cable television entering the Chicago market and the economic recession, Spectrum announced its intent to go out of business the following year and sold its subscriber list to competitor ON-TV. By mid-1985, ON-TV also went out of business, and its broadcast UHF channel (WSNS-TV, channel 44) would eventually become an affiliate of Univision and later joined the Telemundo network.|$|E
50|$|SelecTV was {{transmitted}} via <b>scrambled</b> <b>signal</b> {{from a local}} UHF television station. A decoder box was required to unscramble the signal in order to view its programming. SelecTV was available {{in at least three}} markets: in Milwaukee on WCGV (channel 24, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate), in Los Angeles on KWHY-TV (channel 22, now a MundoMax affiliate), and in Philadelphia on WWSG (channel 57, now CW owned-and-operated station WPSG). On WWSG, the service utilized the gated-pulse scrambling technique for the video - and for the audio using technology that would later be used to enable multichannel television sound, moving the audio to a different subcarrier, freeing the standard audio channel for use as a barker channel (which was used for sales promotions). In 1984, New Jersey-based Wometco Home Theater began offering SelecTV on its affiliated television stations after the network ceased programming; however, the affiliation with SelecTV would not last long, as within a year, WHT ceased operations. This occurred following a massive financial collapse, its own {{as a result of a}} majority of their subscribers defecting to cable television services which offered more channels, including pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.|$|E

30|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> {{techniques}} {{differ from}} each other in how the <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> is performed to decrease the PAPR. Reducing PAPR via <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> causes no in-band interferences and MER degradation. However, most of these approaches imply the use of a portion of sub-carriers/bits or transmission of additional information. Furthermore, to obtain the optimum PAPR reduction gain a search of all possible combinations of the bits is needed which requires a high computational effort [11]. In the following, a brief outline of the <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> schemes is given.|$|R
30|$|The strong {{interference}} resiliency of CDMA-based networks is well known[26, 27]. The {{application of}} a <b>scrambling</b> <b>signal</b> with a high chip rate to the transmitted signal spreads the spectrum to levels that, in some cases, can be masked by the thermal noise at the receiver. Upon reception of the signal, application of the same code, orthogonal with the code used in other base stations or UEs, allows to recover the original signal. Due {{to the nature of}} the transmitted signal in UMTS, based on W-CDMA, an interfering signal needs to be transmitted at a very high power in order to jam the communication. This is due to the fact that the process of despreading the signal spectrum at the receiver causes, assuming an interfering signal uncorrelated with the <b>scrambling</b> <b>signal,</b> an inherent reduction of the interference power by log 10 (G) decibels (dBs), being G the spreading factor or processing gain of the W-CDMA signal[26].|$|R

40|$|In 2002, the City of Oakland, California {{implemented}} a <b>scramble</b> <b>signal,</b> {{at the intersection}} of 8 th Street and Webster Street. Scrambles are a type of traffic signal that give pedestrians exclusive access to an intersection by stopping vehicular traffic on all approaches, allowing pedestrians to cross diagonally or conventionally. The primary objective of this evaluation was to determine whether the installation of the pedestrian scramble at this location increased pedestrian safety. An analysis was conducted of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts and pedestrian violations occurring at the intersection before and after the signal was modified, and pedestrians were surveyed to ascertain public attitude toward and comprehension of the change. The modification to <b>scramble</b> <b>signal</b> phasing at the intersection resulted in a statistically significant decrease in conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles, and a statistically significant increase in pedestrian violations. In general, pedestrians understood the change in the way the intersection operated, and were accepting of the change to scramble signalization. These results suggest that the scramble has been effective overall in improving safety conditions at the site. The increased number of violations occurring despite decreased conflicts is in part due to a proportion of pedestrians who cross illegally on the "safe side" crosswalk (i. e. the crosswalk parallel to moving traffic where there are no opportunities for conflicts). It is important that the <b>scramble</b> <b>signal</b> be monitored over time in order to quantify the extent to which reduced vehicle-pedestrian conflicts associated with the scramble translate into measurable reductions in pedestrian injuries and fatalities. pedestrian scramble, pedestrian safety, traffic safety intervention evaluation...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} improve the power {{efficiency}} of OFDM systems, various PAPR reduction techniques have been proposed, which can be categorized into <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> and <b>signal</b> distortion technologies. Signal distortion schemes such as clipping, windowing and peak cancellation reduce peak power at cost of reduced signal quality and usually spectral regrowth. Some <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> schemes such as coding require additional bits to reduce PAPR {{at the cost of}} reduced data rate. Another group of <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> approaches including Selective Level Mapping (SLM), Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS), and Hadamard Transformation either requires side information at the receiver to decode the input signal or modification of the receiver structure; thus, both are not standards compliant. Active constellation extension is another <b>signal</b> <b>scrambling</b> scheme, where the outer points of signal constellations are extended adaptively so that the PAPR of an OFDM symbol is minimized [3 – 5]. This method does not result in throughput and MER loss and thus is of interest for practical use in many OFDM-based systems.|$|R

40|$|Controlling {{the state}} of {{polarization}} of a light beam of an optical fiber is of crucial importance. Non-Linear Polarization Pulling (NLPP) is an all-optical way to control {{the state of}} polarization of signals which has been proposed in recent years. Polarization attraction effect enables to align a generic input State of Polarization (SOP) towards a fixed one. NLPP can be induced by various nonlinear effects occurring in optical fibers, in particular by the Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS). This Thesis is propaedeutic for experiments investigating NLPP. In fact, any experiment on SRS polarization pulling needs a proper polarimeter which can analyze the signals in the wavelength range from 1550 nm to 1640 nm. It is therefore necessary to employ a suitable polarimetric technique which should also give information on the spectral composition of the signals, mainly to estimate the Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) due to the SRS. This polarimeter is tested and characterized in experimental tests performed during this Thesis. Moreover, {{there is also the}} necessity to generate depolarized signals to verify the repolarization capability of the NLPP effect.

40|$|Recently it {{was shown}} that permutation-only {{multimedia}} ciphers can completely be broken in a chosen-plaintext scenario. Apparently, chosen-plaintext scenario models a very resourceful adversary and does not hold in many practical situations. To show that these ciphers are totally broken, we propose a cipher-text only attack on these ciphers. To that end, we investigate speech permutation-only ciphers and show that inherent redundancies of speech signal can pave the path for a successful cipher-text only attack. For this task different concepts and techniques are merged together. First, Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is employed to extract regularities of audio signal in both time and frequency.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 19 - 21, 1979 / Town and Country Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaAnalog {{voice privacy}} {{techniques}} provide {{the advantage of}} being compatible with the 3 kHz audio bandwidth of the existing radio and telephone channels. The degree of privacy provided by an analog voice scrambling technique, however, is proportional to the number of time and frequency elements into which the voice signal can be divided {{as well as to the}} number of permutation patterns according to which the elements are scrambled. This implies the requirement for a high degree of signal-processing capability. Microprocessorbased implementations of an analog voice scrambling device provide a large potential for signal processing and scrambling. Furthermore, they provide this potential at a reasonable cost, small volume and moderate power consumption. In addition, a single microprocessorbased analog voice privacy device can be configured in software to yield various degrees of privacy, depending on a particular use and circumstances. Also, a variety of auxiliary functions such as timing, code generation, synchronization and analog-to-digital conversion can be time-shared within the same microprocessor chip, thus minimizing the requirement for support hardware. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to provide an overview of the existing analog voice privacy techniques, and (2) to specifically outline the capabilities of the microprocessor-based analog voice privacy system design, with a particular emphasis on achieving an analog <b>scrambled</b> <b>signal</b> compatible with the 3 kHz nominal audio bandwidth of the existing radio and telephone channels.

40|$|Digital {{watermarking}} {{has recently}} gained an intense interest {{in research and}} applications. An invisible and secret signal, called watermark, {{is added to the}} host data. With the help of this watermark issuer of the data can be unveiled, unauthorised users can be identified, illicit copying can be avoided, any attempt to temper with the data can be detected and many other security services can be provided. In this thesis, the relations and differences between watermarking and communication systems are elaborated. Based on these results new methods for both watermarking and communication are derived. A new blind, robust and reversible watermarking scheme based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is presented in this thesis. Using this scheme watermark is arithmetically added to spatial domain or frequency domain. Watermark is extracted by using spreading codes only. Proposed watermarking scheme is simple, computationally efficient and can be applied to any image format. A novel idea that watermark can be part of the image is presented. By using watermark, which is a part of an image, digital watermarking can be used beyond simple security tasks. A part of an image is selected and embedded in the whole image as watermark. This watermarked image is attacked (transmitted or compressed). By using the extracted watermark and attacked selected part image quality can be assessed or jpeg quantization ratio can be estimated or even image can be equalized blindly. Furthermore, CDMA based watermarking is used to authenticate radio frequency signal. Spreaded watermark is added in the form of noise to the modulated radio frequency signal. If this noise is increased, watermarked signal automatically becomes a <b>scrambled</b> <b>signal.</b> Later watermark is extracted and by using reversibility of proposed scheme watermark is removed. Once the watermarked is removed original signal is restored, hence descrambled...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The work described in this thesis proposes and investigates further use of scrambling in industrial analogue and digital monochrome video systems. This scrambling inevitably entails some signal modification. Providing the receiver is able {{to distinguish between the}} original and the <b>scrambled</b> <b>signal,</b> regardless of which one was transmitted, more efficient signal exploitation is possible. This more efficient signal exploitation is performed {{at the expense of the}} inherent redundancy present in the analogue and di ital signals. Analogue video signals are usually of a highly correlative nature and, this characteristic is exploited, in this thesis, by enabling them to be unwitting data carriers. The video signal is made the data carrier while the data gets a free ride. Each scan-line of the video signal is sampled, and blocks of pels are scrambled or not by modulo masking, depending on whether the data necessary for transmission is a logical 1 11 or 1 01 respectively. Prior to transmission the combined data and video sequence is converted into a continuous signal with a bandwidth that is no greater than that of the original video signal. From the knowledge of the original and the modified signal statistics, the receiver is able to perform the inverse operation of the transmitter, recovering the video signal and the data. Three novel systems are proposed for embedding data into analogue pictures. Two of these systems are capable of supporting an average of 17430 and 8713 bits per (256 x 256) image LV respectively, with excellent recovered picture quality. The third system produced a constant number of bits per image, with a slight degradation in the recovered picture quality but, with a capability of conveying up to about 0. 5 mega bits/sec of data. The idea and technique of embedding data into analogue signals was then carried on to the digital method of coding video signals using differential pulse code modulation. However, the scrambling technique here was used to obtain a novel switched quantization scheme, with forward estimation, without the necessity of sending any side information. Scrambling was performed on the quantizer output levels by inversion. Initially, experiments were carried out using fixed length code words with one and two dimensional predictors. Blocks of quantizer output levels are scrambled, or not, depending on which quantizer was used in encoding the video signal. Hence the switching information was carried by the quantized block of error signals. This type of set-up produced only modest improvements. The quantizers were then altered by using a different number of levels and the switching information was carried one block of quantized error signals in advance. As a result, the average bit rate was reduced to about 2. 7 bits/pel using a one dimensional predictor with exceptionally good subjective picture quality. When used with a two dimensional predictor, the scheme produced an average bit rate of about 1. 7 bits/pel with excellent subjective picture quality...|$|E
