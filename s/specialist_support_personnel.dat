40|$|A {{national}} survey of institutions treating children with cancer was undertaken in April 1988. The 21 -item questionnaire included questions on personnel, treatment facilities, support services, attitudes and opinions regarding pediatric cancer care. 73 institutions responded. From the survey, it emerged that pediatricians did not see all pediatric patients with cancer at one-third of the respondent institutions. 50 percent of cancer centres did not have pediatricians. Cancer centres were better staffed with specialist personnel and better support services. Respondents felt that pediatric oncologists and <b>specialist</b> <b>support</b> <b>personnel</b> were necessary for optimal pediatric cancer care and facilities at medical colleges needed to be improved {{because of the large}} number of children with cancer treated at these institutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} what the motivational drives are for employees working in an investment bank and whether money plays a roll in motivating employees working for an investment bank. The target group for this study was all the employees who have been in the employment of the target organisation for one year and longer. This group was divided into subgroups of specialist transactors and <b>specialist</b> <b>support</b> <b>personnel.</b> The profile of these two subgroups included a variety of ages, gender, races and educational backgrounds. Data was collected using a questionnaire that was discussed with each employee who agreed to participate in the study. The study clearly illustrates that money can be the primary drive for motivation to certain employees within an investment bank. When one ranks what makes the two subgroups work, it is quite clear that the ability to earn a bonus and the ability to earn more money is highest on the list of specialist transactors, whereas the <b>specialist</b> <b>support</b> <b>personnel</b> enjoys the culture of the bank and has to get job satisfaction to make them work. These results reflect the motivational drives of the sample group at the time of this research. The study concludes that one of the primary motivational aspects for the subgroup of employees which was subject to the empirical study is that these employees are motivated by the mere fact that they can earn more money and a bigger bonus as well as obtaining job satisfaction and having the ability to make their own decisions. The study discussed Maslow’s and McClellands need theories as well as various other motivational theories and approaches employers can introduce to motivate employees. Maslow’s and McClelland’s need theories were directly related to the empirical study with the view whether these two motivational theories can be applied successfully within an investment bank. Based on the results of the empirical study, the researcher came to the conclusion that both these theories can be equally successfully applied to employees working in the target organisation. Dr. K.

40|$|In {{line with}} {{international}} trends in education, South Africa has embraced inclusive education {{as the means}} by which learners who experience barriers to learning will be educated. As inclusion is beginning to be realised in South African schools, a gap in the emerging research base on inclusive education is that of inclusion in the independent sector. A study was undertaken to establish the extent to which learners who experience barriers to learning are included in independent schools belonging to ISASA (the largest independent schools association in South Africa) and the practices that facilitate inclusion. The results of a survey administered to principals were analysed quantitatively and reveal that most ISASA schools include learners who experience various barriers to learning and employ inclusive practices that are described in the international literature. We report on salient aspects emerging from the study and focus on the diversity of learners found in ISASA schools, as well as the inclusive practices found at school-wide, classroom, and individual levels. The practices described are the provision of on-site <b>specialist</b> <b>personnel,</b> <b>support</b> for teachers, building modifications to ensure access by persons using wheelchairs and various instructional practices and assessment adaptations. Recommendations arising from the study may give direction to South African schools pursuing inclusivity. © 2009 EASA...|$|R
