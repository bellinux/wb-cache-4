5|$|As the Khmer Rouge had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Khmer Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E
5|$|In April 2016, Kirchner's {{secretary}} and confidant Daniel Muñoz (who died early that year) was {{identified in the}} Panama Papers as owner of real-estate investment firm Gold Black Limited. Company director Sergio Todisco was investigated by prosecutors who <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company was used for money laundering. At {{the end of the}} year, judge Julián Ercolini indicted Cristina Kirchner and several members of their cabinet, charging them with a criminal conspiracy that would have started when Nestor Kirchner first became president.|$|E
5|$|Lawyers for the {{prosecution}} <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Miguel who had recruited the mercenaries was Michel Dominguez, a Spanish police officer of French origin who worked with Amedo. In April 1990 a waiter at Londres Hotel and a security employee at the Kursaal casino in San Sebastián both stated that they had seen Amedo and Dominguez on various occasions {{in the company of}} Mattei and other GAL mercenaries.|$|E

5|$|Like most crows, {{they will}} {{scavenge}} at landfills, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat {{and other crops}} are a favorite food. These habits have historically caused the American crow {{to be considered a}} nuisance. However, it is <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> harm to crops is offset by the service the American crow provides by eating insect pests.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War the Chain Home radar system began to be installed in the south of England, with three radar stations being operational by 1937. Although the German High Command <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British may have been developing these systems, Zeppelin test flights had proved inconclusive. As a result, the expanding Chain Home radar system, and aircraft-based radar first fielded in 1940, became a vital piece of Britain's defensive capabilities during the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The Old White Hart Inn is Grade II listed, and {{described}} as a late 16th-century building. The building was an end entry house but it is unclear when it became an inn. It has been <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> building was previously used as a courthouse, but this has never been proved. Moreover, tokens were given out under the Old White Hart's name in the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, June 28, Union and Confederate soldiers clashed again {{near the}} Golding house. Jones <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Federals {{near the house}} were withdrawing, and authorized Toombs to perform a reconnaissance-in-force to ascertain whether this was true. However, Toombs turned the reconnaissance operation into a full engagement and advanced with some of Anderson's men. Before he could be countermanded, the Confederates had already been repulsed by the VI Corps.|$|E
5|$|There are doubts, however, {{whether the}} swords {{known to have}} been at Żółkiew in 1738 and at Nieśwież two years later, were in fact the same sword. The Radziwiłłs' castle was plundered by the Russian army in 1812 and the {{subsequent}} fate of their replica of Szczerbiec is unknown. This fact cast doubts over the authenticity of Szczerbiec held in the Hermitage. Some experts <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sword possessed by the Russian imperial museum was in fact the Nieśwież replica, not part of the original royal insignia.|$|E
5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds {{new light on the}} sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E

5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 15 May U-43 opened fire with her deck gun and {{anti-aircraft}} guns on the 488 ton French three-masted sailing ship Notre Dame du Châtelet, en route from St. Malo to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to fish. After being hit by 45 shells the ship sank. Lüth <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vessel was reporting the positions of U-boats to Allied forces, while the 10 survivors thought they had been attacked by a British submarine. They, from her crew of 38, abandoned ship in two lifeboats. Two were picked up by the Italian submarine Otaria on 23 May.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, {{a special}} {{branch of the}} Kempeitai under Lieutenant Colonel Haruzo Sumida was charged with finding the culprits {{responsible}} for acts of sabotage in Singapore, mainly the cutting of telephone lines and the burning of warehouses. Sumida strongly <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> saboteurs were being organised by internees in Changi Prison, and made preparations for a raid on the prison to catch the ringleaders. Sumida's chief suspect was British barrister Rob Heeley Scott, a prominent Foreign Office employee who had previously been detained for his anti-Japanese propaganda, released by the Kempeitai, and then later sent to Changi Prison.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 and 2015 several {{incidents}} involving worker mistreatment surfaced, {{indicating that}} employment agencies often neglect workers' rights or are complicit in {{the cycle of}} abuse; {{there have also been}} many instances of failure to provide service to employers. According to media reports, between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies. Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions provided, {{to the extent that it}} was <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers' experience. The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point. Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate.|$|E

5|$|In April 1987 Reagan {{appointed}} Matlock as Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Conditions at the Embassy were tense, as Marine Sergeant Clayton Lonetree {{had been}} found to have compromised Embassy security. Within a few months of the Lonetree scandal, all U.S. intelligence assets in the Soviet Union had been exposed. The Americans <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> security breach had meant that the Embassy code room was no longer secure and worked frantically to determine how. It was not until 1994 that Aldrich Ames, a mole within the CIA, was caught. Another mole, Robert Hanssen, this time within the FBI, was caught only in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still {{be able to make the}} Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} how the {{described}} genetic defects increase the Na+/K+-ATPase activity, but it is <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> enzyme becomes more active due to increased thyroid hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism increases the levels of catecholamines (such as adrenaline) in the blood, increasing Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The enzyme activity is then increased further by the precipitating causes. For instance, increased carbohydrate intake leads to increased insulin levels; this is known to activate Na+/K+-ATPase. Once the precipitant is removed, the enzyme activity returns to normal levels. It has been postulated that male hormones increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and that this explains why males are at a higher risk of TPP despite thyroid disease being more common in females.|$|E

5|$|It {{is widely}} <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{anaerobic}} bacterial species Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) {{contributes to the}} development of acne, but its exact role is not well understood. There are specific sub-strains of P. acnes associated with normal skin, and moderate or severe inflammatory acne. It is unclear whether these undesirable strains evolve on-site or are acquired, or possibly both depending on the person. These strains have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production, and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores. Infection with the parasitic mite Demodex is associated with the development of acne. It is unclear whether eradication of the mite improves acne.|$|E
5|$|More recently, it {{has been}} <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> western cicada killer {{represents}} more than one species. It co-occurs with the eastern cicada killer (S.speciosus) and Pacific cicada killer (S.convallis) at Big Bend National Park in Texas. There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western cicada killers hunt the same cicada species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the western cicada killer contains two divergent clades, which may represent distinct species. The two clades appeared to be split by the Rocky Mountains, with one occurring mainly {{to the south and}} east, the other to the west.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1975, Catholic civilians Colm McCartney and Sean Farmer {{were stopped}} {{in their car}} at another fake British Army {{checkpoint}} at Altnamachin (near Newtownhamilton). They were driving home from a Gaelic football match in Dublin. The two men were found shot dead nearby. Earlier that night, three RUC officers in an unmarked car had been stopped at the same checkpoint but allowed through. However, the officers <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> checkpoint was fake. After receiving radio confirmation {{that there were no}} authorised checkpoints in the area that night, they reported the incident and requested help from the British Army to investigate it, but no action was taken. RUC officer John Weir claims that UDR corporal Robert McConnell was involved in the attack.|$|E
