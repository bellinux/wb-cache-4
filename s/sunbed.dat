25|$|A {{feature film}} based on The A-Team was {{released}} on June 11, 2010, and was produced by 20th Century Fox. Both Dirk Benedict (Face) and Dwight Schultz (Murdock) made brief cameo appearances in the film (as a prisoner using a <b>sunbed</b> and a psychiatrist overseeing Murdock's shock therapy, respectively); because of timing issues, these scenes were moved {{to the end of}} the credits. They were later reinserted for the extended-cut of the film. It is commonly noted that the scenes were actually removed due to the surviving original cast talking badly about the film not remaining true to the TV series. A director vs actor spat in short.|$|E

In the series finale, Mick admits to Madge that following his decision to purchase cheaper (and unknown to him faulty) tanning lights, the <b>sunbed</b> stores have all been destroyed in fire. To make things worse, Mick also reveals that he had failed to pay insurance on the shops for weeks, resulting in Madge being once again left with nothing. Though Madge is quick to viciously criticize Mick, she is shocked into silence by Michael, who jumps to the defense of his father and puts Madge in her place in the process.|$|E
