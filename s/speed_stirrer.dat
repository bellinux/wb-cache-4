40|$|Presented PhD thesis {{deals with}} {{dissolution}} of amorphous glassy polymers in agitated vessels. Theoretically {{the work is}} based on the description of mass transfer in an agitated vessel, i. e. determination of the relationship for mass-transfer coefficient depending on the respective parameter's in the form of criterial equations. For the description of behaviour of polymers in the process of dissolution a phenomenological model, determining the value of the mutual diffusion coefficient of polymer and solvent depending on the dissolution rate and thickness of the swelling boundary layer in static solvent, is used. The experimental part of work includes determination of the main control mechanism of dissolution of polymeric particles in agitated vessel with baffles and a high <b>speed</b> <b>stirrer</b> placed in the vessel axix. For the six pitched-blade stirrer CSV 691020 and tooth stirrer CSV 691038 a dependance of a mass-transfer coefficient on stirrer speed, particles diameter and concentration of solution is determined. Verification of modelling conditions is based on experiments with two different diameters of vessel, D= 0, 15 and 0, 3 m. Universality for the amorphous polymers is verified experimentally with two polymeric materials, polystyrene and polyvinylchloride dissolved in the thermodynamically suitable solvents. Forms of dependence of the mass-transfer coefficient on parameters, obtained in the experimental part of the thesis, corresponds with the form for dissolution of micromolecular materials, for both turbulent and non-turbulent region. Experimental data are thus interpreted in the form of dimensionless criterial equations determining the mass-transfer coefficient value. The equations obtained in this way can be used for universal description of dissolution of the polymeric articles in the vessels with high speed stirrers.

The product was then analyzed by analysis of swelling power based on the method of Leach (1959),% solubility using the method of Kainuma (1967)., And calculate the temperature gelatinasi. The optimum result obtained shows solubility, swelling power and temperature gelatinasi respectively by 7. 2 %, 3. 8 % and 430 C. The more the volume of HCl is added and the longer time of hydrolysis, the greater the percent solubility and swelling power generated. But this is inversely proportional to the temperature generated gelatinasi. The percentage of solubility and swelling power influenced the interaction between the volume of HCl addition and time of hydrolysis. Increasing the percentage of solubility is directly proportional to the swelling power and inversely proportional to the temperature gelatinasi...|$|E

30|$|To {{overcome}} all this, {{there is}} one major factor which can help eliminate the mass transfer limitations i.e. <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed.</b> The <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> helps to maintain the intra-particle flow by maintaining total flow rate {{and to the extent}} that no shear effect exerts on cells performance as the cells can suffer internal damage during higher <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> that could be attributed to a weaker cell membrane. The poor velocity also can create problems of the concentration gradient, bridging, and channeling, especially when using alginate beads. The ideal flow pattern in any reactor is not always possible, but we can improve and avoid these problems by recognizing optimum factors. The optimized <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> or efficient mixing in a bioreactor has importance in immobilized cell system as it ensures optimal temperature and concentration gradients at the catalyst surface and all heterogeneous catalysis depend on these transport processes since it helps in elimination of CO 2 and ethanol (Armando Gamarra et al. 1986). The results can be supported by Converti et al. 1985 work where they studied the effect of <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> on metabolic activities of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> is a major factor that affects the product yield (Converti et al. 1985).|$|R
30|$|By {{increasing}} agitation {{speed to}} 300 and 500  rpm, glucose consumption time decreases significantly in free cells (15 and 10  h, respectively), alginate beads (12 and 8  h, respectively) and sponge (7 and 6  h, respectively). From these data, we can observe that sponges show no much time difference on both agitation speed as compare to free cells and alginate beads. From these results, we {{can conclude that}} the fluid velocity improves the mass transfer of yeast cells immobilized in different matrixes and the magnitude of mass transfer resistance has an inverse relation with <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed.</b> This is because the <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> controls the internal diffusion of the substrate {{in the case of}} immobilized cells. The sponge-immobilized cells showed less internal diffusion resistance as compare to alginate beads and have less effect at higher <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed.</b> The results in Fig.  3 c support the above observation in which the difference in time of glucose consumption was recorded between free cells (30  h), alginate beads (24  h) and sponges (17  h) at lower <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> (200  rpm) and that tends to decrease (20, 7 and 8  h respectively) at 500  rpm <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed.</b> The higher consumption time in case of free cells might be due to the shear effect of <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed.</b> Moreover, the time difference between sponges and alginate beads might be due to the effect of internal diffusion resistance that can develop concentration gradient inside and on the outer surface of the alginate beads. The concentration gradient is a major problem that can arise in immobilizing technology and it can be improved by using chemically grafted sponges and optimized <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> as shown in above results.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{aeration}} rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> on micro-aerobic fermentation is studied at laboratory scale. Result suggests that with Baker’s yeast, {{an increase in}} aeration rates from very low value can improve bioethanol productivity and yield because it can enhance cell viability. At constant <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> of 150 rpm, the increase in aeration rate from 1 to 1. 5 LPM leads to proportional increase in peak Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR) from 600 to 1000 mM L - 1 h. This increase coincides {{with the increase in}} yield by 7. 5 %. Interestingly at constant aeration rate of 1. 5 LPM, an increase in <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> from 150 to 250 rpm leads to decrease in peak OUR from 1000 to 457 mM L - 1 h but increase in yield by 64 %. In conclusion, both <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> and aeration rate are important factors which have complex impacts on hydrodynamics and microbial metabolism, which in turn affect productivity and yield. Further study using CFD modeling and simulation method is required to gain better insights into how aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> affect metabolism via the mixing mechanisms in a bioreactor...|$|R

Additionally over these experimental conditions, the selectivity of ethanol over glycerol varied from 3. 6 to 12. 3. One conclusion that {{can be drawn from}} this experimental study is that, the large variations in yield, selectivity and ethanol formation rate were more likely due to the different mixing conditions resulting from different values of aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed,</b> and less likely due to glucose and growth rates as previously reported...|$|R

30|$|Figure  3 {{indicate}} {{an effect of}} <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> on free and immobilized cells. Glucose consumption time was higher at lower <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> (200  rpm) both free and immobilized cells due to inefficient mass transfer. To make it efficient substrate should reach the yeast cells by diffusion and convection through the external liquid film, liquid–solid interface, and resistance caused by liquid and micro-colonies of yeast within the particle. The <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> alters the diffusion and convection process of the substrate. If <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> is not enough, the substrate concentration {{on the surface and}} within the matrix will be lower than the concentration in the bulk medium. In this case, {{in the center of the}} matrix, a dead necrotic zone can develop, and only cells biomass around the periphery of the matrix will consume substrate. These reasons support our result that at lower <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> cells take a longer time to consume glucose. Yeast cell viability and metabolism is also severely affected by mass transfer properties. Therefore, glucose and other nutrients in fermentation medium must diffuse to the yeast cells and product or other metabolites should diffuse out into the medium otherwise these could be toxic or show inhibition to cells and can decrease cell productivity (Pilkington et al. 1998). While increasing the <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> to 300  rpm and 500  rpm, glucose consumption time tends to decrease at all glucose concentration (50, 100, and 200  g/l). The results clearly indicate that there is less concentration gradient, as substrate traveled easily to the reaction site of yeast cells and is consumed as faster as it is provided by the diffusion process. On the other hand, the shear effect of higher <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> (even at 500  rpm) has been observed in Fig.  3 c indicating that the time for glucose consumption is higher in the case of free cells as compare to alginate beads and sponges. The higher consumption time in case of free cells confirmed the shear effect of <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> as well as the glucose. Mechanical stress (shear stress) is one of the factors having an impact on yeast cell wall and its functionality like reduction in viability and vitality. In traditional ethanol fermentation technology, freely suspended yeast cells were used in the batch. Moreover, several drawbacks are found in this technology like more fermentation time and low volumetric productivity, due to continuous changes in the external physical factors and biological activity of yeast. To achieve optimal conditions for metabolic activity, yeast must maintain the intracellular physical and chemical parameters (Bauer and Pretorius).|$|R

Thus, the measurements are done under repeatable stationary conditions, so no Doppler shift is present during the actual measurements. Still, this letter shows that the measured S-parameters in step-wise stationary mode {{can be used to}} determine Doppler spread appearing during continuous movement of the stirrers. This can be done by computation for any <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> by assuming that the fixed stirrer position steps are the time steps of a continuous movement of the stirrers, and by adding a virtual <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> between the positions corresponding to the desired continuous movement of the stirrers.

40|$|Mixing plays a {{substantial}} {{role in determining}} the overall performance of a bioreactor. Well mixing in bioreactor, especially for ethanolic fermentation process is important for the homogenization of miscible and immiscible liquids, gas dispersion and suspension of solid particles. Improper mixing will eventually affect the biological and kinetics reactions occurring in the bioreactor and subsequently deteriorate the bioreactor performance. Currently, most modeling and control applications of bioreactors have been devoted to ideally mixed assumption, for simplicity. This is not realistic in practical applications. Furthermore, the strength and accuracy of the bioreactor models reflect their performance and subsequently its control strategy. Therefore, it is vital to consider the imperfect mixing for the control of bioreactor. In this study, a batch, micro-aerobic bioreactor for ethanolic fermentation process will be considered for modeling. Up to date, not much study has been conducted in exploiting the mixing mechanism for controlling this type of bioreactor. Traditionally, only the bioreactor conditions such as temperature and pH are controlled for such a batch bioreactor. Other parameters, such as aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> are not used to control the bioreactor. Thus, it is difficult to improve the bioreactor performance as the bioreactor performance is less sensitive to both temperature and pH than to the mixing mechanism. However, the mixing behaviour of the bioreactor needs to be captured if we are to employ both aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> for the control of such a batch bioreactor. It is known that aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> could significantly affect the biological and kinetics reactions. Therefore, both aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> are suggested in this work as manipulated variables in the modeling of batch bioreactor. Thus, with this approach the ideally mixed assumption will be relaxed. The models proposed will be implemented for control studies. New control strategies will be established for continuous bioreactor, whereby dilution rate and substrate concentration are considered as disturbance variables and both aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> are suggested as manipulated variables. With this approach, the practicability of the proposed models could be investigated. The aims of this research have therefore been as follows: 1. To experimentally study the impact of aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> on the bioreactor performances, i. e. yield and productivity. 2. To develop an integrated bioreactor model to allow us to employ the aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> as manipulated variables for control design. 3. To establish new control strategies for bioreactor without the ideally mixed assumption. A systematic approach has been proposed to develop the non-ideally mixed bioreactor model and to design the control strategy of the lab-scale fermentation process. Three modeling approaches are employed, i. e. data-based, kinetics hybrid and kinetics multi-scale models for the analysis of the impacts of both aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> on the performance of bioreactor. Using the three models, the aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> are also used to analyze the mixing mechanism in the bioreactor. Furthermore, new control strategies are then proposed for the bioreactor. By using the proposed control strategies, the effect of both aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> on the overall performance could be analyzed in the face of disturbances on other process parameters. Furthermore, the stability and achievable performance of the control strategies could be compared for different models. Hence, the proposed control strategies would lead to a better operation of the bioreactor. The study highlighted the following main findings: 1. It is identified that both aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> could affect significantly the overall performance of the bioreactor. Therefore, both aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> rather than temperature and pH could be used as manipulated variables for controlling the bioreactor. The ideally mixed assumption is relaxed where the mixing mechanism of the bioreactor is included in the proposed model. 2. The main issue in modeling is the complexity of the microbial reactions and kinetics of the bioreactor performance for the non-ideally mixed behaviour of the bioreactor. Thus, it is important to identify the main reactions and kinetics which actually affect the bioreactor performance. In this study, Monod’s kinetics has been employed with the implementation of both aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed.</b> It is shown that the kinetics multi-scale model demonstrated good predictions of the mixing mechanism of bioreactor. Different conditions of aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> influence the mixing mechanism and thus, contribute to the dynamics and kinetics within the bioreactor. These show that both aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> play important role in studying the non-ideally mixed mechanism of the bioreactor. 3. Optimization results, however, suggest that the kinetics hybrid model gives the most comparable values of maximum yield and productivity. Thus, this model is suggested for the determination of the optimum conditions of the bioreactor operation due to its simplicity in model construction, as compared to the kinetics multi-scale model. 4. The control strategy of bioreactor using the data-based model does not always produce good performance, especially in the face of large disturbances. This implies that the use of models with ideally mixed assumptions would not always give good overall performance. Therefore, the controllability of the bioreactor performance is further improved with the implementation of the proposed non-ideally mixed bioreactor model. It is observed that both databased and kinetics hybrid models are able to keep the controlled variables in their set-point values by manipulating both aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> for low disturbance changes. Hence, this research contributes on the understanding of mixing phenomena in micro-aerobic fermentation process from which a set of optimal operational conditions and control strategies to enhance its performance are developed...|$|R

The higher performance of glucose conversion time {{was observed in}} SCBBR than STR reactor. Free cells were observed to take approximately double the time (20  h) to finish one batch process compared to immobilized cells [alginate (7  h) and sponges (8  h)]. With lower <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed,</b> ethanol yield and glucose conversion time were observed as limited by external diffusional resistance. The diffusivity of glucose through boundary layer surrounding the biocatalyst particle {{plays a major role}} in achieving maximum ethanol yield that is directly controlled by the structure of immobilizing matrix and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> of a bioreactor. The medium hydrodynamics in bioreactors exhibit an important influence on glucose conversion and transfer processes (Galaction et al. 2012).|$|R

It was inoculated into a 5 L bioreactor (Sartorius Stedim, Germany) with 3 L PY medium (with glycerol or, respectively, saccharide). According to Myszka et al. (2012), a blanket of a high-purity grade gas mixture of 5 % O 2 and 95 % CO 2 was maintained through 24 h. Gas flow rate was at up to 1.0 L/min only. During the first 24 h of cultivation the level of 5 % of oxygen was automatically maintained (the <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> varied between 200 and 500 rpm). After 24 h of the duration of the process the <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> was regulated to a constant value of 200 rpm. The fermentation was run at 30 °C for 7 days.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} multi-scale models for a batch bioreactor, which are {{developed}} by expanding the so-called Herbert’s Microbial Kinetics (HMK) concept {{so that the}} effects of mixing conditions are incorporated via the inclusion of the aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> into the microbial kinetics. By using the multi-scale models, we are able to optimize the batch bioreactor’s performances, i. e. yield and productivity, by adjusting the aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed.</b> Simulation and experimental studies on a batch (fermentation) bioreactor demonstrate the application of this approach, whereby the integration of the expanded HMK model with the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of mixing, which we call it as a Kinetics Multi-Scale (KMS) model, is able to predict the experimental values of yield and productivity of the batch fermentation process accurately (with less than 5 % errors) ...|$|R

40|$|The auto {{oxidation}} of coal ultimately {{leads to}} spontaneous combustion {{which is the}} major root cause for the disastrous of coal mine. It {{has been a major}} problem in the leading coal producing countries like Australia, India and China. Therefore the assessment for this combustion is very much necessary. It depends upon different characteristics and properties of coal. Once if the combustion of coal has been occurred, {{it is very difficult to}} control which also disturbs the environment of the surroundings of the mine. The spontaneous heating susceptibility of different coals varies over a wide range and it is important to assess their degree of proneness for taking preventive measures against the occurrence of fires to avoid loss of lives and property, sterilization of coal reserves and environmental pollution and raise concerns about safety and economic aspects of mining etc [3]. This project deals with the spontaneous heating tendency of coal using wet oxidation apparatus at various <b>speed</b> of magnetic <b>stirrer.</b> Five coals samples were collected from central Coalfields Limited (CCL) Limited and two coals from Mahanadi coal Limited (MCL) covering some coalfields of India.
