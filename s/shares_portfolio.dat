Such needs have led to specific segments of demand and supply that demand for money and the money supply, in particular capital. Were created following specific markets: financial markets, with specialized division of labour in money markets and capital markets. Capital market is to supply and demand for medium and long term capital, with the same role as the financial market in general, having featured the long duration of maturity. From the viewpoint of the agents involved two types of markets that is the primary market, which are negotiated in the presence of primary and secondary securities issuer, that and his participation, and market secondary market investors, financial flows are directed to a investor to another. Institution typical secondary capital market is the stock market. Coverage of financial instruments, according to EU directives in force, is broad, including both tradable capital market instruments and money market instruments. Investment is defined in national accounts as gross fixed capital formation is the value of durable goods purchased by the production units to be used at least one year in production processes. The investment flow is therefore measured over a period, often a year, noted that the yield from an investment is proportional to the risk assumed.

40|$|Investment in {{agribusiness}} assets {{has grown}} significantly in recent years. The question {{of interest is}} whether including agribusiness assets in investment portfolios provide benefits. The effects of diversification by including agribusiness assets in two investment portfolios, a mixed asset portfolio and a diversified <b>share</b> <b>portfolio</b> was investigated using Markowitz’s (1952) Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) of mean-variance optimization. To measure the performance of agribusiness assets, an index of agribusiness companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange was used. The {{results of the study}} suggested that agribusiness assets provided some diversification benefits in both the mixed asset and diversified <b>share</b> <b>portfolio.</b> The benefits of including agribusiness assets in a mixed asset portfolio were shown to be more significant than in a diversified <b>share</b> <b>portfolio.</b> Allocations of agribusiness assets in the portfolios tended to increase with portfolio risk, up to a peak of 32. 10 % agribusiness assets in the mixed asset portfolio, with allocations tending to decrease with increasing risk in the diversified <b>share</b> <b>portfolio,</b> peaking at a 17. 72 % allocation in the minimum risk portfolio. For both the portfolios analysed, agribusiness assets entered efficient portfolios at the minimum risk portfolio. 1...|$|R

Its title is “Analysis of Formation and selection of Optimum <b>share</b> <b>Portfolio</b> On Syariah <b>Shares</b> registered in JII”. The purpose of this {{research is}} to analyze optimum <b>share</b> <b>portfolio</b> formation and selection on Syariah shares registered in JII. Analysis instrument to determine and to choose optimum <b>share</b> <b>portfolio</b> on Syariah <b>shares</b> in JII uses Single Index Model. The measuring rod to determine the share involvement in optimum portfolio is if it has relative stable share price ascent, positive beta value, positive excess return to beta (ERB) and ERB ≥ cut off point (C*). The Calculation result using single index model from 22 shares JII including as the candidate of optimum <b>share</b> <b>portfolio</b> formation is obtained 8 <b>shares</b> forming optimum <b>portfolio</b> with each proportion are LSIP (38. 63 %), INDF (19. 94 %), ADHI (6. 31 %), BUMI (24. 93 %), KIJA (4. 89 %), ANTM (1. 83 %), UNTR (1. 47 %), GJTL (2. 02 %).

From the analysis result by using the single index model, and appropriate with the used measuring rod, hence the optimum <b>share</b> <b>portfolio</b> formation and selection has formed. Thus, the Hypotesis {{of this research is}} proven. The writer can implicate that investors should be careful and precise in choosing share located on optimum portfolio series.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify some aspects of geared {{investments}} which are investments partially financed from a loan. Gearing is a standard tool of investment and although it is usually applied to property or <b>share</b> <b>portfolios,</b> the approach can be applied to any asset. Some investors are resistant to it because they think it is risky, but the same people have often made large leveraged investments in the family home. The second section of the paper outlines the basics of gearing and the factors that affect the return earned on a leveraged asset holding. The third section demonstrates that a <b>share</b> <b>portfolio</b> can contain "hidden leverage". The fourth section looks at margin loans.

40|$|Summary: Investment {{management}} on {{the capital}} market is a complex and multifarious process and the accuracy of decisions is an indispensable condition that an investor needs to fulfill if the expected economic results are to be achieved. The paper presents {{the concept of the}} optimization of investment portfolio {{on the capital}} market of shares. The maximum value of portfolio quality measure was used as an optimization criterion. It is expressed by the index of variability R/σ of the rate of return for each <b>share</b> in the <b>portfolio.</b> The cumulation of values of R/σ index in the successive years of the investigated period allowed for an econometric estimation of the continuous functions and their maximum. The indexes of asymmetry of rate of return for particular <b>shares</b> in the <b>portfolio</b> were introduced into the functions, which enabled to increase the efficiency of the selection of <b>shares</b> for the <b>portfolio.</b> This, in turn, allowed to achieve the optimum structure of <b>shares</b> in the <b>portfolio...</b>|$|R
