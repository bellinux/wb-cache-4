50|$|Producer Jack F. Murphy saw the {{original}} <b>Scared</b> <b>to</b> <b>Death</b> {{and was so}} impressed with the monster that he wanted to make another film utilizing the same monster design.

This is why there is no character or plot carry-over from <b>Scared</b> <b>to</b> <b>Death</b> other than the monster. <b>Scared</b> <b>to</b> <b>Death</b> director William Malone was asked and was originally going to direct this sequel. Malone ended up passing on the project as he had an opportunity to direct Creature, however he participated in creating the film's monster costumes.|$|R
