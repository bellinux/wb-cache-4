5|$|SS El <b>Sol</b> was a {{cargo ship}} built in 1910 for the Morgan Line, a {{subsidiary}} of the Southern Pacific Company. During World War I, she was known as USAT El <b>Sol</b> in service with the United States Army and as USS El <b>Sol</b> (ID-4505) in service with the United States Navy. At the end of war, she reverted to her original name of SS El <b>Sol.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Sol</b> and Naz {{spend the}} night {{together}} but at later dance rehearsals, Asher gives Naz her necklace back, and <b>Sol</b> sees this. He confronts Naz about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. <b>Sol</b> punches Asher, saying his brother has betrayed him, and a fight breaks out, but is broken up by Skolla and the other dancers. Skolla tells <b>Sol</b> and Asher they are both out {{of the group and}} reveals that Asher bought Sol's place. <b>Sol</b> goes back home to his mother but a neighbour tells him she has been taken away. Back in Walford, Naz insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. Stevie attempts to get them to reconcile by locking them in the flat and pretending to swallow the key, but Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and <b>Sol</b> says she can stay there. <b>Sol</b> and Naz get close again but Asher interrupts them when he returns drunk. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and <b>Sol</b> thinks Naz was in on the plan so he tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. Asher finds <b>Sol</b> with their mother in hospital, and tells <b>Sol</b> he is better off with him than their mother as she is schizophrenic and has stabbed Asher. <b>Sol</b> says Asher is the problem and leaves. Asher finds him and apologises for Naz and says she did not get Sol's text message because he deleted it, and tells <b>Sol</b> that Naz loves him and he should do something about it. <b>Sol</b> returns to Walford again as Naz is leaving, and stops Ekin's car. Naz gets out and they kiss. Asher tells him he can dance at the dance-off, but when his name is called, he is unsure and calls for Asher, saying he needs him. Asher tells him he can do it on his own. Everyone cheers him after his routine and he is called one of the best dancers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sol</b> is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to <b>Sol</b> since a young age, and <b>Sol</b> depends on him. Looking after <b>Sol</b> takes a toll on Asher, however. <b>Sol</b> is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. <b>Sol</b> likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and <b>Sol</b> wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so <b>Sol</b> can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that <b>Sol</b> would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for <b>Sol,</b> but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for <b>Sol.</b> Cole said that <b>Sol</b> is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. <b>Sol</b> does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with <b>Sol</b> throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sol</b> quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. <b>Sol</b> {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like <b>Sol</b> before either. Hussen said {{that there is something}} about <b>Sol</b> that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that <b>Sol</b> is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and <b>Sol</b> depends on him. Looking after <b>Sol</b> takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between <b>Sol</b> and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have to}} act much for it. <b>Sol</b> has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E

40|$|A rapid, wash-free highly {{sensitive}} detection method for C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is reported with both triangular silver nanoplate (TSNP) and Au-edge coated TSNP biosensor <b>sols.</b> The latter shows higher assay sensitivity {{as well as}} excellent stability under assay conditions including centrifugation and salinity. A series of Au derived TSNP <b>sols</b> including Au-edge-coated TSNP, AuAg nanomesh and nanobox derived <b>sols</b> are examined as statistically representative saline-stable enhanced ensemble local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) refractive index sensitive sensors. Samples with plasmon bands spanning the biological spectral window are prepared showing enhancement compared with the original TSNP <b>sols.</b> Refractive index sensitivities as high as 1816 nm RIU? 1 are exhibited by Au-edge-coated TSNP <b>sols.</b> The priority of ensemble refractive index sensitivity values over figures of merit in characterising these <b>sols</b> is examined using discrete dipole approximation calculations and single nanostructure dark field microscopy measurements.
