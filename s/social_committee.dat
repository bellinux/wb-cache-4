5|$|The Consultative Committee (similar to the Economic and <b>Social</b> <b>Committee)</b> had between 30 and 50 members equally {{divided between}} producers, workers, {{consumers}} and dealers {{in the coal}} and steel sector. Again, there were no national quotas, and the treaty required representatives of European associations to organise their own democratic procedures. They were to establish rules to make their membership fully representative for democratic organised civil society. Membership were appointed {{for two years and}} were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The Committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president. Again, the required democratic procedures were not introduced and nomination of these members remained in the hands of national ministers. The High Authority was obliged to consult the Committee in certain cases where it was appropriate and to keep it informed. The Consultative Committee remained separate (despite the merger of the other institutions) until 2002, when the Treaty expired and its duties were taken over by the Economic and <b>Social</b> <b>Committee</b> (ESC). Despite its independence, the Committee did cooperate with the ESC when they were consulted on the same issue.|$|E

25|$|In September 1951, Andrzej Szwalbe {{has been}} {{appointed}} director of the Pomeranian Philharmonic Orchestra, which was nationalized in December 1952: on January 1, 1953, the orchestra was renamed National Pomeranian Philharmonic in Bydgoszcz. Already in February 1953, attempts {{to have a new}} philharmonic concert hall have been made, and thanks to the efforts of the <b>Social</b> <b>Committee</b> for the Philharmonic Building, on June 26, 1954 the ceremony laying the foundation stone of the edifice at Libelta street 16 happened. The construction was completed in autumn 1958: the new building was spacious, had a convenient location, and most of all have a concert hall with rare acoustic conditions. On November 16, 1958 a gala concert marking the opening of the new building was held, led by Zbigniew Chwedczuk. During the following days an occasional music festival took place, with concerts were in Bydgoszcz, Torun and Włocławek. At the same time, the Philharmonic was christened Ignacy Jan Paderewski, whose half-brother Józef lived in Bydgoszcz from 1926 until his death in 1958.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} to follow, various {{national}} and regional initiatives and projects were formed.

However, there are few if any figures on the uptake of Integrated Farming in the major crops throughout Europe for example, leading to a recommendation by the European Economic and <b>Social</b> <b>Committee</b> in February 2014, that the EU should carry out an in-depth analysis of integrated production in Europe {{in order to obtain}} insights into the current situation and potential developments. There is evidence, however, that between 60 and 80% of pome, stone and soft fruits were grown, controlled and marketed according to “Integrated Production Guidelines” in 1999 already in Germany for example. In the UK, 22% of fresh fruit and vegetables are grown to Integrated Farm Management standards as recognised by the LEAF Marque.|$|E

25|$|The European Parliament heard {{testimony}} about organ harvesting in China during a 6 December 2012 session {{on human rights}} in China. One year later, it passed a resolution expressing “deep concern over the persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the People’s Republic of China, including from large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners imprisoned for their religious beliefs, {{as well as from}} members of other religious and ethnic minority groups.” The resolution called for the immediate release of all prisoners of conscience, and urged Chinese authorities to respond to United Nations inquiries about the source of organs used in transplants. In March 2014, the European Economic and <b>Social</b> <b>Committee</b> in Brussels convened a follow-up event on organ transplant abuses in China. Participants and speakers at the session endorsed the recommendations of the parliamentary resolution, which recognized that Falun Gong and other minority groups are targets of forced organ harvesting in China. EESC President Henri Malosse called for greater pressure to be put on the Chinese government to end organ transplant abuses.|$|E
500|$|The Commission {{was set up}} {{from the}} start {{to act as an}} {{independent}} supranational authority separate from governments; it has been described as [...] "the only body paid to think European".

This is in contrast to the Council, which represents governments, the Parliament, which represents citizens, the Economic and <b>Social</b> <b>Committee,</b> which represents organised civil society, and the Committee of the Regions, which represents local and regional authorities.|$|E
