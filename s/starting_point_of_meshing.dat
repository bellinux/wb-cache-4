However, the present study evaluated the root stress taking into account the load-sharing ratio.|$|R
40|$|Torsional {{spring-loaded}} antibacklash gear {{which can}} improve the transmission precision is widely used in many precision transmission fields. It {{is very important to}} investigate the dynamic characteristics of antibacklash gear. In the paper, applied force analysis is completed in detail. Then, defining the <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> double-gear <b>meshing</b> as initial position, according to the <b>meshing</b> characteristic <b>of</b> antibacklash gear, single- or double-tooth <b>meshing</b> states <b>of</b> two gear pairs and the transformation relationship at any moment are determined. Based on this, a nonlinear model of antibacklash gear with time-varying friction and meshing stiffness is proposed. The influences of friction and variations of torsional spring stiffness, damping ratio and preload on dynamic transmission error (DTE) are analyzed by numerical calculation and simulation, and the results show that antibacklash gear can increase the composite meshing stiffness; when the torsional spring stiffness is large enough, the oscillating components of the DTE (ODTE) and the RMS of the DTE (RDTE) trend to be a constant value; the variations of ODTE and RDTE are not significant, unless preload exceeds a certain value...|$|R
40|$|An {{automatic}} adaptive quadrilateral mesh {{conversion scheme}} for the generation <b>of</b> adaptive refinement <b>meshes</b> over analytical curved surfaces is proposed. The <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the quadrilateral <b>mesh</b> generator is a background triangular <b>mesh</b> <b>of</b> the curved surface. By a carefully controlled process to merge two triangles {{at a time}} the triangular mesh can be completely converted to quadrilaterals. A rapidly graded quadrilateral mesh with node spacing compatible with the desired element size distribution {{can be obtained from}} a well-graded triangular <b>mesh.</b> The quality <b>of</b> the quadrilateral <b>mesh</b> can be subsequently enhanced by a series <b>of</b> <b>mesh</b> modifications and element shape improvement procedures. The present scheme can be used in conjunction with an adaptive surface triangular mesh generator to generate quadrilateral meshes suitable for adaptive shell refinement analysis. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.

Compound Trill is based on the term Compound Ornaments. used by Arnold Dolmetsch in Chapter 4, Section 13 of his book "The Interpretation of the Music of the XVII & XVIII Centuries". The following categories, resulting from the rhythmic relationship of an ornament to the principal note or notes, are defined as follows: Beat is the notated <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the principal note. Onbeat ornaments displace the <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the principal note. The entry of the Principal note is therefore delayed. Anticipated or prebeat ornaments precede their principal note and leave the <b>starting</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> their principal notes in place. Interbeat ornaments are equally linked to both neighbouring notes and inserted between the <b>starting</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> both neighbour notes...|$|R
