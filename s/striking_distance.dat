5|$|Young {{individuals}} have yellowish or greenish tail tips {{and engage in}} caudal luring. The tail tip is wriggled to lure prey, such as frogs and lizards, within <b>striking</b> <b>distance.</b> Wharton (1960) observed captive specimens exhibiting this behavior between 07:20 and 19:40 hours, which suggests it is a daytime activity.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of the fish.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{lightning}} strike hazards may be properly managed {{by using a}} lightning detector system. In this paper, a system to determine the lightning <b>strike</b> <b>distance</b> from the measuring point was developed and tested. The time-tothunder method {{was used to determine}} the <b>strike</b> <b>distance.</b> The technique was implemented using two kinds of sensors, namely, a broadband antenna to detect the electric field, and a microphone to detect the acoustic signal produced when {{lightning strike}} to the ground. A simple procedure to find the <b>strike</b> <b>distance</b> (d) was explained. A broadband parallel plate antenna was used to detect the electric field signal. The acoustic signal was detected by a microphone. The arrival time-delay between both signals was used to calculate the <b>strike</b> <b>distance.</b> The LabVIEW 8. 5 software was used as a data logger to calculate the distance and to save the data. The lightning distance data were recorded for duration from January 2010 until March 2010 using the developed system. The range of the lightning detection is up to 10 km in radius...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{quantitative}} analysis of tentacle extension in squid that integrates several levels of structural organization. The muscular stalks {{of the two}} tentacles of squid are rapidly elongated by 70 per cent of resting length during prey capture. A typical duration of the extension is 30 ms in Loligo pealei (with a contracted tentacle length of 93 mm and a <b>strike</b> <b>distance</b> of about 37 mm). In a successful strike, the terminal clubs hit the prey and attach to it via arrays of suckers...|$|R

40|$|Sand vipers of {{the genus}} Cerastes are {{specialized}} semifossorial snakes that launch predatory strikes at rodents and lizards while partially buried in the soft sand of the Saharan desert. This study attempted to document which environmental stimuli are used by these snakes as a trigger for the ambush behavior. Denervating the olfactory and vomeronasal organs produced no changes in prey capture behavior in Cerastes cerastes. Occluding {{the eyes of the}} denervated specimens resulted in significant decreases in <b>strike</b> <b>distance,</b> diversity of <b>strike</b> angle and strike accuracy, demonstrating the importance of visual stimuli for target acquisition in this species. Nevertheless, every olfactory-denervated, temporarily blinded specimen succeeded in capturing free-ranging mice in every trial...|$|R
5000|$|In <b>Striking</b> <b>Distances</b> case, for example, all the love/intimate scenes between Hardy and Jo were re-shot to {{make them}} sexier. Several {{dialogue}} scenes, such as {{the scene in the}} bar between Willis and Sizemore, were also cut to make the film's pace quicker. The change in tone made Columbia change the title from [...] "Three Rivers" [...] to [...] "Striking Distance," [...] as it now focused more on the action/thriller elements. Although his interference in the script and huge ego during filming caused problems with the production and the original cut, Willis was still very angry because he had to return for re-shoots, so much so that he blamed Herrington for it, despite the fact that Herrington defended Willis in interviews regarding problems with the film. According to cast and crew, Willis treated Herrington very poorly during both initial filming and re-shoots.|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{defensive}} strike of one species {{of each of}} five recognized lineages within the genus Bothrops, namely, B. alternatus, B. jararaca, B. jararacussu, B. moojeni and B. pauloensis. The defensive strike of the studied species was in general {{similar to that of}} Crotalus viridis and C. atrox, but some important differences were observed. Bothrops alternatus and B. pauloensis struck preferentially from a tight body posture, whereas B. jararaca and B. moojeni from a loose body posture. Defensive strikes were either true or false (during the latter, the mouth remains closed or partially open). Almost all strikes were successful; only on a few occasions snakes missed their target (flawed strikes). Strike variables were very conservative among the five species, especially <b>strike</b> <b>distance</b> and height, and one possible explanation may be related to constraints imposed on strike variables as a way of increasing strike accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Landscape level {{wildfire}} prediction {{can be used}} {{to allocate}} wildfire resources and guide land management practices. Wildfire prediction in arid habitats in the Southwestern United States is of specific concern because of the negative ecological impacts of fire on desert habitats and the current lack of accurate fire prediction tools for such areas. This study examines the ability to predict previous fire occurrences and estimate future fire potential using satellite imagery and on the ground field survey techniques along with ignition potential data (lightning <b>strikes</b> and <b>distance</b> to roads), topographical data (elevation and aspect), and climate information (maximum and minimum temperatures). The satellite data was used to create a suite of potential fuel load models that were then evaluated for the best fit models using AIC model selection. The best fit fuel load model (Fuel Load Model 1) was then used in conjunction with 2005 remote sensing and fire occurrence data to predict fire potential for that year. Fuel load Model 1 along with spring Fuel Moisture Content (FMC), lightning <b>strikes,</b> <b>distance</b> to roads, and perennial vegetation type were modeled and a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the agreement between model predictions and actual fire occurrence. The ROC evaluation rendered an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0. 90 indicating accurate prediction of fire occurrence for 2005. This study provides evidence that remote sensing techniques can be used in combination with field surveys to accurately predict wildfire potential in Mojave Desert habitats...|$|R

5|$|Before {{they could}} deploy, the two mounted {{divisions}} of Desert Mounted Corps had to ride between , {{to bring them}} within <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of Beersheba at dawn on 31 October. Chauvel arrived at the Asluj Desert Mounted Corps headquarters during the afternoon of 30 October, when arrangements were completed for {{the continuation of the}} marches by the Anzac and Australian Mounted Divisions. The Anzac Mounted Division was at Asluj, the Australian Mounted Division was at Khalasa (three hours' march behind) and the 7th Mounted Brigade was at Bir el Esani. The No. 11 Light Armoured Motor Battery (LAMB) was sent ahead of the Anzac Mounted Division to a position on the north slopes of the Gebel el Shereif to guard their flank as they moved forward. The divisional headquarters at Asluj closed at 17:30, and the last Anzac divisional troops left the railway station a half-hour later.|$|E
5|$|Moscow {{itself was}} also hastily fortified. According to Zhukov, 250,000 women and {{teenagers}} worked building trenches and anti-tank moats around Moscow, moving almost three million {{cubic meters of}} earth with no mechanical help. Moscow's factories were hastily converted to military tasks: one automobile factory {{was turned into a}} submachine gun armory, a clock factory manufactured mine detonators, the chocolate factory shifted to food production for the front, and automobile repair stations worked fixing damaged tanks and military vehicles. Despite these preparations, the capital was within <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of German tanks, with the Luftwaffe mounting large-scale air raids on the city. The air raids caused only limited damage because of extensive anti-aircraft defenses and effective civilian fire brigades.|$|E

Though Dunlevy had two chances for field goals, one fell short and the other was blocked.|$|E
40|$|The {{body shape}} of {{seahorses}} resembles {{the head and}} neck of horses because of their curved trunk, their ventrally bent head and their long snout. Seahorses evolved from ancestral, pipefish-like species, which have a straight body. Here, we use a biomechanical analysis and show that the seahorse's peculiar head, neck and trunk posture allows for the capture of small shrimps at larger distances from the eyes compared with pipefish. The results from the mathematical modelling were confirmed by kinematic data of prey-capturing syngnathids: compared with straight-bodied pipefish, all seahorse species studied consistently show an additional forward-reaching component in the path travelled by the mouth during their strikes at prey. This increased <b>strike</b> <b>distance</b> enlarges the volume of water they can probe for food, which is especially useful for tail-attached, sit-and-wait predators like seahorses. The biomechanics of prey capture thus provides a putative selective advantage that may explain the bending of the trunk into a horse-like shape...|$|R

40|$|The {{decline of}} the Oregon Spotted Frog (Rana pretiosa), a Pacific Northwest endemic now federally listed as threatened, has been {{attributed}} to several aspects of ecosystem alteration, primarily habitat degradation and loss. The introduced American Bullfrog (Rana (Aquarana) catesbeiana) has been widely implicated in those declines, but the basis of that contention has been difficult to characterize. The bullfrog occurring at every site of recent Oregon Spotted Frog extirpation has focused concern about its impact. Here, I present a suite of interconnected studies that examine the behavioral ecology of both species to better understand the potential for bullfrog-mediated Oregon Spotted Frog extirpation. I quantified Oregon Spotted Frog anti-predator behavior from the only known population successfully co-occurring with bullfrogs (Conboy Lake) and a population devoid of bullfrog impact (Big Marsh), and compared these behaviors to the predatory traits of the bullfrog. The initial study revealed that captive-reared individuals from the Oregon Spotted Frog population that has successfully co-occurred with bullfrogs respond faster to a predatory stimulus (measured as latency to response) than Oregon Spotted Frogs from a population not to exposed to bullfrogs. Subsequent field investigations of the approach distance allowed by a predator stimulus before taking evasive action (termed the flight initiation distance: FID) conducted with the Oregon Spotted Frog population co-occurring with bullfrogs first demonstrated that FID of recently metamorphosed bullfrogs is consistently greater than that of recently metamorphosed Oregon Spotted Frogs. Further, examination of FID across all post-metamorphic age classes of Oregon Spotted Frogs revealed that older frogs do not allow as close approach as recently metamorphosed Oregon Spotted Frogs. This age class shift in FID did not occur in the Oregon Spotted Frog population not exposed to bullfrogs. In the latter population, FID did not differ among age classes. Since the bullfrog might be driving this age-based change in anti-predator behavior, I explored the variation in <b>strike</b> <b>distance</b> of bullfrogs from the site of co-occurrence in both the field and laboratory {{to determine the extent of}} overlap with Oregon Spotted Frog FID. I found that the bullfrog <b>strike</b> <b>distance</b> significantly overlaps the FID of all ages of Oregon Spotted Frogs from the bullfrog-free site but only that of youngest (recently metamorphosed) frogs at the site of co-occurrence. Older Oregon Spotted Frogs from the site of co-occurrence generally escaped at distances greater than the <b>strike</b> <b>distance</b> of bullfrogs. I also collected 3 ̆e 880 bullfrogs from the site of co-occurrence and analyzed the stomach contents to assess their dietary trends. I found that bullfrogs consume Oregon Spotted Frogs at the site, but do not eat the larger (older) frogs. Moreover, the body size ratio between Oregon Spotted Frogs as prey and bullfrogs as predators suggests that nearly all of the adult size distribution of bullfrogs at Conboy would be incapable of preying on adult Oregon Spotted Frogs. Collectively, these studies strongly suggest that bullfrogs have altered the escape behavior of Oregon Spotted Frogs at Conboy Lake and that most adult Oregon Spotted Frogs at Conboy may have a size-based release from predation by bullfrogs. Implicit in this finding is that bullfrogs may pose a real threat via predation to other Oregon Spotted Frog populations with which they might come into contact where the distribution of bullfrog body sizes differ substantially from that at Conboy Lake...|$|R
5|$|Operation Winter '94 {{pushed back}} {{the front line}} of the VRS by about , {{capturing}} much of the Livanjsko field. The attack failed to achieve its primary objective but it brought the Croatian forces within <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> of the Drvar–Knin road. Operation Winter '94 was followed by Operation Leap1 (Operacija Skok1) on 7 April 1995, which improved HV positions on Mount Dinara on the southern rim of the field, dominating the area around the RSK capital. The Croatian forces renewed their advance with Operation Leap2 between 4 and 10 June, allowing them to directly threaten Bosansko Grahovo on the Drvar–Knin road, and to secure the remainder of the valley. The improved Croatian dispositions around Livanjsko field provided a springboard for further offensive action on this front during Operation Summer'95.|$|E

Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Native families. Because not all of the captives were present, the Native Americans were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio Native Americans agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.|$|E
5|$|Multiple rocket launcher: The first {{multiple}} rocket launchers {{were made}} during the medieval Chinese Song dynasty. It was designed to launch multiple rocket arrows from a gunpowder box. These also appeared later, in an expanded version, in the Joseon Dynasty of Korea, where they were used with great effectiveness against the Japanese invasions of 1592–98, most notably the Battle of Haengju. Multiple rocket launchers evolved from Chinese fire lances when the Song military favored multiple rocket launchers that fired simultaneously up to 100 small fire-arrow rockets after the Mongol siege of Kaifeng. The typical powder section of such an arrow-rocket was 1/3 and 1/2 ft (10 to 15 cm) long.
