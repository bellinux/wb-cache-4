40|$|Even though <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> {{are often}} {{observed}} in meandering rivers, {{it is still}} not evident what exactly causes their formation. According to several studies on natural rivers, <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> only form when there are discharge variations and therefore pulses of outer bank erosion. Otherwise a flat point bar would develop as a continuous process. However, numerous flume experiments have reported on <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> formation while discharge is constant. Also, there are observations in natural rivers that sedimentation on the inner bank causes outer bank erosion. The objective of this research is to determine if erosion of the outer bank or variation in sediment supply is the leading process for the development of <b>scroll</b> <b>bars.</b> In order to study the development of <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> while controlling the boundary conditions, an experimental meandering river was created in a 3 x 11 m flume. Eight cases were performed in developed bends, which included the addition of sediment pulses and removal of part of the outer bend. Sediment pulses were added in order to determine if variations in sediment supply from upstream causes individual <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> to form and whether inner bend accretion is the dominant process in bend migration. This was done in an already migrating bend and in a bend that did not migrate before the perturbation. Part of the outer bend was removed several times in order to determine if outer bend erosion is the dominant process leading to <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> formation and bend migration. This corresponds to discontinuous outer bank erosion in nature. Also, in one bend the outer bank was fixated, in order to see if <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> would still develop if there is no erosion of the outer bend. In nature this corresponds to a meander bend with a high bank strength. In all cases the accretion of the inner bend and the erosion of the outer bend were monitored and flow velocities were measured. <b>Scroll</b> <b>bars</b> were observed in all bends that migrated and were formed by multiple bedforms that were deposited by secondary currents. Channel width increased downstream of the apex of these bends, causing flow velocities to decrease. Therefore, <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> were formed at the downstream end of a bend. Forced sediment pulses did not cause individual <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> to develop and had no significant effect on flow velocities and outer bend erosion. In the bend that was fixated, eventually no sediment was deposited on the point bar anymore and therefore also no <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> formed. However, each removal of part of the outer bend caused flow velocities to decrease at the inner bend due to the increase in width, which caused a <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> to develop. Erosion of the outer bend is thus the leading process in <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> formation and channel width variations are essential to explain sediment deposition and meander bend migration. Further research can be done on <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> in relatively sharp bends where flow separation zones are present. Also, in several natural rivers relatively wide <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> are observed, which differ with the <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> in the experiment...|$|R

40|$|Some {{documents}} provoke {{emotions in}} people viewing them. Will {{it be possible}} to describe emotions consistently and use this information in retrieval systems? We tested collective (statistically aggregated) emotion indexing using images as examples. Considering psychological results, basic emotions are anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness. This study follows an approach developed by Lee and Neal (2007) for music emotion retrieval and applies <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> for tagging basic emotions and their intensities. A sample comprising 763 persons tagged emotions caused by images (retrieved from www. Flickr. com) applying <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> and (linguistic) tags.

40|$|Rivers are {{essential}} {{components of the}} earth surface. The worldâ€™s largest rivers have been studied much less than to smaller rivers. They are dominated by meandering channels â€“ whether these are individual km-wide meander bends or â€˜accessoryâ€™ meandering channels in an anabranching system. Large rivers, specifically ones with laterally migrating bends, can build a variety of floodplain elements that are represented by a complex surface topography, the dynamics and characteristics of which are not yet fully understood. This research brings a greater understanding to, and quantification of, the floodplain topography and geomorphology of large rivers. The project uses remote sensing imagery of the Worldâ€™s largest rivers, LiDAR datasets of meandering <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> topography, and global coverage elevation data. Novel analytical methods are created, involving image manipulation and GIS processing, to quantify these landforms {{in a way that}} was not possible until recent technological and computational advancements. A new hierarchical classification schema of meandering floodplain deposits is presented and applied to quantify meandering deposits for two large rivers, the Amazon and the Ob. Both floodplains show similar downstream morphological changes to their floodplains despite their different sizes and locations. The new classification schema works well to describe meandering floodplain deposits. The geomorphology of <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> is investigated for the Mississippi River, revealing the heterogeneity of these deposits and that local meander bend conditions are important in determining <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> formation and preservation on the floodplain. The periodicity of <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> from a range of rivers is investigated and it is shown that <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> are intrinsically linked with the width of the adjacent river channel and respond to local planform changes. Floodplains of large rivers have complex overbank sedimentation processes that create spillage sedimentation phenomena. Spillage sedimentation was quantified down a 1700 km reach of the Amazon River and a 1400 km reach for the River Ob, revealing spatial discontinuities in spillage phenomena. Spillage dominance depends on diverse sediment loadings, hydrological sequencing, and morphological opportunity. Understanding spillage dynamics is important in quantifying overbank sedimentation rates and the spatial distribution of fine-grained deposits. The findings of this thesis highlight that despite the incredible complexity and heterogeneity of large river floodplains, order can be inferred via classification schemas and fundamental relationships identified. The thesis uses novel methods and conceptual models to bring a greater understanding and quantification to this complex floodplain geomorphology...|$|R
