50|$|A study {{conducted}} on <b>suicide</b> <b>notes,</b> examined the frequency in themes of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness in samples of <b>suicide</b> <b>notes.</b> The study of <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> {{has been a}} useful method for examining the motivations of suicides. It {{is important to note}} that this research is limited due to the small proportion of completed suicides that actually leave notes. This specific study explored the extent to which the content in the <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> reflected thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. They also examined the extent to which these two themes were found in the same note. What this study found was that interpersonal theory of suicide which proposes suicidal behavior is caused by perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness combined with acquired capability, was not significantly reflective in the <b>suicide</b> <b>notes.</b> Therefore, there was no strong support for the relevance of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness as motivations of suicide. They did however, find that the <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> of women more frequently contained the theme of perceived burdensomeness and <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> of younger people more frequently contained thwarted belongingness.|$|R
40|$|Police {{investigation}} {{records of}} all suicide cases in 1992 (n= 769) and the <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> {{that had been}} left (224 notes for 154 subjects) were examined. Note-leavers were characterized as young females, of non-widowed marital status, with no history of previous suicide attempts, no previous psychiatric illness, and with religious beliefs. <b>Suicide</b> <b>notes</b> written by young people were longer, rich in emotions, and often begging for forgiveness. <b>Suicide</b> <b>notes</b> written by the elderly were shorter, contained specific instructions, and were less emotional. A significant proportion of note-leavers did mention their difficulties. <b>Suicide</b> <b>notes</b> may serve some explanatory purpose and may have a therapeutic role in helping the surviving relatives to understand the suicide.

40|$|Lexical Means in Communicating Emotion in <b>Suicide</b> <b>Notes</b> - on the Basis of the Polish Corpus of <b>Suicide</b> <b>Notes</b> Polish Corpus of <b>Suicide</b> <b>Notes</b> (PCSN) is a {{relatively}} large set of authentic <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> that are linguistically annotated on several levels. In order to identify features characteristic for this genre we compared PCSN with the collected subcorpus of counterfeited <b>suicide</b> <b>notes.</b> In this paper {{we focus on the}} lexical means of expressing emotions. Our goal was to analyse ways of expressing emotions in this specific genre. Our initial list of lexical markers was based on Markowski’s list of the lexis common for different genres. The list was next expanded {{with the help of the}} plWordNet 2. 0 — a lexico-semantic network. The expansion was based on the manually selected noun and verb hypernymy branches according to their correspondence to the elements of the initial list. For words from the extended list, a quantitative analysis was performed for both authentic and fake <b>suicide</b> <b>notes.</b> We have also analysed the use of the lexical markers of emotions, feelings and emotional states, as well as emotion operators, and ways of expressing personal evaluation, affection and hate...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Studying <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> is {{a strong}} {{methodology}} in suicidology {{and one of the}} most relevant theoretical frameworks is the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide proposed by Joiner. This study analyzed 80 <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> collected in Chile searching for the risk factors proposed by the theory and its implications. The clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of the notes' authors were analyzed too. Methods: The <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> were classified according to the presence or absence of the suicide risk factors proposed by the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and were analyzed linguistically with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program. Results: One or both interpersonal risk factors indicated by the theory were identified in 60 % of the notes. The “lack of belonging” factor was the most common risk factor, and various linguistic profiles in the <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> were found according to the presence or absence of this factor. Conclusions: We confirmed the relevance of the interpersonal risk factors proposed as issues present in a high percentage of notes and found linguistic differences according to its presence or absence in the <b>suicide</b> <b>notes...</b>|$|R

5|$|Assigned male at birth, she {{was given}} the name Joshua Alcorn and raised in Ohio by a family {{affiliated}} with the Churches of Christ movement. At age 14, she came out as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo transition treatment, instead sending her to Christian-based conversion therapy {{with the intention of}} convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media. In her <b>suicide</b> <b>note,</b> Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings. She committed suicide by walking out in front of oncoming traffic on the Interstate 71 highway.|$|E
5|$|His lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl, felt Hess {{was too old}} {{and frail}} to have managed to kill himself. Wolf Rüdiger Hess {{repeatedly}} claimed {{that his father had}} been murdered by the British Secret Intelligence Service to prevent him from revealing information about British misconduct during the war. Abdallah Melaouhi, who served as Hess's medical orderly from 1982 to 1987, was dismissed from his position at his local district parliament's Immigration and Integration Advisory Council after he wrote a self-published book on a similar theme. According to an investigation by the British government in 1989, the available evidence did not back up the claim that Hess was murdered, and Solicitor General Sir Nicholas Lyell saw no grounds for further investigation. Moreover, the autopsy results support the conclusion that Hess had killed himself. A report released in 2012 again raised the question of whether Hess was murdered. Historian Peter Padfield claims the <b>suicide</b> <b>note</b> found on the body appears to have been written when Hess was hospitalised in 1969.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first act, the judge asks the court clerk to call jurors from the audience. Once the jurors are seated, the prosecution argument begins. Flint explains that Andre was not just Faulkner's secretary, but also his lover. He says Faulkner jilted her to marry Nancy Lee Whitfield and fired Andre, motivating Andre to murder him. Flint then calls a series of witnesses, starting with the medical examiner, who testifies that Faulkner's body was so damaged by the fall {{that it was impossible to}} determine whether he was killed by the impact or was already dead. An elderly night watchman and a private investigator describe the events they saw that evening. A police inspector testifies to finding a <b>suicide</b> <b>note.</b> Faulkner's very religious housekeeper disapprovingly describes the sexual relationship between Andre and Faulkner, and says she saw Andre with another man after Faulkner's marriage. Nancy Lee testifies about her and Faulkner's courtship and marriage, portraying both as idyllic. The act ends with Andre speaking out of turn to accuse Nancy Lee of lying.|$|E

5|$|In Gotham City, {{some time}} after {{defeating}} the Penguin, the crime fighter Batman defuses a hostage situation caused by a criminal known as Two-Face, the alter ego of the former district attorney Harvey Dent, but Two-Face escapes and remains at large. Edward Nygma, a researcher at Wayne Enterprises who idolizes Bruce Wayne, has developed a device that can beam television into a person's brain. Bruce offers to let Nygma come up with schematics for the device {{and set up a}} meeting with his assistant. However, after Nygma demands an answer from him immediately, Bruce rejects the invention, believing it to be too close to mind manipulation. After killing his supervisor Fred Stickley, Nygma resigns and seeks retaliation against Bruce for rejecting his invention and begins to send him riddles (Nygma rigs the security cameras to record Stickley committing suicide, as well as a <b>suicide</b> <b>note,</b> which everybody believes but Bruce Wayne doubts this is the truth) A news report reveals how Harvey Dent became Two-Face: when he was prosecuting a mob boss named Sal Maroni, Maroni threw acid on Dent's face, disfiguring half of it. Batman tried to save him, but failed. After the incident, Dent seeks to kill Batman for failing to save him. Bruce meets Chase Meridian, a psychiatrist who is obsessed with Batman, and invites her to come with him to a circus event. After a performance from the circus performers, The Flying Graysons, Two-Face arrives and threatens to blow up the circus unless Batman comes forward and surrenders his life to him. The Flying Graysons attempt to stop Two-Face, but most of them get killed as a result. Only Dick Grayson, the youngest member, survives as he climbs to the roof and throws Two-Face's bomb into a river.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} study of a corpus of 286 <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> {{collected}} from the Birmingham Coroner’s Office, with additional findings from 33 real and 33 fabricated notes from Los Angeles. Following some background regarding how <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> are treated by Coroners’ Courts and other courts in the U. K, the thesis compares topics used in real and fabricated <b>suicide</b> <b>notes.</b> Although there is considerable overlap between the two categories, they can be partially distinguished by some features that {{are more likely to}} occur in one category than the other. For example, dates, indications of author identity and trivia are more likely to occur in real notes than fabricated ones. The thesis then concentrates on fake notes and scrutinises instances of atypical language or phraseology and contextually inappropriate content. It is found that these oddities are far more frequent in the fake notes than in the genuine ones. Finally the thesis focuses on the corpus of genuine notes from the Birmingham Coroner’s Office, using an automatic semantic tagger. The findings are that <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> contain significant proportions of items indicating affection, the future and their authors’ kin. In addition, the notes include significant proportions of pronouns, names, negatives, intensifiers, maximum quantity terms, and discourse markers.

40|$|Popular culture {{insists on}} the {{significance}} of <b>suicide</b> <b>notes,</b> but research has yielded conflicting results about who leaves notes. Utilizing 6 years of sui-cides from a comprehensive statewide data surveillance system, differences were examined between cases with <b>suicide</b> <b>notes</b> and those without in terms of demo-graphics, circumstances of the suicide, and precipitating circumstances. Of the 2, 936 suicides, 18. 25 % included a note. Demographics and circumstances did not differ for cases with a note compared to cases with no note. Results have implications for working with people bereaved by suicide in helping understand that the notes are uncommon and not systematic.

The <b>suicide</b> <b>notes,</b> I suggest, can be read as offering us a critique of the anxious times in which we find ourselves.
