5|$|Mired in this {{theoretical}} crisis, the Modern Benoni remained unpopular in the 1990s. Veselin Topalov was {{the only}} top-level player to play it regularly, and he too generally preferred the 2...e6 3.Nf3 c5 move order. At {{the beginning of the}} new millennium, the theoretician John Watson published a well-regarded survey of the opening that {{may have contributed to the}} opening's revival. Many of the ideas he recommended, such as 9...Qh4+ versus the Taimanov Attack and 9...Nh5 in the Modern Main Line, grew in popularity after its publication. The opening regained <b>some</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> its former respectability when Vladimir Kramnik, needing a win with Black against Peter Leko, played it in the second to last game of the 2004 World Championship. While he did achieve a winning position at one point, the game ended in a draw. Nevertheless, Étienne Bacrot, Boris Gelfand and Vassily Ivanchuk have all since used the Modern Benoni at the highest levels of competition, while Vugar Gashimov became the opening's most notable proponent. He was the strongest player willing to use the original 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 move order and defend Black's cause in both the Taimanov Attack and the Modern Main Line.|$|E

The devastation continued on 1724–1725 by a crucial {{invasion of the}} city by Ottoman army.

500|$|In April 2012, in Geneseo, New York, Cudi {{performed}} {{before a}} sold out crowd and premiered a hip hop song, his first since 2010. During his set, he performed a new record, tentatively titled [...] "The Leader of the Delinquents", {{which he did}} a cappella. On April 25, 2012 Cudi was officially back to rapping {{with the release of}} [...] "Dennis, Hook Me Up with <b>Some</b> <b>More</b> <b>of</b> That Whiskey!".

On July 10, 2012 via his Twitter feed, Cudi announced collaborations on the album thus far, as the album had not yet been completed, to be Pusha T, Jaden Smith and Kendrick Lamar, along with more familiar collaborators Kanye West, King Chip and Cage. He also revealed he was hoping to collaborate with 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Diplo and MGMT. In September, he had also expressed interest in working with Harlem-bred rapper ASAP Rocky on Indicud.

500|$|Andrade {{was born}} on November 3, 1989 in Gómez Palacio, Durango, Mexico, the son of Jose Andrade Salas, who is {{better known as the}} wrestler Brillante. He became part of the third {{generation}} of the Andrade family to compete in lucha libre. His grandfather, Jose Andrade, wrestled under the ring name [...] "El Moro", his father works as Brillante, his uncles wrestle or wrestled under the names Diamante/Moro III (Sergio Andrade), Zafiro/Pentagoncito (real name unrevealed), Kevin (Juan Andrade), Espanto Jr./Pentagón (Jesus Andrade), Espiritu Magico (Juan Andrade) and one of his cousins works as the current Espanto Jr. (real name unrevealed) Due to the secretive nature of lucha libre, where they often do not reveal the real names of masked wrestlers, it is possible that <b>some</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Andrade's siblings or cousins are also professional wrestlers. With his father, uncles and grandfather being involved in running a local lucha libre promotion and school in Durango Andrade began training for a professional career from an early age, initially by playing around with his father and uncles, but later began to train seriously for a career in the wrestling ring. He made his professional wrestling debut on October 3, 2003, a month before his 14th birthday, but only after his father signing a waiver for the local boxing and wrestling commission to issue him a license. He began working under the ring name Brillante Jr. in honor of his father.|$|E

According to Lombardo, they also recorded some songs for a potential future release: [...] "We recorded some of my songs in 2006 at The Blasting Room. In 2002 we recorded {{a whole bunch of}} songs, mostly Frank's songs. He was a great songwriter. He had such a unique EQ out of his amp. When we recorded later in 2008, we did <b>some</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> my songs, but Frank wasn't there for that. We tried to recreate that unique Frank sound. I'd like to think of these as songs that if the Descendents had stayed together, this is what we would have sounded like. Those are in Bill's hands.

[...] According to Dennis Dewsnap's memoir, What's Sex Got To Do With It (The Syden Press, 2004), Orton and Halliwell had their ashes mixed and were buried together. Dewsnap writes about Orton's agent Peggy Ramsay: [...] "...At the scattering of Joe's and Kenneth's ashes, his sister took a handful from both urns and said, 'A little bit of Joe, {{and a little bit}} of Kenneth.

2500|$|In {{the summer}} Darwin paid visits to Squire Owen, and romance {{seemed to be}} blossoming with the squire's {{daughter}} Fanny. Darwin joined other Cambridge friends on a three-month [...] "reading party" [...] at Barmouth {{on the coast of}} Wales to revise their studies with private tutors. For Charles it was an [...] "Entomo-Mathematical expedition". Though he badly needed to catch up with his mathematics, the insect collecting predominated along with pleasant diversions such as hillwalking, boating and fly fishing. He went on daily walks with his close friend, the older student John Maurice Herbert who he dubbed [...] "Cherbury" [...] after Herbert of Cherbury, the father of English Deism. Herbert assisted with the insect collecting, but the usual outcome was that Darwin would examine Herbert's collecting bottle and say [...] "Well, old Cherbury, none of these will do." [...] In September Darwin wrote to tell [...] "My dear old Cherbury" [...] that his own catches had included [...] "some of the rarest of the British Insects, & their being found near Barmouth is quite unknown to the Entomological world: I think I shall write & inform some of the crack Entomologists." [...] He described these [...] "extremely rare" [...] insects and asked Herbert to oblige him by collecting <b>some</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> them.|$|E

2500|$|A {{disagreement}} led to Vangelis withholding {{permission for}} his {{performance of the}} music from Blade Runner to be released, and the studio instead hired a group of musicians dubbed [...] "The New American Orchestra" [...] to record the official LP released at the time. It took 12 years before the disagreement was resolved and Vangelis's own work was released in the United States, in 1994. The soundtrack was still incomplete, as the film contained some non-Vangelis tracks as well. Over the years a number of bootleg recordings of the Blade Runner soundtrack from unknown sources have been released, mostly targeted to collectors as [...] "private releases", that contain most of the music cues (including the Ladd Company logo theme). An official three-disc box set was released in late 2007 to commemorate the film's 25th anniversary: it contained the original 1994 album, a second disc containing <b>some</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the missing music cues and a third disc of new Vangelis material inspired by Blade Runner. The 2007 release still lacks some incidental music, most notably the background music from the Taffey Lewis bar scene featuring vocals by Demis Roussos. A 35th anniversary LP of the original soundtrack was released on Record Store Day 2017.|$|E
2500|$|At {{an unknown}} date Rodrigo—in his own words, [...] "seized by diabolical rage"—burned down {{the church of}} Santa María de Mal. On 20 February 1171, in penance for this sin, he donated the church San Salvador de Sarria to the Cathedral of Lugo. Later that year, perhaps out of guilt, he {{resigned}} his tenencias and joined the Order of Santiago. Two documents of September 1172/3 place Rodrigo, as a knight of the Order, at the court of Afonso I of Portugal in Coimbra. By 1172 Rodrigo had grown dissatisfied with the lax practices of the Order of Santiago, especially the allowance for members to marry, and he received permission from the Papal legate Jacinth to Spain to found a new confraternity {{in accordance with the}} [...] Cistercian rule (instituta Cisterciensis ordinis). This was approved by Pope Alexander III the next year. Alexander forbade the new order to accept any former members of Santiago or to acquire any properties that might be disputed by Santiago. The use of the Cistercian rule caused some controversy at the Abbey of Cîteaux, where the chapter objected to Rodrigo's [...] "inconstancy", but the abbot eventually approved it without the consent of the chapter, which was obtained later (by December 1175). Late in 1173 or early in 1174 Rodrigo and a few companions founded the Order of Mountjoy. Shortly afterwards his wife separated from him and later joined her mother's convent at Carrizo (founded 1176), where she would be abbess between 1184 and 1191. On 28 November 1190 she gave <b>some</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> her bridewealth to San Marcos de León and the Order of Santiago. She probably died in 1192.|$|E
2500|$|Halfway to Sanity {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. When {{it was released}} in September 1987, the New York Post praised it to be another well pieced album by the Ramones, and Billboard exclaimed that Sire should have released [...] "Go Lil' Camaro Go" [...] as a single. However, in the United Kingdom, the album received virtually no attention from professional critics. Ramones Fanzine writer Mark Bannister explained {{that the reason for}} the silent press in the United Kingdom was that the album [...] "didn't sound right without <b>some</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Joey's songs to balance out Dee Dee's. There was no equilibrium." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album one and a half out of five stars, saying that although it remains similar to Animal Boy in that it features the use of heavy guitars, but asserted that it is [...] "much sharper record" [...] only because it did not overlook the band's [...] "trashy pop roots." [...] He pointed out that their musical style was inconsistent, going on to say that the band could have went about their second decade of music making [...] "more gracefully" [...] but concluded by saying that although it was not as [...] "strong" [...] as 1983's Subterranean Jungle or 1984's Too Tough to Die, it was the last release where the band actually [...] "sounded like they mattered." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "C+" [...] and wrote a shorter review, where he states: [...] "It kills me to say this, but with Richie or whoever on the lam, Dee Dee moonlighting as a punk-rapper, Joey frequenting all-acoustic showcases, and Johnny Johnny, a great band has finally worn down into a day job for night people." ...|$|E
