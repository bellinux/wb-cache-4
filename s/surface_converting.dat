A photo-excited hot electron in the STM tip resonantly tunnels into an excited state of a single molecule on the <b>surface,</b> <b>converting</b> it from the neutral to the anion. The electron transfer rate depends quadratically on the incident laser power, suggesting a two-photon excitation process. This nonlinear optical process is further confirmed by the polarization measurement. Spatial dependence of the electron transfer rate exhibits atomic-scale variations.

We find that significant background signals, originating from scattering off the probe tip, can be observed even after modulation. These background signals result from path-length difference modulation, and thus depend on phase-sensitive detection. We use a dipole antenna model to explain the spatial variation of this signal.

The bilayer, formed by grafting of cetyl trimethylammonium (CTA) ions {{to the internal}} surface of {CdPS_ 3 }, functionlizes the <b>surface,</b> <b>converting</b> it from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic surface.

The presence of the guest phenol, which is rotationally mobile, induces conformational disorder in the methylene chains of the intercalated bilayer. The nature and extent of conformational disorder have been studied using infrared and Raman vibrational spectroscopy and {^{ 13 }C CP-MAS NMR} spectroscopy.

40|$|Maize (Zea mays) {{endosperm}} {{consists of}} an epidermal-like surface layer of aleurone cells, an underlying body of starchy endosperm cells, and a basal layer of transfer cells. To determine whether surrounding maternal tissues perform a role in specifying endosperm cell fates, a maize endosperm organ culture technique was established whereby the developing endosperm is completely removed from surrounding maternal tissues. Using cell type-specific fluorescence markers, we show that aleurone cell fate specification occurs exclusively in response to surface position and does not require specific, continued maternal signal input. The starchy endosperm and aleurone cell fates are freely interchangeable throughout the lifespan of the endosperm, with internalized aleurone cells converting to starchy endosperm cells and with starchy endosperm cells that become positioned at the <b>surface</b> <b>converting</b> to aleurone cells. In contrast to aleurone and starchy endosperm cells, transfer cells fail to develop in in vitro-grown endosperm, supporting earlier indications that maternal tissue interaction is required to fully differentiate this cell type.

The “inclined Lidar” technique could be useful for this purpose. It works {{based on the fact}} that a near-infrared Lidar mounted with a large incidence angle can detect suspended particles slightly below the surface, provided that the water is very turbid, something which is likely during flash floods. To check this hypothesis, an inexpensive “time of flight” (TOF) Lidar was installed during a rainy season at the Amacuzac River (Mexico), which was usually found to be extremely turbid (Secchi depth < 0. 5 m). Under these circumstances, the Lidar had no difficulty detecting the water (sub) <b>surface.</b> <b>Converting</b> the measured distances into stage estimates through a simple (one point) calibration resulted in reasonable agreement with reference data (within ± 0. 08 m (p = 0. 95) and always < 0. 5 m), especially during the passing of a flash flood.

However, this bacterium is known to vary the amount of CPS expressed on the cell <b>surface,</b> <b>converting</b> from an opaque (Op) colony phenotype to a translucent (Tr) colony phenotype. In this study, the consistency of CPS conversion was determined for four strains of V. vulnificus. Environmental conditions including variations in aeration, temperature, incubation time, oxidative stress, and media (heart infusion or modified maintenance medium agar) were investigated to determine their influence on CPS conversion. All conditions, with the exception of variations in media and oxidative stress, significantly affected the conversion of the population, with high ranges of CPS expression found even within cells from a single colony. The global quorum-sensing regulators RpoS and AI- 2 were also examined. While RpoS was found to significantly mediate phenotypic conversion, quorum sensing was not. Finally, 12 strains that comprise the recently found clinical (C) and environmental (E) genotypes of V. vulnificus were examined to determine their rates of population conversion. C-genotype strains, which are most often associated with infection, had a significantly lower rate of population conversion from Op to Tr phenotypes than did E-genotype strains (ca. 38 % versus ca. 14 %, respectively).

A routine monitoring program at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center has recorded over 300 impact flashes since early 2006. The program utilizes multiple 0. 35 m (14 inch) Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes, outfitted with video cameras using the 1 / 2 inch Sony EXview HAD CCDTM chip, to perform simultaneous observations of the earthshine hemisphere of the Moon when the lunar phase is between 0. 1 and 0. 5. This optical arrangement permits monitoring of approximately 3. 8 x 10 (6) km 2 of lunar surface. A selection of 126 flashes recorded in 266. 88 hours of photometric skies was analyzed, creating the largest and most homogeneous dataset of lunar impact flashes to date. Standard CCD photometric techniques outlined in [1] were applied to the video to determine the luminous energy, kinetic energy, and mass for each impactor, considering a range of luminous efficiencies.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{magnetic}} structure of the high symmetry vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO) _(2) P_(2) O) 7, VOPO), focusing on the spin exchange couplings, using density functional theory (B 3 LYP) with the full three-dimensional periodicity. VOPO involves four distinct spin couplings: two larger couplings exist along the chain direction (a-axis), which we predict to be antiferromagnetic, J_(OPO) = − 156. 8 K and J_O = − 68. 6 K, and two weaker couplings appear along the c (between two layers) and b directions (between two chains in the same layer), which we calculate to be ferromagnetic, J_layer = 19. 2 K and J_chain = 2. 8 K. Based on the local density of states and the response of spin couplings to varying the cell parameter a, we found that J_(OPO) originates from a super-exchange interaction through the bridging –O–P–O– unit. In contrast, J_O results from a direct overlap of 3 d_(x^ 2 − y^ 2) orbitals on two vanadium atoms in the same V_(2) O_ 8 motif, making it very sensitive to structural fluctuations. Based on the variations in V–O bond length {{as a function of}} strain along a, we found that the V–O bonds of V–(OPO) _(2) –V are covalent and rigid, whereas the bonds of V–(O) _(2) –V are fragile and dative. These distinctions suggest that compression along the a-axis would have a dramatic impact on J_O, changing the magnetic structure and spin gap of VOPO. This result also suggests that assuming J_O to be a constant over the range of 2 – 300 K whilst fitting couplings to the experimental magnetic susceptibility is an invalid method. Regarding its role as a catalyst, the bonding pattern suggests that O_ 2 can penetrate beyond the top layers of the VOPO <b>surface,</b> <b>converting</b> multiple V atoms from the + 4 to + 5 oxidation state, which seems crucial to explain the deep oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride...|$|E

40|$|Ellipsometry {{techniques}} look at {{changes in}} polarization states to measure optical properties of thin film materials. A beam reflected from a substrate measures {{the real and}} imaginary parts of the index of the material represented as n and k, respectively. Measuring the substrate at several angles gives additional {{information that can be}} used to measure multilayer thin film stacks. However, the outstanding problem in standard ellipsometry is that it uses a limited number of incident polarization states (s and p). This limits the technique to isotropic materials. The technique discussed in this paper extends the standard process to measure anisotropic materials by using a larger set of incident polarization states. By using a polarimeter to generate several incident polarization states and measure the polarization properties of the sample, ellipsometry can be performed on biaxial materials. Use of an optimization algorithm in conjunction with biaxial ellipsometry can more accurately determine the dielectric tensor of individual layers in multilayer structures. Biaxial ellipsometry is a technique that measures the dielectric tensors of a biaxial substrate, single-layer thin film, or multi-layer structure. The dielectric tensor of a biaxial material consists of the real and imaginary parts of the three orthogonal principal indices (nₓ + ikₓ, n(y) +ik(y) and n(z) + ik(z)) as well as three Euler angles (α, β, and γ) to describe its orientation. The method utilized in this work measures an angle-of-incidence Mueller matrix from a Mueller matrix imaging polarimeter equipped with a pair of microscope objectives that have low polarization properties. To accurately determine the dielectric tensors for multilayer samples, the angle-of-incidence Mueller matrix images are collected for multiple wavelengths. This is done in either a transmission mode or a reflection mode, each incorporates an appropriate dispersion model. Given approximate a priori knowledge of the dielectric tensor and film thickness, a Jones reflectivity matrix is calculated by solving Maxwell's equations at each <b>surface.</b> <b>Converting</b> the Jones matrix into a Mueller matrix provides a starting point for optimization. An optimization algorithm then finds the best fit dielectric tensor based on the measured angle-of-incidence Mueller matrix image. This process can be applied to polarizing materials, birefringent crystals and the multilayer structures of liquid crystal displays. In particular, the need for such accuracy in liquid crystal displays is growing as their applications in industry evolve...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{molecular}} dynamic (MD) simulations {{were employed}} on different model systems of practical and theoretical significance to investigate possible mechanisms of kinetic hydrate inhibition. Water/methane interface structuring and possible precursors to hydrate nucleation {{have been investigated}} using a model system of water and methane at different densities. The impact of oligomers, specifically Poly-N-VinylCaprolactam (PVCap) dodecamer, on structuring of water/methane interfaces at different methane densities was investigated utilizing two different sets of partial atomic charges. In yet another system, the effect of high PVCap concentration on water restructuring was also analyzed. Regions of stability for methane hydrate have been investigated using a model system consisting of a slab of hydrate embedded in liquid water. Solvation Model 6 was applied to obtain charges on PVCap atoms using density functional theory with B 3 LYP and STO- 6 - 31 +G** basis set. MM 3 force field parameters were used to handle torsional and angle-bending motions. Intermolecular interactions were treated {{by a combination of}} Coulomb and Lennard-Jones potentials. Temperature was first controlled by a simple velocity scaling and then {{towards the end of the}} simulation run, Nosé-Hoover thermostat was used. Systems containing liquid water and methane showed certain signs of hydrate nucleation. The dissolution of methane into water appeared to increase with methane concentration. PVCap formed hydrogen bonds with water via carbonyl oxygen and hence hindered water reordering needed to build hydrate cages from liquid water. The PVCap behavior was shown to be heavily affected by its concentration in water and distribution of atomic charges. At low concentrations, PVCap preferred the water-methane interface and did not interact with each other, similar to another kinetic inhibitor, PVP (Kvamme et al. 2005). When the liquid PVCap content was high, it evidently modified the interfacial tension of water-methane <b>surface,</b> <b>converting</b> the initially dispersed methane phase into separated bubbles. The PVCap molecules then built a system-wide network that covered the interface between water and methane bubbles. The orientations and interactions of PVCap molecule with other molecules was influenced by the distribution of the partial atomic charges. Charges obtained via Charge Model 4 proved to result in a more reliable behavior than those obtained by means of the Löwdin population analysis. Several of the hydrate-containing systems showed a tendency to melt when in contact with liquid water even at temperatures (200 K, 240 K) well below the hydrate stability region. This behavior was attributed to the fact that hydrate volume available in a MD experiment is small and lacks the stabilizing presence of bulk.
