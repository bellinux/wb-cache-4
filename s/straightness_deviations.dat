Then it focuses on issues associated with the prediction of deflections of a rib wall during machining. Later on it focuses on different methods and strategies of thin-walled part milling. The diploma thesis also describes an experiment of manufacturing thin-walled components {{in the form of}} ribs and evaluation parameters such as roughness, perpendicularity and <b>straightness</b> <b>deviations,</b> width of the rib and force loading of a cutting tool as measured by various gages. The final part is devoted to a calculation of the specific cutting force and its comparison with its theoretical value...|$|E
40|$|Deep hole {{drilling}} {{methods such as}} BTA-deep {{hole drilling}} are machining processes to produce boreholes with high length to diameter ratio as well as boreholes with high quality. Nevertheless, if prism-shaped workpieces or workpieces with eccentrically placed boreholes have to be machined the product attribute hole <b>straightness</b> <b>deviation</b> {{can lead to a}} main problem. The non-compliance of the tolerances of hole <b>straightness</b> <b>deviation</b> can cause a rectification of rejects or the loss of functionality of the workpiece. These kinds of workpieces can only be produced by an exclusive tool rotation with a non rotating workpiece. Within this paper a new method, developed at the Institute of Machining Technology, is described to reduce the hole <b>straightness</b> <b>deviation.</b> This method bases on a thermally influencing, in particular on induction heating at the workpiece. Furthermore, the essentially variables for an effective influencing of the orientation of the tool are analysed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStraightness {{control in}} deep hole {{gundrilling}} of Inconel- 718 is challenging. In this study, the drills {{are found to}} degrade rapidly on the cutting edges, bearing pads and side margins, {{largely due to the}} extreme heat resistivity of the high temperature superalloys. Severe adhesive wear developed on the rake and flank faces deteriorates cutting efficiencies of the cutting edges while diffusive wear on the bearing pads and side margins deteriorates self-piloting efficacies of the drill. Coupled with highly irregular wear rates on the inner and outer cutting edges, the drills are forced against the hole at high rotational speeds – leading to escalations in frictional contact, heating and thermal damage on the bearing pads and side margins. As a consequence, the drills are deflected from the designated drilling course and resulted in <b>straightness</b> <b>deviation</b> on the part of hole drilled. Through the accumulation of partial <b>straightness</b> <b>deviation</b> over the course of high aspect ratio drilling, the final hole produced is deflected in a constant trend as governed by the rate and behaviour of tool degradation...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{contactless}} optical sensor {{based on the}} laser-self-mixing effect for real-time measurement of linear and transverse displacements of a moving stage. The sensor is able to measure linear displacements of up to 400 mm along the main optical axis while simultaneously estimating <b>straightness</b> and flatness <b>deviations</b> up to 1 mm. The sensor exploits two identical coplanar nonparallel self-mixing interferometers and requires only one reference plane. The {{reduction in the number}} of optical elements allowed by the self-mixing configuration and the intrinsic stiffness of the adopted geometry result in a compact, low-cost, and easy-to-align setup...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} of the {{contractual}} research was to establish an optical lab for the measuring of barrel rifling straightness and to perform laboratory measurement of samples of ballistic barrels as well as analyse the measurement data. The used method {{is based on the}} laser measuring of <b>straightness</b> where side <b>deviations</b> of a beam are detected. These deviations are caused by deviations of the position of the retroreflector while it is shifted down the measured barrel. This retroreflector copies deviations of a barrel from straightness. The measured data were analysed with the help of our measuring software. The realization of the optical lab continues the previous performed study...|$|R
40|$|The study {{deals with}} X-ray CT {{technology}} {{to inspect the}} inside parts of workpiece without destroying them. At present, there is few softwares capable of processing X-ray CT scanned data. Therefore, the function was developed to treat the data to evaluate geometric elements such as straight lines, circular arc and others, based on 3 -dimensional CAD data as the standard of inspection. After the coordinate system of scanned data is automatically related with the 3 -dimensional CAD data, the system evaluates geometric elements considering that a workpiece contour consists of a cluster of segments. Thus, the system cuts the contour of 3 -dimensional CAD data on the appointed cross-sectional planes and classifies them into geometric elements. To compare 3 -dimensional CAD data with the X-ray CT scanned data, the system calculates the <b>straightness,</b> angle <b>deviation</b> from the direction vector, length and its error of a straight line, and, roundness, deviation of center point, radius and its elTor. In addition, the system offers a visualization interface to display them so that the users utilize the evaluated result comfortably. As a result, the system is found effective to evaluate 2 -dimensional geometric elements...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{a study of}} the {{influence}} of cutting speed and feed on different geometric <b>deviations</b> (<b>straightness,</b> parallelism, roundness, and circular run-out) of dry turned UNS A 97075 (Al-Zn) cylindrical bars has been carried out. The experimental data have revealed a low sensitivity to change of these deviations with cutting speed and feed, within the range of cutting parameters evaluated. In addition, several parametric models have been developed from the experimental results. These models allow predicting the behavior of these deviations as a function of cutting parameters applied. In order to do this, different parametric models (potential, exponential, and polynomial) have been tested. For all analyzed geometric deviations, the exponential model has shown the best fit to the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The UNS R 56400 is a Titanium alloy {{commonly}} used in the aircraft industry. This alloy can be processed by machining depending on its final application. Drilling and turning are the most usual machining processes for working this alloy. Aerospace requirements involve high quality levels and, if possible, an on-line monitoring {{in order to preserve}} the workpiece design conditions. The machining process can be monitored by different methods. One of the most single methods involves the analysis of the finishing quality of the workpieces. This analysis is usually related to micro and macro geometrical considerations. In this paper a study of the finishing quality of dry turned UNS R 56400 Ti alloy has been achieved. This study has been carried out based on the analysis of <b>straightness</b> and parallelism <b>deviations</b> as functions of cutting parameters, such as feed and cutting speed...|$|R
40|$|In the ant species Tetramorium caespitum, {{collective}} foraging {{relies on}} group mass communication in which successful scouts lay a recruitment trail but also guide {{a group of}} nestmates to the food source. We conducted experiments to understand how group leaders may improve the success of recruits in reaching the food source and whether they adjust their leading behaviour to their audience, that is, to the following response of recruits along the foraging journey. We characterized the trajectories of leaders by measuring their <b>straightness,</b> angular <b>deviation,</b> maximal amplitude and walking speed. Trajectometric values highlighted that a straight path coupled with a slow walking speed increased the probability of followers reaching the food whereas leaders that walked at higher speed and deviated far from the food-nest beeline {{were more likely to}} lose recruits. Leaders did not seem to heed their audience since they did not reduce their speed or their path sinuosity after the loss of a recruit along their outbound journey. Information transfer about food resources by T. caespitum leaders is thus targeted towards a restricted number of recruits but without the informed individuals exerting any control over the following response of their audience. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of group recruitment compared with simpler or more sophisticated forms of information sharing and we debate the status of group recruiters regarding the concept of leadership in animal groups. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|The {{world is}} filled with objects that appear to follow some perfect model. A {{sleeping}} baby might look still and a house's roof. should be straight. However, both the baby and the roof can deviate subtly from their ideal models of perfect stillness and perfect <b>straightness.</b> These <b>deviations</b> can reveal important information like whether the baby is breathing normally or whether the house's roof is sagging. In this dissertation, we make the observation that these subtle deviations produce a visual signal that while invisible {{to the naked eye}} can be extracted from ordinary and ubiquitous images and videos. We propose new computational techniques to reveal these subtle deviations by producing new images and videos, in which the tiny deviations have been magnified. We focus on magnifying deviations from two ideal models: perfect stillness and perfect geometries in space. In the first case, we leverage the complex steerable pyramid, a localized version of the Fourier transform, whose notion of local phase can be used to process and manipulate small motions or changes from stillness in videos. In the second case, we find hidden geometric deformations in images by localizing edges to sub-pixel precision. In both cases, we experimentally validate that the tiny deviations we magnify are indeed real, comparing them to alternative ways of measuring tiny motions and subtle geometric deformations in the world. We also give a careful analysis of how noise in videos impacts our ability to see tiny motions. Additionally, we show the utility of revealing hidden deviations {{in a wide variety of}} fields, such as biology, physics and structural analysis. by Neal Wadhwa. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|The {{benefit of}} {{automatic}} vision inspection compared with human visual inspection is {{also able to}} work all the time, more consistent and accurate. The vision inspection is also able in detecting any the defective which are difficult to find by human vision. The objectives of this research are to design {{and to make the}} mechanical structure of vision inspection system. The structure should able to carry the camera to the X and Z axis. The straightness of made structure is measured to insure the movement of each axis is also straight. The measurement done by measuring the straightness of Z axis railtrack, straightness of X axis railtrack and the parallelness was of X axis railtrack. The material of the structure was ASTM A 500 hollow steel structure. The result of the stress was 3302666. 5 N/m 2 which smaller than the allowable stress of material 268895534. 6 N/m. The deflection was 0. 05443 mm which is smaller than the allowable deflection of material. The highest deviaton straightness of Z axis railtrack was at the point 75 cm from the start point. The highest <b>deviation</b> <b>straightness</b> of X axis railtrack is 1. 4 mm at the point 30 cm from the first point, the highest deviation on the straighness of the parallelnes of X axis railtrack is 57 cm from the first point. Several causes of the fault is detected from the point that have expansion of the chink of every rail, it caused during the assembly (welding) process, so that material is deformed cause of the thermal that arised in the welding process and the installation of the rail that is not straight cause the railtrack is not aligned...|$|R
