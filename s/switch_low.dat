Knowledge of device switching characteristics is required for reliable design and operation of the converters. Switching characteristics are studied widely at high current levels, and corresponding data are available in datasheets. But the devices in a converter also <b>switch</b> <b>low</b> currents close to the zero crossings of the line currents. Further, the switching behaviour under these conditions could significantly influence the output waveform quality including zero crossover distortion. Hence, the switching characteristics of high-current IGBTs (300 -A and 75 -A IGBT modules) at low load current magnitudes are investigated experimentally in this paper. The collector current, gate-emitter voltage and collector-emitter voltage are measured at various low values of current (less than 10 % of the device rated current).

It is well {{understand that the}} present practice where servers are linked by a tree hierarchy of network switches cannot gather these necessities. In this paper, we find out a newest serverinterconnection structure. The Structure observe that the commodity server machines used in today’s centralized repository generally come with three ports, one for network connection and the remaining for backup purposes. The model supposes that if three ports are aggressively used in network connections, we can construct a scalable, cost-effective interconnection structure without either the luxurious higherlevel large switches or any additional hardware on servers.

Two different 14 C-labeled plant materials, aged diatoms (Skeletonema cos-tatum) and fresh barley hay, were each mixed into intertidal sediment and spread in a 1. 5 -mm layer on the bottom of oxic and anoxic chambers. After a 27 -d incubation, conditions in all chambers were switched from aerobic to anaerobic and vice versa for 11 d. Rates of 14 C 0, evolution in diatom chambers showed that aerobic carbon mineralization was- 10 times faster than anaerobic {{both before and after the}} <b>switch.</b> <b>Low</b> rates of [14 C]DOC release suggested that the limiting step of an,aerobic decay was the initial hydrolytic and fermentative enzymatic attack on the predecomposed diatoms. Initial carbon mineralization of barley hay was not affected by the presence or absence of oxygen. Leaching of DOC from the fresh barley hay supplied anaerobic respirers with labile substrates. When leaching ceased and after the aerobic-anaerobic switch, the rate of anaerobic mineralization was reduced.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} FCC {{allocated}} 7. 5 GHz (from 3. 1 GHz to 10. 6 GHz) for ultra wideband (UWB) technology, interest has been renewed in both academic and industrial circles to exploit this vast spectrum for short range, {{high data rate}} wireless applications. The great potential of UWB {{lies in the fact}} that it can co-exist with the already licensed spectrum users and can still pave the way for a wide range of applications. However, this wide bandwidth complicates the circuit level implementation of key RF blocks like the power amplifier (PA), transmit/receive <b>switch,</b> <b>low</b> noise amplifier (LNA) and mixers in an UWB transceiver. Though expensive technologies like SiGe or GaAs have been used for transceiver realizations, the ultimate goal is to have a single-chip, low-cost solution which can only be achieved by using CMOS technology. Nevertheless, some of the inherent limitations of CMOS like lower fT of transistors make the design of UWB circuits in CMOS an extremely challenging task.

40|$|Tremendous {{growth of}} RAdio Detecting And Ranging (RADAR) and {{communication}} electronics require low manufacturing cost, excellent performance, minimum area and highly integrated solutions for transmitter/receiver (T/R) modules, which {{are one of}} the most important blocks of RADAR systems. New circuit topologies and process technologies are investigated to fulfill these requirements of next generation RADAR systems. With the recent improvements, Silicon-Germanium Bipolar CMOS technology became a good candidate for recently used III-V technologies, such as GaAs, InP, and GaN, to meet high speed and performance requirements of present RADAR applications. As new process technologies are used, new solutions and circuit architectures have to be provided while taking into account the advantages and disadvantageous of used technologies. In this thesis, a new T/R module system architecture is presented for single/onchip X-Band phased array RADAR applications. On-chip T/R module consists of five blocks; T/R switch, single-pole double-throw (SPDT) <b>switch,</b> <b>low</b> noise amplifier (LNA), power amplifier (PA), and phase shifter.

40|$|Variation in the {{quantity}} of nutrients ingested over an individual’s lifetime is likely to differentially affect distinct male secondary sexual traits and courtship signals, potentially providing females with information about a male’s past and present foraging history. We hypothesize that female choice is thus influenced by a male’s lifetime foraging history. To test this, we manipulated {{the quantity}} of nutrients (i. e. prey items) available to male wolf spiders, Schizocosa stridulans, using a fully crossed 2 × 2 design with low versus high prey quantity across juvenile and adult life stages, and assessed {{the impact of these}} diet treatments on male foreleg pigmentation, courtship rate and mating success. We found foreleg pigmentation to be dependent upon both juvenile and adult diet, with increased nutrition dependence of pigmented versus unpigmented leg segments. Despite this, the degree of foreleg pigmentation did not predict mating success. In contrast, courtship rate was not nutrient dependent, yet strongly predicted mating success. Finally, we found a significant interaction between juvenile diet, adult diet and courtship rate on mating success. Males that experienced a diet <b>switch</b> (<b>low</b> juvenile to high adult, LH; high juvenile to low adult, HL) exhibited no relationship between courtship rate and mating success, while those that experienced a consistent diet (LL; HH) showed increased mating success with increased courtship rates.

40|$|When {{disparate}} visual stimuli {{are presented}} to corresponding retinal {{locations in the}} two eyes, perception fluctuates between the presented stimuli. This phenomenon, called binocular rivalry, is an exquisite tool to dissociate sensory stimulation from visual perception. It has therefore been extensively used for studying the neural correlates of visual awareness. Initial theories have tried to explain binocular rivalry by hypothesizing the resolution of competition in V 1 through inhibitory interactions between monocular neurons. However, inter-ocular switch rivalry, a paradigm where the rivaling stimuli are rapidly exchanged between the eyes also results in stable percepts that span several swaps of the visual stimuli. This has demonstrated that competition also involves higher level stimulus representations, and not just eye based sensory information. In this study, we compared the electrophysiological correlates underlying stable visual percepts during inter-ocular switch and classical binocular rivalry. Delineating the differences and similarities between the two paradigms of rivalry will provide us with valuable information {{on the nature of}} competition during incongruent visual stimulation. We recorded EEGs while human subjects experienced inter-ocular switch and classical binocular rivalry elicited with dichoptic presentation of orthogonally oriented sinusoidal gratings. The subjects reported their percepts via button presses. We extracted and analyzed trials, where subjects reported at least one second long stable percepts. During this time window, we assessed the normalized spectrogram to visualize mean event-related changes in spectral power across a broad frequency range (1 - 45 Hz). We observed a strong and sustained increase in spectral power between 12 - 30 Hz across the two conditions approximately 300 ms following the reported perceptual <b>switch.</b> <b>Low</b> Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) was used to localize the cortical sources of the observed changes. The maps of the localized cortical sources of this increase in the spectral power during inter-ocular switch and binocular rivalry were remarkably similar and showed no significant differences. We therefore propose that both types of rivalry have similar EEG correlates in the 12 - 30 Hz frequency band during a stable visual percept...|$|E
