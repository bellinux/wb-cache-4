Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it. However, Vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges, which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods. This means that while the muscle positioning of its legs were changing, they had not yet reduced in the distal region of the limb.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Despite their {{relative}} diversity in terrestrial Permian and Triassic rocks, {{the fossil record}} of therocephalian therapsids (Eutheriodontia) and their utility for understanding evolutionary patterns in the therapsid forerunners of mammals remains poorly understood. In this study, I investigate {{the extent to which}} body <b>size</b> <b>reductions</b> and shifts in growth patterns in Triassic therocephalians were influenced by the end-Permian mass extinction (ca. 252. 3 Ma) (rather than the culmination of longer-term phylogenetic trends traceable to their Permian predecessors). Specifically, I examine whether body <b>size</b> <b>reductions</b> observed in earliest Triassic therocephalians (`Lilliput phenomena') were the product of within-lineage <b>size</b> <b>reductions,</b> differential extinctions, or rapid diversifications of new small-bodied clades. To address this question, I first review the global diversity and taxonomic composition of therocephalians from the Middle Permian through early-Middle Triassic (Chapter 1). I then present a paleobiological investigation of the Permo-Triassic therocephalian Moschorhinus as a case study on within-lineage patterns of growth and body size evolution during the end-Permian mass extinction (Chapter 2). Finally, I examine clade-wide (among-taxon) size patterns by evaluating the stratigraphic and phylogenetic components of body size evolution (Chapter 3) and the underlying influences of bone histology and growth (Chapter 4). To examine within-lineage patterns, I studied cranial sizes and limb bone histology in Permian and Triassic specimens of Moschorhinus, the largest therapsid predator found {{both before and after the}} end-Permian mass extinction. Triassic specimens were found to have significantly decreased basal skull lengths compared to Permian specimens. Histological analysis indicated that variations in body size were associated with differences in subadult growth rate and duration (traits that are highly variable in environmentally stressed extant reptile species). Small Triassic individuals tended to display limb bones with fewer growth marks and more richly vascularized bone tissues than similarly sized Permian individuals, with an abundance of radially-oriented vascular canals, corroborating the hypothesis that conditions of the earliest Triassic favored rapid growth to a minimum body size requirement in Moschorhinus and, consequently, shortened developmental times. Broader-scale `Lilliput-type' patterns were examined in a large sample of therocephalians and compared with that of their sister clade, Cynodontia, in both geologic and phylogenetic contexts. Using a museum collections-based approach, I evaluated temporal and phylogenetic distributions of body size in Permo-Triassic eutheriodonts by time series analysis, rank order correlations, and phylogenetic model fitting. Results supported significant <b>size</b> <b>reductions</b> in earliest Triassic eutheriodonts, but suggested a pattern that was underscored largely by Brownian processes and constructive selectivity (a more general tendency to evolve smaller body sizes as in background intervals). Geologically brief <b>size</b> <b>reductions</b> were likely accomplished by the ecological removal of large-bodied species without rapid originations of new small-bodied clades or shifts from long-term evolutionary patterns. Finally, a survey of growth patterns and histomorphology in limb bones of Karoo therocephalians indicated that long-term changes in bone tissue vascularization (and thus growth) correlated with evolutionary changes in body size (e. g., smaller-bodied descendants tended to have less vascularized bone tissues than their larger-bodied ancestors). Results support a synergistic model of <b>size</b> <b>reductions</b> for Triassic therocephalians, influenced both by within-lineage heterochronic shifts in survivor taxa (e. g., Moschorhinus) and cladistically inferred survival of small-bodied taxa with short growth durations (e. g., baurioids). These findings mirror the multi-causal Lilliput patterns described in marine faunas, but contrast with skeletochronologic studies that suggest slowed, prolonged shell secretion in marine benthos. Subjecting new histologic data to phylogenetic comparative methods, as in these therocephalians, will improve our understanding of the generality of growth and size shifts in Lilliput faunas and interplay between macroevolution and extinction during this and other major geologic transitions...|$|R

25|$|The {{brain is}} an ever-changing, plastic, model of {{information}} sharing and processing. In order for the brain to incorporate new experiences into a refined schema it has to undergo specific modifications to consolidate and assimilate all new information. Synaptic plasticity {{can be described as}} the changing in strength between two related neurons. Neuroplasticity is most clearly seen in the instances of REM sleep deprivation during brain maturation. Regional brain measurements in neo-natal REM sleep deprived rats displayed a significant <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> in areas such as the cerebral cortex and the brain stem. The rats were deprived during critical periods after birth and thus anatomical <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> is observed. Using a pursuit task (used to test visuomotor capabilities) in combination with an fMRI, Maquet et al., 2003, found that increases in activation were seen in the supplementary eye field and right dentate nucleus of subjects who were allowed to sleep as compared to sleep deprived individuals. The right superior temporal sulcus was also noticed to have higher activation levels. When functional connectivity was analyzed {{it was found that the}} dentate nucleus was more closely involved with the functions of the superior temporal sulcus. The results suggest that performance on the pursuit task relies on the subject's ability to comprehend appropriate movement patterns in order for recreation of the optimal movements. Sleep deprivation was found to interrupt the slow processes that lead to learning of this procedural skill and alter connectivity changes that would have normally been seen after a night of rest. Neuroplasticity has been thoroughly researched over the past few decades and results have shown that significant changes that occur in our cortical processing areas have the power to modulate neuronal firing to both new and previously experienced stimuli.|$|E
25|$|The {{inferior}} pedicle (central mound) {{features a}} blood vessel supply (arterial and venous) for the nipple-areola complex (NAC) from an inferior, centrally-based {{attachment to the}} chest wall. The skin pedicle maintains the innervation and vascular viability of the NAC, which produces a reduced, sensitive breast with full lactational capability and function. The volume and <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> of hypertrophied breasts is performed with a periareolar incision to the nipple-areola complex, which then extends downwards, following the natural curve of the breast hemisphere. After cutting and removing the requisite quantities of tissue (glandular, adipose, skin), the nipple-areola complex is transposed higher upon the breast hemisphere; thereby the inferior pedicle technique produces an elevated bust with breasts that are proportionate to the woman's person. Nonetheless, breast-reduction with an inferior pedicle, occasionally produces breasts that appear squared; yet, the technique effectively reduces the very enlarged breasts of macromastia and gigantomastia.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{estimates}} of the range loss of mountain plants under climate change have so far mostly relied on static geographical projections of species' habitat shifts(1 - 3). Here, we use a hybrid model(4) that combines such projections with simulations of demography and seed dispersal to forecast the climate-driven spatio-temporal dynamics of 150 high-mountain plant species across the European Alps. This model predicts average range <b>size</b> <b>reductions</b> of 44 - 50 % {{by the end of}} the twenty-first century, which is similar to projections from the most 'optimistic' static model (49 %). However, the hybrid model also indicates that population dynamics will lag behind climatic trends and that an average of 40 % of the range still occupied at the end of the twenty-first century will have become climatically unsuitable for the respective species, creating an extinction debt(5, 6). Alarmingly, species endemic to the Alps seem to face the highest range losses.

25|$|High solids (dry) digesters are {{designed}} to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries, high solids (dry – stackable substrate) digesters {{are designed}} to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed {{into the top of}} the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. <b>Size</b> <b>reduction</b> (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a total suspended solids (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.|$|E
25|$|Smaller MOSFETs are {{desirable}} for several reasons. The main reason to make transistors smaller is to pack {{more and more}} devices in a given chip area. This results in a chip with the same functionality in a smaller area, or chips with more functionality in the same area. Since fabrication costs for a semiconductor wafer are relatively fixed, the cost per integrated circuits is mainly related {{to the number of}} chips that can be produced per wafer. Hence, smaller ICs allow more chips per wafer, reducing the price per chip. In fact, over the past 30 years the number of transistors per chip has been doubled every 2–3 years once a new technology node is introduced. For example, the number of MOSFETs in a microprocessor fabricated in a 45 nm technology can well be twice as many as in a 65 nm chip. This doubling of transistor density was first observed by Gordon Moore in 1965 and is commonly referred to as Moore's law. It is also expected that smaller transistors switch faster. For example, one approach to <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> is a scaling of the MOSFET that requires all device dimensions to reduce proportionally. The main device dimensions are the channel length, channel width, and oxide thickness. When they are scaled down by equal factors, the transistor channel resistance does not change, while gate capacitance is cut by that factor. Hence, the RC delay of the transistor scales with a similar factor. While this has been traditionally the case for the older technologies, for the state-of-the-art MOSFETs reduction of the transistor dimensions does not necessarily translate to higher chip speed because the delay due to interconnections is more significant.|$|E
