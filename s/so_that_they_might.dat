5|$|While Rastignac desires {{wealth and}} social status, Goriot longs {{only for the}} love of his daughters: a longing that borders on idolatry. Because he {{represents}} bourgeois wealth acquired through trade– and not aristocratic primitive accumulation– his daughters are happy to take his money, but will see him only in private. Even as he is dying in extreme poverty, {{at the end of the}} book, he sells his few remaining possessions to provide for his daughters <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> look splendid at a ball.|$|E
5|$|With Chadwick {{involved}} {{the main goal}} was {{to show that the}} Quebec Agreement was a success. It was Britain's duty to co-operate to the fullest and speed along the process. Chadwick used this opportunity to give as many young British scientists experience as possible <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> carry that experience to post-war Britain. He eventually convinced Groves of Rotblat's integrity to the cause, and this led to Rotblat being accepted to the Manhattan Project without renouncing his nationality. Rotblat had been left in charge of the Tube Alloys research, and brought with him the results obtained since Chadwick had left.|$|E

25|$|He {{was equally}} {{comfortable}} distributing his translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care to his bishops <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges.

25|$|Rabbi Akiva (or {{some say}} Rabban Johanan ben Zakai) never {{said in the}} house of study {{that it was time to}} stop studying, except on the eve of Passover and the eve of the Yom Kippur.

25|$|Over the years, {{many people}} have asked me how I run the Naval Reactors Program, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> find some benefit for their own work. I am always chagrined at the {{tendency}} of people to expect that I have a simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.|$|E
25|$|Qadis (Judges) were {{appointed}} at all administrative levels {{for the administration}} of justice. The Qadis were chosen for their integrity and learning in Islamic law. High salaries were fixed for the Qadis {{so that there was}} no temptation to bribery. Wealthy men and men of high social status {{were appointed}} as Qadis <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> not have the temptation to take bribes, or be influenced by the social position of any body. The Qadis were not allowed to engage in trade. Judges were appointed in sufficient number, and there was no district which did not have a Qadi.|$|E
25|$|Captain William Bligh was {{her first}} commander, {{assigned}} to her to supervise her conversion. He took command on 16 April 1795 and commissioned her in May. In October 1795, {{the crew of the}} 74-gun HMS Defiance (then commanded by Captain Sir George Horne) mutinied. Bligh, in Calcutta, was ordered to embark 200 troops and take them alongside Defiance <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> board her and regain control. The threat of the soldiers ended the mutiny for the time being, though the crew of the Defiance mutinied again in 1797 and 1798. Bligh continued to command Calcutta until she was paid off in February 1796 and transferred to the Transport Board.|$|E

5000|$|Tony Rayns of Film Comment wrote that, unlike Tsai's {{previous}} films, Stray Dogs [...] "does away {{almost completely}} with continuity editing. Most of its scenes are single shots, and there's no causal link {{between one and}} the next. Some shots are <b>so</b> realist <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could have been taken with a hidden camera.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the Sultanate of Hobyo and Italy soured when Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid refused the Italians' proposal to allow British troops to disembark in his Sultanate <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> then pursue their battle against Hassan's Dervish forces. Viewed as {{too much of a}} threat by the Italians, Kenadid was exiled first to the British-controlled Aden Protectorate, and then to Italian Eritrea, as was his son Ali Yusuf, the heir apparent to his throne. In May, the British Foreign Office realised the error, and had Kenadid's son appointed regent, just in time to forestall an attack in Mudug by the Sultan's army.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{relationship}} between Hobyo and Italy soured when Sultan Kenadid refused the Italians' proposal to allow a British contingent of troops to disembark in his Sultanate <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> then pursue their battle against the Somali religious and nationalist leader Mohammed Abdullah Hassan's Dervish forces. Viewed as {{too much of a}} threat by the Italians, Sultan Kenadid was eventually exiled to Aden in Yemen and then to Eritrea, as was his son Ali Yusuf, the heir apparent to his throne. However, unlike the southern territories, the northern sultanates were not subject to direct rule due to the earlier treaties they had signed with the Italians.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opinion}} of William Siborne a {{contemporary}} British historian, Thielmann's position was certainly a very favourable one, and the occupation of it was arranged with great skill. It was impossible to foresee in what manner the attack upon it would be conducted--whether it would be directed against one particular bridge, or against all the bridges, with the design of carrying the whole Line by storm. Thielmann therefore limited the occupation {{of the town and}} of the line of the river to the number of light troops that might be sufficient for sustaining any sudden assault, taking care to have support close at hand for that purpose. However, he placed his reserves, which comprised his main force, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> become available at any point which might be pressed. Should the French develop greatly superior numbers, as was subsequently the case, that would serve to guard against any flank attack.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the Sultanate of Hobyo and Italy soured when Sultan Kenadid refused the Italians' proposal to allow a British contingent of troops to disembark in his Sultanate <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> then pursue their battle against the Somali religious and nationalist leader Muhammad Abdullah Hassan's Dervish forces. Viewed as {{too much of a}} threat, Sultan Kenadid was eventually exiled to Aden in Yemen and then to Eritrea. His son Ali Yusuf Kenadid succeeded him on the throne. In 1924, Governor Cesare Maria De Vecchi adopted a policy of dismarment of the northern Somali Sultanates. Sultan Ali Yusuf Kenadid was thereafter in turn exiled. By November 1927, the forces of Sultan Osman Mahamuud of the Majeerteen Sultanate were also defeated. The Dubats colonial troops and the Zaptié gendarmerie were extensively used by De Vecchi during these military campaigns. However, unlike the southern territories, the northern sultanates were not subject to direct rule due to the earlier treaties they had signed with the Italians.|$|E

500|$|This {{recruiting}} of cantors was {{not without}} controversy: Cantor Cuper (also known as Kupfer), the head cantor of the Great Synagogue, considered it [...] "impious" [...] that cantors should perform in a secular setting, to crowds where both sexes mingled freely, keeping people up late <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> not be on time for morning prayers.|$|E

50|$|The Passerida quite {{certainly}} {{consist of}} the 3 major subclades outlined by Sibley & Ahlquist (1990). However, their content {{has been much}} revised.
