25|$|With the Great Western, Isambard Kingdom Brunel {{laid the}} {{foundations}} for new shipbuilding techniques. He realised that the carrying capacity of a ship increases as the cube of its dimensions, whilst the water resistance only increases as the square of its dimensions. This means that large ships are more fuel-efficient, <b>something</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> for long voyages across the Atlantic. Constructing large ships was therefore more profitable. Moreover, migration to the Americas increased enormously. These movements of population were a financial windfall for the shipping companies, {{some of the largest}} of which were founded during this time. Examples are the P of the United Kingdom in 1822 and the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique of France in 1855.|$|E

In 1836 Isambard Kingdom Brunel {{and a group of}} Bristol investors formed the Great Western Steamship Company to build a line of steamships for the Bristol-New York route. The idea of regular scheduled transatlantic service was under discussion by several groups and the rival British and American Steam Navigation Company was established at the same time. [...] Great Western's design sparked controversy from critics that contended that she was too big. The principle that Brunel understood was that the carrying capacity of a hull increases as the cube of its dimensions, whilst the water resistance only increases as the square of its dimensions.

Shepherds crossed these boundaries and constantly moved in what could be considered a liminal space, ‘floating between two worlds’, an expression used by Van Gennep (1960, p. 18).|$|R

2500|$|Sylvia, and Coppélia before it, {{are often}} touted {{as two of}} the first modern ballets for their novel scores. Tchaikovsky himself remarked to fellow {{composer}} Sergei Taneyev upon the ingenuity of Sylvia, calling it [...] "... the first ballet, where the music constitutes not only the main, but the only interest. What charm, what elegance, what richness of melody, rhythm, harmony." [...] While this statement {{may be a little}} hyperbolic, it says <b>something</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> about the uniqueness of the ballet. Sylvias score is varied and rich, and it stands out, drawing the focus from the sets, the dancers, the costumes. Instead of receding into the background, setting only the mood, Delibes' score sets the action. The music of Sylvia was also notable for its new, more developed use of leitmotifs. Such a stylistic choice is characteristic of Delibes, who was a great admirer of Wagner. Indeed, echoes of Wagner's influence are quite obvious in the music such as its [...] "symphonic" [...] nature, as described by Ivor Forbes Guest in the 1954 edition of The Ballet Annual.|$|E

To have the picture {{complete}} {{at the same time}} the figures do their part in producing the particular illusion required--what a perfection and what a joy! I know no answer to that save the aggressive, objectionable fact. Simply look at the stage of to-day and observe that these two branches of the matter never do happen to go together. There is evidently a corrosive principle in the large command of machinery and decorations--a germ of perversion and corruption. It gets the upperhand--it becomes the master. It is so much less easy to get good actors than good scenery and to represent a situation by the delicacy of personal art than by [...] "building it in" [...] and having everything real. Surely there is no reality worth a farthing, on the stage, but what the actor gives, and only when he has learned his business up to the hilt need he concern himself with his material accessories.
