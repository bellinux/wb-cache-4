5|$|According to Allmusic the {{original}} track was 3:09, {{but when it}} appeared on the 2006 compilation album Essential Nancy Sinatra, it was 3:11. The single was initially released through Reprise Records. In a non-exclusive licensing agreement, Reprise (part of Warner Music) gave RCA Records the rights to distribute the records {{of some of their}} artists including <b>Sinatra</b> <b>and</b> Dean Martin. In 1971, <b>Sinatra</b> <b>and</b> Reprise parted ways, so she signed a long-term contract with RCA Records.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} two {{specials}} under this new relationship aired on February 25, 1962 and was entitled The Judy Garland Show. This special, guest starring Frank <b>Sinatra</b> <b>and</b> Dean Martin, was nominated for four Emmys. Its success led to CBS signing Garland in December 1962 for her weekly series, premiering in fall 1963. Garland's second special was the awkwardly-titled Judy Garland and Her Guests Phil Silvers and Robert Goulet, presented in March 1963. Alternately promoted as a preview and a pilot for Garland's upcoming regular series, this special was also nominated for an Emmy.|$|E

5|$|Under Sinatra, the Celebrity Room {{was added}} {{alongside}} a helipad and it opened year round. His ownership gradually {{increased over the}} following two years until he owned 50 percent outright. But Giancana's attendance at the property first provoked a rift between <b>Sinatra</b> <b>and</b> share holder Hank Sanicola, and later resulted in Sinatra's gambling license being suspended by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. He initially leased the property to Jack L. Warner and later in 1968 {{to a group of}} investors. It passed through the hands of a series of investment groups until 1976 when it was bought by Kirk Kerkorian. The property closed for renovations in 2013 and has not reopened since. Larry Ellison made a winning bid to purchase the property out of bankruptcy in 2017.|$|E
5|$|His {{mother left}} {{soon after he}} was born, and his father {{remarried}} and also moved away, leaving Willie and his sister Bobbie to be raised by their grandparents. The Nelsons, who taught singing back in Arkansas, started their grandchildren in music. Nelson's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six, and taught him a few chords, and with his sister Bobbie, he sang gospel songs in the local church. He wrote his first song at age seven, {{and when he was}} nine, played guitar for the local band Bohemian Polka. During the summer, the family picked cotton along with other citizens of Abbott. Nelson disliked picking cotton, so he earned money by singing in dance halls, taverns, and honky tonks from age 13, and continuing through high school. Nelson's musical influences were Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, Ray Price, Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Django Reinhardt, Frank <b>Sinatra</b> <b>and</b> Louis Armstrong.|$|E
5|$|Of all the U.S. Presidents he {{associated}} with during his career, he was closest to John F. Kennedy. Sinatra often invited Kennedy to Hollywood and Las Vegas, {{and the two}} would womanize and enjoy parties together. In January 1961 <b>Sinatra</b> <b>and</b> Peter Lawford organized the Inaugural Gala in Washington, D.C., held on the evening before President Kennedy was sworn into office. In 1962, Sinatra was snubbed by Kennedy {{during his visit to}} Palm Springs when he decided to stay with the Republican Bing Crosby, due to FBI concerns about Sinatra's alleged connections to organized crime. Sinatra had invested a lot of his own money in upgrading the facilities at his home in anticipation of the President's visit, fitting it with a heliport, which he later reportedly smashed up with a sledgehammer upon being rejected. Despite the snub, when he learned of Kennedy's assassination he reportedly sobbed in his bedroom for three days.|$|E
50|$|In {{the span}} of a few years, Las Vegas refueled Frank <b>Sinatra's</b> career <b>and</b> <b>Sinatra</b> in turn became the lead figure in the city's ascendance. It was a {{synergistic}} relationship that has since become legendary {{in the annals of}} 20th century entertainment.|$|R

5|$|The Sinatra period saw extravagant {{parties and}} visits by celebrities such as Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli, Kim Novak, Shirley MacLaine, Sammy Davis Jr., Tony Curtis, Janet Leigh, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz and Richard Crenna. However, his mood swings would {{sometimes}} determine how {{he responded to}} patrons. Journalist Herb Caen reported {{that he could be}} dismissive and insulting to those who annoyed him. Giancana was banned from the state of Nevada, but Sinatra continued to allow him to stay at the lodge which resulted in Sanicola seeking to remove himself as a shareholder. Although Sinatra sought to explain that Giancana was only visiting his girlfriend, Phyllis McGuire, the disagreement resulted in the end of <b>Sinatra</b> <b>and</b> Sanicola's friendship. After Giancana was spotted on the premises, Sinatra had his gambling license removed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. Following this, Sinatra decided he {{wanted to get out of}} entertainment property ownership as he was being heavily criticized in the national press and pursued by law enforcement over illegal activities at the casino. The Cal Neva Lodge was leased to Jack L. Warner in a deal which also saw a majority stake in Reprise Records sold to Warner Bros. Records and Sinatra gaining a one-third ownership in the new company.|$|E
