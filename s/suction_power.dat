The biggest case of his legal career was a 1996 product liability lawsuit against Sta-Rite, the manufacturer of a defective pool drain cover. The case involved Valerie Lakey, a three-year-old girl who was disemboweled by the <b>suction</b> <b>power</b> of the pool drain pump when she sat on an open pool drain whose protective cover had been removed by other children at the pool, after the swim club had failed to install the cover properly. Despite 12 prior suits with similar claims, Sta-Rite continued to make and sell drain covers lacking warnings. Sta-Rite protested that an additional warning would have made no difference because the pool owners already knew the importance of keeping the cover secured.|$|E

It is possible to make use of predetermination of performance of a new pump. 　Several pressure supplying devices are jointed in a suction line to examine their effects on improvement of performance of vane pumps. 　In order to smooth the pressure variation from suctiOn port to delivery one along the casing, the delivery pressure of a booster should be effectively increased rather than its discharge. As the product of delivery pressure and discharge works for the pressure variation in the casing, the booster is more available when it has an additional tank. The expansion line close to the suction port of a pump works as same as the booster, and its work becomes more effective as its vertical height increased. 　The vane pump without vane pins will be safely operated by effective control of back pressure to the grooves for the vanes...|$|R

50|$|The {{legacy of}} carpet {{sweepers}} {{lives on in}} floor cleaning robots that have limited <b>suction</b> <b>power</b> and rely on sweeping to collect larger bits of debris from the floor. While some research models of robotic vacuums only rely on vacuum motors, models on the market such as Roomba or bObsweep invariably combine suction and sweeping.|$|E
50|$|In fixed-installation {{central vacuum}} cleaners, the cleaned air may be {{exhausted}} directly outside without {{need for further}} filtration. A well-designed cyclonic filtration system loses <b>suction</b> <b>power</b> due to airflow restriction only when the collection vessel is almost full.

50|$|Centrifugal oil {{and water}} {{separators}} do have their disadvantages. One known disadvantage of these separators is {{that they tend to}} have low <b>powered</b> <b>suction.</b> For example, when the pump end is dry and the impeller is rotating at high speeds, it is simply not powerful enough to lift the oily water mixture into the separator. For this reason, these separators must always be primed before use.|$|R
50|$|The main advancements in {{neurosurgery}} {{came about}} {{as a result of}} highly crafted tools. Modern neurosurgical tools, or instruments, include chisels, curettes, dissectors, distractors, elevators, forcepts, hooks, impactors, probes, <b>suction</b> tubes, <b>power</b> tools, and robots. Most of these modern tools, like chisels, elevators, forcepts, hooks, impactors, and probes, have been in medical practice for a relatively long time. The main difference of these tools, pre and post advancement in neurosurgery, were the precision in which they were crafted. These tools are crafted with edges that are within a millimeter of desired accuracy. Other tools such as hand held power saws and robots have only recently been commonly used inside of a neurological operating room.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, several {{companies}} developed robotic vacuum cleaners, {{a form of}} carpet sweeper usually equipped with limited <b>suction</b> <b>power.</b> Some prominent brands are Roomba, Neato, and bObsweep. These machines move autonomously while collecting surface dust and debris into a dustbin.

Most models are equipped with motorized brushes and a vacuum motor to collect dust and debris. While most robotic vacuum cleaners are designed for home use, some models are appropriate for operation in offices, hotels, hospitals, etc.|$|E

40|$|Downward seepage (suction) {{increases}} {{the mobility of}} the channel. In this study, experimental investigations were carried out to analyse the suction effect on stream power along the downstream side of the flume. It was observed that stream power has {{a major influence on}} the stability and mobility of the bed particles, due to <b>suction.</b> Stream <b>power</b> is found to be greater at the upstream side and lower at the downstream side. This reduces the increment in the mobility of the sand particles due to suction at the downstream side. Thus, there is more erosion at the upstream side than the downstream side. It was also found that the amount of deposition of sand particles at the downstream side, because of the high stream power at the upstream side, is greater than the amount of erosion of sand particles from the downstream side...|$|R
50|$|Phonetically, a linguo-glottalic {{consonant}} is a {{click in}} which the forward and rear articulations are released independently. The forward articulation, made with the lips or {{the front of the}} tongue, releases with a lingual airstream as in any click. The rear articulation, however, is held longer, and when it is released, it is with a glottalic airstream. (Linguo-pulmonic consonants are similar, except that the second release is pulmonic, as in English consonants.) That is, such consonants have a double release burst, one ingressive (the air pulled in by the tongue) and the other egressive (the air pushed out by the glottis). The rear articulation is involved in both: it helps create the <b>suction</b> that <b>powers</b> the first, and then is itself released for the second. Because the back of the tongue operates in the uvular or pharyngeal part of the mouth to generate the first burst, and the two bursts are very close together in time, the second release is articulated in approximately this same area.|$|R
50|$|Canister models (in the UK {{also often}} called {{cylinder}} models) dominate the European market. They have the motor and dust collector (using a bag or bagless) {{in a separate}} unit, usually mounted on wheels, which {{is connected to the}} vacuum head by a flexible hose. Their main advantage is flexibility, as the user can attach different heads for different tasks, and maneuverability (the head can reach under furniture and makes it very easy to vacuum stairs and vertical surfaces). Many cylinder models have power heads as standard or add-on equipment containing the same sort of mechanical beaters as in upright units, making them as efficient on carpets as upright models. Such beaters are driven by a separate electric motor or a turbine which uses the <b>suction</b> <b>power</b> to spin the brushroll via a drive belt.|$|E

5000|$|In 1982, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the Heritage model, the Turbo Brush was introduced, which consisted of a smaller version of the Rug Nozzle and a belt-driven rotating vibrating brush, but it had a small turbine within <b>powered</b> by the <b>suction</b> of the <b>power</b> unit to spin the brush, designed to make vacuuming carpeted stairs easier and removing embedded hair from upholstery and automobile interiors.

40|$|Ongoing {{anatomical}} development typically {{results in}} a gradual maturation of the feeding movements from larval to adult fishes. Adult seahorses are known to capture prey by rotating their longsnouted head extremely quickly towards prey, followed by powerful suction. This type of <b>suction</b> is <b>powered</b> by elastic recoil and requires very precise coordination of {{the movements of the}} associated feeding structures, making it an all-or-none phenomenon. Here, we show that newborn Hippocampus reidi are able to successfully feed using an extremely rapid and powerful snout rotation combined with a high-volume suction, surpassing that observed in adult seahorses. An inverse dynamic analysis shows that an elastic recoil mechanism is also used to power head rotation in newborn H. reidi. This illustrates how extreme levels of performance in highly complex musculoskeletal systems can be present at birth given a delayed birth and rapid development of functionally important structures. The fact that the head skeleton of newborn seahorses is still largely cartilaginous may not be problematic because the hydrodynamic stress on the rotating snout appeared considerably lower than in adult syngnathids...|$|R
50|$|Bag {{breakage}} is {{an issue}} that arises with filtered central vacuums. In a portable vacuum, if the filter bag fails, this condition becomes immediately obvious as a cloud of dust and dirt blows into the room. Although it creates a mess, at least the problem can be immediately brought under control by shutting off the appliance. By contrast, if the filter bag in a central unit should fail, little change may be noticed by the remote operator. In fact, the only perceivable change may be an increase in <b>suction</b> <b>power</b> as a clogged but broken bag is completely bypassed. If the filtered air is also used to cool the motor (a very typical design), the first clue that something is amiss may be when the motor completely seizes up due to dirt accumulating in the motor brushes, windings, or bearings. Such a failure can require complete replacement of the expensive central unit.|$|E
50|$|Hot water {{extraction}} equipment {{may be a}} portable unit that plugs into an electrical outlet, or a truck mount carpet cleaner requiring long hoses from the truck or trailer. Truck mounted equipment may be used where electricity is unavailable (e.g. if electrical service was terminated). Truck mount carpet cleaning may be unsuited to premises distant from a driveway or road, and hoses may need to pass through windows to reach upper floors of a building. Hoses needed for truck mount and professional portable carpet cleaning may present an inconvenience or tripping hazard to users of hallways, and pets or children can escape through doors that must be left ajar for hoses. Heated or air conditioned air will also escape from buildings when doors are left open for hoses, potentially creating a significant waste of energy. Truck mounted carpet cleaning equipment minimizes noise in the room being cleaned, but may cause noise and air pollution offensive to neighbors, and may violate anti-idling bylaws in some jurisdictions. However, truck-mounted cleaning is much faster than portable equipment, and the extra heat will dissolve more spots and stains, and more vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>power</b> will reduce drying times.|$|E
5000|$|The Mod 4 {{series was}} {{introduced}} in 1974, but was generally not successful in the marketplace. However, in post-mortem consumer research, the Spot Vac was highly successful with women, who borrowed it from their husband's workbench in the basement to clean up minor spills {{in the kitchen and}} upstairs. This inspired the design of a new household product specifically for use upstairs by women. The product appearance was completely re-designed by Gantz's design patent, the first design patent ever filed by B&D, renamed the Dustbuster, and introduced in January 1979 as a household product, not a power tool. Gantz was Manager of the Black & Decker United States Consumer Power Tool Division's Industrial Design Department at the time. Over a million Dustbusters were sold in its first year, four times that of the traditional handheld vacuum market and its success enabled B&D to establish a new Household Products Division, which in 1983, acquired and merged with General Electric Housewares Operations in Bridgeport, CT. By 1985, B&D had the lion's share of cordless vacuum cleaner market and the Dustbuster sold 7 million units annually. [...] It also came in 110 volts with an attachable hose and tools. The device used <b>suction</b> <b>power</b> to pick up fine dirt and debris including pet hair.|$|E
50|$|Trichodinids are round ciliates {{that may}} be {{disc-shaped}} or hemispherical. The cytostome (cell mouth) is on the surface that faces away from the host; this is termed the oral surface. The other side, or aboral surface, attaches to {{the skin of the}} host or other substrate. There is a spiral of cilia leading towards the cytostome and several rings of cilia at the periphery of the cell, responsible for creating adhesive <b>suction</b> and locomotory <b>power.</b> In the taxonomy of trichodinids, the exact number, shape and arrangement of the cytoskeletal denticles is critical for determining taxonomic relationships. These characters are usually revealed by silver nitrate staining of microscope slides, which stains the cell cytoplasm black and leaves the denticles white.|$|R
40|$|To {{simplify the}} design of swept {{supercritical}} (SC) Laminar Flow Control (LFC) wings and maintain satisfactory low speed characteristics, blunt-nosed swept SC LFC wings without nose flaps and lower wing loadings were studied. Their boundary layer crossflow in the leading edge area is optimally controlled (1) by compensating the boundary layer crossflow of the front acceleration zone by an opposite crossflow in a downstream pressure rise area, (2) by maintaining a neutrally stable boundary layer crossflow by suction within a narrow spanwise suction strip located close to the wing attachment line in the front acceleration zone.

40|$|Low-frequency, unsteady, lifting-line {{theory is}} used to {{characterize}} the energetics and optimum motion of an unswept rigid wing oscillating harmonically in an inviscid, incompressible flow. The energetics calculations account for the leading edge <b>suction</b> force, the <b>power</b> absorbed in the wing oscillations, and the energy loss rate produced by vortex shedding. Optimization is achieved by minimizing the average energy loss rate {{in relation to a}} given thrust, and a unique solution is found in the three dimensional case for low, reduced frequencies. The two-dimensional solution is nonunique, a condition which is examined in terms of the normal modes of the energy loss rate matrix. An invisible mode with a hydrodynamic efficiency of 100 pct is obtained in the two-dimensional case, causing the nonuniqueness of the solution by yielding no fixed positive thrust through perfect unsteady feathering...|$|R
