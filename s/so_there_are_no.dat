5|$|No comets with an {{eccentricity}} {{significantly greater}} than one have been observed, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> confirmed observations of comets {{that are likely to}} have originated outside the Solar System. Comet C/1980 E1 had an orbital period of roughly 7.1 million years before the 1982 perihelion passage, but a 1980 encounter with Jupiter accelerated the comet giving it the largest eccentricity (1.057) of any known hyperbolic comet. Comets not expected to return to the inner Solar System include C/1980 E1, C/2000 U5, C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), C/2009 R1, C/1956 R1, and C/2007 F1 (LONEOS).|$|E
5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} from the Holy Land in 1291, European {{familiarity}} with the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until the}} 19thcentury that interest in these buildings was renewed, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Crois√©s en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E

25|$|But Mullan biographer Keith Peterson {{has argued}} that Mullan spent no time in Florida, or at most a few weeks. Peterson notes that Mullan {{remained}} in Louisiana with Company H until at least January 1856, when {{he was ordered to}} report to Company A at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. Mullan did not report to Company A until March 5, so it is possible that he spent part of January and February in Florida. But if <b>so,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> Army records of it and his time there would be brief at best. Mullan was detached from Company A in May and June 1856, but this would have left him almost no time to travel to and fight in Florida. He returned to Company A in early July 1856, and remained there until Company A was transferred to Fort Leavenworth in the Kansas Territory. He remained in Kansas until December 1857, when he was transferred to Washington, D.C., to work with Isaac Stevens again.|$|E
500|$|The global {{population}} of the Bohemian waxwing has been estimated at more than threemillion birds, and the breeding range covers about 12.8millionkm2 (4.9millionmi2). Although this species' population, as of 2013, appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid nor large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and huge breeding area, this waxwing is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. [...] The woodlands used by this species are well {{to the north of}} major human populations, and the birds can use disturbed habitats, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> serious long-term threats to this species.|$|E

And for that reason, many people who owned the Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL) [...] which are known to be a very difficult load for amplifiers [...] would choose the NAIT to drive their speakers. Reviewers attribute the perception of power of the NAITs to the over-engineered, dedicated power supplies that ensure generous current delivery for musical transients.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} years of the program, the Gophers had several rivalries that have not {{extended}} into the modern era. [...] Among them was a rivalry with Hamline University, now a Division III school in St. Paul. [...] Hamline had one of the earliest college basketball programs in the country and it was several years before Minnesota competed on equal footing with them; they played as late as 1935. [...] The greatest rival of {{the early years}} of the program was the Minnesota Aggies, representing the Minnesota School of Agriculture and Mining, which has since been incorporated into the University of Minnesota Twin Cities as the St. Paul campus. [...] Minnesota A dominated the Gophers, winning ten consecutive games; Minnesota did not get its first win against the Aggies until 1899. [...] This rivalry expired especially early, and the two teams did not meet after 1901.

500|$|The Persian {{archives}} {{were lost}} <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> contemporary Persian sources of this war. However, al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings uses now lost sources and contains {{a history of}} the Sassanid dynasty. Non-Greek contemporary sources include the Chronicle of John of Nikiu, which was written in Coptic but only survives in Ethiopian translation, and the History attributed to Sebeos (there is controversy over the authorship). The latter is an Armenian compilation of various sources, arranged in only rough chronological order. This gives it an uneven coverage of the war. Furthermore, it was put together with the purpose of correlating Biblical prophecy and contemporary times, making it most certainly not objective. There are also some surviving Syriac materials from that period, which Dodgeon, Greatrex, and Lieu believe are the [...] "most important" [...] of the contemporary sources. These include the Chronicle of 724 by Thomas the Presbyter, composed in 640. The Chronicle of Guidi or Khuzistan Chronicle gives the perspective of a Nestorian Christian living in Persian territory.|$|E
