2500|$|Some plants become {{dominant}} when {{introduced into}} new environments because {{the animals in}} their original environment, that compete with them or feed on them are absent; in what is sometimes called the “natural enemies hypothesis”, plants freed from these specialist consumers may become dominant. An example is Klamath weed, that threatened millions of hectares of prime grain and grazing land in North America after it was accidentally introduced, but {{was reduced to a}} rare roadside weed within several years after some of its natural enemies were imported during World War II. In locations where predation and mutually competitive relationships are absent, weeds have increased resources available for growth and reproduction. The weediness of some species that are introduced into new environments may be caused by their production of allelopathic chemicals which indigenous plants are not yet adapted to, a scenario sometimes called the [...] "novel weapons hypothesis".

6000|$|It {{follows from}} these few facts that {{different}} kinds of seeds excite the leaves in very different degrees; whether this is solely {{due to the nature}} of their coats is not clear. In the case of the cress seeds, the partial removal of the layer of mucus hastened the inflection of the tentacles. Whenever the leaves remain inflected during several days over seeds, it is clear that they absorb some matter from them. That the secretion penetrates their coats is also evident from the large proportion of cabbage, raddish, and cress seeds which were killed, and from several of the seedlings being greatly injured. This injury to the <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>seedlings</b> may, however, be due solely to the acid of the secretion, and not to any process of digestion; for Mr. Traherne Moggridge has shown that very weak acids of the acetic series are highly injurious to seeds. It never occurred to me to observe whether seeds are often blown on to the viscid leaves of plants growing in a state of nature; but this can hardly fail sometimes to occur, as we shall hereafter see in the case of Pinguicula. If so, Drosera will profit to a slight degree by absorbing matter from such seeds.] ...|$|E
60|$|A fine plant {{growing in}} my garden (one of the {{foregoing}} seedlings) {{was covered with a}} net, and six flowers were crossed with pollen from another flower on the same plant, and six others were fertilised with their own pollen. All produced good capsules. The seeds from each were placed in separate watch-glasses, and no difference could be perceived by the eye between the two lots of seeds; and when they were weighed there was no difference of any significance, as the seeds from the self-fertilised capsules weighed 7.65 grains, whilst those from the crossed capsules weighed 7.7 grains. Therefore the sterility of the present species, when insects are excluded, is not due to the impotence of pollen on the stigma of the same flower. Both lots of <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>seedlings</b> were treated in exactly the same manner as in Table 3/23, excepting that after the pairs of germinating seeds had been planted on the opposite sides of eight pots, all the remaining seeds were thickly sown on the opposite sides of Pots 9 and 10 in Table 3/24. The young plants during the following spring were turned out of their pots, without being disturbed, and planted in the open ground in two rows, not very close together, so that they were subjected to only moderately severe competition with one another. Very differently to what occurred in the first experiment, when the plants were subjected to somewhat severe mutual competition, an equal number on each side either died or did not produce flower-stems.

60|$|This {{extraordinary}} {{diversity in}} the means for favouring or preventing cross- and self-fertilisation in closely allied forms, probably depends {{on the results of}} both processes being highly beneficial to the species, but directly opposed in many ways to one another and dependent on variable conditions. Self-fertilisation assures the production of a large supply of seeds; and the necessity or advantage of this will be determined by the average length of life of the plant, which largely depends on the amount of destruction suffered by the <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>seedlings.</b> This destruction follows from the most various and variable causes, such as the presence of animals of several kinds, and the growth of surrounding plants. The possibility of cross-fertilisation depends mainly on the presence and number of certain insects, often of insects belonging to special groups, and on {{the degree to which they}} are attracted to the flowers of any particular species in preference to other flowers,--all circumstances likely to change. Moreover, the advantages which follow from cross-fertilisation differ much in different plants, so that it is probable that allied plants would often profit in different degrees by cross-fertilisation. Under these extremely complex and fluctuating conditions, with two somewhat opposed ends to be gained, namely, the safe propagation of the species and the production of cross-fertilised, vigorous offspring, it is not surprising that allied forms should exhibit an extreme {{diversity in the}} means which favour either end. If, as there is reason to suspect, self-fertilisation is in some respects beneficial, although more than counterbalanced by the advantages derived from a cross with a fresh stock, the problem becomes still more complicated.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Genetic differences, {{extent of}} hybrid vigor, nature of gene action, {{heritability}} estimates, and associations among characteristics, and between progenies {{and their respective}} mid-parents were determined for <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> plant characteristics in white clover (Trifolium repens L.). Ten <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> <b>seedling</b> vigor characteristics, including seed weight, ATP content in <b>seed,</b> <b>seed</b> respiration, <b>and</b> <b>seedling</b> vigor index were studied for a diallel cross consisting of 28 single crosses, five test-crosses, four checks, <b>and</b> eight open-pollinated <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> <b>seedlings.</b> Twenty-three plant characteristics on stolon, petiole, leaf, and forage were examined on the eight clones diallel cross, five test-crosses, three checks, the eight parental clones of single crosses, and six parent clones of the test-crosses. These 14 parent clones {{for this study were}} assembled on the basis of diverse morphology <b>and</b> origin. Most <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> <b>seedling</b> vigor characteristics, except RQ values, and most plant characteristics, except internode length, LAR and diurnal ratio in SLW, expressed significant differences among and within most groups of progenies and parental clones. All <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> <b>seedling</b> vigor characteristics, except RQ values, responded primarily to the nonadditive type of gene action. This suggests that the plant breeder should design his breeding program to develop varieties where hybrid vigor can be used to advantage. Among the criteria used in this study to measure <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> <b>seedling</b> vigor, ATP content per seed was closely associated with <b>seedling</b> vigor index <b>and</b> with certain plant characteristics, including forage yield per plant. The associations of seed weight with other <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> <b>seedling</b> vigor characteristics were negative or poor. Most plant characteristics showed apparent hybrid vigor when progenies were compared with their respective mid-parents. With few exceptions, most plant characteristics, stolon, petiole, leaf and forage yield per plant, responded primarily to the nonadditive gene system. This indicated that the plant breeder may use the hybrid approach to white clover variety development. The exceptions were leaf ratio and SLW which responded primarily to additive gene action, and area and dry weight per leaf appeared to respond equally to additive and nonadditive gene action. Genetic differences were more readily identified for stolon number and length when measurements were taken after 70 days of growth. Yield components, such as number, length, and diameter of stolon, petiole length, number of leaves per plant, and dry weight per leaf were closely related to each other. The leaf components of yield, dry weight per leaf and number of leaves per plant, had the highest direct and indirect effects on forage yields per plant among the yield components. This study showed nonadditive gene action primarily responsible for most <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> plant characteristics. Considering the ease of vegetative propagation in this species along with the self-incompatibility, mechanisms, it is suggested that parent geneotypes may be developed by some recurrent selection procedure, then crossed on a two clone synthetic basis to form experimental lines for testing purposes...|$|R
60|$|When I {{began my}} {{experiments}} I {{did not intend}} to raise crossed and self-fertilised plants for more than a single generation; {{but as soon as the}} plants of the first generation were in flower I thought that I would raise one more generation, and acted in the following manner. Several flowers on one or more of the self-fertilised plants were again self-fertilised; and several flowers on one or more of the crossed plants were fertilised with pollen from another crossed plant of the same lot. Having thus once begun, the same method was followed for as many as ten successive generations with some of the species. The <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>seedlings</b> were always treated in exactly the same manner as already described. The self-fertilised plants, whether originally descended from one or two mother-plants, were thus in each generation as closely interbred as was possible; and I could not have improved on my plan. But instead of crossing one of the crossed plants with another crossed plant, I ought to have crossed the self-fertilised plants of each generation with pollen taken from a non-related plant--that is, one belonging to a distinct family or stock of the same species and variety. This was done in several cases as an additional experiment, and gave very striking results. But the plan usually followed was to put into competition and compare intercrossed plants, which were almost always the offspring of more or less closely related plants, with the self-fertilised plants of each succeeding generation;--all having been grown under closely similar conditions. I have, however, learnt more by this method of proceeding, which was begun by an oversight and then necessarily followed, than if I had always crossed the self-fertilised plants of each succeeding generation with pollen from a fresh stock.|$|E
