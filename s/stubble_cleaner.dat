Results of a 2 -year grass-clover ley (2006 / 2007) and silage maize (2008) are presented. Due to dry conditions, mean grass-clover yields were 25 % higher in RT than in CT, indicating better water retention of RT soils. Clover cover and mineral contents of the fodder mixture were also higher in RT. The ley was successfully removed in autumn 2007 in RT plots, and a winter pea catch crop was sown before maize. In CT, ploughing took place in spring 2008. Maize yields were 34 % higher in RT than in CT, despite a two- to three-fold higher but still tolerable weed infestation. Maize in RT plots benefited from an additional 61. 5 kg of easily decomposable organic N/ha incorporated into the soil via the pea mulch. Measurement of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of maize roots indicated a similar mechanical disturbance of the topsoil through the reduced ley removal system compared with ploughing. It is suggested that RT is applicable in organic farming, even in arable-ley rotations, but long-term effects need further assessment...|$|E
40|$|The stubble {{cultivation}} {{cuts the}} dock roots below growth points. The vegetative plant parts are then {{cut off from}} the water and nutrient supply, and regrowth is inhibited. Practical recommendation •	Summer dock treatment is especially worthwhile in dry summers with catch crop cultivation and after early maturing crops (winter barley, whole-crop silage) or with an early tillage of grass-clover. •	After grass-clover lay or cereal harvest, undercut the dock plants at a depth of 12 - 15 cm with a skim plough (without skimmer) with a support wheel, a <b>stubble</b> <b>cleaner</b> or an overlapping flat cultivator. •	Bring the roots to the surface by passing over the field with a spring-tine harrow every 7 - 14 days. Additionally, apply a rotary harrow in heavy soils to expose the roots. •	After every round, collect roots manually or let them dry in suitable weather conditions. Only leave fully dead roots on the field. Information •	Plan deep-rooted crops and annual or perennial cover crops in the crop rotation {{in order to reduce the}} water and nutrient supply in deeper soil layers and thus impair the growth conditions for dock plants. •	After a short dock treatment sow a suitable catch crop as quickly as possible, and only leave the field fallow until autumn sowing of cereals, if you intend to perform a longer treatment. •	If the dock pressure is high, refrain from sowing 4 -year, slowly growing mixtures...|$|E
