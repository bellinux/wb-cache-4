This seemingly <b>simple</b> <b>act</b> of kindness stays with Yumi the rest of the day, and she speaks of her meeting with Sachiko to her friends during class and lunch.|$|E

Jim finds himself in a small town facing 20 captured Indian rebels. The captain who has arrested them says that if Jim will kill one, the others will be released in honour of Jim's status as a guest, but if he does not, they will all be killed. <b>Simple</b> <b>act</b> utilitarianism would favour Jim killing one of the men.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} class of {{independence}} axioms for <b>simple</b> <b>acts.</b> By introducing the E-cominimum independence axiom that is stronger than the comonotonic independence axiom but weaker than the independence axiom, we provide a new axiomatization theorem of <b>simple</b> <b>acts</b> {{within the framework of}} Choquet Expected Utility. Furthermore, in order to provide the axiomatization of <b>simple</b> <b>acts,</b> we generalize Kajii, Kojima, and Ui (2007, Journal of Mathematical Economics) into an infinite state space. Our axiomatization theorem relates Choquet Expected Utility to Multi-prior Expected Utility through the core of a capacity that is explicitly derived within our framework. Our result in this paper also derives Gilboa (1989, Econometrica), Eichberger and Kelsey (1999, Theory and Decision), and Rohde (2010, Social Choice and Welfare) as a corollary...|$|R

5|$|Into Temptation {{is also a}} {{story of}} {{redemption}}, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption {{for a life of}} sin and prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's <b>simple</b> <b>act</b> of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.|$|E

25|$|Bergson {{responds}} {{by saying}} that the antinomies are the result of analysis, not intuition. An example of this is Duration itself, which Bergson maintains isn’t a multiplicity or a unity. Depending on the viewpoint from which one begins, he will either reconstruct the absolute Duration as a unity or a multiplicity. Hence the antinomy of substance pluralism and substance monism, which can only be resolved through showing they are two representations of the same thing via a <b>simple</b> <b>act</b> of intuition. Thus real philosophy consists in placing oneself above the fray of oppositional schools of thought.|$|E

25|$|Volunteering has {{the ability}} {{to improve the quality of}} life and health of those who donate their time and {{research}} has found that older adults will benefit the most from volunteering. Physical and mental ailments plaguing older adults can be healed through the <b>simple</b> <b>act</b> of helping others; however, one must be performing the good deed from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent older adults from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the communities in which one serves, but also the life of the individual who is providing help to the community.|$|E
25|$|Pain and {{discomfort}} also increase aggression. Even the <b>simple</b> <b>act</b> of placing one's hands {{in hot water}} can cause an aggressive response. Hot temperatures have been implicated {{as a factor in}} a number of studies.

Students were found to be more aggressive and irritable after taking a test in a hot classroom (Anderson et al. 1996, Rule, et al. 1987). Drivers in cars without air conditioning were also found to be more likely to honk their horns (Kenrick & MacFarlane 1986), which is used as a measure of aggression and has shown links to other factors such as generic symbols of aggression or the visibility of other drivers.|$|E

2500|$|In a French {{television}} {{debate in}} 2003 with Nicolas Sarkozy, Sarkozy accused Ramadan of defending the stoning of adulterers, a punishment supposedly warranted by {{a section of}} the Islamic penal code known as hudud.

Many people, including Sarkozy, were outraged. Ramadan later defended his position arguing that, because it involved religious texts that Muslims take seriously, the law would have to be properly understood and contextualized. Ramadan argued that in Muslim countries, the <b>simple</b> <b>act</b> to [...] "condemn" [...] won't change anything, but with a moratorium, it could open the way for further debate.

[...] Also, [...] "A believer has to help keeping security, that of his nation and community, and protecting his religion."
