50|$|<b>Sulfadimethoxine,</b> {{like all}} sulfonamides, diffuses easily {{when it is}} in its unionized, lipid-soluble form, and easily reaches many tissues. The {{relative}} amounts are determined by both its pKa and by the pH of each tissue. Therefore, levels tend to be higher in less acidic tissue and body fluids or in diseased tissues having high concentrations of leucocytes. Its ability to bind to plasma proteins is very high, leading <b>sulfadimethoxine</b> to maintain higher blood levels than most other long-acting sulfonamides. Comparatively low doses can give rapid and sustained therapeutic blood levels. Most animals for which <b>sulfadimethoxine</b> is marketed acetylate <b>sulfadimethoxine</b> in the liver to form acetylsulfadimethoxine, which is secreted in the bile. Dogs are the exception - since they are unable acetylate sulfanamides, they excrete <b>sulfadimethoxine</b> mostly unchanged in the urine (their inability to transform <b>sulfadimethoxine</b> also makes them more susceptible to negative side effects).|$|E

50|$|<b>Sulfadimethoxine</b> (or sulphadimethoxine, {{trade names}} Di-Methox or Albon) is a {{long-lasting}} sulfonamide antimicrobial medication used in veterinary medicine. It {{is used to}} treat many infections, including respiratory, urinary tract, enteric, and soft tissue infections and can be given as a standalone or combined with ormetoprim to broaden the target range.

50|$|Cyanoacetic acid is a {{versatile}} intermediate {{in the preparation}} of chemicals. it is a precursor to synthetic caffeine via the intermediacy of theophylline.

50|$|Like other sulfonamides, <b>sulfadimethoxine</b> is a dihydropteroate synthase inhibitor. Bacteria {{and some}} {{protozoa}} {{are unable to}} obtain folic acid from the environment, and must instead synthesize it by converting PABA (para-aminobenzoate) to dihydropteroate using the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase. Sulfonamides act as a competitive inhibitor; being structurally similar to PABA, {{they are able to}} bind to the enzyme's active site and prevent the synthesis of folic acid from progressing. Folic acid is necessary for these organisms to produce nucleic acids (i.e. DNA and RNA), which are required for cell division. Thus, it has a microbiostatic effect rather than a microbiocidal one (it prevents pathogen growth rather than killing them), and has the strongest effect in the beginning stages of an infection, when the pathogen is rapidly dividing. Since it's microbiostatic, <b>sulfadimethoxine</b> still requires the animal to still be able to mount an immune response to kill the pathogen.|$|E

50|$|Mastitis, a {{potentially}} fatal inflammatory {{infection of the}} mammary glands, is a common health problem in dairy cows in the United States and causes great economic losses for the dairy industry each year due to reduced milk production in cows with mastitis. While the influence of contagious gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus) - {{which used to be}} the primary cause for mastitis in dairy cows - has been significantly reduced in recent years, environmental pathogens such as coliform bacteria (e.g. E. coli) and noncontagious Streptococcus now play a larger role in the infection of dairy cows. This is cause for concern as environmental bacteria, noncontagious Streptococcus especially, are becoming increasingly resistant to antimicrobial intramammary therapy. McCowan et al. (2005) set out to determine if certain housing facilities, husbandry practices, and/or use of antimicrobial agents caused higher levels of resistant environmental bacteria. The researchers sampled the bulk tank milk of nearly 100 California dairies and conducted a face-to-face on-site questionnaire for approximately 50 of the dairies found to have at least 3 environmental bacteria isolates. McCowan et al. (2005) analyzed the results and found that not drying udders before attaching the milk units significantly increased chances of antimicrobial resistance, as did the use of some antimicrobial agents (ceftiofur, <b>Sulfadimethoxine)</b> for treatment of non-mastitis diseases. Surprisingly, no antimicrobial agents used to treat mastitis were found to cause increased resistance.|$|E

In certain experiments sulfaethoxypyridazine was also included for comparison. Experimental results showed that the OMP diet required about one-half the amount of sulfamethazine as a fish-meat diet to attain an equivalent blood concentration. The addition of sodium bicarbonate did not influence the absorption rate or conclusively reduce the toxic complications. Reduced growth when observed was attributed to the reluctancy of the fish to eat the medicated diets. Diets medicated with sulfisoxazole were tolerated best followed by those containing sulfamethazine and <b>sulfadimethoxine</b> respectively. Sulfisoxazole showed growth stimulating properties when administered at 5 and 10 gm per 100 pounds of fish per day. Acute toxicity symptoms were not induced due to the refusal of fish to eat the more highly medicated diets, but deaths due to a secondary superficial growth of fungi was associated with the use of all drugs. Sulfisoxazole caused the least number of deaths when administered at 5 gm per 100 pounds of fish per day followed by <b>sulfadimethoxine</b> and sulfamethazine respectively. Peak blood concentrations were attained within 12 hours of the initial dose with sulfisoxazole and <b>sulfadimethoxine,</b> while two to four days were required with sulfamethazine under similar conditions. Sulfisoxazole was also eliminated most rapidly frorn the blood, followed by <b>sulfadimethoxine</b> and sulfamethazine. In Vitro sensitivity tests against isolates of "cold water" disease (Cytophaga psychrophila) and furunculosis (Aeromonas salmonicida) showed sulfisoxazole to be the most active and sulfamethazine the least. Sensitivity test performed with either autoclaved or filter sterilized media containing drugs gave comparable results. Treatment of furunculosis in five month old coho salmon (Oncorhyncus kisutch, Walbaum) in production trials indicated sulfamethazine gave adequate control when administered at 5 gm per 100 pounds of fish per day for ten days.

In this study, data were collected on antimicrobial use and resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (n= 562), isolated from intramammary infections and (sub) clinical mastitis cases on 89 dairy farms in 4 regions of Canada [Alberta, Ontario, Québec, and the Maritime Provinces (Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick) ]. Dairy producers were asked to deposit empty drug containers into specially provided receptacles, and antimicrobial drug use rate was calculated to quantify antimicrobial use. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the Sensititer bovine mastitis plate system (TREK Diagnostic Systems Inc., Cleveland, OH), containing antimicrobials commonly used for mastitis treatment and control. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to determine herd-level risk factors of penicillin, ampicillin, pirlimycin, penicillin-novobiocin combination, tetracycline and <b>sulfadimethoxine</b> resistance in Staph. aureus isolates. Intramammary administration of the penicillin-novobiocin combination for dry cow therapy was associated with penicillin and ampicillin resistance [odds ratio (OR) : 2. 17 and 3. 10, respectively]. Systemic administration of penicillin was associated with penicillin resistance (OR: 1. 63). Intramammary administration of pirlimycin for lactating cow mastitis treatment was associated with pirlimycin resistance as well (OR: 2. 07). Average herd parity was associated with ampicillin and tetracycline resistance (OR: 3. 88 and 0. 02, respectively). Average herd size was also associated with tetracycline resistance (OR: 1. 02).
