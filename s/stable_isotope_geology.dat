Relationships between the seasonal <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> data and Greenland and Icelandic temperatures as well as atmospheric flow are investigated for the past 150 - 200 years. The winter season <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> data are found to be influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and very closely related to SW Greenland temperatures. The linear correlation between the first principal component of the winter season <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> data and Greenland winter temperatures is 0. 71 for seasonally resolved data and 0. 83 for decadally filtered data. The summer season <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> data display higher correlations with Stykkisholmur summer temperatures and North Atlantic SST conditions than with SW Greenland temperatures. The linear correlation between Stykkisholmur summer temperatures and the first principal component of the summer season <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> data is 0. 56, increasing to 0. 66 for decadally filtered data. Winter season <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> data from ice core records that reach more than 1400 years back in time suggest that the warm period that began in the 1920 s raised southern Greenland temperatures to the same level as those that prevailed during the warmest intervals of the Medieval Warm Period some 900 - 1300 years ago. This observation is supported by a southern Greenland ice core borehole temperature inversion. As Greenland borehole temperature inversions are found to correspond better with winter <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> data than with summer or annual average <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> data it is suggested that a strong local Greenland temperature signal can be extracted from the winter <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> data even on centennial to millennial time scales...|$|R

50|$|Manganese {{also has}} three meta states. Manganese {{is part of}} the iron group of elements, which are thought to be {{synthesized}} in large stars shortly before the supernova explosion. 53Mn decays to 53Cr with a half-life of 3.7 million years. Because of its relatively short half-life, 53Mn is relatively rare, produced by cosmic rays impact on iron. Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in <b>isotope</b> <b>geology</b> and radiometric dating. Mn-Cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from 26Al and 107Pd for the early history of the solar system. Variations in 53Cr/52Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites suggest an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio, which indicates that Mn-Cr isotopic composition must result from in situ decay of 53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence, 53Mn provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system. The isotopes of manganese range in atomic weight from 46 u (46Mn) to 65 u (65Mn). The primary decay mode before the most abundant <b>stable</b> <b>isotope,</b> 55Mn, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay.|$|R

In addition to the study of trophic ecology, <b>stable</b> <b>isotopes</b> have been used to track the movement of seabirds across isotopic gradients, as individuals moving between isotopically distinct foodwebs can carry with them information on the location of previous feeding areas.

The {{purpose of this article is}} to show the different fields of {{application of}} <b>stable</b> <b>isotopes</b> to the study of the seabird ecology.

40|$|Biodegradation of {{contaminants}} {{is a common}} remediation strategy for subsurface environments. To monitor the success of such remediation means a quantitative assessment of biodegradation at the field scale is required. Nevertheless, the reliable quantification of the in situ biodegradation process {{it is still a}} major challenge. Compoundspecific <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> analysis has become an established method for the qualitative analysis of biodegradation in the field and this method is also proposed for a quantitative analysis. However, to use <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> data to obtain quantitative information on in situ biodegradation requires among others knowledge on the influence of mass transfer processes on the observed <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> fractionation.

30|$|One typical field-based {{method of}} {{estimating}} population size and identifying movement of fish is the mark–recapture method (Pine et al. 2003). However, mark–recapture methods require tagging individuals and can be labor intensive because several repeated sampling periods may be needed. Other approaches to investigate the movement of fish in aquatic ecosystems utilize carbon and nitrogen <b>stable</b> <b>isotopes</b> (δ 13 C and δ 15 N). <b>Stable</b> <b>isotope</b> measurements {{have been used to}} study fish migration between freshwater and estuarine habitats (Cunjak et al. 2005). <b>Stable</b> <b>isotopes</b> are especially useful as tracers of animal movement between habitats because δ 13 C can trace energy and carbon sources and δ 15 N can identify feeding relationships and trophic position (Vinagre et al. 2008). If a <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> approach can be shown to be as effective as mark–recapture methods at identifying movement and understanding fish life-history, then incorporating less field-intensive <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> approaches in future studies on fish movement in rice paddy field ecosystems would be desirable.|$|R

40|$|<b>Stable</b> <b>isotope</b> {{analysis}} (SIA) {{has become}} {{a powerful tool for}} ecotoxicologists to study dietary exposure and biomagnification of contaminants in wild animal populations. The use of SIA in ecotoxicology continues to expand and, while much more is known about the mechanisms driving patterns of isotopic ratios in consumers, there remain several considerations or sources of uncertainty that can influence interpretation of data from field studies. We outline current uses of SIA in ecotoxicology, including estimating the importance of dietary sources of carbon and their application in biomagnification studies, and we present six main considerations or sources of uncertainty associated with the approach: (1) unequal diet-tissue <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> fractionation among species, (2) variable diet-tissue <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> fractionation within a given species, (3) different <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> ratios in different tissues of the animal, (4) fluctuating baseline <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> ratios across systems, (5) the presence of true omnivores, and (6) movement of animals and nutrients between food webs. Since these considerations or sources of uncertainty are difficult to assess in field studies, we advocate that researchers consider the following in designing ecotoxicological research and interpreting results: assess and utilize variation in <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> diet-tissue fractionation among animal groups available in the literature; determine <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> ratios in multiple tissues to provide a temporal assessment of feeding; adequately characterize baseline isotope ratios; utilize stomach contents when possible; and assess and integrate life history of study animals in a system.
