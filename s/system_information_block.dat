40|$|Systematic block codes compute (n-k) parity bits for an <b>{{information}}</b> <b>block</b> of k bits, and append the parity bits {{to the end}} of {{the information}} bits to form an n-bit codeword. This redundancy provides certain ability for the receiver to detect or correct a limited number of errors caused by noise and interference on the channel. In direct sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS) communication <b>systems,</b> the <b>information</b> is spread over a large bandwidth by multiplying the information bits with a high rate pseudonoise (PN) sequence. In this thesis, these two techniques are combined to create a new technique, named parity bit selected direct sequence code division multiple access (parity bit selected DS-CDMA). The proposed scheme uses the (n-k) parity bits to select one of 2 (n-k) mutually orthogonal PN sequences. Then the selected PN sequence is used to spread each bit in the <b>information</b> <b>block</b> of k bits. But the (n-k) parity bits are not appended {{to the end of}} the information bits, and are not transmitted to the receiver. The receiver can obtain the parity bits by using 2 (n-k) matched filters to determine which PN sequence is used for an <b>information</b> <b>block</b> of k bits. Then the errors can be corrected by employing a decoding algorithm. Block codes with different lengths are considered in our simulation in order to find which one is best for the proposed scheme at a given Eb/No. The simulation results in a multi-user environment show that the proposed parity bit selected DS-CDMA system can provide better BER performance than both the uncoded DS-CDMA and the block coded DS-CDMA systems...|$|R

30|$|The idea of coded-cooperative {{diversity}} {{was first}} introduced in [9]. In order to achieve the coded-cooperative diversity, many distributed coding schemes {{have been reported in}} the literature such as the convolutional codes [10, 11], distributed space-time coding [12, 13], distributed low-density parity-check codes (D-LDPC) [14, 15] and distributed turbo codes (DTC) [16, 17] and more recently the polar codes [18, 19]. However, the BER performance of binary turbo and the LDPC codes largely depends on the <b>information</b> <b>block</b> size, the longer the better and vice versa, whereas for the short non-binary turbo and LDPC codes, reasonable performances under the iterative decoding are reported in [20, 21]. In many existing and emerging applications (such as device-to-device and sensor networks), it is possible to have scenarios, which may transmit small <b>information</b> <b>block</b> size. Thus, it provides one of the many motivations for our work to develop such a coded-cooperative scheme, which may be useful particularly for applications having small <b>information</b> <b>block</b> size and require low encoding and decoding complexity. For any communication system, there is and always will be a trade-off between the complexity and performance as suggested in [22].|$|R
