40|$|Abstract. The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify concrete contribution to the initial shear strength of reinforced concrete (RC) hollow columns under lateral loading. Seven large-scale RC rectangular hollow column specimens were tested under monotonic or cyclic lateral loads. The most important design parameter was column length-to-depth aspect ratio ranging between 1. 5 and 3. 0, and the other test variables included web area ratio, hollow section ratio, and loading history. The tests showed that the initial shear strength reduced in a linear pattern as the column aspect ratio increased, and one specimen tested under cyclic loading achieved approximately 83 % of the shear strength of the companion <b>specimen</b> <b>under</b> <b>monotonic</b> <b>loading.</b> Also, several pioneering shear models proposed around the world, all of which were mainly based on tests for columns with solid sections, were reviewed and compared with the test results of this study, for their possible applications to columns with hollow sections. After all, an empirical equation was proposed for concrete contribution to the initial shear strength of RC hollow columns based on fundamental mechanics and the test results...|$|E

The use of titanium alloys Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) has become more extensive in the aerospace field, especially for elevated temperature applications such as leading edges on hypersonic aircraft and the jet engine turbine blades. Such applications expose the MMC to highly variable mechanical and thermal loading and corrosive environments. The mechanical and thermal loading may introduce macrocracks, which may promote oxidation from the crack surfaces. Previous research has noted that even though the oxidation generally degrades the MMC, the oxidation from the crack surfaces may improve the crack growth resistance of the metal matrix. Titanium alloys are potential candidates for use in MMC. Therefore, a more thorough understanding of titanium alloys used as metal matrix in MMC is imperative. This research effort develops a numerical modeling procedure to simulate the oxidation propagating from the crack surfaces and evaluate the effect on the mechanical behavior. The numerical modeling is divided into two parts: the oxidation modeling and the fracture mechanics modeling. The oxidation of a pre-cracked specimen is modeled by modifying the Fickian diffusion problem in order to simulate the chemical reaction in the metal. Two different variants of a fixed grid finite element method for numerical simulation of oxidation are used. The first approach tracks down the oxidation front and splits the domain into metal and oxide subdomains. The second approach is based on reformulating the governing equation in both the oxide and matrix, resulting in a single, non-linear equation for the whole domain. Two different methods are also used in the fracture mechanics modeling to simulate the effect of stiffness change and the oxide volumetric expansion on the energy release rate. The first approach models the stress measure the energy release rate. The second approach measures the energy required to open the crack as the energy release rate. Establishing both the oxidation and mechanical models, the energy release rate of a pre-oxidized Ti- 15 - 3 compact <b>specimen</b> <b>under</b> <b>monotonic</b> <b>loading</b> is evaluated...|$|E

The effects of stirrup volume ratio, stirrup yield strength, and concrete strength on damage {{evolution of the}} stirrup-confined concrete were investigated. The experimental {{results showed that the}} strength and ductility of concrete are improved by appropriate arrangement of the stirrup confinement. Firstly, with the increase of the stirrup volume ratio, the damage evolution of concrete can be relatively restrained. Secondly, higher stirrup yield strength usually leads to larger confining pressures and slower damage evolution. In contrast, higher concrete strength leads to higher brittleness, which accelerates damage evolution. Based on the experimental data, a plastic strain expression is obtained through curve fitting, and a damage evolution equation for stirrup-confined concrete is proposed by introducing a confinement factor (C). The comparisons results demonstrated that the proposed damage evolution curve can accurately describe the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Concrete is a {{material}} whose performance {{is governed by}} the subtle interaction of its cohesive and frictional constituents. Since the theories of plasticity, damage mechanics, and fracture mechanics cannot, by themselves, capture both of these phenomena, a novel constitutive model is proposed which combines the theories of plasticity and damage mechanics in a multi-surface formulation. Synthesis of these two constitutive concepts describes not only the hardening/softening behavior of concrete under compressive loading, but also the decrease of material strength and stiffness under tension. The characteristics and behavior of the concrete model are presented through performance studies of <b>specimens</b> <b>under</b> <b>monotonic</b> and cyclic <b>loading</b> in tension, compression, and shear. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{numerical}} {{evaluation of}} the mechanical behaviour of quasi-brittle materials like rocks, concrete, ceramics etc. is difficult from the computational point of view due to complex highly nonlinear phenomena occurring in the fracture failure mechanism, and the material softening behaviour due to the cracking process usually leads to a strong mesh dependence. The use of reinforcing fibres is an efficient and economic method to enhance the mechanical behavior of such materials. For a quasi-brittle multiphase material, such as a fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC), several phenomena {{must be considered in}} the computational simulation, such as matrix cracking, fibre bridging effects, fibre debonding, fibre breaking and so on. Continuum mechanics approaches as well as micromechanical ones have been developed for the computational solution of such problems. In the present paper, the mechanical behaviour of fibre-reinforced materials is analysed by adopting both a new discontinuous-like FE approach and a lattice model. The main phenomena involved, such as crack formation and propagation, crack fibre bridging, fibre debonding, fibre breaking, etc., are taken into account and examined using the above two models. The basic assumptions and theoretical background of such approaches are outlined and, finally, some experimental data related to notched plain or fibre-reinforced concrete <b>specimens</b> <b>under</b> mixed-mode <b>monotonic</b> <b>loading</b> are analysed...|$|R

Strains of one notch root and strains of other notch are different under same bending load level and ratios of both strain value become 0. 36, 1. 38, 2. 12. Therefore, {{it is found that}} strain distribution from one notch root to other notch root do not become the inverse symmetrical distribution such as bending theory described in text book.

In particular, all the components of this structural system can be designed according to capacity design criteria, imposing collapse in the sheathing connections of the vertical shear wall.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{high strength}} concrete (HSC) under uniaxial cyclic compression load {{is extremely important}} to simulate the seismic effect. It is very helpful {{to the development of}} high rise building and future demand of HSC. The main problems of HSC are brittle and less ductile. Hence, this project focuses into the brittleness and ductility of HSC column subjected to uniaxial cyclic compression. Eighteen specimens with compressive strength of C 60, 100 mm in diameter and 200 mm in height were tested and analysed under uniaxial cyclic and <b>monotonic</b> compression <b>loads.</b> All the specimens were confined with 2 layers or 4 layers steel straps with pre-tensioning stress at 10 mm spacing between straps. The lateral pre-tensioning stresses for 2 -layer and 4 - layer confinement were fixed to 5 bars and 4 bars respectively. The results show that SSTT confinement enhances the strength, less brittle and more ductile compare to unconfined specimen. The compressive strength and ductility enhancement are up to 118. 5 % and 64. 5 % respectively. The envelope curve of confined HSC tested under uniaxial cyclic loading is almost coincides with the curve of identical <b>specimen</b> tested <b>under</b> uniaxial <b>monotonic</b> <b>load.</b> The graphs of plastic strain confined with 2 -layer and 4 -layer confinement show the different in gradient.

A total of eight reinforced concrete (RC) and concrete-filled FRP tube (CFFT) columns were constructed and tested until failure. All columns had 1900 -mm in height and 213 -mm in diameter. The test parameters were: (1) internal reinforcement type (steel, glass FRP (GFRP), or carbon FRP (CFRP) bars) and amount, (2) GFRP tube thicknesses, and (3) nature of axial loading type (i. e. monotonic and cyclic). The experimental results revealed that the CFFT columns reinforced with GFRP bars exhibited similar responses compared to their counterparts reinforced with steel bars with {{no significant difference in}} terms of ultimate axial strength and strain capacities. Providing the GFRP tubes of the CFFT columns significantly enhanced the strength and strain capacities and attributed to change the mode of failure from axially dominated material failure (for the control columns) to instability failure (for the CFFT columns). Furthermore, the envelop curve of the CFFT reinforced column tested under axial cyclic loading is almost identical to the axial stress-strain curve of the same <b>specimen</b> tested <b>under</b> axial <b>monotonic</b> <b>loading.</b> However, the ultimate axial and hoop rupture strain was slightly larger for the specimen subjected to axial cyclic loading.

The periodical operations of gas injection and extraction lead to cyclic loading {{on the walls and}} surrounding rocks of gas storages. To investigate the mechanical behaviors of different host rocks in bedded salt deposit, laboratory experiments were conducted on the samples of rock salt, thenardite, glauberite and gypsum.

Testing results show that, <b>under</b> <b>monotonic</b> <b>loading,</b> the uniaxial compressive stress (UCS) of glauberite is the largest (17. 3 MPa), while that of rock salt is the smallest (14. 0 MPa). The UCSs of thenardite and gypsum are 16. 3 and 14. 6 MPa, respectively. The maximum strain at the peak strength of rock salt (halite) is much greater than those of the other three rocks. The elastic moduli of halite, thenardite, glauberite and gypsum are 3. 0, 4. 2, 5. 1 and 6. 8 GPa, respectively. Under cyclic loading, the peak strengths of the rock specimens are deteriorated except for rock salt.
