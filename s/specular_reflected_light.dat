40|$|<b>Specular</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> techniques, {{including}} both s le wavelength and spectroscopic versions of ellip ometry and reflectometry, {{have been used}} for both etch and growth rate control. However, use ofthese techniques for process control on products has been lim-ited due to the problems inherent in the analysis of refected light from patterned structures. In this paper, we examine techniques for the quantitative analysis of data from both highly regular grating structures and from patterns with low local order. We find good quantitative agreement of vector diffraction theory to specular reflection data. We conclude that there is significant promise for the use of specular techniques for in situ monitoring of topography provided that computational speed issues can be improved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGold {{ruby glass}} and lustre {{ceramics}} are the almost unique examples of physical {{colors in the}} cultural heritage. The main physical effect at the origin of their color is the excitation of surface plasmon modes in metal nanoparticles. Moreover, in lustre, interference effects due a multilayer structure add a bright iridescence. The principle of plasmons is recalled in detail and applied to Gold ruby glass. The case of luster ceramics is treated in more detail due {{to the complexity of}} the effects involved: plasmon, scattering, interference between <b>specular</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> beams and also between scattered beams.

40|$|The use of {{a mobile}} phone for {{classification}} and quantification of liquid samples is described. The screen of the phone is used for controlled illumination and the front side camera for imaging. No additional optical equipment is needed. It is shown that there are {{different regions of the}} captured image containing different information about the sample. One region contains light that has been specular reflected at the air-liquid interface and one is dominated by light that has propagated through the liquid. The <b>specular</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> contains information about the refractive index of the liquid sample whereas the transmitted light contains information about color and absorption. It is found that the specular reflectance increases linearly with increasing refractive index, n, in the range 1. 33 less than n less than 1. 38, as expected from the Fresnel equations. A change of the refractive index of about 0. 004 refractive units can be detected. The transmitted light intensity is well described by the Beer-Lambert law over a large absorption range. Light from the two different areas of the image is used to analyze several types of liquid samples. It is shown that {{a combination of the two}} measurement modes improves the classification abilities of the mobile phone...|$|E
50|$|<b>Reflected</b> <b>light</b> can {{be divided}} into two sub-types, {{specular}} reflection and diffuse reflection. <b>Specular</b> reflection <b>reflects</b> all <b>light</b> which arrives from a given direction at the same angle, whereas diffuse reflection <b>reflects</b> that <b>light</b> in a broad range of directions. An example of the distinction between specular and diffuse reflection would be glossy and matte paints. Matte paints have almost exclusively diffuse reflection, while glossy paints have both specular and diffuse reflection. A surface built from a non-absorbing powder, such as plaster, can be a nearly perfect diffuser, whereas polished metallic objects can specularly <b>reflect</b> <b>light</b> very efficiently. The reflecting material of mirrors is usually aluminum or silver.|$|R
40|$|When <b>light</b> is <b>reflected</b> from object surface, its {{spectral}} characteristics will {{be affected}} by the surface's elemental composition, and its polarimetric characteristics will be governed by the surface's roughness and conductance. Polarimetric and multispectral imaging can provide complementary discriminative information in applications such as object separation. However, few methods have been proposed to fuse the information provided by polarimetric and multispectral imagery for better object separation results. Considering that the metal and dielectric materials, and the manmade objects and natural background have different polarimetric and multispectral features, in this paper we propose a simple yet powerful method for object separation by using the polarimetric and spectral characteristics of <b>specular</b> and diffuse <b>reflected</b> <b>light.</b> A polarimetric imagery fusion algorithm is first proposed based on the degree of linear polarization modulation to distinguish different objects. Then the spectral and polarimetric information, which can be extracted from the <b>specular</b> and diffuse <b>reflected</b> <b>light,</b> is fused by using the HSI color space mapping for more robust object separation. Experiments on real outdoor and indoor images are performed to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed scheme. Department of Computin...|$|R
40|$|Specular gloss is an {{important}} factor in the development and utilization of printable substrates. A common method of measuring specular gloss is to use a standard gloss meter, several of which have been developed over the years by various research firms. However, gloss meters provide only a single number index of specular reflectance. A micro‐goniophotometer has recently been developed in this laboratory for measuring the entire goniophotometric curve (BRDF) of <b>specular</b> <b>light</b> <b>reflected</b> from substrate samples. This provides significantly more information about gloss than is available from simple gloss meters. The micro‐goniophotometer was used in this project to explore the mechanism of specular reflection from a variety of coated and non‐coated papers. The results of the study indicated that some coated sheets <b>reflect</b> <b>specular</b> <b>light</b> not only form the first surface of the coating but also from the sub‐surface boundary between the coating and the paper. Analysis of the shapes of the BRDF curves was also carried out. The height/width ratio was found to be the major correlate with traditional gloss, and th...|$|R
30|$|Surface {{polishing}} of Islamic papers {{was executed}} to {{different levels of}} quality and shine [4, 7, 8] and occasionally, a polished surface is difficult to assess by appearance (sheen, or occasionally only sheen marks) or by touch. Polishing was assessed visually and the ref-collection was divided into ‘Polished’, ‘Unpolished’ and ‘Uncertain’ categories. Reflection of light from surfaces depends on surface roughness [29], which {{can be measured in}} a variety of ways. Thus, in addition to visual assessment, roughness and gloss measurements were carried out, the ratio between <b>specular</b> and diffusely <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> was determined, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used, in order to find an instrumental method to reduce the subjectivity of visual assessment.|$|R
30|$|YAG:Ce {{phosphor}} presents high {{absorption of}} blue light, which causes rapid attenuation of transmitted blue and small reduction of <b>reflected</b> blue <b>light</b> with increasing phosphor concentration. The constant {{trend of the}} <b>reflected</b> (<b>specular)</b> blue <b>light</b> gives {{an idea of the}} reflectivity of silicone/phosphor samples. <b>Reflected</b> yellow <b>light</b> increases quickly as phosphor concentration is augmented. This trend was also found by Liu et al. [9] and it is evidenced by the graphs represented in Figure  6. Transmitted yellow light increases as the phosphor concentration increase, (as the incident blue light encounters more phosphor particles that make light conversion) until it reaches a maximum at about 20 % concentration (in weight). At higher phosphor concentrations, transmitted yellow light decreases because an increase of the number of phosphor particles decreases the mean free path of the light (blue and converted) and obstructs its forward passage. Therefore, most of the converted light is backscattered while transmission of light drops. For 0.5  mm thick films, 15 - 20 % phosphor concentration samples showed the best balance between converted yellow light and non-converted blue light in both sphere R and sphere T: more concentrated samples avoid any blue light to be transmitted, while less concentrated samples (< 10 %) yield less converted light.|$|R

The above-mentioned issues were completely avoided when a well collimated, 1.5 mm diameter laser beam was used; this beam was small enough to avoid rays escaping from {{the edges of the}} sample (beam size was small compared to the sample port size). Moreover, Fresnel losses were completely avoided as the 1 inch aperture of the integrating sphere was closed with a mechanical piece that let the 1.5 mm beam pass through (through a 5 mm whole) and recovered the <b>reflected</b> <b>specular</b> <b>light</b> within the R sphere. This piece was covered with Spectraflect® material in order to provide a lambertian reflectance inside the sphere. The angle of incidence of the beam was slightly tilted from the normal incidence (approx. 3 °) by careful adjustment of the position of the source installed on a XYZ optical mount. When the beam passes through the 5 mm whole, it hits the sample slightly off-axis and the <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> encountered the aluminum piece that closed the 1 inch aperture of the sphere, getting trapped in the DIS system.|$|R
