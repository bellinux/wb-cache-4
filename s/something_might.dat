5|$|Toivonen's crash {{remains a}} mystery because it had no close witnesses. Although it was caught on tape by a spectator further down the stage, {{it proved to be}} {{impossible}} to determine the cause of the crash from the footage. No race marshalls were close to the scene to notice the black smoke and no-one at the race finish knew about the crash. Toivonen's team only started to fear <b>something</b> <b>might</b> have happened after he failed to arrive from the stage on schedule. The next rally crew through the stage then mentioned they had seen some black smoke. By the time the emergency vehicles arrived on the crash scene, they could only put down the flames, which had been fanned by breezes. Lancia engineers and technicians could not determine the cause of the crash because the remains of the car were so charred.|$|E
25|$|When Harry {{arrives at}} the Burrow in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Molly finds out about Fred and George's {{experimentation}} with dangerous sweets they were manufacturing and tells them off before leaving for the Quidditch World Cup; however, after the Dark Mark appears over the sky at the World Cup campsite, Molly is upset for yelling at Fred and George, worried that <b>something</b> <b>might</b> have happened to them after she treated them so horribly. Towards the climax of that book, Molly and Bill arrive at Hogwarts to see the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, acting as family guests to Harry. After the return of Voldemort, Dumbledore asks Molly and Bill to join the Order and fight in the impending Second War. Molly comforts Harry and, {{for the first time}} in his life, he has someone to be there for him, like a mother.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{received}} {{interest in}} January 2009 as Queens Park Rangers expressed their wishes {{to secure a}} loan deal. Sunderland manager Ricky Sbragia said [...] "There's been some interest in Liam from QPR, so <b>something</b> <b>might</b> happen there". The following day, Miller signed a permanent contract {{until the end of}} the season for an undisclosed fee. However, on 19 May 2009, just six months after joining, QPR released Miller along with five other players.|$|E

500|$|Mouton's 1982 season {{started with}} a big {{accident}} at the Monte Carlo Rally. On stage twelve {{in the small town}} Briançonnet in Provence, she missed a patch of ice and slid off the road, crashing into the stone wall of a large house at 110km/h (70mph). Mouton injured her knee while Pons suffered a concussion. She had been in third place, and had set the fastest time for the difficult Col de Turini mountain pass. The pair's injuries were not serious and Mouton went on to make her debut in the Swedish Rally. She was running third when she slid into a snow bank, and crashed into the Quattro of teammate Hannu Mikkola who had gone off at the same place. She eventually finished fifth. In Portugal, Mouton recorded 18 stage wins on her way to a clear victory ahead of Toyota's Per Eklund. She once admitted that to be competitive in the rally, she tried to think of the large crowds right {{by the side of the}} route as trees. At the Tour de Corse, she could not match the pace of the leaders and finished seventh. At the Acropolis Rally, Mouton won ahead of the Opel duo Walter Röhrl and Henri Toivonen, and closed to within 20 points of the championship leader Röhrl. The event was overshadowed by two serious accidents, one of which killed a spectator. Mouton had commented: [...] "I'm afraid that <b>something</b> <b>might</b> break in my car and I can no longer avoid hitting a spectator." ...|$|E
500|$|Kirkwood branded Mercedes [...] "a savvy, ballsy {{girl that}} can't say no and is unapologetic about it". Metcalfe has {{described}} Mercedes {{as someone who}} [...] "hates every woman in Hollyoaks" [...] except her own sisters, and as someone who talks too much and has a [...] "mouth like a foghorn". She {{went on to say}} that Mercedes [...] "always looks after her family and would never do anything to deliberately hurt them. Mercedes' heart is definitely in the right place". Metcalfe observed that Mercedes is [...] "completely mad" [...] and she [...] "just does whatever she feels like doing at the time. She doesn't exactly think things through". Metcalfe further explained that Mercedes did not [...] "consider consequences", which led her to unintentionally [...] "destroy everything". She elaborated on this, saying that Mercedes never has a happy ending [...] "because she can't. I don't think with Mercedes there is ever a happy ending. Just when <b>something</b> <b>might</b> go her way or something's going to go right for her, she destroys it". She said that her character is [...] "used to getting her own way" [...] so she thought that despite her actions, [...] "everything will turn out right in the end". She opined that Mercedes was at her best in this state, being [...] "minxy and destructive". Metcalfe described Mercedes in this way: [...] "Whatever she does that's bad, she manages to justify in her head. She doesn't have much self-worth and she knows what she's like". Metcalfe also expressed the hope that Mercedes could be happy [...] "free and single". She explained that Mercedes was unable to remain happy, saying: [...] "she has moments of happiness but ruins them herself". She went on to explain that due to Mercedes' first love having [...] "messed her up", Mercedes behaved [...] "the way she is where men are concerned". She further explained that Mercedes believed she could change but was disappointed when she could not. Metcalfe said, [...] "When she says that she's going to change, she actually means it; she just can't sustain it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Julie Myerson, setting her 2003 murder novel <b>Something</b> <b>Might</b> Happen in {{an unnamed}} Southwold, calls it [...] "a sleepy, {{slightly}} self-satisfied seaside town". The town isn't named, but Myerson stated that setting a {{murder in the}} car park did make her {{feel as if she}} [...] "was soiling something really good". She holidayed in the town as a child and remarked in an interview that while everything else in her life had changed, her mother and Southwold had remained the same. She still owns a second home in the town.|$|E

2500|$|... (Vote: Against): Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru {{spoke with}} anger and {{contempt}} for the way the UN vote had been lined up. He said the Zionists had tried to bribe India with millions {{and at the same}} time his sister, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, had received daily warnings that her life was in danger unless [...] "she voted right". [...] Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, Nehru’s sister, the Indian ambassador to the UN, occasionally hinted that <b>something</b> <b>might</b> change in favour of the Yishuv. But another Indian delegate said that India would vote for the Arab side, because of their large Moslem minority, although they knew that the Jews had a case.|$|E
2500|$|Morrissey has criticised {{people in}} the UK who are {{involved}} in the promotion of eating meat, notably Jamie Oliver and Clarissa Dickson Wright—the latter already targeted by some animal rights activists for her stance on fox hunting. In response, Dickson Wright stated: [...] "Morrissey is encouraging people to commit acts of violence and I am constantly aware that <b>something</b> <b>might</b> very well happen to me." [...] The Conservative MP David Davis criticised Morrissey's comments, saying that [...] "any incitement to violence is obviously wrong in a civilised society and should be investigated by the police". Morrissey has also criticised the British royal family for their involvement in fox hunting.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2006, 500 {{supporters}} including {{world champion}} boxers Koichi Wajima and Katsuo Tokashiki submitted {{letters to the}} Supreme Court asking for a retrial. [...] In March 2007, Norimichi Kumamoto, {{one of the three}} judges who had originally convicted Hakamada, came out in support of Hakamada's innocence. He stated that he had doubted the authenticity of the confession and believed Hakamada to be innocent. However, he had failed to persuade his two more senior colleagues, resulting in the split judgment for conviction. [...] He eventually resigned his position out of guilt for the conviction. The revelation came in spite of a strong tradition against revealing the discussions between judges, and it resulted in Kumamoto being highly criticized. [...] "I’m glad I spoke up," [...] he said. [...] "I wish I had said it earlier, and maybe <b>something</b> <b>might</b> have changed." [...] He tried to visit Hakamada in prison to apologize personally, but his request was denied.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 April 2008 the Daily Mail {{reported}} that Harman {{had decided to}} wear a kevlar-reinforced stab vest while touring her Peckham constituency under police guard. On 2 April The Guardian relayed information from the Metropolitan Police that [...] "the type of Met Vest she wore over her jacket protected her from knife attacks and bullets, and, for her at least, was optional". Harman compared the decision to wearing a hard hat while touring a building site, which led the BBC's John Humphrys to respond, during an interview for BBC Radio 4, [...] "You wear a hard hat on a building site because... there is the danger that <b>something</b> <b>might</b> drop on your head. You don't need to wear a bullet-proof vest {{on the streets of}} London, do you!" [...] Harman told the BBC that the neighbourhood police team she was with put on their stab vests and gave her one to wear as well.|$|E
2500|$|Economist and New York Times {{columnist}} Paul Krugman {{has argued}} that Republican and conservative strategies in opposing healthcare are based on spite: [...] "At this point, the guiding principle {{of one of our}} nation’s two great political parties is spite pure and simple. If Republicans think <b>something</b> <b>might</b> be good for the president, they’re against it – whether or not it’s good for America." [...] He argued that Republican opposition to Medicare savings proposed by the President is [...] "utterly at odds both with the party’s traditions and with what conservatives claim to believe. Think about just how bizarre it is for Republicans to position themselves as the defenders of unrestricted Medicare spending. First of all, the modern G.O.P. considers itself the party of Ronald Reagan – and Reagan was a fierce opponent of Medicare’s creation, warning that it would destroy American freedom. (Honest.) In the 1990s, Newt Gingrich tried to force drastic cuts in Medicare financing. And in recent years, Republicans have repeatedly decried the growth in entitlement spending – growth that is largely driven by rising health care costs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another incident, Cao Cao's saddle was chewed by rodents when it {{was kept}} in a store. The storekeepers feared for their lives because the laws were very harsh during those times of war, so they planned to tie {{themselves}} up and admit their mistake to Cao Cao {{in the hope of}} receiving a lenient punishment. Cao Chong told them, [...] "Wait for three days before reporting the incident." [...] He used a knife to cut holes in his clothes, making it seem as though they had been damaged by rats, and then pretended to look upset. When his father asked him, he replied, [...] "There is a saying that a person whose clothes have been chewed by rats will encounter ill luck. Now, as this has happened to me, I fear <b>something</b> <b>might</b> happen." [...] Cao Cao said, [...] "This is just a superstition. There's nothing to worry about." [...] When the storekeepers reported the saddle incident to Cao Cao three days later, Cao Cao laughed and said, [...] "My son's clothes were with him, yet they were still chewed by rats, so {{it is not surprising that}} my saddle in the store was also damaged." [...] He did not pursue the matter.|$|E

2500|$|The prince rents {{a room in}} the Ivolgin apartment, {{occupied}} by Ganya; Ganya's sister Varvara Ardalyonovna (Varya); his mother, Nina Alexandrovna; his teenage brother, Nikolai (Kolya); his father, General Ivolgin; and another lodger named Ferdyshchenko. There is much angst within Ganya's family about the proposed marriage, which is regarded, particularly by his mother and sister, as shameful. Just as a quarrel on the subject is reaching a peak of tension, Nastassya Filippovna herself arrives to pay a visit to her potential new family. Shocked and embarrassed, Ganya succeeds in introducing her, but when she bursts into a prolonged fit of laughter at the look on his face, his expression transforms into one of murderous hatred. The Prince, fearing <b>something</b> <b>might</b> happen, intervenes to calm him down, and Ganya's rage is diverted toward him in a violent gesture. Ganya recovers himself, but his extreme discomfort is not helped by the entrance of his father—a drunkard with a tendency to tell elaborate lies. Nastassya Filippovna flirtatiously encourages the General and then mocks him. Ganya's humiliation is compounded by the arrival of Rogozhin, accompanied by a rowdy crowd of drunks and rogues, Lebedyev among them. Rogozhin openly starts bidding for Nastassya Filippovna, ending with an offer of a hundred thousand rubles. With the scene assuming increasingly scandalous proportions, Varya angrily demands that someone remove the [...] "shameless woman". Ganya loses all control and violently seizes his sister's arm. Cheered on by Nastassya Filippovna, Varya spits in his face. He is about to strike her when the Prince again intervenes, and Ganya slaps him in the face with all his might. Everyone is deeply shocked, including Nastassya Filippovna, and she struggles to maintain her mocking aloofness as the others seek to comfort the Prince. Myshkin admonishes her and tells her it is not who she really is. She apologizes to Ganya's mother and leaves, telling Ganya to be sure to come to her birthday party that evening. Rogozhin and his retinue go off to raise the 100,000 rubles.|$|E
