5|$|Saari {{initially}} {{opened fire}} {{on a group of}} <b>students</b> <b>taking</b> a business studies exam, and entered at least one other classroom. According to the three students who were able to escape from the exam room (there were roughly 20 <b>students</b> <b>taking</b> the exam), Saari had approached his victims individually before shooting them. It was also said that he was revelling in the situation and was acting very aggressively. Saari encountered little resistance, and the massacre was concluded relatively quickly. He then covered the classroom in a flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, and set the room alight.|$|E

With the help of other college professors, the committee creates a large pool of possible questions that is pre-tested with college <b>students</b> <b>taking</b> statistics courses. The test is then refined to an appropriate level of difficulty and clarity. Afterwards, the Educational Testing Service is responsible for printing and administering the exam.|$|E

5|$|While {{attending}} Columbia, Beebe persuaded his {{professors to}} sponsor him and several fellow <b>students</b> <b>taking</b> research trips to Nova Scotia, where {{he continued his}} hobby of collecting, as well as attempting to photograph difficult-to-observe scenes of birds and other animals. Several of Beebe's photographs from these expeditions were purchased by Columbia professors to use as slides during their lectures. During these trips Beebe also developed an interest in dredging, the practice of using nets to haul up animals that lived deep underwater, and attempting to study them before they died or disintegrated. Beebe never applied to receive a degree from Columbia, although years later he was granted honorary doctorates from both Tufts and Colgate University.|$|E
5|$|Angus College, {{a further}} {{education}} college, has around 8,500 students, with 80% passing {{the course for}} which they enrol. There are around 1,700 full-time students with part-time students making {{up the majority of}} the student population. Arbroath is not a student town and there are no student residences in the town. The student population is made up solely of local students living within commuting distance of the college. Angus College offers courses up to Higher National Diploma (HND) level in a variety of trade related and academic disciplines from construction to Social Sciences, as well as a sizeable number of programs relating to computing, information technology and office administration. A large number of the student body are mature <b>students</b> <b>taking</b> evening classes related to computing, digital photography and various software packages.|$|E

5|$|The Restoration, {{along with}} {{a return to the}} pre-war Laudian church and the passing of the Act of Uniformity in 1662, posed few {{problems}} for the sympathetic and quickly reformed Brasenose; only one fellow left without agreeing. For some, nominal allegiance to the new regime was the order of the day, supported by a weary college. The Restoration period was one of disciplinary laxity across the university; Brasenose was no different, with some of its <b>students</b> <b>taking</b> part in riots. Yate was instituted as successor – and somewhat retrospectively as predecessor – to Greenwood; six of the thirteen fellows that had been expelled returned; other personnel in the college were replaced. The period saw a rejuvenation of teaching in the University as a whole and a new cache of new thinkers, including Brasenose's Petty.|$|E
5|$|The Advanced Placement {{program has}} offered {{students}} the opportunity to pursue college-level courses while in high school. Along with the Educational Testing Service, the College Board administered the first AP Statistics exam in May 1997. The course was first taught to students in the 1996-1997 academic year. Prior to that, the only mathematics courses offered in the AP program included AP Calculus AB and BC. Students who didn't have a strong background in college-level math, however, found the AP Calculus program inaccessible and sometimes declined to take a math course in their senior year. Since the number of students required to take statistics in college is almost as large as the number of students required to take calculus, the College Board decided to add an introductory statistics course to the AP program. Since the prerequisites for such a program doesn't require mathematical concepts beyond those typically taught in a second-year algebra course, the AP program's math offerings became accessible to a much wider audience of high school students. The AP Statistics program addressed a practical need as well, since the number of students enrolling in majors that use statistics has grown. A total of 7,667 students took the exam during the first administration, which is the highest number of students to take an AP exam in its first year. Since then, the number of <b>students</b> <b>taking</b> the exam rapidly grew to 98,033 in 2007, {{making it one of the}} 10 largest AP exams.|$|E

50|$|Homework is {{time the}} student spends {{applying}} the class material without {{supervision of the}} professor: this includes studying notes, supplementary reading, writing papers, or other unsupervised activities such as labwork or field work. Because students are generally expected to spend three hours outside class studying and doing homework for every hour spent in class, 15 SCH is the typical full course load, although many colleges consider 12 SCH a minimum full-time load for financial aid and other purposes. Some schools set a flat rate for full-time students, such that a <b>student</b> <b>taking</b> over 12 or 15 credit hours will pay the same amount as a <b>student</b> <b>taking</b> exactly 12 (or 15). A part-time <b>student</b> <b>taking</b> less than 12 hours pays per credit hour, on top of matriculation and student fees.|$|R
