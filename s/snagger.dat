They meet the mayor, Es Cade, who seems very bothered about the Cipher problem, but seems to do nothing about it. Later, upon leaving Phenac Colosseum, three Snagem grunts find Wes and Rui. The grunts then reveal to Rui that he was a member of Snagem, and an excellent <b>Snagger.</b> Wes then confronts one of the grunts, which results in the latter's defeat. Finding out that he is an expert at snagging Pokémon, Rui asks him to join forces with her in finding and snagging Shadow Pokémon.|$|E

In the spring of 2007, a questionnaire was administered to paddlefish <b>snaggers</b> using the Old Oar House Inn and Marina (private) or the Gordon Drake Memorial Harbor (public) at the Lake of the Ozarks near Warsaw, Missouri. This study examined the motivations of paddlefish <b>snaggers,</b> along with their activity involvement and place dependence scores in relation to distance traveled and fishing location. The questionnaire consisted of: 1) demographic, social and cultural factors; 2) trip characteristics, amount and type of harvest; and 3) paddlefish snagging philosophy. Consumptive motivations of paddlefish <b>snaggers</b> included, for the "experience and thrill of hooking one," to catch a really large fish," and "for the challenge of the sport. " Significant differences were found between <b>snaggers</b> who lived nearby and those farther away on activity involvement and place dependence. A significant difference was also found between <b>snaggers</b> using the private and public facilities using place dependence. Results from this questionnaire seem to indicate that paddlefish <b>snaggers</b> in Missouri were motivated primarily by consumption. Since the two snagging locations were close together, it appeared that place dependence was not based on the natural setting, but on the cultural resources (amenities at the private facility) ...|$|R

5000|$|After first {{casting a}} hook into the water, a <b>snagger</b> will wait until a fish sighted, {{at which time}} they will reel in the hook until it is {{positioned}} above the fish.

When fishing in a clear river, most snaggers will be able to observe their target's shadow or wake in the water to determine where their hooks need to be and when. To keep view of the hook, some snaggers use a brightly colored ribbon or cloth near the hook.|$|E

5000|$|Rutabaga {{has many}} {{national}} and regional names. Rutabaga is the common North American term for the plant. This comes from the old Swedish dialectal word rotabagge, from rot (root) + bagge (short, stumpy object; probably related to bag). In the U.S., the plant {{is also known as}} Swedish turnip or yellow turnip. The term swede is used instead of rutabaga in many Commonwealth Nations, including much of England, Australia, and New Zealand. The name turnip is also used in parts of Northern and Midland England, the West Country (particularly Cornwall), Ireland, Manitoba, Ontario and Atlantic Canada. In Wales, according to region it is variously known as maip, rwden, erfin, swedsen or swejen in Welsh [...] and as swede or turnip in English. In Scotland, it is known as turnip, and in Scots as tumshie or neep (from Old English næp, Latin napus). Some areas of south east Scotland, such as Berwickshire and Roxburghshire, still use the term baigie, possibly a derivative of the original Swedish rutabaga. The term turnip is also used for the white turnip (Brassica rapa ssp rapa). Some will also refer to both swede and (white) turnip as just turnip (this word is also derived from næp). In North-East England, turnips and swedes are colloquially called snadgers, <b>snaggers</b> (archaic) or narkies.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There {{has been}} {{considerable}} effort focused on developing efficient programs for tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Many {{of these programs}} do not account for potential reduced genomic coverage resulting from genotyping failures nor do they preferentially select SNPs based on functionality, which {{may be more likely}} to be biologically important. Results We have developed a user-friendly and efficient software program, <b>Snagger,</b> as an extension to the existing open-source software, Haploview, which uses pairwise r 2 linkage disequilibrium between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to select tagSNPs. <b>Snagger</b> distinguishes itself from existing SNP selection algorithms, including Tagger, by providing user options that allow for: (1) prioritization of tagSNPs based on certain characteristics, including platform-specific design scores, functionality (i. e., coding status), and chromosomal position, (2) efficient selection of SNPs across multiple populations, (3) selection of tagSNPs outside defined genomic regions to improve coverage and genotyping success, and (4) picking of surrogate tagSNPs that serve as backups for tagSNPs whose failure would result in a significant loss of data. Using HapMap genotype data from ten ENCODE regions and design scores for the Illumina platform, we show similar coverage and design score distribution and fewer total tagSNPs selected by <b>Snagger</b> compared to the web server Tagger. Conclusion <b>Snagger</b> improves upon current available tagSNP software packages by providing a means for researchers to select tagSNPs that reliably capture genetic variation across multiple populations while accounting for significant genotyping failure risk and prioritizing on SNP-specific characteristics. </p...|$|E
