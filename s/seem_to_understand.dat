A lot of people don’t <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that we can’t keep producing records if you keep not paying for them. Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give you as much support since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands will not get a chance to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E

25|$|Like Tristan {{the subject}} of Pelléas is a love {{triangle}} set in a vaguely Medieval world.

25|$|During the 2010 census 'The Cat Women of Gir Forest' counted {{more than}} 411 lions in the park, and 523 in 2015. The {{women who do}} the {{counting}} are of traditional Muslim tribes in neighboring villages. There are over 40 women van raksha sahayaks, who seek only to protect the animals of the park. These women {{have worked hard to}} win cooperation not just from local villagers but also from maaldharis, the semi-nomadic tribal herdsmen who live in the sanctuary. While tourist numbers are increasing people do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the phenomena taking place. The lions are almost tame in the presence of these female guards.|$|E
25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E

The vice president told the press he was anxious to discard the image he had earned as a partisan campaigner in 1968 and 1970, {{and wanted to be}} perceived as conciliatory. He defended Nixon on Watergate, and when McGovern alleged that the Nixon administration was the most corrupt in history, made a speech in South Dakota, describing McGovern as a [...] "desperate candidate who can't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that the American people don't want a philosophy of defeat and self-hate put upon them".|$|E

500|$|Palmetto Leaves {{became a}} best-seller for Stowe and was {{released}} in several editions. It was published again in 1968 as part of Bicentennial Floridiana, a series of original facsimile texts {{about the history of}} the state. It was so popular that through publishing it, Stowe virtually ruined the peace and quiet she sought in Mandarin to be able to work. The year following the publication of Palmetto Leaves, Stowe reported that 14,000 tourists had visited North Florida. Two years after its initial publication, a writer working for Harper's magazine noted that Stowe was [...] "besieged by hundreds of visitors, who do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that she is not an exhibition".|$|E
500|$|Syndicate {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. The game's story received mixed responses. The reviewer from GameTrailers called the plot predictable and considered {{several of the}} game's plot points boring. He praised the game's dialogue for its flow and the backstory presented. The reviewer said the campaign lacked scale but was nevertheless enjoyable and worthwhile playing. He also said the celebrity-led voice cast had successfully brought [...] "believability" [...] to the game. This was echoed by Jeff Gerstmann from Giant Bomb. In contrast, Martin Gaston from VideoGamer.com said he was disappointed with the campaign and considered {{it one of the}} game's biggest flaws. He said the world deserves more exploration than it had in Syndicate, and that the development team did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the creative vision of the first version of the game. He also said the emphasis on morals did not excel because it does not fit the game's overall style. He disliked the game's protagonist, who he thought was bland, making him difficult for players to relate to. Xav De Matos from Joystiq said the story is filled with promises but the overall product failed to differentiate itself from other shooters with similar themes. Dan Whitehead from Eurogamer compared it unfavourably to its predecessors and called it unambitious and uninspiring.|$|E

[...] He called local jury commissioners to explain the absence of African-Americans from Jackson County juries. When Leibowitz accused them of {{excluding}} black men from juries, they did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> his accusation. It was as if the exclusion was so ordinary as to be unconscious. (Note: Since most blacks could not vote after having been disenfranchised by the Alabama constitution, the local jury commissioners probably never thought about them as potential jurors, who were limited to voters.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Historian James J. Weingartner sees a {{connection}} between the American mutilation of Japanese war dead and the bombings. According to Weingartner both were partially the result of a dehumanization of the enemy. [...] "he widespread image of the Japanese as sub-human constituted an emotional context which provided another justification for decisions which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands." [...] On the second day after the bombing of Nagasaki, President Truman had stated: [...] "The only language they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> is the one we have been using to bombard them. When {{you have to deal with}} a beast you have to treat him like a beast. It is most regrettable but nevertheless true".|$|E
2500|$|In early 1986, both Jannetty and Michaels {{were signed}} by the American Wrestling Association (AWA) as they needed young talent to replace the wrestlers that had {{switched}} to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as it was expanding towards becoming a national company. The two were paired up by the AWA bookers; Greg Gagne (son of the owner {{and one of the}} bookers) suggested the name ”The Country Rockers”, another idea for a name was the [...] "U.S. Express" [...] (as told by Marty during an interview on AWA television that aired in 1986) not keen on the idea the two of them came up with the name The Midnight Rockers inspired by Judas Priest’s ”Living after Midnight”. AWA owner Verne Gagne did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the idea, (in fact he is quoted as wondering if fans might confuse the name with rocking chairs) but let the team go ahead and use the name.|$|E

2500|$|On March 17, 2008, The Toronto Star {{reported}} {{details from}} Canadians {{caught in the}} violent riots in Tibet. 19-year-old John Kenwood of Victoria, B.C. was witnessing a Chinese motorcyclist being pummelled unconscious by a Tibetan mob hurling chunks of pavement as big as bricks. [...] "He may have died," [...] Kenwood said last night (March 16). [...] "I can't be certain." [...] "He didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what was going on," [...] said Kenwood. [...] "He was wearing a gold helmet and he got off his bike and raised his arms. He didn't know what to do." [...] Also the report cited Canadian eye-witnesses of how the riots turned violent and how some of them escaped with help from taxi drivers and guides. Another report described in detail how Canadian traveller Justin Winfield from Toronto helped to save a Han Chinese from mobs {{and took him to}} a local hospital along with two women.|$|E
2500|$|According to Vikernes, the {{anonymous}} interview was planned {{by himself and}} Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal and get more customers for Helvete. At the time, Burzum was about to release the Aske mini-album. Vikernes said of the interview: [...] "I exaggerated a lot and when the journalist left we [...] had a good laugh, because he didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that I was pulling his leg". He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime. Vikernes claims that, after he was arrested, [...] "the journalist edited the interview and [...] published an insane version of it the following day, without even letting me read through it." [...] Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. Jørn Inge Tunsberg of Hades said that the interview had [...] "grave consequences" [...] {{for the rest of}} the scene and that they did not know he was going to talk to the press, as [...] "he had said nothing". He added that they became [...] "bloody angry" [...] and he, Tunsberg, was [...] "pissed off".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} scenes was the film's ending: Brian's crucifixion. Many Christian protesters said that it was mocking Jesus' suffering by turning it into a [...] "Jolly Boys Outing" [...] (such as when Mr Cheeky turns to Brian and says: [...] "See, not so bad once you're up!"), capped by Brian's fellow sufferers suddenly bursting into song. This is also reinforced by the fact that several characters throughout the film claim crucifixion is not as bad as it seems, such as when Brian asks his cellmate in prison what will happen to him, and he replies: [...] "Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion", and when Matthias, the old man who works with the PFJ, dismisses crucifixion as [...] "a doddle" [...] and says being stabbed would be worse. The director, Terry Jones, issued the following riposte to this criticism: [...] "Any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship seems to me a pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly." [...] Religious figures later responded by saying that Jones did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the meaning of the crucifix symbol or its significance to Christians as a reminder of the suffering and death Christ endured for their sake. The Pythons also argued that crucifixion was a standard form of execution in ancient times and not just one especially reserved for Jesus.|$|E
