5|$|Pelé {{arrived in}} Sweden sidelined by {{a knee injury}} but on his return from the {{treatment}} room, his colleagues <b>stood</b> <b>together</b> and insisted upon his selection. His first match was against the USSR in the third match {{of the first round}} of the 1958 FIFA World Cup, where he gave the assist to Vavá's second goal. He was the youngest player of that tournament, and at the time the youngest ever to play in the World Cup. Against France in the semifinal, Brazil was leading 2–1 at halftime, and then Pelé scored a hat-trick, becoming the youngest in World Cup history to do so.|$|E

The match was preheated with much excitement because of each country's political stance after the Iranian revolution; however, {{in an act of}} defiance against all forms of hatred or politics in sports, both sides presented one another with gifts and flowers and <b>stood</b> <b>together</b> for a photograph before the match kicked-off.|$|E

Tarrant and his son Louis <b>stood</b> <b>together</b> in the match between MCC and Southern Punjab, which provides one of the few instances when a father and son umpired in a match, and later also appeared together in a first-class match during the 1935–36 season.|$|E

There were also allegations that the Argylls had been guilty of widespread looting. The Argylls used the Chartered Bank building in the Crater as their headquarters and snipers stationed on its roof would shoot at anyone thought to represent a threat in the streets below. A BBC journalist wrote [...] "once we <b>stood</b> <b>together</b> in Crater watching the Argylls stacking, as in a butcher's shop, the bodies of four Arab militants they had just shot and Mad Mitch said: 'It was like shooting grouse, a brace here and a brace there'." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 16, 1991, {{the five}} {{original}} {{members of the}} Byrds put aside their differences to appear together at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. [...] The ceremony honored the original line-up of Roger McGuinn, Gene Clark, David Crosby, Chris Hillman, and Michael Clarke, while later configurations of the group featuring such key personnel as Gram Parsons and Clarence White were quietly passed over. [...] The occasion, which saw the band come together on stage to perform the songs [...] "Turn! Turn! Turn! (to Everything There Is a Season)", [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", and [...] "I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better", represented {{the first time that}} all five original Byrds had <b>stood</b> <b>together</b> since 1973. [...] Unfortunately, it would also represent the last time that the five original members were gathered together. [...] Clark died later that year of heart failure, and on December 19, 1993, Clarke succumbed to liver disease brought on by alcoholism.|$|E

500|$|Smith was by {{now in the}} {{twilight}} of his career, but his outspoken, confrontational stance continued to irritate the ZANU–PF government. He was declared a [...] "fifth columnist" [...] by the Information Minister Nathan Shamuyarira in February 1987 after he advised a group of South African businessmen that they could survive economic sanctions if white South Africans <b>stood</b> <b>together.</b> Three months later, after he was suspended from the Zimbabwean parliament for a year over his comments in South Africa and criticism of ZANU–PF, he resigned {{as leader of the}} CAZ. His four decades as an MP formally ended in September 1987 when, as allowed under the Lancaster House terms, ZANU–PF scrapped the white seats amid sweeping constitutional reforms. The office of Prime Minister was abolished in October; Mugabe became the country's first executive President two months later. Mugabe and Nkomo signed a unity accord at the same time merging ZAPU into ZANU–PF with the stated goal of a Marxist–Leninist one-party state.|$|E

The performance at the tour's final concert can be found on the video: Spice Girls Live at Wembley Stadium, filmed in London, on 20 September 1998. During the Return of the Spice Girls tour, [...] "Mama" [...] was performed as the second song from the show's fifth segment. All five girls <b>stood</b> <b>together</b> holding hands to perform it, while the LED screens in the background showed photos of their mothers holding baby pictures of the group, and a montage of them and their children. For the British shows, fifty young girls from the Capital Children's Choir dressed in white came out from a platform and lined the stage against the backdrop screens to sing with the Spice Girls. During some of the shows, the group brought their children onstage.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of his {{parliamentary}} term he made some proposals that were opposed by the entire parliament, including his own party. He proposed in November 1973 to introduce gun and shooting training as an optional course for students in high school, and to separate church and state (with its financial implications). The proposals were criticised in a press statement by Anders Lange and the party's two other MPs. Turmoil later also erupted in the Akershus and Bærum chapters of the party, and calls were made for expelling Gjems-Onstad due to his proposals in parliament; this wing however left the party in 1975 after being in clear minority. Gjems-Onstad and Lange nonetheless <b>stood</b> <b>together</b> in their conflict with Carl I. Hagen and Kristofer Almås, who sought to strengthen the party's deliberately loose organisation. After Lange's death in 1974, Gjems-Onstad became leader of the party's parliamentary group. While Hagen and Almås had broken out and formed the Reform Party earlier the same year, Gjems-Onstad welcomed Hagen back to the party in 1975 for [...] "constructive cooperation". He thereafter changed to support the work led by Hagen and Arve Lønnum of strengthening the party organisation.|$|E

500|$|With the {{scheduled}} {{transfer of power}} from Maga to Ahomadégbé on 7 May 1972, there were rumors throughout the country that the transfer would not occur (often rumored that troops loyal to Maga would march south and prevent the transfer). Maga had promoted many northerners through the civil service and military ranks {{and many of them}} saw Ahomadégbé as a threat to these new positions. However, all three members <b>stood</b> <b>together</b> for the ceremony and power was transferred from Maga to Ahomadégbé. Maga declared the Presidential Council to be [...] "one of the most beneficial institutions" [...] because it allowed the country to heal. The alliance between Maga and Ahomadégbé which had allowed Maga to govern the country quickly broke apart, and instead Maga and Apithy made an alliance which kept Maga's associates in their ministerial positions and prevented Ahomadégbé from effectively governing. The only major policy effort pushed by Ahomadégbé was the declaration to create a single political party from the various regional political parties which would be the only party allowed when the Presidential Council would end, although in practice the divisions between the parties largely remained. The tensions between the three members reportedly became their most tense with the planned visit of French President Georges Pompidou in November.|$|E
2500|$|The Synodical Conference split {{when the}} Ohio Synod left the Synodical Conference in 1881 {{over the issue}} of whether God predestined people {{according}} to his foreknowledge of whether they would come to faith. [...] The Ohio Synod had some pastors that allowed for this position, while the Missouri Synod declared it to be false doctrine. [...] This Election Controversy had been introduced by a German professor in the Norwegian Synod, Friedrich A. Schmidt. [...] The Norwegian Synod left the Synodical Conference in 1883, attempting to keep the disunity they experienced within their Synod from creeping into the Synodical Conference. [...] Meanwhile, the Wisconsin and Missouri Synods <b>stood</b> <b>together</b> in cooperation and harmony during this period of fierce debate.|$|E

The alliance was {{modeled after the}} Barcelona en Comú platform that won the 2015 Barcelona election, but it failed to garner the decisive support of the city's popular mayor Ada Colau and achieved a poor performance. Citizens (C's) benefited from its anti-independence stance and climbed to second place ahead of a declining Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC), which scored a new historical low for the third election in a row. The People's Party of Catalonia (PPC) suffered from its national counterpart decline and scored its worst result since 1992, whereas the left-wing Popular Unity Candidacy saw a strong performance which allowed it to {{hold the key to}} government formation with JxSí.|$|E

American veterans Hugh Thompson and Lawrence Colburn, who were shielding civilians during the massacre, addressed the crowd. Among the listeners was Phan Thi Nhanh, a 14-year-old girl {{at the time of the}} massacre. She was saved by Thompson and vividly remembered that tragic day, [...] "We don't say we forget. We just try not to think about the past, but in our hearts we keep a place to think about that". Colburn challenged Lieutenant Calley, [...] "...to face the women we faced today who asked the questions they asked, and look at the tears in their eyes and tell them why it happened". No American diplomats nor any other officials attended the meeting.|$|E
2500|$|Response of Jews {{towards the}} [...] "Judeo-Christian" [...] concept has been mixed. In the 1930s, [...] "In {{the face of}} {{worldwide}} antisemitic efforts to stigmatize and destroy Judaism, influential Christians and Jews in America labored to uphold it, pushing Judaism from the margins of American religious life towards its very center." [...] During World War II, Jewish chaplains worked with Catholic priests and Protestant ministers to promote goodwill, addressing servicemen who, [...] "in many cases had never seen, much less heard a Rabbi speak before." [...] At funerals for the unknown soldier, rabbis stood alongside the other chaplains and recited prayers in Hebrew. In a much publicized wartime tragedy, {{the sinking of the}} , the ship's multi-faith chaplains gave up their lifebelts to evacuating seamen and <b>stood</b> <b>together</b> [...] "arm in arm in prayer" [...] as the ship went down. A 1948 postage stamp commemorated their heroism with the words: [...] "interfaith in action." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{formation}} of the First Coalition saw Asquith display the political acuteness {{that seemed to have}} deserted him. But it came at a cost. This involved the sacrifice of two old political comrades: Churchill, who was blamed for the Dardanelles fiasco, and Haldane, who was wrongly accused in the press of pro-German sympathies. The Tories under Bonar Law made these removals a condition of entering government and, in sacking Haldane, who [...] "made no difficulty," [...] Asquith, committed [...] "the most uncharacteristic fault of (his) whole career". In a letter to Grey, Asquith wrote of Haldane; [...] "He is the oldest personal and political friend that I have in the world and, with him, you and I have <b>stood</b> <b>together</b> for the best part of 30 years." [...] But he was unable to express these sentiments directly to Haldane, who was greatly hurt. Asquith handled the allocation of offices more successfully, appointing Bonar Law to the relatively minor post of Colonial Secretary, taking responsibility for munitions from Kitchener and giving it, as a new ministry, to Lloyd George and placing Balfour at the Admiralty, in place of Churchill, who was demoted to the sinecure Cabinet post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Overall the Liberals held 12 Cabinet seats, including most of the important ones, while the Tories held 8. Despite this outcome, many Liberals were dismayed, the sacked Charles Hobhouse writing; [...] "The disintegration of the Liberal Party is complete. Ll.G. and his Tory friends will soon get rid of Asquith." [...] From a party, and a personal, perspective, the creation of the First Coalition was seen as a [...] "notable victory for (Asquith), if not for the allied cause". But Asquith's dismissive handling of Bonar Law also contributed to his own and his party's later destruction.|$|E
