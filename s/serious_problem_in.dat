5|$|Poaching is a <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> the country, {{particularly}} of elephants for the profitable ivory industry {{and a threat}} to lives of rangers even in the national parks such as Zakouma. Elephants are often massacred in herds {{in and around the}} parks by organized poaching. The problem is worsened {{by the fact that the}} parks are understaffed and that a number of wardens have been murdered by poachers.|$|E
5|$|Other than parasites and disease, {{predation}} is {{a threat}} to sheep and the profitability of sheep raising. Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. Even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic. However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a <b>serious</b> <b>problem.</b> <b>In</b> the United States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation. In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry. Worldwide, canids—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most sheep deaths. Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and feral hogs.|$|E
5|$|Blue whales may be wounded, {{sometimes}} fatally, after {{colliding with}} ocean vessels, {{as well as}} becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear. Ship strikes in particular have killed many blue whales in California. In September 2007, three dead blue whales washed up in southern California after being killed by ship strikes. Ship strikes are also a <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> Sri Lanka, and scientists believe this problem could be nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which {{makes it harder for}} them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Research on blue whales in the Southern California Bight has shown that mid-frequency sonar use interferes with foraging behavior, sometimes causing the whales to abandon their feeding. Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.|$|E

5|$|Overcrowding was a <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> {{many of the}} ad hoc {{secondary}} camps {{set up in the}} Saigon region, and led {{to public}} health issues. The Biên Hòa region on the northeastern outskirts of Saigon was scheduled to have a capacity of 100,000 refugees, but this was soon exceeded. In the Ho Nai camp near Bien Hoa, which was supposed to hold only 10,000 refugees, more than 41,000 were present by the end of 1954. The area surrounding Thủ Dầu Một north of the southern capital had initially been allocated a quota of 20,000 even though there was no rice paddies in the area. The area near Tây Ninh was to accommodate 30,000 people, although the locals thought that 100,000 could fit in. Some large Catholic settlements such as Thủ Đức, Bình Thạnh and Gò Vấp on the outskirts of Saigon have now been subsumed by urban sprawl and are now districts of the city. Because of the excessive number of inhabitants, the infrastructure at many camps could not cope and the promises made to the refugees were not kept. American military doctors travelled around the south in groups of three, and because of the paucity of health professionals, saw around 150–450 patients per day. They were also hampered by customs law, which only allowed charities to bring medicine into the country without taxation. This forced them to turn to charitable organisations as a conduit, creating another layer of bureaucracy. This was exacerbated by the fact that some corrupt Vietnamese officials pocketed the medical aid.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s the Saudi {{government}} began to slowly step up a public education campaign about AIDS-HIV. It started to recognize World AIDS Day, and the Arabic and English daily newspapers {{were permitted to}} run articles and opinions that expressed {{the need for more}} education about the disease and more compassion for those people infected. The number of people living in the kingdom who were infected was a closely guarded secret, as the official policy was often that the disease was not a <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> a kingdom because Saudis followed the principles of traditional Islamic morality.|$|E
25|$|The {{scarcity}} and unreliability of the French-built Hispano-Suiza 8B engine {{proved to}} be the most <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> the deployment and use of the Dolphin. Use of insufficiently hardened metal in the pinion gears led to numerous failures of the reduction gearing, particularly in engines built by the French firm Brasier. The engine also suffered persistent lubrication problems. Limited production capacity for the Hispano-Suiza engine and the priority afforded to French aircraft like the SPAD S.XIII slowed Dolphin deliveries. Availability of the Hispano-Suiza improved in early 1918 as the French firm Emile Mayen began deliveries on an order placed by the British Admiralty.|$|E
25|$|These {{were known}} as the Mk IB: Mk Is armed with eight Brownings were {{retrospectively}} called the Mk Ia. With the early cannon installation, jamming was a <b>serious</b> <b>problem.</b> <b>In</b> one engagement, {{only two of the}} 12 aircraft had been able to fire off all of their ammunition. Further cannon-armed Spitfires, with improvements to the cannon mounts, were later issued to 92 Squadron, but due to the limited magazine capacity it was eventually decided the best armament mix was two cannon and four machine guns (most of these were later converted to the first Mk VBs).|$|E

25|$|Long-term use and {{benzodiazepine}} dependence is a <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> the elderly. Failure {{to treat}} benzodiazepine dependence {{in the elderly}} can cause serious medical complications. The elderly have less cognitive reserve and are {{more sensitive to the}} short (e.g., in between dose withdrawal) and protracted withdrawal effects of benzodiazepines, as well as the side-effects both from short-term and long-term use. This can lead to excessive contact with their doctor. Research has found that withdrawing elderly people from benzodiazepines leads to a significant reduction in doctor visits per year, it is presumed, due to an elimination of drug side-effects and withdrawal effects.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, sales of the drug became {{increasingly}} regulated, as DEA regulators and pharmaceutical companies continued to fight for their respective positions. The DEA continued to make greater progress in their attempts to control pseudoephedrine as methamphetamine production skyrocketed, becoming a <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> the western United States. When purity dropped, so did {{the number of people in}} rehab and people admitted to emergency rooms with methamphetamine in their systems. However, this reduction in purity was usually short lived, as methamphetamine producers eventually found a way around the new regulations.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the Marxist-Leninist government in the country had a significant influence on the average Russian's economic ability to maintain his or her family. Because of the large population of bears in Russia and an increasing demand for bear parts, especially bile, poaching of bears became increasingly popular. Its main trade partners in bear parts are primarily nearby Asian countries like South Korea and the People's Republic of China. Poaching of the snow leopard is also a <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> Russia along with Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, People’s Republic of China, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The situation for antelopes has deteriorated significantly since the {{collapse of}} the Soviet system. There has been increase in poaching of the saiga antelope which reduced the saiga population in the country.|$|E
