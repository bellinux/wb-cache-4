40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{barriers and}} facilitators {{for improving the}} after-school organized physical activity (PA) and snack quality. Methods: After-school <b>staff</b> (<b>Year</b> 1, n = 20; Year 2, n = 17) participated in qualitative, semistructured interviews about the implementation of an after-school obesity prevention intervention. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded for common themes, and analyzed using NVivo software. Results: Several factors influencing implementation of PA and fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption were revealed. Facilitators for PA included: staff training, equipment/gym space, and scheduling organized PA. Physical activity barriers included prioritizing PA and lack of school administration support. Fruit and vegetable facilitators included requesting healthier snacks. Fruit and vegetable barriers included cost and low priority of snack. Conclusions and Implications: The success of improving after-school PA and FV snack quality is dependent on many factors, including several organizational system and staff variables. Future research should focus on systemic changes in the after-school environment to increase the priority of daily PA and a healthy snack...|$|E

40|$|Aim/Purpose: The uptake of {{university}} by regional students has been problematic for various reasons. This paper discusses a program, initiated by a South Australian regional university campus, aimed at attracting regional students into higher education. Background: A qualitative descriptive approach to study {{was used to}} determine the value of the program on participating students and school <b>staff.</b> <b>Year</b> 10 students from Roxby Downs, Port Augusta and Port Lincoln high schools were invited to participate in a two-day regionally-focussed school-university engagement program that linked students with the university campus and local employers. Methodology: A survey was administered to determine the impact of the program. Perceptions about the program by school staff were gathered using a modified One-Minute Harvard questionnaire. While 38 Year 10 students and 5 school staff members participated, 37 students and 3 staff evaluated the program. Findings: The findings revealed {{that the majority of the}} students would like to attend university, but financial and social issues were important barriers. The students learned about the regional university, what it can offer in terms of programs and support, and the employment prospect following university. The school staff benefited by developing a closer relationship with students and becoming better informed about the regional university. Recommendation for Practitioners: One way by which university uptake may be increased is to provide similar immersion programs featuring engagement with employers, our recommendation to other regional universities. In increasing the levels of education, individuals, communities and the society in general are benefited...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The English Church Census, 2005 followed-up from English Church Census, 1989 (available from the UKDA under SN 2842). The project surveyed each of the 37, 000 churches in England and the response rate was 50 percent. The main form was completed by someone in authority and provides key characteristics of the church, its leadership, the congregation (size and frequency of attendance, age, ethnicity), ethos ('churchmanship' or theology), midweek activities, community service and so on. A very brief, anonymous form was also given to each person attending on census day asking for gender, broad age category and frequency of attendance. The counts obtained from these slips were recorded for each church, but no individual-level data are held. The English Church Census, 2005 had a two-fold aim: {{to provide the best}} information available on the extent of religious activity by Christians in England to make progress in answering a number of important questions about contemporary religious practice Main Topics : The survey provides data on the following areas: church nature and organisation : denomination, number of <b>staff,</b> <b>year</b> started, characteristics of leadership attendance on weekend of 7 - 8 May 2005 : number of adults and children people (as measured for the congregation on 7 - 8 May 2005) : age, gender and ethnic distributions; estimated frequency of attendance; estimated number of weekly Bible readers ethos (church type) : e. g. broad, liberal, evangelical, radical, orthodox mid-week services/activities : attendance by age and gender church mission : number of Alpha courses and attendance; commitments to evangelism, preaching, community and youth work; support for third world aid, engagement in politics </ul...|$|E
