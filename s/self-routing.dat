So far, most of these studies {{have been based on}} invasive approaches. Nevertheless, a few researchers have decoded kinematic parameters of single hand in non-invasive ways such as magnetoencephalogram (MEG) and electroencephalogram (EEG). Regarding these EEG studies, center-out reaching tasks have been employed. Yet whether hand velocity can be decoded using EEG recorded during a <b>self-routed</b> drawing task is unclear. Methods Here we collected whole-scalp EEG data of five subjects during a sequential 4 -directional drawing task, and employed spatial filtering algorithms to extract the amplitude and power features of EEG in multiple frequency bands. From these features, we reconstructed hand movement velocity by Kalman filtering and a smoothing algorithm. Results The average Pearson correlation coefficients between the measured and the decoded velocities are 0. 37 for the horizontal dimension and 0. 24 for the vertical dimension. The channels on motor, posterior parietal and occipital areas are most involved for the decoding of hand velocity. By comparing the decoding performance of the features from different frequency bands, we found that not only slow potentials in 0. 1 - 4 Hz band but also oscillatory rhythms in 24 - 28 Hz band may carry the information of hand velocity.

40|$|Abstract—Inspired by {{the recent}} {{development}} of optical queueing theory, {{in this paper we}} study a class of multistage interconnection networks (MINs), called twister networks. Unlike the usual recursive constructions of MINs (either by two-stage expansion or by three-stage expansion), twister networks are constructed directly by a concatenation of bipartite networks. Moreover, the biadjacency matrices of these bipartite networks are sums of subsets of the powers of the circular shift matrix. Though MINs have been studied extensively in the literature, we show there are several distinct properties for twister networks, including routability and conditionally nonblocking properties. In particular, we show that a twister network satisfying (A 1) in the paper is routable, and packets can be <b>self-routed</b> through the twister network by using the C-transform developed in optical queueing theory. Moreover, we define an N-modulo distance and use it to show that a twister network satisfying (A 2) in the paper is conditionally nonblocking if the N-modulo distance between any two outputs is not greater than two times of the N-modulo distance between the corresponding two inputs. Such a conditionally nonblocking property allows us to show that a twister network with N inputs/outputs {{can be used as a}} p × p rotator and a p × p symmetric TDM switch for any 2 ≤ p ≤ N. As such, one can use a twister network as the switch fabric for a two-stage load balanced switch that is capable of providing incremental update of the number of linecards. I...|$|R
40|$|A unique all-optical 1 x 2 <b>self-routed</b> switch is introduced. This switch routes {{an optical}} packet from one input {{to one of}} two {{possible}} outputs. The header and payload are transmitted separately in the system, and the header bits are processed in parallel thus increasing the switching speed as well as reducing the amount of buffering required for the payload. A 1 x 2 switching operation is analysed and a switching ratio of up to 14 dB is obtained. The objective of the research was to investigate a unique all-optical switch. The switch works by processing the optical bits in a header packet which contains the destination address for a payload packet. After the destination address is processed the optical payload packet gets switched {{to one of two}} outputs depending on the result of the optical header processing. All-optical packet switching in the optical time domain was accomplished by making use of all-optical parallel processing of an optical packet header. This was demonstrated in experiments in which a three bit parallel processing all-optical switching node was designed, simulated and used to successfully demonstrate the concept. The measure of success that was used in the simulated experiments was the output switching ratio, which is the ratio between the peak optical power of a high bit at the first output and the peak optical power of a high bit at the second output. In all experimental results the worst case scenario was looked at, which means that if there was any discrepancy in the peak value of the output power then the measurement’s minimum/maximum value was used that resulted in a minimum value for the switching ratio. The research resulted in an optical processing technique which took an optical bit sequence and delivered a single output result which was then used to switch an optical payload packet. The packet switch node had two optical fibre inputs and two optical fibre outputs. The one input fibre carried the header packet and the other input fibre carried the payload packet. The aim was to switch the payload packet to one of the two output fibres depending on the bit sequence within the header packet. Also only one unique address (header bit sequence) caused the payload packet to exit via one of the outputs and all the other possible addresses caused the payload packet to exit via the other output. The physical configuration of the all-optical switches in the parallel processing structure of the switching node determined for which unique address the payload packet would exit via a different output than when the address was any of the other possible combinations of sequences. Only three Gaussian shaped bits were used in the header packet at a data rate of 10 Gbps and three Gaussian shaped bits in the payload packet at a data rate of 40 Gbps, but in theory more bits can be used in the payload packet at a decreased bit length to increase throughput. More bits can also be used in the header packet {{to increase the number of}} addresses that can be reached. In the simulated experiments it was found that the payload packet would under most circumstances exit both outputs, and at one output it would be much larger than at the other output (where it was normally found to be suppressed when compared to the other output’s optical power). The biggest advantage of this method of packet-switching is that it occurs all-optically, meaning that there is no optical to electronic back to optical conversions taking place in order to do header processing. All of the header processing is done optically. One of the disadvantages is that the current proposed structure of the all-optical switching node uses a Cross-Gain Modulator (XGM) switch which is rather expensive because of the Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA). In this method of packet-switching the length of the payload packet cannot exceed the length of one bit of the header packet. This is because the header processing output is only one header bit length long and this output is used to switch the payload packet. Thus any section of the payload packet that is outside this header processing output window will not be switched correctlyDissertation (MEng (Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

The well-known BeneS and Waksman permutation networks can be constructed with an asymptotically minimum number of switches, but the best routing algorithms for such networks need O ((Ig 4 n/lg Ig n)) time on an n Ig n-processor computer. Other networks {{that can be used}} for permutation switching are Batcher’s sorting networks and Koppelman and Oruq’s <b>self-routing</b> permutation network, but these networks require O(nlgz n) switches and O(lg 2 n) routing time. Using a new composite interconnection network model, this paper presents a <b>self-routing</b> permutation network with O(n Ign) switches and O(Ig 2 n) routing time. More generally, it describes a permutation network with O(kn’+’’k) cost and O(k Ign) routing time for any k; 1 5 k 5 Ig n. This improves Nassimi and Sahni’s routing algorithm that gives O(klg 3 n) routing time for the same cost expression. The only networks capable of permutation switching with O(nIgn) cost and O(lgn) routing time are the AKS sorting network and Upfal’s packet routing network, but the constants hidden in the complexities of these networks are so large that they remain impractical until n gets very large.
