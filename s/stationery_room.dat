500|$|When Barton first {{arrives at}} the Hotel Earle, he is asked by the {{friendly}} bellhop Chet (Steve Buscemi) if he is [...] "a trans or a res"– [...] transient or resident. Barton explains that he isn't sure but will be staying [...] "indefinitely". The dichotomy between permanent inhabitants and guests reappears several times, notably in the hotel's motto, [...] "A day or a lifetime", which Barton notices on the <b>room's</b> <b>stationery.</b> This idea returns {{at the end of}} the movie, when Charlie describes Barton as [...] "a tourist with a typewriter". His ability to leave the Earle (while Charlie remains) is presented by critic Erica Rowell as evidence that Barton's story represents the process of writing itself. Barton, she says, represents an author who is able to leave a story, while characters like Charlie cannot.|$|R
