40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{algorithm}} {{for the task}} of <b>supervised</b> discriminative <b>distance</b> <b>learning</b> by nonlinearly embedding vectors into a low dimensional Euclidean space. We work in the challenging setting where supervision is with constraints on similar and dissimilar pairs while training. The proposed method is derived by an approximate kernelization of a linear Mahalanobis-like <b>distance</b> metric <b>learning</b> algorithm and {{can also be seen}} as a kernel neural network. The number of model parameters and test time evaluation complexity of the proposed method are O(dD) where D is the dimensionality of the input features and d is the dimension of the projection space - this is in contrast to the usual kernelization methods as, unlike them, the complexity does not scale linearly with the number of training examples. We propose a stochastic gradient based learning algorithm which makes the method scalable (w. r. t. the number of training examples), while being nonlinear. We train the method with up to half a million training pairs of 4096 dimensional CNN features. We give empirical comparisons with relevant baselines on seven challenging datasets for the task of low dimensional semantic category based image retrieval. Comment: ICCV 2015 preprin...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} feature spaces for local image {{descriptors}} {{is an important}} research subject in computer vision due to its applicability in several problems, such as visual classification and image matching. In order to be useful, these descriptors have to present a good trade off between discriminating power and robustness to typical image deformations. The feature spaces of the most useful local descriptors have been manually designed based on the goal above, but this design often limits {{the use of these}} descriptors for some specific matching and visual classification problems. Alternatively, there has been a growing interest in producing feature spaces by an automatic combination of manually designed feature spaces, or by an automatic selection of feature spaces and spatial pooling methods, or by the use of <b>distance</b> metric <b>learning</b> methods. While most of these approaches are usually applied to specific matching or classification problems, where test classes are the same as training classes, a few works aim at the general feature transform problem where the training classes are different from the test classes. The hope in the latter works is the automatic design of a universal feature space for local descriptor matching, which is the topic of our work. In this paper, we propose a new incremental method for learning automatically feature spaces for local descriptors. The method is based on an ensemble of non-linear feature extractors trained in relatively small and random classification problems with <b>supervised</b> <b>distance</b> metric <b>learning</b> techniques. Results on two widely used public databases show that our technique produces competitive results in the field. Gustavo Carneir...|$|R
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{problems}} of uneven distribution of reality fault samples and dimension reduction effect of locally linear embedding (LLE) algorithm which is easily affected by neighboring points, an improved local linear embedding algorithm of homogenization distance (HLLE) is developed. The method makes the overall distribution of sample points tend to be homogenization and reduces the influence of neighboring points using homogenization distance instead of the traditional Euclidean distance. It is helpful to choose effective neighboring points to construct weight matrix for dimension reduction. Because the fault recognition performance improvement of HLLE is limited and unstable, the paper further proposes a new local linear embedding algorithm of supervision and homogenization distance (SHLLE) by adding the supervised learning mechanism. On the basis of homogenization <b>distance,</b> <b>supervised</b> <b>learning</b> increases the category information of sample points so that the same category of sample points will be gathered and the heterogeneous category of sample points will be scattered. It effectively improves the performance of fault diagnosis and maintains stability at the same time.

The study utilized a mixed methods approach and employed a single military war college, located in New England, as the research site. ^ One question guided this study: To what extent and in what manner do selected personal and institutional factors relate to student participation levels in <b>distance</b> <b>learning</b> at a military war college? ^ Data collection techniques included a mailed questionnaire to <b>distance</b> <b>learning</b> students (n = 200), in-depth interviews with all the <b>distance</b> <b>learning</b> administrators (N = 5), and focus groups with <b>distance</b> <b>learning</b> users (n = 15). ^ Questionnaire data, returned by 112 students (return rate = 56 %), were grouped into five independent variables: demographics, personal experiences with distance technology, attitudes toward <b>distance</b> <b>learning,</b> perceptions of what motivates participation in <b>distance</b> <b>learning,</b> and perceptions about institutional support for <b>distance</b> <b>learning.</b> The dependent variable was student participation levels in <b>distance</b> <b>learning</b> (the total of past, current, and anticipated <b>distance</b> <b>learning</b> courses taken). Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percents, means, and standard deviations) were computed for each variable. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the magnitude of the relationship between participation in <b>distance</b> <b>learning</b> and the independent variables. The cluster of questions on attitudes toward <b>distance</b> <b>learning</b> was significantly related to student participation, but the other factors showed no significant relationship.

(2) Military war college administrators should continually evaluate their <b>distance</b> <b>learning</b> programs to identify areas for improvement.
