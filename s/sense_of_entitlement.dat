25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Walter and Beneatha's father has recently died, and Mama is waiting for a life insurance check for $10,000. Walter has a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol and Beneatha has to remind him it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually Mama puts some of the money down on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the practical reason that it happens to be much cheaper. Later she relents and gives {{the rest of the money}} to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter passes the money on to Willy's naive sidekick Bobo, who gives it to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena says that while money was something they try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as them.|$|E

The love of power, Russell tells us, is probably not motivated by Freudian complexes, (i.e., resentment of one's father, lust for one's mother, drives towards Eros and Thanatos (Love and Death drives, which constitute the basis of all human drives, etc.,) but rather by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> which arises from exceptional and deep-rooted self-confidence.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explain puzzling {{differences}} in indigenous notions {{of citizenship and}} political participation in very similar regions of neighboring Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire. Based on original survey research and in-depth interviews at the village level, I show how the boundaries of political community are contested and redrawn {{at the local level}} in different ways in the two cases. In the Ghanaian region, village residents described a more community-oriented notion of reciprocity with the local government, while in the Ivoirian region, respondents expressed a more individually-oriented <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlements</b> from the central state. I argue that this variation in the nature of citizenship and the everyday practice of politics is shaped not only directly by the formal institutions of the state over time, but also indirectly through the changing informal institutions of reciprocity. The paper concludes by considering the implications of these regional differences for the long-term sustainability of democracy at the national-level in both countries. In Ghana, local politics are more salient, and conflict is resolved at the grassroots whereas in Côte d’Ivoire, political claims are exercised through a more vertical and national clientelist system, projecting conflict upward to the national capital. Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of informal institutions in the study of sustainable democracy...|$|R

However, gender-related status manipulation has no impact on men's elevated wage entitlement. Even when men's status is lowered on a specific task (e.g., by telling them that women typically outperform men on this task), men do not reduce their self-pay and respond with elevated projections of their own competence. The usual pattern whereby men assign themselves more pay than women for comparable work might explain why men tend to initiate negotiations more than women.|$|R

Psychoanalytic psychotherapy may be effective in treating NPD, but therapists must recognize the patient's traits and use caution in tearing down narcissistic defenses too quickly.

This chapter highlights the varying <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> to ‘figure’ the landscape of the Australian continent as expressed by a range of contemporary artists. The ongoing legacy of colonial invasion forms the backdrop to an examination of the ‘cultural awkwardness’ demonstrated by the descendents of white settlers that led, in the last 20 years to a retreat into ‘non-territorial’ digital abstractions of landscape. This contrasts with indigenous Australians’ growing confidence in the appropriation of film and video as legal artefacts in the ongoing struggle to establish their land rights. Indigeneity is itself a contested term in Australia and this chapter considers a revival of interest among all native-born Australians in Wolfgang Stechow’s contention that “nature redeems all”. The author asks, are we witnessing a return to a ‘re-particularised’ imaging of landscape among non-Aboriginal artists such as Sean Gladwell and Lyndal Jones, and how does this relate to Aboriginal appropriation of ‘white’ Australian cultural forms in the work of artists such as Vernon Ah Kee? Elwes argues that the totality of this body of work represent a new, truly post-colonial state of landscape film and video that embraces Jones’ optimistic view of the land that “we are all simply part of it”...|$|R

[...] A natural-born sorceress and a cunning strategist, Jadis is arrogant and cruel, considering herself above all rules and viewing others as tools to be used or obstacles to be demolished. After she eats the Fruit of Everlasting Life, selfishly and against the written admonition on the gate, she discovers that her sense of inner power and life is amplified. However her skin becomes as white as paper, symbolizing a kind of living death and the despair-to-come that is predicted in the text she deems she is above. Her callousness and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is most clearly demonstrated when she uses the Deplorable Word in Charn to vanquish her sister, even though the Word would eradicate all life in that world but her own. She prefers to destroy that entire world than submit to her sister's authority, and shows afterward a remorseless pride in her actions. Though her magic disappears when she leaves Charn, she manages to build it up again in Narnia's world, exercising both her previous experience and her privilege to witness a new world's dawning, to become again a sorceress of formidable power.|$|E

Stephen Gill, in a study of the style of the 1802 poems, argued in 1989 that the poems were new and broad in range with the ode containing [...] "impassioned sublimity". He later compared the ode with Wordsworth's [...] "Ode to Duty" [...] to declare that [...] "The Ode: Intimations, by contrast, rich in phrases that have entered the language and provided titles for other people's books, is Wordsworth's greatest achievement in rhythm and cadence. Together with Tintern Abbey it has always commanded attention as Wordsworth's strongest meditative poem and Wordsworth indicated his assessment of it by ensuring through the layout and printing of his volumes that the Ode stood apart." [...] In 1986, Marjorie Levinson searched for a political basis in many of Wordsworth's poems and argued that the ode, along with [...] "Michael", Peele Castle, and Tintern Abbey, are [...] "incontestably among the poet's greatest works". Susan Wolfson, in the same year, claimed that [...] "the force of the last lines arises from the way the language in which the poet expresses a resolution of grief at the same time renders a metaphor that implies that grief has not been resolved so much as repressed and buried. And this ambiguity involves another, for Wordsworth makes it impossible to decide whether the tension between resolution and repression... is his indirect confession of a failure to achieve transcendence or a knowing evasion of an imperative to do so." [...] After performing a Freudian-based analysis of the ode, William Galperin, in 1989, argues that [...] "Criticism, in short, cannot accept responsibility for The Excursions failings any more than it is likely to attribute the success of the 'Intimations Ode' to the satisfaction it offers in seeing a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlement,</b> or self-worth, defended rather than challenged." ...|$|E

Drawing {{on psychological}} theory, moral sensitivity {{is defined as}} the ability to express and show moral consideration in terms of empathy, role-taking and pro-social moral reasoning. Twenty-five preadolescent children aged 9 to 11, all living in Belgium, were asked in focus group interviews to share their reflections about and experiences with self-disclosure and privacy in internet environments. The findings demonstrate that young children are capable of imagining the moral consequences of disclosing personal information about oneself and about others. Their moral reflections are embedded in a more general concern of children's vulnerability to other, more powerful information circulators in their social networks, such as older children, siblings, but also parents or the internet crowd. A strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> children's <b>entitlements</b> to online privacy is articulated.

Of particular interest is the difference between a 'donor' and a 'fathe'' for the men, and the extent of their complicity with patriarchal discourses about fatherhood. I argue that, on one level, it is important to distinguish between patriarchal concepts of relatedness that connote entitlement to authority, proprietoriality or legal rights over children, and the various other dimensions of affinity men revealed, including that predicated on biological relatedness. Men's stories often indicated a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> connection to children in the absence <b>of</b> a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> parental <b>entitlement.</b> I also explore some slippage between 'proprietorial' and 'connected' concepts of relatedness which potentially have negative as well as positive implications for relationships with children growing up in lesbian-parented families and their mothers...|$|R
