Perhaps the most socialistic endeavor of the US is its K- 12 public school system; in fact, US public <b>schools</b> are necessary <b>for</b> <b>democracy</b> to thrive and to create an educated and well-informed populace.

40|$|Abstract—This study {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} foreign aid, levels of <b>schooling</b> and <b>democracy</b> <b>for</b> Pakistan using the ARDL cointegration approach. The results of study provide strong evidence for fairly robust long run as well as short run relationships among these variables for the period 1973 - 2008. The results state that foreign aid and primary school enrollments have negative impact on democracy index and high school enrollments have positive impact on democracy index in Pakistan. The study suggests for promotion of education levels and relies on local resources instead of foreign aid for a good quality of political institutions in Pakistan...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>school</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>for</b> civic education among students in {{primary and secondary}} schools. In Swedish schools, thereare two kinds of student governed institutions, the class council and the school council, designed to promote student influence on education and development of tools for participating in deliberative discussions as future democratic citizens. In the present article, this double function is problematized and factors relevant to its accomplishment are discussed. There {{seems to be a}} paradoxical relation between the fostering goals and the ambition of providing the students with more influence and autonomy. The article concludes that this paradox might be resolved by meta-communication about the problems and by involving the students more in planning and discussions about their education...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{empirical}} {{study of a}} voluntary association {{with a view to}} interrogate the theories of civil society and participation and their practice. These theories came to dominate debate on African politics and democratisation following disappointment with structural approaches to development and democracy. Disenchantment with the state whose role was emphasised by the structural approach led analysts and technocrats to turn their attention to human agency; hence the salience of the idea of popular participation in the public domain, and preoccupation with the idea of strengthening civil society. This trend gained momentum after the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and demise of the communist block, and was accompanied by anti-statist sentiments on a global scale. Civil society organisations are seen as <b>schools</b> <b>for</b> <b>democracy</b> and agents of democratic consolidation, and are accordingly expected to perform two major tasks, namely instilling and disseminating a democratic political culture in and among participants and society at large, and promoting good governance. The aim therefore is {{to take advantage of the}} supposed intrinsic and utilitarian benefits of participation. As evident in a number of policy documents and legislation, the incumbent South African government embraces the idea of participatory democracy. However, not all analysts share this confidence in the capacity of civil society to perform these tasks. For some analysts public participation does not always have positive intrinsic benefits. Public participation may instead lead to a corrupted political culture deriving from the participants' attempts to survive in a public sphere characterised by manipulation and subtle political control, and it is civil society organisations lacking in organisational strength that are particularly vulnerable. The study revealed that unity between practice and theories of participation and civil society is a complex matter fraught with a number of ambiguities and contradictions. It revealed that though participation in the voluntary association in question does have educative benefits, those benefits do not extend to all the participants. In addition, the quality of that education is contingent upon a number of factors, some internal, others external. The internal and external factors reinforce one another. The internal factors pertain to the organisational dynamics of the voluntary association itself, and the external factors to the nature of the relationship between the voluntary association concerned and public authorities and other civil society organisations.

40|$|INTRODUCTION ‘Sport for all’ is the {{official}} slogan of Danish sport policy. This responsibility has traditionally been shared between the two major national umbrella sport governing bodies: the NOC and Sports Confederation of Denmark and the Danish Gymnastics and Sports Associations. The former governs both ‘Sport for all’ and elite sport, whilst the latter has an exclusive focus on ‘Sport for all’. The main differences are ideological and whilst education and self-realisation are two keywords of the DGI, for the DIF the practising of sport and good friendships in club environments are goals in themselves and not the means to solve social, health and other societal problems. Sport for all is also {{in many ways the}} focus of this research. By considering the social ties between SGBs and their membership from the perspective of social capital through an exploration of the organisational structure and reported relationships, thoughts on inclusion vs. exclusion or associational life as a <b>school</b> <b>for</b> <b>democracy</b> take centre stage. It is commonly acknowledged that sport is an arena where the development of national norms, social skills and social networks occur naturally; sport regularly fulfils an important role in strategic national public policy such as social integration policy. Nevertheless, the structure of sport and its competitive elements render such policy goals as ‘Sport for all’ more difficult to achieve. This is further underlined by the number of additional integration projects carried out by sport associations, under the lead of SGBs, often in collaboration with and, most of the time, funded by different local and national governments around Europe. Despite the growing doubt about sport’s inherent capacity or perhaps because of this doubt, together with a greater need in a time of constant reduction of the welfare state, the topic of social responsibility has become increasingly important for the discourse in Scandinavian sport governance. As a result the research turned its interest towards social responsibility of and through sport. The effects on sport governance are in this chapter framed as tradition in transition. Despite what may at first come across as a major shift of focus, the lens remains the same: to investigate the social ties between SGBs and their membership through the governance of sport. Social capital still is and needs to be at the centre in order to better understand the relationships within governing bodies and in connection to why and how the governing bodies of sport may pay attention to the topic of social responsibility. Subsequently, this chapter will pay attention to the changing nature of Danish sport governance in the light of Sport for all and through the lens of social capital. Two types of social capital will be presented as central to sport governance and typical for the Danish case: the leisure ties and the professional ties. In order to address these themes the chapter is structured as follows. The next section introduces the reader to Danish sport. Then, methods and cases are outlined. The subsequent section outlines the theoretical framework used throughout the research to understand and explain the social relations central to the governance of Danish sport. Thereafter, the chapter focuses on two themes that stand out as the most important questions for the future of Danish sport governance. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some of the more important findings and their potential implications for the future of Danish sport governance...|$|E

In fact, many {{have argued that the}} recent trend replacing such associations with professional advocates and professional service providers has eroded valuable civic infrastructure (Putnam, 2000; Skocpol, 2003). But not all civic associations are in decline.
