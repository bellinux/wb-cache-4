60|$|This proved correct, for shortly {{afterward}} the sea broke {{about them in}} confused eddies, and the boat splashed and lurched as she crossed the troubled space that divided the tides. Then she forged ahead very fast, and blurred hills and shadowy cliffs soon loomed out. Whitney used the <b>sounding</b> <b>pole</b> again, the cliffs grew plainer, and when the land closed in on them, they dropped anchor. She brought up and, after helping to stow the canvas, Whitney climbed into his folding cot.|$|E

50|$|In 1904, the Coast and Geodetic Survey {{introduced}} the wire-drag technique into hydrography, {{in which a}} wire attached to two ships or boats and set at a certain depth by a system of weights and buoys was dragged between two points. This method revolutionized hydrographic surveying, as it allowed a quicker, less laborious, and far more complete survey of an area than did the use of lead lines and <b>sounding</b> <b>poles</b> that had preceded it, and it remained in use until the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Single-beam echosounders and fathometers {{began to}} enter {{service in the}} 1930s which used sonar to measure the depth beneath a vessel. This greatly {{increased}} the speed of acquiring sounding data over that possible with lead lines and <b>sounding</b> <b>poles</b> by allowing information on depths beneath a vessel to be gathered {{in a series of}} lines spaced at a specified distance. However, it shared the weakness of earlier methods by lacking depth information for areas in between the strips of sea bottom the vessel sounded.|$|R
50|$|Measuring {{the depth}} of water by lead and line dates back to ancient civilisation. Greek and Roman navigators {{are known to have}} used {{sounding}} leads, some of which have been uncovered by archaeologists. Sounding by lead and line continued throughout the medieval and early modern periods. The Bible describes lead and line sounding in Acts, whilst the Bayeux Tapestry documents the use of a sounding lead during King Harold’s landing in Normandy. Throughout this period, lead and line sounding operated alongside <b>sounding</b> <b>poles,</b> particularly when navigating in shallower waters and on rivers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1904, wire-drag {{surveys were}} {{introduced}} into hydrography, and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey′s Nicholas H. Heck played {{a prominent role}} in developing and perfecting the technique between 1906 and 1916. In the wire-drag method, a wire attached to two ships or boats and set at a certain depth by a system of weights and buoys was dragged between two points. If the wire encountered an obstruction, it would become taut and form a [...] "V" [...] shape. The location of the [...] "V" [...] revealed the position of submerged rocks, wrecks, and other obstructions, while the depth at which the wire was set showed the depth at which the obstruction was encountered. This method revolutionized hydrographic surveying, as it allowed a quicker, less laborious, and far more complete survey of an area than did the use of lead lines and <b>sounding</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|R
40|$|Early {{bathymetric}} measurements, or "soundings " {{were made}} by lowering a weighted line {{over the side of}} a boat and measuring the length of line output when the weight hit bottom. The lead weight was usually conical in shape, sometimes with a touch of wax or lard on the base to collect a small sample of the surficial sediment. Similarly, <b>sounding</b> <b>poles</b> were used in shallow water environments. The importance of these sounding measurements was noted in the logs of the H. M. S. Challenger expedition: "The ordinary deep-sea sounding lead, from 12 - 14 lbs. in weight, armed with lard, often gives valuable and reliable information concerning the deposits in all depths under 100 fathoms. " (H. M. S. Challenger Report on Deep-Sea Deposits, p. 1) Locations of these soundings {{were made by}} celestial navigation methods, using a sextant or earlier instruments such as astrolabes and quadrants to convert their observations to a position on a chart (Fairbridge,ed., 1966) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} hydrographic {{surveying}} dates almost {{as far back}} as that of sailing. For many centuries, a hydrographic survey required the use of lead lines [...] - [...] ropes or lines with depth markings attached to lead weights to make one end sink to the bottom when lowered over the side of a ship or boat [...] - [...] and <b>sounding</b> <b>poles,</b> which were poles with depth markings which could be thrust over the side until they touched bottom. In either case, the depths measured had to be read manually and recorded, as did the position of each measurement with regard to mapped reference points as determined by three-point sextant fixes. The process was labor-intensive and time-consuming and, although each individual depth measurement could be accurate, even a thorough survey as a practical matter could include {{only a limited number of}} sounding measurements relative to the area being surveyed, inevitably leaving gaps in coverage between single soundings.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately, {{the river}} flowed {{smoothly}} between its barriers of stone, and, <b>sounding</b> with two <b>poles</b> lashed together, the men got no bottom, {{and as the}} river swept them on, they began to wonder uneasily how they were to get back upstream. Once, indeed, Wheeler suggested something of the kind, {{but none of the}} others answered him, and he went on with his paddling.|$|R
50|$|Crevasses are the slits or deep chasms {{formed in}} the {{substance}} of a glacier as it passes over an uneven bed. They may be open or hidden. In {{the lower part of}} a glacier the crevasses are open. Above the snow-line they are frequently hidden by arched-over accumulations of winter snow. The detection of hidden crevasses requires care and experience. After a fresh fall of snow they can only be detected by <b>sounding</b> with the <b>pole</b> of the ice axe, or by looking to right and left where the open extension of a partially hidden crevasse may be obvious. The safeguard against accident is the rope, and no one should ever cross a snow-covered glacier unless roped to one, or even better to two companions. Anyone venturing onto crevasses should be trained in crevasse rescue.|$|R
