5|$|The Swedes {{were not}} {{popular in the}} regions that Sweden had gained at the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. With the new war going badly, insurgents saw their chance to rise up against the unpopular rule. Swedish response, {{especially}} in Scania, was more subtle than one might believe. An all out terror campaign would have been economically disastrous. Instead small patrols searching the woods were often employed combined with promises of carrots or <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local farmers.|$|E

All that is known is that it <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground and understory. The lesser melampitta feeds on insects as well as worms, snails, small frogs and even small fruit. It forages on the ground, probing through leaves by flipping them with its bill.|$|E
5|$|Targets for NIF are {{extremely}} expensive. Each one {{consists of a}} small open ended metal cylinder with transparent double-pane windows sealing each end. In order to efficiently convert the driver laser's light to the x-rays that drive the compression, the cylinder has to be coated in gold or other heavy metals. Inside, suspended on fine plastic wires, is a hollow plastic sphere containing the fuel. In order to provide symmetrical implosion, the metal cylinder and plastic sphere have extremely high machining tolerances. The fuel, normally a gas at room temperature, is deposited inside the sphere and then cryogenically frozen until it <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inside of the sphere. It is then smoothed by slowly warming it with an infrared laser to form a 100µm smooth layer {{on the inside of}} the pellet. Each target costs tens of thousands of dollars.|$|E

5|$|Australian ravens die {{most often}} by being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens are hit by {{vehicles}} than Australian magpies. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished {{in their first}} year of life. Immature birds are most at risk of dying as {{they are more likely to}} come into conflict with farmers. The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs. Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked. Australian ravens mostly eat faeces (often from the lamb's anus), afterbirth or stillborn lambs. Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious, containing around 21–44% protein, 9–37% fat and 10–30% carbohydrate. It has the consistency of treacle and often <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lamb's hindquarters or tail. The raven bites a sleeping lamb's tail, holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up. A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird, but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable. Wounded lambs can also succumb to Clostridium infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills. Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops. In areas of Western Australia, the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976, meaning that shooting on private land in rural areas is legal, although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted.|$|E

25|$|Another {{effective}} and inexpensive method to avoid arsenic contamination is to sink wells 500feet or deeper to reach purer waters.

25|$|Magnesium {{chloride}} is used {{in three}} ways for pavement ice control: Anti-icing, when maintenance professionals spread it onto roads before a snow storm to prevent snow from sticking and ice from forming; pre-wetting, which means a liquid formulation of magnesium chloride is sprayed directly onto salt as it is being spread onto roadway pavement, wetting the salt so that it <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road; and pre-treating, when magnesium chloride and salt are mixed together before they are loaded onto trucks and spread onto paved roads.|$|E
25|$|Cultivated peaches {{are divided}} into clingstones and freestones, {{depending}} on whether the flesh <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stone or not; both can have either white or yellow flesh. Peaches with white flesh typically are very sweet with little acidity, while yellow-fleshed peaches typically have an acidic tang coupled with sweetness, though this also varies greatly. Both colors often have some red on their skin. Low-acid white-fleshed peaches are the most popular kinds in China, Japan, and neighbouring Asian countries, while Europeans and North Americans have historically favoured the acidic, yellow-fleshed cultivars.|$|E

25|$|In {{a bid to}} {{maintain}} Israel's technological gap ahead of Arab states, the F-35 deal was pushed through instead of upgrading the air force's F-15s and F-16s. This approach <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> principle that Israel is the first country in the Middle East to receive the newest fighter aircraft. The IAF was sufficiently committed to this principle to override protests from the leaders of Israeli defense contractors, who claimed that the deal was damaging them.

25|$|Many {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} – which even if {{able to be}} banded require special bands to fit the unique shape of their legs – will crush bands with their powerful bills and claws. The ability to overcome this problem varies between species, and with some such as the Gang-gang cockatoo, it {{is known to be}} too dangerous to attempt banding. New World vultures also cannot be banded on their legs because they urinate onto their legs, causing corrosion of the bands into a powdery oxide that <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vulture’s leg and injures the bird. Dippers are also dangerously handicapped by ringing because the rings induce drag that makes it extremely difficult for them to catch prey in fast-flowing water.|$|E

25|$|Traditional orb webs are not {{effective}} for capturing moths, because only their scales will stick, allowing the moth to escape. The ladder webs of Scoloderus species {{appear to be}} adaptations in web design to increase moth capture. These webs extend vertically about seven times their width. When a moth slides down the web, it leaves a trail of scales until its body <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> web. However, these spiders {{do not seem to}} be closely related to bolas spiders. The nearest relatives seems to be the Cyrtarachneae (e.g. Pasilobus) of the Paleotropics. They also specialize on moths, and use threads that are beaded with sticky droplets. Celaenia and Taczanowskia species in South America seem to use chemical attractants to catch moths, too, and may also be closely related to bolas spiders.|$|E
25|$|While {{ancestor}} veneration is {{an ancient}} part of Filipino culture, the modern observance {{is believed to have}} been imported from Mexico when the islands (as part of the Spanish East Indies) were governed from Mexico City as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. During the holiday (observed every November 1), Filipinos customarily visit family tombs and other graves, which they repair and clean. Entire families spend a night or two at their loved ones' tombs, passing time with card games, eating, drinking, singing and dancing. Prayers such as the rosary are often said for the deceased, who are normally offered candles, flowers, food, and even liquor. Some Catholic Chinese Filipino families additionally offer joss <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dead, and observe customs otherwise associated with the Hungry Ghost Festival.|$|E
25|$|During eruptions of Hekla, {{fluorine}} {{is produced}} and <b>sticks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{surfaces of the}} grains of tephra. Fine grains can have a fluorine content of 350ppm, and fluorine poisoning can start in sheep at a diet with fluorine content of 25ppm. At 250ppm, death can occur within a few days. In 1783, 79% of the Icelandic sheep stock were killed, probably {{as a result of}} fluorosis caused by the eruption of Lakagígar. Some of the ash produced in this eruption had a fluorine content of 0.2%, and two days after the eruption contaminated grass had a dry weight content of up to 0.4% fluorine. 450 farms and 95,000 sheep were effected by the eruption. Some sheep were kept inside and fed on hay or moved, but other farmers were forced to graze their flocks outside.|$|E
