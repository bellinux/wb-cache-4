In the early 1930s {{a series of}} board disagreements within Charles Churchill & Co led to Arthur Chamberlain resigning as chairman of that company. He remained chairman of The Churchill Machine Tool Co, and the {{two companies}} diverged. Charles Churchill & Co changed from a <b>sales</b> <b>organisation</b> to become a manufacturer. Thereafter, both companies manufactured machine tooling, and Charles Churchill & Co became a group of companies. By the 1960s significant rationalisation took place in British manufacturing, with companies merging or being taken over {{in an attempt to}} achieve benefits from economies of scale and pooled resources. The Churchill Machine Tool Co was taken over by the Birmingham Small Arms Company, which merged with Alfred Herbert Ltd, with production moving to Coventry. Coincidentally, Charles Churchill & Co was taken over by Tube Investments (TI).|$|E

40|$|This action {{research}} thesis {{is about the}} predictors of <b>sales</b> performance within <b>organisations,</b> which are shifting from a manufacturer of goods towards a hybrid company, supplementing their goods offerings with services, or a pure service company. The objectives of this research have been to identify the key criteria that characterise successful <b>sales</b> <b>organisations</b> or salespeople within these types of companies and what differences exist between the sales approaches and salespeople’s behaviour. This research has further aimed to explore how people in <b>sales</b> <b>organisations</b> are recruited and developed {{within the context of}} such a change initiative. The latter aim is particularly important, since this study was conducted as an {{action research}} inquiry within the context of an interim management provider, who help their clients on these topics through external support. The author has adopted pragmatism as a theoretical position to reach {{a better understanding of the}} scope of the problems. This has generated actionable knowledge relevant for <b>sales</b> <b>organisations</b> transitioning from a goods-dominant business towards a hybrid or service-dominant business. A literature review has been conducted to get a better understanding of the drivers and forces beyond servitization and sales within a business-to-business (B 2 B) context. The first research action cycle was based on the problem definition and initial literature review. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were then applied as elements of the action research process. Qualitative research was a part of cycle one and quantitative research methods were applied in cycle two. Based on the existing literature and the interviews that were conducted, the role of technical and product knowledge, as well as customer and industry knowledge was investigated. Additionally, the relevance of adapting sales approaches to varying customer demands, the role of internal collaboration as a moderating factor for sales success and the role of sales control systems, with a particular focus on reward systems, were a part of further research within cycle two. Sixteen hypotheses were developed and tested by means of an electronic survey. This survey thus identified the differences between <b>sales</b> <b>organisations</b> with an industrial background (goods-dominant) and those with a background in IT and telecommunications (hybrid or service-dominant). In regard to most of the hypotheses presented here, this study found no evidence of significant differences between Industrial and IT <b>sales</b> <b>organisations.</b> As factors that significantly influence the performance of <b>sales</b> <b>organisations</b> within hybrid and servicedominant businesses, this study has identified reward systems and, in particular, the extent to which organisations use incentive compensation as a means for motivation, as well as the extent to which salespeople are rewarded for their results. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative research provided several interesting insights for <b>sales</b> <b>organisations</b> coping with change driven by servitization. As conducted within the scope of this thesis, an action research project aims at improving a problem faced by an organisation. The assumptions made to address the underlying problem and a potential resolution did – during cycle one – not turn out as suitable, so that the initial problem could not be addressed as initially planned. Instead of personality traits, differences between Industrial and IT <b>sales</b> <b>organisations</b> were identified based on knowledge, behaviour and control. This did also address the problem and improve the situation, even if it was not initially intended in this way...|$|R

50|$|Another {{possible}} reason {{given for the}} lack of success of the Star was Xerox's corporate structure. A longtime copier company, Xerox played to their strengths. They already had one significant failure in making their acquisition of Scientific Data Systems pay off. It is said that there were internal jealousies between the old line copier systems divisions that were responsible for bulk of Xerox's revenues and the new upstart division. Their marketing efforts were seen by some as half-hearted or unfocused. Furthermore, the most technically savvy sales representatives that might have sold office automation equipment were paid large commissions on leases of laser printer equipment costing up to a half-million dollars. No commission structure for decentralized systems could compete. The multi-lingual technical documentation market was also a major opportunity, but this needed cross-border collaboration for which few <b>sales</b> <b>organisations</b> were ready at the time.|$|R

Study adopted the survey design; questionnaires were used to collect necessary data from sales personnel across 10 states in South-Ssouth and South East Nigeria. Respondents rated the concept and application of participative management as it affects their work environment and sales output of the company. Statistical {{results of the study}} showed that 92. 08 % of the respondents believe that there are benefits derivable from participative management and that these benefits improve both sales output and workflow. 48 % believe that participative management is practised in firms. Hypotheses tested using the chi-square test statistic revealed that: Consumer goods companies benefit from practising participative management, Participative management has effect on sales output of consumer goods companies, and the concept of participative management is not fully practised by consumer goods companies in Nigeria.

40|$|<b>Sales</b> <b>organisations</b> {{indicated}} that opportunities for organic apples sales can increase when quality increases, in particular {{reducing the amount}} of russeting. The use of copper is probably the most important factor for russeting. Therefore a worst case scheme was compared with a scheme with reduced copper application. Furthermore, there was a particular interest in the effects on russeting of potassium bicarbonate (Armicarb) because this product might be an important element in a copper free fungicide scheme. Application of Armicarb was investigated on wet or dry canopy and effects of two different dosages were studied. All the schemes were compared with a worst case organic fungicide scheme with copper. The experiment was done on two year old Elstar trees because Elstar is the most important organically grown cultivar in the Netherlands. Effects of the schedules on russet and scab control were evaluated. At harvest no effects were found on scab. Between the different schemes with copper no differences were found in amount of russet. Only the highest dosage of Armicarb (10 kg/ha) and the schedules with Armicarb on a wet canopy gave more russet compared with the worst case scheme. Also effects on fruit rot were evaluated...|$|R

This study examines the change of public attitudes with regard to seft-treatment, development and circumstances of OTC drug use between 1990 und 2000. In {{the first part of}} this study we show that economic figures have changed, partly dramatically, not only in the pharmacies but also in other <b>sales</b> <b>organisations,</b> like drugstores, commercial houses and health food stores. The secound part examines the individuel acceptance of advertisments for OTC drugs. This acceptance is based on the subjective of the information in print media and TV spots. There is a difference in perception between 1990 and 2000. In 1990 people could better identify with presentations in TV, in 2000 print was appreciated more. The study further shows that TV is more suitable to install own criteria - may be as a hint for a certain therapy - than journals do. One of the main conclusions of this study is that OTC information in print advertisment and TV spots should be considered more in view of the rise and safety of self-medication...|$|R
