2500|$|The Carbon Dragon is {{predominantly}} a conventional wood and doped aircraft fabric glider, making judicious use of carbon fiber in the wing <b>spar</b> <b>caps,</b> control rods, flaperons and the elliptical tail boom to save weight. The control tubes are constructed by laying up the carbon fiber on aluminium tubing and then, when the carbon has cured, dissolving the aluminium with swimming pool acid. The cockpit is totally enclosed {{and the original}} design called for a cockpit width of [...] at the hips and [...] at the shoulder, although some have been modified to accommodate pilots of larger dimensions. The main aircraft structure consists of dual triangular torque boxes {{on each side of}} the fuselage. The wing employs a Culver SD airfoil that was designed by Irv Culver for the project and full-span flaperons of 30% chord. The flaperons can deploy from −5° to +15° as flaps and −4° to +16° as ailerons, with a 4:1 differential. The flaperons are driven by two, vertically mounted pushrods enclosed within the fuselage and connected to the side stick. The wing ribs forward of the spar are fabricated from [...] 5-ply mahogany and aft of the spar from [...] square spruce. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel, mounted on the hinged cockpit bottom door, that opens to allow the pilot to lift the aircraft for foot-launching. The aircraft was designed so that if the pilot falls while foot-launching his body will be in the rear fuselage cavity and not pinned under the aircraft. The ultimate structural load limit is +/-7.5 g, with a +/-5.0 g operational load limit.|$|E
25|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation by}} the NTSB showed that the wing's lower <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> had extensive stress fatigue and had fractures through the lower <b>spar</b> <b>cap,</b> vertically up the spar web and into the upper <b>spar</b> <b>cap.</b> The lower wing skin also found signs of fatigue in the area adjacent to the cracked <b>spar</b> <b>cap.</b> An examination of two other similar aircraft showed that the area of cracking was hidden from view by other fuselage structure.|$|R
40|$|Bend-twist {{coupling}} {{behavior is}} induced in a blade by displacing the suction side <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> towards the leading edge, {{and the pressure}} side one in the opposite direction. Additional couplings are introduced by rotating the <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> fibers. The structural configuration of the blade is optimized using an automated design environment. The resulting blade shows significant benefits in terms of mass and loads {{when compared to the}} baseline uncoupled one. Finally, the lightweight design concept is used to increase the rotor size, resulting in a larger energy yield for the same hub loads...|$|R
50|$|On 21 May 2012 the {{airworthiness}} authority {{responsible for the}} design, the US Federal Aviation Administration, issued an emergency Airworthiness Directive requiring 3,665 of the cantilever wing Cessna 210s to be inspected for cracks in the <b>spar</b> <b>cap,</b> wing <b>spar</b> and wing. Aircraft with more than 10,000 hours of airframe time were grounded immediately pending a visual inspection.|$|R
50|$|Wood {{wing spars}} of multipiece {{construction}} usually consist of {{upper and lower}} members, called <b>spar</b> <b>caps,</b> and vertical sheet wood members, known as shear webs or more simply webs, that span {{the distance between the}} <b>spar</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|E

40|$|A multi-objective {{optimization}} {{method for}} the structural design of horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) blades is presented. The main {{goal is to}} minimize the weight and cost of the blade which uses glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) coupled with carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) materials. The number {{and the location of}} layers in the <b>spar</b> <b>cap,</b> the width of the <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> and the position of the shear webs are employed as the design variables, while the strain limit, blade/tower clearance limit and vibration limit are taken into account as the constraint conditions. The optimization of the design of a commercial 1. 5 MW HAWT blade is carried out by combining FEM analysis and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm under ultimate (extreme) flap-wise load and edge-wise load conditions. The best solutions are described and the comparison of the obtained results with the original design is performed to prove the efficiency and applicability of the method. structural optimization design; horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) blades; non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) II; finite element method (FEM); blade weigh...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{sensitivity}} of the structural integrity of wind turbine blades to debonding of the shear web from the <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> was investigated. In this regard, modal analysis, static and fatigue testing were performed on a 45. 7 m blade for three states of the blade: (i) as received blade (ii) when a crack of 200 mm was introduced between the web and the <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> and (iii) when the crack was extended to 1000 mm. Calibration pull-tests for all three states of the blade were performed to obtain the strain-bending moment relationship of the blade according to the estimated target bending moment (BM) which the blade is expected to experience in its service life. The resultant data was used to apply appropriate load in the fatigue tests. The blade natural frequencies in flapwise and edgewise directions over a range of frequency domain were found by modal testing for all three states of the blade. The blade first natural frequency for each state was used for the flapwise fatigue tests. These were performed in accordance with technical specification IEC TS 61400 - 23. The fatigue results showed that, for a 200 mm crack between the web and <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> at 9 m from the blade root, the crack did not propagate at 50 % of the target BM up to 62, 110 cycles. However, when the load was increased to 70 % of target BM, some damages were detected on the pressure side of the blade. When the 200 mm crack was extended to 1000 mm, the crack began to propagate when the applied load exceeded 100 % of target BM and the blade experienced delaminations, adhesive joint failure, compression failure and sandwich core failure...|$|R

50|$|A new version, JS1C-21m, with 3 metre wing-tips, which {{increase}} the span to 21 metres, has been developed. The first flight was on 22 March 2012. Because {{of the higher}} wing loads and increased maximum take-off mass of 720 kg (increased from 600 kg), the wing/wingtip junction has been redesigned including stronger wing <b>spar</b> <b>caps</b> and thicker wing-tip spars.

40|$|Fatigue {{testing was}} {{conducted}} on Carbon Experimental and Twist-Bend Experimental (CX- 100 and TX- 100) 9 -m wind turbine research blades. The CX- 100 blade was designed to investigate {{the use of a}} carbon <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> to reduce weight and increase stiffness while being incorporated using conventional manufacturing techniques. The TX- 100 blade used carbon in the outboard portion of the skin to produce twist-bend coupling to passively alleviate aerodynamic loads. In the fatigue tests, the CX- 100 blade was loaded by a single hydraulic cylinder while the TX- 100 blade was loaded via a hydraulically-actuated resonant loading system called the Universal Resonant Exciter. The blades were outfitted with approximately 30 strain gages as well as displacement and load sensors. Both blades survived to cycle counts sufficient to demonstrate a 20 -year operational life. The CX- 100 blade failed at approximately 1. 6 million cycles because of a buckle and crack that formed and grew just outboard of max-chord. The TX- 100 blade failed because of a crack that grew from the termination point of the <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> at the midspan of the blade. This paper covers the results of the fatigue tests...|$|R

50|$|The {{wing spars}} were built from spruce <b>spar</b> <b>caps</b> with maple {{doublers}} at all attachment points and two 3/32 in balsa shear webs attached to 1/8 to 3/8 in balsa strips {{on the wing}} spars. The ribs were made from 3/32 in balsa. This construction resulted in a balsa spar box with tapered spruce caps. The leading edge was covered with 1/32 in balsa to form a leading edge D spar. The trailing edge was formed by two 2 in wide 1/32 in sheets forming a triangle with 1/8 to 3/8 in vertical spar sections in between the ribs. The covering was 1/2 mil Mylar. The 32 ft span wing weighed 5 lb and was capable of loads up to 100 pounds.|$|E
50|$|The forward wing {{was divided}} into two half spans so that their angles of {{incidence}} could be altered together to control pitch or independently for roll. The semi-spans were built around main box spars with spruce <b>spar</b> <b>caps</b> and plywood webs. Forward of the spar the wings were ply skinned, forming a D-shaped torsion box. Ribs were built from spruce trellis work. There was a secondary spar behind the main one and an over-all fabric covering. A trim tab was positioned inboard on {{the trailing edge of}} each half-span. The rear wing was similarly constructed but fixed in place. A long trailing edge flap could be raised, but not lowered, to steepen descents. The tips carried triangular endplate fins fitted with horn balanced rudders, spring centred and only opening outwards. These vertical tails were wooden structures with fabric covering.|$|E

50|$|The {{fuselage}} is {{carbon and}} glass fiber composite with epoxy resin. The wings have an elliptical planform, vertical or elliptical design winglets. The wing structure includes {{extensive use of}} carbon fiber, both in the sandwich skins and in the tapered I-beam wing spar which uses pultruded carbon rods for the <b>spar</b> <b>caps.</b> The wing geometry is notable in that it varies non-linearly from the root to the tip, both in overall planform shape and in wing section profile. The flaperons stretch for 11.0 meters of the full wingspan and their range of motion varies from positive landing L +8°, to +4° for thermalling, to 0°, -4°, and S -8° reflex positions for cruising. Schempp-Hirth-type spoilers extend on the upper wing surface only. Opening the single-element spoilers with stick held results in a noticeable nose-down pitch movement. This, however, can easily be avoided by maintaining the nose attitude relative to the horizon; doing this will cause little airspeed change. Closing the spoilers has a similar pitch-up effect, again easily controlled with stick movement. On approach, the spoilers are moderately effective. Descent rate can be quickly increased by slipping. At approach speed with spoilers out, {{there is a clear}} view ahead over the nose.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1979, Morry Hummel, {{who worked in the}} Curtis Wright {{experimental}} department during World War II, purchased the plans for Gary Watson’s Windwagon and the development of the [...] "Hummel Bird" [...] began. Because of the weather in Hummel's state of Ohio, a canopy was needed. The horizontal stabilizer attach construction was redesigned. The seat back was raised 5 inches so a shoulder harness could be added, and the instrument panel was raised 2 inches, increasing fuel capacity and leg room. The wing was completely re-engineered. The dihedral break on the Windwagon was in the middle; Morry made the center wing section straight and put the dihedral break {{at the point where the}} outer wing panels bolt to the center section. The Hummel Bird spar is built up of 1/8 6061-t6 aluminum angle <b>spar</b> <b>caps,</b> with a [...]040, 2024-t3 spar web. The spar cap angles are doubled in the center section, and tapered in the outer panels. The number of ribs was increased, the thickness of the skin was reduced, and the skins get even thinner toward the tips. The ribs are now a two piece design with one in front of the spar(nose rib) and one between the spars(main rib). The skins are riveted to the spars leaving no bump where the one piece ribs previously pushed the skin up where it crossed the spar. Both the Teenie Two and the Windwagon had tricycle landing gear, however, Morry preferred conventional landing gear so taildragger gear became a popular option. There were other changes as well, compromising a significant improvement over the wind wagon. He finished his project in July 1980. In July 1982, the plane was featured in an article written by Jack Cox, of Sport Aviation. Jack dubbed Morry’s new creation the “Hummel Bird” and the name stuck.|$|E
