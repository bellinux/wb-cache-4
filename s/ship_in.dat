5|$|Starting in 1916, {{the ships}} of the Braunschweig class were {{withdrawn}} from active service, {{primarily because of}} manpower shortages. Braunschweig {{was used as a}} training ship, and on 20 August 1917, was converted into a barracks <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Kiel. Elsass was also used as a barracks and training <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Kiel, having been withdrawn from active service on 25 July 1916. Hessen was converted into a depot <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Brunsbüttel in 1917, while Preussen became a depot <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Wilhelmshaven that same year. Lothringen was withdrawn from service in 1917 and used as an engineer training <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Wilhelmshaven. Guns removed from these ships starting in 1916 were used by the Imperial Army in World War I as railway guns.|$|E

5|$|After {{joining the}} fleet, the Wittelsbach class ships were {{assigned}} to the I Battle Squadron, where they replaced the older Brandenburg-class ships. Like the Kaiser Friedrich III-class ships, the Wittelsbachs were withdrawn from active service after the advent of the dreadnoughts. The five ships were recalled to active service at the outbreak of war in 1914. They {{were assigned to}} the IV Battle Squadron and deployed to the Baltic. However, due to their age and vulnerability, they were withdrawn from active service by 1916. They were used as training ships, with the exception of Mecklenburg, which was used as a prison <b>ship.</b> <b>In</b> 1919, Wittelsbach and Schwaben were converted into depot ships for minesweepers. By 1922, all of the ships had been broken up for scrap, with the exception of Zähringen. She was converted into a radio-controlled target <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1926–27. RAF bombers sank the <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Gotenhafen in 1944; the wreck was broken up in 1949–50.|$|E
25|$|Twenty EUV {{units were}} <b>shipped</b> <b>in</b> 2010–2016, {{short of the}} number that would be {{required}} for volume manufacturing. By comparison, ASML shipped over 60 NXT 193-nm immersion systems in 2016, and forecasts that 48 EUV units will be <b>shipped</b> <b>in</b> 2019. Six NXE:3100 units were <b>shipped</b> <b>in</b> 2010–2011. Eight NXE:3300B units were <b>shipped</b> <b>in</b> 2013Q3–2015Q1, fewer than the forecast 11 units. Two NXE:3350B units were <b>shipped</b> <b>in</b> late 2015, compared to a forecast six units.

5|$|British {{submarines}} {{were becoming}} increasingly {{active in the}} Baltic by late 1915; several cruisers had been sunk and the elderly Wittelsbach-class ships {{could no longer be}} risked there. Therefore, due to their age and vulnerability, they were withdrawn from active service and disarmed by 1916. They were used as training ships, with the exception of Mecklenburg, which was used as a prison <b>ship.</b> <b>In</b> 1919, Wittelsbach and Schwaben were converted into depot ships for minesweepers. The entire class, with the exception of Zähringen, were struck from the navy list after the end of World War I. Mecklenburg was struck on 27 January 1920, Wettin followed on 11 March 1920, and Wittelsbach and Schwaben were struck on 8 March 1921. The four ships were broken up between 1921–22. Zähringen was converted into a radio-controlled target <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1926–27. Royal Air Force bombers sank the <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Gotenhafen in 1944; the wreck was broken up in 1949–50.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1916, {{the four}} {{remaining}} ships were withdrawn from service with the fleet. They were placed into reserve on 15 August 1917. Deutschland and Schleswig-Holstein became barracks ships in Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, respectively. Hannover {{was used as a}} guard <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> the Danish belt, and Schlesien became a training <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Kiel. Guns removed from these ships starting in 1917 were used by the Imperial Army in World War I as railway guns.|$|E
5|$|Deutschland {{remained}} on the East Asia station until early 1900, when she travelled via the Mediterranean and Portsmouth to Kiel. After returning to Germany, Deutschland {{was used as a}} harbor ship, starting on 3 May 1904. She was renamed Jupiter on 22 November of that year. On 21 May 1906, the ship was stricken from the naval register and used briefly as a target <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1907. The Kaiserliche Marine sold the <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1908 for 120,000marks; she was broken up for scrap the following year in Hamburg-Moorburg.|$|E

5|$|Following {{decommissioning}} in 1997, {{the ship}} was earmarked for preservation as a museum <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Mumbai. Lack of funding prevented progress on the ship's conversion to a museum and it was speculated that the ship would {{be made into a}} training <b>ship.</b> <b>In</b> 2001, {{the ship was}} opened to the public by the Indian Navy, but the Government of Maharashtra was unable to find a partner to operate the museum on a permanent, long-term basis and the museum was closed after it was deemed unsafe for the public in 2012.|$|E
5|$|HMS Dreadnought was an ironclad turret ship {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the 1870s. Construction was halted {{less than a year}} after it began and she was {{redesigned}} to improve her stability and buoyancy. Upon completion in 1879, the ship was placed in reserve until she was commissioned in 1884 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. Upon her return 10 years later, she became a coast guard <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Ireland for two years. The ship then became a depot <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1897 before she was reclassified as a second-class battleship in 1900. Dreadnought participated in the annual fleet manoeuvres for the next two years before she became a training <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1902. The ship was taken out of service three years later and sold for scrap in 1908.|$|E
5|$|In November 1811, Emerald {{sailed to}} Portsmouth and was laid up in ordinary. Fitted {{out as a}} {{receiving}} <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1822, she was eventually broken up in January 1836.|$|E
25|$|The Belorussiya class cruiseferries (sometimes also {{referred}} to as the Gruziya class) were built by Wärtsilä Turku Shipyard, Finland in 1975–1976 for the Black Sea Shipping Company, Soviet Union. The five <b>ships</b> <b>in</b> the class were originally used in ferry service around the Black Sea. During the 1980s all <b>ships</b> <b>in</b> the class were rebuilt into cruise ships. During the end of the 1990s all <b>ships</b> <b>in</b> the class were sold to other operators. As of 2008, at least four <b>ships</b> <b>in</b> this class were in service. The effects of the new SOLAS regulations that came into effect in 2010 remain unknown.|$|R

5|$|Rearmed and re-boilered by the Japanese, Suwo was {{reclassified}} by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) as {{a coastal}} defense <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1908 {{and served as}} a training ship for several years. She was the flagship of the Japanese squadron that participated in the Battle of Tsingtao at the beginning of World War I and continued in that role until she became a gunnery training <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1917. The ship was disarmed in 1922 to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and probably scrapped around that time.|$|E
5|$|Reconstructed by the Japanese in 1905–1907, Iwami was {{reclassified}} by the Imperial Japanese Navy as {{a coastal}} defence <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1912. She {{participated in the}} Battle of Tsingtao {{at the beginning of}} World War I and supported the Japanese troops that landed in Siberia in 1918 during the Russian Civil War. Iwami was used as a training ship beginning in September 1921. The ship was disarmed in 1922 to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and sunk as a target <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> 1924.|$|E
5|$|Tegetthoff {{was laid}} down in 1876 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste. The ship was launched in 1878, and completed in 1881. She conducted her sea trials in October of that year, and was finally ready for commissioning in September 1882; Kaiser Franz Joseph attended the commissioning of the <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Pola. Financial difficulties had again delayed the ship's completion; the parliament finally voted to allocate funds to finish the <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> November 1881. At the time, she was {{the largest and most}} powerful <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> the Austro-Hungarian fleet, and she would keep that distinction until {{after the turn of the}} century. She was, nevertheless, a political compromise, and was much smaller than foreign casemate ships, particularly British and French vessels.|$|E
50|$|The {{numbers of}} whaling <b>ships</b> {{outfitted}} <b>in</b> the Netherlands grew rapidly—more than doubling thomasses {{in a decade}} to 70 <b>ships</b> <b>in</b> 1654, and more than doubling again to 148 <b>ships</b> <b>in</b> 1670. The <b>ships</b> involved <b>in</b> whaling helped to make the Dutch Republic {{one of the richest}} nations of the 17th century, but this resource was ruthlessly exploited; and by the mid-17th century the catches decreased as the favoured whales became rare.|$|R
2500|$|The beans {{should be}} dry for {{shipment}} (usually by sea). Traditionally exported in jute bags, {{over the last}} decade, beans are increasingly <b>shipped</b> <b>in</b> [...] "mega-bulk" [...] parcels of several thousand tonnes at a time on <b>ships,</b> or <b>in</b> smaller lots around 25 tonnes <b>in</b> 20-ft containers. <b>Shipping</b> <b>in</b> bulk significantly reduces handling costs; shipment in bags, however, either <b>in</b> a <b>ship's</b> hold or <b>in</b> containers, is still common.|$|R

5|$|The {{ship was}} then {{assigned}} to the Eastern Fleet where she remained until 1943. She was converted into a gunnery training <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> Durban, South Africa, between 21 June–3 July, and was transferred to Colombo, Ceylon, in 1944. Caradoc became an accommodation <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> April 1944 and then the flagship of the East Indies Fleet, as the Eastern Fleet had been renamed, in August 1945. She was placed in reserve in December 1945 after she returned home. The ship was sold for scrap on 5 April 1946 and subsequently broken up at Briton Ferry, Wales.|$|E
50|$|Following {{return from}} Carib 1-70, Terrebonne Parish participated in {{riverine}} operations in St. Helena Sound, South Carolina.

5|$|A midget or fleet {{submarine}} attack. Extensive searches {{immediately following}} the sinking had failed to detect any enemy submarine, and the Allies had made no attempt at claiming the enormous propaganda value of sinking a capital <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> her home anchorage; consequently, this possibility was quickly discounted. Eyewitnesses also spoke of a reddish-brown fireball, which indicated a magazine explosion; this was confirmed during exploration of the wreck by divers.|$|E
5|$|Advances {{were made}} in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with {{aircraft}} carriers and submarines. Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success {{at the start of}} the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> place of the battleship.|$|E
5|$|After the Grand Fleet was {{dissolved}} in early 1919, Monarch {{was transferred to}} back to the Home Fleet {{for a few months}} before she was assigned to the Reserve Fleet.
