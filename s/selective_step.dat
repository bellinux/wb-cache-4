40|$|Computational {{creativity}} is an emerging branch of artificial intelligence that places {{computers in the}} center of the creative process. Broadly, creativity involves a generative step to produce many ideas and a <b>selective</b> <b>step</b> to determine the ones that are the best. Many previous attempts at computational creativity, however, have not been able to achieve a valid <b>selective</b> <b>step.</b> This work shows how bringing data sources from the creative domain and from hedonic psychophysics together with big data analytics techniques can overcome this shortcoming to yield a system that can produce novel and high-quality creative artifacts. Our data-driven approach is demonstrated through a computational creativity system for culinary recipes and menus we developed and deployed, which can operate either autonomously or semi-autonomously with human interaction. We also comment on the volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of data in computational creativity. I...|$|E
40|$|Adeno-associated virus (AAV) {{has been}} {{developed}} as a promising human gene therapy vector. Particularly, recombinant AAV vector (rAAV) achieves its transduction of host cells by crossing at least three physiological barriers including plasma membrane, endosomal membrane, and nuclear envelope (NE). So far, the AAV transduction mechanism has not been explored thoroughly at the single viral particle level. In this study, we employed high-speed super-resolution single-point edge-excitation sub-diffraction (SPEED) microscopy to map the events of single rAAV 2 particles infecting live human cells with an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution of 9 â 12 nm and 2 â 20 ms. Data reveal that rAAV 2 particles are imported through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) rather than nuclear membrane budding into the nucleus. Moreover, approximately 17 % of the rAAV 2 molecules starting from the cytoplasm successfully transverse the NPCs to reach the nucleoplasm, revealing that the NPCs act as a strict <b>selective</b> <b>step</b> for AAV delivery.

40|$|Binding of proteolyzed {{fragments}} of proteins to MHC molecules is essential {{and the most}} <b>selective</b> <b>step</b> that determines T-cell epitopes. Therefore, the prediction of MHC-peptide binding is principal for anticipating potential T cell epitopes and is of immense relevance in vaccine design. Despite numerous methods for predicting MHC binding ligands, there still exist limitations that affect the reliability of a prevailing number of methods. Certain important methods based on physicochemical properties have very low reported accuracy. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present a new approach of extracting the most important physicochemical properties that influence the classification of MHC-binding ligands. In this study, we have developed rule based classification models which take into account the physicochemical properties of amino acids and their frequencies. The models use k-means clustering technique for extracting the relevant physicochemical properties. The results of the study indicate that the physicochemical properties of amino acids contribute significantly to the peptide-binding and that the different alleles are characterized by a different set of the physicochemical properties...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the propensity}} to withdraw European patent applications within a regional sample of Italian applicants. The procedure for obtaining a granted patent from the EPO {{is composed of}} a series of sequential and <b>selective</b> <b>steps</b> imposing additional costs to the applicants. Accordingly, we argue that early withdrawals - i. e. those occurring before the proper examination process begins - should be treated separately from late withdrawals. Our findings show the probability of an early withdrawal is higher for applicants with lower resources and competencies and rises with the number of backward citations added by EPO examiners to the original application. Late withdrawals, instead, are negatively affected by one factor only: the size of patent family, which approximates the sunk costs born by applicants in order to extend the geographical scope of patent protection. Such a limited explanation suggests that the (unobserved) interventions of EPO examiners are likely to {{play a significant role in}} inducing late withdrawals. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{animals and}} plants have {{symbiotic}} relationships with beneficial bacteria. Experimentally tractable models are necessary to understand the processes involved in the selective transmission of symbiotic bacteria. One such model is the transmission of the insect-pathogenic bacterial symbionts Photorhabdus spp. by Heterorhabditis bacteriophora infective juvenile (IJ) -stage nematodes. By observing egg-laying behavior and IJ development, {{it was determined that}} IJs develop exclusively via intrauterine hatching and matricide (i. e., endotokia matricida). By transiently exposing nematodes to fluorescently labeled symbionts, it was determined that symbionts infect the maternal intestine as a biofilm and then invade and breach the rectal gland epithelium, becoming available to the IJ offspring developing in the pseudocoelom. Cell- and stage-specific infection occurs again in the pre-IJ pharyngeal intestinal valve cells, which helps symbionts to persist as IJs develop and move to a new host. Synchronous with nematode development are changes in symbiont and host behavior (e. g., adherence versus invasion). Thus, Photorhabdus symbionts are maternally transmitted by an elaborate infectious process involving multiple <b>selective</b> <b>steps</b> in order to achieve symbiont-specific transmission...|$|R
40|$|Background. Binding of {{peptides}} to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules is {{the single}} most <b>selective</b> <b>step</b> in the recognition of pathogens by the cellular immune system. The human MHC class I system (HLA-I) is extremely polymorphic. The number of registered HLA-I molecules has now surpassed 1500. Characterizing the specificity of each separately would be a major undertaking. Principal Findings. Here, we have drawn on a large database of known peptide-HLA-I interactions to develop a bioinformatics method, which takes both peptide and HLA sequence information into account, and generates quantitative predictions of the affinity of any peptide-HLA-I interaction. Prospective experimental validation of peptides predicted to bind to previously untested HLA-I molecules, cross-validation, and retrospective prediction of known HIV immune epitopes and endogenous presented peptides, all successfully validate this method. We further demonstrate that the method can be applied to perform a clustering analysis of MHC specificities and suggest using this clustering to select particularly informative novel MHC molecules for future biochemical and functional analysis. Conclusions. Encompassing all HLA molecules, this high-throughput computational method lends itself to epitope searches that are not only genome- and pathogen-wide, but also HLA-wide. Thus, it offers a truly global analysis of immune responses supporting rational development of vaccines and immunotherapy. It also promises to provide new basic insights into HLA structure-functio...|$|E

Exposure to monensin significantly reduced the proteolytic maturation and externalization of viral glycoproteins {{resulting in a}} stable cellular accumulation of a single 70, 000 -Mr glycosylated polyprotein (designated gp 70). Cell surface- and intracellular-specific immunoprecipitations of monensin-treated cells revealed that gp 70 can be localized to the cell surface only {{in the presence of}} 1 microM dexamethasone, while in uninduced cells gp 70 is irreversibly sequestered in an intracellular compartment. Analysis of oligosaccharide processing kinetics demonstrated that gp 70 acquired resistance to endoglycosidase H with a half-time of 65 min in {{the presence or absence of}} hormone. In contrast, gp 70 was inefficiently galactosylated after a 60 -min lag in uninduced cells while rapidly acquiring this carbohydrate modification in the presence of dexamethasone.

40|$|Rational {{design of}} epitope-driven {{vaccines}} {{is a key}} goal of immunoinformatics. Typically, candidate selection relies on the prediction of MHC–peptide binding only, as this {{is known to be}} the most <b>selective</b> <b>step</b> in the MHC class I antigen processing pathway. However, proteasomal cleavage and transport by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) are essential steps in antigen processing as well. While prediction methods exist for the individual steps, no method has yet offered an integrated prediction of all three major processing events. Here we present WAPP, a method combining prediction of proteasomal cleavage, TAP transport, and MHC binding into a single prediction system. The proteasomal cleavage site prediction employs a new matrix-based method that is based on experimentally verified proteasomal cleavage sites. Support vector regression is used for predicting peptides transported by TAP. MHC binding is the last step in the antigen processing pathway and was predicted using a support vector machine method, SVMHC. The individual methods are combined in a filtering approach mimicking the natural processing pathway. WAPP thus predicts peptides that are cleaved by the proteasome at the C terminus, transported by TAP, and show significant affinity to MHC class I molecules. This results in a decrease in false positive rates compared to MHC binding prediction alone. Compared to prediction of MHC binding only, we report an increased overall accuracy and a lower rate of false positive predictions for the HLA-A* 0201, HLA-B* 2705, HLA-A* 01, and HLA-A* 03 alleles using WAPP.

40|$|T cells {{bearing the}} alpha beta T cell {{receptor}} (TCR) {{can be divided}} into CD 4 + 8 - and CD 4 - 8 + subsets which develop in the thymus from CD 4 + 8 + precursors. The commitment to the CD 4 and CD 8 lineage depends on the binding of the alpha beta TCR to thymic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) coded class II and class I molecules, respectively. In an instructive model of lineage commitment, the binding of the alpha beta TCR, for instance to class I MHC molecules, would generate a specific signal instructing the CD 4 + 8 + precursors to switch off the expression of the CD 4 gene. In a selective model, the initial commitment, i. e. switching off the expression of either the CD 4 or the CD 8 gene would be a stochastic event which is then followed by a <b>selective</b> <b>step</b> rescuing only CD 4 + class II and CD 8 + class I specific T cells while CD 4 + class I and CD 8 + class II specific cells would have a very short lifespan. The selective model predicts that a CD 8 transgene which is expressed in all immature and mature T cells should rescue CD 4 + class I MHC specific T cells from cell death. We have performed experiments in CD 8 transgenic mice which fail to support a selective model and we present data which show that the binding of the alpha beta TCR to thymic class I MHC molecules results in up-regulation of the TCR in the CD 4 + 8 + population.

40|$|The {{proposal}} of kinetic molecular sieving of hydrogen isotopes is explored by employing statistical rate theory methods {{to describe the}} kinetics of molecular hydrogen transport in model microporous carbon structures. A Lennard-Jones atom-atom interaction potential is utilized for {{the description of the}} interactions between H(2) /D(2) and the carbon framework, while the requisite partition functions describing the thermal flux of molecules through the transition state are calculated quantum mechanically in view of the low temperatures involved in the proposed kinetic molecular sieving application. Predicted kinetic isotope effects for initial passage from the gas phase into the first pore mouth are consistent with expectations from previous modeling studies, namely, that at sufficiently low temperatures and for sufficiently narrow pore mouths D(2) transport is dramatically favored over H(2). However, in contrast to expectations from previous modeling, the absence of any potential barrier along the minimum energy pathway from the gas phase into the first pore mouth yields a negative temperature dependence in the predicted absolute rate coefficients-implying a negative activation energy. In pursuit of the effective activation barrier, we find that the minimum potential in the cavity is significantly higher than in the pore mouth for nanotube-shaped models, throwing into question the common assumption that passage through the pore mouths should be the rate-determining step. Our results suggest a new mechanism that, depending on {{the size and shape of}} the cavity, the thermal activation barrier may lie in the cavity rather than at the pore mouth. As a consequence, design strategies for achieving quantum-mediated kinetic molecular sieving of H(2) /D(2) in a microporous membrane will need, at the very least, to take careful account of cavity shape and size in addition to pore-mouth size in order to ensure that the <b>selective</b> <b>step,</b> namely passage through the pore mouth, is also the rate determining step...|$|E

Whole genome sequencing analysis identified eleven single, unique mutations (four synonymous, six non-synonymous, one intergenic), in addition to drug resistance-conferring mutations, that were fixed in the genomes of six monoresistant strains. Eight loci, present as minority variants (five non-synonymous, three synonymous) in the genome of the susceptible parent strain, became fixed in the genomes of multiple daughter strains. None of these mutations are known to be involved with drug resistance. Our results confirm previously observed genomic stability for M. tuberculosis, although the parent strain had accumulated allelic variants at multiple locations in an antibiotic-free in vitro environment. It is therefore likely to assume that these so-called hitchhiking mutations were co-selected and fixed in multiple daughter strains during antibiotic selection.

40|$|The immune {{response}} after brain injury is highly complex and involves {{both local and}} systemic events at the cellular and molecular level. It is associated to a dramatic over-activation of enzyme systems, the expression of proinflammatory genes and the activation/recruitment of immune cells. The complement system represents a powerful component of the innate immunity and is highly involved in the inflammatory response. Complement components are synthesized predominantly by the liver and circulate in the bloodstream primed for activation. Moreover, brain cells can produce complement proteins and receptors. After acute brain injury, the rapid and uncontrolled activation of the complement leads to massive release of inflammatory anaphylatoxins, recruitment of cells to the injury site, phagocytosis and induction of blood brain barrier damage. Brain endothelial cells are particularly susceptible to complement-mediated effects, since {{they are exposed to}} both circulating and locally synthesized complement proteins. Conversely, during neurodegenerative disorders, complement factors play distinct roles depending on the stage and degree of neuropathology. In addition to the deleterious role of the complement, increasing evidence suggest that it may also play a role in normal nervous system development (wiring the brain) and adulthood (either maintaining brain homeostasis or supporting regeneration after brain injury). This article represents a compendium of the current knowledge on the complement role in the brain, prompting a novel view that complement activation can result in either protective or detrimental effects in brain conditions that depend exquisitely on the nature, the timing and the degree of the stimuli that induce its activation.

Our standard HPRTminigene, {{under the control of the}} mouse phosphoglycerate kinase- 1 gene promoter, was stably expressed at five of six target loci examined.

A different minigene, under the control of the mouse HPRT promoter and embedded in its natural CpG-rich island, overcame this position effect and was stably expressed when targeted to the identical site in the Lig 1 locus. The promoter region of the stably expressed minigene remained unmethylated, while the promoter of the unstably expressed minigene rapidly became fully methylated. The difference in the stability of HPRT minigene expression at the same target locus can be explained in the context of the different lengths of their CpG-rich promoter regions with associated transcription factors and a resulting difference in their susceptibility to DNA methylation, rather than by differences in promoter strength...|$|R

40|$|Functional pollen {{is needed}} to {{successfully}} complete fertilization. Pollen is formed inside the anthers following a specific sequence of developmental stages, from microsporocyte meiosis to pollen release, that concerns microsporocytes/microspores and anther wall tissues. The processes involved may not be synchronous within a flower, an anther, and even a microsporangium. Asynchrony has been barely analyzed, and its biological consequences have not been yet assessed. In this review, different processes of pollen development and lifetime, stressing on the possible consequences of their differential timing on pollen performance, are summarized. Development is usually synchronized until microsporocyte meiosis I (occasionally until meiosis II). Afterwards, a period of mostly asynchronous events extends up to anther opening as regards: (1) meiosis II (sometimes); (2) microspore vacuolization and later reduction of vacuoles; (3) amylogenesis, amylolysis, and carbohydrate inter-conversion; (4) the first haploid mitosis; and (5) intine formation. Asynchrony would promote metabolic differences among developing microspores and therefore physiologically heterogeneous pollen grains within a single microsporangium. Asynchrony would increase the effect of competition for resources during development and pollen tube growth and also for water during (re) hydration on the stigma. The differences generated by developmental asynchronies may have an adaptive role since more efficient pollen grains would be selected with regard to homeostasis, desiccation tolerance, resilience, speed of (re) hydration, and germination.

During induction, RAG mRNA expression is downregulated, but lineage commitment does not occur. Rather, lineage commitment (which depends upon the MHC class specificity of the αβTCR) only occurs after downregulation of RAG expression and the consequent fixation of αβTCR specificity. We propose that positive selection can be viewed as a sequence of increasingly <b>selective</b> developmental <b>steps</b> (induction→commitment→rescue) that are signaled by αβTCR engagements of intrathymic ligands...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of selective functionalization strategies ofwhite phosphorus (P 4) {{is important to}} avoid the current chlori-nated intermediates. The use of transition metals (TMs) couldlead to catalytic procedures, but these are severely hamperedby the high reactivity and unpredictable nature of the tetrahe-dron. Herein, we report <b>selective</b> first <b>steps</b> by reacting P 4 witha metal anion [Cp*Fe(CO) 2](Cp*= C 5 (CH 3) 5), which, in thepresence of bulky Lewis acids (LA; B(C 6 F 5) 3 or BPh 3), leads tounique TM-substituted LA-stabilized bicyclo[1. 1. 0]tetraphos-phabutanide anions [Cp*Fe(CO) 2 (h 1 -P 4 ·LA) ]. Their P-nucleo-philic site can be subsequently protonated to afford the transi-ent LA-free neutral butterflies exo,endo- and exo,exo-Cp*Fe-(CO) 2 (h 1 -P 4 H), allowing controllable stepwise metalate-mediat-ed functionalization of P 4...|$|R
40|$|By saturating a {{photochromic}} transition with a nodal illumination (wavelength, λ), one isomeric {{form of a}} small molecule is spatially localized to {{a region}} smaller than the far-field diffraction limit. A <b>selective</b> oxidation <b>step</b> effectively locks this pattern allowing repeated patterning. Using this approach and a two-beam interferometer, we demonstrate isolated lines as narrow as λ/ 8 (78 nm) and spacing between features as narrow as λ/ 4 (153 nm). This is considerably smaller than the minimum far-field diffraction limit of λ/ 2. Most significantly, nanopatterning is achieved via single-photon reactions and at low light levels, which in turn allow for high throughput.
