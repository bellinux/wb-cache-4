5|$|She {{moved around}} several more camps, and survived {{the sinking of}} the {{transport}} ship SS Van Warwyck where in the aftermath she saved several passengers from drowning. Les Searle from the Grasshopper smuggled her once again into the next camp, where she was reunited with Frank Williams. After the end of the war, Judy's life was put in danger once again. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be put to death by the Japanese guards following a lice outbreak amongst the prisoners. However, Williams hid the dog until the Allied forces arrived. Searle, Williams, and others smuggled Judy back to the UK aboard a troopship and she spent the next six months in quarantine after arriving. She was awarded the Dickin Medal by the PDSA, considered to be the animals' Victoria Cross. Judy died in 1950 in Tanzania from a tumour, after travelling with Williams there to work on a groundnut food scheme. Her Dickin Medal and collar were subsequently put on display at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford as part of 'The Animal's War' exhibition.|$|E

As a result, she didn't realise <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how sorry she is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death.

25|$|In April 1912, Helene married Felix Deutsch. Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Helene experienced {{the first of many}} miscarriages. In The Psychology of Women, Helene discussed the concept of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage as a result of psychological factors, with a critical factor involving the 'pregnant woman's unconscious rejection of an identification with her own mother.' Under the pseudonym of a patient named Mrs. Smith, Helene {{tells the story of a}} woman who has trouble bringing a baby to full term. Helene wrote that Mrs. Smith was the youngest child of a large family, where her mother's disappointment that she was not a boy was evident.

When she married and wanted to have a child, Mrs. Smith had difficulty reconciling her desire for a child with her mother's rejection of her. When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> become a mother herself, Mrs. Smith's fear about identifying with her mother intensified.
