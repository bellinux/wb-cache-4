5000|$|Anthony {{proposes that}} the Proto-Indo-European {{language}} emerged after ca. 3500 BCE. He bases this especially on {{his analysis of}} Indo-European terms for wool textiles and wheeled vehicles, Neither woven wool textiles nor wheeled vehicles existed before about 4000 BCE. It is possible that neither existed before about 3500 BCE. Yet Proto-Indo-European speakers spoke regularly about wheeled vehicles and some <b>sort</b> of <b>wool</b> textile. This vocabulary suggests that Proto-Indo-European was spoken after 4000-3500 BCE.|$|R

50|$|Al Sadu in the United Arab Emirates is a {{traditional}} form of weaving practised by Bedouin women in rural communities. Traditionally men shear goats and camels, and the wool is cleaned and prepared by the women. The yarn is spun on a drop spindle, then dyed using local plant extracts (such as henna or saffron), and then woven on a floor loom using a warp-faced plain weave. The traditional colours are black, white, brown, beige and red, with distinctive patterns {{in the form of}} narrow bands of geometric designs. The result is colourful products: clothing, camel and horse decorations, Bedouin tents, majlis floor pillows, carpets and mats. Traditionally, women gather in small groups to spin and weave, exchanging family news and occasionally chanting and reciting poetry. Such gatherings are also the means of transmitting the tradition: girls learn by watching, and are gradually given tasks to do, such as <b>sorting</b> the <b>wool,</b> before learning the more intricate skills involved.|$|R

50|$|After {{the bulk}} classers had <b>sorted</b> the <b>wool</b> {{it was taken}} to bins, {{examined}} by an overlooker and then made into sale bales, sent to be shown by wool lifts. The warehouse show floors made sure to provide ample space and light, which would mean wool from different districts could be easily separated. One {{of the ways in}} which this was achieved was the use of saw tooth roofs. The new Woolstores built in 1872 put Geelong on par with Melbourne. They were especially built for wool and were designed by keeping wool selling needs in mind, which included storage, inspection, viewing and sales.Owners of the wool were able to readily compare the condition of their clips. It also meant that those buying could examine the wool lots quickly. On sale days, the wool was moved up to the top floor, with its bright natural light, and opened so that potential buyers could inspect the wool. Often sampling occurred on the show floor where wool was taken and assessed. The raw wool would be sold at auction and then dispatched by road, rail or sea.|$|R
60|$|The small front parlor {{was as good}} as {{a temple}} that morning. The {{sunlight}} was on the river and soft air came in through the open window; the walls showed a glorious silent cloud of witnesses--the Virgin soaring amid her cherubic escort; grand Melancholia with her solemn universe; the Prophets and Sibyls; the School of Athens; the Last Supper; mystic groups where far-off ages made one moment; grave Holbein and Rembrandt heads; the Tragic Muse; last-century children at their musings or their play; Italian poets--all were there through the medium of a little black and white. The neat mother who had weathered her troubles, and come out of them with a face still cheerful, was <b>sorting</b> colored <b>wools</b> for her embroidery. Hafiz purred on the window-ledge, the clock on the mantle-piece ticked without hurry, and the occasional sound of wheels seemed to lie outside the more massive central quiet. Mrs. Meyrick thought that this quiet might be the best invitation to speech on the part of her companion, and chose not to disturb it by remark. Mirah sat opposite in her former attitude, her hands clasped on her lap, her ankles crossed, her eyes at first traveling slowly over the objects around her, but finally resting with a sort of placid reverence on Mrs. Meyrick. At length she began to speak softly.|$|R
60|$|Now that I am a settled man {{and have}} many birds--the {{canaries}} have just hatched out four nestlings--I have before me {{the problem that}} Locke waved aside. As I gave them an artificial nest, a hollow vessel like a saucer, they had no need of that skill the wild bird shows, each species having its own preference among the lichen, or moss; but they could <b>sort</b> out <b>wool</b> and hair and a certain soft white down that I found under a big tree. They would twist a stem of grass till it was limber, and would wind it all about {{the centre of the}} nest, and when the four grey eggs were laid, the mother bird knew how to turn them over from time to time, that they might be warmed evenly; and how long she must leave them uncovered, that the white might not be dried up, and when to return that the growing bird might not take cold. Then the young birds, even when they had all their feathers, were very still as compared with the older birds, as though any habit of movement would disturb the nest or make them tumble out. One of them would now and again pass on the food that he had received from his mother's beak to some other nestling. The father had often pecked the mother bird before the eggs were laid, but now, until the last nestling was decently feathered, he took his share in the feeding, and was very peaceable, and it was only when the young could be left to feed themselves that he grew jealous and had to be put into another cage.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Current routine semen {{preparation}} techniques do not inclusively target all intrinsic sperm {{characteristics that}} may impact the fertilization potential. In {{order to address}} these characteristics, several methods have been recently developed and applied to sperm selection. The objective {{of this study was}} to systematically review the literature describing these advanced sperm selection methods focusing on their anticipated benefits on sperm quality and assisted reproductive technique (ART) outcome. METHODS: Systematic literature review was conducted by means of a Medline literature search. Sperm quality parameters assessed included: motility, morphology, viability, DNA integrity, apoptosis and maturity. ART outcomes assessed included: fertilization, embryo quality, pregnancy, abortion and live birth rates. RESULTS: A total of 44 studies were identified describing four advanced sperm selection methods based on: (i) surface charge (electrophoresis and zeta potential), (ii) apoptosis (magnetic cell <b>sorting</b> and glass <b>wool),</b> (iii) membrane maturity (hyaluronic acid binding) and (iv) ultramorphology (high magnification). Selection of high-quality sperm including improvements in DNA integrity, resulted from the application of these methods. Fertilization and pregnancy rates showed improvement following some of the advanced sperm selection techniques. CONCLUSIONS: While some of the advanced sperm selection methods are of value in specific clinical ART settings, others are in need of further evaluation. More clinical studies on safety and efficacy are needed before the implementation of advanced sperm selection methods could be universally recommended in ART...|$|R

40|$|Since 2000 a {{multidisciplinary}} team of archaeologists, geologists and paleobotanists has been carrying out joint investigations at Ca’ Tron, a 11 km 2 estate {{located at the}} northern lagoon of Venice and included in the east countryside of the ancient Venetian-Roman Altinum. During the systematic survey conducted in Ca’ Tron estate nine Roman sites were identified, three of which were excavated in extension. Two rural settlements are analyzed in this paper, both attended since Ist to IV-V th century AD, having different planimetric features and economic role: {{the first one was}} a farm with several outbuildings, the second one was specialized in breeding sheep, with a large rectangular building, interpretable as a sheepfold on the basis of comparison with the Roman “bergeries” investigated in the Crau of Arles (Provence). Particularly relevant to the understanding of economic activities were the micromorphological analysis of soil types, chemical and biological, especially to clarify the functions of spaces and rooms, and the study of the archaeozoological finds. The results of chemical analyses support the archaeological interpretation of the remains of the two Roman rural sites, and suggest that some buildings were stables for bred cattle, showing that the site is particularly rich with P and organic matter of not-vegetable origin. Analyses of the Phosphorus, Carbon and Nitrogen content of the soil, together with Elemental Ratios, were applied. Two different methods (ignition and hydrolysis with perchloric acid) were used to determine the phosphorus content: their reliability is discussed. The faunal remains studied, though not very large in number, allow nevertheless to understand the management of farm animals and the economic system within the two rural complexes. Samples from both the two sites, A and M, share the almost exclusive presence of only the main domestic stock-raising species: bovines, caprovines and swine. Animals appears to have been exploited not only for meat, but also the cattle as power (in site A) and the caprovines (both sites) to obtain secondary products (milk and wool). Data analyzed suggest a differential exploitation of animal resources, apparently focused at rearing medium-sized animals (caprovines and swine) in the M settlement, whereas, in site A, bovines appeared important for the local economy as well. The research results allow the reconstruction of {{the eastern part of the}} Altinum ager complementary and integrated economy, which guaranteed the practice of all vital activities for the community: agriculture on the one hand, on the other breeding, particularly in sheep. The complex M Ca’ Tron attests to the practice of intensive and sedentary breeding of a delicate breed of sheep, which produced a <b>sort</b> of <b>wool</b> famous in anciente times for its softness; and this kind of breeding used independent housing facilities. It seems likely therefore that in the Venetia both types of farming were simultaneously present, sedentary and transhumant, according to race, a situation similar to the one documented for the Apulia et Calabria...|$|R
40|$|Allan Waters, a {{communal}} area near Queenstown {{in the former}} Ciskei of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, have about 80 households {{who are involved in}} agriculture. These households were surveyed with two questionnaires. The first was at household level, focusing on the current socioeconomic situations and farming systems. Data were collected from sixty-three households in the village. The socio-economics questionnaire was divided into sections: demographic information, land and agricultural information, income and expenditure. In order to improve the livelihood of the households and to secure food production and food security, a situation analysis of the rural farmers was carried out using typology as a research tool. Typologies were built in order to analyze the diversity of production units (farms) or households (agricultural households). To define household typologies, factors such as land, source of income, modes of farming and composition of the family were used to identify six typology categories and to divide these into two main groups. The two main groups comprised of (a) livestock farming and (b) non-livestock farming or very little farming activities. The six types are as follows: Type 1 : Poverty-stricken households Type 2 : Newly arrived households Type 3 : Households’ depending on old age pensions Type 4 : Households’ main income from old age pensions and supported by substantial farming Type 5 : Households’ revenue generated from business, wages and farming Type 6 : Full time farming Five types had access to grazing and arable land for agricultural purposes, but type two had not yet been granted the rights to graze or the use of arable fields for agricultural purposes by the village. The source of income for the households in type one was made up of welfare grants and remittances. Types three and four, mainly depended on pensions when compared to the other four types. The households in type five mainly received incomes from farming and business. In type six, the main income received was from farming. The most common modes of farming for the types were: garden-poultry- dry land- crop- cattle-sheep-goats. Using the data from the first questionnaire, the three active agricultural types were targeted with a production survey (28 households). The production survey revolved around animal production, but a number of questions had to do with general information concerning agriculture. From the survey, the households reported that the main aim for keeping livestock and chickens was self- consumption and sale of animals, except in the case of sheep, which were kept for wool production. In the case of the wool farmers, the committee controlled activities such as mating of animals, grazing management, shearing, dipping of animals and <b>wool</b> <b>sorting.</b> The other tasks were left to the farmer himself. Wool data obtained for 2001 indicated that the average fleece weight was 3. 88 kg greasy wool per sheep, with an A- to C- length. The fibre diametre of the wool in general fell in a medium class (21. 1 micron). From the survey a number of projects were identified to assist the rural farmers in improving the livelihood of the households and in securing food production and food security...|$|R
40|$|The largest wool {{exporter}} in {{the world}} is Australia, where wool being a major export is worth over AUD $ 2 billion per year and constitutes about 17 per cent of all agricultural exports. Most Australian wool is sold by auctions in three regional centres. The prices paid in these auction markets are used by the Australian production and service sectors to identify the quality preferences of the international retail markets and the intermediate processors. One ongoing problem faced by wool growers has been the lack of clear market signals on the relative importance of wool attributes with respect to the price they receive at auction. The goal of our research is to model the structure of Australian wool auction prices. We aim to optimise the information that can be extracted and used by the production and service sectors in producing and distributing the raw wool clip. Most of the previous methods of modelling and predicting wool auction prices employed by the industry have involved multiple-linear regressions. These methods have proven to be inadequate because they have too many assumptions and deficiencies. This has prompted alternative approaches such as neural networks and tree-based regression methods. In this thesis we discuss these alternative approaches. We observe that neural network methods offer good prediction accuracy of price but give minimal understanding of the price driving variables. On the other hand, tree-based regression methods offer good interpretability of the price driving characteristics but do not give good prediction accuracy of price. This motivates a hybrid approach that combines the best of the tree-based methods and neural networks, offering both prediction accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, there also exists a wool specifications problem. Industrial <b>sorting</b> of <b>wool</b> during harvest, and at the start of processing, assembles wool in bins according to the required wool specifications. At present this assembly is done by constraining the range of all specifications in each bin, and having either {{a very large number of}} bins, or a large variance of characteristics within each bin. Multiple-linear regression on price does not provide additional useful information that would streamline this process, nor does it assist in delineating the specifications of individual bins. In this thesis we will present a hybrid modular approach combining the interpretability of a regression tree with the prediction accuracy of neural networks. Our procedure was inspired by Breiman and Shang’s idea of a “representer tree” (also known as a “born again tree”) but with two main modifications: 1) we use a much more accurate Neural Network in place of a multiple tree method, and 2) we use our own modified smearing method which involves adding Gaussian noise. Our methodology has not previously been used for wool auction data and the accompanying price prediction problem. The numeric predictions from our method are highly competitive with other methods. Our method also provides an unprecedented level of clarity and interpretability of the price driving variables in the form of tree diagrams, and the tabular form of these trees developed in our research. These are extremely useful for wool growers and other casual observers who may not have a higher level understanding of modelling and mathematics. This method is also highly modular and can be continually extended and improved. We will detail this approach and illustrate it with real data. The more accurate modelling and analysis helps wool growers to better understand the market behaviour. If the important factors are identified, then effective strategies can be developed to maximise return to the growers. In Chapter 1 of this thesis, we present a brief overview of the Australian wool auction market. We then discuss the problems faced by the wool growers and their significance, which motivate our research. In Chapter 2, we define the predictive aspect of the modelling problem and present the data that is available to us for our research. We introduce the assumptions that must be made in order to model the auction data and predict the wool prices. Chapter 3 discusses neural networks and their potential in our wool auction problem. Neural networks are known to give good results in many modern applications resolving industrial problems. As a result of the popularity of such methods and the ongoing development of them, our research partner, the Department of Agriculture and Food, Government of Western Australia, performed a preliminary investigation into neural networks and found them to give satisfactory predictions of wool auction prices. In our Chapter 3, we perform an analysis and assessment of neural networks, specifically, the generalised regression neural networks (GRNN). We look at the strengths and weaknesses of GRNN, and apply them to the wool auction problem and comment on their relevance and usability in our wool problem. We detail the problems we face, and why neural networks alone may not be the best approach for the wool auction problem, thus laying the foundation for the development of our hybrid modular approach in Chapter 5. We also use the numerical prediction results from GRNN as the benchmark in our comparisons of different modelling methods in the rest of this thesis. Chapter 4 details the tree-based regression methods, as an alternate approach to neural networks. In analysing the tree-based methods with our wool auction data, we illustrate the tree methods’ advantages over neural networks, as well as the trade-offs, with our auction data. We also demonstrate how powerful and useful a tree diagram can be to the wool auction problem. And in this Chapter, we improve a typical tree diagram further by introducing our own tabular form of the tree, which can be of immerse use to wool growers. In particular, we can use our tabular form to solve the wool specification problem mentioned earlier, and we incorporate this tabular form as part of a new hybrid methodology in Chapter 5. In Chapter 4 we also consider the ensemble methods such as bootstrap aggregating (bagging) and random forests, and discuss their results. We demonstrate that, the ensemble methods provide higher prediction accuracies than ordinary regression trees by introducing many trees into the model. But this is at the expense of losing the simplicity and clarity of having only a single tree. However, the study of assemble methods do end up providing an excellent idea for our hybrid approach in Chapter 5. Chapter 5 details the new hybrid approach we developed as a result of our work in Chapters 3 and 4 using neural networks and tree-based regression methods. Our hybrid approach combines the two methods with their respective strengths. We apply our new approach to the data, compare the results with our earlier work in neural networks and tree-based regression methods, then discuss the results. Finally, we conclude our thesis with Chapter 6, discussing the potential of our new hybrid approach and the directions of possible future works...|$|R
