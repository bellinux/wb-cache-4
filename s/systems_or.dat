5|$|Opinions {{are divided}} {{as to where}} in {{biological}} evolution consciousness emerged and {{about whether or not}} consciousness has any survival value. It has been argued that consciousness emerged (i) exclusively with the first humans, (ii) exclusively with the first mammals, (iii) independently in mammals and birds, or (iv) with the first reptiles. Other authors date the origins of consciousness to the first animals with nervous <b>systems</b> <b>or</b> early vertebrates in the Cambrian over 500 million years ago. Donald Griffin suggests in his book Animal Minds a gradual evolution of consciousness. Each of these scenarios raises the question of the possible survival value of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Nødnett, Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on analog radio. The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. This was particularly problematic in larger disasters and accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate had also instructed the agencies to encrypt their communications for reasons of privacy. This would either have to be done through an expensive upgrade to the existing <b>systems,</b> <b>or</b> through the construction of a new, digital network.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{causes of}} the debt crisis varied. In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt {{as a result of}} banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. The structure of the eurozone as a currency union (i.e., one currency) without fiscal union (e.g., different tax and public pension rules) contributed to the crisis and limited the ability of European leaders to respond. European banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt, such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking <b>systems</b> <b>or</b> sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Monaco {{consists of}} up to four players who each control different characters while they partake in s and robberies in many different locations. Players can control one of eight characters, each of whom have their own characteristics, such as the Hacker who can put viruses onto security <b>systems,</b> <b>or</b> the Cleaner who can put guards to sleep.

5|$|Digital: A Love Story is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game, where the game's {{story is told}} primarily through text. The game is presented {{as if on a}} computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system (the name and visual appearance a reference to 1.x versions of AmigaOS). The player logs into bulletin board <b>systems,</b> <b>or</b> BBSs, where they read and reply to messages from other people. Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the computer screen. Accessing a BBS requires the knowledge of the telephone number for that board, which the player must type in manually. Boards that require a long-distance telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance calling card numbers found online. Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a user account for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system.|$|E
5|$|Foreign spiders have colonised {{areas where}} {{suitable}} habitat remains. The major coloniser is the South African spider Steatoda capensis. It was first {{reported in the}} 1990s and may have displaced the katipo along {{the west coast of}} the North Island from Wellington to Wanganui. Although both the katipo and S. capensis have been found sharing the same dune <b>systems</b> <b>or</b> even co-existing under the same piece of driftwood suggesting that the two species can co-exist in similar habitats. It is possible that the displacement of the katipo by S. capensis is due to its ability to recolonise areas from which the katipo had been displaced after storms or other dune modifications. Furthermore, S. capensis breeds year-round, produces more offspring and lives in a greater range of habitats which leads to greater pressure on the katipo. S. capensis also belongs to the family Theridiidae and shares many of the katipo's features. It is of similar size, shape, general coloration, it lacks the red stripe on its back, but may have some red, orange or yellow on its abdomen, as well as the general location where katipos are found. Due to these similarities it is commonly known in New Zealand as the ‘false katipo’.|$|E

5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is lower than {{approximately}} half a solar mass, it will never become hot enough to fuse helium in its core. It is thought that, over a lifespan that considerably exceeds {{the age of the}} Universe (c. 13.8 billion years), such a star will eventually burn all its hydrogen and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of helium-4 nuclei. Due to the very long time this process takes, it is not thought to be the origin of the observed helium white dwarfs. Rather, they are thought to be the product of mass loss in binary <b>systems</b> <b>or</b> mass loss due to a large planetary companion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification <b>systems</b> <b>or</b> checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E

5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, aircraft engines and windows during ash fall events. Roads may be closed to allow clean-up of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall. To prevent further effects on underground water <b>systems</b> <b>or</b> waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation of ash and to aid clean-up. Prioritisation of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute good management practice.|$|E
5|$|The pre-mission {{briefing}} {{stage is}} where the player gets information on the background and objectives, and selects the ship and weapons. The choices of ships and weapons increase as the player proceeds further along the campaign. Certain missions, however, will dictate certain ships and weapons to be used. Weapons can be classified into primary weapons and secondary weapons. Primary weapons are kinetic and energy weapons, while missiles and torpedoes are classified as secondary weapons. Each weapon has its own specifications such as its rate of fire. They also inflict different damages on hulls (body of the ships) or shields (the protective energy fields surrounding the ships), or possess special effects such as shutting down specific electronic <b>systems</b> <b>or</b> propulsion.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, {{mainframe}} {{computers and}} minicomputers were present in many academic research institutions and large companies such as Bell Labs. While the commercial video game industry did not yet exist at that point in the early history of video games and would not until the early 1970s, programmers at these companies created several small games to be played on their mainframe computers. Most of these spread only to other users of the same type of computer and therefore did not persist as older computer models were discontinued; several, however, inspired future games, or were later released in modified versions on more modern <b>systems</b> <b>or</b> languages. These early mainframe games were largely created between 1968 and 1971; while earlier games were created they were limited to small, academic audiences. Mainframe games also continued to be developed through the 1970s, but the rise of the commercial video game industry, focused on arcade video games and home video game consoles, followed by the rise of personal computers later in the decade, meant that beginning in the 1970s the audience and developers of video games began to shift away from mainframe computers or minicomputers, and the spread of general-purpose programming languages such as the BASIC programming language meant that later mainframe games could generally be run on personal computers with minimal changes, even if initially developed on a mainframe.|$|E
