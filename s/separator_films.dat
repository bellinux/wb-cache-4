Cell-level components for advanced lithium-ion batteries possessing higher energy, more reliable performance and enhanced, inherent safety characteristics have been under development within the NASA infrastructure. A key component for safe and reliable cell performance is the cell separator, which separates the two energetic electrodes and functions to inhibit the occurrence of an internal short circuit but preserves an ionic current.

40|$|Laser {{cutting of}} {{lithium-ion}} battery electrodes {{has been shown}} to be a viable alternative to mechanical blanking for some specific electrode types, yielding similar cut quality and throughput but with decreased on-going costs due to lower maintenance requirements. The multitude of electrode chemistries within the lithium-ion classification, particularly with regards to the cathode, together with the sensitive nature of battery components such as the polymeric <b>separator</b> <b>films</b> and electrodes themselves, requires careful assessment of defects for each electrode type. In the present work, cutting of LiNiMnCoO 2 (LNMC) coated aluminium cathodes and graphite coated copper anodes is performed at 100 mm/s with a 1064 nm pulsed fibre laser with 25 μm spot size, varying the pulse duration, energy and repetition rate over the ranges 4 - 200 ns, 8 - 935 μJ and 20 - 500 kHz, respectively. Process productivity is assessed in terms of the minimum cutting power at which complete electrode penetration takes place. A scanning electron microscope is utilised to assess upper coating layer clearance width and to determine the presence and dimensions of defects resulting from melting of the coating layers. Results are compared with previous cuts performed on LiFePO 4 (LFP), with differences observed in the parameters leading to minimum average cutting power and optimum quality between cathode types. Laser pulse fluence in the range 35 - 40 J/cm 2 with 30 ns pulse duration and 100 kHz repetition rate is found to lead to the highest cutting efficiency and quality for the LFP cathode, while 110 - 150 J/cm 2 fluence with 200 ns pulse duration and 20 kHz repetition rate is instead found to be ideal for the LNMC cathode and for the anode. The present on-going study indicates relatively strong sensitivities to electrode composition and laser pulse fluence for cutting efficiency and quality...|$|E

40|$|Continuing {{depletion}} of world’s {{fossil fuel resources}} has been a driving factor for seeking an ultimate goal of reducing heavy US dependence on fossil fuels by extensively investigating and developing alternative fuel sources and technologies including biorefinery use of lignocellulose biomass. Electrochemistry and electrocatalysis based technologies have great potential {{to be used in}} the next generation of biorefineries, part of developing sustainable technologies to mitigate global warming and lower dependence on fossil fuels. Electrical energy could be directly generated using electrochemical fuel cell reactors based on electrocatalytic conversion processes. This might be a promising green route to partially alleviating our energy dependence on traditional fossil fuel resources. Although great progress has been achieved in selective catalytic conversion of biorenewable compounds in heterogeneous catalysis, there is still a need to explore and develop electrocatalytic biorefineries to selectively produce valuable chemicals while simultaneously generating electricity. The research efforts described in this Ph. D. dissertation are divided into two parts: applied fundamental electrocatalysis research and practical direct biorenewable fuel cell technologies development. First, electrocatalytic oxidation of biorenewable polyols (C 3 glycerol and C 4 meso-erythritol) for valuable chemicals and electricity cogeneration has been investigated on supported Pd-based nanoparticle electrocatalysts in alkaline anion-exchange membrane fuel cells. PdAg bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst has been shown more efficient than Pd for alcohol oxidation due to Pd facilitating deprotonation of alcohol in a base electrolyte, while Ag promotes intermediate aldehyde oxidation and cleavage of C-C bond of C 3 species to C 2 species. A mechanistic understanding of electrocatalytic oxidation of glycerol and meso-erythritol and associated bond breaking on PdAg bimetallic catalysts has been developed, and the keys influencing product distribution and reaction pathways were further elucidated and controlled by optimizing electrocatalysts and reaction conditions. The second part of this dissertation describes the development of practical biorenewable fuel cells technologies focused on alternative “fuel” and inexpensive durable “cells” (device). A new route for directly using complex biomass derived bio-oil as an alternative fuel to generate electricity in alkaline membrane fuel cells has been explored. Electrochemical performance of bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass over precious metal monometallic catalysts such as Pt/CNT, Pd/CNT, Au/CNT, and Ag/CNT has been studied. In order to reduce costs and improve durability of fuel cell devices, the usage of porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) thin <b>films</b> as <b>separators</b> in high alkaline direct glycerol fuel cells has been thoroughly investigated.

40|$|Although much {{progress}} has been made to develop high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs), the reported physical or chemical routes to sulfur cathode materials are often multistep/complex and even involve environmentally hazardous reagents, and hence are infeasible for mass production. Here, we report a simple ball-milling technique to combine both the physical and chemical routes into a one-step process for low-cost, scalable, and eco-friendly production of graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs) edge-functionalized with sulfur (S-GnPs) as highly efficient LSB cathode materials of practical significance. LSBs based on the S-GnP cathode materials, produced by ball-milling 70 wt % sulfur and 30 wt % graphite, delivered a high initial reversible capacity of 1265. 3 mAh g- 1 at 0. 1 C in the voltage range of 1. 5 - 3. 0 V with an excellent rate capability, followed by a high reversible capacity of 966. 1 mAh g- 1 at 2 C with a low capacity decay rate of 0. 099 % per cycle over 500 cycles, outperformed the current state-of-the-art cathode materials for LSBs.

30|$|Supercapacitors {{with high}} power levels due to long cycle life, short time of charge/discharge and low cost are very useful in {{applications}} such as transport and energy recovery. In many industries with fluctuating loads, supercapacitors have increasingly {{played the role of}} the stabilizer for the power supply and voltage [1]. Supercapacitors are suitable for energy harvesting systems that are used to power an integrated circuit [2]. A large application of supercapacitors is needed in the transport such as power emergency actuators in airliners (doors and evacuation slides) and high specific power in military vehicles (radar, power supplies for laser and airbag, radio communications, etc.) [3, 4]. Supercapacitors are commonly used in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) as a fuel reduction of brake energy due to a number of favorable properties [5]. These include fast charge, longer lifetime, stable electrical properties and broader temperature range. A flexible supercapacitor is necessary for both portable and wearable electronic during folding and twisting conditions. A supercapacitor is made of two electrodes, an electrolyte and a separator that due to charge storage method divided into pseudocapacitors, electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and hybrid supercapacitors. The mechanism of charge storage in EDLCs is based on the energy storage at the electrode/electrolyte interface and depends on the contact surface between the electrolyte and electrode. The electrodes of EDLCs are made using metal oxides, lithium ion materials and conducting polymers. But currently due to large surface areas, lightweight, electrochemical stability and excellent conductivity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), activated carbon and graphene are widely used [6, 7]. The mechanism of charge storage in pseudocapacitors is based on the Faradic reactions (oxidation–reduction reactions), store energy near the surface and within the bulk of the electrodes [8]. The electrodes of pseudocapacitors are made using transition metal oxides and conducting polymers along with their composites. The lifetime of Faradaic capacitors is shorter than EDLCs. Hybrid supercapacitors combine pseudocapacitors with EDLCs using asymmetric electrodes [9]. In hybrid supercapacitors, one electrode contains a material that conducts a pseudocapacitors mechanism and at the second electrode, charge separation occurs due to EDLCs formation. Supercapacitor based on the electrolyte divided into gel-state electrolytes, solid-state electrolytes, and liquid-state electrolytes. Supercapacitors based on solid-state prevent leakage. There is normally a poor contact between the electrode and the electrolyte. Leakage is also an important problem in liquid-state electrolytes. Therefore, during the development of supercapacitors, the gel-state electrolytes are commonly used [10, 11]. Recently, carbon nanomaterials because of conductivity and other excellent features could replace charge collectors in supercapacitors. The larger specific surface area (SSA) of CNTs (430 – 1600  m 2  g− 1) as an electrode in supercapacitor displays the higher specific capacitance. The specific capacitance of CNTs greatly depends on the purity and the morphology of the electrode surface material [12]. The specific capacitance of purified CNTs is in the range of 20 – 80  F g− 1 and can be increased by the oxidative process [13]. The results of paper supercapacitor analysis based on multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) electrodes and electrolyte by H 3 PO 4 and PVA has been reported by Shieh et al. [14]. They showed the specific capacitance was 47  F g− 1. In Ref. [15], a flexible paper based on single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) supercapacitor with H 3 PO 4 /PVA electrolyte has been investigated. In their study, the specific capacitance was reported as 115  F g− 1. In another study, the paper supercapacitor with SWCNTs/graphene composites has been studied by Li et al. [16]. They reported the specific capacitance for SWCNTs as 36  F g− 1 and that for composites film as 100  F g− 1. Ping et al. [17] compared the 2 D graphene paper and the 3 D graphene foam electrodes and showed the specific capacitances were 82.9 and 128  F g− 1, respectively. A high-performance supercapacitor based on the fine sandpaper-based electrodes and a microporous separator coated with a H 3 PO 4 /PVA gel electrolyte and graphene/MWCNTs electrode has been reported by Yu et al. [18]. They showed that at the voltage scan rate 20  mV s− 1, the specific capacitance of the sandpaper-based supercapacitor was 55  F g− 1. Activated carbon is widely used for electrodes in supercapacitors due to its SSA (1000 – 3500  m 2  g− 1) and low cost. In Ref. [19], the specific capacitance of supercapacitor based on activated carbon electrode for aqueous electrolyte and organic electrolyte has been reported. They reported the specific capacitance based on an activated carbon electrode for aqueous electrolyte and organic electrolyte as[*] < 200  F g− 1 and [*]< 100  F g− 1, respectively. Saha et al. [20] reported the specific capacitance of supercapacitor based on mesoporous carbon as 102  F g− 1. There are different methods to synthesize the mesoporous carbons such as high-degree activation and carbonization of precursors and aerogels [21]. Paper with low cost and environmentally friendly is a suitable substrate for the advance of a flexible supercapacitor [22]. In this study, the fabrication of paper supercapacitor based on GNPs electrodes and gel electrolyte has been investigated. The PVDF and PVA/H 3 PO 4 were used as a gel electrolyte. The PVA/water and BaTiO 3 were used as a gel <b>separator</b> <b>film.</b> The different layer of the paper supercapacitors using TEM and SEM analyses has been characterized as well.

40|$|The {{search for}} new {{electrode}} and membrane materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has been under investigation to satisfy the ever-growing demands for better performance with higher energy density, improved safety and longer cycle life. In this study, electrospraying {{has been used to}} produce mesoporous thin films for the application as Li-ion battery separators. Electrospraying is a film formation technique that utilizes electrical rather than mechanical forces to form uniformly sprayed films. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was used to produce these thin membranes of thickness ranging between 20 and 25 microns. In this system, Polyethylene Oxide was incorporated as a sacrificial polymer. An ideal separator for LIB must be permeable and must have pore sizes ranging from 30 to 100 nm to facilitate good ion transport. In addition, a low thickness is required for high energy and power densities. Using this approach, we were able to achieve thinner and more porous membranes with pore sizes ranging from 0. 1 microns to 0. 3 microns. Silica precursors like PSSQ(Poly(silsesquioxane)) and OPSZ (Organopolysilazane) were incorporated into the film to increase the ionic conductivity of the membranes and thermal stability thereby increasing the battery performance. Results from SEM, BET, DSC, FTIR, Impedance Spectroscopy, Capillary Flow Analysis, Dynamic Mechanical Analysis of resulting mesoporous polymer/ceramic will be discussed. The battery tests reveal that mesoporous polymeric/ceramic <b>film</b> <b>separators</b> exhibit higher capacity and better capacity retention than polymeric/ceramic nanofiber separators.
