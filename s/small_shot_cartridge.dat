5000|$|In April 1940, Winchester {{introduced}} a special smoothbore version chambered for the [...]22 Long Rifle <b>shot</b> <b>cartridge,</b> featuring a 24 in barrel and bead sights {{identical to those}} used on the Model 12 shotgun.|$|R
50|$|The KBP OTs-20 Gnom ("Gnome") 12.5x40mm is a {{conventional}} large-frame revolver designed to fire cut-down 32-gauge full-brass shotgun shells. It fires the STs110 armor-piercing-core lead slug, STs110-04 hollow-point lead slug, and STs110-02 lead <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In September 1937, a smoothbore version {{intended}} for short-range varmint control was introduced, chambered for [...]22 Short, [...]22 Long, [...]22 Long Rifle, or [...]22 Long Rifle <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges</b> interchangeably. Other than {{the absence of}} rifling, it was largely similar to the standard model.|$|R
50|$|The shotgun is multicharged, with a tubular underbarrel {{magazine}} of 3-cartridge capacity. Reloading {{is provided with}} a removable fore-end. The presence of the special barrel rear projection on the frame combined with the rear sight gives the possibility of mounting an optical sight. The shotgun is intended for the amateur hunting with <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the United States, pen {{guns that}} can fire bullet or <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{and do not}} require a {{reconfiguration}} to fire (e.g., folding {{to the shape of}} a pistol) are federally regulated as an Any Other Weapon (Title II). They require registration under the National Firearms Act and a tax in the amount of five dollars is levied.|$|R
5000|$|Lancaster's pattern {{centerfire}} and pinfire [...]410 <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{first appeared}} in Eley Brothers Ltd. flysheets in 1857. By 1874, Eleys were advertising modern centerfire [...]410 cartridges. It appears to have become popular around 1900, although it was recommended as [...] "suited {{to the requirements of}} naturalists, and for such weapons as walking-stick guns", presumably for self-defense, in 1892 by W. W. Greener. [...] The first ammunition was 2.0 inches (50.8 mm) long, compared with the modern 2.5 and 3.0 in sizes.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Crocker was {{a little}} taken aback. She had not {{supposed}} that her sister had even this <b>small</b> <b>shot</b> in her locker.|$|R
50|$|Orpiment, as the Latin Auripigmentum, is {{mentioned}} by Robert Hooke in Micrographia for {{the manufacture of}} <b>small</b> <b>shot</b> in the 17th century.|$|R
5000|$|When {{loaded with}} <b>smaller</b> <b>shot,</b> a shotgun will not {{penetrate}} walls as readily as rifle and pistol rounds, making it safer for non-combatants when fired in or around populated structures. This {{comes at a}} price, however, as <b>smaller</b> <b>shot</b> may not penetrate deeply enough to cause an immediately incapacitating wound; those who recommend birdshot for minimizing wall penetration also suggest backing {{it up with a}} larger buckshot if the first shot fails to stop the threat.|$|R
50|$|A snapsvisa (Swedish, plural: snapsvisor) is a {{traditional}} Scandinavian drinking song which is often sung before drinking a <b>small</b> <b>shot</b> of spirit that is called a snaps.|$|R
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to express the fright, the screaming and yelling of those wretches upon this first volley. We killed six of them, and wounded eleven or twelve, I mean as we knew of; for, as they stood thick, and the <b>small</b> <b>shot,</b> as we called it, scattered among them, we had reason to believe we wounded more that stood farther off, for our <b>small</b> <b>shot</b> was made of bits of lead and bits of iron, heads of nails, and such things as our diligent artificer, the cutler, helped us to.|$|R
5000|$|... 12 gauge/70 mm {{standard}} shotgun buckshot ammunition loads. Listed {{here from}} largest to <b>smallest</b> <b>shot</b> size. Loads typically {{offered in the}} 70 mm length hull (many other loading options are available).|$|R
60|$|Bob quickly obeyed and {{revealed}} {{the tail of}} a large cobra disappearing among the improprieties. Jim ran to a rude cupboard where pistols and ammunition were kept, and began to load with <b>small</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|R
60|$|P. 219. [par. 106.] Clarendon. On {{the brow}} {{of the hill}} there were breast-works, on which were pretty bodies of <b>small</b> <b>shot,</b> and some cannon; on either flank grew a pretty thick wood.--Swift. Silly style.|$|R
50|$|With shotguns, the <b>smaller</b> <b>shot</b> load {{carried by}} a smaller shell {{increases}} {{the challenge of}} hitting targets, and therefore {{can be used as}} a handicap for a skilled shooter, or to increase difficulty when training.|$|R
5000|$|The 6-inch guns used [...] "non-fixed ammunition", that is, the {{explosive}} cartridge that propelled the shell was stored and loaded {{separately from the}} shell or <b>shot.</b> <b>Cartridges</b> were made of raw silk, and stored in wooden crates in a special high-security section of the underground magazine. There were five types of shell on the Fort Rodd manifest in 1897: High Explosive (Lyddite), Armour-piercing, Common Pointed (for non-armoured maritime targets), and Shrapnel. The other class of projectile (and the one most often fired) was a solid steel shot (without any cavity for explosives or fuses, it was cheapest to produce). The shells and shot all had the same service weight of 94 pounds (to simplify calculation of elevation and depression) and diameter of 6 in; therefore, lengths of the various types varied.|$|R
5000|$|To further complicate matters, special <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges</b> are {{available}} for typical handgun chamberings such as 9 mm Parabellum, [...]45 ACP, [...]38 Special/.357 Magnum, [...]44 Special/.44 Magnum, and [...]45 Colt, as well as [...]22LR. These rounds are either crimped in or in a plastic casing, replacing the bullet. These are not generally considered [...] "shot shells" [...] by shotgun users, and the patterning performance is questionable, since they are fired through rifled barrels. Thompson/Center has manufactured special pistol barrels in for their Contender frames in [...]38/.357, [...]44 and [...]45 Colt/.410 (.45/.410 Also available for T/C Encore frames) that have [...] "straight rifled" [...] chokes in them to reduce the spin of the shot column and produce better patterns, {{but they are still}} suitable only for pest control at very short ranges.|$|R

50|$|The Milkor Stopper is a riot gun {{used for}} riot control, {{designed}} {{to fire a}} 37/38mm or 40mm cartridge, {{which can be a}} 9mm Buckshot, Rubber ball buckshot, teargas canister, rubber <b>shot</b> <b>cartridge</b> or explosive. The weapon is simple to operate and all metal surfaces are treated with a coating for corrosion protection, plus long-life dry film lubrication. It fires one shot before reloading. It is a conventional single shot, break-open weapon (opening at the breech like an ordinary shotguns (not pump-action)) with a floating firing pin mechanism that ensures safety when accidentally dropped. As a security or assault weapon, it can be fired from the shoulder or like a pistol by hand. The components of the weapon are interchangeable (client dependent), providing a range of applications from Less Lethal 37/38mm to a 40mm Lethal weapon.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{will be no}} {{occasion}} for that, Dias. We have quite made up our minds to wait here for a week before starting on our next expedition, so if you will come over in four days that will be quite soon enough. You can overhaul the blankets and bags, and see that those good enough to keep are put in good repair, and those worn out replaced. We shall want quite as many stores as those we took last time, for {{there are very few}} villages except on the sea-shore, and we shall find difficulty in replenishing our stock. We shall have to buy double-barrelled guns in place of those we lost, but that we shall do ourselves. We have plenty of ammunition and cartridges for the rifles and pistols, but we had only a few <b>shot</b> <b>cartridges</b> left when we lost the guns." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's yon in the water? Deer, I do believe," [...] cried Jasper, quickly {{drawing the}} <b>small</b> <b>shot</b> from {{his gun and}} putting in a ball instead. [...] "Come, lads, we shall have venison for supper to-night. That beast can't reach t'other side so soon as we can." ...|$|R
50|$|Shotshells {{are loaded}} with {{different}} sizes of shot depending on the target. For skeet shooting, a <b>small</b> <b>shot</b> such as a No.8 or No.9 would be used, because range is short and a high density pattern is desirable. Trap shooting requires longer shots, and so a larger shot, usually #7½ is used. For hunting game, the range and penetration needed to assure a clean kill is considered. Shot loses its velocity very quickly due to its low sectional density and ballistic coefficient (see external ballistics). <b>Small</b> <b>shot,</b> like that used for skeet and trap, will have lost all appreciable energy by around 100 yd, which is why trap and skeet ranges can be located in relatively close proximity to inhabited areas with negligible risk of injury to those outside the range.|$|R
50|$|A <b>small</b> <b>shot</b> glass {{specifically}} marketed for kitchen use {{is graduated}} in units such as ounce and half ounce, teaspoons, tablespoons or possibly millilitres. They {{are useful for}} recipes that call for multiples of a smaller unit (e.g. several teaspoons), allowing the dispensing of the amount in a single measure.|$|R

5000|$|In 1868, Remington began {{offering}} five <b>shot</b> metallic <b>cartridge</b> conversions of the revolver in [...]46 rimfire. Remington paid a royalty fee to Smith & Wesson, {{owners of the}} Rollin White patent (#12,648, April 3, 1855) on bored-through revolver cylinders for metallic cartridge use. The Remington Army cartridge-conversions were the first large-caliber cartridge revolvers available, beating even Smith & Wesson's [...]44 American to market by nearly two years.|$|R
