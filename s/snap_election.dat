5|$|A <b>snap</b> <b>election</b> was called, with Bruce {{taking his}} case {{to the people that}} {{dramatic}} action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted would lead to a major economic crisis.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{reporting}} the election result, newspapers suggested that Diefenbaker would soon call another election and seek a majority. Quebec Tory MP William Hamilton (who would soon become Postmaster General under Diefenbaker) predicted {{on the evening}} of June 10 that there would soon be another election, in which the Tories would do much better in Quebec. The Tory government initially proved popular among the Canadian people, and Diefenbaker called a <b>snap</b> <b>election.</b> On March 31, 1958, the Tories won the greatest landslide in Canadian federal electoral history in terms of the percentage of seats, taking 208seats (including fifty in Quebec) to the Liberals' 48, with the CCF winning eight and none for Social Credit.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, the Hellenic Parliament did {{not approve}} the new President with the supermajority required, and so a <b>snap</b> <b>{{election}}</b> was called {{for the end of}} January 2015. A few days before the 2015 election took place, Tsakalotos was quizzed on Syriza's economic policies by a number of economists, debt campaigners and investment analysts at the London School of Economics. Tsakalotos said there was a need for fiscal space, meaning 6–7billion Euros a year to spend on an expansionary fiscal policy. He also said that they would cancel the austerity budgets already agreed with the European Union (EU) and International Monetary Fund (IMF), pay back the loans from the IMF and focus on rescheduling and writing off the loans from the EU.|$|E

5|$|Coatbridge is {{presently}} {{part of the}} burgh constituency of Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, electing one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Before the constituency's creation in 2005, Coatbridge lay in the Coatbridge and Chryston constituency. Hugh Gaffney of the Scottish Labour Party has been the MP since the 2017 <b>snap</b> <b>election.</b> For {{the purposes of the}} Scottish Parliament, Coatbridge forms part of the Coatbridge and Cryston constituency, which is represented by Fulton MacGregor of the Scottish National Party. Coatbridge is further represented by seven regional MSPs from the Central Scotland electoral region. A small part of the eastern fringes of the town forms part of the Airdrie and Shotts constituency which is represented by Alex Neil in the Scottish Parliament and Neil Gray in the Westminster Parliament, both of the SNP.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker was {{repeatedly}} {{a candidate for}} the PC leadership. He gained that party position in 1956, on his third attempt. In 1957, he led the Tories to their first electoral victory in 27 years; a year later he called a <b>snap</b> <b>election</b> and spearheaded them to one of their greatest triumphs. Diefenbaker appointed the first female minister in Canadian history to his Cabinet, as well as the first aboriginal member of the Senate. During his six years as Prime Minister, his government obtained passage of the Canadian Bill of Rights and granted the vote to the First Nations and Inuit peoples. In foreign policy, his stance against apartheid helped secure the departure of South Africa from the Commonwealth of Nations, but his indecision on whether to accept Bomarc nuclear missiles from the United States led to his government's downfall. Diefenbaker is also remembered {{for his role in the}} 1959 cancellation of the Avro Arrow project.|$|E
5|$|In a hung {{parliament}} {{where no}} party or coalition holds a majority, the monarch has an increased degree of latitude {{in choosing the}} individual likely to command the most support, though it would usually be {{the leader of the}} largest party. Since 1945, there have only been three hung parliaments. The first followed the February 1974 general election when Harold Wilson was appointed Prime Minister after Edward Heath resigned following his failure to form a coalition. Although Wilson's Labour Party did not have a majority, they were the largest party. The second followed the May 2010 general election, in which the Conservatives (the largest party) and Liberal Democrats (the third largest party) agreed to form the first coalition government since World War II. The third occurred shortly thereafter, in June 2017, when the Conservative Party lost its majority in a <b>snap</b> <b>election,</b> though the party remained in power as a minority government.|$|E

25|$|The 1984 {{election}} was called when Marilyn Waring told Muldoon {{that she would}} not support his government in the vote over an opposition-sponsored anti-nuclear bill. Muldoon, visibly drunk, announced a <b>snap</b> <b>election</b> on national television. There is debate over whether the {{election was}} necessary — Waring had not threatened to block confidence and supply, meaning that the government could still have continued on even if it had lost the anti-nuclear vote. Nevertheless, Muldoon appears to have wanted an election to reinforce his mandate (just as Sidney Holland sought and won a mandate to oppose striking dock-workers with the 1951 <b>snap</b> <b>election).</b>|$|E
25|$|The 2017 general {{election}} {{was held on}} 22 October. Prime Minister Abe called the <b>snap</b> <b>election</b> on 25 September, while the North Korea crisis was prominent in the news media. Political opponents of Abe say the <b>snap</b> <b>election</b> was designed to evade questioning in parliament over alleged scandals. Abe was expected to retain a majority of seats in the Diet. Abe's ruling coalition took almost {{a majority of the}} vote and two thirds of the seats. The last minute campaigning and voting took place as Typhoon Lan, the biggest typhoon of 2017, was wreaking havoc on Japan.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the power}} to call <b>snap</b> <b>elections</b> usually lies with the incumbent, they usually result in {{increased}} majorities for the party already in power having been called at an advantageous time. However, <b>snap</b> <b>elections</b> can also backfire on the incumbent and resulting in a decreased majority or even the opposition winning or gaining power. As {{a result of the}} latter cases there have been occasions in which the consequences have been the implementation of fixed term elections.|$|R
