5|$|In the New York media market, BVT {{sold the}} <b>syndicated</b> Millionaire to CBS's {{flagship}} station, WCBS-TV. In the season that had passed, WCBS' mid-afternoon schedule included the <b>syndicated</b> edition of NBC's Weakest Link, which aired at 4 pm from its January 2002 premiere. Joining Millionaire {{as a new}} <b>syndicated</b> series was a spinoff of The Oprah Winfrey Show hosted by Dr. Phil McGraw. WCBS picked up both series for 2002–03, with Dr. Phil serving as lead-in for the <b>syndicated</b> Millionaire, which was plugged into the time slot that Weakest Link had been occupying.|$|E
5|$|Both NBC {{versions}} and {{the weekly}} <b>syndicated</b> version were hosted by Art Fleming. Don Pardo served as announcer until 1975, and John Harlan announced for the 1978–1979 show.

5|$|In 2001, Millionaire {{producers}} {{began work}} on a half-hour daily <b>syndicated</b> version of the show, with the idea being that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network series which was still in production. ABC's cancellation of the network Millionaire ended that idea; however, the <b>syndicated</b> Millionaire still had enough interest to be greenlit and BVT sold the series to local stations for the 2002–03 season. The <b>syndicated</b> series nearly met the same fate as its predecessor, however, {{due in part to}} worries that stemmed from a decision made by one of its affiliates.|$|E

5|$|The daily <b>syndicated</b> {{version of}} Wheel premiered on September 19, 1983, {{preceded by a}} series of episodes taped on {{location}} at the Ohio State Fair and aired on WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio. From its debut, the <b>syndicated</b> version offered a larger prize budget than its network counterpart. The show came from humble beginnings: King World chairmen Roger, Michael, and Robert King could initially find only 50 stations that were willing to carry the show, and since they could not find affiliates for the <b>syndicated</b> Wheel in New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago, Philadelphia was the largest market in which the show could succeed in its early days. Only nine stations carried the show from its beginning, but by midseason it was airing on all 50 of the stations that were initially willing to carry it, and by the beginning of 1984 the show was available to 99 percent of television households. Soon,Wheel succeeded Family Feud as the highest-rated <b>syndicated</b> show, and {{at the beginning of the}} 1984–85 season, Griffin followed up on the show's success by launching a <b>syndicated</b> revival of Jeopardy!, hosted by Alex Trebek. The <b>syndicated</b> success of Wheel and Jeopardy! siphoned ratings from the period's three longest-running and most popular game shows, Tic-Tac-Dough, The Joker's Wild, and Family Feud, to the point that all three series came to an end by the fall of 1986. At this point, Wheel had the highest ratings of any <b>syndicated</b> television series in history, and at the peak of the show's popularity, over 40 million people were watching five nights per week. The series, along with companion series Jeopardy!, remained the most-watched <b>syndicated</b> program in the United States until dethroned by Judge Judy in 2011. The program has become America's longest-running <b>syndicated</b> game show and its second-longest in either network or syndication, second to the version of The Price Is Right which began airing in 1972. The <b>syndicated</b> Wheel has become part of the consciousness of over 90 million Americans, and awarded a total of over $200 million in cash and prizes to contestants.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} <b>syndicated</b> {{for the first}} time on September 21, 1998.

This made Friends the third-highest-rated off-network <b>syndicated</b> sitcom to air at that time, behind Home Improvement and Seinfeld.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Syndicate</b> {{series is}} a series of {{isometric}} science fiction video games created by Bullfrog Productions. There are two main titles in the series: <b>Syndicate</b> (1993/1994) and <b>Syndicate</b> Wars (1996), with an expansion pack for the former, Syndicate: American Revolt. A fourth <b>Syndicate</b> title was released in February 2012. In June 2013, Mike Diskett (lead on <b>Syndicate</b> Wars) launched a Kickstarter for a spiritual successor to the <b>Syndicate</b> series named Satellite Reign.|$|R
