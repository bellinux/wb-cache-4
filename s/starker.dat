25|$|During the {{communist}} era, travelling to the West {{was a long}} process for Hungarian citizens. The {{first step was to}} obtain an invitation, preferably from a relative in the country to be visited, and a promise of full financial support. With such an invitation, and assuming he could get a passport, a Hungarian could travel westwards once a year. However, in the absence of such an invitation, he could travel to the West only once every three years. The Communist-era visa restrictions restricted Hungarian artists and musicians since it hindered their ability to travel abroad. As a result, many chose to leave Hungary and settle in the West, such as famed cellist János <b>Starker,</b> who emigrated to the United States in 1948 because it was impossible for him to tour abroad with a Hungarian passport.|$|E

50|$|The {{story has}} a complex series of relationships. All is {{seen through the}} eyes of the journalist, Jack Burden, who admires <b>Stark</b> and even when disillusioned still sticks by him. <b>Stark's</b> {{campaign}} assistant, Sadie is clearly in love with <b>Stark</b> and wants him to leave his wife, Lucy. Meanwhile, <b>Stark</b> philanders and gets involved with many women, taking Jack's own girlfriend, Anne Stanton, as his mistress. When <b>Stark's</b> reputation is brought into disrepute by Judge Stanton (Anne's uncle), he seeks to blacken the judge's name. When Jack finds evidence of the judge's possible wrongdoing, a quarter century earlier, he hides it from <b>Stark.</b> Anne gives the evidence to <b>Stark,</b> who uses it against her uncle, who immediately commits suicide. Anne seems to forgive <b>Stark,</b> but her brother, the surgeon who helped save <b>Stark's</b> son's life after the car crash, cannot. The doctor eventually assassinates <b>Stark</b> after <b>Stark</b> wins an impeachment investigation. The doctor in turn is shot down by Sugar Boy, <b>Stark's</b> fawning assistant.|$|R
25|$|World War II created havoc {{not only}} for the general {{population}} of Europe but especially for the European artists and writers that opposed Fascism, and Nazism. Many important artists fled to North America, and relative safety in the United States. The art community in New York City in particular was already grappling with Surrealist ideas and several artists like Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, and Robert Motherwell converged closely with the surrealist artists themselves, albeit with some suspicion and reservations. Ideas concerning the unconscious and dream imagery were quickly embraced. By the Second World War, the taste of the American avant-garde in New York City swung decisively towards Abstract Expressionism with the support of key taste makers, including Peggy Guggenheim, Leo Steinberg and Clement Greenberg. However, it should not be easily forgotten that Abstract Expressionism itself grew directly out of the meeting of American (particularly New York) artists with European Surrealists self-exiled during World War II. In particular, Gorky and Paalen influenced the development of this American art form, which, as Surrealism did, celebrated the instantaneous human act as the well-spring of creativity. The early work of many Abstract Expressionists reveals a tight bond between the more superficial aspects of both movements, and the emergence (at a later date) of aspects of Dadaistic humor in such artists as Rauschenberg sheds an even <b>starker</b> light upon the connection. Up until the emergence of Pop Art, Surrealism can be seen to have been the single most important influence on the sudden growth in American arts, and even in Pop, some of the humor manifested in Surrealism can be found, often turned to a cultural criticism.|$|E
