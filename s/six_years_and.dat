5|$|One {{contentious}} {{point in}} Denholm-Young's article was his assertion {{that there was}} no mention of the Provisions of Oxford in the Mise of Lewes. This was an idea that John Maddicott strongly contested in an 1983 article. According to Maddicott, the provisions had been at the centre of Montfort's opposition over the last <b>six</b> <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> it was unlikely that he would give them up so easily. Nevertheless, Montfort showed willingness to negotiate the terms of the provisions. As such, the Mise of Lewes was a moderate document; Montfort wanted to avoid a repetition of the situation after the Mise of Amiens. Rather it was external circumstances outside of Montfort's control that led to the eventual failure of the negotiations between the royalists and the barons.|$|E
