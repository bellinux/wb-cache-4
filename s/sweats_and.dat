5|$|The two {{duplicate}} {{characters are}} Ippo and Mamoru Takamura. The two characters are weaker than their normal versions and are embodiments {{of parts of}} the original story. The weaker Ippo is {{the first version of}} the character available. He wears <b>sweats</b> <b>and</b> a T-shirt rather than the boxing trunks the other characters wear. This version is based on when Ippo began boxing and was training to fight his rival, Ichiro Miyata. The weaker Takamura has less muscle mass and looks ill. He is based on a fight in the manga when Takamura overdid his weight management.|$|E
5|$|The Mérens, {{like many}} {{mountain}} horses, is calm, docile and hardworking. The {{report of a}} comprehensive study on the heritability of the breed's temperament was published in Equ'idée in 2010. It is a versatile breed, and very hardy, able to live all year outside without suffering from the weather. Mérens {{are known for their}} endurance, agility and sure-footedness. They require very little care, and can survive on poor food, even when working. They are resistant to cold, but react poorly to heat. Mérens foals are often born in the snow, without human intervention, but are usually handled and accustomed to humans from an early age. They show increased resistance to the anticoagulant properties of some varieties of fern, the consumption of which can cause bloody <b>sweats</b> <b>and</b> blood in the urine in other horses.|$|E

These side effects normally preclude prescribing {{the drug in}} doses needed for full remission of schizophrenia, so {{it has to be}} combined with a more potent antipsychotic. In any case, blood pressure and EKG should be monitored regularly.|$|E

25|$|The body {{is remarkably}} good at hiding the {{symptoms}} {{and as a}} result people with RCC often have advanced disease by the time it is discovered. The initial symptoms of RCC often include: blood in the urine (occurring in 40% of affected persons at the time they first seek medical attention), flank pain (40%), a mass in the abdomen or flank (25%), weight loss (33%), fever (20%), high blood pressure (20%), night <b>sweats</b> <b>and</b> generally feeling unwell. When RCC metastasises, it most commonly spreads to the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, adrenal glands, brain or bones. Immunotherapy and targeted therapy have improved the outlook for metastatic RCC.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{theories}} for how the smallpox virus first reached the Stó:lō in late 1782. The first is that the disease came up from Mexico spreading with overland travelers, the second and more likely theory {{is that it was}} brought to the coast through trade routes with Europeans. It is estimated that the epidemic killed two thirds of the Stó:lō population, approximately 61%, within six weeks. During the epidemic traditional responses to illness, although effective for illnesses that were common to the area, likely make the outbreak worse. One method was gathering around the sick person’s bed to sing and pray. This exposed more people to the virus. Other practices included cleansing <b>sweats</b> <b>and</b> cold morning baths which would have shocked the infected person’s body causing more harm.|$|E
500|$|Tuberculosis (TB) is an {{infectious}} disease usually {{caused by the}} bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect {{other parts of the}} body. Most infections do not have symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night <b>sweats,</b> <b>and</b> weight loss. The historical term [...] "consumption" [...] came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.|$|E

500|$|Since its {{original}} popularity, neo soul has been expanded and diversified musically through {{the works of}} both American and international artists. The more popular neo soul artists of the 2010s included John Legend, Anthony Hamilton, Jill Scott, Maxwell, Amy Winehouse, Chrisette Michele, Leela James, and Raheem DeVaughn. DeVaughn has described himself as an [...] "R Hippy Neo-Soul Rock Star", viewing it as a reference to his eclectic musical style. In its 2010 issue on critical moments in popular music, Spin cited D'Angelo's Voodoo and its success as {{a turning point for}} neo soul: [...] "D'Angelo's pastiche of funk, carnal ache, and high-minded, Afrocentric rhetoric stands as neo-soul's crowning achievement. So unsurpassable that it'd be eight years before we'd hear from Erykah Badu and Maxwell again, while Hill and D'Angelo remain missing. But Alicia Keys, John Legend, and Cee-Lo picked up D's mantle and ran with it". Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club discerns [...] "a line of revelatory, late-period neo-soul albums" [...] with the releases of Maxwell's BLACKsummers'night (2009), Badu's New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh) (2010), Bilal's Airtight's Revenge (2010), and Frank Ocean's Channel Orange (2012). [...] In the 2010s, other neo soul acts included Fitz and The Tantrums, Mayer Hawthorne, Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night <b>Sweats,</b> <b>and</b> Amos Lee. [...] During the middle 2010s, neo soul acts saw chart success on various music charts, with songs by Fitz and the Tantrums, Nathanial Rateliff & the Night Sweats charting in the Billboard Alternative Songs charts.

500|$|Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly {{was also}} positive, writing that Beyoncé [...] "pants and <b>sweats</b> <b>and</b> grunts (except, you know, sexy-like), her voice {{climbing}} ever higher {{in search of}} an octave big enough to hold it". Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that [...] "" [...] if sung by anyone else, 'I Miss You' would be a thin wisp of a ballad, but Beyoncé allows her voice to crack at the right moments, moving tenuously, self-consciously through the soft, circular melody." [...] He concluded that songs like [...] "I Miss You" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] would earn deserved spots in [...] "the Beyoncé pantheon" [...] once fans take the time to grow attached to them. Andrew Unterberger of PopCrush praised the way Beyoncé delivers the line [...] "Why is that?", writing that it is [...] "a nice little nod to the confusion of heartbreak, and a rare, welcome glimpse of vulnerability for an artist who too often seems to have all of the answers." [...] Referring to [...] "I Miss You", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that [...] "the 80s influence is not always a bad thing." [...] He considered the song to be [...] "a woozy update of an old-fashioned slow jam", further stating that [...] "it is probably pushing it a bit to call it an R equivalent of Ariel Pink's hypnagogic pop, but there's something enveloping and dream-like about it." [...] Ian Walker of AbsolutePunk commented that [...] " [...] hollow beat and dismal synthesizers, allow Beyoncé and her morosely beautiful voice center stage. [...] Beyoncé delivers a believable performance effortlessly." [...] By contrast, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune was negative, writing that [...] " [...] easily overlooked with its forlorn keyboard and beat-box chintziness." [...] Similarly, Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan felt that the ballad is [...] "too-saccharine-for-its-own-good." [...] The Guardians critics Ben Beaumont Thomas and Rebecca Nicholson ranked [...] "I Miss You" [...] at numbers four and nine respectively on their lists of The 10 Best Tracks of 2011.|$|E
500|$|On March 30, 1995, Selena {{contacted}} Leonard Wong {{about the}} perfume samples {{he had made}} for her. According to Wong, Selena told him she would be meeting Saldívar {{the next morning to}} pick up the samples that had been stolen from her. The same day, she told another employee at the boutique she was expecting to fire Saldívar. At 7:30a.m. (CST) Friday, March 31, Selena rose from her bed, donned green workout <b>sweats,</b> <b>and</b> left for Saldívar's motel room. At the motel, Saldívar told Selena she had been raped in Mexico. Selena took her to Doctors Regional Hospital, where medical staff noticed Saldívar showed [...] "clear symptoms of depression." [...] Saldívar told medical staff she had bled [...] "a little". The staff noticed Selena angrily respond that Saldívar had told her the opposite, that she was bleeding copiously the day before. Nurse Carla Anthony informed Saldívar she needed to travel to San Antonio to obtain a gynecological examination because Saldívar [...] "was a resident of San Antonio, the hospital was in Corpus, and the rape occurred outside the country." [...] While driving back to the motel, Selena told Saldívar it would be best if they stayed apart for a while to avoid upsetting Quintanilla, Jr. According to Dr. Martinez, Selena had tried to contact him that morning but he could not speak on the telephone because he was performing surgery. At 10:00a.m. (CST), Quintanilla, Jr. contacted Pérez to determine the whereabouts of Selena; she was due to record a song at Q-Productions that morning and had not arrived. Pérez called Selena on her cellular telephone and reminded her of the scheduled recording. She told him she had forgotten the session and she was [...] "taking care of one last [...] business" [...] and would be at Q-Productions soon after. This was the last telephone call Selena answered and was the last time Pérez heard her voice.|$|E

[...] As part of her treatment, Goodrem undertook chemotherapy, which resulted in the loss of her hair, and radiation therapy. The news of her diagnosis made newspaper and television headlines and an outpouring of support was shown by fans and the general public alike.

2500|$|On {{a routine}} {{training}} ride near Boulder, Wellington suffered a serious bike crash on Saturday 24 September, exactly {{two weeks before}} the World Championships in Kona. She received severe road rash (equivalent to second- or third-degree burns) on her left leg and injuries to her left elbow and hip. Wellington described the pain as [...] "intense", much worse than the fractures she had suffered earlier in the year, but X-rays showed no broken bones. Her first attempt at training after the accident was on the following Tuesday when, despite a swollen, infected leg, she tried swimming. She could manage no more than two lengths, in pain she later described as [...] "excruciating". She had to be lifted out of the pool, and given crutches to enable her to walk; her boyfriend Tom Lowe and coach Dave Scott had to carry her back to her car. The next day, Wednesday, she was due to fly to Kona, but she preferred to remain in Boulder, close to the experts treating her. The infection was causing her fever and night <b>sweats,</b> <b>and</b> the hip pain had disturbed her running gait.|$|E
