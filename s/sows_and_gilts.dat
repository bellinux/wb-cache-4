50|$|Mycotoxins {{have been}} shown to be {{detrimental}} to <b>sows</b> <b>and</b> <b>gilts</b> by causing the female to retain a corpora lutea inhibiting cyclicity and causing a pseudopregnancy; as well as a constant exhibition of estrus, and infertility. Pregnant females produce litters that result in a higher number of stillborns, mummified fetuses, and abortions. Before breeding, ingesting mycotoxins mimics the action of estradiol-17β. Specifically, Zearonol is able to bind to tissues that contain estrogenic receptors that would normally bind to estrogen causing the female to exhibit constant estrus. Boars are also affected by ingestion of mycotoxins. Testis of the boar has been shown to undergo a reduction of size by 30%. This is due to a smaller than normal size of the epididymis and vesicular cords. However, testosterone production is not affected.|$|E

40|$|Piglet {{survival}} {{is a problem}} of great significance in pig production, affecting both animal welfare and economic aspects negatively. In Sweden it is illegal to use farrowing crates for sows on regular basis. To encounter this problem there is a proposal of an animal welfare program to allow the use of crates for <b>sows</b> during, <b>and</b> a number of days after, farrowing. The proposal aims to reduce piglet mortality and improve pig welfare. This present review aims to analyse how crating affects the welfare of <b>sows,</b> <b>gilts</b> <b>and</b> piglets as well as piglet mortality. The results shows that a lot of research have been done in the field, but studies on the effects of crating for a shorter period of time and under Swedish conditions are insufficient. Crating has a negative impact on sow welfare as it prevents the sow from preforming several natural behaviours. This concerns behaviours before, during, as well as after farrowing which indicates that crating even under a limited period around farrowing can reduce the welfare of sows. Regarding the welfare of piglets, crushing is more common when the sow is loose-housed in pens compared to when they are crated. Nevertheless other welfare problems accompany the use of crates, for example starvation and aggressive behaviour within the litter. Piglet mortality caused by other factors than crushing is however more common when the sow is crated compared with loose-hosed. Many factors seem {{to be involved in the}} problem on the subject of piglet mortality such as litter size, piglet vigour, environment, maternal care and caretaking routines. Some studies shows that crating does not affect the overall piglet mortality and this indicates that it is possible to accomplish low mortality rates with loose-housed sows. This review discuss the complexity of the use of crates and the need to find successful alternatives to be able to reduce piglet mortality without the use of crates, witch this review concludes, negatively affects the welfare of <b>sows,</b> <b>gilts</b> <b>and</b> piglets...|$|R

40|$|Sows at an established, mid-Western, 1, 250 sow farrow to finish, {{confinement}} swine operation had {{a sudden}} onset of abortions and were lethargic and off-feed on July 1, 2010. The disease, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), was suspected based on the sudden onset of clinical signs consistent with infection in a naive herd. Before the outbreak, regular serological monitoring of the sow herd for PRRSV every three months yielded negative results. On examination, clinical findings: in the sows, included abortions with mummies, stillbirths and weak piglets, lethargy and off-feed; in the piglets and nursey pigs, pneumonia and generalized lymphadenopathy. ELISA for serum antibody and PCR for serum antigen detection were used for diagnosis of PRRSV infection. At the onset of clinical signs, ELISA testing results were negative but PCR assays were positive, which confirmed an acute outbreak because the pigs were positive for viral antigens but seronegative for PRRSV antibodies. To control the outbreak, all piglets were moved off site {{as soon as they}} were weaned. During the first month, there was a 50 % mortality rate in the nursery pigs and a 30 % abortion rate among the <b>gilts</b> <b>and</b> <b>sows.</b> For <b>gilts</b> <b>and</b> <b>sows</b> that remained at the original location, autogenous killed vaccine was prepared and given intramuscularly and intranasally.

Seronegative gilts were also put into the original herd, which was used as a tool to monitor for persistence of the virus. By September, abortion rates were about back to the pre-outbreak levels, and the piglets remained healthy at birth. In retrospect, a PRRSV risk assessment conducted every 2 years before the outbreak concluded that the farm was at risk of a PRRSV outbreak because of certain gaps in biosecurity.

The annual culling rate for the sample averaged 50 %, but varied considerably between herds ranging from 15 % to 85 %. Culled females had produced an average of 3. 77 litters. Half of the females culled did not produce more than three litters. Reproductive failure accounted for 32 % of all removals. The average parity of the females culled in that category was only 2. 37 : almost 33 % were gilts. Failure to conceive represented 75 % of all females culled for reproductive failure. Proportionally, culling as a result of anestrus was higher in gilts. It accounted for 33 % of all gilts culled for reproductive failure which was twice as much as for sows. Inadequate performance accounted for 17 % of all removals. These sows had produced an average of 5. 11 litters. These results indicated that few animals were culled on the basis of first litter performance. Old age comprised 14 % of all removals and the average parity at culling for this category was 7. 11.

40|$|Swine Industry Day 1969 {{is known}} as Swine Day, 1969 Most recent {{laboratory}} and research station reports have indicated that 2, 2 - dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate (DDVP) (Shell Dichlorvos) fed at low levels to pregnant sows in late gestation favorably affects newborn pigs. A field study we reported last year showed no favorable effect among over 200 litters. More than 600 barrows were checked at slaughter and no difference was detected in slaughter age between pigs from treated or untreated sows. Trials reported here involve <b>sows</b> <b>and</b> <b>gilts</b> in the K-State research swine herd. Trial 1 was those farrowing in March; trial 2, those farrowing in May...|$|E
40|$|The data {{included}} {{records on}} 440 purebred <b>sows</b> <b>and</b> <b>gilts</b> of Duroc, Hampshire and Yorkshire breeding mated in all combinations to produce purebred and two-breed cross litters. A total of 119 purebred gilts (39 with purebred litters and 80 with crossbred litters) were slaughtered 30 -days postbreeding and their reproductive tracts evaluated for number of corpora lutea and early embryo development. Farrowing records included 89 purebred and 161 two-breed cross litters produced at the Ft. Reno Experiment Station {{during the spring}} and fall of 1971 and the summer of 1972. Reproductive failures (females not exhibiting estrus or open at slaughter or open at farrowing) amounted to 13. 4...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} the effects of a licensed live Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine, administered to <b>sows</b> <b>and</b> <b>gilts</b> on three commercial pig units experiencing clinical salmonellosis associated with S. Typhimurium or its monophasic variant. After vaccination, clinical salmonellosis resolved and shedding of S. Typhimurium declined markedly and persistently on all breeding or breedingfinishing units, during the one- to two-year monitoring period. On two finishing units supplied in part by one of the vaccinated herds, pigs from the vaccinated herd were less likely to shed Salmonella than those from non-vaccinating herds, and Salmonella counts in faeces were also lower from the vaccine-linked animals. Non-Typhimurium Salmonella serovars were isolated typically in fewer than 10...|$|E
40|$|Porcine {{epidemic}} diarrhea virus (PEDV) is {{an important}} pathogen that has a significant eco-nomic impact on the swine industry by imposing {{a high rate of}} mortality in suckling piglets. However, limited information on the productivity values of <b>gilts</b> <b>and</b> <b>sows</b> infected with PEDV is available. Here, we evaluate the productivity index in <b>gilts</b> <b>and</b> <b>sows</b> during the 1...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{production}} {{is among the}} riskiest production activities. Similarly to other branches of agriculture in animal breeding the finished product {{is the result of}} complex procedures. The biological-technological procedure, the creation of the product is affected by an outstanding number of environmental factors which also cause uncertainties. In the North Great Plain Region of Hungary, <b>sows,</b> <b>gilts</b> <b>and</b> slaughter pigs are produced on a corporate farm. The reliable operation data of this company provide a stable basis for and estimating future costs and revenue and their distributions. Monte Carlo methods are one of the generally accepted tools for modeling risks. The significant independent variables, their ranges and probability distributions, and the correlation between them were inputs to the model. The values of the variables were produced using a random number generator. The computer simulation was performed using@Risk (Palisade Corporation) software. The study concentrates on the factors affecting the number of offspring (piglets). Model inputs were the mating, mortality and farrowing rates; the costs and the income values based on these rates have been analysed as the output data of the model. pig production, computer simulation, Livestock Production/Industries, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods,...|$|R
40|$|Single {{injection}} of Prostaglandin F 2 a {{is able to}} induce parturition in sows. Earliest the 114 * pregnancy day in <b>sows</b> <b>and</b> 115 day in gilts is advisable for the PGF 2 o injection. The main effect of synchronization of parturitions in <b>gilts</b> <b>and</b> <b>sows</b> in group after PGF 2 o (Cloprostenol®) can get a higher perfection after an additionally {{injection of}} long-time Oxytocin analogue Depotocin®. After Depotocin ® the onset of parturition is more concentrated than without them or with only a single injection of natural Oxytocin. In the average the length of partuntion is reduced about 50 %. In sows there is no dependence to their body weight and their number of litter. Following treatment is recommendable for <b>gilts</b> <b>and</b> sows: 1 ml Depotocin ® (0, 4 mg Carbetocin) must be given 22 hours post PGF 2 a Cloprostenol ® in <b>gilts</b> <b>and</b> <b>sows</b> without parturition until this time (115. - 116. day of pregnancy). In comparison to spontaneous parturitions the biotechnical induction of parturition reduces the percentage of still-bom piglets per litter.
