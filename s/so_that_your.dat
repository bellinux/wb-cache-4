25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things to take into consideration when either trying to lose or put on weight is output versus input. It is important to know the amount of energy your body is using every day, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> intake fits the needs of one's personal weight goal. Someone wanting to lose weight would want a smaller energy intake than what they put out. There is increasing research-based evidence that low-fat vegetarian diets consistently lead to healthy weight loss and management, a decrease in diabetic symptoms as well as improved cardiac health.|$|E
2500|$|The book's main {{theme is}} about finding one's destiny. According to The New York Times, The Alchemist is [...] "more {{self-help}} than literature." [...] An old king tells Santiago that, [...] "when {{you really want}} something to happen, the whole universe will conspire <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> wish comes true." [...] This {{is the core of}} the novel's philosophy and a motif that plays all throughout Coelho's writing in The Alchemist.|$|E

2500|$|You {{wake up in}} {{the morning}} and find {{yourself}} back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. [...] in nine months he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} first {{election}} to the Senate, Lieberman was approached by incoming Majority Leader George Mitchell who advised him, [...] "Pick out two or three areas that you’re really interested in and learn them <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> colleagues know what you’re talking about...You’re {{going to have more}} influence even as a freshman than you think because you know there’s hundreds of issues and inevitably we rely on each other.” Recalling the conversation, Lieberman has said, [...] "that was true when I first came in, although you could see partisanship beginning to eat away at that. But {{at the end of my}} 24 years, it was really so partisan that it was hard to make the combinations to get to 60 votes to break a filibuster to get things done." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Holy One said, 'on Rosh Hashanah recite before Me [...] Sovereignty, Remembrance, and Shofar blasts (malchuyot, zichronot, shofrot): Sovereignty so {{that you}} should make Me your King; Remembrance <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> remembrance should rise up before Me. And through what? Through the Shofar.' (Rosh Hashanah 16a, 34b)" [...] This is {{reflected}} in the prayers composed by the classical rabbinic sages for Rosh Hashanah found in all machzorim where the theme of the prayers is the strongest theme is the [...] "coronation" [...] of God as King of the universe in preparation for the acceptance of judgments that will follow on that day, symbolized as [...] "written" [...] into a Divine book of judgments, that then hang in the balance for ten days waiting for all to repent, then they will be [...] "sealed" [...] on Yom Kippur. The assumption is that everyone was sealed for life and therefore the next festival is Sukkot (Tabernacles) that is referred to as [...] "the time of our joy" [...] (z'man simchateinu).|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, however, Emperor Taizong's crown prince Li Chengqian was {{becoming}} fearful because Emperor Taizong had greatly favored another son, Li Tai the Prince of Wei, and Li Tai was making designs on {{the crown prince}} position. [...] Li Chengqian therefore gathered a group of political and military officials around him to consider overthrowing his father, including his uncle Li Yuanchang (李元昌) the Prince of Han, his cousin Zhao Jie (趙節), and brother-in-law Du He (杜荷, Du Ruhui's son). [...] Hou's son-in-law Helan Chushi (賀蘭楚石), the commander of Li Chengqian's guards, was {{also part of the}} plot, and through Helan, Li Chengqian invited Hou to join the plot as well, as Hou agreed. [...] However, he was deeply disturbed by his own involvement, and he developed insomnia. [...] His wife sensed that something was wrong, and told him, [...] "You, Duke, are an important official of the state, so why are you acting like this? [...] If there is something you are doing wrong, you should report yourself <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> life can be spared." [...] However, Hou did not do so.|$|E

2500|$|In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus {{repeatedly}} {{spoke of}} forgiveness, [...] "Blessed are the merciful, for {{they will be}} shown mercy." [...] (NIV) [...] "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift {{there in front of}} the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift."

2500|$|In her {{well-known}} article [...] "A Defense of Abortion", Judith Jarvis Thomson {{argues that}} abortion is in some circumstances permissible even if the embryo is a person and {{has a right to}} life, because the embryo's right to life is overtrumped by the woman's right to control her body and its life-support functions. [...] Her central argument involves a thought experiment. [...] Imagine, Thomson says, that you wake up in bed next to a famous violinist. [...] He is unconscious with a fatal kidney ailment; and because only you happen to have the right blood type to help, the Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you and plugged your circulatory system into his <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> kidneys can filter poisons from his blood as well as your own. [...] If he is disconnected from you now, he will die; but in nine months he will recover and can be safely disconnected. [...] Thomson takes it that you may permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will kill him. [...] The right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of somethingthe use of your bodyto which he has no right. [...] Similarly, even if the fetus has a right to life, it does not have a right to use the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions against her will; and so aborting the pregnancy is permissible in at least some circumstances. [...] However, Thomson notes that the woman's right to abortion does not include the right to directly insist upon the death of the child, should the fetus happen to be viable, that is, capable of surviving outside the womb.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} the High Priest said a short {{prayer in the}} outer area. The Jerusalem Talmud taught {{that this was the}} prayer of the High Priest on the Day of Atonement, when he left the Holy Place whole and in one piece: “May it be {{pleasing}} before you, Lord, our God of our fathers, that a decree of exile not be issued against us, not this day or this year, but if a decree of exile should be issued against us, then let it be exile to a place of Torah. [...] May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that a decree of want not be issued against us, not this day or this year, but if a decree of want should be issued against us, then let it be a want because of the performance of religious duties. [...] May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that this year be a year of cheap food, full bellies, good business; a year in which the earth forms clods, then is parched so as to form scabs, and then moistened with dew, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> people, Israel, will not be in need of the help of one another. [...] And do not heed the prayer of travelers that it not rain.” The Rabbis of Caesarea added, “And concerning your people, Israel, that they not exercise dominion over one another.” And for {{the people who live in}} the Sharon plain he would say this prayer, “May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that our houses not turn into our graves.”.|$|E
