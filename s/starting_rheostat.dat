50|$|The first DC motor-starters {{were also}} {{completely}} manual, {{as shown in}} this image. Normally it took the operator about ten seconds to slowly advance the rheostat across the contacts to gradually increase input power up to operating speed. There were two different classes of these rheostats, one used for starting only, and one for starting and speed regulation. The <b>starting</b> <b>rheostat</b> was less expensive, but had smaller resistance elements that would burn out if required to run a motor at a constant reduced speed.|$|E
50|$|Class E.424, having DC type motors, {{and like}} all the Italian {{locomotives}} of the time, is a rheostatic-type locomotive; on <b>start,</b> a <b>rheostat</b> is connected in series to the motors and is gradually excluded as speed builds up allowing more current to flow to the motors; but unlike other rheostatic locomotives of that time, this is not achieved via the characteristic lever (Maniglione), but through an automatic system, called Avviatore Automatico, derived from contemporary first-generation ALe 790/880/883 EMUs.|$|R
40|$|The {{worked out}} stand {{is based on}} the basis of existed {{laboratory}} equipment for research of the different modes of asynchronous electric drive. For a management the modes of starting and braking with the Moeller microprocessor relay is used. The offered solution of modernization allows simultaneously to investigate work of electromechanical control system, realized on classic to the relay – contact base of management, and system, realized on a modern microprocessor equipment, and also to conduct the necessary tuning of stand constituents and investigate the transient of current slip-ring induction motoring. An equipment allows to put right and test the next modes: <b>rheostat</b> <b>starting</b> slip-ring induction motoring in the functions of time, reverses, dynamic braking. The worked out course of laboratory works allows to conduct timing of switching of degrees of resistances and construction of electromechanical descriptions slip-ring induction motoring and also to design his work using the SimPowerSystems libraries of МATLAB Simulink package. Creation of program algorithm and its realization as a EASYSOFT program environment are performed. Verification of rightness of the program writing and tuning of all program elements parameters are done. It is shown that the removal of the real current is in the phase of rotor (by means of digital oscillograph) and it is don’t the design comparison of its result...|$|R
