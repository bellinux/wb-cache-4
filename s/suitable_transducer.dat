40|$|A {{combined}} ultrasound and thermography defect {{detection system}} using a raster scanned Q-switched laser {{as a source}} of heat and ultrasound has been developed for identifying surface breaking defects. Heat is generated on a sample surface by a laser source and the resultant thermal image is examined by a thermal imaging camera. This can be done using a cw or a pulsed laser, but for ultrasonic generation a pulsed laser beam is required. When a defect is present, the flow of heat in the sample is disturbed and a change in shape of the thermal spot on the sample's surface can be detected. The pulsed laser beam generates simultaneously an ultrasonic wave that can be detected by a <b>suitable</b> <b>transducer,</b> which in this case is an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT). The presence of a defect changes both the amplitude and frequency content of the received wave.

The imprinted nanoparticles with a core-shell structure have selective molecular binding sites in the core and multiple amino groups in the shell. The model Au transducer surface is first functionalized with a self-assembled monolayer of 11 -mercaptoundecanoic acid. The 11 -mercaptoundecanoic acid is activated by treatment with carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide and then reacted with the core-shell nanoparticles to form amide bonds. We have characterized the process by studying the treated surfaces after each preparation step using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, contact angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The microscopy results show the successful immobilization of the imprinted nanoparticles on the surface. The photoelectron spectroscopy results further confirm the success of each functionalization step. Further, the amino groups on the MIP surface were activated by electrostatically adsorbing negatively charged Au colloids. The functionalized surface was shown to be active for surface enhanced Raman scattering detection of propranolol.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{methods of}} {{nondestructive}} testing find widespread application in industry. A {{vast majority of}} the defect characterization schemes using electromagnetic methods involve estimation of the size and/or shape of the defect {{on the basis of a}} one dimensional signal obtained by scanning the surface of the test specimen using a <b>suitable</b> <b>transducer</b> [1 – 3]. Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in the development of imaging techniques for characterizing defects. As an example, eddy current imaging methods involve a raster scan of the surface of the test specimen to obtain a two dimensional image whose elements represent the real or imaginary components or alternatively the magnitude or phase of the impedance of the eddy current probe [4, 5]. In the case of magnetostatic imaging methods, the specimen under test is scanned by a flux sensitive transducer such as a Hall probe. The image is obtained, typically, by treating the value of either the normal or tangential component of the flux density at each sample point as a gray level [6]. Inverse techniques proposed to date rely largely on phenomenological models for analyzing the images to obtain estimates of the size and shape of the defect [7 – 10]. Unfortunately, these techniques call for considerable computing resources...|$|E
40|$|Flow {{measurement}} {{using the}} differential phase technique has shown some promise. However, there are. certain problems {{that must be}} overcome in order for it to prove viable. These are the inherent ambiguity in phase and the temperature dependence. In theory, these problems can be overcome by using multiple frequencies. This inevitably leads to the necessary use of broadband ultrasonic transducers over the conventional narrowband ones. A relatively new material that can provide a broadband response, is the piezoelectric film, polyvinylidene fluoride. The focus of this thesis {{is to look at}} the design, construction, and testing of wetted transducers, using this piezoelectric film. The design stage looks at the theoretical response of a transducer pair, using a general three port network model. The model provides a means of choosing <b>suitable</b> <b>transducer</b> design parameters. Construction of the transducers is then performed to confirm the validity of the design. Several sets of transducers were constructed with different backing materials having different acoustic properties. The measured responses of each of the sets were compared to each other and to their models. From this, the final transducer design was selected, resulting in a broadband wetted ultrasonic transducer, of relatively low cost. Finally, the transducers were tested in the differential phase flow measurement system. The results showed some improvement over the previously used narrowband transducers. Unfortunately, temperature compensation and the elimination of phase ambiguity were not attempted, due to certain problems with the flow measurement system...|$|E

Further, an increasing desire to utilize fuels that are derived from renewable sources to help mitigate emission of greenhouse gases is requiring more flexibility of these systems. As a result, combustion systems are adopting an increasing array of sensors and controls to achieve the desired performance. 	The subject of this thesis {{is the development of}} a speed of sound (SOS) sensor for use in fuel flexible combustion systems. The goal is to facilitate the ability of the combustion system to self-tune to selected combustion characteristics, primarily the fuel stock. The fuel of primary interest is biogas, also known as digester gas, which is promoted by California’s energy policy as a renewable and carbon neutral fuel. In order to make such a system commercially available and help offset natural gas consumption with the underutilized fuel an inexpensive speed of sound sensor was developed to detect fuel compositions. The sensor was designed using acoustic attenuation models to select a <b>suitable</b> <b>transducer</b> for detection of the speed of sound. It was found that by detecting the speed of sound of a gas mixture up to two components from a gas mixture could be found.

Utilizing this speed of sound sensor would help reach ultra-low NOX emissions while operating at lean conditions...|$|E

The Laser Torsional Vibrometer relies on the mean speed of rotation of the component to produce a time resolved voltage analogue of the angular velocity. There are many cases of engineering interest however where a component undergoes an angular oscillation about an axis rather than a simple translation or rotation with a unidirectional angular velocity In modal analysis for example where rotational and translation motions are of equal importance the absence of <b>suitable</b> <b>transducers</b> means rotational mobilities are rarely measured [2].

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{the design of a}} {{biosensor}} system for detection of multiple cancer biomarkers. Accurate diagnosis and prognosis of cancer requires early detection. Equally important, though, is the measurement of biomarker-velocity and detection of multiple biomarkers. Early detection requires highly sensitive biosensors capable of detection at very low concentrations of target molecules. Biomarker-velocity can be measured by monitoring concentration of target molecule over a period of time. This requires a system which is very easy to use, fast, flexible, inexpensive and portable, thus enabling its ubiquitous presence at the point of care. For detection of multiplexed biomarkers, biosensors which easily lend to array configuration are required. Conventional techniques do not fulfill either all or some aspects of the requirements listed above. In this work, we present the design of a biosensor system, keeping in view the desired features described above, to achieve the ultimate goal of enabling ubiquitous presence of biosensor at the point of care. We focus on acoustic transducer based biosensors. The two fundamental components of design in an acoustic biosensor are the design of an acoustic transducer and the design of a novel electrical interface for the transducer. For transducer design, we introduce and present the design of a single structure, GHz range, multi-mode acoustic resonator. We present this as a <b>suitable</b> <b>transducer</b> for liquid phase biosensors, which is the preferred medium for sensing of cancer biomarkers. We explore the underlying physics and do experimental and theoretical characterization of this device. The transducer needs to be functionalized with a chemically sensitive layer which performs the molecular recognition of cancer biomarkers. We present the experimental exploration of a reversible and oriented immobilization based Histidine-Ni(2 +) interaction which used NTA as the chelator for anchoring onto the device. Then we discuss the microfluidic design to enable liquid phase operation. We used SU- 8 polymer barriers for liquid containment and addressed the challenges of making it compatible with ZnO based devices. An electrical interface is needed to excite and extract the sensor response. We have presented here a novel method to measure and track a resonator's response and extract its characteristic parameters. This method measures the wideband frequency response of the resonator with a much simpler setup as compared to conventional methods. We have proposed and demonstrated the use of a white noise signal as a viable signal for broadband excitation of resonator-based sensing platforms. We have also established, shown through simulation and prototype measurements, the feasibility of the proposed method. The accuracy and speed of the system can be further greatly improved by FFT-based digital implementation of the spectral analysis system. We have presented an example hardware implementation of FFT-based signal analyzer, and have discussed the hardware resources required for actual implementation in a chip form. Lastly we discuss the measurement protocol and sensor results for head and neck cancer and prostate cancer biomarkers. These results demonstrate the usability of the proposed sensor system for detection of cancer biomarkers. PhDCommittee Chair: William D.

40|$|The {{difficulty}} in obtaining the required density and smoothness of constructed pavement, establishing conformity between registered process input parameter and tested output of asphaltic concrete; couple with {{the effect of}} small change in aggregate gradation on the workability of asphaltic concrete just as inadequate compaction can result to moisture induced damage are the main factors that triggers this research. The research was therefore undertaken to improve means of measuring workability. The research was divided into three tasks. Task one was consideration of all the materials used in the research. Task two was undertaken to achieve the first objective which is development of an improved workability measuring device. The components were designed, fabricated and a <b>suitable</b> <b>transducer</b> was incorporated. In order to obtain the best paddle suitable for the device out of three types paddle configurations named A, B and C. Seven types of mixes were designed in accordance with (PWD) Malaysia’s specifications for road works. Marshall Mix design method was used to obtain the optimum asphalt binder content for the AC 14 gradation of three different aggregate fractions {{used to test the}} paddles. The first three mixes designed used bitumen of 80 / 100 penetration, while the other three mixes designed were identical gradation of bitumen 60 / 70 penetration and the last mix used the Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP). The RPM was set essentially to 5, and then adjusted to 10, 15, 20, 25 RPM. The device developed was used to blend the mixes at six different temperatures. Dry sieved aggregate, wet sieved aggregate and warm mix asphalt was used to assess the gradation of aggregate and the reliability of device operation. Task three was undertaken to achieve the second, third and fourth objectives. The first three mixes designed were used at different mixing temperatures 140 °C & 150 °C and 5 different compaction temperatures. It was found that Paddle B having speed of 10 RPM is suitable for the device because it provides a wide range of torques. For the second objective, {{it was found that the}} value of Torque is influenced by compaction, mixing temperature and gyration; there is however no significant relationship between torque; resilient modulus, Stability and Flow. Also, the research finding suggests that the higher the mixing temperature, the lesser the value of torque. Furthermore, it was found that the increase in gyration will result in the increase in the value of torque. For the third objective, the finding demonstrate that all the three proportions of the same nominal maximum aggregate size AC 14 yielded different values of torque. It was also found that the fine aggregate yields more torque (less workable). In addition, the range of torque for AC 14 is 12 kNm to 20 kNm; and that wet sieved aggregate mix yielded less torque than the dry sieved aggregates. Results for the fourth objective suggest that any increase in TSR at different levels of mixing and compaction will decrease the value of torque any value of torque above 17. 2 kNm is an indication of moisture-induced damage. It was recommended that the findings in this research be tested on a full-scale, flexible pavement construction...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{detection}} of microorganisms in the food, pharmaceutical, clinical medicine, environmental and agricultural industries {{is of the}} utmost importance. Unfortunately, the best current technology {{has been able to}} offer is detection times of several days for quantitative results. The development of conducting polymer films has led to an increase in research activity involving the use of these materials for the design and application of sensors. Their ability to undergo electrochemical switching between oxidised and reduced states, which is correlated with the movement of anions and cations, has seen conducting polymers successfully used to produce electrochemical responses for particular species of interest. Conducting polymers can also be used as a matrix for the immobilisation of biological components such as enzymes, proteins or antibodies. The immobilisation of these components adds specificity to the sensors. It the combination of a biological component, immobilised onto a <b>suitable</b> <b>transducer,</b> that is the basis of the expanding field of biosensor research. Recent successes in biosensor research have resulted in reduced detection times of the order of minutes or hours. The main disadvantage of these techniques however, has been the inability to successfully detect small viable numbers (3 ̆c 104 microorganisms/ml (mo/ml) in these short periods of time. The focus of this work was the development of a technique suitable for the rapid and quantitative {{detection of}} a particular microorganism, Listeria monocytogenes. Chapter 3 investigated the incorporation of an antibody into a conducting polymer matrix. A comparison of various immobilisation techniques including physical entrapment, co-immobilisation and covalent attachment of the biological component was undertaken. It was found that the covalent attachment method provided films with more reproducibility and sensitivity compared to those prepared by the other methods. In Chapter 4, an investigation into signal generation is described. Conventional electrochemistry and the comparison of two different resistometric methods were investigated. It has been suggested that resistance measurements offer greater sensitivity than amperometric or potentiometric detection methods, however this was found not to be true in this instance. A lack of reproducibility and a high detection limit was the limiting factor in this work, so an alternative signal generation method was considered. Conventional mediators were trialled to enhance the bioelectrochemical transfer of electrons from the microorganism to the transducer. This latter part of this chapter investigates the ability of ferricyanide, toluidine blue, uniblue and two anthraquinones to mediate the microorganism-electrode interaction. Toluidine blue was the only mediator tested where significant changes upon the addition of Listeria were observed. These changes were not proportional to concentration, making this technique non-ideal. In Chapter 5, a successful approach to the mediation of the bioelectrochemical process is described. This research has shown a water-soluble conducting polymer (polymethoxyaniline sulfonate (PMAS)) to be successful in mediating the electron transfer from a microorganism (Listeria monocytogenes) to a glassy carbon substrate. Graphical representation of the change in current, at a potential of + 0. 8 V, observed after the addition of the Listeria, showed a linear relationship between peak current and microorganism concentration. The detection limit of this technique has been determined to be between lOmo/ml and lOOmo/ml and a detection time in the order of a few minutes (3 ̆c 15 mins). The changes recorded in the electrochemistry can also be observed using UV-vis spectroscopy. Addition of the microorganism to the parent polymer results in changes absorbance being observed. Fractionating the polymer into eight separate molecular weight fractions between 1700 and 21000 amu gave spectra with different absorbance values resulting from the addition of the Listeria to each individual fraction. The uniqueness of the PMAS response has been confirmed by studies using another water-soluble conducting polymer, poly-pyrrole butane sulfonate. This water soluble polypyrrole showed no responses to the addition of the microorganisms using either electrochemistry or spectroscopy. It is suggested that the high sensitivity of this technique {{can be attributed to the}} unique nature of the PMAS. It is the interaction the microorganism and the conveyance of the electron processes along the polymer backbone that allows small viable numbers to be reproducibly detected...|$|E

We examine application of the proposed acoustic echolocation method when evaluating porous materials directly and indirectly.

Acoustic waves of high frequency suffer absorption during propagation and the analysis of this absorption has both theoretical and technical interest. The observed loss mechanisms in solids: thermal conductivity, thermoelastic relaxation, scattering, plastic flow, structural relaxation, anharmonic coupling and magnetic effects. Theoretical explanations of these various types of losses in single and polycrystalline solids and also in high polymers, such as in rubbers and plastics are given. For reliable measurements, <b>suitable</b> <b>transducers</b> and precision experimental techniques are essential. Ultrasonic generators such as magnetostrictive, piezo electric, and the recently developed multicrystalline ceramic transducers are described. The experimental procedures for the measurement of sound velocity and attenuation during propagation are broadly grouped into three classes, (a) Resonant methods, (b) Optical methods, and (c) Pulse techniques. Optical diffraction methods are extensively used for velocity measurement and for the determination of elastic and elasto-optic constants of solids, whereas the resonant and pulse methods are used for both velocity and absorption measurement. At megacycle frequencies, at present, the pulse technique is the only method for precision absorption measurement. The recent measurement of attenuation at low temperatures and the relation with 'dislocation' theory are discussed. Attenuation measurements lead to another practical application in the use of certain solids, as delay lines in radar systems and in devices for storing informations.

40|$|To {{assist in}} the {{development}} of mechanical structures which are subjected to dynamic loads, structural dynamic testing, using a test rig loaded by servo-hydraulic actuators to reproduce operational measured responses in the laboratory, may form an essential element of the development process. The input loads acting on the structure under operational conditions can in most cases not be measured directly, and instead the structural dynamic responses to these loads are recorded. The input forcing functions then need to be determined to effect a simulation of the operational conditions. With this work, a time domain based testing system has been developed to enable the reproduction of service-acquired dynamic responses on any actual full scale structure in the laboratory, taking into account the full multiple axis dynamics of the system. The system is able to determine the input forcing functions in such a way that, when applied to the teststructure, an accurate reproduction of the in-service measured responses are reproduced on the computer controlled laboratory test rig.

The test rig is excited with synthetic random inputs while simultaneously recording the responses to these inputs. Using the experimental input-output data, a dynamic model of the test system is found by using parametric dynamic system identification techniques. By using the service aquired vibration responses together with the dynamic model, the system inputs may be determined. A series of iterations around this first approximation finally provides a high degree of accuracy in the simulation. To prove the integrity of the developed system, it has been applied to a number of case studies using a variety of different engineering structures, and very accurate results were achieved.

40|$|The {{response}} {{characteristics of}} high sensitivity piezoelectric pressure <b>transducers</b> <b>suitable</b> {{for use in}} the plasma flow induced by megawatt-level electric discharges in low density (less than 1 Torr) gases are described. The uniquely designed probe records the initial impingement of a large magnitude total pressure pulse, followed by the flow of primary interest with order-of-magnitude smaller signals. Effects relating to probe and support accelerations, blast shielding and probe heating are evaluated and accounted for in a probe system with a sensitivity of 40 V/atm...|$|R
40|$|Piezoelectric {{materials}} are the active elements in e. g. ultrasound transducers and thus {{widely used in}} sensor and actuator systems. The rather recent addition to ultrasonic transducer {{materials are}} the so-called ferroelectrets, voided piezoelectric-active polymer films. One type among the most studied ferroelectrets is cellular polypropylene. The properties of ferroelectrets, such as low elastic stiffness, high piezoelectric activity, good matching with air makes them <b>suitable</b> as ultrasonic <b>transducer</b> material. Here, we demonstrate the controlled adjustment of the piezoelectric properties, especially of the resonance frequency of cellular polypropylene films by means of transducer-structure modifications...|$|R

This study is the first dealing with the application of US guidance for the psoas-compartment-block which is used to achieve lumbar plexus blockades. A pilot study was carried out to establish the US anatomy of the lumbar paravertebral region and its blood vessels. Moreover, <b>suitable</b> <b>transducers</b> and US frequencies were assessed. The feasibility of US imaging of the psoas-compartment was studied on healthy volunteers (N= 21) of varying body types (normal weight: N= 13; overweight: N= 5; obese: N= 3) in a first volunteer study. Additionally, the skin-plexus distances were measured. A second volunteer study (N= 21) was carried out to investigate the US anatomy of the paravertebral blood vessels by means of power Doppler sonography. The technique of an US guided approach to the psoas-compartment was tested on embalmed cadavers (N= 10) at the levels L 2 /L 3, L 3 /L 4 and L 4 /L 5. Accuracy and safety of this technique were verified by means of computed tomography (CT). Two coordinates (A and B) were established to assess the position of the needle tips by means of US and CT. In 112 / 126 investigations the psoas-compartment, except the lumbar plexus, could be delineated clearly. In 14 / 126 investigations a visualization of the psoas-compartment was unfeasible. The mean skin-plexus distances were 5, 8 +- 1, 3 cm at L 2 /L 3, 6 +- 1, 4 cm at L 3 /L 4 and 6, 1 +- 1, 3 cm at L 4 /L 5. Spearman's coefficient showed a correlation of 0, 87 (P< 0, 001) between body mass index (BMI) and skin-plexus distance. A linear regression analysis revealed the relationship between BMI and skin-plexus distances. In 126 US examinations of the paravertebral blood vessels the lumbar arteries (N= 21), their ventral (N= 57) and dorsal branches (N= 34) and the ascending lumbar veins (N= 52) could be depicted most frequently. In some cases the ascending lumbar veins showed diameters above 1 cm and a close proximity to the psoas-compart...|$|R
40|$|Random winding {{is widely}} used for the {{preparation}} of yarn packages used {{in a variety of}} textile processes. Ribboning caused by overwinding of yarn turns at certain places within the package is a basic problem encountered in this process. Standard random winders incorporate some means of ribbon breaking, which strictly speaking have limited effectiveness. The research reported in thesis was undertaken to realise a random winder capable of detecting the occurrence of ribboning, and taking the ribbon breaking action at these precise times, and thereby achieve 'active' ribbon breaking. Such a winder was realised by the addition of <b>suitable</b> <b>transducers</b> to a standard random winder, which could be controlled by a PC. Winding trials carried out using this equipment established the effectiveness of the concept and also the greater freedom from ribboning the method achieved in comparison with other available methods. Unwinding trials carried out by suitably modifying the winder for measuring yarn unwinding tension were also used to establish the effectiveness of active ribbon breaking. Preliminary experiments carried out on the above apparatus showed the possibility of constructing a Angle of Double Traverse (ADT) diagram on the VDU of the PC during winding operations, which could serve as a useful aid to follow the progress of the winding operation. It was very useful for showing the occurrence of major and minor ribboning in the wound package, and also for visually indicating the effectiveness of the ribbon breaking procedures. The diagram was of further use in studying the nature of package driving by the grooved drum. The case of driving a deformable body such as a yarn package on a comparatively non-deformable grooved drum is important for understanding how the package rotates without any obvious slipping. By varying the winding conditions, it was in fact shown that some measurable slip occurs, and these relationships were experimentally established. Computer simulation is useful to determine the stresses within a wound package, particularly as these cannot be measured using conventional techniques. The results of such a simulation carried out on a random wound package and the comparison of the results with those obtained for a precision wound package are also presented...|$|R
