5000|$|In {{patients}} with thoracic aortic disease involving the arch and descending aorta, {{it is not}} always possible to perform a completely endovascular repair. This is because head vessels of the aortic arch supplying blood to the brain cannot be covered and for this reason there in often an inadequate landing zone for <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> delivery. A hybrid repair strategey offers a reasonable choice for treating such patients. A commonly used hybrid repair procedure is the [...] "frozen elephant trunk repair". This technique involves midline sternotomy. The aortic arch is transected and the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> device is delivered in an ante-grade fashion in the descending aorta. The aortic arch is subsequently reconstructed and the proximal portion of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> device is then directly sutured into the surgical graft. Patients with anomalies of the arch and some disease extension into the descending aorta are often ideal candidates. Studies have reported successful use of hybrid techniques for treating Kommerell Diverticulum and descending aneurysms in {{patients with}} previous coarctation repairs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: This report {{describes}} {{our experience}} with endovascular <b>stented</b> <b>graft</b> repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms and other arterial lesions. Methods: Between September 1990 and April 1994, 57 patients {{were treated with}} endovascular <b>stented</b> <b>grafts</b> (50 with abdominal aortic aneurysms or iliac aneurysms; five with traumatic arteriovenous fistulas; one with an infected femoral false aneurysm; and one with a false aneurysm of the proximal right common carotid artery). The devices consist of either a Dacron or an autogenous vein graft sutured to a balloon-expandable <b>stent.</b> The <b>stented</b> <b>grafts</b> are placed through remote arteriotomies, advanced under fluoroscopic guidance to their predetermined sites, and secured into position. Results: Forty of the 50 endovascular <b>stented</b> <b>graft</b> procedures used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms or iliac aneurysms were considered successful, even though some secondary treatment was required in six patients (two open operations; four secondary endovascular procedures). The 10 failures include four early procedural deaths, one late procedural death, and five leaks. All five arteriovenous fistulas and the two false aneurysms were successfully treated with endovascular <b>stented</b> <b>grafts.</b> Conclusions: Although our experience with endovascular <b>stented</b> <b>grafts</b> has been promising, remaining problems require resolution, and further follow-up is needed. However, the potential advantages of these endovascular grafts warrant their continued evaluation. (J VASC SURG 1995; 21 : 549 - 57. ...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveFenestrated and {{branched}} {{endovascular devices}} are increasingly used for complex aortic diseases, {{and despite the}} challenging nature of these procedures, early experiences from pioneering centers have been encouraging. The objectives of this retrospective study were to report our experience of intraoperative adverse events (IOAEs) during fenestrated and branched <b>stent</b> <b>grafting</b> and to analyze the impact on clinical outcomes. MethodsConsecutive patients treated with fenestrated and branched <b>stent</b> <b>grafting</b> in a tertiary vascular center between February 2006 and October 2013 were evaluated. A prospectively maintained computerized database was scrutinized and updated retrospectively. Intraoperative angiograms were reviewed to identify IOAEs, and adverse events were categorized into three types: target vessel cannulation, positioning of graft components, and intraoperative access. Clinical consequences of IOAEs were analyzed to ascertain whether they were responsible for death or moderate to severe postoperative complications. ResultsDuring the study period, 113 consecutive elective patients underwent fenestrated or branched <b>stent</b> <b>grafting.</b> Indications for treatment were asymptomatic complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (CAAAs, n = 89) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs, n = 24). <b>Stent</b> <b>grafts</b> included fenestrated (n = 79) and branched (n = 17) Cook <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind), Ventana (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> (n = 9), and fenestrated Anaconda (Vascutek Terumo, Scotland, UK) <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> (n = 8). In-hospital mortality rates for the CAAA and TAAA groups were 6. 7 % (6 of 89) and 12. 5 % (3 of 24), respectively. Twenty-eight moderate to severe complications occurred in 21 patients (18. 6 %). Spinal cord ischemia was recorded in six patients, three of which resolved completely. A total of 37 IOAEs were recorded in 34 (30. 1 %) patients (22 CAAAs and 12 TAAAs). Of 37 IOAEs, 15 (40. 5 %) resulted in no clinical consequence in 15 patients; 17 (45. 9 %) were responsible for moderate to severe complications in 16 patients, and five (13. 5 %) led to death in four patients. The composite end point death/nonfatal moderate to severe complication occurred more frequently in patients with IOAEs compared with patients without IOAEs (20 of 34 vs 12 of 79; P < . 0001). ConclusionsIn this contemporary series, IOAEs were relatively frequent during branched or fenestrated stenting procedures and were often responsible for significant complications...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackgroundThe <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> {{used for}} {{endovascular}} abdominal aortic repair (EVAR) profited from many technological changes since their appearance. The {{objective of this}} study was to compare the medium-term results of the second- and third-generation <b>stent</b> <b>grafts.</b> MethodsThree hundred thirty-four patients treated by EVAR between 2005 and 2013 were included in this retrospective study. Demographic, anatomical, perioperative, and follow-up data were collected in a prospective way in an electronic database and compared between 2 groups. The preoperative angio-computed tomographies were all analyzed in depth on a suitable three-dimensional work station. Group 1 (n = 219) represented the patients treated by second-generation <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> (Medtronic Talent®, Cook Medical Zenith Flex®, Vascutek-Terumo Anaconda®, Gore Excluder low-porosity®) and group 2 (n = 115) represented the patients treated with third-generation <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> (Medtronic Enduring I and II®, Cook Medical Zenith LP®, Gore Excluder C 3 ®). ResultsThe mean follow-up was 42. 4 ± 26. 8 months with a longer duration in group 1 (52. 4 ± 27. 2 vs. 23. 2 ± 10. 9 months, P < 0. 0001). The patients of group 2 had significantly more risk factors and cardiovascular comorbidities (coronary disease, tobacco addiction, dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, chronic renal insufficiency). Anatomical characteristics were similar in the 2 groups, in particular regarding the iliac arteries which were significantly more calcified and had a smaller diameter in group 2. The rate of perioperative complications was similar in the 2 groups, in particular for complications related to the iliac axes (3. 7 % vs. 2. 6 %, P = 0. 96). During the follow-up, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the rates of survival, reinterventions, or endoleaks and the progression of the aneurysmal sac. ConclusionsThis study shows that third-generation <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> allow results comparable with those of the second-generation <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> in spite of more complex iliac anatomies. These results make it possible to expand the indications of EVAR to patients presenting more cardiovascular comorbidities without increasing the risk of complications in the short and medium term...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{introduction}} of aortic <b>stent</b> <b>grafting</b> {{in the treatment}} of thoracic aortic disease has pioneered unique treatment options and gained rapid clinical adoption despite a paucity of long-term outcome data. The purpose of this analysis is to examine all operations performed using thoracic aortic <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. MethodsA total of 502 operations involving thoracic aortic <b>stent</b> <b>grafting</b> were performed between April 1999 and April 2009. Patients were followed in a prospectively collected clinical perioperative registry, and long-term outcomes were determined from administrative data sources. Aortic pathologies included aortic aneurysm, acute aortic dissection (types A and B), hybrid arch repairs, reinterventions with additional stents, pseudoaneurysm, chronic type B dissection, traumatic transection, penetrating aortic ulcer, and other unique indications. ResultsPatients’ mean age at the time of thoracic endovascular aortic repair was 70. 1 ± 12. 4 years, and 51 % of the patients were aged more than 70 years. Some 41 % of patients were female, and the majority of patients (87 %) were hypertensive. Overall 30 -day mortality was 10. 1 %. Multivariable risk factors for 30 -day mortality included urgent/emergency, Stanford type A aortic dissection, perioperative spinal ischemia, type C aortic coverage, hybrid arch operation, aortic transection, chronic renal failure, and age. Neurologic complications included permanent complete or incomplete paraplegia in 17 patients (3. 4 %), reversible spinal cord ischemia in 26 patients (5. 1 %), transient stroke in 16 patients (3. 2 %), and permanent stroke in 23 patients (4. 6 %). Greater extent of aortic coverage was not associated with risk of spinal cord ischemia. Access complications, stroke, and endoleaks diminished with increased operative experience over time. Risk factors for late mortality included urgent/emergency indications, hybrid procedures, traumatic aortic transection, age, perioperative paralysis, and chronic renal failure. Patients undergoing <b>stent</b> <b>grafting</b> for type B dissection were more likely to survive than patients undergoing <b>stent</b> <b>grafting</b> for aneurysms or other indications. ConclusionsThoracic aortic <b>stent</b> <b>grafting</b> has evolved to be a viable option to complement, augment, or even replace traditional treatments for aortic disease.
