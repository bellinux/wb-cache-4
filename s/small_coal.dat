Its {{inhabitants}} were employed in agriculture on scattered local farms, hand loom weaving in their own homes, working in the local quarries or the <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> mines on Winter Hill Coal mining was on a very small scale. Nicholas Fish, Brooker and Company had a coal pit on Wilders Moor that was mentioned on the 1869 and 1880 mines lists. in 1896 the Rivington Moor Colliery employed two workers mining coal from the Mountain coal seam for own or local use.|$|E

Ferrous sulfate {{is a leading}} cause of stream {{pollution}} in the streams of Pennsylvania, but the small amounts found in the Copperas Rock area are not enough to cause a significant problem in Great Trough Creek. A small cave found near Copperas Rock is thought to have been carved out by early settlers who used the ferrous sulfate mordant to set dyes to homespun fabrics.|$|E

25|$|Another {{difference}} was geographic distance; although China and Europe had comparable mining technologies, the distances between the economically developed regions and coal deposits were vastly different. The largest coal deposits in China {{are located in}} the northwest, within reach of the Chinese industrial core during the Northern Song. During the 11th century, China developed sophisticated technologies to extract and use coal for energy, leading to soaring iron production. The southward population shift between the 12th and 14th centuries resulted in new centers of Chinese industry far from the major coal deposits. Some <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> deposits were available locally, though their use was sometimes hampered by government regulations. In contrast, Britain contained some of the largest coal deposits in Europe.|$|E
500|$|A new {{headgear}} {{and winding}} engine were {{built at the}} Deep pit shaft; ventilation was by means of two axial-type fans installed in an underground chamber. After 1947 a [...] tunnel [...] below ground level was driven to the Stuart Street Power Station, to provide coal direct from the colliery. A conveyor within the tunnel delivered 200 long tons (224 short tons) of <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> an hour to the power station's bunker. Most of the developments begun by Manchester Collieries were completed after nationalisation in 1947 by the National Coal Board (NCB). After modernisation and reconstruction, coal was extracted by longwall mining using coal-cutting machinery and conveyors. This type of mining creates a void or goaf into which the roof is allowed to collapse. At Bradford, which had no spoil heap, the goaf was infilled with spoil or waste. As there was insufficient spoil to fill the void, some was brought from other pits. The NCB incorporated the takes, or coal reserves, of Moston and Ashton Moss Collieries into the redeveloped Bradford Colliery. Moston was closed, but the shafts of Ashton Moss were retained for winding men and equipment.|$|E

Upon their arrival in the United States, the Savarino family first settled in eastern Ohio, in the <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> mining community of Harpersville, Smithfield Township, Jefferson County.

For that was the purpose of my journey, both by steamboat on the Thames, and by very dirty railway on the shore. To which last institution, I beg to recommend the legal use of coke as engine-fuel, rather than the illegal use of coal; the recommendation is quite disinterested, for I was most liberally supplied with <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> on the journey, for which no charge was made.

6000|$|Her {{history was}} peculiar. Mr. Stillwood, when a blase man about town, verging on forty, had first seen her, then a fair-haired, ethereal-looking child, {{in spite of}} her dirt, playing in the gutter. To his lasting self-reproach it was young Gadley himself, {{accompanying}} his employer home from Westminster, who had drawn Mr. Stillwood's attention to the girl by boxing her ears for having, as he passed, slapped his face with a convenient sprat. Stillwood, acting on the impulse of the moment, had taken the child by the hand and dragged her, unwilling, to her father's place of business--a <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> shed in the Horseferry Road. The arrangement he there made amounted practically to the purchase of the child. She was sent abroad to school and the coal shed closed. On her return, ten years later, a big, handsome young woman, he married her, and learned at leisure the truth of the old saying, [...] "what's bred in the bone will come out in the flesh," [...] scrub it and paint it and hide it away under fine clothes as you will.|$|E
6000|$|In those days--down {{to about}} 1840, it was {{customary}} to burn peat in the cottages, the first cost {{of which was}} about four and sixpence the wagon-load--as much as I should require to keep me warm for a month in winter; {{but the cost of}} its conveyance to the villages of the Plain was about five to six shillings per load, as it came from a considerable distance, mostly from the New Forest. How the labourers at that time, when they were paid seven or eight shillings a week, could afford to buy fuel at such prices to bake their rye bread and keep the frost out of their bones is a marvel to us. Isaac was a good deal better off than most of the villagers in this respect, as his master--for he never had but one--allowed him the use of a wagon and the driver's services for the conveyance of one load of peat each year. The wagon-load of peat and another of faggots lasted him the year with the furze obtained from his [...] "liberty" [...] on the down. Coal at that time was only used by the blacksmiths in the villages, and was conveyed in sacks on ponies or donkeys, and of those who were engaged in this business the best known was Old Joe. He appeared periodically in the villages with his eight donkeys, or neddies as he called them, with jingling bells on their headstalls and their burdens of two sacks of <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> on each. In stature he was a giant of about six feet three, very broad-chested, and invariably wore a broad-brimmed hat, a slate-coloured smock-frock, and blue worsted stockings to his knees. He walked behind the donkeys, a very long staff in his hand, shouting at them from time to time, and occasionally swinging his long staff and bringing it down {{on the back of a}} donkey who was not keeping up the pace. In this way he wandered from village to village from end to end of the Plain, getting rid of his <b>small</b> <b>coal</b> and loading his animals with scrap iron which the blacksmiths would keep for him, and as he continued his rounds for nearly forty years he was a familiar figure to every inhabitant throughout the district.|$|E

Their usual Whites are either {{artificial}} or natural White Lead, the last of which is the best they yet have, and with the mixing and tempering these colours together, are they able to make an imitation of any colour whatsoever: Their Reds or deep Yellows, they can dilute by mixing pale Yellows with them, and deepen their pale by mixing deeper with them; for it is not with Opacous colours as it is with transparent, where by adding more Yellow to yellow, it is deepned, but in opacous diluted. They can whiten any colour by mixing White with it, and darken any colour by mixing Black, or some dark and dirty colour. And in a word, most of the colours, or colour'd bodies they use in Limning and Painting, are such, as though mixt with any other of their colours, they preserve their own hue, and by being in such very smal parts dispers'd through the other colour'd bodies, they both, or altogether represent to the eye a compositum of all; the eye being unable, by reason of their smalness, to distinguish the peculiarly colour'd particles, but receives them as one intire compositum: whereas in many of these, the Microscope very easily distinguishes each of the compounding colours distinct, and exhibiting its own colour.|$|E
