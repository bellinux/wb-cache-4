It results from stenosis of the left subclavian artery proximal to the LIMA, which compromises myocardial blood flow. The incidence of CSS syndrome is between 0. 1 - 3. 4 % in the United States. 1 Most cases occur as a result of long-standing subclavian stenosis due to progres-sion of the stenosis following CABG.

40|$|Summary: We present {{two cases}} of <b>subclavian</b> <b>steal</b> syn-drome from the {{ipsilateral}} vertebral artery (VA) to the subclavian artery (SCA), {{one with the}} left VA originating from the aortic arch {{and the other with}} the left VA origi-nating very close to the origin of the SCA, proximal to the occluded segment.

Although color Doppler sonography is a safe method, diagnosis of SS has some difficulties in the presence of antegrade flow in the ipsilateral ver-tebral artery (VA).

50|$|<b>Subclavian</b> <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SSS), {{also called}} subclavian steal {{phenomenon}} or subclavian steal steno-occlusive disease, is {{a constellation of}} signs and symptoms that arise from retrograde (reversed) blood flow in the vertebral artery or the internal thoracic artery, due to a proximal stenosis (narrowing) and/or occlusion of the subclavian artery.

40|$|The <b>subclavian</b> <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{characterized}} by a subclavian artery stenosis located proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery. In this case, the subclavian artery steals reverse-flow blood from the vertebrobasilar artery circulation to supply the arm during exertion, resulting in vertebrobasilar insufficiency. As the vertebrobasilar arterial system feeds both the peripheral and central auditory and vestibular systems, in <b>subclavian</b> <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> neurotological symptoms are expected because of the vertebrobasilar insufficiency. In this report, we describe three patients suffering from <b>subclavian</b> <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> who presented with isolated dizziness, recurrent vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus.
