40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. This study {{concentrates}} {{on the relationship between}} the hardness of three different carbon/graphite brushes and the wear rate of the brushes and heat generated within a 400 Amp <b>starter</b> <b>generator.</b> The method being proposed was to alternate the <b>starter</b> <b>generator</b> from the starting mode and the generating mode, and run each carbon/graphite brush in the <b>starter</b> <b>generator</b> for a set time and document both wear rates and heat created. The study originated with a <b>starter</b> <b>generator</b> overheating during normal usage. The original hypothesis was that either excess carbon dust caused arcing, or the energy required to form the carbon dust was releasing too much heat, and thus the brush was too hard. The three carbon/graphite brushes chosen for this researched spanned the range of hardness for this type of material. This thesis analyzed the surfaces of the carbon/graphite brushes to correlate grooves and pitting with the frictional coefficient. An optical microscope, AFM, and SEM were used in the analysis of the surfaces. It was found that as the hardness of the brush went up, the wear rate decreased while the overall heat {{on the inside of the}} <b>starter</b> <b>generator</b> increased. From this research it is evident that the hardness of the brushes is the key factor in the excess heat in the <b>starter</b> <b>generator.</b> The energy that is expelled as heat as the carbon brush gradually wears is directly correlated with the increase of operating temperature. A harder brush will prolong the life of the brushes, but also increases the operating temperature to more than the unit is capable of handling...|$|E

50|$|This {{remained}} the business's name from foundation until 1967. This watch chronometer and instrument makers business {{was established by}} Samuel Smith in London in 1851. Their premises were in The Strand and they were watchmakers to the Admiralty. Retailing and wholesaling of Smiths-branded motor accessories was added in 1904 when a Watford supplier turned out Smith's first speedometer—The Perfect Speed Indicator. Growth was fast. Smiths began to manufacture {{some of their own}} motor products particularly speedometers. From mid-1913 all motor accessories activities were carried out from handsome purpose-built premises at Speedometer House, 179-185 Great Portland Street ("Motor Row"). The premises in the Strand became a Lyons tearoom but jewellers establishments were retained at Trafalgar Square and 68 Piccadilly. By this time motor accessories production included Smiths multiple-jet carburettors (designed by Trier & Martin), lighting sets, headlamps, sidelights, tail lights, dynamo and electric <b>starters,</b> <b>generators</b> and the Smith's Auto-Clear mechanical horn.|$|R

40|$|It is {{essential}} for manufacturers of aircraft electrical equipment to accurately model major components such as variable frequency <b>starter</b> <b>generators</b> (VFSG) prior to integration in an aircraft electrical power system. Although prior work exists on the theoretical approach for modelling motors and generators {{it is still a}} challenging problem for engineers to able to integrate complex electro-magnetic models such as VFSG in a simulation to enable behaviour and performance to be effectively and efficiently modelled in a simulator. A particular problem is the trade-off between simulation speed and accuracy when non- linear windings are considered, and this paper considers the impact of non-linear magnetic behaviour on the overall model of a synchronous generator when approximations such as the well known DQ 0 axis approach are used. This paper shows a hybrid approach to address this problem by including both winding non-linearities and a three stage VFSG model using DQ 0 axis transformations to ensure correct THD behaviour without using a full ABC approach...|$|R
40|$|The belt-driven-type {{integrated}} <b>starter</b> <b>generator</b> motor in {{a hybrid}} electric vehicle is vulnerable to thermal problems owing to its high output power and proximity to the engine. These problems may cause demagnetization and insulation breakdown, reducing the performance and durability of the motor. Hence, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate the thermal performance and enhance the cooling capacity of the belt-driven type Integrated <b>Starter</b> <b>Generator.</b> In this study, the internal temperature variations of the motor were investigated with respect to the operating parameters, particularly the rotation speed and environment temperature. At a maximum ambient temperature of 105 °C and rotation speed (motor design point) of 4500 rpm, the coil of the motor was heated to approximately 189 °C in generating mode. The harsh conditions of the starting mode were analyzed by assuming that the motor operates during the start-up time at a maximum ambient temperature of 105 °C and rotation speed (motor design point) of 800 rpm; the coil was heated to approximately 200 °C, which is close to the insulation temperature limit.
