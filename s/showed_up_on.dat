The surviving enemy planes flew down to the water level to evade further radar detection. These planestorpedo bombers and fighterssuccessfully ambushed the formation just minutes later. Evasive maneuvers, squall weather, and poor fighter cover {{on the part of the}} Japanese helped TG38.3 escape without suffering any significant damage.|$|E
5|$|In December 1995, Miceli {{signed with}} WCW, {{and as part}} of a storyline by booker Eric Bischoff, <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> WCW Monday Nitro on December 18, where she threw the WWF Women's Title belt into a trash can. She later {{admitted}} that she regretted the action and would not have done it had Bischoff not coerced her. Miceli immediately began using the Madusa name again, and the company brought in Bull Nakano to feud with her; they battled in a match at Hog Wild in August 1996. Due to pre-match stipulations, Madusa was allowed to destroy Nakano's motorcycle after the match.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1957, Stompanato visited Turner in England, where she was filming Another Time, Another Place (1958), co-starring Sean Connery. In her autobiography, Turner said that she {{arranged}} for Stompanato's visit because she was lonely and having a difficult time filming. Their reunion was initially happy, but the two soon began fighting. Stompanato became suspicious when Turner would not allow him to visit the set and, during one fight, he choked her, causing her to miss three weeks of filming. Turner later wrote {{that she and her}} makeup man, Del Armstrong, called Scotland Yard in order to have Stompanato deported. Stompanato got wind of the plan and <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the set with a gun, threatening her and her co-star Sean Connery, whom he warned to keep away from Turner. Connery answered by grabbing the gun out of Stompanato's hand and twisting his wrist, causing him to run off the set sheepishly. Turner and Armstrong later returned with two Scotland Yard detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying. The detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted {{him out of the house}} and also to the airport, where he boarded a plane back to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Promotion {{began in}} 1998, when Spears did a small tour in malls and food courts that were located mostly in larger {{cities around the}} United States and Canada. Each show lasted around thirty minutes, and Spears had two male dancers {{with her on the}} stage. The promo tour is also known as the L'Oreal Mall Tour, after its sponsor. The singer made several promotional {{appearances}} including talk shows and live performances around the world. On December 1998, Spears' first <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> MTV's and the Box's most-requested video charts. She also appeared on the Ricki Lake Show, the Howie Mandel Show, and was the presenter of the 1999 American Music Awards, prior to the release of the album. The singer also appeared on MTV's Spring Break and on the hundredth episode of Nickelodeon's All That. However, after hurting her knee, she had rescheduled appearances several shows such as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. After recovering, Spears embarked on another promotional schedule. The singer appeared on 12th Annual Nickelodeons Kids' Choice Awards on May 1, MTV's FANatic on May 12, Live with Regis and Kathie Lee on May 3, and The Rosie O'Donnell Show on May 25.|$|E

25|$|Having {{set their}} sights on A.C. Milan player Antonio Nocerino, D.C. United found their {{negotiation}} was undermined when Orlando City S.C.'s Kaka apparently convinced his former teammate to reject United's offer and pursue {{a contract with}} Orlando. Fortunately, a plan B quickly emerged. The team filled the holding mid slot by trading for MLS veteran Marcelo Sarvas, and got {{a bit of an}} unexpected boost when the name of a former acquisition target, Boca Junior's midfielder/forward Luciano Acosta suddenly <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the transfer rumor wires. Within a week, United had the diminutive midfielder signed and training in their Florida pre-season camp. The next day, Acosta even assisted on the lone goal in a match against Tampa Bay Rowdies. Reportedly, United agreed to a trade of a conditional draft pick to New York Red Bulls, who had gained discovery claim priority on Acosta, after United had relinquished its own. As preseason continued, the team released Conor Doyle {{to make way for a}} trialist from USL side Pittsburgh Riverhounds, winger Rob Vincent. United took to the pitch for the first time in 2016, with a 2015-16 CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinal series against Queretaro FC. In a match in the Mexican mountain city, D.C. United mostly held its own. But, missed chances by the visitors opened the door for the home team, which scored twice in the final 20 minutes, to take a daunting 2-0 lead in the series.|$|E

During preparations for Price's violent death scene, the director was overheard instructing Ogilvy to [...] "really lay into Vincent" [...] with the stage axe. Although when the scene was filmed Ogilvy indeed responded with blows that were not faked, Waddilove had earlier found some foam padding and fitted Price's costume with it, protecting the actor from any injury.|$|E
500|$|Gosford Park screenwriter Julian Fellowes {{contacted}} King {{to present}} ideas for a script, {{and according to}} the producer, [...] " [...] seemed to have the whole movie planned out in his head so we told him to go ahead and write it. Three months later, this incredibly impressive screenplay <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> our desks." [...] Fellowes was immediately hired by him and Scorsese. Fellowes chose not to end the film at Albert's death because he was wary of copying [...] "the horror of biopics," [...] where there is simply an important event after important event. Believing it had been done before and that the audience was already familiar with that part of Victoria's history, {{he thought it would be}} better suited for a television series or for another film.|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} {{continued with}} a welcoming video that featured famous chess players {{from around the}} world addressing the participants.

It was followed by a graphical show at the elevated chessboard that combined folk and modern dance, and was supported by video art projected on the area around and behind the stage. The show featured traditional carpet patterns and designs, embracing a dance group replaying the game of chaturanga. The next part of the ceremony was the parade of nations with the presentation of flags.

500|$|Gosling was {{scheduled}} to begin filming The Lovely Bones in 2007. However, he left the production two days before filming began because of [...] "creative differences" [...] {{and was replaced by}} Mark Wahlberg. Gosling had been cast as the father of the murdered teenage girl and initially felt he was too young for the role. The director Peter Jackson and the producer Fran Walsh persuaded him that he could be aged with hair and make-up changes. Before shooting began, Gosling gained 60 pounds in weight and grew a beard to appear older. Walsh then [...] "began to feel he was not right. It was our blindness, the desire to make it work no matter what." [...] Gosling later said, [...] "We didn't talk very much during the preproduction process, which was the problem ...

[...] Joel Meares of Time Out shared this view, adding that Minaj's rap verse was reminiscent of the times when Madonna's own songs were {{as good as the}} former's single [...] "Starships". The Village Voices Maura Johnston was also complimentary about Minaj, writing that, [...] " [...] lays down a couple of rhymes that are by no means the best in her vast catalog, but her sudden presence shows that the music isn't the song's biggest weakness." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club also considered the rapper's performance as [...] "one of her better features in a while", and better than her inclusion in the lead single [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'". Soderberg from Spin described the song as a [...] "rap track that positions Nicki Minaj, as the brash, pop subversive in the tradition of Madonna" [...] and criticized the latter's rapping, finding the vocals to be weak. Conversely, he appreciated Minaj's verses and vocal delivery, calling them [...] "witty" [...] and [...] "confident". He further wrote about Madonna's vocals in detail: ...|$|E
