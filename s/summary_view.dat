In 1787, Clarkson was {{attacked}} and nearly killed when visiting the city, as a gang of sailors was paid to assassinate him. He barely escaped with his life. Elsewhere, however, he gathered support. Clarkson's speech at the collegiate church in Manchester (now Manchester Cathedral) on 28 October 1787 galvanized the anti-slavery campaign in the city. That same year, Clarkson published the pamphlet A <b>Summary</b> <b>View</b> of the Slave Trade and of the Probable Consequences of Its Abolition.|$|E

25|$|Being descendents {{of divine}} unions with privileged mortals, mythical heroes are an {{intermediate}} group between gods and men, {{and they are}} sympathetic to human ambitions. Thus, for example, Pindar not only invokes Zeus for help {{on behalf of the}} island of Aegina, but also its national heroes Aeacus, Peleus and Telamon. Unlike the gods, however, heroes can be judged according to ordinary human standards and they are sometimes shown in the poems to demean themselves. Even in that case, they receive special consideration. Thus Pindar refers obliquely to the murder of Phocus by his brothers Peleus and Telamon ("I am shy of speaking of a huge risk, hazarded not in right"), telling the audience that he will not talk of it ("silence is a man's wisest counsel"). The Theban hero Heracles was a favourite subject but in one poem he is depicted as small in order to be compared with a small Theban patron who had won the pankration at the Isthmian Games: a unique example of Pindar's readiness to shape traditional myths to fit the occasion, even if not always flattering to the mythical hero. A hero's status is not diminished by an occasional blemish but rests on a <b>summary</b> <b>view</b> of his heroic exploits.|$|E

[...] Entitled [...] "Mémoire contenant le précis des faits, avec leurs pièces justificatives, pour servir de réponse aux 'Observations' envoyées par les Ministres d'Angleterre, dans les cours de l'Europe", a copy was intercepted in 1756, translated, and published as [...] "A memorial containing a <b>summary</b> <b>view</b> of facts, with their authorities, in answer to observations sent by the English ministry to the courts of Europe". [...] It used Washington's capitulation statement and other documents, including extracts of Washington's journal taken at Fort Necessity, to suggest that Washington had actually ordered the assassination of Jumonville. [...] But not all Frenchmen agreed with the story: the Chevalier de Lévis called it a [...] "pretended assassination". [...] The French story contrasted {{with that of the}} British account. [...] Based on Washington's report, the British suggested that Jumonville, rather than being engaged on a diplomatic mission, was spying on them. [...] Jumonville's orders included specific instructions to notify Contrecœur if the summons was read, so that additional forces might be sent if needed.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{the design of a}} data warehousing system for an engineering company `R'. This system aims to assist users in retrieving data for business analysis in an efficient manner. The structural design of this data warehousing system employs the dimensional modeling concepts of star and snowflake schemes. Furthermore, frequently accessed dimension keys and attributes are stored in various <b>summary</b> <b>views</b> (materialized views) in order to minimize the query processing cost. A cost model was developed to enable the evaluation of the total cost and benefit involved in selecting each materialized view. Using the cost analysis methodology for evaluation, an adapted greedy algorithm has been implemented for the selection of materialized views. This algorithm takes into account all of the cost variables associated with the materialized views selection method, including query access frequencies, base-data update frequencies, query access costs, view maintenance costs and the availability of the system's storage. The algorithm and cost model have been applied to a set of real-life database items extracted from company `R'. By selecting the most cost effective set of materialized <b>summary</b> <b>views,</b> the total cost of the maintenance, storage and query processing of the system is optimized, thereby resulting in an efficient data warehousing system 1...|$|R

From 1790 to 1802, in addition to holding various tutorships, he occupied himself with historical and philosophical studies. Finding little prospect of a career in Scotland, in 1802 he went to London, England, in company with Sir John Stuart of Fettercairn, then member of parliament for Kincardineshire, and devoted himself to literary work. From 1803 to 1806, he was editor of an ambitious periodical called the Literary Journal, which professed to give a <b>summary</b> <b>view</b> of all the leading departments of human knowledge. During this time he also edited the St James's Chronicle, belonging to the same proprietor. In 1804, he wrote a pamphlet on the corn trade, arguing against a bounty on the exportation of grain. In 1805, he published a translation (with notes and quotations) of An Essay on the Spirit and Influence of the Reformation of Luther, a C.F.

Effective user tools must support users in the task of interactively navigating and filtering data to identify items of interest and understand relationships between these items.

A compact browser for selecting items in a quasi-hierarchy illustrates relationships between items and supports selection of items from any level in the quasi-hierarchy. Multiple interoperating browsers for orthogonal quasi-hierarchies can be coordinated to form a powerful filtering interface useful for simultaneously drilling down from multiple perspectives.

40|$|OnLine Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a {{relational}} database technology providing users with rapid access to <b>summary,</b> aggregated <b>views</b> {{of a single}} large database, and is widely recognized for knowledge representation and discovery in high-dimensional {{relational database}}s. OLAP technologies provide intuitive and graphical access to the massively complex set of possible <b>summary</b> <b>views</b> available in large relational (SQL) structured data repositories. The capability of OLAP database software systems to handle data complexity comes at {{a high price for}} analysts, presenting them a combinatorially vast space of views of a relational database. We respond to the need to deploy technologies sufficient to allow users to guide themselves to areas of local structure by casting the space of 'views' of an OLAP database as a combinatorial object of all projections and subsets, and 'view discovery' as an search process over that lattice. We equip the view lattice with statistical information theoretical measures sufficient to support a combinatorial optimization process. We outline 'hop-chaining' as a particular view discovery algorithm over this object, wherein users are guided across a permutation of the dimensions by searching for successive two-dimensional views, pushing seen dimensions into an increasingly large background filter in a 'spiraling' search process.

Our proposed 'piling' metaphor presents a hybrid of these techniques, leveraging each one's advantages, as well as offering the ability to scale to networks with hundreds of temporal snapshots. While the MultiPiles technique is applicable to many domains, our prototype was initially designed to help neuroscien-tists investigate changes in brain connectivity networks over several hundred snapshots. The piling metaphor and associated interaction and visual encodings allowed neuroscientists to explore their data, prior to a statistical analysis. They detected high-level temporal patterns in individual networks and this helped them to formulate and reject several hypotheses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{technique}} for the optimization of (partially) bound queries over disjunctive datalog programs enriched with aggregate functions (Datalog ∨A programs). This class of programs has been recently {{proved to be}} well-suited for declaratively formalizing repair semantics in data integration systems. Indeed, even though disjunctive programs provide a natural way for encoding the possible repairs (i. e., insertions or deletions of tuples) of an inconsistent database, they do not suffice for applications in real scenarios, where users usually want to build <b>summary</b> <b>views</b> of data residing in different databases. The technique exploits the propagation of query bindings, and extends the Magic-Set optimization technique (originally defined for nondisjunctive programs without aggregate functions) to Datalog ∨A programs. All the algorithms presented in the paper have been fully integrated and implemented in the DLV system – the state-of-the-art implementation of disjunctive datalog. ...|$|R
