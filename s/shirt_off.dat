5|$|Takamatsu is {{an honor}} student who has a polite {{personality}} and wears glasses. He mainly contributes to the SSS through intelligence gathering and other affairs but does not actively fight. Yuri herself says to not be fooled by his glasses {{and that he is}} actually an idiot. Though appearing to be slender, he works out and is actually well-built muscle-wise. After he first reveals this, he tends to take his <b>shirt</b> <b>off,</b> much to everyone's discomfort. He is absorbed by a shadow and is turned into an NPC. However, having strong enough feelings (according to Yuri), he is able to regain his senses and manages to disappear like the others. He carries a Desert Eagle as a side-arm, but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E
5|$|In {{support of}} Kaleidoscope Dream, Miguel {{embarked}} on a short promotional tour in the United States on September 26, 2012. He also promoted the record with television performances on 106 & Park, The Wendy Williams Show, Late Show with David Letterman, and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. He subsequently toured {{in support of the}} album for six months throughout North America and Europe, including concert dates as a supporting act on Trey Songz' Chapter V World Tour during November 2012 to February 2013, and a headlining tour in the UK and Ireland during January 2013. Miguel opened for Alicia Keys on her Set The World On Fire Tour during March and April. Although he did not choreograph his shows, he routinely rehearsed in a dance studio and practiced singing in front of a mirror. In concert, he performed dramatic leaps, staggers, and other moves fashioned after Little Richard and James Brown. He started ripping his <b>shirt</b> <b>off</b> during performances after being inspired by Songz' concerts.|$|E
5|$|A German mutant with {{a strong}} Catholic faith and the {{appearance}} of a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. Nightcrawler can teleport through walls, but prefers to only teleport when he can see his landing site. On his body are many scarification marks, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts. At some point, Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role. Ultimately, the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting him since he speaks German fluently. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his <b>shirt</b> <b>off,</b> Cumming went through nine hours of makeup. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} the singer recalling {{memories}} from a hangover, including images of whiskey, a shoe in a chandelier, and her making out with a man flash on the screen, particularly getting a bottle of whiskey and drinking it with him. In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and the waitresses, where they drink champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes. As the video flashes white, it shows {{a glimpse of the}} other women's fantasies. Then, Lo becomes drunk, takes her <b>shirt</b> <b>off,</b> smears cake on her face, pours champagne on herself and starts to dance with her guests and the waitresses. In the following scene, she makes out with the man she was drinking with. The visual ends with the singer being at home while vomiting into a sink. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Lo in a dark room, with mascara dripping from her eyes while doing activities such as blowing bubble gum, eating melting ice cream, and smoking a cigarette.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a No Surrender Dog Collar {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the {{challenger}} Abyss, who was accompanied by James Mitchell. The encounter lasted 19 minutes and 17 seconds. In a Dog Collar match, both competitors are tied together at the neck by a long steel chain that {{is attached to a}} dog collar. The match is fought under no disqualification rules; in this case the only way to win was by pinfall. Abyss crashed through a table at ringside after Raven pushed him off the stage. Abyss removed the collar during the match and retrieved a bag of thumbtacks. He then poured them over the mat and ripped Raven's <b>shirt</b> <b>off,</b> before attempting to slam him into them. Cassidy Reilly interfered in the contest stopping Abyss. Later, Cassidy was shoved off the ring apron by Abyss and he crashed through a table. Raven followed by slamming Abyss back-first into the tacks with a powerbomb and covered for a near-fall. Abyss also gained a near-fall on Raven after slamming him into the mat back-first with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver. Raven finally won the contest following forcing Abyss head-first into thumbtacks with his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver to retain the championship. Following the bout, a segment took place between Raven and Jeff Jarrett, which ended when Rhino made his TNA debut and tackled Raven with his signature Gore maneuver.|$|E

50|$|Fielding's use of {{publicity}} stunts was commented on by The Sydney Morning Herald. in May 2008, he joined protesting pensioners, who brought traffic {{to a standstill}} in the Melbourne CBD, when he and others took their <b>shirts</b> <b>off</b> {{in the style of}} the cab drivers who had successfully stripped for increased cab security, to demand $70- to $100-a-week rise in the pension.|$|R

25|$|The band filmed a {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{depicting}} a teenage boy with bleached hair who is harassed by others. Wanting to fit in, he starts by cutting his hair short. He then takes his <b>shirt</b> <b>off,</b> and starts to cover himself with a black tar-like substance. He puts on a fly mask, as he continues to cover himself with the tar, with Durst watching him in the background with a disgusted look on his face. The boy then exits his room and comes down the stairs, now mutated {{into some sort of}} human fly. He enters the kitchen, where his family simply ignores him. He jumps onto the kitchen table, and begins to throw around the food on the table, while rubbing some into his face.|$|E
25|$|Over {{one hundred}} and twenty five {{communities}} donated their time {{to work at the}} canteen. Some people travelled as far as two hundred miles to take turns on regularly appointed days. The groups also took responsibility in supplying food for the day. If a group was too small, multiple ones would band together and help fulfill the daily requirements. Benefit dances, pie socials, and other activities were held to also help raise money for the canteen. Even the youth contributed to the workload, cleaning floors and raising money in all ways possible to support the troops. One girl remembers writing their addresses onto the packaging of popcorn balls so that the troops would have someone to write to. One twelve-year-old boy even sold his pets, toys, and the <b>shirt</b> <b>off</b> his back and donated the money to the cause. Even the railroad got into the giving by donating a dishwasher and coffee urns.|$|E
25|$|J.P. {{embraced the}} {{philosophy}} put forth in Jan Yoor’s book, “The Gypsies.” That philosophy of total freedom of actions, of non-ownership of possessions, defined {{his adult life}} and was far more revolutionary than most people could deal with. His incredible generosity (he would give the <b>shirt</b> <b>off</b> his back if he saw the need, and did so frequently), his deep love for his family and friends, the heart-felt music he composed and played as naturally as he breathed, all speak of a man committed to his desire to live life fully and without restraints. J.P. had a rascally sense of humor, though; another story he loved to tell was of the Romany Gypsy family that lived in the flat above the Pickens in San Francisco in early 1963. The father of the family would {{go out at night}} with a crowbar and smash fenders on cars parked along the street, then come along the next morning to offer to do the bodywork repairs. J.P. thought this was hilarious and told the story often with great relish.|$|E

500|$|Reviews {{were mixed}} in trade publications, with Paul's garb being {{cited as the}} weakest aspect by two {{different}} reviewers. Walton of The Moving Picture News, praised the film as a success, but did not provide any details as to why it was successful. The Moving Picture World provided a detailed review which praised the adaptation of the novel and found the staging and the acting to be clear and strong. The New York Dramatic Mirror review was negative, criticizing the garb, tempest scene, [...] and describing the acting as lacking in feeling. The Nickelodeon, an uncommon source for Thanhouser reviews, was not fooled by Crane's outfit. The reviewer said, [...] "It is usually good advice to tell a man to 'keep his shirt on,' but we decidedly advise the actor who played the part of Paul in this piece to take his <b>shirt</b> <b>off</b> {{the next time he}} essays the role of a child of nature whose costume consists principally of his own skin plus a few trimmings. Baggy underwear, where his skin ought to be, looks like the arch-fiend. ... The production was adequate up to the point of the tempest and shipwreck, which fell down deplorably. Better to have left it out all together. From here onward the photoplay adapters have departed from the original story, and maybe they were wise. Paul in his nude underwear would have spoiled Virginia's funeral." [...] The film is presumed lost.|$|E
