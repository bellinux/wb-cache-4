25|$|It {{might seem}} unusual that Hesiod's father {{migrated}} from Asia Minor westwards to mainland Greece, {{the opposite direction}} to most colonial movements at the time, and Hesiod himself gives no explanation for it. However around 750 BC or a little later, there was a migration of seagoing merchants from his original home in Cyme in Asia Minor to Cumae in Campania (a colony they shared with the Euboeans), and possibly his move west had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> since Euboea is not far from Boeotia, where he eventually established himself and his family. The family association with Aeolian Cyme might explain his familiarity with eastern myths, evident in his poems, though the Greek world might have already developed its own versions of them.|$|E

60|$|She {{began to}} {{speculate}} about that future life upon which religion insists so much and communicates so little.

Was all this world a mere make-believe, and would Miss Beeton Clavier and every one about her presently cast aside a veil? Manifestly there was a veil. She had a very natural disposition to doubt whether the actual circumstances of her life were real. Her mother for instance was so lacking in blood and fire, so very like the stiff paper wrapping of something else. But if these things were not real, what was real? What might she not presently do? What might she not presently be? Perhaps death had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> Was death perhaps {{no more than the}} flinging off of grotesque outer garments by the newly arrived guests at the feast of living?
