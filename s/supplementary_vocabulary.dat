40|$|This chapter {{takes as}} its point of {{departure}} the frequent injunction in Beckett’s late prose works to build or construct an environment for a character to inhabit. It is proposed that this instruction {{is central to the}} textual operations of the late prose. Making use of the work of Philippe Hamon on text and architecture, and through a close reading of Beckett’s short prose piece (originally written as a libretto for Morton Feldman), it is argued that, despite its sparse nature, ‘Neither’ can, in large part, still be read as exemplifying Hamon’s insights into the operations of the textual and the architectural as these were manifest in the classic realist novel. The specific challenges which Beckett’s late prose present, however, require a <b>supplementary</b> critical <b>vocabulary</b> in order to account for {{the manner in which the}} textual and the architectural interpenetrate and expose each other in the twentieth century...|$|R

This study {{examined}} how teachers perceive the incorporation {{and use of}} computer technology resources in language teaching through investigation of teachers’ attitudes and approaches to using an online <b>supplementary</b> resource in <b>vocabulary</b> instruction in an EFL context. The program offers such tools as vocabulary level tests, a vocabulary frequency profiler, word and text concordancer, and cloze text and hypertext builder. The aim {{of the study was}} to explore the factors that affect teachers’ use or non-use of the online program for teaching purposes. The study finally examined whether and to what extent opportunities, facilities, and training provided to teachers contribute to their acceptance and use of these resources. The data was collected through questionnaires distributed to 97 teachers in an English-medium university. Based on the results of the questionnaires, a stratified sample of 12 teachers was selected for follow-up interviews. The questionnaire results revealed statistically significant differences between teachers who have undergone computer technology training and those who have not in terms of their attitudes toward computers and the use of computer technology resources in language teaching. Follow-up interviews were used to determine whether positive attitudes or interests led people to undergo training or the reverse. The responses supported both cases for different individuals. The results also showed that simply introducing computer technology resources does not guarantee teachers’ use of these in practice. The provision of training is seen as a key factor in both changing attitudes and encouraging teachers in incorporating technology into their instruction. Arkın, Erkan İsmailM. S...|$|R
50|$|CPV {{codification}} {{consists of}} a main vocabulary which defines {{the subject of the}} contract, and a <b>supplementary</b> <b>vocabulary</b> to add further qualitative information. The main vocabulary is based on a tree structure made up with codes of up to 9 digits (an 8 digit code plus a check digit). This combination of digits is associated with a wording that describes the type of supplies, works or services defining the subject of the contract. A Call for Tender is quite often described by more than one CPV Code, aiming to give a better and more detailed description of the object of the contract. Commercial organisations promoting public contracts to their members or readers generally use CPV codes to identify business sectors likely to be interested in specific tenders, along with NUTS Codes which indicate the country and region within which the contract is to be performed.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} social tagging practice in science book context. In addition, it identified the usefulness of social tags as <b>supplementary</b> of controlled <b>vocabulary</b> to enhance the use of library resources. More specifically, this study examined to know to what extent the social tags match with controlled vocabulary, and whether or not any additional perception is provided by social tags to improve the accessibility and information retrieval in a digital environment. In both cases, the social tags were considered with respect to the appropriateness to the specific book. For the successful implementation of social tagging in library systems, there is a need to understand how users assign social tags to library collections, what vocabularies they use and how far the social tag relates to controlled vocabulary. This understanding can help libraries to decide on how to implement and review the social tagging. This study used a combination of both qualitative and quantitative research approaches. The LibraryThing website and Library of Congress Subject Headings were considered as a research site. Social tags have been collected from the LibraryThing website and LCSHs has been considered as controlled vocabulary. Twenty books from the science genre have been chosen purposefully. The sample has further been considered to include only those books that have also been available in the Library of Congress catalogue. Ten books have been taken from the academic group and the remaining were from the non-academic group. This study took into consideration only those social tags that occurred at least twice. A coding system has been developed to pull together all the similar social tags for further analysis. In the coding system, four broad categories have been defined, e. g., Social tags that match exactly with LCSHs, Social tags that match partially with LCSHs, Social tags that reflect bibliographic information and social tags that are user specific information. The last three categories were further sub-categorized. It is found that there is a clear difference between assigning expert created subject terms and social tagging practice to library books. Cataloguers assigned relatively few terms per book through the use of restricted and established vocabulary following firm rules, whereas, the end users enjoyed liberty with unlimited terms. More than fifty percent of social tags matched with expert created subject headings. The frequency of use of the social tags that matched with LCSHs terms was higher than the non-matched ones. The expert created subject headings were highly ranked in the social tags' lists, where end users more frequently assigned social tags that represented broader or narrower terms than the cataloguers’ assigned subject headings. In addition, the social tagging represented other aspects that could not be either covered within the strict subject headings assigned rules or cataloguing rules. Such diverse impressions can be seen as an access point to the same library collections according to users’ interest and opinions. This study revealed that as a standalone tool neither the controlled vocabulary nor the social tagging practice can work like a satisfactory information retrieval tool. A hybrid catalogue with combining both LCSHs and social tags would give its patrons the best of both worlds in terms of access to materials. This kind of practice may give more significant outcome for local research or university libraries where the users are more concentrated on a defined number of disciplines. Adapting users’ views in addition to controlled vocabulary through social tags may increase the efficiency of information retrieval process in library OPAC. This study implied both qualitative and quantitative support for the use of social tags in the library OPACs. The findings support many of the previous theories proposed in literature about social tagging and LCSHs. The qualitative analysis of social tags disclosed the diverse way of looking at the library resources by the end users in addition to subject descriptors. ...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{incidental}} L 2 vocabulary {{learning in}} a computer-mediated reading setting. The {{objective of the}} study is to determine the effect on lexical retentio~ of (1) computerised word-focused activities, (2) different types' of vocabulary learning activities, (3) frequency of word encounters, and (4) spacing between encounters. (Sixty intermediate-level Thai learners of English (forty-five distributed across four experimental groups, and fifteen in a no-treatment control group) participated in the four- week experimental study. Over two weeks, they read two texts in one of four conditions: with an interactive multiple-choice gloss (IMG) activity; with a vocabulary enhancement exercise (VEE) activity; with both vocabulary activities; and with no <b>supplementary</b> <b>vocabulary</b> activity. Three vocabulary tests (form-supply, meaning-supply, and form- meaning matching tests) were administered immediately after the final reading task and again two weeks later. The results revealed a significant positive impact of the word- focused activities, particularly on short-term retention (the immediate test). For longer- term retention (the delayed test), the benefit of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>vocabulary</b> activities remained effective, in conditions where the activities included the IMG. In addition, the combined activities were best resistant to word loss, while the IMG was potentially better at mitigating word losses than the VEE. The study further examines the combined effect of the number of word encounters (one or two occurrences) and the length of time between repetitions (close or wide spacing). The test scores show a significant relationship between number of encounters and short- and longer-term word retention. Words that occurred twice were remembered significantly better than those occurring once. It was also found that the timing of explicit focus in relation to the tests was important for word recall. Words that were explicitly focused on through the activities and tested on the same day were remembered significantly better than those that were not. However, the length of time between repetitions had no significant effect. The study discusses the facilitative role of word-focused activities, particularly the interactive multiple-choice gloss, and the benefit of multiple exposures in incidental vocabulary learning from reading. It also suggests ways to implement the activities in classroom teaching. Keywords: Incidental vocabulary learning, word-focused activities, vocabulary retention, interactive multiple-choice glosses, vocabulary enhancement exercises, frequency of word exposures, spacing effect.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find out the effect of using {{vocabulary}} flooding technique on Iranian EFL elementary learners’ vocabulary learning at the recognition level. A pretest-posttest control group design was used in this quasi-experimental research. The study was conducted at a secondary school in Sahand, a city located in the East-Azerbaijan province in Iran. Four intact grade-three classes were considered for the study. A KET test was administered and based on its results, two classes were selected as the homogenous ones, which were randomly assigned into the vocabulary flooding (experimental) and no vocabulary flooding (control) groups, each with 30 students. After the vocabulary recognition pretest, <b>supplementary</b> <b>vocabulary</b> teaching was used as the treatment in both groups. In the Experimental group, the target words were presented and practiced in flooding form, that is, in six or more sentences, while in the Control group, students were taught and practiced in only one sentence. After the treatment, two posttests (immediate and delayed) were conducted in both groups. The results of the One-way within-subjects and between-subjects Repeated-Measures ANOVA revealed that there were statistically significant differences within and between the experimental and control groups in the three vocabulary recognition tests. It was found that the participants’ receptive vocabulary knowledge was improved in the experimental group as a result of using vocabulary flooding technique. The implications are provided for the syllabus designers, textbook writers and EFL teachers...|$|E
40|$|The {{need to use}} {{technology}} to assist students in learning languages including English is undeniable. With its abilities, technology could help students learn English easily and effectively. One of the uses of technology in English learning is computer program. With its advantages, computer software can promote reading, writing, listening, grammar and vocabulary learning. Vocabulary software is one of computer-based software that has been widely used for young learners. However, the availability of vocabulary software in the market still needs developing, especially in Santo Yosef Elementary School in Surabaya. The vocabulary software in schools are limited on learning words in isolation accompanied with pictures, bilingual words (English – Indonesian) accompanied with pictures, and picture dictionaries. In these types of vocabulary software students do not have opportunities to learn words used in context (sentences). Learning words in isolation is not effective. Therefore, this study aimed at developing vocabulary software which provides {{opportunities for students to}} learn words in context so that they know how the words are used appropriately and {{will be able to use}} the words appropriately as well. The vocabulary software under this study was developed using ADDIE instructional design model, namely: (1) Analysis, (2) Design, (3) Develop, (4) Implement, and (5) Evaluate. The software was evaluated by experts, and was revised based on the experts’ feedback, comments, and suggestions. After being revised, the software was tried out to the students through a series of try out: individuals, a small group, and a large group (field try out). After each try out, the software was revised based on the results of the tryout. Based on the result of the final try out, it can be concluded that the developed software can be used as an appropriate <b>supplementary</b> <b>vocabulary</b> learning material for the students of Santo Yosef Catholic Elementary School in Surabaya...|$|E
