5|$|Bojić's matrilineal line traces {{its origins}} {{to the town}} of Tetovo, in what is now {{northern}} Macedonia. His mother's family had fled the town in 1690 as part of the Great Serb Migration and settled in Bečkerek (modern Zrenjanin). Bojić's maternal grandfather, Jovan, had lived in the border town of Pančevo <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child, married and started a family there. Much like Bojić's father, he was a successful shoemaker, and in 1890 he offered to marry his only daughter to him. After initial disagreement over the price of the dowry, Bogojević gave the marriage his blessing and Bojić's parents were soon married.|$|E

5|$|Imelda {{knew that}} her husband Ferdinand Marcos had dreamed of {{becoming}} {{the president of the}} Philippines ever <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> congressman. One reason why Marcos married Imelda, aside from her physical charms, was because she was a Romualdez—an aristocrat. Imelda's beauty, as well as her background, was appreciated to a great extent by Marcos and Marcos believed she would not only add light to his daily life but also to his political career.|$|E
5|$|Mézières {{had been}} fascinated by the American Old West <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little boy through {{exposure}} to Western genre films starring the likes of Gary Cooper, Burt Lancaster and James Stewart and comics such as Lucky Luke and Jerry Spring.

The film was meant to coincide with the 100 year anniversary of Muhammadiyah's founding.|$|E
5|$|While filming Diamonds Are Forever, Live and Let Die {{was chosen}} as the next Ian Fleming novel to be adapted because screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz thought it would be daring to use black villains, as the Black Panthers and other racial {{movements}} were active at this time. Guy Hamilton was again chosen to direct, and <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> jazz fan, Mankiewicz suggested he film in New Orleans. Hamilton did not want to use Mardi Gras since Thunderball featured Junkanoo, a similar festivity, so after more discussions with the writer and location scouting with helicopters, he decided to use two well-known features of the city, the jazz funerals and the canals.|$|E
5|$|Behan {{testified that}} when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight, he was not thorough, and that Tom {{might have had a}} pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan's {{testimony}} was significant, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> prime witness for the prosecution but had equivocated on this point. Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff, Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt.|$|E

5|$|Having been {{interested}} in aviation <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> boy, Plagis volunteered for the Southern Rhodesian Air Force (SRAF) soon after the outbreak of war in September 1939. He was turned down {{because he was the}} son of foreign nationals and therefore not a citizen, despite having lived in Rhodesia all his life. After Italy invaded Greece in late October 1940, bringing the Greeks into the war on the Allied side, Plagis applied again—this time to join the Royal Air Force, which had absorbed the SRAF in April 1940—and was accepted. Training first in Southern Rhodesia, then England, Plagis passed out with the rank of flight sergeant in June 1941 with above-average ratings in all of his flying assessments.|$|E
5|$|Acting on a {{tip from}} Strax, the Doctor visits the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes. He confronts Dr. Simeon and find a large glass globe in Simeon's office that {{contains}} psychic snow. The Doctor speaks to the Great Intelligence, the entity that has been speaking to Dr. Simeon <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> boy. He learns that the Great Intelligence has been controlling the snowmen and has taken interest in Latimer's pond. The Doctor visits the pond and deduces that the Great Intelligence is using the old governess' body as a DNA blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt. While Clara is putting the children to bed, the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house. The Doctor fights her off and is joined by Vastra, Jenny and Strax. Dr. Simeon arrives with more snowmen and tells them he wants the governess' ice body. The Doctor flees with Clara {{to the roof of}} the mansion and then to the TARDIS hovering overhead. They are pursued by the ice governess, whom the Doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals. Inside the TARDIS the Doctor gives Clara a TARDIS key, but the ice governess arrives and pulls Clara down off the cloud.|$|E
5|$|Well {{before the}} American victory at Buena Vista, {{political}} clubs were formed which supported Taylor for President. His support {{was drawn from}} an unusually broad assortment of political bands, including Whigs and Democrats, Northerners and Southerners, allies and opponents of national leaders such as Henry Clay and James K. Polk. By late 1846 Taylor's opposition to a presidential run began to weaken, and {{it became clear that}} his principles more closely resembled Whig orthodoxy. Still, he maintained that he would only accept election as a national, independent figure, rather than a partisan loyalist. Taylor declared, as the 1848 Whig Party convention approached, that he had always been a Whig in principle, but he did consider himself a Jeffersonian-Democrat. Many southerners believed that Taylor supported slavery and its expansion into the new territory absorbed from Mexico, and some were angered when Taylor suggested that if he were elected President he would not veto the Wilmot Proviso, which proposed against such an expansion. This position did not enhance his support from activist antislavery elements in the Northern U.S., as these wanted Taylor to speak out strongly in support of the Proviso, not simply fail to veto it. Most abolitionists did not support Taylor, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> slave-owner. Many southerners also knew that Taylor supported states' rights and was opposed to protective tariffs and government spending for internal improvements. The Whigs hoped that he put the federal union of the United States above all else.|$|E
