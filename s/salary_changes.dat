500|$|Relations {{have been}} {{turbulent}} between BA and Unite. In 2007, cabin crew threatened strike action over <b>salary</b> <b>changes</b> {{to be imposed}} by BA management. The strike was called off at the last minute, British Airways losing £80million. In December 2009, a ballot for strike action over Christmas received {{a high level of}} support, action was blocked by a court injunction that deemed the ballot illegal. Negotiations failed to stop strike action in March, BA withdrew perks for strike participants. Allegations were made by the Guardian newspaper that BA had consulted outside firms methods to undermine the unions, the story was later withdrawn. A strike was announced for May 2010, British Airways again sought an injunction. Members of the Socialist Workers Party disrupted negotiations between BA management and Unite to prevent industrial action. Further disruption struck when Derek Simpson, a Unite co-leader, was discovered to have leaked details of confidential negotiations online via Twitter. Industrial action re-emerged in 2017, this time by BA's Mixed Fleet flight attendants, whom were employed on much less favorable pay and terms and conditions compared to previous cabin staff who joined prior to 2010. A ballot for industrial action was distributed to Mixed Fleet crew in November 2016 and resulted in an overwhelming yes majority for industrial action. Unite described Mixed Fleet crew as on [...] "poverty pay", with many Mixed Fleet flight attendants sleeping in their cars in between shifts because they cannot afford the fuel to drive home, or operating while sick as they cannot afford to call in sick and lose their pay for the shift. Unite also blasted BA of removing staff travel concessions, bonus payments and other benefits to all cabin crew who undertook industrial action, as well as strike-breaking tactics such as wet-leasing aircraft from other airlines and offering financial incentives for cabin crew not to strike. The first dates of strikes during Christmas 2016 were cancelled due to pay negotiations. Industrial action by Mixed Fleet commenced in January 2017 after rejecting a pay offer. Strike action continued throughout 2017 in numerous discontinuous periods, resulting in one of the longest running disputes in aviation history. On October 31, 2017, after 85 days of discontinuous industrial action, Mixed Fleet accepted a new pay deal from BA which ended the dispute.|$|E

The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine whether a significant relationship existed between participation in a mentoring program and three measures of job success when analyzed by selected behavioral style variables. The study was an ex post factor field study which utilized 40 pairs of protected class lower-level managers. The two independent variables were mentoring and behavioral style. The three dependent variables were: percent of <b>salary</b> <b>change,</b> number of job rotations, and changes in promotability ratings [...] all measured over a one-year period. All subjects were employees of a large midwestern public utility. This company was selected because it had in operation a formal mentoring program for protected class managers. The experimental group consisted of the 40 mentees who had been in this company's formal mentoring program for approximately one year. The control group was matched subject-by-subject on seven demographic variables. The Level I: Life Styles Inventory was used to measure the participants' behavioral styles. These 12 LSI styles were then analyzed according to their four major quadrants: concern for task and satisfaction, concern for people and satisfaction, concern for people and security, and concern for task and security. The data were also analyzed according to task versus people and satisfaction versus security behavioral style orientation. All analyses were done by computer utilizing factorial analysis of variance. A significant interaction was found between group and style for the dependent variable of <b>salary</b> <b>change.</b> The task/satisfaction oriented mentored managers had a larger percent salary increase than the controls while the nonmentored managers with a people/security orientation had higher increases than the mentored. No significant main effects were found for <b>salary</b> <b>change.</b> For the second dependent variable, number of job rotations, no significant main effects nor significant interactions were found. A significant difference was found between the mentored and nonmentored groups on the promotability rating change index.

5000|$|When {{there is}} a good leader-member relation, a highly {{structured}} task, and high leader position power, the situation is considered a [...] "favorable situation." [...] Fiedler found that low-LPC leaders are more effective in extremely favourable or unfavourable situations, whereas high-LPC leaders perform best in situations with intermediate favourability. Leaders in high positions of power have the ability to distribute resources among their members, meaning they can reward and punish their followers. Leaders in low position power cannot control resources to the same extent as leaders in high power, and so lack the same degree of situational control. For example, the CEO of a business has high position power, because she is able to increase and reduce the salary that her employees receive. On the other hand, an office worker in this same business has low position power, because although they may be the leader on a new business deal, they cannot control the situation by rewarding or disciplining their colleagues with <b>salary</b> <b>changes</b> (Forsyth, 2006).|$|E

Yet, while public debate has considered the issue of merit pay plans for teachers, virtually no attention has been directed to the methods by which school administrators are compensated. This paper provides evidence on whether school superintendents are explicitly or implicitly rewarded for their "performance" by higher compensation and/or greater opportunities for mobility. We analyze panel data from over 700 school 'districts in New Ycrk State during the 1978 - 79 to 1982 - 83 period.

40|$|Executive {{compensation}} {{and its potential}} importance in aligning shareholder and management interests has been an extensively researched area within corporate finance. We study executive compensation while addressing several unresolved issues in the literature. In essay one, we examine CEO compensation following spin-offs. We find that CEOs are rewarded for undertaking a spin-off. Change in compensation for CEOs of spin-off firms following spin-offs is significantly higher than that for matching firms. We also find {{that the increase in}} compensation following spin-off is negatively associated with the change in firm size following the spin-off. Unlike mergers and acquisitions through which increases in executive compensation seem to be more related to size than performance, we show that CEO compensation increases following spin-offs even though spin-offs reduce firm size. In the second essay, we study changes in CEO salaries and their relation to firm performance. We document that changes in CEO salaries, which are a more permanent form of compensation change, are related to long term measures of performance. We find that CEO salaries change much more in relation to long term stock returns than short term stock returns. We also study the asymmetry in the relation between <b>salary</b> <b>changes</b> and firm performance. We find that while short term negative returns are related to changes in CEO salaries; only long term positive returns are significantly associated with CEO <b>salary</b> <b>changes.</b> This asymmetric relation is also present between total CEO compensation changes and stock returns. In essay three, we examine managerial decision horizons for target and acquirer firms in mergers and acquisitions. We find that acquirer CEOs have longer decision horizons than target firm CEOs in stock financed mergers. Acquirer CEOs in cash financed mergers and acquisitions also have longer decision horizons than target CEOs. Acquirer CEOs in both stock and cash financed mergers have significantly higher proportions of equity based {{compensation and}} significantly lower proportions of cash based compensation than target CEOs. In logistic regressions, measures of decision horizons for target and acquirer CEOs are not significantly related to the odds of stock financing in mergers and acquisitions.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} motives, behavior, and {{characteristics}} shaping mutual fund managers’ willingness to incorporate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues into investment decision making. Using survey evidence from fund managers from five different countries, we demonstrate that this predisposition is the stronger, the shorter their average forecasting horizon {{and the higher}} their level of reliance on business risk in portfolio management is. We also find that the propensity to incorporate ESG factors is positively related to an increasing level of risk aversion, an increasing importance of <b>salary</b> <b>change</b> and senior management approval/disapproval as motivating factors as well as length of professional experience in current fund and increasing significance of assessment by superiors in remuneration. Overall, our evidence suggests that ESG diligence among fund managers serves mainly as a method for mitigating risk and is typically motivated by herding; it is much less important {{as a tool for}} additional value creation. The prevalent use of ESG criteria in mitigating risk is in contrast with traditional approach, but it is in line with behavioral finance theory. Additionally, our results also show a strong difference in the length of the forecasting horizon between continental European and Anglo-Saxon fund managers...|$|R

40|$|Making use {{of unique}} {{balanced}} panel {{data for the}} German chemical sector from the years 2008 to 2011, we explore {{the extent to which}} managers' compensation was affected by the economic crisis {{and the extent to which}} it increased afterwards. Carrying out longitudinal analyses, we find that, on average, bonus payments (in contrast to fixed salaries) decrease considerably during the crisis. The economic upturn in 2011 then leads to an average increase in variable payments and total compensation to even above the pre-crisis level. Changes in bonus payments are negatively correlated over time. We find considerable differences across employees with respect to changes in bonus payments. Fixed <b>salary</b> <b>changes</b> are much more homogeneous over the period of crisis. We explore determinants of compensation changes and find that changes in compensation have a strong relationship with employees' age, firm size and hierarchical level. Our findings hint at the relevance of an incentive perspective. We also examine that certain parts of managers seem to have more power to influence their compensation than others. Inequality in managers' compensation decreased during the crisis...|$|E

To address the possible concern of <b>salary</b> <b>changes</b> being correlated with politicians ’ outside options, we implement a spatial discontinuity design using legislative district pairs straddling state borders, and obtain qualitatively similar findings to our other research designs (fixed-effects, selection-on-observables, and a narrative analysis). Despite limited impacts on performance, higher salary is significantly correlated with behavior on another margin, namely time-use; time-use data suggests that politi-cians in higher wage states spend greater time on fund-raising and on constituent services, but no more time on legislative activities.
