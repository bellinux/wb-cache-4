5|$|Disney {{settled on}} the film's concept as work neared {{completion}} on The Sorcerer's Apprentice, an elaborate Silly Symphonies short designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse, who had declined in popularity. As production costs grew higher than what it could earn, Disney decided to include the short in a feature-length film with other segments set to classical pieces. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in <b>stereophonic</b> sound.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Stereophonics</b> {{from nearby}} Cwmaman {{got their first}} big break after a concert at the Coliseum Theatre. In March 1996, a rock gig {{was held at the}} Coliseum Theatre {{featuring}} up and coming Welsh bands Catatonia, along with local bands Krazy Keyboards (later to become Dylan Thorn), Pocket Devils and Tragic Love Company (aka the <b>Stereophonics).</b> Famous rock band manager John Brand attended the concert to see the Pocket Devils, but was so impressed with the Tragic Love Company (<b>Stereophonics)</b> he signed them. Three months later and the <b>Stereophonics</b> would sign their record deal with Richard Bransons V2 label.|$|R

5|$|In 1946 the {{orchestra}} began recording for EMI's rival, Decca. The LPO's first recording for the label, Stravinsky's Petrushka, conducted by Ernest Ansermet, {{was followed by}} a large number of sessions as the company rebuilt its catalogue after the war. Among those who recorded with {{the orchestra}} for Decca were van Beinum, Sargent, de Sabata, Furtwängler, Charles Munch, Clemens Krauss, Hans Knappertsbusch, Erich Kleiber and the young Solti. The orchestra's first <b>stereophonic</b> recording was made for Decca in 1956, with Boult in Vaughan Williams's Eighth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|NBN {{was one of}} many {{stations}} {{opposed to}} aggregation, and offered an alternative by opening up a second station which it would operate {{for a period of time}} before selling it. This proposal was however rejected, and aggregation occurred on 31 December 1991, with NBN acquiring Nine Network affiliation. Following aggregation, the station's coverage expanded to cover all of northern New South Wales, whilst concurrently programming extended to twenty-four hours in a day, in <b>stereophonic</b> sound. In 1994, NBN Television's logo was updated to a pseudo-Nine logo, similar to fellow affiliate WIN Television.|$|E
5|$|Quad {{have now}} brought out five {{generations of the}} classic {{electrostatic}} design. Originally designed for monaural sound in a domestic context, the popularisation of <b>stereophonic</b> sound prompted the manufacturer to modify the electrostatic panels to improve their stereo dispersion. These speakers featured larger panels and a revolutionary stator design, made up of eight concentric rings fed from the centre outwards through analogue delay lines, so that the audio signal gives the illusion of radiating from a point source one foot behind the panel.|$|E

5|$|During this period, WIN {{expanded}} to include new stations in Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales. In 1984, WIN became the first regional television station to transmit in <b>stereophonic</b> sound. Close links between WIN Television and the Nine Network, ensured it the Nine Network affiliation for southern New South Wales when aggregation took place in 1989 thus the logo of the station changed to that of its partner network with the matching nine dots and similar ident packages. The changes meant that WIN expanded {{into the rest of}} southern New South Wales, launching new stations in Canberra, Orange, Bathurst, Dubbo and Wagga Wagga, amongst others in 1989, {{and at the same time}} acquiring new facilities in Orange, Wagga and Canberra. It also provided the network with two additional competitors, The Prime Network and Capital Television.|$|E
5|$|In late 1952, the National Trust {{moved the}} {{collection}} of keyboard instruments to Fenton House, and {{the family moved to}} Brondesbury Road, and then, in 1953, to a house they bought in Oxgate Gardens. Robert worked for the BBC as a studio manager for The Goon Show and the BBC World Service, and then for EMI, where he was involved with the development of <b>stereophonic</b> sound and the LP record. Her health deteriorated after Stephen's birth, and she had a hysterectomy. Her aunt Phyl took care of the children while she recovered. In 1955, her husband, unable to reconcile his lifestyle with his homosexuality, returned to the United States, and she became a single mother. She returned to work, initially in a biscuit factory, and then in a series of clerical jobs.|$|E
5|$|The arcade game {{features}} {{raster graphics}} on a CRT monitor displaying 4096 colors and amplified <b>stereophonic</b> sound. The visuals are reflected into view via a {{mirror in the}} cabinet. The arcade cabinet is upright, with the marquee bearing the game's name protruding outward. There are large, blue plastic molds around the cabinet designed to resemble an alien cocoon. The music for Space Gun was composed by Norihiro Furukawa and Naoto Yagishita of Zuntata, Taito's music division. A soundtrack CD (a split release with the soundtrack for Taito game Liquid Kids) was released by Pony Canyon and Scitron on January 21, 1991. This album was also released as part of Taito 1500 Collector's Box on September 17, 1993. A track from the game is on the limited edition CD Zuntata History L'ab-normal 1st, released by Zuntata/Taito on April 1, 1999.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving {{a series of}} concerts at the Festival Hall and the Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams. In 1956 the LPO toured the Soviet Union, the first British orchestra to do so; the conductors were Boult, Anatole Fistoulari and George Hurst, and the soloists were Alfredo Campoli and Moura Lympany. After the tour Boult retired as principal conductor, but remained {{closely associated with the}} orchestra, and was made its President in 1965. Most of his <b>stereophonic</b> recordings for EMI were made with the LPO.|$|E
5|$|Within {{six months}} of his return to Britain in 1943, Barbirolli resumed his {{contract}} with HMV, conducting the Hallé in the Third Symphony of Bax and the Fifth of Vaughan Williams, followed by works by {{a wide range of}} composers from Corelli to Stravinsky. In 1955 he signed a contract with Pye Records, with whom he and the Hallé recorded a wide repertoire, and made their first <b>stereophonic</b> recordings. These records were distributed in the US by Vanguard Records. A company was formed, named Pye-Barbirolli, of which he was a director: the arrangement was designed to ensure an equal partnership between the company and the musicians. They made many recordings, including symphonies by Beethoven, Dvořák, Elgar, Mozart, Nielsen, Sibelius, Mahler, Tchaikovsky and Vaughan Williams, as well as a few concertos, short orchestral pieces and operatic excerpts.|$|E
5|$|Okada {{described}} the main theme as power achieved through intelligence and overcoming the environments. The main narrative featured multiple references to Chinese mythology, {{while many of}} the player characters drew from historical and literary figures from each country the game visited. The Hakke leaders of the Sangokai were designed around a particular part of their body being malformed. A narrative element carried over from the Megami Tensei franchise was a system of choices based on morality that influenced the ending; while these elements had been thoroughly explored in Megami Tensei, the team felt the themes still had potential and so used it in Maken X. The game was Atlus' first title to feature full voice acting; the team initially planned to voice event scenes in English and Chinese with Japanese subtitles, but included voice acting across the whole game due to positive feedback. A similar set of circumstances led to the wide use of <b>stereophonic</b> sound across the whole game when it was initially planned only for action sequences.|$|E

5|$|The main CPU of the Sega CD is a 12.5MHz 16-bit Motorola 68000 processor, {{which runs}} 5MHz {{faster than the}} Genesis processor. It {{contains}} 1 Mbit of boot ROM, allocated for the CD game BIOS, CD player software, and compatibility with CD+G discs. 6 Mbit of RAM are allocated to data for programs, pictures, and sounds; 512 Kbit to PCM waveform memory; 128 Kbit to CD-ROM data cache memory; and an additional 64 Kbit are allocated as the backup memory. Additional backup memory {{in the form of}} a 1 Mbit Backup RAM Cartridge was also available as a separate purchase, released near the end of the system's life. Audio is able to be supplied through the Ricoh RF5C164, and two RCA pin jacks allow the Sega CD to output <b>stereophonic</b> sound separate from the Genesis. Combining stereo sound from a Genesis to either version of the Sega CD requires a cable between the Genesis's headphone jack and an input jack on the back of the CD unit. This is not required for the second model of the Genesis.|$|E
5|$|All the composer's {{major works}} {{and many of}} the minor ones have been recorded. There have been {{numerous}} complete LP and CD sets of the nine symphonies, beginning with Boult's Decca cycle of the 1950s, most of which was recorded in the composer's presence. Although rarely staged, the operas have fared well on disc. The earliest recording of a Vaughan Williams opera was Hugh the Drover, in an abridged version conducted by Sargent in 1924. Since the 1960s there have been <b>stereophonic</b> recordings of Hugh the Drover, Sir John in Love, Riders to the Sea, The Poisoned Kiss, and The Pilgrim's Progress. Most of the orchestral recordings have been by British orchestras and conductors, but notable non-British conductors who have made recordings of Vaughan Williams's works include Herbert von Karajan, Leonard Bernstein, Leopold Stokowski, and, most frequently, André Previn, who conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the first complete stereo cycle of the symphonies, recorded between 1967 and 1972. Among the British conductors most closely associated with Vaughan Williams's music on disc and in concert in the generations after Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli are Vernon Handley, Richard Hickox, Sir Mark Elder and Sir Andrew Davis. Record companies with extensive lists of Vaughan Williams recordings include EMI, Decca, Chandos, Hyperion and Naxos.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the motion}} picture {{industry}} was threatened by the advent of television—TV kept moviegoers at home, reducing box office revenues. Film studios sought to lure audiences to theaters with attractions that television could not provide. These included a revival of color films, three-dimensional films, <b>stereophonic</b> sound, and widescreen movies. Cinerama {{was one of the}} first widescreen movie processes of the era. In its initial conception, the cumbersome system required three cameras for shooting and three synchronized projectors to display a picture on one wide, curved screen. Along with the logistical and financial challenges of tripling equipment usage and cost, the process led to distracting vertical lines between the three projected images. Looking for a high-impact method of widescreen filmmaking that was cheaper, simpler, and less visually distracting, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to a process it branded CinemaScope: in this system, the film was shot with anamorphic lenses. The film was then exhibited with a complementary anamorphic lens on the projector that expanded the image, creating a projected aspect ratio (the ratio of the image's width to its height) twice that of the image area on the physical frame of film. By the time the first CinemaScope movie—The Robe (1953)—was announced for production, Gottschalk, Moore and Nicholson had a demo reel of work with their anamorphic underwater system.|$|E

25|$|A stereo {{microphone}} integrates two microphones in {{one unit}} {{to produce a}} <b>stereophonic</b> signal.

Some such microphones have an adjustable angle of coverage between the two channels.|$|E
25|$|A lifelong and ardent fan of {{the newest}} and most {{experimental}} techniques in recording, Stokowski {{saw to it that}} most of the music for Fantasia was recorded over Class A telephone lines laid down between the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and Bell Laboratories in Camden NJ, using an early, highly complex version of multi-track <b>stereophonic</b> sound, dubbed Fantasound, which shared many attributes with the later Perspecta <b>stereophonic</b> sound system.
