5|$|In January 2012 Cricket Ireland chief {{executive}} Warren Deutrom publicly declared Ireland's ambition to play Test cricket by 2020. Their desire to achieve Test status {{was in part}} to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> Irish players using residency rules to switch to England {{for the opportunity to}} play Test cricket. Deutrom outlined the ambition as he unveiled the new strategic plan for Irish cricket to 2015. The plan set out a series of stretching goals including increasing the number of participants in the game to 50,000, setting a target of reaching 8th in the World rankings, establishing a domestic first-class cricket structure, and reinforcing cricket as the fifth most popular team sport in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|After resigning, Aqil left Galilee for Tell el-Hesi in {{the region}} of Gaza. Around this time, Aqil married off a {{daughter}} of his to the leading Bedouin sheikh of the area, Rabbah al-Wahaidi. Bedouin raiding, now with the participation of the smaller tribes of Galilee, resumed not long after Aqil's resignation and concerns by the local merchants and European consuls were voiced to Kapuli Pasha due to the incoming harvest season for cotton and grain from Galilee and Hauran. Hasan Effendi sought to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> looting by attempting to play one Bedouin tribe off of the other. Kapuli Pasha was doubtful of this policy's effectiveness and strove to use military force instead. He personally led a contingent of troops in Galilee and ensured a peaceful harvest through the end of 1863. However, Kapuli Pasha determined that he could not keep a large, permanent military contingent in Galilee and decided to reinstate Aqil to his former position after lobbying from the British consul of Haifa.|$|E
5|$|The Australian 3rd and 4th Divisions {{had been}} sent south to help <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the German Spring Offensive towards Amiens, and with the British 35th Division, they held a line west and north of the Ancre river and the area between the Ancre and Somme. Much of the Allied front line {{consisted}} {{of a series of}} posts strung out along a railway embankment between Albert and Buire-sur-l'Ancre. The main German assault force was the 50th Reserve Division of the XXIII Reserve Corps, which concentrated its assault on the line between Albert and Dernancourt, attacking off the line of march after a short artillery preparation. Supporting attacks were to be launched by the 13th Division further west. Some German commanders considered success unlikely unless the embankment was weakly held, and the commander of the German 2nd Army ordered the attack's postponement, but that message did not reach the assaulting troops in time.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression {{provided}} a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists. The moderate political parties were increasingly unable to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology. The elections of September 1930 {{resulted in the}} break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet. Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg. Governance by decree became the new norm and {{paved the way for}} authoritarian forms of government. The NSDAP rose from obscurity to win 18.3 percent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next five months, the 39th Battalion rotated between the front line and rear areas, holding the line in Belgium {{throughout}} winter. In the spring of 1918, when the German Army launched its last effort at victory, known as the Spring Offensive, the 39th was among the many Australian battalions that were hurriedly moved south to France in order to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the German onslaught towards Amiens; fighting a series of defensive actions in the Somme between late March and early June. When the Allies launched their own offensive—the Hundred Days Offensive—on 8 August 1918, the battalion along with the rest of the 10th Brigade, was serving as the divisional reserve and they did not participate in the advance that has since become known as one of the greatest days for the Allies on the Western Front. On 10 August, the battalion was committed to battle once more, undertaking an attack on the village of Proyart, but this attack was ill-conceived and ultimately failed. Despite this, the battalion remained in the line throughout August and early September as the 3rd Division advanced through the Somme Valley.|$|E
5|$|In May the {{battalion}} was {{withdrawn from the}} front line for re-organisation and training. It did not return until the Third Battle of Ypres in September and October 1917, when they were committed to the fighting first at Menin Road. The 7th Battalion had 57 men killed in this phase, and then later at Broodseinde another 98 were killed. Following these battles, the 7th Battalion was withdrawn from the front line once more in December. In March 1918, however, following {{the start of the}} German Spring Offensive, {{the battalion}} was called back to help <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the German advance. As the German offensive ran out of momentum, the battalion kept up the pressure on the German line through a series of peaceful penetrations, before subsequently taking part in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which was launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918. As a part of this offensive, the battalion fought major actions at Lihons on 9–11 August where they captured a number of German mortars and Herleville Woods on 23 August. They continued operations until late September 1918 when they were withdrawn with a strength of just 410 men and it was out of the line when the armistice came into effect in November. Shortly afterwards the demobilisation process began and as the battalion's numbers fell as men were repatriated back to Australia, it was amalgamated with 6th Battalion. This battalion was amalgamated with another, formed from the 5th and 8th Battalions, to form the 2nd Brigade Battalion.|$|E
50|$|Following his apprehension, Breivik was characterised by analysts {{as being}} a right-wing extremist with anti-Muslim views and a {{deep-seated}} hatred of Islam, who considered himself a knight dedicated to <b>stemming</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> Muslim immigration into Europe.|$|R

25|$|The Pigtail Ordinance was {{proposed}} {{as a solution}} to the overcrowding of jails due to the 1870 Sanitary Ordinance, which was originally meant to prevent unsafe tenement conditions in San Francisco. When in violation of the Sanitary Ordinance, one could either pay a fine or serve a week or more in jail; for thousands of impoverished Chinese immigrants, free room and board was a welcome punishment. Ostensibly to prevent outbreaks of lice and fleas, the Supervisors began requiring that all prisoners' heads be shaved. Many equal rights advocates, however, claimed the Supervisors' true intent was to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> willing Chinese convicts.|$|E
25|$|In Pax Britannica, Voigt set out {{his views}} {{as to how}} the post-war world should be ordered, placing {{particular}} emphasis on the role that Britain should play in the new world order. He argued that the continuance of British imperial power was essential to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> Communist revolution and maintain peace and stability in what was termed the Third World. Furthermore, he believed a strong Britain and a rehabilitated Germany were essential to prevent Soviet expansion in Europe, and that British foreign policy should have three main principles: the maintenance of {{the balance of power in}} Europe, ensuring the independence of all her neighbours and “armed strength, and readiness, upon just cause, to fight”.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the Renaissance Center in Downtown Detroit marked a new era for the city's architecture.

25|$|A {{major change}} was the {{introduction}} of television in 1956. The Labor Party had, in June 1949, pledged to introduce television into Australia as soon as possible, but it had lost office later that year, and the Liberal Menzies government was opposed to television, which Menzies hoped would never come to Australia. Nonetheless, {{he was unable to}} <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> public opinion, and the Broadcasting and Television Act (1956) allowed for television in Australia {{just in time for the}} 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne. The addition of television caused a spurt of growth at the ABC, as staff numbers grew from 2,000 in 1956 to 3,000 in 1960, while the budget doubled from ₤3.7 million to ₤7.4 million.|$|E
25|$|The British force, {{numbering}} initially {{over forty}} five hundred men, was easily able to outmaneuver the Nepalese army defenders and {{force them to}} abandon one post after another. Despite a significant victory over Captain Hearsey’s force, which had been sent on a flanking movement though Eastern Kumaun, and the capture of the captain himself, the Nepalese army was unable to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> the British advance. Hasti Dal Shah arrived in Almora with a small body of reinforcement troops. A further reinforcement of four companies was sent from Kathmandu to aid the beleaguered defences of Kumaun, but the difficulties of communication through the hills prevented them from arriving in time to be of any help.|$|E
25|$|The Blue Jays' struggles {{were further}} aggravated by an {{extremely}} unfavourable currency exchange rate. In the early 2000s, the Canadian dollar traded for {{as low as}} 62 U.S. cents, resulting in massive losses for the Blue Jays who collected most of their revenues in Canadian dollars but paid player salaries in U.S. dollars. When J. P.

25|$|He became {{leader of}} Fianna Fáil on the {{resignation}} of Bertie Ahern. On 7 May 2008, following {{the resignation of}} Ahern as Taoiseach, Cowen was nominated by Dáil Éireann to replace him and was appointed by the President later that day. His administration coincided with the Irish financial and banking crises. He has received substantial criticism for his failure to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> either crisis, ultimately culminating in his government's formal request for financial rescue from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, widely seen in Ireland as a national humiliation. Cowen's leadership saw public support for Fianna Fáil plunge to record lows, {{as well as the}} lowest public support on record for both a sitting Irish government and a sitting Taoiseach. With approval at 8 percent by the time the 30th Dáil was dissolved, he was the least popular incumbent politician in the history of Irish opinion polling.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{international}} release of All or Nothing, the inserts for the American {{version of the}} album explicitly attributed the vocals to Morvan and Pilatus. This prompted singer Charles Shaw to reveal in December 1989 {{that he was one}} of the three actual singers on the album and that Pilatus and Morvan were impostors. Farian reportedly paid Shaw $150,000 to retract his statements, though this did not <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> public criticism. Because of growing public questioning as to who sang in the group, as well as the Morvan and Pilatus' demand to Farian that they be allowed to sing on the next album, Farian confessed to reporters on 12 November 1990 that Morvan and Pilatus did not sing on the records. As a result of American media pressure, Milli Vanilli's Grammy was withdrawn four days later.
