40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a European Union (EU) research project entitled "Food Safety Screening: Synthetic Glucocorticoids (QLK 1 - 1999 - 00122)," an international interlaboratory ring test was organized to compare and evaluate different liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) confirmatory methods that are applied in European monitoring programs for detecting the use of synthetic glucocorticoids. Liver and urine samples of bovines treated with synthetic glucocorticoids were collected and sent to the participants of the study for analysis. Participants received 3 liver and 3 urine samples and were free to use either their own LC/MS method or an LC/MS-based method developed during the EU research project. The residue concentrations in the samples were calculated as the mean of the concentrations reported by each laboratory. The mean dexamethasone concentration of liver sample L 1 was calculated as 2. 27 μg/kg [relative standard deviation (RSD) 43 %, n = 9], which exceeds the maximum residue level (MRL) of 2 μg/kg. Three of the 9 laboratories (33 %) reported concentration levels less than 2 μg/kg, resulting in obviously false compliant results. The overall mean concentration of flumethasone in liver sample L 2 was calculated as 3. 27 μg/kg (RSD 33 %, n = B). Applying a comparable limit for flumethasone of 2 μ/kg, 8 of the 9 laboratories would have obtained a correct noncompliant result. As for the blank liver sample, 1 participant found a false noncompliant result. The urine <b>sample</b> <b>U</b> 1 contained prednisolone residues at a mean concentration of 1. 58 μg/kg (RSD 43 %, n = 9).

Possible effects of chemicals (e.g., estrogenic activities) might be masked by the low water temperatures, since the snails are not in their reproductive period.

40|$|Motivation: Sources of {{uncontrolled}} noise strongly influence {{data analysis}} in microarray studies, yet signal/noise ratios are rarely considered in microarray data analyses. We hypothesized that different research projects would have different sources {{and levels of}} confounding noise, and built an interactive visual analysis tool to test and define parameters in Affymetrix analyses that optimize the ratio of signal (desired biological variable) versus noise (confounding uncontrolled variables). Results: Five probe set algorithms were studied with and without statistical weighting of probe sets using Microarray Suite (MAS) 5. 0 probe set detection p values. The signal/noise optimization method was tested in two large novel microarray datasets with different levels of confounding noise; a 105 <b>sample</b> <b>U</b> 133 A human muscle biopsy data set (11 groups) (extensive noise), and a 40 <b>sample</b> <b>U</b> 74 A inbred mouse lung data set (8 groups) (little noise). Success was measured using F-measure value of success of unsupervised clustering into appropriate biological groups (signal). We show that both probe set signal algorithm and probe set detection p-value weighting have a strong effect on signal/noise ratios, and that the different methods performed quite differently in the two data sets. Among the signal algorithms tested, dChip difference model with p-value weighting was the most consistent at maximizing {{the effect of the}} target biological variables on data interpretation of the two data sets.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and explores {{a theoretical framework}} of common features across labor-community coalitions. While researchers in both the U.

This paper argues that all coalitions are defined by four common elements: the nature of common concern, the structure of organizational relationships, organizational capacity and commitment, and the scale of coalition activity. It then uses these elements to identify four different ideal types of coalitions, varying from ad hoc coalitions, to simple coalitions, to mutual interest coalitions to deep coalitions. The paper illustrates the usefulness of this framework by using it to examine sample coalition experiences in the U. S. and Australia. The Australian case displays variation in coalition type within a single ongoing campaign around public education.

The study also compares attitudes of Navy and Marine Corps officers on the topic. A survey, used in two previous studies (1994 and 1996), was distributed to Naval officers at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in October 1999. Hypothesis testing, factor analysis, and regression analysis were used to analyze responses to the survey. The results show that Naval officers are less tolerant of homosexuals in the military than is the general population; Navy officers are more tolerant than Marine officers; Navy women are more tolerant than men of either service; and junior officers tend to be more tolerant than those in higher ranks. Further, officers with casual or no homosexual acquaintances are less tolerant than are those with friends or relatives who are homosexual. A general trend toward increasing tolerance was observed over the six-year period; yet, levels of misunderstanding regarding the details of the military's policy were as high in 1999 as in earlier years.

30|$|We also {{calculated}} the total and anterior Bolton indices [37]. We analysed both monolateral and bilateral agenesis, {{finding that the}} mesio-distal widths of teeth in agenesis patients are reduced (except for U 6). Hence, the mean total ratio in our sample was 87.76 (SD 4.15), less than that proposed by Bolton (91.3, SD 1.91) and indicating {{the presence of a}} maxillary excess. This discrepancy could be caused by the fact that while calculating the maxillary sum, we replaced U 2, which has a mesio-distal diameter of 6.5  mm, with U 7, whose mesio-distal diameter is 9  mm [38]. Furthermore, according to our findings, the U 6 is the only tooth whose mesio-distal diameter is not reduced in agenesis patients, which could also help explain the total maxillary excess we found. In contrast, we measured a mean anterior Bolton ratio of 79.49 (SD 3.71), which compared to the Bolton index (77.2, SD 1.65) lets us assume an upper anterior deficiency. In bilateral agenesis cases, the anterior maxillary sum is generally calculated using U 4 instead of the missing U 2, whose mesio-distal widths are almost equal in normal conditions [38] (7  mm U 4, 6.5  mm U 2). However, in cases of monolateral agenesis (48 % of our sample), the contralateral incisor is often microdontic [31] (mean width of our <b>sample</b> <b>U</b> 2 is 4.54  mm, SD 0.79) considerably reducing the maxillary sum, which is likely to explain the mean anterior maxillary defect.|$|E
