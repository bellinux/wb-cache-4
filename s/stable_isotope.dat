50|$|Out {{of the six}} known chalcogens, one (oxygen) has {{an atomic}} number equal to a nuclear magic number, which means that their atomic nuclei tend to have {{increased}} stability towards radioactive decay. Oxygen has three <b>stable</b> <b>isotopes,</b> and 14 unstable ones. Sulfur has four <b>stable</b> <b>isotopes,</b> 20 radioactive ones, and one isomer.

Such a slow process tends to favor isotopes with atomic mass numbers (A = protons + neutrons) around 90, 138 and 208, which have unusually stable atomic nuclei with 50, 82, and 126 neutrons, respectively. 89Y has a mass number close to 90 and has 50 neutrons in its nucleus.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the great}} rarity of odd–odd nuclei, almost all the {{primordial}} isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even (the exceptions being the light <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> lithium-6 and the long-lived radioisotope potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single beta-stable nuclide, since {{there is not a}} difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number (isobars) free to beta decay toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single <b>stable</b> <b>isotope,</b> all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons.
