40|$|OBJECTIVES—Because of the {{rarity of}} small bowel {{adenocarcinoma}} (SBA), {{little is known}} about the aetiology of this disease. This study aimed to identify occupational clustering of cases SBA as a systematic approach to new hypotheses on the aetiology of this disease.  METHODS—A European multicentre case-control study was conducted in 1995 - 7, inclusive. Incident cases aged 35 - 69 years with SBA (n= 168) were recruited before acceptance by a pathologist. Altogether 107  cases and 3915  controls were accepted, of which 79  cases, 579  colon cancer controls, and 2070  population controls were interviewed.  RESULTS—The strongest industrial risk factors for SBA taking account of 10  years' exposure lag were dry cleaning, manufacture of workwear, mixed farming (women), and manufacture of motor vehicles (men). A significantly increased risk of SBA (odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI)) was found among men employed as building caretakers, OR 6. 7  (1. 7  to 26. 0) and women employed as housekeepers, OR 2. 2  (1. 1  to 4. 9); general farm labourers, OR 4. 7  (1. 8  to 12. 2); dockers, OR 2. 9  (1. 0  to 8. 2); dry cleaners or launderers, OR 4. 1  (1. 2  to 13. 6); and textile workers (sewers or embroiders), OR 2. 6  (1. 0  to 6. 8). For the last four groups, together with welders OR 2. 7  (1. 1  to 6. 6) (men) an exposure-response pattern was found when calculating the ORs for jobs held 1 - 5 years and > 5 years, with never having held the job as reference. The ORs (95 % CIs) for 1 - 5 years and > 5 years were 4. 3  (0. 4  to 44. 0) and 3. 5  (0. 9  to 13. 7), 3. 0  (0. 3  to 26. 2) and 4. 3  (0. 9  to 21. 2), 4. 6  (0. 4  to 48. 1) and 11. 0  (2. 0  to 60. 4), 1. 3  (0. 2  to 11. 0) and 5. 8  (2. 0  to 17. 2), and 2. 8  (0. 3  to 23. 8) and 4. 6  (1. 3  to 16. 6), respectively, for each of these occupations. Among welders, people performing <b>semiautomatic</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (MIG/MAG) were identified as a high risk group (OR 5. 0  (1. 3  to 19. 6)).  CONCLUSIONS—This explorative study suggests an increased occurrence of SBA in certain occupations, which needs further evaluation.    Keywords: small intestine; adenocarcinoma; occupational risk factor...|$|E

Alloy {{on the basis}} of aluminium of АК 8 М 3 type served as the re-search material. As a result of mechanical treatment of the ingots after alloy crystallization the plates with 10 mm thickness were obtained. After edge preparation the elements, which are being connected were butt welded using the technology of <b>semiautomatic</b> argon <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> by the electrode with a diameter of 3 mm of AK- 5 alloy. Metal structure of the welded joint was examined under the light microscope at a magnification of 200 and under the scanning electronic microscope «JSM- 6360 LA». The Rockwell hardness (HRF) was used as a strength characteris-tic of alloy. Hardness measuring of the phase constituents (microhardness) was carried out using the device PМТ- 3, with the indenter loadings 5 and 10 g. The crystalline structure parameters of alloy (dislocation density, second kind of the crystalline lattice distortion and the scale of coherent scattering regions) were determined using the methods of X-ray structural analysis.

Welded-based material samples were characterized through Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), an inspection of Not Destructive Test (NDT) with penetrating liquids and ultrasound was also conducted. The following mechanical tests were completed, not only on the Base Metals (BM), on the Welding Join (WJ) as well: Vickers micro hardness profile, tension, and face bending test.

Other clean processes, such as electron beam welding or laser beam welding, are also acceptable; however, those that involve potential slag inclusions (such as submerged <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and Flux-cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding)</b> are obviously not. To avoid trapping gas or high vapor pressure molecules, welds must fully penetrate the joint or be made from the interior surface.|$|R

50|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} energy necessary for <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> processes, {{a number of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common classification is constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> the voltage {{is directly related to the}} length of the arc, and the current is related to the amount of heat input. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> flux cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> and submerged <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|R
