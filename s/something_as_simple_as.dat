50|$|It is {{imperative}} to note that, of the two protagonists, Mrs. Slade does not even knit, while Mrs. Ansley seems devoted to the craft. As the story progresses, one can even make a correlation between Mrs. Ansley’s mental state {{and the way in}} which she handles her needles and skeins. When she is nervous, she picks up her project cautiously, as if to draw as little attention <b>as</b> possible. However, <b>something</b> even <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> the way she stores her work, crimson silk being “run through” by her needles elicits a very provocative response in the reader. The switch between a “half guilty” extraction of her work to the subtle provocation of the passionate color and style of materials chosen changes the element of knitting from one of complacency to one of increasing complexity.|$|R
25|$|The {{conventions}} {{for professional}} artists working in private {{are much less}} defined, especially as the models are often friends or family. However, artists who regularly hire strangers tend to observe art school standards {{in order to make}} models feel more comfortable, and to avoid possible legal issues. Professional artists often hire the same models on a regular basis. When a comfortable working relationship is established, many artists relax their standards and models do the same. This may be <b>something</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> not undressing in another room, or not wearing a robe during breaks. In addition, silence is no longer necessary if the artist is comfortable working and conversing with the model. A more collegial relationship may develop where artist and model feel that they are collaborating. However, in a private studio environment, with an artist on a deadline or with commission guidelines, stricter work standards may apply regarding punctuality and holding longer, more demanding poses, but also require higher rates of pay.|$|E
25|$|These {{biological}} chemicals {{can arise}} from {{a host of}} means, {{but there are two}} common classes: (a) moisture induced growth of mold colonies and (b) natural substances released into the air such as animal dander and plant pollen. Mold is always associated with moisture, and its growth can be inhibited by keeping humidity levels below 50%. Moisture buildup inside buildings may arise from water penetrating compromised areas of the building envelope or skin, from plumbing leaks, from condensation due to improper ventilation, or from ground moisture penetrating a building part. Even <b>something</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> drying clothes indoors on radiators can increase the risk of exposure to (amongst other things) Aspergillus - a highly dangerous mould that can be fatal for asthma sufferers and the elderly. In areas where cellulosic materials (paper and wood, including drywall) become moist and fail to dry within 48 hours, mold mildew can propagate and release allergenic spores into the air.|$|E
25|$|This {{can occur}} {{even if the}} subject is not {{conscious}} of the priming stimulus. An example of this was done by Bargh et al. in 1996.

While the words did not explicitly mention speed or slowness, those who were primed with these words walked more slowly upon exiting the testing booth {{than those who were}} primed with neutral stimuli. Similar effects were found with rude and polite stimuli: those primed with rude words were more likely to interrupt an investigator than those primed with neutral words, and those primed with polite words were the least likely to interrupt. A Yale study showed that <b>something</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> holding a hot or cold beverage before an interview could result in pleasant or negative opinion of the interviewer.

40|$|The UK has {{something}} to celebrate, at least if one believes the tabloid headlines. It seems that it has moved from the {{back to the front}} of the queue to agree a trade deal with the United States. On the surface, a trade deal would be a good idea. The UK must now prepare to negotiate such deals with many countries, to replace those from which it will be excluded when it leaves the European Union (EU). (1) Failure to agree them risks defaulting to World Trade Organisation regulations, which would be severely damaging. Tariffs would make many British goods more expensive and it may be impossible to trade some of the services that are now a major source of the United Kingdom’s foreign earnings. More important are non-tariff barriers, such regulations and standards that allow the European single market to work, even if often mocked by Eurosceptics. Worst of all are quotas, which limit the amount of goods that overseas markets will import. Although, in theory, the UK is entitled to a share of the EU’s quotas for international trade, in practice, negotiating this is fiendishly difficult. A recent worked example using <b>something</b> <b>as</b> seemingly <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> lamb and mutton quotas showed that this could take years to resolve, (2) confirming that confident assurances about Brexit do not survive contact with reality. It is easy to see how the British government might be attracted by any offer of a swift and simple trade deal with the United States. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Hip hop {{culture has}} spread to both urban and {{suburban}} communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world. These elements were adapted and developed considerably, particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades. Even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms, including hip hop theater and hip hop film, the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hip hop culture. [...] Hip hop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon; the importance of sampling tracks, beats and basslines from old records [...] to the art form means {{that much of the}} culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings, attitudes, and experiences for modern audiences. Sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called [...] "flipping" [...] in hip hop culture. Hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier African-American-rooted musical genres such as blues, jazz, rag-time, funk, and disco {{to become one of the}} most practiced genres worldwide. It is the language of urban environments and the youth around the world, many who do not know what Hip Hop (the consciousness which makes up the collective culture of Hip Hop) is or what it means to [...] "Be Hip Hop" [...] , have recently begun to attribute being Hip Hop with being black, however that is race , not culture and not consciousness. as KRS-One says [...] "Hip Hop is the only place where you see Martin Luther King Jr. s; 'I have a dream speech' in real life" [...] and [...] "To be Hip Hop you have to have the courage to be you and be Hip Hop all the time not just when it's popular or convenient, and have repped it when it wasn't and you were the only one repping it."

40|$|Muscle {{degeneration}} {{describes the}} process whereby a muscle deteriorates and {{is unable to}} perform at its prior functionality. Muscle degeneration can be a symptom of aging, injury, nerve damage, stroke, motor neuropathy, muscular dystrophy and arthritis in addition to many ailments. Muscle degeneration impacts {{on the quality of}} life of those affected. To have a device which could stop or reverse muscle degeneration could have a significant impact on the quality of life for these people. Many who are affected by muscle degeneration experience barriers to undertaking strenuous exercise such as weights and resistance training. For these people, doing <b>something</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> and unobtrusive <b>as</b> wearing an armband, would be advantageous in reducing recovery time or assisting with ongoing problems. The purpose of this project is to test the ability of targeted Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) to increase muscle strength by designing and testing an apparatus that can be worn on the forearm. Targeted EMS was performed on opposing muscles located within the forearm and responsible for controlling the fingers for a period of 10 minutes at a time, extending over a 6 week period. Initially a PLC was adapted with custom hardware to provide the EMS, with a modified TENS device being used for the final testing of muscle strength improvement. It was found that not only is it possible to target individual muscles in the arm, but that stimulation of opposing muscles for short periods at a time can simulate resistance training, thereby increasing muscles strength and preventing or even reversing muscle degeneration during periods of inactivity without the need for strenuous exercise. ...|$|R

500|$|Valve {{aimed for}} a November 1997 release {{to compete with}} Quake II. By September 1997, the team found that while they had built a number of {{innovative}} aspects in weapons, enemies, and level design, the game was not fun and there was little design cohesion. The company postponed the release and reworked every level. They took a novel approach of assigning a small team to build a prototype level containing every element in the game, and then spent a month iterating on the level. When {{the rest of the}} team played the level, which designer Ken Birdwell described as [...] "Die Hard meets Evil Dead", they agreed to use it as a baseline. The team developed three theories about what made the level fun. First, the level had a number of interesting things happen in it and all when the player came into near proximity of the event, rather than based on time elements, so that the player would set the pace of the level. Second, the level had means to respond to any player action, even for <b>something</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> adding graphic decals to wall textures to show a bullet impact. Finally, the level warned the player of imminent danger to allow them to avoid it, rather than killing the player with no warning.|$|E
40|$|From {{earliest}} times, {{human societies}} have faced {{the challenge of}} supplying adequate quality and quantities of drinking water. Whether limited by arid environments or urbanization, provision of clean drinking water is a prerequisite of any enduring society, {{but it is a}} daunting task for drinking water is a multi-faceted resource. Drinking water is most obviously a physical resource, one of the few truly essential requirements for life. Drinking water is also a cultural resource, of religious significance in many societies. A social resource, access to water reveals much about membership in society. A political resource, the provision of water to citizens can serve important communication purposes. And finally, when scarce, water can become an economic resource. As recent conflicts in developing countries make clear, managing and mediating these many facets of drinking water is no easy matter. Understanding a society 2 ̆ 7 s ability to provide clean drinking water to its citizens, examining how it recognizes the different natures of this vital resource, provides a unique prism on the society 2 ̆ 7 s organization, equity, and view of itself. In seeking to understand better how societies manage such a critical resource, this article considers three questions. How have different societies thought about drinking water? How have different societies managed access to drinking water? And how have these changed over time? These questions are, of course, interrelated. How we think of water, whether as a sacred gift or a good for sale, both influences and is influenced by how we manage access to drinking water. While not an obvious issue to us in 21 st century America, management of drinking water as a resource - who gets it, when they get it, and how much they get - matters a great deal. Written for a symposium celebrating the scholarship of Carol Rose, this article synthesizes research to date from an ongoing book project on the history of drinking water. Using a case study approach, we journey on a wide-ranging geographical and historical tour, briefly exploring drinking water management in societies across five continents, from 5, 000 years ago up through today. Along the route, we find that <b>something</b> <b>as</b> seemingly <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> drinking water washes clear a society 2 ̆ 7 s views toward the role of government, norms, and the market...|$|R
40|$|Legislation is {{important}} to recordkeeping strategies and requirements, since it determines which records are needed for legally legitimate actions. Yet the concepts of a document, a record, a case, a transaction, etc., are frequently defined differently in various laws even within national boundaries and are urgently in need of harmonization to minimize complications and barriers to e-business transactions. Every country has its own legislation system which has been adjusted over time in correlation to national context and its surrounding society (Duranti, 1989 - 1990, p. 5). Duranti and Goh (2012) provided sound arguments as to why it {{is important}} to ensure national archival legislation keeps pace with our digitally networked society with its increasingly blurred borders. In addition to their own national law, members of the European Union (EU) are obliged to follow EU-legislation requirements. There are three types of EU legislation: regulations, directives and decisions. A regulation is applicable in all EU countries. Directives are general rules. A decision is a stipulation of issues of concern for specifically mentioned persons or organizations (European Commission, 2013).   Recommendations and statements are not binding, but may, for example, be used by the EU as support in interpretation of EU-legislation (Sveriges Riksdag, 2013). Hence, within public organizations, there is a close relation between records, recordkeeping processes, legislation and accountability.   Yet research in Sweden has shown that 24 / 7 e-service web-interfaces serving e-government strategies and ambitions are sometimes developed without consulting recordkeeping professionals, in ignorance of legal requirements for capture of records and that preservation issues are rarely considered when acquiring new digital systems (Kallberg, Svärd and Sundberg, 2010). Several other European studies also identify a lack of recordkeeping awareness within public organizations (Barata, 2004; Valtonen, 2007; Shepherd, Stevenson, & Flinn, 2009; Riksarkivet, 2010). However, there is currently a strong European political ambition to implement eGovernment services, which aims to promote cross-border business development. On the other hand, this challenges archival thinking to meet business, technological and legal requirements stipulated for each country. Varying legal definitions used can cause major problems for transactions both within a country and across national borders, even in <b>something</b> <b>as</b> seemingly <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> exchanging e-invoices. This paper will discuss an approach to identifying a way forward for harmonizing legislation that contains recordkeeping requirements across the EU. Identifying the range of / types of laws within countries and EU that define a record Using the ICA multilingual terminology database, to check and add to definitions already found there Checking against definitions found in international standards. Research towards harmonizing these crucial definitions will be very challenging, given linguistic and cultural differences but the ICA multilingual terminology database is a potential vehicle for checking existing usage, adding to the definitions and quotations from legalislation and the literature already found there and adding new terms. The foundation version of the ICA-funded Terminology Database, developed as an ICA Section for Archival Educators’ project led and hosted by the University of British Columbia, contains definitions with examples of usage for an initial 300 archival terms across 16 languages.
