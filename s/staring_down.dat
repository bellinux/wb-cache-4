5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> at them. The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E
25|$|The next Test was at {{his home}} ground, Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad. In good batting {{conditions}} the Australians had put on 576 runs in their first innings and the West Indies, having lost opener Devon Smith for a duck were <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> the barrel when Ganga came to the crease. In an innings which took 326 minutes, Ganga scored 117 and completed his second Test century in two innings against the Australians.|$|E
25|$|As {{it turned}} out, it was. Brett Lee, opening the bowling for Australia, {{started off with}} a maiden over to Trescothick, and England {{struggled}} {{to get off the}} mark, being four for no wicket after three overs. Another maiden from Glenn McGrath followed, and then Andrew Strauss departed with an inside edge off Lee. In the next over, Trescothick was gone for a 15-ball duck, to an away-swinger from McGrath, and two balls later Paul Collingwood gave a massive inside-edge onto his stumps – England were six for three, and <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> the barrel.|$|E

25|$|Bangladesh {{failed to}} convert a {{promising}} start into a competitive total {{in the third}} and final ODI of the series, as Maharoof and Lokuhettige conceded 46 runs off the eight opening overs, despite bowling in friendly conditions with plenty of clouds. Lokuhettige was especially expensive, and was duly taken off for Dilhara Fernando, who got the breakthrough for Sri Lanka as Javed Omar was out lbw to Fernando. That started the slide. Maharoof continued from the other end, inducing catches from the bats of Rafique and Shahriar Nafees, and suddenly Bangladesh were <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> a familiar hole, the score 51 for 3 at the end of 10 overs.|$|E
25|$|It started {{well for}} Australia, too. Including Michael Kasprowicz in the squad and {{gambling}} on winning the toss and subbing {{one of their}} bowlers off, they won it – and Kasprowicz got immediate reward. After the English openers had survived the opening overs of McGrath and Lee to be 25 for 0 after eight overs, Kasprowicz was brought on, and Strauss chopped an inside edge onto his own stumps. Nine balls and three runs later, captain Michael Vaughan was hit on the pads by an inswinging delivery from Glenn McGrath and was out for 1. Marcus Trescothick and Kevin Pietersen soon followed to the pavilion, and England were – yet again – <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> the barrel at 45 for 4.|$|E
25|$|This {{match was}} played {{two days after}} the other five {{placement}} matches. Scotland batted Ireland out of the match, their returning county professionals taking full advantage. Ryan Watson top-scored for the Scots with 94, but Dougie Brown (59 off 44 balls) and Fraser Watts (55) also made big contributions, as the Irish bowling conceded their highest total in this tournament – 324 for 8. Paul Hoffmann ripped out two Irish wickets quickly, but Ed Joyce and wicketkeeper Jeremy Bray rebuilt to 148 for 2. However, a flurry of wickets – Craig Wright taking three for 48 as the most – sent the Irish <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> the barrel, first at 188 for 6, and then at 222 for 9. Not even 34 not out from the number 11, Gordon Cooke could help Ireland, as they lost by 47 runs.|$|E

25|$|The 2008 NRL season saw Mini {{return to}} the field after a re-occurrence of his back injury put him out for the back half of the 2007 season. Unfortunately, during a round 4 clash with the Canterbury Bulldogs, pain in his back returned. This {{severely}} harmed his chances of regaining his Australian fullback jersey and he was overlooked in favour of both Brett Stewart and Melbourne Storm fullback Billy Slater. Stewart and Slater were also the respective fullbacks for NSW and Qld at the time. In 2009, Anthony played 2 games before injuring his ankle against the Canberra Raiders. He was sidelined until Round 20; by then, the Roosters were in deep trouble and <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> of their worst season since failing to win a single game in 1966. Eventually, the Roosters finished last on the NRL ladder, completing a spectacular downfall from {{the first half of}} the decade in which the Sydney Roosters were dominant, but had only one NRL Premiership to show for it.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} into the illegal agents' payments was concluded in the summer, and the club was handed a ten-point deduction for the 2008–09 season on 3 June 2008, along with a £50,000 fine. The club's recent history of administrations meant that the Football League only offered to return the Football League Share to Luton {{on the condition that}} they play with a further twenty-point deduction. <b>Staring</b> <b>down</b> the barrel of a gun, Luton were forced to start the season with a 30-point penalty, the biggest points deduction ever handed to a club in the top four tiers of English football. Luton beat Scunthorpe United 3–2 in the Football League Trophy final in front of 40,000 of their own supporters at Wembley Stadium, but lost their League status eight days later. On 13 April 2009, Luton Town were finally relegated from the Football League after a spell of 89 years, as Chesterfield held Luton to a draw. Coupled with a victory for Mike Newell's Grimsby Town, this meant Luton's survival in the league became mathematically impossible to achieve.|$|E

500|$|Batman conveys {{trademarks}} {{found in}} 1930s pulp magazines, notably {{the design of}} Gotham City stylized with Art Deco design. Richard Corliss, writing for Time, observed that Gotham's design was a reference to films such as Metropolis (1927) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920). [...] "Gotham City, despite being shot on a studio backlot", he continued, [...] "is literally another character in the script.

[...] Hanke further addressed the notions of Batman being a period piece, in that [...] "The citizens, cops, people and the black-and-white television looks like it takes place in 1939"; but later said: [...] "Had the filmmakers made Vicki Vale a femme fatale rather than a damsel in distress, this could have made Batman as a homage and tribute to classic film noir." [...] Portions of the climax pay homage to Vertigo.|$|E
500|$|It {{was decided}} that the sword needed to be {{different}} from other bat'leths seen on the show, and so a new hardened aluminium prop was ordered after numerous designs by John Eaves were considered on paper. As with the original bat'leth, Dan Curry created the prop. Sculptor Dragon Dronet then etched designs into the blade by hand using dental tools. The producers requested designs on the blade similar to the effects seen in Damascus steel, which was combined with Dronet's idea of forming these into a topographic map, with an effect described as being [...] "as if you're <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> at mountains". Klingon names were then added {{to the side of the}} weapon. Dronet also created the stand for the sword out of plexiglas which was spray-painted to look metallic. The legs of the stand were carved to look like the feet of the Klingon animal, the targ.

2500|$|The hosts Sri Lanka were {{yet again}} {{stunned by the}} West Indies' {{accurate}} and fierce pace bowling, as they chose to bowl first at Kandy. In the third over, they got immediate reward, having Sanath Jayasuriya caught behind off Daren Powell for 2 – however, TV replays indicated that the decision was unjustified. To the West Indians, that mattered little, as it gave them a much needed confidence boost. Ten overs later, Tino Best and Powell had dug out a further three wickets, and Sri Lanka were <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> the barrel at 42 for 4. Thilan Samaraweera and Tillakaratne Dilshan paired up for 56 for the fifth wicket before Best ran out Dilshan, but {{this time there was}} little wagging from the tail, only Muttiah Muralitharan making an unbeaten 18, as Powell took the last three wickets – both Rangana Herath and Lasith Malinga ending up caught behind – and Sri Lanka subsided for 150.|$|E

2500|$|A 17-year-old {{architecture}} student visiting Philadelphia in June 1873, Louis Sullivan, closely {{examined a}} house nearing completion at 510 South Broad Street, {{and decided that}} he was going to work for the firm that designed it. The next day he presented himself to Frank Furness, and was hired as a draftsman at US$10 a week. The Bloomfield H. Moore House was the most ambitious Furness & Hewitt domestic commission to date, and Furness's interiors – manufacture attributed to Pabst – were his most perverse. The egrets from the Roosevelt dining table reappeared, this time supporting the dining room mantel, but the house is best remembered for the nightmarish chimneypiece in its library. The tall and massive walnut chimneypiece featured compressed columns supporting oversized piers incised with stylized sunflowers, twin [...] "hounds of hell" [...] grotesques snarling from behind shields, a diapered and gold-leafed tympanum bisected by a center column, a crocketed pediment rising to a finial, and twin owls <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> from the roof. The Moore house was demolished in the 1950s, but much of the chimneypiece, stripped of its grotesques and thus about 3 feet (0.91 m) shorter, survives. Sullivan went on to lead the Chicago School of Architecture, and become the mentor to Frank Lloyd Wright.|$|E
