500|$|According to Inglis, [...] "Love You To" [...] is [...] "defined" [...] by {{the interplay}} between sitar and tabla. Bhagwat later {{recalled}} of his involvement: [...] "George told me what he wanted and I tuned the tabla with him. He <b>suggested</b> <b>I</b> play something in the Ravi Shankar style, 16-beats, though he agreed that I should improvise. Indian music is all improvisation." [...] After rehearsing the song together many times, Harrison and Bhagwat recorded the sitar and tabla parts onto the vocal and guitar performance taped earlier that day.|$|E

[...] On a particular incident: [...] "An MP once <b>suggested</b> <b>I</b> be put in the Tower of London for saying derogatory things about the royals." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Battaglia, [...] tentatively <b>suggested</b> (<b>i)</b> {{a different point}} where the V13 mutation happened on its way from Egypt to the Balkans via the Middle East, and (ii) a later dispersal time. The authors proposed that the V13 mutation first appeared in western Asia, where it is found in low but significant frequencies, whence it entered the Balkans sometime after 11 kYa. It later experienced a rapid dispersal which he dated to c. 5300 years ago in Europe, coinciding with the Balkan Bronze Age. Like Peričic et al. they consider that [...] "the dispersion of the E-V13 and J-M12 haplogroups seems to have mainly followed the river waterways connecting the southern Balkans to north-central Europe".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, {{you know}} what I mean,' she answered, with {{considerable}} anxiety not to be misunderstood; 'my liking for the old castle, and what it contains, and what it <b>suggests.</b> <b>I</b> declare I will not explain to you further--why should I? I am not answerable to you!' ...|$|R

2500|$|I {{was brought}} {{straight}} to the blocks. Cell 17, D wing H1 or 2. I was stripped and beaten. The screws who knew me said, 'We are the bosses now. There are no OCs here'. A screw said to me, 'What size {{are you in the}} waist and what size are you for shoes?' I asked him 'What for?' and he told me 'For a uniform'. I said, 'You have got to be joking'. I {{was the only one in}} the H-Blocks. They dragged me into the cell. Davy Long [...] wanted me to compromise. He <b>suggested</b> <b>I</b> wore my own shoes and trousers if I wore a prison shirt. I just laughed. He locked the door. I lay on the floor all night without mattress, blankets or anything else. The heat was reasonable in all fairness and I slept.|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist and vocalist Daniel Rossen, {{a friend}} of Bear's from jazz-camp, joined the band soon after. Rossen stated, [...] "For a long time, I only played my songs to close friends; and it just {{happened}} that I lived with Chris Taylor during my second year of college, so he heard them. He was my entrance into Grizzly Bear. He joined the band first, then {{after a while he}} <b>suggested</b> <b>I</b> come in with these songs. [...] When I joined, I did about two rehearsals with them, worked out one of my songs to put into the set, then a week later we were out on the road for a two-month tour. It was a real trial-by-fire thing. I was close with Chris and Chris , but I didn’t know Ed [...] at all; it was weird getting to know a stranger by spending all day in the same car." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then I {{should think}} it was quite time he began," [...] Arnold declared. [...] "You {{are not going to}} <b>suggest,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, that {{financial}} embarrassments {{had anything to do with}} Mr. Weatherley's disappearance?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Madame," [...] I said, [...] "permit me to leave. I shall try {{to forget}} {{what you have}} <b>suggested.</b> <b>I</b> love my little girl and I love money. But never that way!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had I {{been in her}} place," [...] {{said the}} Girton Girl, [...] "it {{would have been a}} {{separation}} I should have <b>suggested.</b> <b>I</b> should have hated him {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the poet}} never alluded to such wooing as {{that you have}} <b>suggested.</b> <b>I</b> suppose I had better begin with a {{schedule}} of my debts, and make reference, if she doubts me, to Fothergill, the sheriff's officers, and the Tozer family." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lord Truscott {{told the}} BBC he did admit to having had [...] "discussions" [...] with a reporter, {{but said that}} [...] "to <b>suggest</b> <b>I</b> would offer to put down {{amendments}} for money is a lie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'And {{how about}} the fare?' <b>I</b> <b>suggested,</b> for <b>I</b> thought maybe {{there might be a}} {{difficulty}} in collecting it {{at the end of the}} journey.|$|R
5000|$|.....People who <b>suggest</b> <b>I</b> make SIGNIFICANT {{changes to}} the protocol, such as 'full duplex', 'multiple {{outstanding}} blocks', 'multiple destinations', etc etc don't understand that the incredible simplicity of the protocol {{is one of the}} reasons it survived.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ham and eggs," [...] <b>suggested</b> <b>I,</b> whose {{mouth was}} {{watering}} at the recollection {{of that particular}} dish, which I had tasted at {{the sign of the}} Turkey Cock before. So ham and eggs it was; and royal coffee, and imperial toast.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may now {{dismiss the}} subject from your mind, sir, as you lately advised me to do. Whatever may be {{accomplished}} in the direction you have <b>suggested</b> <b>I</b> will gladly undertake. If I succeed it will be exceedingly gratifying to us all, I am sure." ...|$|E
60|$|My one-eyed {{friend had}} <b>suggested</b> <b>I</b> should seek lodgings {{at the house}} of one Mistress Cholmondley, a widow lady, who resided with her only {{daughter}} in the white-washed cottage that is the last house in the village, if you take the road that leads over Coll Fell.|$|E
6000|$|... "And can nothing be done? Would it be any use {{whatever}} to {{set to work}} on any line you can <b>suggest?</b> <b>I</b> would make it my own business, and follow up any clue you could give me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{might be}} allowed to take a further liberty, your lordship, might <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> that <b>I</b> am aware of the man's {{identity}} and of his motive for visiting the castle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{immediate}} {{thing is}} to defend her against this man Aiken. Mr. Bartol said he would order {{up a lot of}} books, and I'm to cram for the trial. If you have any book to <b>suggest,</b> <b>I</b> wish you'd write its title down for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear Miss Barrett,--Through {{our common}} friend Mr. Haydon I have {{received}} a sonnet which his portrait of me <b>suggested.</b> <b>I</b> should have thanked you sooner for that effusion of a feeling towards myself, with which I am much gratified, but I have been absent from home and much occupied.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's rather puzzling," [...] Marston replied thoughtfully. [...] "I <b>suggested</b> <b>I</b> {{should take}} a few to Flora, but {{he said they were}} not good enough. They're not really {{first-class}} pearls, you know. Then he said they might be unlucky. The strange thing is, I think he meant it." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{the funding}} of the {{national}} debt, as here <b>suggested,</b> <b>I</b> feel safe in saying that taxes and the revenue from imports may be reduced safely from sixty to eighty millions per annum at once, and may be still further reduced from year to year, as {{the resources of the}} country are developed.|$|E
6000|$|... "We have {{experienced}} that, my lord, else had we not been thus circumstanced," [...] said Varney. [...] "But {{what else to}} <b>suggest</b> <b>I</b> know not.

6000|$|... "Wasn't {{it always}} your principle, Benham, to look {{facts in the}} face? I am not pronouncing an immoral principle. Your manner <b>suggests</b> <b>I</b> am. I am telling you exactly how I feel. That is how I feel. I want--Venus. I don't want her to talk to or {{anything}} of that sort.... I have been studying that book, yes, that large, vulgar, red book, all the morning, instead of doing any work. Would {{you like to see}} it?... NO!...|$|R
60|$|From {{our point}} of view this was a frame of mind to be encouraged. I tried the {{experiment}} of modestly taking the blame on myself. <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> that <b>I</b> might be (quite innocently) answerable for Romayne's disappointment.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not prepared," [...] Vine said, rising, [...] "to come to any {{definite}} {{decision at}} this moment. Frankly, I {{want to use}} it so as to do you the greatest possible amount of harm. On the other hand, I never contemplated any such developments as you and John Drayton have <b>suggested.</b> <b>I</b> am going to think this matter over." ...|$|E
6000|$|Whether {{the man to}} whom we had appealed was {{at heart}} a friend to the colonies, or if he was {{prompted}} as Pierre had <b>suggested,</b> <b>I</b> cannot say; but this much I do know, that he brought us in a bag near to half a bushel of corn meal, and with it a large ham, saying as he laid the provisions on the threshold: ...|$|E
60|$|He made {{as if to}} rise, {{and remembered}} his ankle. He <b>suggested</b> <b>I</b> should help him {{as far as his}} bungalow.
