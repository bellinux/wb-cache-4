The rivers draining the South-East Carpathians have been studied under the aspect of the latest alterations of the main valley outline. An important database has been collected using the Horton- <b>Strahler</b> <b>classification</b> system, which has later been processed carefully concerning the rivers draining the South-East Carpathians, and a great deal of information has been extracted. What is more, the evolution of the hydrographic network has been related to the geological and tectonical states. Excellent results have been obtained by correlating the morphometric features of the hydrographic network with the geological and tectonical conditions of the studied area...|$|E

Bistra Mărului and Şucu rivers spring from Ţarcu Mountains and are tributaries of the accumulation lake of Poiana Mărului, being the main rivers transporting significant quantities of water to the lake. In order to perform an analysis from a morphometric {{point of view of}} the hydrographical network within the hydrographical basins of the two rivers, we have used the Horton - <b>Strahler</b> <b>classification</b> system, because, having a genetic basis, this classification system allows a comparative analysis of the hydrographical basins. By using this classification system, we have noticed that the two rivers have the same order and we have proved, what has already been known as a general rule, that the hydrographical basins with the same order, that are located in similar physical and geographical conditions, have on average approximately the same size of the reception basin surfaces, of the water flows, of the average slopes, of the course lengths etc. Moreover, we have proved that the two hydrographical basins have approximately the same shape and that the floods that they may generate are approximately identical as magnitude and manifestation...|$|E

40|$|The hydrographical {{network is}} a {{phenomenon}} under constant time and space changes. These ch_anges have seasonal and multi-annual character. The dynamics of this phenomenon needs estimation {{not only of the}} network itself but also of the water moving in it. This problem becomes particularly important {{in the case of the}} areas located near urban grounds which are under intense anthropopression. It is possible then to conclude of progressive influence of human activities after recognizing of the natural factors forming hydrographical network. The Dzierżązna drainage basin was explored up to the Swoboda closing profile (42, 9 km 2). It is located in the northern Łódź Upland part and is drained by the Moszczenica river system (fig. l). The southern boundary of the basin is determined by the urban Zgierz suburbs. Exactly this place in Malinka, there are springs of Dzierżązna river. Hydrographical network explorations were carried out basing on the topographic map in the scale 1 : 25 000. Thus the obtained data were updated and verified in the field in July 1998. Analysis of the river network parameters was carried out in the capacity of a drainage density (Wilgat's and Neumann's method) and a degree of an orderly arrangement (verification of the Horton's theory after the <b>Strahler's</b> <b>classification)</b> - fig. 2, 4, tab. l, 2. The authors also made detailed estimation of each stream: a river long fall, sinuosity and development (fig. 3, tab. l). Estimation also concerns time in which water running the channels reaches the closing profile and concerns the discharge rate as well. Their space layout is represented on the maps - fig. 5, 6. In the final stage of the study the authors tried to evaluate the running water resources basing on the resources momentum measure. Thanks to using the mentioned above procedure it was possible to take account the dynamics of the resource processes, because physical unit of the presented measure is (m^ 4 x S^-l) They also estimated degree of concentration of the resources in the river system (fig. 7, 8).

30|$|The present {{investigation}} has proved that remote sensing and {{geographical information system}} techniques are more efficient for computation {{and analysis of the}} morphometric parameters. There are 19 morphometric parameters that were calculated {{with the help of the}} Arc GIS 10.2 software. These 19 parameters help to understand the terrain characteristics, such as surface runoff, infiltration capacity, topography, lithology, and hydrological properties of the study area. According to <b>Strahler</b> <b>classification,</b> the study area has the sixth-order watershed and the dendritic drainage pattern is observed. The results of form factor, circulatory ratio, and elongation ratio stated the elongated shape of the watershed. The bifurcation ratio and stream numbers of the watershed show vulnerability for unpredicted flood during heavy rainfall. The value of mean bifurcation ratio is indicating that the watershed is not affected by structural disturbances and geological structures. The low drainage density, stream frequency, and infiltration number indicate that the watershed is caused by permeable subsoil and runoff is relatively moderate. The low drainage density shows good dimensions to construct the water harvesting structures in the streams. The high basin relief, relief ratio, and ruggedness number reveal that the peak discharge is likely to be relatively higher and the sediment yield per unit area is low.|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} county {{drainage}} was determined for four counties in South Central Minnesota {{followed by a}} study of the geomorphic nature of man’s drainage in contrast to natural drainage. Selected drainage ditches and low order rivers were sampled for water quality and quantity {{in order to determine the}} contributions and timing of nutrient loads from each. Seventy-nine percent of the drainage ditches were found to terminate into rivers and they more than doubled the length of the surface fluvial systems. The closeness of fit of the drainage ditch systems to the low order <b>Strahler</b> <b>classification</b> scheme suggests that man has taken an immature lake-marsh environment and within 100 years created a geomorphically mature fluvial landscape. Nutrient loading by ditches into receiving bodies was found to vary by season, by individual ditch or river, and by stream order indicating that each ditch was unique. Water quality of one ditch during this wet study year was compared to a previous dry year study and the nutrient loading data was consistent and predictable. The most significant loading nutrient chemical parameter to the Minnesota River was found to be nitrate-nitrogen. Flow showed flashy response to storm events in some ditches and some were quite conservative. Sediment load was directly correlated to flow. Water Resources Research Cente...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{comprehensive}} {{overview of the}} French Guiana's gold-mining activities along with a reliable gold predictivity map has been obtained {{as part of the}} 'Mineral Resources of French Guiana' GIS (3396 gold sites listed). The gold mining is almost exclusively in alluvial and eluvial deposits, with primary deposits representing only 2 % of the inventoried gold sites. Most of the deposits being allochthonous, a preliminary processing of the data was necessary to draw up a set of 'in-situ' deposits sufficient for a) calculating, correlations between the primary mineralization and the controlling geologic parameters, and b) assessing the favorabilities of the different criteria [...] i. e., lithostratigraphy, faults and lithostratigraphic contacts, geochemical and geophysical signatures. The processing, aimed at identifying and selecting sites close to primary sources, was based on ranking the catchment basins according to the <b>Strahler</b> <b>classification.</b> The resulting gold predictivity map combines a classical approach based on algebraic methods for processing polygon and line data, and an approach using cluster analysis for processing geochemical and radiometric data and identifying groups as marking mineralization signatures, then looking for and scoring grid pixels showing a high level of similarity. The map appears realistic. It confirms the value of the known metallotects and locates the main primary deposits; some deposits with a different geochemical and geophysical signature, however, would probably not have been picked up [...] hence the importance of the model used for establishing the map. The dual approach is easily transposable to other equatorial and poorly accessible countries...|$|E
30|$|Hydrologic and geomorphic {{processes}} {{occur within}} the watershed and morphometric characterization at the watershed scale reveals information regarding formation {{and development of}} land surface processes (Singh 1992, 1995; Dar et al. 2013). Drainage characteristics of many river basins and sub-basins {{in different parts of}} the globe have been studied using conventional methods (Horton 1945; Strahler 1957, 1964; Krishnamurthy et al. 1996). The surface runoff and flow intensity of the drainage system can be estimated using the geomorphic features associated with morphometric parameters (Ozdemir and Bird 2009). <b>Strahler’s</b> system of <b>classification</b> designates a segment with no tributaries as a first-order stream. Where two first-order stream segments join, they form a second-order stream segment and so on. The morphometric analysis of the drainage basin is aimed to acquire accurate data of measurable features of stream network of the drainage basin. Various hydrological phenomena can be correlated with the physiographic characteristics of an drainage basin such as size, shape, slope of the drainage area, drainage density, size and length of the contributories, etc. (Rastogi and Sharma 1976; Magesh et al. 2012 a).|$|R
30|$|A morphometric {{analysis}} of Bharathapuzha river basin {{has been carried}} out using geoprocessing techniques in GIS. This technique is found relevant for the extraction of river basin and its drainage networks. The extracted drainage network was classified according to <b>Strahler’s</b> system of <b>classification</b> and it reveals that the terrain exhibits dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage pattern. The Bharathapuzha drainage basin is sprawled over an area of 5, 988.56  km 2. The study area was designated as seventh-order basin and lower order streams mostly dominate the basin with the drainage density value of 1.07  km/km 2. The slope of basin varied from 0 ° to 70 ° and the slope variation is chiefly controlled by the local geology and erosion cycles. The elongation ratio of the basin is 0.57 indicating that the study area is elongated with moderate relief and steep slopes. The drainage texture of the basin is 7.78 which indicates an intermediate texture that exists over the region. Hence, from the study, it can be concluded that remote sensing data (SRTM–DEM) coupled with geoprocessing techniques prove to be a competent tool in morphometric analysis and the data can be used for basin management and other hydrological studies in future.|$|R
30|$|Development of a {{drainage}} {{system and the}} flowing pattern over space and time are influenced by several variables (Horton 1945; Leopold and Maddock 1953; Abrahams 1984). Many researcher’s works were based on arbitrary areas or individual channel segments by considering watershed as a unit. It involves quantitative measurements of the geographic parameters and provides measurement, mathematical analysis of {{the configuration of the}} earth’s surface as well as shape and dimensions of its landforms and quantitative description of the {{drainage system}}, which is an important aspect for the characterization of watersheds (Strahler 1964; Clarke 1966; Agarwal 1998; Sahu et al. 2014). Various hydrological parameters can be correlated with size, shape, slope, drainage density etc. of the drainage basin (Rastogi and Sharma 1976; Magesh et al. 2012). Hence, morphometric analyses provide information related to formation of various processes occurring on the surface of land (Singh 1992, 1995; Reddy et al. 2004 a; Dar et al. 2013) which can be better reflected through measurement of linear, aerial and relief aspects (Nautiyal 1994; Reddy et al. 2002; Banerjee et al. 2015). It involves the evaluation of stream parameters through the measurements of various stream properties. According to <b>Strahler’s</b> system of <b>classification,</b> the stream with no tributaries is designated as first-order, the stream formed by joining two first-order is designated as second -order and so on.|$|R
40|$|Three {{threshold}} {{conditions for}} channel initiation are evaluated by using gridded elevation data {{derived from a}} detailed lidar survey, a reliable algorithm for the determination of surface flow paths, and accurate field observations of channel heads for a study area located in the eastern Italian Alps. These three threshold conditions are determined by considering part of the observed channel heads and computing for them the related values of (1) the drainage area A, (2) the monomial area-slope function AS 2 of the drainage area A and the local slope S, and (3) the Strahler order ω* of surface flow paths extracted from gridded elevation data. Attention {{is focused on the}} dependence of the obtained threshold values on the size of grid cells involved, and on the ability of threshold conditions to predict channel heads. The results indicate that (i) the uncertainty in the threshold values of the Strahler order ω* is significantly smaller than that affecting the threshold values of the drainage area A and the area-slope function AS 2, (ii) threshold values of A, AS 2, and ω* are all significantly dependent on grid cell size, and (iii) the threshold values of the Strahler order ω* follow quite well a power function relationship of grid cell size. The comparison between predicted and observed channel heads, performed on three different drainage basins, indicates that <b>Strahler</b> <b>classification</b> of surface flow paths and pruning of exterior links provide a sound basis for the determination of channel heads formed essentially by surface erosion. In addition, it reveals that more comprehensive methods are needed to predict channel heads affected by groundwater seeping upwards in areas characterized by strong geologic controls...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen and {{phosphorus}} are essential {{elements in the}} aquatic ecosystems. Both nutrients are used by plants and algae for growth (EPA 2005). Excess nutrients can lead to increased algal production within the stream, depleted oxygen, and altered biological assemblages. Sources of excess nutrients include municipal sewage and septic tank drainfields, agricultural run-off, excess fertilizer applications, and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (Herlihy et al 1998). This indicator measures total phosphorus and total nitrogen based on data collected for the U. S. EPA’s Wadeable Streams Assessment (WSA) (in draft). Wadeable streams are streams, creeks and small rivers that are shallow enough to be sampled using methods that involve wading into the water. They typically include waters classified as 1 st through 4 th order in the <b>Strahler</b> Stream Order <b>classification</b> system (based {{on the number of}} tributaries upstream).
