5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} finds use {{in water}} purification and <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment,</b> in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in paints, as an additive in animal feed, and as an etchant for copper {{in the manufacture of}} printed circuit boards. It can also be dissolved in alcohol to form tincture of iron, which is used as a medicine to stop bleeding in canaries.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> {{processes}} rely on microorganisms {{to oxidise}} organic constituents. Anaerobic microorganisms reduce sludge solids producing methane gas and a sterile mineralised residue. In potable water treatment, one method, the slow sand filter, employs a complex gelatinous layer {{composed of a}} wide range of microorganisms to remove both dissolved and particulate material from raw water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> works depend {{for their}} ability to clean up water {{contaminated}} with organic material on microorganisms that can respire dissolved substances. Respiration may be aerobic, with a well-oxygenated filter bed such as a slow sand filter. Anaerobic digestion by methanogens generate useful methane gas as a by-product.|$|E

5|$|Zinc in rivers {{flowing through}} {{industrial}} and mining areas {{can be as}} high as 20ppm. Effective <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> greatly reduces this; treatment along the Rhine, for example, has decreased zinc levels to 50ppb. Concentrations of zinc as low as 2ppm adversely affects the amount of oxygen that fish can carry in their blood.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5|$|Grandaddy {{was formed}} in 1992 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Jason Lytle, bassist Kevin Garcia and drummer Aaron Burtch. The group was {{initially}} influenced by US punk bands such as Suicidal Tendencies and Bad Brains. Lytle was a former professional skateboarder, who had turned to music after a knee injury forced him to stop skating, working at a <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> works to fund the purchase of equipment, {{and several of the}} band's early live performances were at skateboarding competitions.|$|E

Considering a 50 kW power of a 10 Mev electron linear accelerator, an irradiation dose of 5 kGy and a treatment capacity of 346 tons per day, {{it is estimated that}} the treatment cost would be of $ 9. 00 US dollars per ton...|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the range of applications of archaean enzymes, {{the use of the}} organisms themselves in biotechnology is less developed. Methanogenic archaea are a vital part of <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment,</b> since {{they are part of the}} community of microorganisms that carry out anaerobic digestion and produce biogas. In mineral processing, acidophilic archaea display promise for the extraction of metals from ores, including gold, cobalt and copper.|$|E
5|$|Retail {{natural gas}} and water public {{utilities}} in Omaha are provided by the Metropolitan Utilities District. Nebraska is the only public power state in the nation. All electric utilities are non-profit and customer-owned. Electricity in the city {{is provided by the}} Omaha Public Power District. Public housing is governed by the Omaha Housing Authority, and public transportation is provided by Metro Area Transit. CenturyLink and Cox provide local telephone and internet services.

5|$|Used as a waste {{repository}} {{during the}} first half of the 20thcentury and cut off from the Columbia River by levees, the slough became one of Oregon's most polluted waterways. Early attempts to mitigate the pollution, which included raw sewage and industrial waste, were unsuccessful. However, in 1952 Portland began <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment,</b> and over the next six decades the federal Clean Water Act and similar legislation mandated further cleanup. State and local governments, often assisted by community volunteers, undertook projects related to public health, natural resources, and recreation in a region with many homes, industries, businesses, and roads. The businesses and industries in the watershed employ about 57,000people, which is also frequented by more than 150bird species and 26fish species and animals including otters, beaver, and coyotes. One of the nation's largest freshwater urban wetlands, Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, shares the lower slough watershed with a <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> plant, marine terminals, a golf course, and a car racetrack. Watercraft able to portage over culverts and levees can travel the entire length of the slough. The 40 Mile Loop and other hiking and biking trails follow the waterways and connect the parks.|$|E

5|$|Waste {{management}} is co-ordinated {{by the local}} authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority. Locally produced inert waste for disposal is sent to landfill at the Beal Valley. United Utilities manages Chadderton's drinking and waste water. Water supplies are sourced from several reservoirs in the borough, including Dovestones and Chew. A <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> works {{is located in the}} southwest of Chadderton, at Foxdenton. It opened in 1898.|$|E
5|$|When {{dissolved}} in water, iron(III) chloride undergoes hydrolysis and gives off heat in an exothermic reaction. The resulting brown, acidic, and corrosive solution {{is used as}} a flocculant in <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> and drinking water production, and as an etchant for copper-based metals in printed circuit boards. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is a fairly strong Lewis acid, and it {{is used as a}} catalyst in organic synthesis.|$|E
5|$|A fifth {{generating}} unit fueled by {{natural gas and}} oil {{was added to the}} Turkey Point generating station in 2007. In 2009, Turkey Point was proposed as the site of two new 1117MW AP1000 nuclear reactors, to be designated Turkey Point 6 and 7. If built, the new reactors would make Turkey Point one of the largest generating sites in the United States. Other neighboring influences on the bay are the agricultural lands of south Miami-Dade County, a <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> facility on the park boundary at Black Point, and its neighbor, the South Miami-Dade Landfill.|$|E
