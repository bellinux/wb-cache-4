On the west side the cliff is much lower and has a deep capping of boulder clay over a sandstone base making it less stable and liable to <b>slippage.</b> Both cliffs are being eroded quite rapidly.|$|E

The road finally opened {{on the evening of}} 19 August 2015, costing £20.4M in total, of which Sefton Council funded £5.9M (approximately 30%) of the cost.|$|E

The collapse of the walls was a consequence of the instability of the topsoil on top of the limestone spur, which was a mixture of clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and liable to crack.|$|E
5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when <b>slippage</b> in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel <b>slippage.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite {{not having}} a sting, the {{porcupine}} ray is capable of injuring humans with its many sharp thorns. It is reportedly bold and tolerant of being approached closely underwater. The tough, thorny skin of this ray, made into a form of leather called shagreen, had many historical uses. In particular, {{it was used to}} cover the hilts of various melee weapons, as its extremely rough texture prevented <b>slippage</b> during battle. For example, the Japanese deemed it the only species whose skin was acceptable for covering sword grips. The Malayans used it to cover shields. The skin was also used ornamentally, such as by the Chinese, who dyed it and ground down the thorns to yield a mottled pattern. The native inhabitants of Funafuti Atoll used dried portions of the ray's tail as a rasp-like tool.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} {{blamed the}} failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics {{company had been}} severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule <b>slippage</b> and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.|$|E

40|$|Massively {{multiplayer}} online games (MMOGs) currently {{represent the}} most widely used type of social 3 D virtual worlds with millions of users worldwide. Although MMOGs take face-to-face conversation as their metaphor for user-to-user interaction, avatars currently give off much less information about what users are doing than real human bodies. Consequently, users routinely encounter <b>slippages</b> in coordination when engaging in joint courses of action. In this study, we analyze screen-capture video of user-to-user interaction in the game, City of Heroes, under two conditions: one with the game’s standard awareness cues and the other with enhanced cues. We use conversation analysis to demonstrate interactional <b>slippages</b> caused by the absence of awareness cues, user practices that circumvent such limitations and ways in which enhanced cues can enable tighter coordination.

25|$|A {{microsatellite}} is a {{tract of}} repetitive DNA in which certain DNA motifs (ranging in length from 1–6 or more base pairs) are repeated, typically 5–50 times. Microsatellites occur at thousands of locations within an organism's genome. They {{have a higher}} mutation rate than other areas of DNA DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for reading DNA during replication, can slip while moving along the template strand and continue at the wrong nucleotide. DNA polymerase <b>slippage</b> {{is more likely to}} occur when a repetitive sequence (such as CGCGCG) is replicated. Because microsatellites consist of such repetitive sequences, DNA polymerase may make errors at a higher rate in these sequence regions. Several studies have found evidence that <b>slippage</b> is the cause of microsatellite mutations. Typically, <b>slippage</b> in each microsatellite occurs about once per 1,000 generations. Thus, <b>slippage</b> changes in repetitive DNA are three orders of magnitude more common than point mutations {{in other parts of the}} genome. Most <b>slippage</b> results in a change of just one repeat unit, and <b>slippage</b> rates vary for different allele lengths and repeat unit sizes, and within different species. If there is a large size difference between individual alleles, then there may be increased instability during recombination at meiosis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Although {{researchers}} have studied various parameters that affect grip force, few studies investigate {{the effects of}} tactile sensation on pinch force. This study aims to determine the influences of tactile sensation on pinch force with a special emphasis on screw knobs under loaded and unloaded conditions. The participants included 32 manual workers who were required to pinch and turn the knobs to generate pinch force under reduced and increased sensations simulated using cotton and nitrile gloves. The data were analysed using the analysis of variance via Minitab 16. Results show that the pinch force exerted for reduced sensations is {{higher than that of}} increased sensations because the reduced friction increased skin-object <b>slippages,</b> which caused participants to spontaneously increase their force to prevent <b>slippages.</b> This study serves as a guideline to potentially improve the design of objects operated with pinch grips to be safe and suitable for manual, sedentary or general tasks...|$|R
