40|$|Fundamental {{weakness}} of the tank model application is so much value parameters must firstbe defined simultaneously before the model was applied. This condition causes tank models areconsidered not efficient to solve practical problems. This research {{is an attempt to}} improve theperformance of <b>Standard</b> <b>Tank</b> Model that can be applied more effectively, especially for thetransformation of climate data into the stream data. The discussion focused on efforts to completethe system of equations in <b>standard</b> <b>tank</b> model using genetic algorithms for optimization parameters,so that the resulting equation system can determine the appropriate model parameters automaticallyat a watershed in the study. <b>Standard</b> <b>tank</b> model is a system composed tank 4 series and has 17 parameters. Results of research on the Konto Watershed and the Lekso Watershed show thatStandard Tank Model-based Genetic Algorithm can present relationships very well climate data andstreams data. At the maximum generation value of 500 obtained root mean square error (RMSE) of 0. 241 m 3 /sec for the Konto Watershed and the Lekso Watershed of 0. 30 m 3 /sec...|$|R

50|$|The Fiat 3000 was {{the first}} tank to be {{produced}} in series in Italy. It {{was to be the}} <b>standard</b> <b>tank</b> of the emerging Italian armored units after World War I. The 3000 was based on the French Renault FT.|$|R
50|$|The FT was the {{ancestor}} {{of a long}} line of French tanks: the FT Kégresse, the NC1, the NC2, the Char D1, and the Char D2. The Italians produced the FIAT 3000, a moderately close copy of the FT, as their <b>standard</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some <b>standard</b> <b>tanks</b> classes {{operated}} on the line, {{the most powerful}} being the standard class 4 2-6-4T in the 80XXX series; these had one disadvantage, in that the water tanks extended along the cabside and this prevented the fitting of the Whitaker tablet exchange mechanism there.|$|R

50|$|They were {{designed}} {{in light of}} problems that more <b>standard</b> <b>tanks</b> experienced during the amphibious Dieppe Raid, so that the new models {{would be able to}} overcome the problems of the planned Invasion of Normandy. These tanks played a major part on the Commonwealth beaches during the landings. They were forerunners of the modern combat engineering vehicle and were named after their commander, Major General Percy Hobart.|$|R

50|$|Flame {{tanks were}} not {{necessarily}} more prone to catching fire or exploding, unless hit with an armor piercing round or explosive reaching the ammunition and fuel inside. Tanks such as the Churchill 'Crocodile', which towed the liquid container behind the actual tank, held no greater risk of fire than <b>standard</b> <b>tanks.</b> Although the towed container itself could be easily targeted, the tank and its crew were generally well protected.|$|R
50|$|The 7TP (siedmiotonowy polski - 7-tonne Polish) was a Polish light tank of the Second World War. A {{development}} of the British Vickers 6-ton, it was significantly better armed than its most common opponents, the German Panzer I and Panzer II. A <b>standard</b> <b>tank</b> of the Polish Army during the 1939 Invasion of Poland, its production never exceeded 150 vehicles. Its chassis {{was used as the}} base for C7P artillery tractor.|$|R

The heavy <b>tanks</b> <b>mean</b> that {{a relatively low}} pressure is optimal, limiting engine power, but all the fuel is burned, allowing high efficiency. The pressurant used is frequently helium due to its lack of reactivity and low density. Examples: AJ-10, used in the Space Shuttle OMS, Apollo SPS, and {{the second stage of}} the Delta II.|$|R
50|$|Some Merkava tanks {{have been}} fitted with full medical and {{ambulance}} capabilities while retaining their armament (but carrying less ammunition than the <b>standard</b> <b>tank).</b> The cabin area has been converted for carrying injured personnel and has had two stretchers and life support medical station systems added with a full medical team complement to operate under combat conditions with a Merkava battalion. The vehicle has a rear door to facilitate evacuation under fire, and can provide covering fire.|$|R

The export Californian was readily recognisable by its roof and seats, trimmed in [...] "Op-pop verve" [...] black and white tiger striped vinyl or [...] "Orange Bali" [...] vinyl, which looked rather like a fruit salad, and was briefly marketed to the [...] "flower power" [...] culture in the United States.|$|R
25|$|In 1953, an Israeli {{delegation}} visited France {{to examine}} the new AMX 13 light tank. The tank was armed with the high-velocity 75mm gun CN 75-50. While the gun was satisfactory, the armor of the French tank was considered too light. Eventually, Israel did purchase the AMX 13, however in a parallel development {{it was decided to}} graft the powerful French gun onto the available, familiar and better-armored hull of the American M4 Sherman, the <b>standard</b> <b>tank</b> of the IDF armored units in the early 1950s.|$|R

25|$|After 123 {{production}} aircraft {{had been built}} a number of improvements {{were made to the}} 112 in 1974, producing the 112A. The doors were fixed by replacing them with new aluminum units, which added still more weight, but had the added benefit of making the cabin quieter. The wing was redesigned internally with increased fuel capacity and a 100lb increase in maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) to 2,650lb; After another 30 112s were built, Rockwell offered an option for increased fuel capacity (68 US gallon vs. 48 gallon <b>standard</b> <b>tanks).</b>|$|R
50|$|A tank {{container}} can be loaded and unloaded {{from the top}} and the bottom. On a <b>standard</b> <b>tank</b> container there is a manhole {{and at least one}} valve on the top, and there is a valve at the bottom. Loading and unloading is done by connecting hoses of the loading and unloading facility to the valves of the tank. The loading or unloading is often done using a pump. Depending on the installation and regulation of certain products, it is determined how the {{tank container}} should be loaded or unloaded.|$|R
50|$|A tank container, {{also known}} as ISO tank, is a {{specialized}} type of container designed to carry bulk liquids, such as chemicals, liquid hydrogen, gases and foodgrade products. Both hazardous and non hazardous products can be shipped in <b>tank</b> containers. A <b>standard</b> <b>tank</b> container is 20 ft long, 8 ft high and 8 ft wide. The tank, which is made from stainless steel, is held within a box-shaped frame with the same shape as an intermodal container. This allows it to be carried on multiple modes of transport, such as truck, rail and ship.|$|R
