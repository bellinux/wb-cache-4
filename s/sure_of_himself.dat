5|$|Protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam {{struck a}} deal with Look {{magazine}} in 1956 to tell their story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them believed they were guilty or that they had done anything wrong.|$|E
25|$|Il trionfo del tempo e del disinganno, an allegory, Handel's first oratorio was {{composed}} in Italy in 1707, followed by La resurrezione in 1708 which uses {{material from the}} Bible. The circumstances of Esther and its first performance, possibly in 1718, are obscure. Another 12 years had passed when an act of piracy caused him to take up Esther once again. Three earlier performances aroused such interest that they naturally prompted the idea of introducing it to a larger public. Next came Deborah, strongly coloured by the Coronation Anthems and Athaliah, his first English Oratorio. In these three oratorios Handel {{laid the foundation for}} the traditional use of the chorus which marks his later oratorios. Handel became <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> broader in his presentation, and more diverse in his composition.|$|E

500|$|Season {{three of}} Seinfeld, an American {{television}} series created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, began airing on September 18, 1991 on NBC, a U.S. broadcast television network. It comprises 23 episodes and concluded its initial airing on May 6, 1992. [...] "The Tape", [...] "The Pen", and [...] "The Letter" [...] {{are some of}} the season's episodes that were inspired by the writers' own experiences. Co-creator Larry David admits that season three was a big turning point for the series in terms of how the show was made; it’s where the writers started doing non linear storylines with episodes containing multiple stories. George was becoming a bigger liar, Elaine was becoming more quirky, and Kramer was becoming <b>surer</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> throughout his crazy antics. This season received eight Emmy nominations and one Directors Guild of America Award.|$|R
2500|$|With this (half-uttered) blasphemy, {{everything}} is lost. Feeling himself expelled from Heaven, Dan reawakens as Dionis, and catches {{a glimpse of}} the singing girl: [...] "Ophelia" [...] is Dan's Maria. Still confused by his apparent change of status, and not being <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> Dionis decides to write her a letter, confessing his affection. When, from the window, she shows him that the letter has impressed her, Dionis faints with emotion. He is carried to hospital by concerned philanthropists and makes a slow recovery, while Maria secretly arranges to have his room cleaned and refurbished. Dionis wakes up in a beautified home, with Maria watching over him. They become lovers.|$|E
2500|$|In the end, he {{was almost}} too <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself.</b> He was quoted as saying, [...] "They will write books and make movies about my time here." [...] His 1995 team started out well, {{reaching}} the top 10 after a 3–0 start. However, an embarrassing loss to Colorado on national television started a downward spiral. The Sooners ultimately finished 5–5–1, including only their second losing conference record since World War II. Schnellenberger resigned {{a month after the}} season ended. To this day, Schnellenberger is not held in high esteem by Sooner fans, in part because he made no secret of his lack of interest in the program's history. For instance, he vowed to make [...] "Sooner Nation" [...] forget about Wilkinson and Switzer—a boast considered to be almost heretical by the fan base. He ordered numerous old files to be thrown out; instead, they were archived without his knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|In 1915, Lewis briefly {{returned}} to song and dance, supporting Gaby Deslys in a revue written for her by J. M. Barrie, Rosy Rapture at the Duke of York's. [...] 1916 saw Lewis in Please Help Emily by H. M. Harwood at the Playhouse Theatre and The Hawk by Edward Knoblock at the Royalty Theatre. [...] In 1917, he {{was featured in}} The Double Event by Sydney Blow and Douglas Hoare at The Queen's Theatre and H. V. Esmond's Salad Days at the London Pavilion. [...] The next year, he played in Monica's Blue Boy by Arthur Wing Pinero at the New Theatre and The Man from Toronto by Douglas Murray at the Royalty. [...] Even so, late in Lewis's career, The Times commented (in {{the midst of a}} very favourable review of the play), that Lewis [...] "is always <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> always sound, suave, brightly polished. [...] are more entertaining than the main story." [...] In 1919, he appeared in Kiddies by John L. Hobble at the Royalty.|$|E
60|$|This plan {{seemed to}} have advantages. No one would {{continue}} to hunt for the treasure. No one except himself and perhaps Black Meg would know that Foy van Goorl and Martin had been on board the Swallow and escaped; indeed as yet he was not quite <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> it <b>himself.</b> For the rest he could either lie hidden, or if it proved desirable, announce that he still lived. Even if his messenger should prove faithless and tell the truth, it would not greatly matter, seeing that he knew nothing which could be of service to anybody.|$|R
5000|$|Rachel Chesbrough of XXL stated, [...] "In {{some ways}} Cadillactica is the Big K.R.I.T. we already know. He’s fearless in his content; unafraid {{to talk about}} (and even equate) both the {{material}} and the philosophical. It’s The South ‘til death, and underground at that. In maybe more ways though, this is K.R.I.T. evolved. Lyrically he’s never sounded <b>surer</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> and his beat selection proves {{we have nothing to}} worry about when he relinquishes some of that control. The album is incredibly dense, packed past capacity with metaphors, even for a concept album. Even without much mainstream appeal, K.R.I.T.’S relatability keeps it accessible, and ultimately, Cadillactica proves to be something the game barely knew it needed. Consider the gauntlet thrown." [...] Michael Madden of Consequence of Sound said, [...] "What makes Cadillactica arguably his best full-length to date is that he’s never sounded more determined to chart every foot - or every layer of atmosphere - in between." [...] Logan Smithson of PopMatters stated, [...] "Cadillactica stands on its own as a deviation in sound but a continuation of greatness. An intriguing concept, exceptional production, and captivating lyricism ensure that a trip to Cadillactica is one that will stick with you for life." ...|$|R

This is not surprising, for the peculiar Englishman was not quite <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> that point <b>himself!</b> ...|$|R
2500|$|Wesley is {{introduced}} in Angel having been {{fired from the}} Watcher's Council. Denisof says the experience gave the character [...] "a little shake". He elaborates, When he arrived in Sunnydale, he was straight out of Watcher grad school; he lacked practical experience. He {{was living in the}} ideal of the perfect way to execute his duties. I think that losing his job and going out alone roughened him up a little, lopped off some of his sharper corners. It made him more approachable and more personable, less <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> all the time. [...] Coming into the show immediately following the death of Doyle, Wesley serves as a partial replacement for that character. Comparing the two characters, Denisof states, [...] "Wesley is a clearer counterpart to Angel, whereas Doyle had more street smarts. Although [...] was struggling with his demon nature, he had seen a lot more of the world in the same way Angel had." [...] Nonetheless Denisof believes that in this period, his character [...] "was so anxious to be a tough rogue demon hunter but was clearly a kind of soft puppy dog." ...|$|E

25|$|In the Matrix, the Agents {{interrogate}} Morpheus in {{an attempt}} to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, the rebel humans' last refuge in the real world. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo, who believes that he is not the One, resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus; Trinity insists on accompanying him. They rescue Morpheus, and in so doing, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith thwarts Neo's escape. Now <b>surer</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> Neo fights Smith as a near equal and defeats him, but Smith's nature as an Agent allows him to survive. Neo flees the converging Agents and locates an exit in the hotel from which Trinity had escaped earlier, but Smith shoots him dead. In the real world, machines known as Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar, while Trinity whispers to Neo that the Oracle told her that she would {{fall in love with the}} One, and that Neo cannot be dead because she loves him. She kisses Neo, and he revives, this time with the power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith and leaves the Matrix in time for the ship's electromagnetic pulse weapon to disable the attacking Sentinels.|$|R

He will rush headlong upon his foes, however {{numerous}} they may be, and however formidably armed. He makes his own destruction sure, it is true, but, at the same time, he renders almost inevitable the destruction of some one or more of his enemies, and, in going out to attack him, no one can be <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> not becoming <b>himself</b> one <b>of</b> the victims of his fury.|$|R

60|$|We had {{next the}} police to tackle--a more {{difficult}} business. Still, even they were reasonable. They had caught Colonel Clay, they believed, but their chance of convicting him depended entirely upon Charles's identification, with mine to back it. The more they urged the necessity of arresting the female confederates, however, the more stoutly did Charles declare that for his part he could by no means make <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> Colonel Clay <b>himself,</b> while he utterly declined to give evidence of any sort against either of the women. It was a difficult case, he said, and he felt far from confident even about the man. If his decision faltered, and he failed to identify, the case was closed; no jury could convict with nothing to convict upon.|$|R

60|$|At last he rose {{to stretch}} himself, and almost {{as he did so}} a fresh sound from outside {{attracted}} his notice. A motor-car had turned into the Terrace. He walked to the uncurtained window and stood there, <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> being <b>himself</b> unseen. Then his heart gave a great leap. Unemotional though he was, this was a happening which might well have excited a more phlegmatic individual. A motor-car which he remembered very well, although it was driven now by a man in dark livery, had stopped at the next house. A woman and two men had descended. Tavernake never glanced at the latter; his eyes were fastened upon their companion. She was wrapped in a long cloak, but she lifted her skirts as she crossed the pavement, and he saw the flash of her silver buckles. Her carriage, her figure, were unmistakable. It was Elizabeth who was paying this early morning visit next door! Already the little party had disappeared. They did not even ring the bell. The door must have been opened silently at their coming. The motor-car glided off. Once more the Terrace was deserted.|$|R

60|$|December 1846.--Henry Fletcher and I dined at the Mount on the 21st of this month. The party {{consisted}} of Mr. Crabb Robinson (their Christmas guest), Mrs. Arnold, Miss Martineau, and ourselves. My mother's cold was too bad {{to allow her}} to go, which I regretted, as it was, like all their little meetings, most sociable and agreeable. Wordsworth was much pleased with a little notice of his new edition in the Examiner; he thought it very well done. He expressed himself very sweetly at dinner on the pleasant terms of neighbourly kindness we enjoyed in the valleys. It will be pleasant in after times to remember his words, and still more his manner when he said this, it was done with such perfect simplicity and equality of feeling, without the slightest reference to self, and I am <b>sure</b> without thinking <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> at the time as more than one of the little circle whose friendly feeling he was commending.|$|R
60|$|With Mountjoy Scarborough {{there had}} never come such a moment, and never could; yet he had been very confident, so that he had lived on the {{assurance}} that such a moment would come. And the self-deportment natural to her had been such that he had shown his assurance. He never would have succeeded; but he should not the less love her sincerely. And {{when the time came}} for him to think what he should do with himself, those few days after his father's death, he turned to her as his one prospect of salvation. If his cousin Florence would be good to him all might yet be well. He had come by that time to lose his assurance. He had recognized Harry Annesley as his enemy, as has been told often enough in these pages. Harry was to him a hateful stumbling-block. And he had not been quite as <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> her fidelity to another as Harry had been <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> it to <b>himself.</b> Tretton might prevail. Trettons do so often prevail. And the girl's mother was all on his side. So he had gone to Cheltenham, true as the needle to the pole, to try his luck yet once again. He had gone to Cheltenham, and there he found Harry Annesley. All hopes for him were then over and he started at once for Monaco; or, as he himself told himself, for the devil.|$|R

5000|$|In Soap Opera, Ralph Pape's one-act play, {{the actress}} Julienne Greer looks {{directly}} at the audience and says with total conviction, [...] "I could have just about any man I want these days," [...] and adds, [...] "It's great." [...] Formerly ignored by her office mates, the character has forcibly changed her image. She is proof that self-confidence {{is the first step}} to altering the attitude of others. Ms. Greer exudes sensual awareness as she tells the story of her new life of carnality. That story is the first of three interwoven narratives in Mr. Pape's play. The others in this so-called triologue are delivered by her lover and another woman. As the three take turns addressing the audience -- and never make contact with one another onstage -- a romance unfolds. At first, the play seems straightforward. Gradually it becomes devious and finally it veers toward melodrama. In a play in which every earlier step is carefully plotted and orchestrated, the end is too wide a leap. But until that point, Mr. Pape (author of the play Say Goodnight, Gracie) is, like his heroine, in <b>sure</b> command <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> leading theatergoers deeper into his playwright's snare. The cast and the director, Elizabeth Franzen, are his knowing accomplices in this tale of desire gone awry, with Shannon Malone as an artist attracted to both sexes; Gerard J. Schneider as a mechanic who finds <b>himself</b> the center <b>of</b> womanly attention, and, particularly, Ms. Greer. She creates a corrosive portrait of a wallflower turned black widow spider, playing upon male self-doubts and luxuriating in her own vanity. In this Soap Opera, all appearances are deceptive.|$|R
