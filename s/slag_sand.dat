Three typical methods-chemical analysis method, steam powdering ratio and mortar bar linear {{expansion rate}} under hot-water curing condition are compared in this investigation. The results showed that though chemical analysis method could rapidly judge the volume stability, the content of free CaO and MgO wasn’t precise because of the interference of calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide in aging steel slag sand; the maximum powdering ratio reflected the uneven distribution of expansion components; mortar bar expansion rate visually presented the volume stability of steel <b>slag</b> <b>sand</b> when used in mortar or concrete.

Joint fillers included in the tests comprised five innovative (iron <b>slag</b> <b>sand,</b> polymeric bound sand and three sodium silicate enriched fillers) and eight standard joint fillers (four fine materials, for example, sea sand, white sand, sandstone and fine limestone, and four coarse materials based on porphyry and limestone). Their ability to suppress weeds was investigated by examining seedling emergence and biomass production of seven test species in pure or organically polluted (5 %, 10 %, 20 %, 40 % and 80 % compost by volume) filler substrate. Selected test species were dominant, hard-to-control weeds found on pavements.

40|$|Abstract. People often mix {{superplasticizer}} and particulate {{to increase}} the density of high-concrete, but ignoring the effect of coarse aggregate gradation on concrete strength. Referring to several Gradation Theories, this paper selects the coarse aggregate gradation with skeleton, uses uniform design method to test the compressive strength of high-strength concrete, and analyses the test results. It can be known from the test results of 7 d and 28 d concrete specimen that the concrete strength decreases linearly with water-cement ratio and sand ratio; The 7 d’s concrete strength has higher variability due to low water-cement ratio with superplasticizer; The coarse aggregate skeleton is interfered by the increase of steel <b>slag</b> and <b>sand</b> rate, and the concrete strength decreases with limited cement paste. Furthermore, the steel slag with less than 30 % addition has little effect on concrete strength and it can increase the cement’s possibility of contacting to water, and {{reduce the amount of}} cement without lowering the concrete strength. The influential degree on the compressive strength of concrete is followed by ascending sequence of steel <b>slag</b> content, <b>sand</b> ratio and water-cement.

40|$|Thin low viscous plate slags, the {{so-called}} Plattenschlacke, {{are one of}} the 3 types of slags systematically encountered at Middle and Late Bronze Age copper smelting sites in the Alps. The two other types are coarse cake-like slags, and finely crushed <b>slag</b> <b>sand.</b> The exact origin of these different types of slags within the smelting process, and particularly that of the Plattenschlacke is still debated: do they belong to the same unique smelting step, or do they refer to separate operations? With respect to this issue, the Early Bronze Age (EBA) copper production site of Saint-Véran (Hautes-Alpes, France), one of the earliest copper mass production centre in the Alps, occupies an exceptional situation. Indeed, it provides not only one of the first evidence of Plattenschlacke in the Alps, but also Plattenschlacke is the only type of slags produced there. This paper aims at exploring further the "Plattenschlacke mystery" by proposing a reconstruction of the smelting process performed at Saint-Véran during the EBA, on the basis of thorough analytical investigation of the local Plattenschlacke.

This method is utilized to correct the particle size distribution of various sands used in mortar. For this investigation, three sands have been used: a dune sand (DS), a <b>slag</b> <b>sand</b> (SS), and brick sand (BS) at different proportions in mortar. After crushing, the artificial fine aggregate (blast furnace slag and waste brick fine aggregate) was sifted {{in order to use}} it as fine aggregate. The effect of the quality and grain size distribution of natural fine aggregate (i. e., DS) and artificial fine aggregates (i. e., SS and BS) on the physical properties of ternary sand confected (density, porosity, fineness modulus, equivalent sand, particle size distribution, water absorption) and properties of fresh and hardened mortar were analysed. In the same way for this study, the physical properties and chemical compositions of DS, SS, BS and cement were investigated. The results obtained show that the mechanical strength on mortar depends of the nature and particle size distribution of sand studied. The reuse of this recycled material (slag blast furnace and waste brick) in the industry would contribute to the protection of the environment. This study shows the potential of this method to make mortar with ternary sand (natural and artificial fine aggreagates) in order to improve the physical properties of sand.

The test results revealed that the characteristics of fine and coarse aggregate materials {{play an important role}} in controlling the drying shrinkage property of mortar and concrete, respectively. Limestone sand and blast furnace <b>slag</b> <b>sand</b> can restrain the drying shrinkage of mortar specimens about 22 % and 30 %, respectively, compared to the case of mortar incorporating standard sand. The drying shrinkage strain of concrete specimens proportionally increases with the increase of aggregate shrinkage strain, specific surface area and 6 – 30 nm in diameter pore volume of aggregates, which implies the significant influence of aggregate characteristics on drying shrinkage development in concrete. It was also found that the drying shrinkage property in concrete can be affected by the static modulus of elasticity and total amount of water content, in which the water absorption ratio, unit mass of aggregate and unit water content were considered. Finally, the experimental results presented are useful information for providing a good perspective for the concrete mixture design practices taking into consideration that concrete drying shrinkage could be controlled by appropriate aggregate characteristics and reducing the total amount of water content...|$|E

The {{focus of}} the present paper is to {{investigate}} {{the effect of the}} activating solution on the structure and mechanical properties of inorganic polymers synthesised from a slag resembling the vitrified residue from a Waste-to-Energy plasma installation. The slag consists of (in wt. %) 22 CaO, 12 Al 2 O 3, 34 SiO 2 and 20 Fe 2 O 3 and the activation solution was 50 : 50 mass ratio NaOH and sodium silicate, with the NaOH solution molarities varying from 2 M to 10 M. The synthesised slag was almost completely amorphous due to the rapid cooling, with only traces of magnetite and quartz. The inorganic polymers were prepared by mixing the <b>slag,</b> <b>sand</b> and activation solution. In all cases, heat was generated during sample preparation and its amount increased with the activating solution strength. After 90 days, the compressive strength of the samples activated with 6 M or higher NaOH solutions was similar, approximately 88 MPa. For NaOH activation solutions with molarities lower than 6 M, the compressive strength was lower, both at early as well as late curing times.

The numerical {{value of the}} FAA is the voids in the mineral aggregate of the loosely packed fine aggregate. Use of FAA has been predicted on the philosophy that higher and lower values of FAA represent fine aggregate with high and low frictional characteristics, respectively.

Higher friction is associated with increased rutting resistance. ^ Fine aggregate angularity levels used in the Superpave system are below 40, 40 to 45 and above 45. The higher values are specified for layers near the surface and for higher traffic levels. Past and current experience shows that there are fine aggregates in mixtures performing well that are below the specified levels. There are also aggregates above these levels in mixtures that are not performing as desired.
