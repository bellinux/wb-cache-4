50|$|The term {{is usually}} a misnomer, {{introduced}} mostly by Fender whose guitars traditionally had what is called bolt-on necks. Real bolted joints (i.e., using bolt coupled with a nut) exist—particularly in acoustic guitars—but are less common in electric guitars. However, at least one aftermarket manufacturer offers a replacement for Fender neckplates and screws that uses captive inserts—embedded in the guitar body {{by means of an}} external <b>self-tapping</b> <b>thread</b> — and M4 machine screws. The maker claims this permits a higher fastening torque than ordinary wood screws, and hence a better coupling between neck and body.|$|E
40|$|Implant-based {{anchorage}} in orthodontics {{is increasingly}} obtaining significance. In this study, implants were temporarily {{inserted into the}} mid-palatal and the mandibular retromolar areas in humans for orthodontic anchorage. Histological analysis of the implant-bone interface was performed following the retrieval of implants which were subjected to prolonged oblique orthodontic loading. The results of the histomorphometric evaluation indicated that all the implants serving for orthodontic anchorage were well integrated into the bone despite the prolonged application of the orthodontic loading. Hence, it may be concluded that small-size, one-part transmucosal implants with a <b>self-tapping</b> <b>thread</b> and an SLA surface seemed to provide adequate anchorage for orthodontic therapy. Furthermore, the successful integration and the subsequent oblique loading of these orthodontic implants provide evidence that continuous forces {{in the order of}} magnitude of 2 - 6 N are compatible with the maintenance of osseointegration. © Munksgaard 1998. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} fixture design and surface on the early bone formation around immediately loaded implants inserted in the human posterior maxilla. Materials and Methods. Ten totally edentulous subjects received two transitional implants: one tapered implant with knife-edge threads/nanostructured calcium-incorporated surface (test: Anyridge®, Megagen, Gyeongbuk, South Korea) and one cylindrical implant with self-tapping threads/sandblasted surface (control: EZPlus®, Megagen). The implants were placed according to a split-mouth design and immediately loaded to support an interim complete denture; after 8 weeks, they were removed for histologic/histomorphometric analysis. The bone-to-implant contact (BIC%) and the bone density (BD%) were calculated. The Wilcoxon {{test was used to}} {{evaluate the}} differences. Results. With test implants, a mean BIC% and BD% of 35. 9 (± 9. 1) and 31. 8 (± 7. 5) were found. With control implants, a mean BIC% and BD% of 29. 9 (± 7. 6) and 32. 5 (± 3. 9) were found. The mean BIC% was higher with test implants, but this difference was not significant (p= 0. 16). Similar BD% were found in the two groups (p= 0. 9). Conclusions. In the posterior maxilla, under immediate loading conditions, implants with a knife-edge thread design/nanostructured calcium-incorporated surface seem to increase the peri-implant endosseous healing properties, when compared to implants with <b>self-tapping</b> <b>thread</b> design/sandblasted surface...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{principle}} of the thread fastenings have been known and used for decades. Its long applications become to a common manufacturing {{with the purpose of}} joining one component to another. Recently, the thread fastenings are a common assembly method, which is widely used and popularly applied. Because of the thread fastenings can be permitted easy to reassembly and disassembly for maintenance, repair, relocation, and recycling. Screw insertions are typically carried out manually with having the purpose of joining one component to another. Its is more complex to automate, and hence has admitted relatively very small research attention on automating threaded fastenings, and most automated assembly research is focused on the peg-in-hole assembly problem. This paper investigates the problem of an intelligence control strategy for automated Threaded Fastening process based on an analytical model and on-line parameter estimation. The monitoring problem deals with predicting the integrity of the <b>self-tapping</b> <b>Threaded</b> Fastening process, based on the torque vs. insertion angle curves generated during the insertions. A technique for estimating three unknown parameters during a general <b>self-tapping</b> <b>Threaded</b> Fastening is presented. It is shown that these parameters, required by the mathematical model, can be reliably estimated on-line. Test results are presented to validate procedure. batch production. The approach adopted in this study is to use an analytical model developed by the authors [1 - 4] to predict ideal insertion signals. However, this model requires various fixed process parameters as input, and it is not always possible to know these parameters in advance with sufficient accuracy. Hence the focus of this paper is the on-line parameter estimation during threaded assembly. II. THE THREADED FASTENING PROCESS A. Self-tapping Screw Insertions In [1 - 4] the Threaded Fastening process is described by a torque signature signal. The insertion signal is a two dimensional curve of axial torque Vs insertion depth. The axial torque is necessary to drive the screw through the hole as the insertion develops...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to adopt the Johansen’s {{yielding}} theory as a possibility to predict the ultimate load for timber-to-concrete joints using <b>self-tapping</b> <b>threaded</b> connectors screwed at an angle into the wood. The ultimate loadbearing capacity of a single connector is predicted to be when either the stresses in the wood reach the plastic failure stress level or when a combination of plastic failure in wood and dowel is attained. K. W. Johansen assumed that no axial tension occurred in the dowel and, thus no frictional contribution affected the lateral load-bearing capacity. However, the joints with inclined fasteners are first affected by tension load, so the withdrawal capacity of the screws has to be taken into account. In order to determine the load bearing capacity for specific connector geometry, the kinematical possible failure modes are determined. The screw in the concrete part of connection was taken as rigidly embedded and thus no deformations appeared. The study showed that the load-bearing capacity for connections with inclined high tensile strength screws can be predicted using the yielding theory, but this theory was unable to predict precisely the failure mode. Possible reasons for that include limited fastener ductility and influence of the screw inclination on the strength properties of timber...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} a long-standing {{challenge}} to achieve successful osseointegration of implants in older population with poor bone mass and low bone turnover rates. Therefore, an ideal implant should have a surface which is conducive to osseointegration regardless of the implant site, bone quality, and bone quantity. A large body of literature recommends the use of mini dental implants for stabilization of removable partial and complete dentures in selected situations [2].The 3 M™ESPE™ mini dental implant (MDI) system makes use of a <b>self-tapping</b> <b>threaded</b> screw design and needs a minimal surgical intervention. Also, small-size implants {{have been widely used}} for orthodontic anchorage [3 – 5], single tooth replacements [6, 7], fixing the surgical guides for definitive implant placement [8], and as transitional implants for the support of interim removable prosthesis during the healing phase of final fixtures [9, 10]. The MDIs have several advantages over the regular implants used for overdentures such as, simpler surgical protocol and minimally invasive surgery, and they can often be loaded immediately [6]. This helps in reducing postoperative distress to the patient and minimizing resorption of the bone during healing [11]. It has been shown that bone healing around immediately loaded transitional implants is not disturbed and causes no bone loss, which represents a solution for patients who have ridge deficiency and who cannot have surgery for medical reasons [12, 13]. Mini dental implants are also cost-effective, and the price of one MDI is 3.5 times lower than that of a standard size mandibular implant [14].|$|R
40|$|<b>Self-tapping</b> {{continuously}} <b>threaded</b> screws can {{be installed}} without predrilling and have – besides their use as fasteners – proven suitable as high-performance reinforcements of structural members and joints in timber construction. For this type of application big installation depths (leff > 20 d) and screw lengths (l > 0. 6 m) are required which cause problems regarding precisely positioned installation. Due to the inhomogeneity of wood as a natural material, even at medium size lengths the screws tend to 'stray' i. e. a deviation of the screw tip from the designated axis occurs which is increasing disproportionately with growing screw lengths. While for shorter screws mechanically drilled holes are commonly used as guidance, for longer screws potentially only laser-drilled holes can ensure a straight direction of the screw axis. The high energy and heat input of the laser beam results in a thermal modification of the wood around the drill hole, thus presumably influencing the load bearing and bond behaviour of screws that are screwed into such holes. The Chair of Structures and Structural Design and the Chair of Laser Technology of RWTH Aachen University carried {{out a series of}} tests to examine the use of laser radiation to drill holes in glued laminated timber and to evaluate the load bearing behaviour of self-tapping screws installed in these holes focussing on short drill-/bond lengths (l = 6 d). The results point out the potential of the development of this innovative wood processing method for the field of timber construction...|$|R
40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of timber structures is largely {{governed by the}} design and effectiveness of the connections. Connections with long axially loaded <b>self-tapping</b> screws or <b>threaded</b> rods embedded with an inclination to the grain direction can be an alternative to connections with dowel-type fasteners or glued-in rods. Self-tapping screws and especially threaded rods with large diameters feature high withdrawal capacity and stiffness. This ability makes them suitable as fasteners in connections in order to realize stiff and strong joints. Eurocode 5 does not provide rules for the estimation of the withdrawal stiffness of axially loaded fasteners, which {{is necessary for the}} determination of the stiffness of connections. Some rules can be found in technical approvals; however they are only valid for the instantaneous withdrawal stiffness under service load of self-tapping screws with small diameters. Consequently, there is a complete lack of guidelines for the estimation of the withdrawal stiffness of threaded rods with larger diameters. Moreover, Eurocode 5 imposes a limitation to the angle between the rod-axis and the grain direction (α ≥ 30 °) without taking into account that splitting may be prevented by reinforcement. The lack of knowledge of proper design, documentation of mechanical behaviour, design guidelines and design codes for threaded rods are barriers for the development of timber connections with these fasteners. The withdrawal properties (capacity and stiffness) of axially loaded threaded rods were investigated in the present thesis by use of experimental, analytical and numerical methods. An overview of the background information and research on withdrawal of screws and threaded rods is presented in Part I of the present thesis. Part II consists of 4 appended papers where the findings of this Ph. D. project are presented. Part III consists of 3 appendices where some analytical remarks together with the detailed experimental and numerical results are presented. The review on the existing approaches and experimental results have shown that, up-to-date, most research effort has been devoted on the determination of the withdrawal strength of self-tapping screws with diameters up to 12 - 14 mm. On the contrary, available research results for threaded rods with larger diameters are sparse {{and the vast majority of}} these results are limited to relatively stocky rods embedded either parallel or perpendicular to the grain. Therefore, the effect of the rod-to-grain angle and the embedment length on the withdrawal properties remains unknown. The parameters of the experimental investigation were the rod-to-grain angle (α = 0 - 90 °) and the embedment length (l = 100 - 600 mm). Specimens with single rods and with a pair of rods (arranged in a row perpendicular to the plane of the grain) embedded in glued-laminated timber (abbr. glulam) elements were tested. Moreover, an analytical approach based on Volkersen theory and a bi-linear constitutive relationship was used for the estimation of the elastic and post-elastic withdrawal properties. Finally, Finite Element (abbr. FE) simulations were performed to estimate the instantaneous withdrawal stiffness (under service load) and the elastic distributions of stresses and displacements. According to experimental observation, the specimens exhibited high withdrawal capacity and stiffness (without initial soft response). Based on the experimental results, the necessary input parameters for the analytical method were quantified. In particular, simple expressions for the mean and 5...|$|R
