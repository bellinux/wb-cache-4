5|$|The {{strategies}} that sailfish and thresher sharks employ against shoaling fish {{are more effective}} when the shoal is first concentrated into a ‘bait ball’ (Helfman, Collette & Facey, 1997; Oliver et al., 2013; Domenici et al., 2014). Since this is difficult for individual predators to achieve, they cooperate in this effort. When herding a <b>shoal</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> or squid, sailfish also raise their sails to make themselves appear larger. When they slash or wipe their bills through shoaling fish by turning their heads, their dorsal sail and fins are outstretched to stabilize their bodies hydrodynamically (Lauder & Drucker, 2004). Domenici et al. (2014) postulate that these fin extensions enhance the accuracy of tapping and slashing. The sail can reduce yaw rotation by counteracting the lateral force in the direction opposite to the slash. This means that prey {{is less likely to}} recognize the massive trunk as being part of an approaching predator (Marras et al., 2015; Webb & Weihs 2015). Film footage available online impressively demonstrates the hunting strategies of sailfish and thresher sharks.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot {{describes}} {{a journey through}} a child's emotions and anxieties. After befriending the monster, the boy leaves Earth on the creature's back to look for life elsewhere in the galaxy. He hopes {{to find someone to}} relate to. The hollow planet Gravida's surface is patrolled by a creature that complains of stomach pains. This larger creature is followed by several tiny creatures, some of which ride on its back. One of these smaller inhabitants has fallen into the core of Gravida. Though it is isolated and lonely, the creature consoles itself that nobody can harm it. The planet Malaisus is composed of water, with a monster identical to the player's swimming around with a <b>shoal</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish.</b> The monster tells the player to leave. Planet Bibulon has two faces on opposite sides, one angry and one happy. A two-faced creature travels across the surface; one is happy and the other morose. Bibulon is orbited by four moons, each of which has differing opinions on an unnamed man or boy. When players find the planet Debasa, they discover that it is surrounded by a green fog. Gravity is very intense within the fog. Four orbiting satellites produce the fog, which has trapped two boys. Earth shrinks slightly after each planet has been completed. After restoring color to all the surrounding planets, the game is completed by returning to Earth. The Earth has shrunk until it is only slightly larger than the monster; it is destroyed when the boy and his monster land. Both fly upwards and land on the moon, where the boy is free to craft a future of his choosing.|$|E

25|$|Foraging on {{the seabed}} {{typically}} {{takes place at}} depths between 20 and 40 m, although they can dive to depths of 700 m in search of food. Their flexible necks provide {{a wide range of}} movement while they are searching for food on the ocean floor. Some animals have been observed to suck up water and then forcefully expel it to uncover their prey hidden in the silt on the seabed. As their teeth are neither large nor sharp, belugas must use suction to bring their prey into their mouths; it also means their prey has to be consumed whole, which in turn means it cannot be too large or the belugas run the risk of it getting stuck in their throats. They also join together into coordinated groups of five or more to feed on shoals of fish by steering the fish into shallow water, where the belugas then attack them. For example, in the estuary of the Amur River, where they mainly feed on salmon, groups of six or eight individuals join together to surround a <b>shoal</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> and prevent their escape. Individuals then take turns feeding on the fish.|$|E
500|$|A dolphin's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} small fish, crustaceans, and squid. Although this varies by location, many populations share {{an appetite for}} fish from the mullet, the tuna and mackerel, and the drum and croaker families. Its cone-like teeth serve to grasp, but do not chew food. When they encounter a <b>shoal</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> they {{work as a team}} to herd them towards the shore to maximize the harvest. They also hunt alone, often targeting bottom-dwelling species. The bottlenose dolphin sometimes hits a fish with its fluke, sometimes knocking it out of the water, using a strategy called [...] "fish whacking". [...] "Strand feeding", is an inherited feeding technique used by bottlenose dolphins near and around coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. When a pod finds a school of fish, they will circle the school and trap the fish in a mini whirlpool. Then, the dolphins will charge at the school and push their bodies up onto a mud-flat, forcing the fish on the mud-flat, as well. The dolphins then crawl around on their sides, consuming the fish they washed up on shore.|$|E

Gordon Tucker, {{chair of}} the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the University of Birmingham, volunteered his {{services}} as a sonar developer and expert at Loch Ness in 1968.

2500|$|Notorious for {{his defense}} against the pirates, Mangkaw was a known net-fisherman. Already a fishing ground that it is today, Sogod then had houses {{clustered}} close to shore around the watchtower. Being {{an expert in the}} art of casting the net, Laya, he could send out the casting net in a perfect circle in the sea. As the community grew bigger, the residents agitated for a name for their place. Meetings after meetings were held presided by Mangkaw. But every time a meeting is ongoing, a <b>shoal</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> would be seen by the subtle wave of the surface or quick shifting shadow beneath the surface. The eyes of the pondering datu kept stalking it, interfering with the meeting. Satisfying his unequalled fisherman's instinct, he would leave the meeting unattended and his body language was being watched by the attendees, feasting their eyes on the artful slide of the feet of the datu so as not to disturb the surface, his eyes fixed on the school. Then, he shared his catch with the people for the asking, even by strangers. After which, shouts of [...] "Sogod, sogod!" [...] (vernacular for [...] "to begin") would reconvene the meeting. Thus the word [...] "Sogod" [...] became the name of the village then and the town as it is today.|$|E

60|$|The clue {{to all the}} perplexities of law {{and custom}} lies in this, that human {{association}} is an artificiality. We do not run together naturally and easily as grazing deer do or feeding starlings or a <b>shoal</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish.</b> We are a sort of creature which is only resuming association after a long heredity of extreme separation. We are beings strongly individualized, we are dominated by that passion which is no more and no less than individuality in action,--jealousy. Jealousy is a fierce insistence on ourselves, an instinctive intolerance of our fellow-creatures, ranging between an insatiable aggression as its buoyant phase and a savage defensiveness when it is touched by fear. In our expansive moments we want to dominate and control everyone and destroy every unlikeness to ourselves; in our recessive phases our homes are our castles {{and we want to}} be let alone.|$|E
60|$|We had {{approached}} {{within a mile}} and a half perhaps of the foot of the bay, when some of the islanders, who by this time had managed to scramble aboard of us at the risk of swamping their canoes, directed our attention to a singular commotion in the water ahead of the vessel. At first I imagined it to be produced by a <b>shoal</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> sporting on the surface, but our savage friends assured us that it was caused by a shoal of “whinhenies” (young girls), who in this manner were coming off from the shore to welcome us. As they drew nearer, and I watched the rising and sinking of their forms, and beheld the uplifted right arm bearing above the water the girdle of tappa, and their long dark hair trailing beside them as they swam, I almost fancied they could be nothing else than so many mermaids:—and very like mermaids they behaved too.|$|E

60|$|On April 13th the {{southern}} columns were started, but already the British preparations had alarmed the Boers, and Botha, with his main commandos, had slipped south {{across the line}} into that very district from {{which he had been}} so recently driven. Viljoen's commando still remained to the north, and the British troops, pouring in from every side, converged rapidly upon it. The success of the operations was considerable, though not complete. The Tantesberg, which had been the rallying-point of the Boers, was occupied, and Roos-Senekal, their latest capital, was taken, with their State papers and treasure. Viljoen, with a number of followers, slipped through between the columns, but the greater part of the burghers, dashing furiously about like a <b>shoal</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> when they become conscious of the net, were taken by one or other of the columns. A hundred of the Boksburg commando surrendered en masse, fifty more were taken at Roos-Senekal; forty-one of the formidable Zarps with Schroeder, their leader, were captured in the north by the gallantry and wit of a young Australian officer named Reid; sixty more were hunted down by the indefatigable Vialls, leader of the Bushmen. From all parts of the district came the same story of captures and surrenders.|$|E
60|$|Here Strickland lived, coming seldom to Papeete, on {{the produce}} of the land.

Sometimes Strickland would {{go down to the}} reef, and come back with a basket of small, coloured fish that Ata would fry in cocoa-nut oil, or with a lobster; and sometimes she would make a savoury dish of the great land-crabs that scuttled away under your feet. Up the mountain were wild-orange trees, and now and then Ata would go with two or three women from the village and return laden with the green, sweet, luscious fruit. Then the cocoa-nuts would be ripe for picking, and her cousins (like all the natives, Ata had a host of relatives) would swarm up the trees and throw down the big ripe nuts. They split them open {{and put them in the}} sun to dry. Then they cut out the copra and put it into sacks, and the women would carry it down to the trader at the village by the lagoon, and he would give in exchange for it rice and soap and tinned meat and a little money. Sometimes there would be a feast in the neighbourhood, and a pig would be killed. Then they would go and eat themselves sick, and dance, and sing hymns.|$|E
