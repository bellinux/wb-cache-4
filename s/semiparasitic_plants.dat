40|$|Clove {{mistletoe}} (Dendrophthoe pentandra (L.) Miq.) is a <b>semiparasitic</b> <b>plant</b> {{that belongs}} to Loranthaceae family. Clove mistletoe was traditionally used for cancer treatment in Indonesia. In the present study, we examined cytotoxicity of clove mistletoe leaves extracts against brine shrimps and conducted their antiproliferative activity on K 562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia) and MCM-B 2 (canine benign mixed mammary) cancer cell lines in vitro. The tested samples were water extract, ethanol extract, ethanol fraction, ethyl acetate fraction, and n-hexane fraction. Cytotoxicity was screened using Brine Shrimp Lethality Test (BSLT). Antiproliferative activity was conducted using Trypan Blue Dye Method and cells were counted using haemocytometer. The results showed that n-hexane fraction exhibited significant cytotoxicity with LC 50 value of 55. 31 [*]μg/mL. The n-hexane fraction was then considered for further examination. The n-hexane fraction of clove mistletoe could inhibit growth of K 562 and MCM-B 2 cancer cell lines in vitro. The inhibition activity of clove mistletoe n-hexane fraction at concentration of 125 [*]μg/mL on K 562 cancer cell lines was 38. 69 %, while on MCM-B 2 it was 41. 5 %. Therefore, {{it was suggested that}} clove mistletoe had potential natural anticancer activity...|$|R
40|$|Viscum album L. is a <b>semiparasitic</b> <b>plant</b> {{grown on}} trees and widely {{used for the}} {{treatment}} of many diseases in traditional and complementary therapy. It is well known that some activities of Viscum album extracts are varied depending on the host trees, such as antioxidant, apoptosis-inducing, anticancer activities of the plant. The aim of the present study is to examine the comparative effects of methanolic extracts of V. album grown on three different host trees (locust tree, lime tree, and hedge maple tree) on H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage in HeLa cells. Oxidative damage in mitochondrial DNA and two nuclear regions was assessed by QPCR assay. The cells were pretreated with methanolic extracts (10 [*]μg/mL) for 48 [*]h, followed by the treatment with 750 [*]μM H 2 O 2 for 1 hour. DNA damage was significantly induced by H 2 O 2 while it was inhibited by V. album extracts. All extracts completely protected against nuclear DNA damage. While the extract from lime tree or white locust tree entirely inhibited mitochondrial DNA damage, that from hedge maple tree inhibited by only 50 %. These results suggest that methanolic extracts of V. album can prevent oxidative DNA damage, and the activity is dependent on the host tree...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Loranthus parasiticus Merr (L. parasiticus) is {{a member}} of Loranthaceae family and is an {{important}} medicinal plant with a long history of Chinese traditional use. L. parasiticus, also known as Sang Ji Sheng (in Chinese), benalu teh (in Malay) and baso-kisei (in Japanese), is a <b>semiparasitic</b> <b>plant,</b> which is mostly distributed in the southern and southwestern regions of China. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the ethnomedicinal use, phytochemistry and pharmacological activity of L. parasiticus and to highlight the needs for further investigation and greater global development of the plant’s medicinal properties. To date, pharmacological studies have demonstrated significant bio-logical activities, which support the traditional use of the plant as a neuroprotective, tran-quilizing, anticancer, immunomodulatory, antiviral, diuretic and hypotensive agent. In addition, studies have identified antioxidative, antimutagenic, antiviral, antihepatotoxic and antinephrotoxic activity. The key bioactive constituents in L. parasiticus include coriaria lactone comprised of sesquiterpene lactones: coriamyrtin, tutin, corianin, and coriatin. In addition, two proanthocyanidins, namely, AC trimer and (þ) -catechin, have been recently discovered as novel to L. parasiticus. L. parasiticus usefulness as a medicinal plant with current widespread traditional use warrants further research, clinical trials and product development to fully exploit its medicinal value...|$|R
