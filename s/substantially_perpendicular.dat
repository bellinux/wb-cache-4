40|$|To {{probe the}} {{fundamentals}} of membrane/protein interactions, all-atom multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations were conducted on a single transmembrane poly(32) alanine helix in a fully solvated dimyristoyphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayer. The central 12 residues, which interact only with the lipid hydrocarbon chains, maintained a very stable helical structure. Helical regions extended beyond these central 12 residues, but interactions with the lipid fatty-acyl ester linkages, the lipid headgroups, and water molecules made the helix less stable in this region. The C and N termini, exposed largely to water, existed as random coils. As a whole, the helix tilted <b>substantially,</b> from <b>perpendicular</b> to the bilayer plane (0 degree) to a 30 degrees tilt. The helix experienced a bend at its middle, and {{the two halves of}} the helix at times assumed substantially different tilts. Frequent hydrogen bonding, of up to 0. 7 ns in duration, occurred between peptide and lipid molecules. This resulted in correlated translational diffusion between the helix and a few lipid molecules. Because of the large variation in lipid conformation, the lipid environment of the peptide was not well defined in terms of "annular" lipids and on average consisted of 18 lipid molecules. When compared with a "neat" bilayer without peptide, no significant difference was seen in the bilayer thickness, lipid conformations or diffusion, or headgroup orientation. However, the lipid hydrocarbon chain order parameters showed a significant decrease in order, especially in those methylene groups closest to the headgroup...|$|R
40|$|A {{possible}} {{cause of the}} large plasma flow velocities parallel to the magnetic field (which were observed in spacecraft experiments) near the boundary of the plasma sheet in the earth's magnetotail is considered {{in the framework of}} a magnetohydrodynamic model. It is shown for steady-state configurations that high parallel flow velocities can be expected to exist on field lines connecting to a region of weak magnetic field. The physical mechanism causing large values of the parallel velocity component can be visualized as a strong imbalance of perpendicular mass flux into and out of magnetic flux tubes passing through regions where the magnetic field is weak and inhomogeneous. The value of the parallel velocity component is evaluated, and it is found that it can <b>substantially</b> exceed the <b>perpendicular</b> velocity (by as much as a factor of 40).
