Equipped with state-of-the-art communications equipment and linked with Airbus engineering <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> <b>France</b> and Germany, the facility performs extensive work in disciplines such as fuselage structure, stress, system installation and design. In 2011, the centre employs some 200 engineers who have completed over 30 large-scale projects for the A320, the A330/A340 and the A380 programmes. Russian engineers also performed {{more than half of all}} design work on the A330-200F freighter, with its activity related to fuselage structure design, floor grids installation and junctions design. The centre currently is involved in the A320neo Sharklets design development and numerous design works for the A350 XWB programme.|$|E

2500|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the name}} Milan (Lombard: Milan [...] ) remains uncertain. One theory holds that the Latin name Mediolanum comes from the Latin words medio (in the middle) and planus (plain). However, some scholars believe that lanum comes from the Celtic root lan, [...] meaning an enclosure or demarcated territory (source of the Welsh word llan, meaning [...] "a sanctuary or church", ultimately cognate to English/German Land) in which Celtic communities used to build shrines. [...] Hence Mediolanum could signify the central town or sanctuary of a Celtic tribe. Indeed, about sixty Gallo-Roman <b>sites</b> <b>in</b> <b>France</b> bore the name [...] "Mediolanum", for example: Saintes (Mediolanum Santonum) and Évreux (Mediolanum Aulercorum). In addition, another theory links the name to the boar sow (the Scrofa semilanuta) an ancient emblem of the city, fancifully accounted for in Andrea Alciato's Emblemata (1584), beneath a woodcut of the first raising of the city walls, where a boar is seen lifted from the excavation, and the etymology of Mediolanum given as [...] "half-wool", explained in Latin and in French.|$|E
