5000|$|A matte {{display is}} an {{electronic}} display with a matte <b>surface.</b> <b>Matte</b> displays feature a light-scattering antireflection layer, which reduces reflectivity {{at the cost}} of decreased contrast and color intensity under dimly lit conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main purpose}} of matte glass is to {{transform}} the specular reflection into reflection haze. So-called [...] "scattering" [...] of the reflected light renders reflected images blurry, so that distinct reflected shapes and sources of light do not distract from the art viewing experience. Scattering the light does not reduce the reflection or absorption, which remain {{at the level of}} the glass substrate. There are several ways of making the glass <b>surface</b> <b>matte</b> - from pressing the pattern when the glass is still soft to fine etching of the glass surface by acid. The quality of matte glass is usually determined by its gloss factor or haze factor.|$|E

5000|$|... 'Gaffer tape' (or simply [...] "Gaff tape") is {{normally}} {{based on a}} heavy fabric or plastic tape. The name derives from its use by gaffers {{in the entertainment industry}} among others, to hold down cables particularly to prevent a tripping hazard and to prevent damage to cables and equipment. The adhesive leaves little or no residue, and the tape removes cleanly from cables, fabric, and many other <b>surfaces.</b> Its <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> also minimizes reflections from lights.|$|R

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{experimentally}} established, that etching of ZnSe:Te substrates in CrO 3 :HCl= 2 : 1 and H 2 SO 4 :H 2 O 2 = 3 : 1 solutions leads to formation of mirror and <b>matte</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Analysis of the topogram obtained by an atomic power microscope showed that <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> {{is a set}} of equally oriented pyramids with basis size 2 - 5 μm and each of them is association of nanopyramids with 10 - 100 nm lateral size. In such samples wide photoluminescence band at 2. 7 - 3. 8 eV is a result of dimensional quantization in smaller nanocrystals. The latter also causes an observed decrease of transmission coefficient of substrates with <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> in comparison to those with mirror surface owing to increase of light scattering processes...|$|R

50|$|Leatherdale's matte {{printing}} techniques, which adapt nineteenth-century {{processes and}} employ half black, half sepia colorations, reinforce the timelessness of his subjects. Tones and <b>matte</b> <b>surfaces</b> effectively differentiate his portraits from the easy slickness of fashion photography.|$|R
50|$|In painting, {{local color}} {{is the natural}} color of an object unmodified by adding light and shadow or any other distortion. Local color is best seen on a <b>matte</b> <b>surface,</b> due to it not being reflected, and {{therefore}} distorted.|$|R
5000|$|Then again, Lachenal’s trumpet neck vase wears a {{remarkable}} volcanic glaze whose pitted surface is astonishingly fresh, almost contemporary. Here the purposeful juxtaposition {{of an overall}} cratered <b>surface</b> and a <b>matte</b> glaze shoulder reveals keen sensitivity to textural effects.|$|R
50|$|Manual {{drawing on}} {{drafting}} film requires special care with cleanliness, because {{oil from the}} illustrator's hands can form skid patches on the film's nonporous surface, where ink and pencil will not adhere to the <b>matte</b> <b>surface,</b> while drafting paper will absorb the oil.|$|R
50|$|Cut: Media which cut {{can remove}} burrs and can smooth surfaces. As a carrier of {{abrasive}} grain, the large medium pieces effectively increase the impact {{force of the}} abrasive on the metal part to be cut, thereby improving {{the efficiency of the}} abrasive. Cutting media develop dull, <b>matte</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|In roads {{paved with}} setts (like belgian blocks or sampietrini) or cobblestones, {{markings}} {{can be made}} with white blocks or stones, like marble or other light-colored rocks. This kind of marking is long lasting, but could be slippery in rain or wet conditions unless <b>surfaced</b> with a <b>matte</b> or rough finish.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} on surface color perception has typically used Mondrian stimuli {{consisting of a}} small number of <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> patches in a plane perpendicular to the line of sight. In such scenes, reliable estimation of the color of a surface is a difficult if not impossible computational problem (Maloney, 1999). In three-dimensional scenes consisting of surfaces at many different orientations it is at least in theory possible to estimate surface color. However, the difficulty of the problem increases, in part, because the effective illumination incident on each surface (the light field) now depends on surface orientation and location. We review recent work in multiple laboratories that examines {{the degree to which the}} human visual system discounts the light field in judging <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> lightness and color and how the visual system estimates the flow of light in a scene...|$|R
40|$|Two {{new designs}} for {{microfilm}} viewers are described. Both viewers are front projection viewers utilizing <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> display screens. One viewer with an adjustable horizontal screen has a normal magnification rate and {{is mounted on}} a desk top. The other viewer has a high (4 x) magnification rate in a mini-theater configuration with remote microfiche positioning controls. The <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> screen {{is believed to be}} an improvement over conventional screens. Both viewers utilize conventional projection optics to maintain image contrast in controlled lighting environments. Interference between the user and the projected light is virtually eliminated by oblique projection achieved by simple, practical techniques. A survey of users shows a marked preference for the mini-theater viewer over conventional near projection viewers. Two control modes for positioning microfiche were developed for the mini-theater viewer: a velLcity-control system and a position-contro...|$|R

50|$|The Edge Series was {{released}} early in 2010 as {{small business and}} consumer-end machines. The design was a radical departure compared to the traditional black boxy ThinkPad design, with glossy <b>surfaces</b> (optional <b>matte</b> finish on later models), rounded corners, and silver trim. They were also offered in red, a first for the traditionally black ThinkPads. Like the SL, this series was targeted towards small businesses and consumers, and lack the roll cage, UltraBay, lid latch, and ThinkLight of traditional ThinkPads (though the 2011 E220s and E420s had ThinkLights). This also introduced an island-style keyboard with a significantly different layout.|$|R
50|$|Thermoforming: The {{thermoforming}} {{properties of}} Santoprene TPV {{are similar to}} acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and exhibit good melt strength, which provides uniform and predictable sag characteristics during heating. When producing sheet for thermoformed parts, key attributes of Santoprene TPV are maintained, including colorability, impact resistance, weatherability, chemical resistance, non-skid, <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> in appearance and feel.|$|R
5000|$|Both the {{keyboard}} and the touchpad received praise. The keyboard {{was described as}} having good tactile feedback with appropriate key travel. The touchpad was described as having a <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> which was {{easy to use and}} buttons with good tactile feedback. The multi-touch features were indicated by Notebook Review to [...] "work sporadically at best".|$|R
5000|$|With {{increased}} interest in the American Arts & Crafts Movement, a matte glaze was needed {{which could be used}} over under-glaze decoration (largely floral and scenic). Rookwood responded in 1904 with the introduction of the [...] "Vellum" [...] glaze, which presented a <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> but through which could be seen the slightly frosted-appearing decoration beneath.|$|R
5000|$|Lacquer: Staedtler {{produced}} and sold Fimo-branded glossy lacquer, {{it has now}} been discontinued. The lacquers are thick liquids applied after baking. They dry to a hard finish that protects the clay as well as changing the <b>surface</b> texture. A <b>matte</b> finish lacquer was available for some portion of the 1980s and 90s, but it has also been discontinued.|$|R
5|$|The DSi has a <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> to hide fingerprints. It is {{available}} in numerous colors, but color selection varies by region. For example, lime green is exclusive to Japan, while red {{is available}} in Europe and North America. North America also received a different shade of blue. Numerous special-edition models and bundles have been released, including those for , , and the 2009 Black Friday shopping day.|$|R
50|$|Ashton-Drake Galleries {{produced}} nearly exact {{replicas of}} the 5 original Kenner dolls in 2005-2006, along with replicas based on the original Kenner outfits. The first release had skin-tones with a slight green tint. A second release in 2007 was less green and more peach-pink. Both releases have a <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> texture. Ashton Drake in total released 12 different full-sized Blythe dolls, but ceased production in 2008.|$|R

50|$|The {{vigorous}} shrub {{has many}} slightly hooked prickles of different sizes, and grows to be 100 to 215 cm tall {{and up to}} 185 cm wide. The foliage consists of five oval-round leaflets with a <b>matte</b> <b>surface</b> and a bright mid- to dark green colour. Général Jacqueminot is winter hardy down to -26 °C (USDA zone 5), but rather susceptible to rust and mildew later in summer.|$|R
5|$|The DSi XL has a <b>matte</b> <b>surface,</b> and the {{exterior}} of its top panel is coated with a gloss finish. It is available in eight two-toned colors, varying by region such as white, green, red, yellow, and pink. Two special-edition models were released: those for LovePlus+ and the 25th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. Flipnote Studio and the Nintendo DSi Browser come pre-installed with the DSi XL, alongside other, region-specific software.|$|R
50|$|The dorsal <b>surfaces</b> are glabrous, <b>matte</b> or shiny black. The {{legs are}} powerful, with large tarsal claws. Males have {{appendages}} resembling horns on the pronotum {{and on the}} head. The two parallel horns on the pronotum are short, acute and forward pointing, while a much longer horn with a small tooth is present on the head. In the females the pronotum and the elytra are rugose and the horns are missing.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} matte finish and {{modularity}} on loosening of tapered stems {{using the same}} cementing technique were studied prospectively. In 80 patients, 82 cemented Exeter primary stems were implanted at total hip revision by one surgeon using the same surgical and cementing technique throughout the series. The polished stems behaved differently than the <b>matte</b> <b>surfaced</b> stems behaved. Polished stems subsided in the cement mantle an average of 1 mm at 2 years after implantation, but without subsequent loosening of stems at as long as 12 years after implantation. <b>Matte</b> <b>surfaced</b> stems with metal centralizers had a higher loosening rate, and loss of fixation at the prosthesis to cement interface was identified as an early sign of loosening of these stems. At a mean 6 -year followup, there were no revisions nor was there radiographic evidence of loosening of the polished modular stems. It is concluded that matte finish results in increased loosening of tapered stems but the introduction of modularity did not.
