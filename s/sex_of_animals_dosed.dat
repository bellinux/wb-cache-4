40|$|This study {{examined}} the ability of (i) pure nisin, (ii) nisin-producing Lactococcus lactis strain CHCC 5826, and (iii) the non-nisin-producing L. lactis strain CHCH 2862 to affect {{the composition of the}} intestinal microbiota of human flora-associated rats. The presence of both the nisin-producing and the non-nisin-producing L. lactis strains significantly increased the number of Bifidobacterium cells in fecal samples during the first 8 days but decreased the number of enterococci/streptococci in duodenum, ileum, cecum, and colon samples as detected by selective cultivation. No significant changes in the rat fecal microbiota were observed after dosage with nisin. Pearson cluster analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of the 16 S rRNA genes present in the fecal microbial population revealed that the microbiota <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>dosed</b> with either <b>of</b> the two L. lactis strains were different from that <b>of</b> control <b>animals</b> <b>dosed</b> with saline. However, profiles of the microbiota from <b>animals</b> <b>dosed</b> with nisin did not differ from the controls. The concentrations of nisin estimated by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were approximately 10 -fold higher in the small intestine and 200 -fold higher in feces than the corresponding concentrations estimated by a biological assay. This indicates that nisin was degraded or inactivated in the gastrointestinal tract, since fragments of this bacteriocin are detected by ELISA while an intact molecule is needed to retain biological activity...|$|R

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> a goatâ€™s <b>sex,</b> age, {{slaughter}} weight and nutrition on its skin and leather quality were investigated through chemical, biochemical, histological and hydrothermal analyses of dried skins, and physical testing of leathers. This work formed {{part of a}} larger project sponsored by the Natural Resources Institute, who provided the Brazilian goat skin raw materials. The basic chemical constituents (moisture, fat and nitrogen) of skins were influenced by both the age and <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> the <b>animal.</b> Their effect on the biochemical components (GAG and collagen contents) were less defined and probably a reflection of the early maturing nature of these components in the skin. Under different nutritional conditions only the fat content of skins varied significantly, being higher in skins <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> on a high plane of nutrition. The GAG contents of low nutritional skins were slightly higher than the corresponding high nutritional skins. A positive correlation between the {{slaughter weight}} <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> and GAG content of the skins was found. The weight, age, sex and nutritional conditions all influenced the thickness of the skin. The main influences were the slaughter weight (linked to age and nutrition) and the <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> the <b>animal.</b> The increase in thickness predominantly occurred in the corium layer of the skin. Differences in corium fibre structure, in particular the compactness and angle of weave, were related to skin thickness. Physical properties of the leathers were directly related to the thickness of the skin (and weight), grain to corium ratios and corium collagen structure. The leathers became stronger and gave lower distentions with increasing age and nutritional stress. The physical properties of the leathers were also linked to the <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> the <b>animal.</b> The strongest leathers were obtained from male <b>animals.</b> Softness <b>of</b> leathers was infuenced by the <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> the <b>animal</b> and slaughter weight...|$|R

Following the 2015 NIH policy for consideration <b>of</b> <b>sex</b> as a biological variable in preclinical research, in 2018, authors of papers published in primary-research American Society for Microbiology (ASM) journals {{will be asked to}} report the <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> the research subjects and <b>animals</b> and <b>of</b> materials derived directly from them. To address the need for sex reporting in ASM journals, we systematically reviewed 2, 928 primary-research articles published in six primary-research ASM journals (Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Clinical and Vaccine Immunology, Infection and Immunity, Journal of Bacteriology, Journal of Virology, and mBio) in 2016. Approximately 37 % <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> studies and 9 % of primary cell culture papers published in 2016 would have been affected by the new sex-reporting policy.

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the contamination by mercury (Hg), methylmercury (Me-Hg), cadmium (Cd), selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) in dolphins stranded on the French Mediterranean coast. The distributions of these contaminants in the organs of dolphins have also been studied. Overall, contamination levels varied according to the following sequence: liver> kidney> lung> muscle, except for cadmium (kidney> liver> lung> muscle). Size and <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> were also considered. Young dolphins were less impacted with trace elements than adults, except for copper. Among the studied parameters, the most important appeared to be the size of mammals. In addition, in the case of mercury and selenium, the <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> mammals seemed to be also relevant. The correlations between the concentrations of trace elements suggest the existence of detoxification processes. Since 1990 s, using dolphins for tracing marine pollution, a slight reduction in the burden of the considered trace elements could be noted...|$|R

40|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{metabolism}} of Artemia have been investigated. Experiments have been made with <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> different stocks, obtained from different localities. The growth of Artemia is influenced {{not only by the}} <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> the <b>animal,</b> but also by the stock from which it is derived. Likewise, the effect of the salinity of the medium on growth varies with sex and stock. The growth of Artemia is retarded in brine with a low dissolved oxygen content. Changes in body proportions occur with increase in size of Artemia: in particular, the abdomen becomes relatively longer. Body form is also influenced by the salinity of the external medium. The extent to which this occurs varies with the <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> the <b>animal</b> and the stock from which it is derived. The oxygen consumption of Artemia has been measured in relation to the size and <b>sex</b> <b>of</b> the <b>animal</b> and also to the salinity of the medium and its dissolved oxygen content. Females have the same rate of oxygen uptake in sea water as in more concentrated brine. Malesin sea water have a higher rate of oxygen uptake than in concentratedbrine. This difference has been related to the greater area of the second antennae of males in sea water. The colours of Artemia are due mainly to haem compounds andcarotenoids. Haemoglobin occurs in solution in the blood; the role of this pigment in the life of Artemia has been investigated. The colours of the eggs are due to differences in total haem content of the egg shell. The red colour of the nauplius and of certain adults is due to carotenoids; some of these have been identified. <p...|$|R
