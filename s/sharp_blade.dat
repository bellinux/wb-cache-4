5|$|The paper {{used for}} the Grolier Codex appears to be {{authentic}} pre-Columbian bark paper dating from the 13th century. A number of non-destructive techniques have been applied to the codex {{in an effort to}} authenticate it, and the results were published in 2008. The analysis revealed that only pre-Columbian materials had been used in its creation; no modern inorganic materials were detected. Some inconsistencies were revealed however; cuts along the page edges seem to have been made with a <b>sharp</b> <b>blade</b> in order to give the appearance of natural wear and tear and the supposed water staining did not permeate the paper. The researchers commented that the staining appeared {{to be the result of}} drops of dye or ink being applied to the surface of the codex. In conclusion the researchers were unable to support or refute the pre-Columbian nature of the codex. Unusually for a document that supposedly was stored in a cave for centuries, the paint of the codex still appears fresh.|$|E

25|$|The Native Americans {{used two}} kinds of knife traps. One method was to encase a <b>sharp</b> <b>blade</b> in fat and frozen upright on a block of ice. The wolf would cut itself while licking the blade and bleed to death. Some argue that this method is a myth. The other method was a baited torsion spring which when triggered, would stab the wolf in the head.|$|E

25|$|The presses {{first used}} {{were of the}} {{ordinary}} letterpress type, the engraved plate being fixed {{in the place of}} the type. In later improvements the well-known cylinder press was employed; the plate was inked mechanically and cleaned off by passing under a <b>sharp</b> <b>blade</b> of steel; and the cloth, instead of being laid on the plate, was passed round the pressure cylinder. The plate was raised into frictional contact with the cylinder and in passing under it transferred its ink to the cloth.|$|E
25|$|A {{further and}} most {{important}} appliance is the doctor, a thin <b>sharp</b> <b>blade</b> of steel that rests on the engraved roller and serves to scrape off every vestige of superfluous colour from its surface, leaving only that which rests in the engraving. On the perfect action of this doctor depends the entire success of printing, and as its sharpness and angle of inclination to the copper roller varies with the styles of work in hand it requires an expert to get it up (sharpen it) properly and considerable practical experience {{to know exactly what}} qualities it should possess in any given case. In order to prevent it from wearing irregularly it is given a to-and-fro motion so that it is constantly changing its position and is never in contact with one part of the engraving for more than of brass or a similar alloy is frequently added {{on the opposite side of}} the roller to that occupied by the steel or cleaning doctor; it is known technically as the lint doctor from its purpose of cleaning off loose filaments or lint, which the roller picks off the cloth during the printing operation. The steel or cleaning doctor is pressed against the roller by means of weighted levers, but the lint doctor is usually just allowed to rest upon it by its own weight as its function is merely to intercept the nap which becomes detached from the cloth and would, if not cleaned from the roller, mix with the colour and give rise to defective work.|$|E

2500|$|Bilirubin is {{degraded}} by light. Blood collection tubes containing {{blood or}} (especially) serum {{to be used}} in bilirubin assays should be protected from illumination. For adults, blood is typically collected by needle from a vein in the arm. In newborns, blood is often collected from a heel stick, a technique that uses a small, <b>sharp</b> <b>blade</b> to cut the skin on the infant's heel and collect a few drops of blood into a small tube. Non-invasive technology is available in some health care facilities that will measure bilirubin by using an instrument placed on the skin (transcutaneous bilirubin meter) ...|$|E
2500|$|A bandsaw (also written band saw) is a {{saw with}} a long, <b>sharp</b> <b>blade</b> {{consisting}} of a continuous band of toothed metal stretched between two or more wheels to cut material. They are used principally in woodworking, metalworking, and lumbering, but may cut a variety of materials. Advantages include uniform cutting action {{as a result of}} an evenly distributed tooth load, and the ability to cut irregular or curved shapes like a jigsaw. The minimum radius of a curve is determined by the width of the band and its kerf. [...] Most bandsaws have two wheels rotating in the same plane, one of which is powered, although some may have three or four to distribute the load. The blade itself can come in a variety of sizes and tooth pitches (teeth per inch, or TPI), which enables the machine to be highly versatile and able to cut a wide variety of materials including wood, metal and plastic.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} one handed devices was the {{automatic}} spring release, {{also known as a}} switchblade. An innovation to pocket knives made possible by the thumb-stud is the replaceable blade insert developed in 1999 by Steven Overholt (U.S. Patent no. 6,574,868), originally marketed by TigerSharp Technologies and as of 2007 by Clauss. Some systems are somewhat between assisted opening and the normal thumb stud. CRKT knives designed by Harold [...] "Kit" [...] Carson often incorporate a [...] "Carson Flipper", which is a small protrusion on the rear of the base of the blade such that it protrudes out the obverse side of the handle (when closed). By using an index finger and a very slight snapping of the wrist, the knife opens very quickly, appearing to operate like a spring assisted knife. When opened, the protrusion is between the base of the <b>sharp</b> <b>blade</b> and the user's index finger, preventing any accidental slipping of the hand onto the blade. Some designs feature a second [...] "Flipper" [...] {{on the opposite side of}} the blade, forming a small [...] "hilt guard" [...] such as a fixed blade knife has, which can prevent another blade from sliding up into the hilt in combat.|$|E

"Biting" [...] {{sharpness}} {{is considered}} ideal for kitchen knives, but <b>sharper</b> <b>blades</b> are desired for shaving and surgical scalpels, which must cut without side-to-side slicing of the blade, and duller but tougher blades are {{more suitable for}} chiseling and chopping wood.|$|R

2500|$|When {{grown for}} opium production, {{the skin of}} the {{ripening}} pods of these poppies is scored by a <b>sharp</b> <b>blade</b> at a time carefully chosen so that rain, wind, and dew cannot spoil the exudation of white, milky latex, usually in the afternoon. Incisions are made while the pods are still raw, with no more than a slight yellow tint, and must be shallow to avoid penetrating hollow inner chambers or loculi while cutting into the lactiferous vessels. In Indian Subcontinent, Afghanistan, Central Asia and Iran, the special tool used to make the incisions is called a nushtar or [...] "nishtar" [...] (from Persian, meaning a lancet) and carries three or four blades three millimeters apart, which are scored upward along the pod. Incisions are made three or four times at intervals of two to three days, and each time the [...] "poppy tears", which dry to a sticky brown resin, are collected the following morning. One acre harvested in this way can produce three to five kilograms of raw opium. In the Soviet Union, pods were typically scored horizontally, and opium was collected three times, or else one or two collections were followed by isolation of opiates from the ripe capsules. Oil poppies, an alternative strain of P. somniferum, were also used for production of opiates from their capsules and stems. A traditional Chinese method of harvesting opium latex involved cutting off the heads and piercing them with a coarse needle then collecting the dried opium 24 to 48 hours later.|$|E

60|$|But {{just then}} {{he glanced at}} the ground and saw why the boy did not care to tumble down. For in the earth were planted many swords, with their <b>sharp</b> <b>blades</b> {{pointing}} upward, and to fall upon these meant serious wounds and perhaps death.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the first}} half of the 19th century and some of the 18th century, {{students}} believed the character of a person could easily be judged by watching him fight with <b>sharp</b> <b>blades</b> under strict regulations. Academic fencing was more and more seen as a kind of personality training by showing countenance and fairness even in dangerous situations. Student corporations demanded their members fight at least one duel with <b>sharp</b> <b>blades</b> during their university time. The problem was that some peaceful students had nobody to offend them. The solution was a kind of formal insult that did not actually infringe honour, but was just seen as a challenge for fencing. The standard wording was dummer Junge (German for [...] "young fool.") ...|$|R
