60|$|Without {{waiting to}} be answered, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, and left us.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coffin. Suddenly {{she lost}} every vestige of self-control. She sank {{down on her}} knees beside the trestle. [...] "Why have you left me!" [...] she cried.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I in time?" [...] {{were the}} first words that escaped her on {{entering}} the room. Reassured by the answer, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, eager to hurry upstairs to Kitty's bedside.|$|E
60|$|He {{answered}} vaguely. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Hunterleys. <b>She</b> {{was busy}} tearing up her handkerchief.|$|R
60|$|A suggestive gleam {{crept into}} Winifred's eyes, but it {{vanished}} and her manner became authoritative when <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Sproatly.|$|R
60|$|Whereupon <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her arranging, fixing, stitching, {{his nerves}} jumped with anger as the sewing-machine started and stuttered and buzzed.|$|R
60|$|In {{the step}} of the {{slightly}} stolid girl {{there was a new}} lightness, a new ecstasy in walking rapidly through the stirring New York air, as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sessionses' flat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, my dear, when once I'm sure of YOU!" [...] Rosier murmured in her ear; whereupon <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{other rooms}} {{with a little}} air of {{consistency}} which seemed to imply that their appeal should be immediate.|$|E
6000|$|She {{snatched}} up the volume {{and looked at the}} open page. It contained the closing paragraphs of an eloquent attack on Protestantism, from the Roman Catholic point of view. With trembling hands <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> title-page. It presented this written inscription: [...] "To Lewis Romayne from his attached friend and servant, Arthur Penrose." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{painting}} by Mola Ram: Abhisarika nayika, [...] "the heroine {{going to meet}} her lover". <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> look at a golden anklet, which has just fallen off. There are also snakes below and lightning above.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Cowles shivered. No {{one could}} {{possibly}} have {{looked more like a}} person closing a door without actually closing one. [...] "Lena!" [...] she shrieked, [...] "close the kitchen door. There's a draught." [...] <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Carl.|$|R
60|$|She {{said nothing}} for a moment. But the tears {{gathered}} in her eyes, her lips quivered and Maurice {{knew that she was}} thanking God. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him and he could see her face glowing with excitement.|$|R
60|$|In Beldover, {{there was}} both for Ursula and for Gudrun an interval. It seemed to Ursula as if Birkin {{had gone out}} of her for the time, he had lost his significance, he {{scarcely}} mattered in her world. She had her own friends, her own activities, her own life. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old ways with zest, away from him.|$|E
60|$|She crept back at last towards Ugh-lomi {{and heard}} him {{stirring}} and moaning. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mound again; {{then she saw}} something in the darkness near the stake, and peering distinguished a jackal. In a flash she was brave and angry; she sprang up, cried out, and ran towards the offering. She stumbled and fell, and heard the growling of the jackal going off.|$|E
60|$|So <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town. She {{would not}} be able to take the twelve-forty train, for it was already mid-day. But she was glad. She wanted some time to herself. She would send Ciccio on. Slowly she climbed the {{familiar}} hill--slowly--and rather bitterly. She felt her native place insulted her: and she felt the Natchas insulted her. In the midst of the insult she remained isolated upon herself, and she wished to be alone.|$|E
50|$|She had {{two other}} marriages, to Lee Stricker and Timothy Stricker {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s. When her husband Timothy went to prison in 1995 <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her art and {{made a name for}} herself in Charleston, Illinois.|$|R
60|$|The car {{had stopped}} outside the theatre. Hat in hand, {{and with his}} face wreathed in smiles, the commissionaire had thrown open the door. The people on the {{pavement}} were nudging one another--a famous woman was about <b>to</b> descend. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Philip.|$|R
60|$|Miss Rachel was {{the next}} to say good-night. She shook hands first with Mr. Godfrey, who was {{standing}} {{at the other end of}} the hall, looking at a picture. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Franklin, still sitting weary and silent in a corner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] Madame Merle exclaimed, [...] "that I've never seen! But {{my dreams}} were so great--so preposterous. Heaven forgive me, I'm dreaming now!" [...] And <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> piano and began grandly to play. On the morrow {{she said to}} Isabel that her {{definition}} of success had been very pretty, yet frightfully sad. Measured in that way, who had ever succeeded? The dreams of one's youth, why they were enchanting, they were divine! Who had ever seen such things come to pass? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cottage astounded, angry, and vaguely alarmed. Who {{was this}} Mrs. Fairfax who had usurped her fame and solitary devotion? There was no {{woman in the}} boat that took him off; it was equally well known that he went in the ship alone. If they had heard that some woman was with him here--why should they have {{supposed}} it was Mrs. Fairfax? Zephas might know something--but he was away. The thought haunted her that day and the next. On the third came a more startling incident.|$|E
60|$|As <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house, the {{struggle}} of the past night renewed itself in her mind. But the sense of relief which the child had brought to her, the reviving tenderness which she had felt while he sat on her knee, influenced her still. She was conscious of a dawning hope, opening freshly on her thoughts, as the boy's innocent eyes had opened on her face {{when he came to}} her on the beach. Was it too late to turn back? Once more she asked herself that question, and now, for the first time, she asked it in doubt.|$|E
60|$|As {{she moved}} forward, she was {{suddenly}} conscious {{of the man who}} had been talking to Madame Selarne. He had drawn a little on one side and he was watching the young soldier with a curious intentness. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her nephew and touched him on the arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it's mine; my own." [...] And, <b>turning</b> round, <b>she</b> {{slipped the}} little ring off her finger. When <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him, {{his face had}} not {{recovered}} from her words. It had a hapless look, as of one to whom such a thing ought not to have happened.|$|R
6000|$|... said old Mrs. Possum, {{grinning}} in {{the most}} aggravating way as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her babies. <b>She</b> had found out {{what she wanted to}} know--Sammy Jay had seen nothing of Unc' Billy Possum. Old Mrs. Possum sat down with her head in her hands. She was more worried than ever.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house, a smile {{upon her}} face. Nigel {{had sent her}} greeting. A Frenchman had brought it. His {{bringing}} it had made him a freeman. And Saint Catherine had been Nigel's friend. It was at her shrine that he had sworn that three deeds should be done ere he should set eyes upon her again. In the privacy of her room the Lady Mary sank upon her prie-dieu and poured forth the thanks of her heart to the Virgin that one deed was accomplished; but even {{as she did so}} her joy was overcast by the thought of those two others which lay before him.|$|E
6000|$|Straight {{toward his}} mother raced Gazan, and after him came Tarzan. Teeka {{looked up from}} her feeding, and in the first instant that she {{realized}} that Gazan was fleeing and that another was in pursuit, she bared her fangs and bristled; but when she saw that the pursuer was Tarzan <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> business that had been occupying her attention. At her very feet the ape-man overhauled the balu and, though the youngster squealed and fought when Tarzan seized him, Teeka only glanced casually in their direction. No longer did she fear harm to her first-born {{at the hands of the}} ape-man. Had he not saved Gazan on two occasions? ...|$|E
6000|$|The house clock {{struck the}} hour, and roused her. She sighed, and, {{walking back to}} the glass, wearily {{loosened}} the fastenings of her dress; wearily removed the studs from the chemisette beneath it, {{and put them on the}} chimney-piece. She looked indolently at the reflected beauties of her neck and bosom, as she unplaited her hair and threw it back in one great mass over her shoulders. [...] "Fancy," [...] she thought, [...] "if he saw me now!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table, and sighed again as she extinguished one of the candles and took the other in her hand. [...] "Midwinter?" [...] she said, as she passed through the folding-doors of the room to her bed-chamber. [...] "I don't believe in his name, to begin with!" ...|$|E
6000|$|An old {{man with}} weak eyes and a loose-hung mouth shuffled forward. To him the girl explained: [...] "This is Mrs. Ollnee's son. He says his mother is dead. I'm going up there. You look out for the baby." [...] <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Victor. [...] "When did she die?" ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{the lodge}} was reached, and Mervyn, {{somewhat}} revived, had ridden through the gates, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> give her warm thanks. A kind, fatherly, friendly face {{looked at her}} with a sort of compassion, as putting aside her thanks, the gentleman said, quickly, yet half-reluctantly, 'Have you ever seen him like this before?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him {{and stood}} looking at the fire again.|$|R
60|$|He {{disappeared}} {{through the}} French windows. Lady Ashleigh was studying the letter stretched out before her, her brows a little knitted, her expression distressed. Ella had turned {{and was looking}} out westwards across the park, towards the sea. For a moment she dreamed of all the wonderful things that lay {{on the other side}} of that silver streak. She saw inside the crowded Opera House. She felt the tense hush, the thrill of excitement. She heard the low sobbing of the violins, she saw the stage-setting, she heard the low notes of music creeping and growing till every pulse in her body thrilled with her one great enthusiasm. When <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table, her eyes were bright and there was a little flush upon her cheeks.|$|E
60|$|More {{concerned}} {{than she}} cared to confess, vaguely fearful {{that she was}} in some way connected with his abrupt withdrawal, and perhaps a little remorseful that she had allowed her personal feelings to interfere with her frank recognition of his triumph, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> schoolroom, after the little performers and their audience had departed, in the hope that he might return. It was getting late, the nearly level rays of the sun were lying on the empty benches {{at the lower end of}} the room, but the desk where she sat with its lid raised was in deep shadow. Suddenly she heard his voice in a rear hall, but it was accompanied by another's,--the same voice which had interrupted the applause. Before she could either withdraw, or make herself known, the two men had entered the room, and were passing slowly through it. She understood at once that Twing had slipped out into a janitor's room in the rear, where he had evidently forced an interview and explanation from his interrupter, and now had been waiting for the audience to disperse before emerging by the front door. They had evidently overlooked her in the shadow.|$|E
50|$|As <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window, a soldier, at a {{distance}} of about eight yards, shot a rubber bullet through the window hitting her in the face. As a result, she lost her sight in both eyes. A doctor at the hospital who was removing Emma's eyes approached Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who was visiting Belfast at the time, to break the news to Emma that her eyesight was gone. Years later, she was offered £35,000 compensation, which was seen at the time as a de facto admission by the Army, although the soldier involved was never charged.|$|E
50|$|<b>She</b> then <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{virology}} {{and joined}} the effort to develop an HIV vaccine.|$|R
5000|$|In {{one of the}} back-up issues, June Moone {{was called}} upon by Amanda Waller to help a {{military}} general whose house had been possessed by a demon. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> into the Enchantress but the Enchantress ends up scheming with the demon to escape Amanda Waller and destroy the world. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> June to have the demon remove the bomb device and set the Enchantress free. However, the demon attacks her and frightens her. June, in retaliation, unleashes magic and banishes the demon, without turning into the Enchantress.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} later in her career that Inglis began drawing in colour and {{illustrating}} different flowers, fruits, or small animals that often appeared in the borders of Flemish manuscripts. Even later in her career, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> developing recreated printed books, including reproducing fifty-one of the Emblemes ou devises chrestiennes by Georgette de Montenay for Prince Charles.|$|R
