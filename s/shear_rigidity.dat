50|$|Inverse {{modeling}} is {{a mathematical}} technique where {{the objective is}} to determine the physical properties of the subsurface of an earth region that has produced a given seismogram. Cooke and Schneider (1983) defined it as calculation of the earth’s structure and physical parameters from some set of observed seismic data. The underlying assumption in this method is that the collected seismic data are from an earth structure that matches the cross-section computed from the inversion algorithm. Some common earth properties that are inverted for include acoustic velocity, formation and fluid densities, acoustic impedance, Poisson's ratio, formation compressibility, <b>shear</b> <b>rigidity,</b> porosity, and fluid saturation.|$|E

In the framework of extended kinetic theory, i. e., kinetic theory that accounts for the decreasing in the collisional dissipation due to the breaking of molecular chaos at volume fractions larger than 0. 49, we also show that the volume fraction-dependence of the correlation length (measure of the velocity correlation) is singular at random close packing, independent of the interparticle friction. The difference in the singularities ensures that the ratio of the shear stress to the pressure at <b>shear</b> <b>rigidity</b> is different from zero even in the case of frictionless spheres: we identify that with the yield stress ratio of granular materials, and we show that the theoretical predictions, once the different singularities are inserted into the functions of extended kinetic theory, are in excellent agreement with the results of numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|Diagonal grids {{are one of}} the {{commonly}} used structural forms. Roof and floor system bridge ship decks, elevated highway and raft foundations are examples of structures for which diagonal grids may provide suitable solutions. Diagonal grids belong to a family of flat grids and their structural behaviour, like that of all flat grids, is mainly governed by bending. The members of a diagonal grid, therefore, essentially work in bending and their flexural rigidity is the main load resisting agent. Another two types of rigidities affecting the behaviour of flat grids are toroional and <b>shearing</b> <b>rigidities.</b> The nature of the effects of those rigidities, however, have not, in the past, been clearly understood and their importance has boon usually underestimated. This thesis presents an attempt to study the effects of these rigidities on the magnitudes and distribution of internal forces and displacements in diagonal grids. The material of the thesis is arranged in the following manner: The preliminary definitions and relations and the background to the subject are given in chapter one. Chapter two contains a description of the work involved in the analysis and the results of the analysis {{of a large number of}} diagonal grids. The conclusions obtained from these analytical, results are given in chapter five. An account of the experimental investigations is given in chapter four. In chapter three, the concept of vector and matrix norms is employed to develop an original technique which is used to estimate the changes in the internal forces and displacements of flat grids due to variations in the torsional or <b>shearing</b> <b>rigidities.</b> Furthermore. it is shown that the scope of this technique is not confined to the matter under consideration and the idea may be applied to many other problems of structural analysis. In particular, subject to the conditions described in the text, the technique will provide a new and powerful means for structural optimization processes and it may even find uses in disciplines other than structural analysis...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{illustrates}} results {{concerned with}} experimental tests on physical (reduced-scale) models of pentamode lattices confined between rigid plates and equipped with rigid connections. Finally, it discusses the potential {{use of such}} systems for the base isolation of existing buildings. Through experimental arguments, we show that the mechanical response of pentamode lattices with rigid connections is bending-dominated, and that such structures are able to carry unidirectional compressive loads with sufficiently high stiffness, while showing markedly low stiffness against shear loads. The high ratio between effective compression and <b>shear</b> <b>rigidities</b> derives both from the nonzero bending rigidity of nodes and rods, and from the confinement effect played by the stiffening plates. The obtained results emphasize the ability of such structures to behave as tension-capable and performance-based systems, whose mechanical properties are driven more by the geometry of the lattice microstructure (i. e., such systems behave as mechanical metamaterials) than the chemical composition of the material they are made of...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of the soil-structure interface {{is crucial}} to the design of a pile foundation. Radial unloading occurs during the process of hole boring and concrete curing, which will affect the load transfer rule of the pile-soil interface. Through large shear tests on the interface between clay and concrete, it can be concluded that the normal stress history significantly influences the shear behaviour of the interface. The numerical simulation of the bored shaft-soil interaction problem requires proper modelling of the interface. By taking the energy accumulated on the interface as a hardening parameter and viewing the shearing process of the interface as the process of the energy dissipated to do work, considering the influence of the normal stress history on the <b>shearing</b> <b>rigidity,</b> a mechanical model of the interface between clay and concrete is proposed. The methods to define the model parameters are also introduced. The model is based on a legible mathematical theory, and all its parameters have definite physical meaning. The model was validated using data from a direct shear test; the validation results indicated that the model can reproduce and predict the mechanical behaviour of the interface between clay and concrete under an arbitrary stress history...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe materials, {{structure}} and strength parameters {{of all the}} components of the scaffolds are regulated by safety standards {{to ensure the safety of}} construction site workers. Whenever a new scaffold member is developed, its design must follow the standard. Therefore, all scaffolds have the same structure. This study is fundamental to the establishment of a new method to evaluate a scaffold's performance in the buckling strength. Thus the buckling of scaffolds is often caused by the excessive weight of vertical loads. In the buckling modes, there is member buckling, as each story of the scaffolds curves, and total buckling, as the whole side of the scaffold caves in. Recent studies confirm that total buckling is often caused when a stiffening member in the vertical frame is shorting. It is known that <b>shear</b> <b>rigidity</b> of the horizontal frame can also influence buckling modes. However, the influence of <b>shear</b> <b>rigidity</b> of both vertical and horizontal frames on the scaffold's buckling modes has not been made clear. We therefore performed a numerical analysis to investigate this, using the <b>shear</b> <b>rigidity</b> of the vertical and the horizontal frames as parameters.

40|$|International audienceWhile {{vertical}} motion induced by long-term geological loads {{is often used}} to estimate the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere, we intend to evaluate the <b>shear</b> <b>rigidity</b> of the lithosphere using horizontal motion. Our approach considers that the rigidity of the lithosphere may be defined as its resistance to horizontal tectonic lateral forces. In this case, a spatial distribution of an effective <b>shear</b> <b>rigidity</b> can be estimated from the analysis of the interseismic velocity fields. We consider the Western United States zone where weakly strained areas (e. g., the Sierra Nevada) are connected with areas of large strain rate (e. g. San Andreas Fault system). By inverting interseismic strain distribution measured by geodetic methods, we infer the effective <b>shear</b> <b>rigidity</b> of the lithosphere. The forward problem is defined using the equations of linear elasticity. The inversion relies on the minimization of the sum of a quadratic measure of the differences between measured and modelled velocity fields. The functional also includes regularization terms for the parameters of the model. The gradient of the functional with respect to the minimization parameters is computed using an adjoint formulation. This permits the treatment of large dimensional minimization problems. Finally, a measure of the uncertainty of our inversion is illustrated through the covariance matrix of the parameters at the optimum. The optimization chart is validated on two synthetic velocity distributions. Then, the effective <b>shear</b> <b>rigidity</b> variations of the Western United States are estimated using the CMM 3 interseismic velocities. The inversion displays low effective rigidities along the San Andreas Fault system, the Mojave Desert and in the Eastern California Shear Zone, while rigid areas are found in the Sierra Nevada and in the South Basin and Range. Finally, we discuss the differences between our strain rate and rigidity maps with previously published results for the Western United States...|$|E

40|$|We {{focus on}} the {{modelling}} of the linear elastic flexure of composite beams in which the external layers are connected by a midlayer allowing a conspicuous slip between the external layers. In particular, we {{consider the case of}} concrete-timber systems in which the midlayer consists of steel shear connectors passing through a wooden plank. To model these structures, we extend the Newmark theory, originally developed for connection of negligible thickness. Also, we apply Jourawski's technique to the Newmark model to obtain accurate analytic predictions of the shear stress. We provide analytic solutions for the cases of simply-supported, cantilever, and propped-cantilever beams, all subject to uniform load, and we compare the results with those obtained from both accurate plane stress Finite Element simulations and the First-Order Shear Deformation (FOSD) theory. For the latter we provide the explicit expression of the <b>shearing</b> <b>rigidity</b> based on a classical energy criterion. We show the inability of the FOSD modelling to accurately predict the deflection and explain the unexpected too large compliance characterising the FOSD estimate. Instead, the Newmark model turns out to be highly accurate for sufficiently slender beams, even in terms of shear stress if the "Jourawski-like" post-processing proposed here is used. We also consider a further extension of Newmark's theory to accurately model not-too-slender composite beams. In such an extension, henceforth called the Newmark-Timoshenko model, the wooden element is allowed to follow a Timoshenko kinematics, richer than the Euler-Bernoulli kinematics assigned to both the external layers in the Newmark model. The results of the novel Newmark-Timoshenko model are numerically obtained by the Rayleigh-Ritz method in which the analytic solution of Newmark's model is used to construct optimal approximating functions of the field entering the Total Potential Energy functional...|$|R

In addition, in an asymmetrical truss configuration, coupling between the extensional and shear modes raises the maximum peak displacement compared with that obtained for a symmetrical truss. The model is modified to investigate the introduction of passive damping in the form of several dynamic vibration absorbers. A unique absorber parameter optimization procedure, based on the classical steady-state criteria, is used to tune the absorbers, having a total allocated mass budget of 10 %, to the first two frequencies of the latticed structure.

In the design of corrugated boxes, the stacking strength is an important design parameter. Current research shows that box failure is inﬂuenced by the ﬂexural rigidities of the panel and its transverse <b>shear</b> <b>rigidities.</b> McKinlay proposed a new method to measure the MD transverse shear stiffness of corrugated board. This research was aimed at designing a ﬁxture to perform the MD shear test and to evaluate its performance. In addition, the properties that inﬂuence box strength were to be investigated.

It was found that the designed MD shear ﬁxture was able to measure the transverse shear stiffness of corrugated board in the MD direction {{with a high degree of}} accuracy and reproducibility. This method was much easier to perform than the standard block shear test method and also much quicker. This was a very important factor considering the application of this testing method in a research and development environment. In addition, the stiffness test exhibited good possibilities for use as a quality control tool. Extensive testing showed that the material used in the manufacture of corrugated board had a strong inﬂuence on board and box strength. In addition, it was found that the separation of the faces in a corrugated board structure had an inﬂuence on the strength and stability of the box.
