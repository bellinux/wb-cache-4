40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the hypothetical {{benefits of the}} IV 2 TM flow medical device. BACKGROUND: Intravenous fluid administration is a standard hospital procedure with assumed inadequacies. The IV-Event Study [Fraser N, Nel G, Snyman J & Wessels F (2004) IV-EVENT Study: Intravenous Infusion Therapy – Management and Adverse Events. Data on File: Varori International (Pty) Ltd., Centurion, South Africa] quantified these inadequacies; The ‘Stargait’ intervention trial investigated the effectiveness and possible cost-benefit of the IV 2 TM flow. The IV 2 TM flow is intended for routine use with gravitational intravenous infusion sets. The IV 2 TM flow should reduce the incidence rate of adverse events and maintain a <b>set</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> METHOD: Nursing staff assisted by study assessors captured relevant data. Consented patients were enrolled {{for the period of}} their prescribed infusions. INTERVENTION: The Stargait Trial compared the treatment group (standard gravitational sets with the IV 2 TM flow) with the control group (standard gravitational infusion sets without IV 2 TM flow). The difference in observed events and the cost benefit derived from this were measured. RESULTS: A total of 2387 drip hours were observed in 52 patients. The adverse event rates were: Control group (without IV 2 TM flow) 33. 8 %. The treatment group (IV 2 TM flow) 15. 4 %. This 55 % reduction is statistically significant (p = 0. 0069). Adverse event related monetary wastage (labour and consumables) is reduced by 76 % for infusion bags in the intervention group (with IV 2 TM flow). There was {{a significant difference between the}} treatment group and control group as far as deviation in flow rate was concerned (p = 0. 00818). The mean deviation of the IV 2 TM flow group was just more than 5 ml per hour. The standard line group had a mean deviation of more than 30 ml per hour. CONCLUSION: Gravitational intravenous therapy compromises quality of patient care. The Stargait Trial has proven the care-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the IV 2 TM flow...|$|E

Studies have examined the performance of filtering facepiece respirators against engineered nanoparticles. This {{has been done by}} the generation and dispersal of certain particles in a given size distribution, which have then been run through experimental set-ups involving Condensation Particle Counters, Scanning Mobility Particle Sizers, and high efficiency performance filters for a set flow. Published {{studies have shown that the}} respirators used do provide expected levels of filtration protection against nanometer-sized particles. However, studies have not examined or applied different types of nanoparticle samples - different particle types have differing morphologies and physical characteristics that could affect filter performance. This study has exposed NIOSH-approved N 95 facepiece respirators to six different types of engineered nanoparticles: aluminum oxide, iron oxide, single-walled carbon nanotubes, synthesized diamond, silicon dioxide, and titanium dioxide. In addition, N 95 respirators have not been commonly exposed to differing concentrations of an aerosol in order to observe a shift in the primary penetrating particle size and a shift in the overall size distribution. This study challenged N 95 respirators to four different concentrations of sodium chloride: 0. 1, 1, 10, and 50 mg/ml. Another concern is whether or not a prolonged exposure of a single respirator affects the overall performance and protection from an aerosol, especially engineered nanoparticles, since very few studies have been done regarding this matter. N 95 respirators were exposed to several types of engineered nanoparticles in a respirator testing apparatus at a <b>set</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> examined for penetration with an SMPS, CPC, and DMA given these conditions: differing concentrations of sodium chloride, different engineered particles, and an extended duration of exposure to both sodium chloride and 15 -nm titanium dioxide. This study showed that the primary penetrating particle size through an N 95 facepiece respirator does increase and shift with increasing concentrations of an aerosol; however, the overall size distribution did not seem to shift much. Penetration decreased as sodium chloride concentration increased. Different nanoparticles had differing primary penetrating particle sizes through the respirator; however, penetration of these particles was similar to one another with the exception of iron oxide which had quite a high penetration percentage. A decrease in N 95 respirator performance was observed when exposed to a 1 mg/ml solution of sodium chloride, as penetration increased with prolonged exposure. However, this did not seem to be the case when the respirator was exposed to a 6. 67 mg/ml suspension of 15 -nm titanium dioxide, as the penetration over the extended period of time was similar to one another...|$|E

Com-pared to oxygen cylinders and the oxygen concentrator, the liquid oxygen system has several advantages such as its convenience for home use and the light weight and high capacity of the portable canister [1 – 3]. A benefit reg-ularly mentioned by oxygen companies is the reliability of the system.

When it is important, however, cooling in the flow considerably increases the infall rate over the adiabatic maximum value for the same set of boundary conditions. Limits <b>set</b> on the <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and coronal gas parameters by observations of the Galaxy are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{details of}} a precision electronic gas flow controller designed to suit the requirements of available vacuum coating systems are presented. Its performance is {{compared with that of}} a commercially available gas flow controller. The incorporation of a precision reference source with coarse and fine controls in the present controller has not only improved its resolution and stability compared with the commercial controller, but also enabled exact <b>setting</b> of <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> even for the minimum <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> The coarse and fine controls have another major advantage in transferring the flow control system from one vacuum system to the other as it could be set with respect to any chamber volume to pump speed ratio. The performance of the controller has been studied with a reactive evaporation system in the range $ 7 ^* 10 ^{- 2 } to 1 ^* 10 ^{- 3 }$ Pa and with a reactive sputtering system in the range 13 to $ 10 ^{- 1 }$ Pa and the results are presented...|$|R
