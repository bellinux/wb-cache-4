25|$|From 29.510nbsp&MHz to 29.700, The FM {{sub-band}} {{is usually}} channelized into repeater and <b>simplex</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The channels are commonly grouped into repeater inputs, simplex, and repeater output frequencies.|$|R
50|$|FM <b>simplex</b> calling <b>frequency</b> is 1294.5 MHz.|$|R

50|$|At {{the scene}} of an incident, VHF and UHF <b>simplex</b> <b>frequencies</b> are {{generally}} used. These are usually common between NZFS, NRFA, DoC and NZDF firefighters and discrete from the Police. Access to shared liaison channels is also provided, allowing for Ambulance, Police, Fire and other resources (for example aircraft that may be called upon to assist in firefighting) to co-ordinate.|$|R
50|$|This {{first set}} of {{frequencies}} shows the split frequency pairs used in duplex operational mode, often used with repeaters. <b>Simplex</b> (same <b>frequency</b> for receiving and transmitting) mode only utilizes the lower set of frequencies.|$|R
50|$|Dual-mode GMRS/FRS {{equipment}} is also approved in Brazil (GMRS only in <b>simplex</b> mode, GMRS <b>frequencies</b> 462.550, 467.550, 462.725, 467.725 are not allowed) {{and most other}} South American countries. Portable radios are heavily used in private communications, mainly by security staff in nightclubs and malls, but also in private parking, maintenance, and delivery services.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} method {{of working for}} radiotelephones is half-duplex, operation, which allows one person to talk {{and the other to}} listen alternately. If a single channel is used, both ends take turns to {{transmit}} on it. An eavesdropper would hear both sides of the conversation. Dual-frequency working splits the communication into two separate channels, but only one is used to transmit at a time. The end users have the same experience as single <b>frequency</b> <b>simplex</b> but an eavesdropper with one receiver would only hear one side of the conversation.|$|R
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{behavior of}} one-locus viability selection models is studied numerically. The selection schemes include randomly chosen viabilities, viabilities chosen to measure a hypothetical {{distance between the}} alleles making up the genotype and viabilities that obey various allelic dominance relations. From 3 to 8 alleles are considered. Among the key conclusions are (1) equilibria that are most polymorphic do not usually have the highest mean fitness, (2) the more structure {{there is in the}} choice of the viability model, the greater is the level of polymorphism at equilibrium, and (3) for the numbers of alleles chosen here, the equilibrium reached by iteration from the centroid of the allele <b>frequency</b> <b>simplex</b> is the best predictor of the equilibrium attainable from randomly chosen starting vectors. Preliminary evidence shows {{that this is not the}} case for 16 alleles...|$|R
40|$|In current practice, firefighters’ {{communications}} systems are verbal, using a <b>simplex</b> Radio <b>Frequency</b> (RF) system (walkie-talkie). They use a push-to-talk mechanism {{in which only}} one person can talk {{at any time and}} all other firefighters will hear the messages. They use special codes (e. g. 1008, 1009, etc.) to express their current situation. Firefighters of the same team need to be in visual contact with each other at all times. This RF system does not support other functionalities (e. g. video communications, conference calls). In addition, because communication between firefighters is a flat structure, private communications is not possible. Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) are infrastructure-less and self-organized wireless networks of mobile devices, which are not based on any centralized control. MANETs are suitable for the hosting {{of a wide range of}} applications in emergency situations, such as natural or human-induced disasters, and military and commercial settings. Multimedia conferencing is an important category of application that can be deployed in MANETs. This includes well-known sets of applications, such as audio/video conferencing, data communications, and multiplayer games. Conferencing can be defined as the conversational exchange of data content between several parties. Conferencing requires, at the very least, the opening of two sessions: a call signaling session, and a media handling session. Call signaling is used to set up, modify, and terminate the conference. Media handling is used to cover the transportation of the media, and to control/manage the media mixers and media connections. So far, very little attention has been devoted to the firefighters’ communication system. In the present work, we focus on building a new communication system for firefighters using multimedia conferencing/sub-conferencing in MANETs. The background information for the firefighters’ current communications system and MANETs, along with the multimedia conferencing, is provided. The limitations of this system are determined, and the requirements are derived to determine the functionalities of a better communication system that will overcome current limitations. We have proposed a cluster-based signaling architecture that meets our requirements. We have also identified a state-of-the-art media handling and mixing system that meets most of our requirements, and have adapted it to inter-work with our signaling system. We have implemented the proposed architecture using SIP signaling protocol. Performance measurements have been performed on the prototype. Through experiments, we have found that the new multimedia communication system is a very promising approach to solve the current firefighters’ communication problems. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the frequency of skin lesions in kidney transplant recipients. Materials and Methods: A total of 681 kidney transplant recipients were followed at Shaheed Labbafinejad transplant center in Tehran, Iran. Skin lesions were evaluated, and diagnoses were made clinically and confirmed by lesion smear, tissue biopsy, tissue culture, and serologic examinations, as indicated. Results : Skin lesions were found in 54 patients (7. 9 %), and their frequencies were as follows: dermatomal herpes zoster (18 patients, 2. 6 %, 13 men and 5 women), herpes simplex infection of face and lips (15 patients, 2. 2 %, 5 men and 10 women), chickenpox (6 patients, 0. 9 %, 5 men and 1 woman), Kaposi's sarcoma (5 patients, 0. 7 %, 3 men and 2 women), warts (4 women, 2 of whom had genital warts), pyoderma gangrenosum (1 man, 0. 14 %), multiple fungal abscesses of the leg (1 man, 0. 14 %), mucormycosis (1 man, 0. 14 %), and molluscum contagiosum (1 man, 0. 14 %). Moreover, 2 women (0. 3 %) had generalized herpes <b>simplex</b> lesions. Conclusion: <b>Frequencies</b> of herpes zoster (3. 5 %), herpes simplex (2. 5 %), and human papillomavirus (0. 6 %) infections in our kidney transplant recipients were low. We recommend that all kidney transplant candidates be evaluated and immunized for herpes zoster virus before transplantation, all herpetic-form lesions of these patients be reported to physicians (even mild lesions), and finally, that all human papillomavirus lesions be diagnosed and treated promptly to prevent more serious lesions such as malignancies. </p...|$|R
