50|$|This Chapter {{describes}} the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> {{as well as}} relations to other agreements.

Countries may impose stricter measures than the treaty requires (Article 2) and should share (confidential) information for law enforcement purposes (Article 4). The treaty explicitly also applies to free zones (Article 5).|$|E

50|$|According to {{the legal}} {{services}} of the European Parliament, the agreement does neither include nor exclude the waters of Western Sahara from its geographical scope, and it would thus be up to Morocco to comply with its international obligations.

Notwithstanding the positive legal opinion, a large minority in the European Parliament asked for the explicit exclusion of Western Sahara from the geographical <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement.</b> Finally, the Parliament adopted the treaty, asking the Council to strengthen the monitoring mechanisms.|$|E

5000|$|The TBT Agreement can {{be divided}} into five parts. The first part defines the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreement</b> which {{includes}} “all products, including industrial and agricultural" [...] but not sanitary and phytosanitary measures. The second part sets out the obligations and principles concerning technical regulations. The third part addresses conformity and assessments of conformity.

50|$|Despite this assistance, {{there was}} still {{considerable}} distrust between the two domains. On March 1, 1866, the Shogunate demanded the retirement and confinement of Chōshū daimyō Mōri Takachika and the reduction of domain revenues by 100,000 koku. This enraged the Chōshū leadership, {{and led to a}} formal, six-point agreement with Satsuma. The <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> was fairly limited. Satsuma agreed to assist Chōshū in obtaining a pardon from the Imperial Court. If this failed and the Shogunate attacked, Satsuma would send 2000 troops to Kyoto; however, Satsuma would engage the Shogunate in combat only if Kuwana, Aizu or Tokugawa Yoshinobu's personal guard attempted to block Satsuma's access to the Emperor.|$|E
50|$|For what {{concerns}} whether {{the duty of}} non-recognition is binding also upon international organisations, these are bound as much as States are, to respect such a duty of non-recognition, and the European Court of Justice has recognised that the Community is bound to respect customary international law. Moreover, even if member states have no subsidiary responsibility for the action of and international organisation with its area of exclusive competence, {{they do have a}} separate responsibility for breach of obligation incumbent upon them when acting within intergovernmental bodies, in terms of their individual conduct at the time of voting. In the case of the FPA any good faith exemption would be rejected due to the clear unwillingness by the EU institutions to exclude explicitly Western Sahara from the geographical <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{attempts}} to address climate change {{many states have}} introduced subsidy programmes {{in order to increase}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> renewable energy. Among such subsidy programmes Feed-in Tariffs (FITs) are among the most common and most successful. However, with the increase in <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> such subsidisation programmes there has been a significant rise in disputes in the WTO questioning whether such measures, including FITs, are compatible with WTO law, particularly with <b>the</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement). Therefore, this dissertation aims to clarify the WTO law on subsidies in <b>the</b> SCM <b>Agreement</b> with respect to FIT programmes in order to assess WTO member states’ possibilities to maintain such measures in place. Using a model FIT based on common characteristics of FIT programmes, it is assessed whether FIT programmes fulfil the requirements to constitute a specific subsidy in <b>the</b> SCM <b>Agreement</b> or whether such measures are not considered specific subsidies and thus fall outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SCM <b>Agreement.</b> It is concluded that, due largely to how the Appellate Body in recent case law has defined the relevant market, it will be possible for states to design FIT programmes so {{that they will not be}} considered to confer a benefit and thus do not fulfil the requirements in <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> a subsidy in <b>the</b> SCM <b>Agreement</b> and consequently fall outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SCM <b>Agreement.</b> It is, however, also concluded that there is still a need for states to be mindful <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tariff level when designing FIT programmes in order for such programmes not to fall within <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SCM <b>Agreement.</b> Lastly, <b>the</b> implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent case law for the subsidy regime are also discussed...|$|R

50|$|The SER and the LCDR {{agreed to}} pool Continental traffic {{receipts}} between Hastings and Margate, together with local receipts to Dover and Folkestone.

The agreement appeared to unduly favour the LCDR, particularly after 1870. It did not prevent competition as the railways could claim additional funds from the pool if they carried more than their proportion of customers. Both companies sought to get round the agreement - the LCDR by establishing a Continental service from Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey, which was outside the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement.</b> Similarly, the SER built a local station at Shorncliffe {{on the edge of}} Folkestone, which it claimed was not part of Folkestone, and from which it charged lower fares.|$|E
