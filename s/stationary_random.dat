50|$|Since {{a random}} process {{does not have}} a Fourier transform, the {{condition}} under which the sum converges to the original function must also be different. A <b>stationary</b> <b>random</b> process does have an autocorrelation function and hence a spectral density according to the Wiener-Khinchin theorem.

In this case the non-stationarity can be removed from the data by first differencing, and the differenced variable [...] will have a long-run mean of c and hence no drift. But {{even in the}} absence of the parameter c (that is, even if c=0), this unit root process exhibits drift, and specifically stochastic drift, due to the presence of the <b>stationary</b> <b>random</b> shocks ut: a once-occurring non-zero value of u is incorporated into the same period's y, which one period later becomes the one-period-lagged value of y and hence affects the new period's y value, which itself in the next period becomes the lagged y and affects the next y value, and so forth forever. So after the initial shock hits y, its value is incorporated forever into the mean of y, so we have stochastic drift. Again this drift can be removed by first differencing y to obtain z which does not drift.|$|E
