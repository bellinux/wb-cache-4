As the treatment carried on, the micro-apertures are filled with diffused solute atoms and integrated with each other. As a result, the relative density increases and secondary phases tend to be distributed closely with the crystalline grains of matrix. In this case, plastic deformation occurs and dimples emerge due to secondary phases from matrix micro-structures under the action of external stress. Cracks propagate and the Al–Cu–Mn alloy breaks through the ductile fracture mechanism.|$|R

Zhoushen Well X 1 is a {{deep and}} {{exploration}} well, there are some difficulties in drilling fluids treating: The borehole is large, the open hole is long and the rock density proportion is high in the overlying strata.

So the key point is ensuring well wall stability and preventing swelling and <b>hole</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> The drilling fluids must have strong Calcium-tolerance and good compatibility with formation for coping the swelling and <b>hole</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the high conductivity mudstone in the deep well section.

40|$|Technical Al-Si base cast alloys always contain {{amounts of}} Fe and Mn, {{especially}} alloys extracted from scrap. During casting, Fe and Mn containing intermetallics, such as Al-Fe, Al-Fe-Si and Al-Fe-Mn-Si phases, are formed between the aluminum dendrites. Fe and Mn-rich intermetallic phases {{with a needle}} to plate-like morphology strongly affect the interdendritic feeding. They induce porosity and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>holes</b> and also have {{detrimental effects on the}} mechanical properties in Al-Si alloys.

40|$|The present paper {{studies the}} {{reliability}} {{analysis of the}} casting process in foundry work using a probabilistic approach. As foundry industries {{in many developing countries}} suffer from poor quality of casting due to improper management, lack of resources and wrong working methods followed, which results in the decrement of productivity. Hence, to ensure the quality and productivity, favorable steps must be taken. The considered casting system has four main types of defects; namely mold shift, shrinkage, cold shut and blowholes. The complete casting system can fail due to the misalignment of the mold and combination of defects such as <b>shrinkage</b> and blow <b>holes</b> and can also fail by defects of <b>shrinkage,</b> blow <b>holes</b> and cold shut, simultaneously. The system is analyzed {{with the help of the}} supplementary variable technique and Laplace transformation.

30|$|From the data, it was {{interpreted}} that the diffusion velocity of solute atoms is accelerated during heat treatment {{which leads to}} casting defects such as <b>shrinkage</b> <b>holes</b> {{and the removal of}} shrinkage porosities which eliminates micro-segregation. Composition and micro-structures tend to be homogeneously distributed due to the long time and high temperature during the process of solution treatment. At the same time, the ability of Y to diffuse into matrix improves and the dispersion strengthening effect of the θ phase enhances improvements in the matrix strength. In the absence of Y, other segregation tends to be more homogeneously distributed on GBs. Furthermore, the degree of connection between grains is strengthened and the continuity of phases distributed on GBs and deformation compatibility between the various grains are also reinforced. Under the action of tensile stress, cracks cannot be born in GBs of the studied alloy. If stress reaches the limit point of tensile strength, plastic deformation occurs and dimples are formed due to the matrix and second phases separating from each other. Microscopic holes will form and grow up to connect with each other at the interface of inclusions of the secondary phases. Meanwhile, as the deformation progresses, the size of dimples becomes deeper and larger and its edges are cracked as well, eventually white mesh tearing ridges are formed as shown in the figures below suggesting that trans-granular fractures are present.|$|R

30|$|In general, barrier {{materials}} must {{conform to}} three different performance criteria: stability, integrity and insulation ([Babrauskas 2009]). Stability {{implies that the}} barrier construction remains, more or less, intact when exposed to a fire or heat source (minimal <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>hole</b> formation). Integrity implies that the barrier material prevents easy pass-through of flames, heat, and volatiles (either through the barrier material itself or its char). Insulation refers to a minimal change in temperature of the unexposed face due to heat transfer through the barrier material. Minimal char shrinkage and retention of non-zero char tensile strength are other key factors in good fire resistance.|$|R

The research involved using different types of tools (high-performance Ham solid carbide drill bits and diamond drill bits).

Measurements of shrinkage were performed {{with the help of}} ATOS III Triple Scan XL scanning system immediately after treatment and in 48  h thereafter. Based on the scanned polygonal mesh of each hole, three-dimensional models of holes drilled in the samples were built. Then, these models were verified against nominal drillings using GOM Inspect software. In this way, the values of rheonomic shrinkage were obtained.

Elastic rheonomic aftereffect of the material and reduction of the diameter of holes depends on the forces acting during cutting.

30|$|The {{preservation}} of the wellbore stability has fundamental importance during oil and gas well drilling. About 75  % of the side walls {{of oil and gas}} wellbores consist of shale and mud rocks, which are responsible for 90  % of the wellbore instability problems (Corrêa and Nascimento 2005; Jiang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2012 a, b; Huang et al. 2007). Several types of shales with a significant amount of clay minerals are very reactive once they come into contact with water, and they can cause serious wellbore instability during drilling, like <b>hole</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>hole</b> sloughing and caving (Hisham 2006; Wang et al. 2012 a, b; Zhang et al. 2013 a, b). Wellbore stability has been studied for a long time using mainly two quite different approaches. Some authors consider the problem exclusively {{from the point of view}} of rock mechanics and others from the point of view of chemical interactions between shales and fluids (Wu et al. 1993; Corrêa and Nascimento 2005). Based on the second approach, a variety of water-based drilling fluids and non-aqueous fluids have been applied; meanwhile, many types of wellbore stabilizers have been developed. These wellbore stabilizers have been classified into several groups, including inorganic salts, formate, polymers with special shale affinity, asphalts, sugars and sugar derivatives, glycerol, polyalcohol, and silicates (Van Oort 2003; Guo et al. 2006; Khodja et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2011; Zhong et al. 2011). Among of them, asphalts as one type of cheap and effective stabilizer can improve wellbore stabilization mainly through plugging or sealing, and they have been divided into four varieties according to modification methods: natural asphalt (no modification, mined from deposit), oxidized asphalt (oxidation by air blown to heighten softening point), sulfonated bitumen (changed into asphalt sulfonate partly to enhance water solubility), and emulsified asphalt (oil in water emulsion to improve dispersion in the drilling fluid and adsorption on the rock surface) (Sharma and Wunderlich 1987; Wang et al. 2005). All types of emulsified asphalts are mostly produced by shearing and thinning a mixture of asphalt, water, and emulsifier using an emulsion machine or a colloid mill. Ionic surfactants are often used as emulsifier, so the emulsified asphalt droplets are mostly charged and possess an electric double layer structure, according to the Stern model (Xie et al. 2005; Fan et al. 2014). Cationic emulsified asphalts have taken the place of anionic ones in drilling fluids to promote inhibition and adsorption (Shi et al. 2003; Wang and Xia 2006). In this paper, a novel cationic emulsified asphalt was investigated to overcome serious instability problems during drilling hydratable shale formations. It had good colloidal stability, particle size distribution, compatibility, sealing property, and flexible adaptability.|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} letter [1], we {{have demonstrated that}} corrosion of a physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating substrate system can be induced by coating defects, resulting in premature damage to the usually hard and corrosion resistant coatings. <b>Shrinkage</b> pin <b>holes,</b> {{one of the most}} common defects, allow access of solution to substrate to cause galvanic corrosion [2, 3], and this may be prevented by forming a pin-hole interrupting under or sandwich layers of passivating metals such as Al or Ti [4, 5]. Since the increasing application and development of plasma arc in various PVD techniques, owing to the capability of the arc technique to achieve relatively high metallic vapor ion valence states, surface and atom mobility and diffusivity, and consequently the greater coating-substrate adhesion [6], more attention has been paid to the study of the arc-related formation of droplet or macroparticle coating defects. Due to the nature of its formation, a macroparticle is the product of a droplet of cathode metal induced by plasma arc heating, which, after being ejected from the cathode, solidifies and becomes embedded within the coating after incomplete reaction (due to its size) within the deposition chamber gas (N-plasma, for example) during its flight to the substrate [7]. That is why a macroparticle is different, in addition to its great size,in chemical composition (N-content) not only from the adjacent coating matrix, but also from the particle exterior to interior parts [8]. The composition inconsistency of the droplets rendered the defects to galvanic coupling (anodic to the adjacent coating matrix) to corrode first upon contact with aqueous solutions, and with progression, this eventually led to the penetration of solutions to the substrate to cause more severe crevice corrosion [9]. The severity of such droplet-induced corrosion depends on many factors but generally droplets are regarded to be detrimental as far as their effect on the overall coating's corrosion performance is concerned [10 - 12]...|$|R

The name “high {{strength}} brass ” {{is given}} to the wrought and cast alloys indicating their particular virtue of high strength, which can be achieved by additions of Al, Fe, Mn and Sn. Forgings made from copper base alloys offer a number of advantages over products made by other processes.

In this study, we investigated the microstructures and mechanical properties of high strength brass made by semi solid forging and compared them with those of conventionally forged product and gravity die casting. No <b>shrinkage</b> or gas <b>hole</b> was found in semi solid forgings. Fine equiaxed crystals developed at the center of semi solid forgings, while grains in the corner of semi solid forgings were elongated perpendicular to the pressure direction.

Casting defect analysis is carried out using techniques like historical data analysis, cause-effect diagrams, design of experiments and root cause analysis. Data from X-ray inspection (Radiographic Inspection) have been collected along with the production parameter data. Using check sheets data has been collected and all the defects have been studied.

40|$|AbstractHigh {{strength-to-weight ratio}} of {{non-ferrous}} alloys, such as aluminium, magnesium and titanium alloys, {{are considered to}} be possible replacement of widely accepted steels in transportation and automobile sectors. Among these alloys, magnesium is self explosive and titanium is costlier, and aluminium is most likely to replace steels. Application of aluminium or its alloys is also thought of as an appropriate replacement in defence field, especially to enhance the easiness in mobility of combat vehicles while maintaining the same standard as that of conventional armour grade steels. Hence most of the investigations have been confined to aluminium or its alloys as base material and open an era of developing the newer composite materials to address the major limitation, i. e. tribological properties. The surface composites can be fabricated by incorporating the ceramic carbides like silicon carbide, carbides of transition metals and oxides of aluminium using surface modification techniques, such as high energy laser melt treatment, high energy electron beam irradiation and thermal spray process which are based on fusion route. These techniques yield the fusion related problems, such as interfacial reaction, pin <b>holes,</b> <b>shrinkage</b> cavities or voids and other casting related defects, and pave the way to need of an efficient technique which must be based on solid state. Recently developed friction stir processing technique was used in the present investigation for surface modification of AA 7075 aluminum alloy, which is an alternative to steels. In the present investigation, 160  μm sized boron carbide powder was procured and was reduced to 60  μm and 30  μm using high energy ball mill. Subsequently these powders were used to fabricate the surface composites using friction stir processing. Ballistic performance testing as per the military standard (JIS. 0108. 01) was carried out. In the present work, an analytical method of predicting the ballistic behavior of surface composites was developed. This method was based on energy balance, i. e., the initial energy of impact is same as that of energy absorbed by multi layers. An attempt also has been made to validate the analytical results with the experimental findings. Variation between the analytical and experimental results may be accounted due to the assumptions considering such as isotropic behavior of target and shearing area of contact as cylindrical instead of conical interface As the analytical model yields the ballistic performance in the closer proximity of experimentally obtained, it can be considered to be an approximation to evaluate the ballistic performance of targets...|$|R
