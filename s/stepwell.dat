5|$|In 1473 the Gujarat Sultan Mahmud Begada sacked {{the city}} and {{destroyed}} the temple of Dwarka. The Jagat Mandir or the Dwarakadhisa temple was later rebuilt. Vallabha Acharya retrieved an idol of Dwarkadhish, which was revered by Rukmini. He hid it in a <b>stepwell,</b> known as Savitri vav, during the Muslim invasion, before moving it to Ladva village. In 1551, when Turk Aziz invaded Dwarka, the idol was shifted to the island of Bet Dwarka.|$|E
25|$|To {{the west}} of the mosque complex is a 1.7 meter deep <b>stepwell</b> with a pond of 3.8 meter deep used to perform ablution. Normally, a <b>stepwell</b> is located in the front of a mosque, however the <b>stepwell</b> of the Kasunyatan Mosque is located at the back (west) of the mosque, being closer to a former river (now a lake) to {{the west of}} the mosque. This water well is now covered with {{corrugated}} steel roof.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{alliance}} policy, Chand Bibi was marriuued to Ali Adil Shah I of the Bijapur Sultanate. A <b>stepwell</b> (bawdi) constructed near the eastern boundary of Bijapur {{by her husband}} was named Chand Bawdi after her.|$|E
50|$|The Mughal rulers did not {{disrupt the}} culture that was practiced in these <b>stepwells</b> and {{encouraged}} the building of <b>stepwells.</b> The authorities during the British Raj found the hygiene of the <b>stepwells</b> less than desirable and installed pipe and pump systems to replace their purpose.|$|R
5000|$|Stepped ponds {{are very}} similar to <b>stepwells</b> in terms of purpose but it is {{important}} to recognize the difference between these two types of structures. For example, stepped ponds were always built to accompany a nearby temple while <b>stepwells</b> were positioned away from noisy sites and future tourist attractions. [...] While <b>stepwells</b> are dark and barely visible from the surface, stepped ponds are illuminated by the light from the sun. Also, <b>stepwells</b> are quite linear in design compared to the rectangular shape of stepped ponds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>stepwells</b> at Dhank in Rajkot {{district}} are {{dated to}} 550-625 AD. The stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850-950 AD) {{are followed by}} it. The <b>stepwells</b> were constructed in the south western region of Gujarat around 600 AD; from there they spread north to Rajasthan and subsequently to north and west India. Initially used {{as an art form}} by Hindus, the construction of these <b>stepwells</b> hit its peak during Muslim rule from the 11th to 16th century.|$|R
25|$|Mulji {{would often}} {{travel to the}} village of Shekhpat to visit Ramanand Swami and listen to his {{religious}} discourses. He formed a lasting friendship with Lalji Suthar, a native of Shekhpat who shared Mulji’s zeal for Ramanand Swami’s philosophies and who would later become Nishkulanand Swami, one of Swaminarayan’s prominent sadhu disciples. For a period, they would meet every evening at a small shrine to Shiva on a <b>stepwell</b> in the village of Kiri between their respective villages and discuss various religious matters.|$|E
25|$|A small baoli, {{discovered}} {{five years}} ago in Dwarka, has been restored and could become a tourist attraction. An elaborate conservation project by the India National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) for the Lodi-era baoli was completed recently. Dwarka Baoli (also known as Loharehri Baoli) is a historical <b>stepwell</b> recently discovered in Dwarka Sub City, in south west New Delhi, India. It was constructed for the residents of Loharehri village by the Sultans of the Lodi Dynasty in the early 16th century. Dwarka now stands where the Loharehri village once stood.|$|E
25|$|Stepwell: Earliest clear {{evidence}} {{of the origins of}} the <b>stepwell</b> is found in the Indus Valley Civilization's archaeological site at Mohenjodaro in Pakistan. The three features of stepwells in the subcontinent are evident from one particular site, abandoned by 2500 BCE, which combines a bathing pool, steps leading down to water, and figures of some religious importance into one structure. The early centuries immediately before the common era saw the Buddhists and the Jains of India adapt the stepwells into their architecture. Both the wells and the form of ritual bathing reached {{other parts of the world}} with Buddhism. Rock-cut step wells in the subcontinent date from 200-400 CE. Subsequently the wells at Dhank (550-625 CE) and stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850-950 CE) were constructed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stepwells</b> {{are common}} in the west of India. In these wells, the water may be reached by {{descending}} a set of steps. They may be covered and are often of architectural significance. Many <b>stepwells</b> were also used for leisure, providing relief from the daytime heat.|$|R
25|$|<b>Stepwells</b> have mainly {{been used}} in Indian subcontinent.|$|R
50|$|While early <b>stepwells</b> {{were made}} of stone, later step wells {{were made of}} mortar, stucco, rubble and laminar stones. The well {{cylinder}} was the basic form used to deepen the wells. It is also inferred that the <b>Stepwells</b> in Gujarat have survived so long {{in view of the}} builder’s knowledge of the soil conditions and the earthquake proneness of the region.|$|R
25|$|Rajasthan {{is famous}} for its forts, carved temples, and {{decorated}} havelis, which were built by Rajput kings in pre-Muslim era Rajasthan. Rajasthan's Jaipur Jantar Mantar, Mehrangarh Fort and <b>Stepwell</b> of Jodhpur, Dilwara Temples, Chittor Fort, Lake Palace, miniature paintings in Bundi, and numerous city palaces and haveli's are part of the architectural heritage of India. Jaipur, the Pink City, is noted for the ancient houses made of a type of sandstone dominated by a pink hue. In Jodhpur, maximum houses are painted blue. At Ajmer, there is white marble Bara-dari on the Anasagar lake. Jain Temples dot Rajasthan from north to south and east to west. Dilwara Temples of Mount Abu, Ranakpur Temple dedicated to Lord Adinath in Pali District, Jain temples in the fort complexes of Chittor, Jaisalmer and Kumbhalgarh, Lodurva Jain temples, Mirpur Jain Temple of Sirohi, Sarun Mata Temple kotputli, Bhandasar and Karni Mata Temple of Bikaner and Mandore of Jodhpur {{are some of the best}} examples.|$|E
50|$|The Suda <b>stepwell</b> in Mahuva (1381 AD), Hani <b>stepwell</b> in Dhandhusar (1389/1333 AD) and Siddhnath Mahadev <b>stepwell</b> in Dholka {{were built}} during Tughlak rule in Gujarat. The <b>stepwell</b> of Sampa near Ahmedabad {{was built in}} 1328 AD. The Rajba <b>stepwell</b> of Rampura near Wadhwan and the Wadhwani <b>stepwell</b> in Khambhat were built in 1483 and 1482 {{respectively}} based on the earlier Madha <b>stepwell</b> of Wadhwan. The Dada Harir <b>Stepwell</b> was built in 1499 by the harem lady of Mahmud Begada.|$|E
50|$|According to legend, the <b>stepwell</b> was dry {{for twelve}} years after its construction. The royal astrologer {{predicted}} the need of sacrifice by an ideal couple for water in the <b>stepwell.</b> The prince and her wife agreed for welfare of people {{even though they had}} an infant. They descended the <b>stepwell</b> in bridal clothes. As they reached the seventh step, the <b>stepwell</b> filled with water and they drowned. They sacrifice ensured water in the <b>stepwell.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Stepwells</b> are {{examples}} of the many types of storage and irrigation tanks that were developed in India, mainly to cope with seasonal fluctuations in water availability. A basic difference between <b>stepwells</b> on the one hand, and tanks and wells on the other, {{is to make it}} easier for people to reach the ground water and to maintain and manage the well.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stepwells</b> from Mughal periods {{still exist}} in Pakistan. Some are in {{preserved}} conditions {{while others are}} not.|$|R

50|$|The <b>stepwell</b> {{as a form}} {{of artistic}} {{architecture}} started during the Chaulukya period. The <b>stepwell</b> situated west of kund of Modhera Sun Temple may belong to the 11th century whereas the mandapa above ground is from the 10th century. The Rani ki vav (the Queen's <b>stepwell)</b> of Patan was constructed around 1050 AD. Ankol Mata <b>stepwell</b> at Davad and Mata Bhavani's <b>Stepwell</b> in Ahmedabad belonged to the third quarter of the 11th century.|$|E
50|$|Several stepwells are plain {{in design}} without any {{ornamentation}} {{which makes it}} difficult to ascertain their period, but they may belong to the 16th or 17th century. Such stepwells are in Hampur and Idar, as well as the Matri <b>stepwell</b> in Kankavati and Gyaneshwari <b>stepwell</b> in Modhera. The <b>stepwell</b> of Mandva in north Gujarat {{is similar to that of}} Mahemdavad so may belong to that period. The Sindhvai Mata <b>stepwell</b> in Patan has an inscription dating to 1633 AD. The Ravli <b>stepwell</b> of Mangrol is of the 17th century. The <b>stepwell</b> in Limboi near Idar has Chaulukya style ornamentation and hs been dated to 1629 AD.|$|E
50|$|Several stepwells are {{ascribed}} to Minaldevi, {{the mother of}} Chaulukya ruler Jayasimha Siddharaja. The lake in Viramgam and a <b>stepwell</b> in Nadiad are {{ascribed to}} her. The Minal <b>stepwell</b> in Balej village in Sabarkantha district is ascribed to her and was built in 1095 AD (Samvat 1152). Another Minaldevi Vav in Virpur in Rajkot district is also ascribed to her and has stylistic affinities to Chaulukya architecture. Asapuri <b>stepwell</b> of Ahmedabad and the <b>stepwell</b> of Jhinjhuwada are of the 12th century. The Chaumukhi <b>stepwell</b> of Chobari in Surendranagar district depicts religious figures similar to nearby temples. the two stepwells in Kaleshwari-Ni Nal near Lunawada resemble Rani ki Vav in iconography so they may belong {{to the end of}} the 10th century. The <b>stepwell</b> in Dhandhalpur is ascribed to Jayasimha Siddharaja. During the reign of Kumarapala in the 12th century, several stepwells were constructed. The <b>stepwell</b> at Vayad near Patan was built during this time. Ganga <b>stepwell</b> at Wadhwan has been dated to 1169 AD (Samvat 1225).|$|E
50|$|Due to waterpumps and pipe-systems, the <b>stepwells</b> {{lost their}} {{significance}} {{and due to}} economic cost, they were not constructed thereafter.|$|R
50|$|Provision of {{drinking}} water through piping water supply, use of tubewells and abolition of <b>stepwells</b> are effective measures on community level.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stepwells</b> are wells or ponds {{in which}} the water is reached by {{descending}} a set of steps. They may be multi-storied with a bullock turning a water wheel to raise the well water to {{the first or second}} floor. They are most common in western India and are also found in the other more arid regions of South Asia, extending into Pakistan. The construction of <b>stepwells</b> is mainly utilitarian, though they may include embellishments of architectural significance.|$|R
