Based on an analysis of market data, a sufficiently large market for services is projected {{so as to make}} the system economically viable. A large market, and hence a high capacity satellite system, is found to be necessary to minimize service costs, i. e., economy of scale is found to hold. The wide bandwidth expected to be available in the 30 / 20 GHz band, along with frequency reuse which further increases the effective system bandwidth, makes possible the high capacity system. Extensive ground networking is required in most systems to both connect users into the system and to interconnect Earth stations to provide spatial diversity.

40|$|Using the {{adoption}} of SFAS 131 as an exogenous change in disclosure quality of segment information, this study examines the impact of SFAS 131 on internal capital market efficiency and firm value. It finds that diversified firms that changed their <b>segment</b> <b>definitions</b> on adopting SFAS 131 (i. e., "change firms") experienced greater improvement in capital allocation efficiency in internal capital markets in the postSFAS 131 period relative to the pre-SFAS 131 period than did a control sample of diversified firms that did not change their <b>segment</b> <b>definitions</b> (i. e., "no-change firms"). This result holds in a battery of tests designed to correct for the endogeneity in firms' reporting choices following SFAS 131, suggesting that disclosure quality improves external monitoring and therefore investment efficiency. This study further shows that the improvement in capital allocation efficiency was achieved primarily by firms whose boards of directors were relatively less independent in the pre-SFAS 131 period, suggesting that the strength of internal monitoring moderates the effect of disclosure quality (as a mechanism of external monitoring) on investment efficiency. In addition, it finds that proprietary costs moderate the impact of SFAS 131 on firm value. Specifically, change firms experienced a greater increase in firm value in the post-SFAS 131 period relative to the pre-SFAS 131 period than did no-change firms except for a subsample of firms with high proprietary costs, suggesting that SFAS 131 reduced agency costs but also eroded competitive advantages...|$|R

Thereby, the evaluation of weighted mean skin temperatures is a key parameter which is influenced by several effects. A wide variation of local skin temperatures influences area measurements, if such values are derived from single-point measurements.

This paper suggests a scheme for “up-front, ” capture-time indexing of digital video streams, whereby the indexing information logically {{becomes part of}} the stream. This approach takes advantage of the sequential, temporal nature of capture and the knowledge of the stream recorder to empower further manipulation and playout of the stream.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain the lower limb {{kinematics}} from skin-based markers, the soft tissue artefact (STA) has to be compensated. Global optimization (GO) methods rely on a predefined kinematic model and attempt to limit STA by minimizing the differences between model predicted and skin-based marker positions. Thus, the reliability of GO methods depends directly on the chosen model, whose influence is not well known yet. This study develops a GO method that allows to easily implement different sets of joint constraints {{in order to assess}} their influence on the lower limb kinematics during gait. The <b>segment</b> <b>definition</b> was based on generalized coordinates giving only linear or quadratic joint constraints. Seven sets of joint constraints were assessed, corresponding to different kinematic models at the ankle, knee and hip: SSS, USS, PSS, SHS, SPS, UHS and PPS (where S, U and H stand for spherical, universal and hinge joint and P for parallel mechanism). GO was applied to gait data from five healthy males. Results showed that the lower limb kinematics, except hip kinematics, knee and ankle flexion-extension, significantly depend on the chosen ankle and knee constraints. The knee parallel mechanism generated some typical knee rotation patterns previously observed in lower limb kinematic studies. Furthermore, only the parallel mechanisms produced joint displacements. Thus, GO using parallel mechanism seems promising. It also offers some perspectives of subject-specific joint constraints...|$|E
40|$|Background— Carotid intima-media {{thickness}} (IMT) {{is increasingly}} {{used as a}} surrogate marker for atherosclerosis. Its use relies {{on its ability to}} predict future clinical cardiovascular end points. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of data to examine this association. Methods and Results— Using a prespecified search strategy, we identified 8 relevant studies and compared study design, measurement protocols, and reported data. We identified sources of heterogeneity between studies. The assumption of a linear relationship between IMT and risk was challenged by use of a graphical technique. To obtain a pooled estimate of the relative risk per IMT difference, we performed a meta-analysis based on random effects models. The age- and sex-adjusted overall estimates of the relative risk of myocardial infarction were 1. 26 (95 % CI, 1. 21 to 1. 30) per 1 –standard deviation common carotid artery IMT difference and 1. 15 (95 % CI, 1. 12 to 1. 17) per 0. 10 -mm common carotid artery IMT difference. The age- and sex-adjusted relative risks of stroke were 1. 32 (95 % CI, 1. 27 to 1. 38) per 1 –standard deviation common carotid artery IMT difference and 1. 18 (95 % CI, 1. 16 to 1. 21) per 0. 10 -mm common carotid artery IMT difference. Major sources of heterogeneity were age distribution, carotid <b>segment</b> <b>definition,</b> and IMT measurement protocol. The relationship between IMT and risk was nonlinear, but the linear models fitted relatively well for moderate to high IMT values. Conclusions— Carotid IMT is a strong predictor of future vascular events. The relative risk per IMT difference is slightly higher for the end point stroke than for myocardial infarction. In future IMT studies, ultrasound protocols should be aligned with published studies. Data for younger individuals are limited and more studies are required...|$|E

40|$|Background: The greater {{trochanter}} marker {{is commonly}} used in 3 -dimensional (3 D) models; however, its influence on hip and knee kinematics during gait is unclear. Understanding {{the influence of the}} greater trochanter marker is important when quantifying frontal and transverse plane hip and knee kinematics, parameters which are particularly relevant to investigate in individuals with conditions such as patellofemoral pain, knee osteoarthritis, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, and hip pain. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of including the greater trochanter in the construction of the thigh segment on hip and knee kinematics during gait. Methods: 3 D kinematics were collected in 19 healthy subjects during walking using a surface marker system. Hip and knee angles were compared across two thigh <b>segment</b> <b>definitions</b> (with and without greater trochanter) at two time points during stance: peak knee flexion (PKF) and minimum knee flexion (MinKF). Results: Hip and knee angles differed in magnitude and direction in the transverse plane at both time points. In the thigh model with the greater trochanter the hip was more externally rotated than in the thigh model without the greater trochanter (PKF: − 9. 34 ° ±  5. 21 ° vs. 1. 40 ° ±  5. 22 °, MinKF: − 5. 68 ° ±  4. 24 ° vs. 5. 01 ° ±  4. 86 °; p <  0. 001). In the thigh model with the greater trochanter, the knee angle was more internally rotated compared to the knee angle calculated using the thigh definition without the greater trochanter (PKF: 14. 67 ° ±  6. 78 ° vs. 4. 33 ° ±  4. 18 °, MinKF: 10. 54 ° ±  6. 71 ° vs. − 0. 01 ° ±  2. 69 °; p <  0. 001). Small but significant differences were detected in the sagittal and frontal plane angles at both time points (p <  0. 001). Conclusion: Hip and knee kinematics differed across different <b>segment</b> <b>definitions</b> including or excluding the greater trochanter marker, especially in the transverse plane. Therefore when considering whether to include the greater trochanter in the thigh segment model when using a surface markers to calculate 3 D kinematics for movement assessment, it is important to have a clear understanding of the effect of different marker sets and segment models in use...|$|R

40|$|The Oxford Foot Model (OFM) is a multi-segment foot model, which {{consists}} of three rigid segments (tibia, hindfoot and forefoot). The segments are defined by surface markers placed on bony landmarks on the foot and leg. The accuracy of the OFM angle calculations depends on how the markers and segment axes relate to the underlying anatomy. Several previous studies have reported particularly large variability in the hindfoot-tibia rotation and this finding has made gait data interpretation and, consequently, treatment recommendation more uncertain. The aim of this research project {{was to investigate the}} agreement between marker-based and anatomy-based hindfoot and tibia segment axes in the Oxford Foot Model. Twentyone adult females participated in the study (42 feet). The calcaneus and talus first principal axes, as well as 3 D coordinates of markers and of the points corresponding to the ideal marker locations, were extracted from CT images. Gait analysis was used to measure lower-limb joint kinematics during level walking trials. The results showed that there is a significant discrepancy between the OFM hindfoot (A P) axis and the calcaneus first principal axis in the transverse plane. This relationship suggested a clinical implication that the A-P axis definition in relation to the underlying anatomy is likely to be less accurate in a deformed foot like clubfoot. Moreover, the insignificant root mean squared difference between the hindfoot-tibia kinematics, estimated by a rigid-body transformation method and that computed from the standard stereophotogrammetric procedure implied that the hindfoot and tibia rigidity assumption was valid in estimating the motion of the underling anatomy from the marker-based <b>segment</b> axes <b>definition.</b> Furthermore, a discrepancy between the OFM hindfoot and tibia axes and the corrected OFM hindfoot and tibia axes in the transverse plane was evident, and this led to differences in the transverse plane joint angles during walking. Therefore it can be inferred that these two reasons instigate the large variability in transverse plane hindfoot-tibia kinematics, as reported by past literatures. This information has potential to optimise the hindfoot and tibia <b>segment</b> <b>definitions</b> in accurately describing the motion of the underlying anatomy and thus improve interpretation of gait data and subsequently treatment recommendations for patients with foot deformity...|$|R

Five participants (mean age = 24 (± 2) yrs; height = 173. 2 (± 12. 1) cm; mass = 74. 4 (± 17. 6) kg) volunteered for the study and marker placement models were applied consecutively in the same session.

Spatial-temporal values for both models were highly repeatable, as well as sagittal and frontal plane rotations of the hindfoot relative to tibia. Transverse plane rotation of the hindfoot relative to tibia and frontal and transverse plane rotations of the forefoot relative to hindfoot have generally repeatable patterns with small deviations between models, likely due to a difference in <b>segment</b> <b>definitions.</b> Foot kinematics using both the Oxford Foot and a modified Leardini model are in good agreement with previously published studies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{segmental}} information disclosures of Jordanian companies under IFRS 8 for 2009 with disclosures under IAS 14 R for 2008. Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 109 Jordanian companies is used in this research. A disclosure index checklist was constructed to assess the segmental information provided by the sample companies. In particular, the checklist collected information about: the number of segments reported; the number and type of segmental items published; the geographic <b>segment</b> <b>definitions</b> (areas) used; and the identity of the chief operating decision maker (CODM). Findings – The results suggest that segmental disclosures under IFRS 8 have increased compared to the information published under IAS 14 R. There is an increase in the number of companies disclosing segmental information while the number of business and geographic segments for which information is provided rose under IFRS 8. Items required under the previous standard (IAS 14 R) are still being provided in 2009, and the new segmental information required (if reviewed by the CODM) under IFRS 8 is also disclosed. As a result, the total number of segmental items disclosed increased. Moreover, a majority of companies identified the CODM as the chief executive officer. Research limitations/implications – This research highlights that the introduction of IFRS 8 has been associated with more Jordanian companies now disclosing segmental information. However, factors other than IFRS 8 may have contributed to the increased disclosure; these are not considered in the current paper.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} within {{the scientific community}} that a single species approach to European mixed fisheries can result in species-specific advice inconsistent with multi-species management objectives. Within the reformed Common Fisheries Policy a move toward mixed fisheries and ecosystem based management is encouraged. The overall objective {{of this research was}} to improve understanding of the complex targeting behaviour undertaken by commercial fishers. Whereby, improved understanding will enhance the ability to predict the responses to future mixed fisheries management measures and changing economic conditions within the Irish fishing industry. Irish métiers (groups of homogeneous fishing trips) highlight the complexity of fishing activities within the Irish fleet, having identified 33 otter trawl métiers and 19 in the remainder of the fleet. Métier dynamics identified over compensation to introduced management, resulting in effort displacement and increased temporal specific fishing pressure. Therefore were deemed as appropriate base units for all subsequent analyses. Two economic variables, operational fishing cost and trip landings value, considered to represent important drivers were developed. This lead to application of a general additive model to estimate and predict fuel consumption estimates according to fleet <b>segment</b> <b>definitions.</b> A linear mixed effects model with random vessel effect was developed as a method of standardising value generating an index of value per unit effort. This identified kilowatt fishing days as the most appropriate effort measure. The final investigation stage successfully amalgamated the knowledge gained into the formulation of novel Markov transition probability for a multinomial model to predict fisher métier strategy choice. This is to be incorporated into management strategy evaluation, aiding the assessment and possible impacts of future management proposals on the Irish fleet and commercial stocks around Ireland. Developments presented will benefit the progression toward optimising sustainability within a mixed fisheries approach to management through incorporation of economic considerations.
