40|$|Ketamine {{is often}} used for {{anesthesia}} in veterinary medicine. One possible comedication is the sedative α 2 -agonist medetomidine. Advantages of that combination are the compensation of side effects of the two drugs and the anesthetic-sparing effect of medetomidine. In vitro studies showed that medetomidine has an inhibitive effect on the formation of norketamine. Norketamine is the first metabolite of ketamine and is also active. It is followed by others like 6 -hydroxynorketamine and 5, 6 -dehydronorketamine (DHNK). In an in vivo pharmacokinetic study Beagle dogs under sevoflurane anesthesia (mean end-tidal concentration 3. 0 ± 0. 2 %) or following medetomidine sedation (450 μg/m 2) received 4 mg/kg racemic ketamine or 2 mg/kg S-ketamine. Blood samples were collected between 0 and 900 min after drug injection. 50 μL aliquots of plasma were pretreated by liquid-liquid extraction prior to analysis of the reconstituted extracts with a robust enantioselective capillary electrophoresis assay using highly sulfated γ-cyclodextrin as chiral selector and electrokinetic sample injection of the analytes from the extract across a short buffer plug without chiral <b>selector.</b> <b>Levels</b> of S- and R-ketamine, S- and R-norketamine, (2 S, 6 S) - and (2 R, 6 R) -hydroxynorketamine and S- and R-DHNK were determined. Data were analyzed with compartmental pharmacokinetic models which included two compartments for the ketamine and norketamine enantiomers and a single compartment for the DHNK and 6 -hydroxynorketamine stereoisomers. Medetomidine showed {{an effect on the}} formation and elimination of all metabolites. Stereoselectivities were detected for 6 -hydroxynorketamine and DHNK, but not for ketamine and norketamine...|$|R

40|$|Density level {{sets are}} mainly {{estimated}} {{using one of}} three methodologies: plug-in, excess mass, or a hybrid approach. The plug-in methods are based on replacing the unknown density by some nonparametric estimator, usually the kernel. Thus, the bandwidth selection is a fundamental problem from a practical point of view. Recently, specific <b>selectors</b> for <b>level</b> sets have been proposed. However, if some a priori information about the geometry of the level set is available, then excess mass algorithms can be useful. In this case, a density estimator is not necessary, {{and the problem of}} bandwidth selection can be avoided. The third methodology is a hybrid of the others. As in the excess mass method, it assumes a mild geometric restriction on the level set and, like the plug-in approach, requires a pilot nonparametric estimator of the density. One interesting open question concerns the practical performance of these methods. In this work, existing methods are reviewed, and two new hybrid algorithms are proposed. Their practical behaviour is compared through extensive simulations...|$|R

50|$|The first code <b>selectors</b> had <b>levels</b> {{for local}} {{exchange}} calls and {{calls to the}} local tandem exchange. An exchange with up to 23 outgoing routes would require a second code selection stage on some calls, and for more outgoing routes (up to 93) some third selection stages. But as a nearby business exchange might have 50 TU (traffic units) in the BH (busy hour), and more distant exchanges might have only 2 or 3 TUs, the busy routes {{should be on the}} first code selectors and the least busy routes only via a second and perhaps a third selection stage. Hence for a hypothetical example with 30 outgoing routes, three schemes are possible with (A) three second and no third code selector groups, (B) two second and one third code selector groups, and (C) one second and two third code selector groups. The number of switches for the hypothetical traffic distribution is 348, 302 and 315 switches, i.e. scheme B is the optimum; but each exchange must be calculated individually. The busy routes should also be allocated to the lower <b>levels</b> on the <b>selectors</b> to minimise setting-up time and also the number of operations of the mechanism and hence the wear on them.|$|R
40|$|A robust CE {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} {{determination of the}} enantiomers of ketamine and norketamine in equine plasma is described. It is based upon liquid-liquid extraction of ketamine and norketamine at alkaline pH from 1 mL plasma followed by analysis of the reconstituted extract by CE {{in the presence of}} a pH 2. 5 Tris-phosphate buffer containing 10 mg/mL highly sulfated beta-CD as chiral <b>selector.</b> Enantiomer plasma <b>levels</b> between 0. 04 and 2. 5 microg/mL are shown to provide linear calibration graphs. Intraday and interday precisions evaluated from peak area ratios (n = 5) at the lowest calibrator concentration are < 8 and < 14 %, respectively. The LOD for all enantiomers is 0. 01 microg/mL. After i. v. bolus administration of 2. 2 mg/kg racemic ketamine, the assay is demonstrated to provide reliable data for plasma samples of ponies under isoflurane anesthesia, of ponies premedicated with xylazine, and of one horse that received romifidine, L-methadone, guaifenisine, and isoflurane. In animals not premedicated with xylazine, the ketamine N-demethylation is demonstrated to be enantioselective. The concentrations of the two ketamine enantiomers in plasma are equal whereas S-norketamine is found in a larger amount than R-norketamine. In the group receiving xylazine, data obtained do not reveal this stereoselectivity...|$|R
50|$|Curran's {{performances}} at under-age levels {{brought him to}} the attentions of the Cork <b>selectors</b> at senior <b>level.</b> He made his senior championship debut in 2003, a year which saw Cork's players emerge from a bitter stand-off with the county board and reach the Munster final {{for the first time in}} three years. Waterford provided the opposition on that occasion as one of hurling's modern rivalries began in earnest. An exciting game resulted between the two teams; however, victory went to Cork by 3-16 to 3-12. It was Curran's first Munster winners' medal in the senior grade and it gave a signal that Cork were back. Cork were hot favourites going into the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final against Wexford, however, it was far from a walkover. In one of the most exciting games of the championship both sides finished level: Cork 2-20, Wexford 3-17. Both sides met again six days later with Cork making no mistake and taking the spoils on a score line of 3-17 to 2-7. This win set up an All-Ireland final meeting with Kilkenny. In another thrilling game of hurling both teams were level for much of the game, exchanging tit-for-tat scores. A Setanta Ó hAilpín goal steadied the Cork ship, however, a Martin Comerford goal five minutes from the end settled the game as Kilkenny went on to win by 1-14 to 1-11.|$|R
50|$|The Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} Talent Resource Development Scheme (TRDS)) was an {{initiative of the}} Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to spot local talent, looking beyond the established cricketing centres. The TRDW was established in 2002 with former India national captain Dilip Vengsarkar as its chairman, when Jagmohan Dalmiya was BCCI President. Many successful players of the Indian team, including World Cup winning captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Irfan Pathan, Sreesanth, RP Singh and Piyush Chawla were first recognised via the TRDW. Prior to this system, the local state cricket associations played the key role in choosing players for that state's team and recommending names to national <b>level</b> <b>selectors.</b> This led to frequent accusations of favouritism and corruption; charges that past players and state selectors would tend to belong to state capitals and urban centres, thus forming a closed club which small town players {{found it hard to}} break into. The TRDW was intended to allow talent to be discovered directly by the BCCI, and fast-tracked into being groomed for national team duty via the National Cricket Academy (NCA) and zonal academies. TRDW-selected players have {{played an important role in}} the Indian team's performances over the past few years, crowned by the unprecedented success of Mahendra Singh Dhoni as India's captain, and the 2011 Cricket World Cup victory.|$|R
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this project is the {{introduction}} of haptic feedback for touch screens in an in-vehicle environment. Due to the numerous studies on confirmation haptic feedback, this project regards navigation haptic feedback. The importance {{of this project}} is to {{provide an overview of}} this kind of haptic feedback. Also, to prove the ability of touch screens to assist drivers in the interaction with a multifunctional device in a driving situation. For this purpose, an introduction of the background was carried out, including touch screens, technologies producing haptic feedback, the sense of touch and users in a driving situation. From this, two conclusions were taken. First, the kind of touch screen that most suits an in-vehicle environment is a multicapacitive touch screen. Also, that the best technology to produce navigation haptic feedback is the texture surface changing. Taking these results into consideration a prototype was implemented. This prototype was tested in a usability study. The main problem found out during the usability study is the long learnability time needed by the participants due to the new way of interaction introduced to be able to navigate. From the information of the usability study the following results have been extracted. The actions that were helped by the introduction of navigation haptic feedback were navigation across items and <b>level</b> <b>selectors.</b> It has been shown that a standardized selection of haptic feedback is needed in order to reduce learnability time and introduce guessability in future touch screen devices. Some more studies, when looking upon different traffic situations must be carried out in order to understand if also theese conditions require the same amount of help introduced by navigation haptic feedback. An important result of this project is that none {{of the participants in the}} usability study turned off the optional haptic feedback, when this was included in their multifunctional in-vehicle device. This shown a trust on haptics that has to be seen as a motive to continue working on it...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{theories}} {{accounting for}} legal emergence offer important insights {{to add to}} orthodox jurisprudential debate. It is proposed {{that the nature of}} law can be more satisfactorily or comprehensively appreciated by incorporating an evolutionary perspective. This thesis uses the generic variation-selection-retention paradigm of Donald T Campbell as the conceptual framework for considering how the biological and cultural evolutionary processes add these valuable insights into the nature of the law. FA Hayek approved and adopted Campbells model to produce the thesis on legal evolution {{that is the subject of}} his works The Constitution of Liberty and Law Legislation and Liberty. Hayeks thesis is considered to be the most sophisticated and comprehensive analysis of the application of evolutionary theory to legal development. By investigating recent advances in the scientific disciplines of complex systems theory, evolutionary psychology and theories of cultural evolution in the context of a Hayekian-Campbellian framework this thesis aims to augment, consolidate and complement these early important works. This thesis updates Hayeks examination of society as a production of self-organised and spontaneously ordering behaviour by examining the growing literature applying the non-linear sciences of complexity theory and chaos theory to legal philosophy. Rules are a product of innate rule-following behaviour or attempts by people to coerce others into rule-abiding conduct. Many of these behaviours are explicable on a biologically-derived evolutionary basis or as an interplay of genetic predispositions with the cultural evolutionary process. Evolutionary psychology as a scientific rationale for human behaviours contributes significantly to an understanding of legally relevant behaviour in terms of genetic traits that have evolved to solve the adaptive challenges of the social environment. Rules and laws are items of cultural inheritance the survival of which may be understood in terms of cultural evolution or memetic theory. Explaining both biological traits and cultural products as the product of <b>selectors</b> at various <b>levels</b> of a nested hierarchy of vicarious selectors can reveal insights into the process of legal emergence. These insights may also inform questions of the usefulness and feasibility of different laws and legal approaches as well as providing a factual basis for a discussion of normative considerations...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityA {{study was}} {{previously}} made by Dr. Duncan E. Macdonald {{and his group}} at the Optical Research Laboratory of Boston University. This study dealt with the determination of photographic image quality by edge analysis, where an edge here was defined as B {{greater than or equal}} to ten percent occurring between a successive trough and peak of a micro-densitometer trace across the photograph. ∆ B is defined as the brightness change across the edge and B is the minimum absolute brightness where this change took place. This thesis is a further study into the work done by Dr. Macdonald. The analysis of his data was done from direct measurements of the paper recorded micro-densitometer traces, but in this study it was proposed that the same or similar data could be recorded automatically using electronic equipment. This thesis presupposes no quantitative definition of an edge, but suggests that with further work a quantitative definition of an edge may be determined. An edge is simply defined as the boundary which separates a picture element from its surroundings on a photograph so that the object is discernible to the eye. We assume that the quality of the picture is a function of its edges and that the edge can be described by two variables; 1) the slope or rate of change of brightness across the edge, and 2) the relative brightness difference across the edge. The equipment used was designed to measure the magnitude of the relative slope, and count the number of slopes of given magnitude in a unidirectional scan across the photograph. Other equipment was designed to measure the magnitude of the reflectivity difference across the edge and count the number of occurences for a given magnitude per linescan. An edge is defined electronically as the change in reflectivity from black to white of a uni-directional scan between any two points where the derivative of this linescan waveform is zero. In this definition no notice is taken as to whether an observer can detect the edge. Five aerial photographs were used in this study graded by impartial observers. Three of the photos are aerial photographs of trees graded as (A) unus~ble, (B) just usuable, (C) excellent. The other two pictures are aerial photos of the Boston suburban area graded as (P) unusable and (G) excellent. These photographs were mounted on a rotating drum which can be adjusted so that any part of the drum can be scanned. The drum was illuminated from a suitable light source. The target is imaged on a pinhole through an optical system. Behind the pinhole is a photo-multiplier tube. The output of the photo-tube serves as the input to a D. C. amplifier. The output of the amplifier is then a voltage scan of a line on the target. To work with the derivative of this waveform the voltage function is then differentiated and level selected. All derivatives above the level selected are counted on an electronic counter. By varying the <b>level</b> <b>selector</b> from zero to maximum level all derivatives are counted and magnitudes recorded. To get the reflectivity difference across an edge a circuit is used which allows an output of the linescan signal to appear only when the derivative is positive. Thus the reflectivity difference across an edge appears relative to a common base line irrespective of what background reflectivity the edge occurred. This in turn was electronically level selected and counted in the same manner as was the derivative. The data consisted of between 1, 500 and 2, 000 counts for every curve drawn. This data was reworked and presented in graphical form, as shown in figures XVII through XX, as cumulative frequency of counts plotted against the magnitude of the relative derivative of the edge in one case and the magnitude of relative reflectivity across an edge in the other. These curves show quite clearly that a difference exists between the good and poor pictures. The excellent photos have slopes that are much greater than the just usuable or unusable pictures. The higher magnitude slopes seem to indicate the quality of the photograph, the lower value slopes being fairly uniform throughout. Similarly the higher reflectivity across an edge appears on the best quality photographs with commensurate degrading for poorer quality pictures. With the knowledge that the edge criterion chosen can lead to objective results for picture quality, it would be interesting to carry on this work in experimentally determining a definition for the threshold photographic edge. This threshold edge is defined as the minimum observable boundary permitting a picture element to be seen in a photograph by a human observer. This could be done by using a large sample from photo-interpreters and the apparatus already perfected for this thesis...|$|R
