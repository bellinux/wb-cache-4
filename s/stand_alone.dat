5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, {{there was still}} a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision would be made after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. Not wanting to risk the series being cut off {{in the middle of a}} story, he designed the first six issues to <b>stand</b> <b>alone</b> if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page of issue six so he would be prepared either way.|$|E
5|$|Giving Jharokha Darshan {{from this}} jharokha was a daily feature. This {{tradition}} was also continued by rulers who followed Akbar (r. 1556–1605 CE). Jahangir (r. 1605–27 CE) and Shah Jahan (r. 1628–58 CE) also appeared before their subjects punctiliously. However, this ancient practice was discontinued by Aurangzeb during his 11th year of reign as he {{considered it a}} non-Islamic practice, a form of idol worship. In Agra Fort and Red Fort, the jharokha faces the Yamuna and the emperor would <b>stand</b> <b>alone</b> on the jharokha to greet his subjects.|$|E
5|$|Robyn Miller {{composed}} Rivens music, {{which was}} later packaged and released by Virgin Records as Riven: The Soundtrack. Miller designed the liner notes and packaging, which included English translations {{of the language}} found in the game.

The compact disc was released on February 24, 1998, with 54minutes of music.|$|E

The educational theories incorporated were disguised with music and entertainment, with the band's work being designed to have multiple layers and cater {{for a wide range of}} ages in the audience, while being primarily aimed at those aged 2–8. Harris explained that Hi-5 was primarily a television series, but the music itself had the ability to <b>stand</b> <b>alone.</b> She expected that the series would initially become formatted into international versions, however was so confident with the original cast that the Australian series was sold overseas instead.|$|E

The stereoscopic 3D version was released in both normal and deluxe edition on July 22, 2011.

5|$|Possessive pronouns {{exist in}} {{dependent}} and independent forms; the dependent form {{functions as a}} determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can <b>stand</b> <b>alone</b> {{as if it were}} a noun (e.g. the chair is mine). The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse and ye found in Irish English.|$|E

5|$|The sitters are {{presented}} in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo {{and in many ways}} counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially {{the manner in which the}} folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to <b>stand</b> <b>alone,</b> given that Barbara's was painted some time later.|$|E
5|$|The {{unexpected}} {{success of}} her first book, No Logo (1999), extended author and journalist Naomi Klein's book tour beyond its original two-week schedule. She spent the next 30 months traveling the world promoting the book as well as writing newspaper articles covering the anti-globalization movement. Most of her articles were originally published in the Canadian national newspaper The Globe and Mail, while some were published by The Nation, The New York Times, and The Guardian. During this time she resisted her publisher's urgings to write a new book, and the pressure to match No Logos success was bearing down upon her. She relented to the pressure for another publication by collecting {{the best of the}} articles and speeches she had written since No Logo. She did not intend this new book to be a sequel or follow-up, but rather a <b>stand</b> <b>alone</b> collection of writing.|$|E
5|$|Two manga adaptations were {{published}} by ASCII Media Works in Dengeki Daioh and Dengeki Maoh. Between 2005 and 2012, {{the series was}} adapted by J.C.Staff into three 24-episode anime television series, a four-episode original video animation (OVA) series, an animated film and an additional <b>stand</b> <b>alone</b> OVA episode. A PlayStation 2 video game was released in March 2006, and it was ported to the Nintendo DS in March 2007. Viz Media licensed the novels and the first manga series for release in North America, but stopped publishing both prematurely. Geneon originally licensed the first television series for release in North America, but the license later transferred to Funimation, who also licensed the remaining anime properties. Critics praised the series for its execution of typical story elements and how it continuously becomes better over time. However, the series is described as having issues with pacing.|$|E

25|$|The inflected {{form of a}} word often {{contains}} both one or {{more free}} morphemes (a unit of meaning which can stand by itself as a word), and one or more bound morphemes (a unit of meaning which cannot <b>stand</b> <b>alone</b> as a word). For example, the English word cars is a noun that is inflected for number, specifically to express the plural; the content morpheme car is unbound because it could <b>stand</b> <b>alone</b> as a word, while the suffix -s is bound because it cannot <b>stand</b> <b>alone</b> as a word. These two morphemes together form the inflected word cars.|$|E
