And he rose up, and tired as he was he went in at the door, of and although it was night time outside, it was daylight he found within. And presently he met with an old man that had been gathering summer thyme and yellow flag-flowers, and it seemed as if all the <b>sweet</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> the summer were with them.

60|$|Sometimes a whole {{afternoon}} {{would go}} slowly by, {{filled with the}} sounds and <b>sweet</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> the woods, and not a ripple would break the dimples of the stream before me. But when, one late afternoon, just as the pines across the stream began to darken against the western light, a string of silver bubbles shot across the stream and a big otter rose to the surface with a pickerel in his mouth, all the watching that had not well repaid itself was swept out of the reckoning. He came swiftly towards me, put his fore paws against the bank, gave a wriggling jump,--and there he was, not twenty feet away, holding the pickerel down with his fore paws, his back arched like a frightened cat, and a tiny stream of water trickling down {{from the tip of}} his heavy pointed tail, as he ate his fish with immense relish.|$|R
60|$|It {{was rather}} hot, but Jessie did enjoy the lanes, with their flowery banks, and the <b>sweet</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> the hay, {{and she felt}} much brightened and refreshed. When she came near the house, she saw some one sitting in a basket-chair in the porch, and {{knew that it was}} Miss Needwood, a poor, sickly orphan {{relation}} of Mrs. Drew's, who was always trying situations as nursery governess, or reader, or the like, and leaving them because her health would not serve; and then she had no home to go to but Chalk-pit Farm. She was not so much above the Hollises as the farmer's own family, and was always friendly with them. She came to meet Jessie, shook hands with her, and explained that Mrs. Drew had been summoned to speak about some poultry, but would return in a moment if Miss Hollis would sit down.|$|R

500|$|Faced with {{potential}} unemployment {{from the sale}} of Ealing Studios to the BBC in 1954, director Alexander Mackendrick began entertaining offers from Hollywood. He rejected potential contracts from [...] Cary Grant and David Selznick and signed with independent production company Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, enticed by their offer to adapt George Bernard Shaw’s play The Devil's Disciple. After the project collapsed during pre-production, Mackendrick asked to be released from his commitment. Harold Hecht refused and asked him to start work on another project – adapting Ernest Lehman’s novellette <b>Sweet</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>of</b> Success into a film.|$|E
500|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>of</b> Success holds a 98 percent [...] "fresh" [...] rating {{based on}} 45 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes and a 100 metascore rating based on 5 reviews at Metacritic. Though Mackendrick's {{direction}} of the actors and his staging of the scenes are at times extraordinary, in recent years critics have praised only the film's dialogue, [...] "courtesy of Ernest Lehman and Clifford Odets, a high-toned street vernacular that no real New Yorker has ever spoken but that every real New Yorker wishes he could", A. O. Scott wrote ...|$|E
500|$|Hecht-Hill-Lancaster allowed Mackendrick to {{familiarize}} himself with New York City before shooting the movie. In Notes on <b>Sweet</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>of</b> Success, Mackendrick said, [...] "One of the characteristic aspects of New York, particularly {{of the area}} between 42nd Street and 57th Street, is the neurotic energy of the crowded sidewalks. This was, I argued, essential {{to the story of}} characters driven by the uglier aspects of ambition and greed". He took multiple photographs of the city from several fixed points and taped the pictures into a series of panoramas that he stuck on a wall and studied once he got back to Hollywood.|$|E
50|$|Quaqua {{flowers are}} {{distinctive}} {{from those of}} other southern African stapeliads for their numerous inflorescences emerging from each stem, especially closer to the ends. There are often ten along each stem, vertically arranged in distichous series. The flowers of some species are <b>sweet</b> <b>smelling</b> (faintly <b>of</b> honey or lemon), attractive and rather small (between 7 and 15 mm in diameter). The flowers of other species however, are larger, reaching a maximum diameter of 27 mm and are dark, papillate, and usually have a repulsive odor of urine or excrement. These species are pollinated by flies.|$|R
5000|$|Puṇḍarika Viṭṭhala {{describes}} as follows:" [...] The king at war always worship Maravi, whose face shines like {{the moon and}} who has long tresses of hair.

Her complexion gleams like gold; she is attired in red and her eyes are {{like those of a}} fawn. She is the elder sister of Mewar. In Marwa Ni and Ga are sharp, SA is the graha and amsa and Ri and Dha are the nyasa".|$|R
60|$|The girls walked silently {{down the}} red, twilit road. The robins were singing vespers {{in the high}} treetops, filling the golden air with their jubilant voices. The silver fluting of the frogs came from marshes and ponds, over fields where seeds were {{beginning}} to stir with life and thrill to the sunshine and rain that had drifted over them. The air was fragrant with the wild, <b>sweet,</b> wholesome <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> young raspberry copses. White mists were hovering in the silent hollows and violet stars were shining bluely on the brooklands.|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} low- and modestly-budgeted noirs {{were made by}} independent, often actor-owned, {{companies}} contracting with larger studios for distribution. Serving as producer, writer, director and top-billed performer, Hugo Haas made films like Pickup (1951) and The Other Woman (1954). It was in this way that accomplished noir actress Ida Lupino established herself as the sole female director in Hollywood during the late 1940s {{and much of the}} 1950s. She does not appear in the best-known film she directed, The Hitch-Hiker (1953), developed by her company, The Filmakers, with support and distribution by RKO. It is one of the seven classic film noirs produced largely outside of the major studios that have been chosen for the United States National Film Registry. Of the others, one was a small-studio release: [...] Detour. Four were independent productions distributed by United Artists, the [...] "studio without a studio": Gun Crazy; Kiss Me Deadly; D.O.A. (1950), directed by Rudolph Maté and <b>Sweet</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>of</b> Success (1957), directed by Alexander Mackendrick. One was an independent distributed by MGM, the industry leader: Force of Evil (1948), directed by Abraham Polonsky and starring John Garfield, both of whom were blacklisted in the 1950s. Independent production usually meant restricted circumstances but <b>Sweet</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>of</b> Success, despite the plans of the production team, was clearly not made on the cheap, though like many other cherished A-budget noirs, it might be said to have a B-movie soul.|$|E
500|$|During {{his life}} in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien {{received}} steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. In 1961, his friend C. S. Lewis even nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature. The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted {{that he had not}} chosen early retirement. At first, he wrote enthusiastic answers to readers' enquiries, but he became increasingly unhappy about the sudden popularity of his books with the 1960s counter-culture movement. In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a cult-figure, but admitted that [...] "even the nose of a very modest idol ... cannot remain entirely untickled by the <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> incense!" ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>of</b> Success premiered in New York at Loew’s State in Times Square on June 27, 1957. Critical {{reaction}} {{was much more}} favorable. Time said that the movie was [...] "raised to considerable dramatic heights by intense acting, taut direction ... superb camera work ... and, above all, by its whiplash dialogue". Both it and the New York Herald included the film on their ten-best lists for 1957. The film's reputation improved over time, with David Denby in New York magazine calling it [...] "the most acrid, and the best" [...] of all New York movies because it captured, [...] "better than any film I know the atmosphere of Times Square and big-city journalism".|$|E
5000|$|Ropes made of Hardwickia and Coconut {{were used}} to capture Elephants in ancient times, {{according}} to the encyclopedic work Manasollasa or Abhilashitarthachintamani.This encyclopedia has been ascribed to the Western Chalukya King, Someshvara III, who ruled in the twelfth century AD.Sangam poets have mentioned and described Hardwickia as yaa. According to Sangam Literature the elephants are fond of the bark and <b>sweet</b> <b>smelling</b> oil <b>of</b> Hardwickia. Hardwickia ( [...] Anajan in Sanskrit,Aacha in Tamil/Malayalam [...] ) is also mentioned in Sundara Kaandam of Valmiki Ramyana/Kamba Ramayana {{as one of the}} trees in Asokavanam where Sitadevi was kept in captivity under a Simpsupa (amherstia nobilis) Tree by the demon king Ravana.|$|R
50|$|The cap is 3 - 7.5 cm {{wide and}} white with a pale yellow tinge, and more yellow or ochre in the centre as the fruit body ages.

500|$|Dicoumarol was {{a product}} of the plant {{molecule}} coumarin (not to be confused with Coumadin, a later tradename for warfarin). Coumarin is now known to be present in many plants, and produces the notably <b>sweet</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> freshly cut grass or hay and plants like sweet grass; in fact, the plant's high content of coumarin is responsible for the original common name of [...] "sweet clover", which is named for its sweet smell, not its bitter taste. They are present notably in woodruff (Galium odoratum, Rubiaceae), and at lower levels in licorice, lavender, and various other species. However, coumarins themselves do not influence clotting or warfarin-like action, but must first be metabolized by various fungi into compounds such as 4-hydroxycoumarin, then further (in the presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde) into dicoumarol, in order to have any anticoagulant properties. Fungal attack of the damaged and dying clover stalks explained the presence of the anticoagulant only in spoiled clover silages; dicoumarol {{is considered to be a}} fermentation product and mycotoxin.|$|E
500|$|A preview {{screening}} of <b>Sweet</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>of</b> Success was poorly received, as Tony Curtis fans were {{expecting him to}} play one of his typical nice guy roles and instead were presented with the scheming Sidney Falco. Mackendrick remembered seeing audience members [...] "curling up, crossing their arms and legs, recoiling from the screen in disgust". Burt Lancaster's fans were not thrilled with their idol either, [...] "finding the film too static and talky". The film was a box office failure, and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill. [...] "The night of the preview, Harold said to me, 'You know you've wrecked our company? We're going to lose {{over a million dollars}} on this picture,'" [...] Hill recalled. However, Lancaster blamed Lehman, who remembers a confrontation they had: [...] "Burt threatened me at a party after the preview. He said, 'You didn't have to leave – you could have made this a much better picture. I ought to beat you up.' I said, 'Go ahead – I could use the money.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{score was}} composed, {{arranged}} and conducted by Elmer Bernstein, but the picture also featured jazz themes {{performed by the}} Chico Hamilton Quintet, and two soundtrack albums were released on the Decca label in 1958. Allmusic's Blair Sanderson noted, [...] "The soundtrack to Alexander Mackendrick's 1957 motion picture <b>Sweet</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>of</b> Success combines orchestral music by the versatile Elmer Bernstein and modern jazz by the Chico Hamilton Quintet, including numbers performed in the film's club scenes. Both provide a moody backdrop to the cynical showbiz drama and intersect at several key points {{through the use of}} a common theme, the tune 'Goodbye Baby'. ... For his part, Bernstein employs richly dissonant big band sonorities and nocturnal urban blues in his score, and much of his music has the hard-edged, gritty sound that was associated with big city life in the 1950s. Hamilton's exploratory improvisations and Bernstein's studio orchestrations make this a highly sophisticated film score". In The Guardian, John L. Walters called the soundtrack [...] "the sonic equivalent of a well-mixed Manhattan: seven cool cues by drummer Chico Hamilton's adventurous band, and 14 orchestral blasts by Elmer Bernstein".|$|E
5000|$|Amongst the claimed {{advantages}} of Bio-Blends biodiesel {{is that it}} has a <b>sweeter</b> <b>smell</b> than regular biodiesel. The product <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> bacon, unlike regular biodiesel, described by one reviewer, as <b>smelling</b> <b>of</b> [...] "rancid popcorn".|$|R
5000|$|... "Chekhov did {{not like}} cut flowers. He loved and knew flowers like a real gardener. Not having his own children, he treated each flower as his child." [...] His {{favorite}} flowers were Moscow peonies which were planted along the paths, but he also planted heliotrope, delfinium, chrysanthemums, aster. jonquils, and many other flowers. The aromas of his garden even entered into the plays he wrote at Melikhovo: in The Seagull, the writer Trigorin says, [...] "When I smell heliotropes; I take a mental note; an excessively <b>sweet</b> <b>smell,</b> the color <b>of</b> widows. something I can use describing a summer night.".|$|R
5000|$|Kuaitiao Sukhothai (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวสุโขทัย, [...] "Sukhothai rice noodles") is a {{style of}} rice noodle soup (kuai tiao) served in Thailand. It {{consists}} of rice noodles with stock and toppings, combining rice noodle which almost served with thin type of noodle called “sen lek”. Sliced pork or sweet pork-based broth, ground pork and crackling are almost based on topping. Thin sliced green beans, small pieces of salted turnip, ground peanut are the main ingredients. The taste is based on <b>sweet</b> mellow and <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> lime, dressing with fish sauce and ground chili. Kuaytiaw sukhothai is popular served two types: dry or with soup.|$|R
