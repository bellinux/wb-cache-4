40|$|The {{measures}} of price image {{proposed by the}} literature are mostly multidimensional and fail to consider the richness of this concept. This study proposes a measure of price image. An exploratory and qualitative study helped generate a pool of items. Then the obtained list has been subject to a questionnaire-based survey {{in order to determine}} the dimensions that would better conceptualise price image in the context of purchasing cosmetic products and perfumes. Three dimensions have been identified: the dimensions of “price security”, “proposed brand” and “value”. These dimensions have been then compared to unveil the difference between a <b>specialised</b> <b>store</b> price image and a non-specialised store price image. A mean difference test is conducted to attest for the hypothesis that a non-specialised store price image is evaluated more positively than a <b>specialised</b> <b>store</b> price image. Our study is nonetheless limited. The implications and limitations of our study open up new research venues worth exploring...|$|E

50|$|Systematic whaling was not {{possible}} in Iceland until the late 19th century, {{due to the lack}} of ocean-going ships. Small whales were hunted close to the shore with the small rowboats used for fishing. Beached whales were also eaten. The Icelandic word for beached whale, hvalreki, is still used to mean a stroke of good luck. When Iceland started commercial whaling (mostly minke whales) in the early 20th century, whale meat became popular as a low-priced red meat. It can be prepared in much the same manner as the more expensive beef. When Iceland withdrew from the International Whaling Commission in 1992, commercial whaling stopped. Some whale meat was still sold in <b>specialised</b> <b>stores,</b> coming from small whales that had beached or been accidentally caught in nets. In 2002 Iceland rejoined the IWC, and commercial whaling recommenced in 2006. Whale meat is commonly available again, although the price has gone up due to the cost of whaling.|$|R
5000|$|Snake soup (Cantonese: 蛇羹, Pinyin: she geng) is {{a popular}} Cantonese {{delicacy}} and health supplement in Hong Kong, which contains the meats {{of at least two}} types of snakes as the main ingredients. The soup tastes slightly sweet because of the addition of chrysanthemum leaves and spices, while the snake meat in the soup is said to resemble the texture and taste of chicken meat.Snake soup is usually served in <b>specialised</b> <b>stores</b> known as [...] "Snake King" [...] or [...] "Shea Wang" [...] (literal meaning: an expert in cooking snakes), mostly located in Shum Shui Po and Kowloon City, in fall or winter season for approximately $60 HKD ($7.75 USD) per bowl.Originated centuries ago during the Era of Warring States, snake soup has been lauded in Chinese culture for its alleged medicinal benefits and high nutritional value. However, there are concerns in recent years that the snake soup industry in Hong Kong is on the decline because soup makers have few people to pass on their skills.|$|R
40|$|For {{years the}} Institute of Marketing at Szent IstvÃ¡n University has been {{conducting}} research in customer and consumer behaviour. This research project focuses on which food shops retail customers choose {{when it comes to}} traditional food. This paper briefly summarizes qualitative findings and offers a preliminary analysis of the project’s quantitative stage. Using six focus groups, the qualitative phase tried to identify factors that impact on how food retail shops were chosen. The goal was to pinpoint individual steps in the decision-making process. Shops selected for study were: hypermarkets, supermarkets, discount stores, small shops, markets, <b>specialised</b> <b>stores</b> and cash & carry stores. Following this, using data from the qualitative results, a national representative survey was conducted. The survey used a standardised questionnaire with 1, 019 subjects. The survey concentrated on hypermarket customers, as well as identifying this customer group’s segments, and analysing their decision-making traits.

40|$|Retail {{purchasing}} groups {{consist of}} small, independent, <b>specialised</b> <b>stores</b> that join together and collaborate on purchasing and other areas. In comparison to large-scale corporate retail chains, often labelled mega-retailers, retail purchasing groups {{are based on}} collaborative external integration between a central unit and the independent, local dealers. The overall purpose {{of this research is}} to explore the specific characteristics that underscore a retail purchasing group. The paper has two research questions: (1) What are {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} a supply chain structure based on external integration?, and (2) In what areas is the purchasing groups’ ownership structure particularly advantageous in comparison to the mega-retailers’ vertically integrated organisations? This exploratory research is empirically grounded in a case study of two Swedish purchasing groups. The paper argues that under certain market conditions, a decentralised supply chain, which relies on collaborative external relationships, can provide a competitive alternative to a more traditional centralised structure.   The paper elaborate three areas where the structure is particularly advantageous: (1) service-based competition in an industry otherwise focused on cost leadership, (2) in-depth understanding of local conditions and presence, and (3) the ability to incorporate entrepreneurial strengths and innovations in the supply chain...|$|R
