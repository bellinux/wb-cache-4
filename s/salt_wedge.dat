40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the temperature, salinity, turbidity, and light attenuation characteristics throughout the Great Bay Estuary System during 1974 - 1978. In contrast to previous studies within the Estuary (Norall and Mathieson, 1976, Daly and Mathieson, in preparation) only physical parameters were measured and they were measured at more frequent (1 meter) vertical intervals. Such information is important to future coastal zone management and to ultimate understanding of the estuarine ecosystem. The Great Bay Estuary System is a dynamic habitat with pronounced spatial and temporal variations of hydrographic factors. Accordingly, locations furthest from the coast experience the most freshwater influence and the least oceanic influence. In some sites there are 2 ̆ 2 <b>salt</b> <b>wedges</b> 2 ̆ 2 resulting in physical variability with depth. Seasonality is apparent in the amount of freshwater input, detrital input, and temperature variation. The volume of freshwater entering the Estuary is greatest during spring runoff when precipitation is low and evaporation high. As the volume of water in the Estuary changes tidal currents, the amount of fresh water input may affect turbidity and light attenuation, as well as salinity. The present study evaluates three sources of physical variation in the Estuary: 1) location, 2) season, and 3) depth.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} which {{control the}} spread of tracers in the N. W. European Shelf Seas are reviewed. The perspective of this review is to allow a comparison with the vastly different regimes found in Australian waters. Whilst these N. W. European Shelf Seas are dominated by {{the influence of the}} M 2 semi-diurnal tide, the Gulfs off South Australia have significant diurnal constitutents and a peculiar near equality of M 2 and S 2 -producing 'dodge' tides. Nevertheless, generalised expressions for both the annual mean and the seasonal amplitude of sea surface temperature (derived from North Atlantic data) are generally applicable. The greater sensitivity of diurnal tidal constituents to bed friction coupled with the proximity to the related inertial latitude suggests that tidal propagation models may require more tuning of the bed stress coefficient. However the greatest contrast is for 'estuaries' where the excess of evaporation over precipitation and river flow produces 'inverse estuaries' unknown in Europe. Whilst flushing time concepts can be used in similar fashions, the extraction of tracers from such estuaries occurs close to the bed via 'inverse' <b>salt</b> <b>wedges.</b> This contrast with mean surface extraction in European estuaries will have significant influences on the related ecology.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been carryout to {{highlight}} the scientific community {{about the importance of}} coastal beach-dune system in coastal dynamics recognizing. Their ecological and environmental value is very important, they play a fundamental rule in coastal defense protecting hinterland from flooding with their raised morphology, contrasting the <b>salt</b> <b>wedge’s</b> intrusion with their water table and moreover they constitute an important reservoir of sand for beaches This aspect in the Emilia-Romagna region seems to be particularly important: many coastline features are characterized by emergency conditions because they are exposed more frequently and dangerously to phenomena of submersions for sea storm’s events and to a diffuse and intense marine erosion. Actually, along 130 km of the Emilia-Romagna coastline, 29 km are characterized by the presence of coastal dunes, of which, approximately 9, 5 km belong to the province of Ferrara, approximately 18 km to Ravenna’s and remaining to the more to south coastal part of the region. In this paper the results of a regional research are presented trough the application of a methodological integrated approach (System’s Theory), that aims to analyze and to point out the evident morphoevolutionary state of crisis in which the Emilia Romagna dunes today are (2008). Another objective is to try to optimize the management’s policies of natural sedimentary resources, which are today very important for the new philosophical approaches to coastal problems. The final result is a tool able to supply indications about the priorities to front and the actions methodologies finalized to the safeguard and the defense of these delicate environmental subsystems. It becomes fundamental to have the correct perception of the phenomena in action and to quantify the “weight” that the several morphodynamic’s agents have in the coastal dune system’s evolution. The parameterization of such factors, the spatial analysis, the multi-scale and temporal analysis (from 2000 to today) helps us to identify the relations of mutual interaction between such parameters. Therefore, it’s possible to extract an Instability beach-Dune system Index (IDI) to establish the state of system’s instability, and a space-temporal variability allowing their possible future evolution forecasting. Among all the factors, the anthropic impact of the several tourist activities on the management of coastal spaces, in the Emilia Romagna region seems to be the most important: only for the province of Ferrara, for example, from 2000 to today, the areas lacking in vegetation developed on dunes, have increased of approximately 11...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Due to {{decreasing}} precipitation {{in recent}} years, lack of perennial surface water resources, {{and the high}} volume of groundwater extraction {{in the vicinity of}} Tashk Lake (called Tavabe-e-Arsanjan), the groundwater level decreases, and as a result, salt water from Tashk Lake intrudes into the fresh groundwater coastal aquifers. Several technical countermeasures are used to prevent or retard the groundwater salinization process. One of them is to increase (artificial) recharge in upland areas to enlarge the outflow of fresh groundwater through the coastal aquifer, and thus, to reduce the length of the <b>salt</b> water <b>wedge.</b> In this research, the natural recharge of groundwater is studied using the Cumulative Rainfall Departure (CRD) method with regards to the existing information in the study area. This study focuses on using both revised CRD (R-CRD) and CRD methods to simulate, and consequently predict, transient water table fluctuations. A user-friendly program named GREM, which is written in Visual Basic language, is used to minimize the difference between simulated and observed water table elevations. The simulated water table exhibits good agreement with the observed water table (modeling efficiency = 0. 933). The percentage of the cumulative rainfall departure (r), which results in a recharge from precipitation, is estimated to be 33. 6.

The current distribution of fresh and “saline” groundwater at depthis the result mostly of processes occurring at geological timescales - seawater intrusion processes followed byfresh groundwater flushing -, and slightly of recent anthropogenic activities. In this abstract, we focus on seawaterintrusion mechanisms in continental aquifers to investigate how saline fluids are irreversibly introduced intoaquifers after a full transgression cycle. We first show that most of salt water that remains {{after the end of}} a marinetransgression comes from a destabilization of the <b>salt</b> water <b>wedge.</b> This mainly occurs by gravity instabilities,which develop from salinized rivers or estuaries that penetrate inland on top of fresh groundwater.

Salinizationhas been quantified according to the width of the stream, the properties of the initial perturbation (amplitude andwavelength), the stream salinity and the regional groundwater flow. Simulations allow us to identify the conditionsnecessary to develop gravity instabilities, and if it does, the rates at which basement aquifers are salinized.

These measurements {{are the first}} to elucidate the processes influencing the along-channel current structure and the excursion of the <b>salt</b> <b>wedge</b> in this estuary. The <b>salt</b> <b>wedge</b> structure remained stable throughout the measuring period. The velocity measurements indicate decoupling effects between the layers and that bed-generated turbulence is confined below the pycnocline. The barotropic M 4 overtide structure is imposed {{at the mouth of the}} estuary, and the generation of M 4 overtides within the estuary is found to be relatively small. Internal tidal asymmetry does not make a significant contribution to the M 4 velocity frequency band. Instead, the combination of barotropic and baroclinic forcing, in conjunction with the suppression of turbulence at the interface, provides the main explanation for the time dependence and mean structure of the flow in the Rotterdam Waterway. This gives rise to the observed differences in the length of the flood and ebb, in the magnitudes of the flood and ebb velocities, in the length of the slack water periods, and in the timing of the onset of slack water at the surface and near the bed. It results in the formation of distinct exchange flow profiles at the head of the <b>salt</b> <b>wedge</b> around slack water and the creation of maximal velocities at the pycnocline during flood. Advection governs the displacement and structure of the <b>salt</b> <b>wedge</b> since turbulent mixing is suppressed.

In this study we apply a numerical model to understand how <b>salt</b> <b>wedge</b> dynamics, changes in river flow and temperature together control oxygen depletion in a micro-tidal riverine estuary, the Yarra River estuary, Australia. Coupled physical–biogeochemical models have been previously applied to study how hydrodynamics impact upon seasonal hypoxia; however, their application to relatively shallow, narrow riverine estuaries with highly transient patterns of river inputs and sporadic periods of oxygen depletion has remained challenging, largely due to difficulty in accurately simulating <b>salt</b> <b>wedge</b> dynamics in morphologically complex areas. In this study we overcome this issue through application of a flexible mesh 3 -D hydrodynamic–biogeochemical model in order to predict the extent of <b>salt</b> <b>wedge</b> intrusion and consequent patterns of oxygen depletion. The extent of the <b>salt</b> <b>wedge</b> responded quickly to the sporadic riverine flows, with the strength of stratification and vertical density gradients heavily influenced by morphological features corresponding to shallow points in regions of tight curvature ("horseshoe" bends). The spatiotemporal patterns of stratification led to the emergence of two "hot spots" of anoxia, the first downstream of a shallow region of tight curvature and the second downstream of a sill. Whilst these areas corresponded to regions of intense stratification, it was found that antecedent conditions related to the placement of the <b>salt</b> <b>wedge</b> {{played a major role in}} the recovery of anoxic regions following episodic high flow events. Furthermore, whilst a threshold <b>salt</b> <b>wedge</b> intrusion was a requirement for oxygen depletion, analysis of the results allowed us to quantify the effect of temperature in determining the overall severity and extent of hypoxia and anoxia. Climate warming scenarios highlighted that oxygen depletion is likely to be exacerbated through changes in flow regimes and warming temperatures; however, the increasing risk of hypoxia and anoxia can be mitigated through management of minimum flow allocations and targeted reductions in organic matter loading.

Of most concern are increased nitrogen inputs to coastal estuaries from fertiliser use, stormwater runoff and subsurface septic deposits. Thus, {{there is a need to}} identify, monitor and, where possible, remediate both point and non-point sources of nutrient pollution. Lake Illawarra, located on the South Coast of New South Wales is a barrier lagoon which has been experiencing macro algal blooms for many years associated with eutrophication. This study is a continuation of a number of groundwater quality assessments that have been conducted in the Windang Peninsula over the past two decades. The main objective of this preliminary study was to identify the north-south, east-west extent of ammonia in the unconfined aquifer of the Windang Peninsula. Three boreholes (4 m, 8 m and 12 m) were sunk at each of the four monitoring locations in the Windang Sandy Aquifer to identify ammonia trends with depth. Nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and TKN were sampled to show the species of nitrogen present in the aquifer. A dry period and rain event sample rounds have identified the presence of ammonia concentrations well above ANZECC guidelines for the 12 m bores. The dry period sample round and the rain event sample round identified maximum ammonia concentrations of 71. 0 mg/L and 73. 3 mg/L respectively. Nitrate and nitrite concentrations were quite low with maximum concentrations for both rounds of 0. 59 mg/L and 0. 01 mg/L respectively. Analysis for heavy metals showed that soluble iron is present at a maximum of 9. 1 mg/L. Cadmium, lead and copper were either close to or below the detectable limit whilst zinc was detected below ANZECC guidelines. The 12 m holes were cored for the reconstruction of the Windang Barrier Holocene evolution. Amino acid racemisation was used to date A. trapezia found in the core samples. The evolution of the Windang Barrier is consistent with similar studies of Holocene evolution of Lake Illawarra. The monitoring location along the lake’s edge suggests that tidally driven, circulating estuarine water is responsible for a subterranean mixing zone. It has been hypothesized that this zone is responsible for significant attenuation of the plume. Concentrations of ammonia in the <b>salt</b> water <b>wedge</b> are above natural levels in the lake and this suggests that advection of ammonia across the subterranean estuary is likely. Regular monitoring on a monthly basis and directly after a rainfall event is recommended to validate temporal and seasonal trends of the ammonia plume...|$|R
