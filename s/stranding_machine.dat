40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} we design an {{automatic}} changeover system for unwinding coils in copper wires <b>stranding</b> <b>machines</b> for energy cables. The system {{is illustrated by}} means of a case study: the stranding department at one of the plants of Pirelli Cables & Systems, the leader manufacturer in the field in Italy. Motivations for the study are increase in production, improvement in manpower utilization and decrease in waste material. Two alternative changeover algorithms are proposed and highlighted by means of simulations. Additionally, three different technical solutions are suggested, with several recommendations for implementations. Finally, a performance evaluation is carried out, investigating the impact of the study on the plant. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper brings {{together}} two <b>strands</b> of <b>machine</b> learning of increasing importance: kernel methods and highly structured data. We propose a general method for constructing a kernel following the syntactic {{structure of the}} data, as defined by its type signature in a higher-order logic. Our main theoretical result is the positive definiteness of any kernel thus defined. We report encouraging experimental results {{on a range of}} real-world data sets. By converting our kernel to a distance pseudo-metric for 1 -nearest neighbour, we were able to improve the best accuracy from the literature on the Diterpene data set by more than 10 %...|$|R

The numbers, length, twist, {{rotation direction}} {{and speed of}} the double strand silk it manufactured can be changed according to the engineer need. The end of strand silk it’s produced has a ring which can avoid split, which resolve the traditional silk end split problem...|$|R
50|$|In 1963, a {{full size}} single <b>strand,</b> {{vertical}} casting <b>machine</b> {{was added to}} the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.|$|R
40|$|Although {{quantitative}} analysis of metal alloys is typically accomplished by wet-chemical techniques, complete dissolution of some metal alloys can be difficult. Here, we report an alternative non-destructive energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) method for determination of nickel, gold, copper, and silver in metal alloy wires. Sample preparation {{is simple and}} consists of mounting wires as a single <b>strand</b> in <b>machined</b> polyethylene sample cups. Wires are analyzed in two symmetrical positions nearly parallel to the x-ray beam, thereby improving the external reproducibility of the analysis. Ideally, standards and samples are matched in terms of chemical composition and diameter. For 50 mil copper-silver wire, four certified reference wires consisting of various copper-silver compositions and matching the unknown diameter were used. However, we also investigated standards of different elemental composition and thickness. For analysis of 25 mil nickel-gold wires, 20 mil NIST standard wires consisting of copper-gold were applied for standardization and compared with certified 25 mil nickel-gold standards. Variations in wire diameter were corrected using an infinite thickness approximation, and nickel intensities were calculated from the copper intensities using...|$|R
40|$|Problems in {{continuous}} {{casting of steel}} are numerous and have been leading producers to find ever more efficient solutions. Wa have developed a thermomechanical model of continuous casting, using a non-linear finite element code. Since a complete 3 D discretization seemed impossible, the model {{has been based on}} a generalized plane strain state (2 D 1 / 2) and it includes at the same time thermal exchanges, mechanical behaviour of steel at very high temperature, the ferrostatic pressure and contact between the <b>strand</b> and the <b>machine.</b> This paper presents some results of two industrial applications. First results tend to prove the importance of some process factors (such as the mould taper) and local defects of the machine on the quality of cast products, according with observations.

40|$|Granulators {{are widely}} used to reduce {{reinforced}} and unreinforced plastic strands in small pieces. The tools implemented in this machining process are mainly made of high-speed steel. This work investigates diverse PVD hard thin coatings {{with the aim of}} improving tool life and efficiency in granulation technology. A test facility reproducing the main features of a real granulator has been designed and assembled. The <b>machined</b> <b>strand</b> materials are ABS plastic and fibreglass-reinforced polyamide 6, while the tested PVD films are CrN, TiCN, TiAlN and two different diamond-like carbon coatings. The wear evaluation of all coated tools has been done via structured light projection, together with a scanning electron microscopy-based analysis, before and after their implementation on the test facility. Furthermore, a suitable 2 D finite element modelling of the machining process has been realized...|$|R
50|$|Two or more wires may {{be wrapped}} concentrically, {{separated}} by insulation, to form coaxial cable. The wire or cable may be further protected with substances like paraffin, {{some kind of}} preservative compound, bitumen, lead, aluminum sheathing, or steel taping. <b>Stranding</b> or covering <b>machines</b> wind material onto wire which passes through quickly. Some of the smallest machines for cotton covering have a large drum, which grips the wire and moves it through toothed gears; the wire passes through the centre of disks mounted above a long bed, and the disks carry each a number of bobbins varying from six to twelve or more in different machines. A supply of covering material is wound on each bobbin, and the end is led on to the wire, which occupies a central position relatively to the bobbins; the latter being revolved at a suitable speed bodily with their disks, the cotton is consequently served on to the wire, winding in spiral fashion so as to overlap. If {{a large number of}} strands are required the disks are duplicated, so that as many as sixty spools may be carried, the second set of strands being laid over the first.|$|R
40|$|What {{is machine}} {{learning}}? Machine {{learning is a}} type of statistics that places particular emphasis on the use of advanced computational algorithms. As computers become more powerful, and modern experimental methods in areas such as imaging generate vast bodies of data, machine learning is becoming ever more important for extracting reliable and meaningful relationships and for making accurate predictions. Key <b>strands</b> of modern <b>machine</b> learning grew out of attempts to understand how large numbers of interconnected, more or less neuron-like elements could learn to achieve behaviourally meaningful computations and to extract useful features from images or sound waves. By the 1990 s, key approaches had converged on an elegant framework called ‘graphical models’, explained in Koller and Friedman, in which the nodes of a graph represent variables such as edges and corners in an image, or phonemes and words in speech. The probabilistic relationships between nodes are represented by conditional probability tables or simple functions whose parameters are learned from the data. There are three main problems in fitting graphical models to data: inference, parameter learning and structure learning. The inference problem is how to infer the probable values of unobserved variables when the values of a subset of the variables have been observed, and is a problem that perceptual systems need to solve if they are to infer the hidden causes of their sensory input. The parameter-learning problem is how to adjust the parameters governing the way in which one variable influences another, so that the graphical model is a better fit to some observed data. In the brain, this is presumably done by changing synapse strengths. The structure-learning problem is how to decide which unobserved variables are needed and how they must be connected to model the correlations between observed variables. In the brain, evolution and early pruning of connections presumably have a large role to play in determining the structure...|$|R
