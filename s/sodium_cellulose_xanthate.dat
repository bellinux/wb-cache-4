5000|$|Viscose rayon is a {{fiber of}} {{regenerated}} cellulose; it is structurally similar to cotton {{but may be}} produced {{from a variety of}} plants such as soy, bamboo, and sugar cane. Cellulose is a linear polymer of β-D-glucose units with the empirical formula (C6H10O5)n. To prepare viscose, dissolving pulp is treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide (typically 16-19% w/w) to form [...] "alkali cellulose," [...] which has the approximate formula C6H9O4-ONan. The alkali cellulose is then treated with carbon disulfide to form <b>sodium</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>xanthate.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Xanthate</b> esters of <b>cellulose</b> {{have great}} {{importance}} for the cellophane and viscose rayon industries. Routine chemical analyses tell nothing {{of the way the}} xanthate groups are distributed along the cellulose molecule, or among the three different kinds of hydroxyl groups in the glucose residues. Information of this kind is needed before the process of "ripening" of viscose can be understood in detail, or the physical properties of rayon or cellophane correlated with those of the viscose from which they are derived. Owing to the instability of <b>cellulose</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>xanthate,</b> most of the chemical methods of carbohydrate chemistry are inadmissible. Hence the sodium xanthate is converted to a more stable ester. If then all the remaining free hydroxyl groups are "blocked" and xanthate ester groups are subsequently removed, the regenerated hydroxyl groups are attached to carbon atoms Which were previously substituted with xanthate groups. Attempts by numerous workers to remove all of the xanthate sulfur from fully substituted starch or <b>cellulose</b> <b>xanthate</b> esters consistently failed to remove a small percentage. Moreover, dexanthation was invariably accompanied by removal of {{a small percentage of the}} other "blocking" substituents. [ [...] . ...|$|R

This investigation concerns the application of corona discharge treatment to the enhancement of the interfacial adhesion in viscose rayon / nylon- 66 and viscose rayon / polyester (PET) sheath-core type composite fibers. Nylon- 66 and polyester (PET) core fibers were pretreated in dry air and dry nitrogen coronas prior to coating (in-line) with a viscose rayon solution (<b>sodium</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>xanthate)</b> and regeneration of the (cellulosic) viscose rayon. Corona power levels of 100, 250, and 400 watts were {{used in conjunction with}} line speeds of 0. 43, 0. 54, and 0. 66 meters per second. The path length through the corona was 25. 4 centimeters. Uncoated, corona-treated samples were analyzed {{to determine the effects of}} the corona discharge on the morphology, wettability, surface radical density, linear density, and tensile properties of the core fibers. Morphological studies were conducted using scanning electron microscopy. Wettability was measured by means of a modified Washburn technique, and reported in terms of the cosine of the (liquid-solid) contact angle. Surface radical density was measured indirectly by measuring the depletion of a free radical scavenger from a solution through which the fibers were passed. Linear density and tensile properties were measured in accordance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards.

When {{a bunch of}} viscose fibres is placed in a solvent, a visco-elastic shell is formed, slowing down the diffusion of the solvent to non-dissolved fibres. It forms a highly concentrated, visco-elastic phase that disperses slowly through a pulling mechanism sucking this visco-elastic solution into the solvent.

In the regenerated cellulose process the cellulose is converted to <b>cellulose</b> <b>xanthate</b> which dissolves easily in caustic soda. The resulting viscous liquid can be extruded through spinnerettes and regenerated as man-made fibres. Cellulose can also be dissolved in some organic solvents directly and processed to regenerate the cellulose fibres in different forms.

40|$|Authors {{are members}} of the European Polysaccharide Network of Excellence (EPNOE) International audienceCellulose is the most {{abundant}} natural raw material on the earth. It can be applied to make various industrial products. However, the dissolution of cellulose is very hard to handle due to its strong fibrillar structure, which restricts its dissolution into a few solvents without chemical changes. Currently, most of the regenerated cellulosic materials are manufactured by the viscose process which has many shortcomings related to environmental issues. More recently, many efforts towards development of new solvent systems such as ionic liquids (ILs) or NaOH have been taken. In this work we investigate the interfacial and rheological properties of cellulose solutions prepared by enzymatic treatment prior to dissolution in NaOH. We compare the results with <b>cellulose</b> <b>xanthate,</b> cellulose-NaOH and cellulose-ILs systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The main methods {{applied to}} clean plant {{material}} for radiocarbon dating are not compound-specific and gen-erally remove only the easily exchangeable components by an acid-base-acid sequence and additional optional steps like Soxhlet extraction to remove resins and oxidative bleaching with NaClO 2. The products are normally clean enough for stan-dard 14 C measurement, {{but in some}} cases it is desirable to have pure cellulose, which remains unchanged and immobile over longer time ranges, better representing the original plant material. In this work, 2 more compound-specific but still simple methods were tested to separate the cellulose from wood. The viscose method is based on the xanthification process used in the textile industry, where the alkali-cellulose with CS 2 forms a soluble <b>cellulose</b> <b>xanthate,</b> which is then extracted and cellu-lose is recovered. The second procedure is based on the wood/cellulose dissolution in ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazo-lium chloride [BMIM]Cl, when the dissolved cellulose could be precipitated again by simply adding a water-acetone mixture. This process was recently reported, but still not used in sample preparation procedures for 14 C dating...|$|R
40|$|The {{agricultural}} use of polyacrylamide, PAM, as an additive in irrigation water has grown rapidly since commercial introduction in 1995, with over l million acres treated in 1998. PAM provides {{both economic and}} environmental benefits by improving water infiltration and reducing up to 98 % of erosion-induced soil losses — a yearly saving of tons of topsoil per acre. With as little as 5 ppm of PAM in the first irrigation water to run across the field, soil cohesion increases enough to prevent particle detachment and erosion. Stable soil/polymer flocs result from PAM's high molecular weight (typically> 12 million) and its affinity to soil via coulombic and Van der Waals attraction. Although water soluble linear PAM is the only class of commercial polymer presently used to reduce erosion during irrigation, other polymer additives have shown some potential. Biopolymers such as chitosan, starch <b>xanthate,</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>xanthate,</b> and acid-hydrolyzed <b>cellulose</b> microfibrils reduce shear-induced erosion; however concentrations at least 6 - 10 times higher than PAM are required to obtain the> 90 % runoff sediment reduction shown by commercial PAM.

The dependence of the intrinsic viscosity as a function of temperature of the enzyme-treated cellulose dissolved in 7. 6 %NaOH showed the same trend and similar values as for microcrystalline cellulose dissolved in this solvent. The assumed presence of insoluble material in cellulose-NaOH solution was proved by flow cytometry, which indicated an average particle diameter of the insoluble or swollen entities being around 600 nm.
