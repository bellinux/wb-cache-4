40|$|In the {{high-tech}} industry {{the call for}} higher precision and higher accuracy will never vanish. One of the aspects that influences precision and accuracy is transportation. To transport an object contact is needed. Stigmatically thinking, contact means having a mechanical connection between the transporter and the object to transport. However, if mechanical contact with {{the object is to}} be avoided, other means of transportation can be used. By avoiding mechanical contact certain benefits arise. For example contamination or surface damage (due to friction at the contact points) can be reduced by avoiding mechanical contact. The use of a device that can transport objects without contact is the basis for the thesis. The considered device uses an air bearing to carry and to position the object. This device is called the Contactless Wafer Handler (CWH). This contactless wafer handler is connected to an air supply system that generates the forces needed for carrying and actuation. To be able to support the object the air should be spread evenly across the object's surface. Also, the actuation function of the bearing requires the air flow to be controllable. This distribution of air is done by the <b>supply</b> <b>manifold.</b> A part of the CWH that consists of a labyrinth of channels, with inlets at the perimeter of the manifold and multiple outlets {{across the surface of the}} manifold. In this thesis the influence of the geometry of this <b>supply</b> <b>manifold</b> on the performance of the CWH is examined. The term performance is defined as the CWH's ability to accurately position the carried object. This performance is limited by numerous factors, one of which is the dynamics of the air in the manifold. The dynamic behavior is investigated in order to design manifolds that show optimal dynamic properties. The term optimal will be defined in this thesis. In order to obtain the optimal <b>supply</b> <b>manifold</b> the air dynamics are investigated. Using a setup consisting of a pneumatic valve and multiple air pressure sensors, models that can predict air dynamics are verified. Furthermore potentially interesting pseudo manifold geometries are analyzed. The pneumatic valve's actuation principle is piezo-electric and the valve is of the nozzle-flapper type. The pressure sensors measure strain in a membrane that deflects due to a pressure difference. The pneumatic valve and the pressure sensors used are of the same make as the ones used in the CWH. In this thesis it is shown that interesting geometries do exist and that their dynamics can be predicted with modeling. It is found that certain geometries can influence dynamics and that these influenced dynamics can benefit the performance of the CWH. MSDPMEMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E

The examples include Chern-Simons and Bott-Chern forms which are given by the transgression of the Chern character form. Chern-Simons forms are defined for a vector bundle over an arbitrary real manifold and are connected with the representation of combinations of Chern classes by the exact form ω = dφ. Bott-Chern forms are defined for holomorphic hermitian vector bundles over Kähler manifolds. These additional structures allow to use the double transgression ω = ∂∂φ to define this invariant.

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{centreless grinding}} machine was modified extensively to operate satisfactorily at high grinding wheel speeds and in the high rate centreless grinding regime. The principal modifications included the provision of a 75 k. W. d. c., variable speed, main drive motor which enables grinding wheel speeds up to 120 m/s to be employed and a coolant <b>supply</b> <b>manifold</b> was designed and manufactured-which was capable of delivering a high velocity coolant stream to the grinding zone. In addition, a measurement system was developed-which-allowed the grinding forces to be monitored and recorded in process. Two solutions for the accepted kinematic model of plunge feed cylindrical grinding are proposed. The general and more accurate solution takes account of the variable grit height and separation of the grinding wheel, whilst the particular and approximate analytical solution makes provision for variable grit separation only. The particular solution enabled parametric studies to be undertaken and allowed comparisons with the solutions proposed by other workers. The trends of theoretical grinding forces were predicted from analysis of the undeformed chip dimensions. The trends indicated two methods of achieving high stock removal rates, firstly, for a constant force value, higher stock removal rates are possible by increasing the grinding wheel speed and infeed-rate. Secondly, at a constant grinding wheel speed, and force level, reducing the workpiece speed and increasing the infeed-rate will yield higher stock removal rates. Experimental results were in agreement with these predictions. An extensive experimental programme investigating plunge feed centreless grinding of ferrous components was undertaken. Results from approximately 300 grinding experiments were used to establish a data bank of grinding parameters {{for a range of}} grinding conditions. High-rate centreless grinding {{has been shown to be}} a feasible first machining process. It has also been shown that the choice of kinematic conditions is important in achieving high stock removal rate grinding. Incorrect choice of kinematic conditions can cause problems of, workpiece burn, grinding vibrations and excessive power demands. Limit charts have been constructed which outline the boundaries to the process in terms of burn, grinding vibration and power limit. Operation between the boundaries is best achieved if the ratio of grinding wheel to workpiece speeds is in the range 90 - 200.
