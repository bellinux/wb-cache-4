5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because {{of the success of}} infantry tactics and changes in weaponry. However, because <b>such</b> <b>tactics</b> left the knight unmounted, the role of the war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E
5|$|The young princess {{depended}} on her devoted governess Louise Lehzen, who defended her against Conroy's machinations. As Victoria grew older, {{attempts were made}} by Conroy and the Duchess to secure Lehzen's removal, {{or at least the}} lessening of her influence. <b>Such</b> <b>tactics</b> proved unsuccessful, as the princess became more devoted to Lehzen than before, as evident in her journals.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{peaceful}} protests {{continued in}} front of the Consulate of Sri Lanka on the sidewalk of Spadina Avenue and at Queen's Park simultaneously. York Regional Police, Peel Regional Police, the OPP and the RCMP continued to help Toronto Police Service to prevent civil diobedience as what had happened the previous night. Toronto Mayor David Miller urged that <b>such</b> <b>tactics</b> as blockading the Gardiner Expressway not be used again. Police officials decried the use of children during such dangerous tactics.|$|E

During tournaments, players often prepare their sequence of three gestures prior to the tournament's commencement.|$|R
5|$|When Mardonius {{heard the}} Allied army {{was on the}} march, he retreated into Boeotia, near Plataea, trying to draw the Allies into open terrain where he could use his cavalry. The Allied army, {{under the command of}} the regent Pausanias, stayed on high ground above Plataea to protect {{themselves}} against <b>such</b> <b>tactics.</b> After several days of maneuver and stalemate, Pausanias ordered a night-time retreat towards the Allies' original positions. This maneuver went awry, leaving the Athenians, and Spartans and Tegeans isolated on separate hills, with the other contingents scattered further away near Plataea. Seeing that the Persians might never have a better opportunity to attack, Mardonius ordered his whole army forward. However, the Persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured Greek hoplites, and the Spartans broke through to Mardonius's bodyguard and killed him. After this the Persian force dissolved in rout; 40,000 troops managed to escape via the road to Thessaly, but the rest fled to the Persian camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the Greeks, finalising the Greek victory.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the late}} army {{appears to have}} evolved to some extent is in battle tactics. The older army of the Principate had relied on a barrage of heavy {{javelins}} (pila) followed by an infantry charge, which was often sufficient to shatter, or at least disorganise, the barbarian line. After that, legionaries were trained to engage in aggressive hand-to-hand combat, using the gladius short-sword to execute quick thrusts at the abdomen of their enemies, {{in a similar manner}} to more recent bayonet drill. In close combat, the Romans had the crucial advantage of superior armour, and <b>such</b> <b>tactics</b> very often resulted in the rout of the less well-equipped and trained barbarian foe. The mounted archers and slingers in front of the main infantry line would loose their missiles on the enemy before the infantry lines engaged and would then hastily retreat to the rear of their own infantry line, whence, in conjunction with the foot archers already there, they would loose a continuous rain of missiles on the enemy foot by shooting over the heads of their own infantry. The cavalry's task on each wing was to scatter the enemy cavalry facing them and then, if possible, to encircle the main body of enemy infantry and attack them from the flanks and rear.|$|E
5|$|When Mardonius {{heard that}} the Allied army was on the march, he retreated into Boeotia, near Plataea, trying to draw the Allies into open terrain where he could use his cavalry. The Allied army however, {{under the command of}} the Spartan regent Pausanias, stayed on high ground above Plataea to protect {{themselves}} against <b>such</b> <b>tactics.</b> Mardonius ordered a hit-and-run cavalry attack on the Greek lines, but the attack was unsuccessful and the cavalry commander killed. The outcome prompted the Allies to move to a position nearer the Persian camp, still on high ground. As a result, the Allied lines of communication were exposed. The Persian cavalry began to intercept food deliveries and finally managed to destroy the only spring of water available to the Allies. The Allied position now undermined, Pausanias ordered a night-time retreat towards their original positions. This went awry, leaving the Athenians, and Spartans and Tegeans isolated on separate hills, with the other contingents scattered further away, near Plataea itself. Seeing that he might never have a better opportunity to attack, Mardonius ordered his whole army forward. However, as at Thermopylae, the Persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured Greek hoplites, and the Spartans broke through to Mardonius's bodyguard and killed him. The Persian force thus dissolved in rout; 40,000 troops managed to escape via the road to Thessaly, but the rest fled to the Persian camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the Allies, thus finalising their victory.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the same}} logic, the new right/new left {{considers}} {{the killing of}} Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the scorched earth tactics of the Chinese nationalists.

25|$|Workplace bullying, like {{childhood}} bullying, is {{the tendency}} of individuals or groups to use persistent aggressive or unreasonable behaviour against a co-worker.

25|$|In some cases, {{the use of}} {{terrorism}} can be an aspect of guerrilla warfare. Terrorism is used to focus international attention on the guerrilla cause, kill opposition leaders, extort money from targets, intimidate the general population, create economic losses, and keep followers and potential defectors in line. As well, the use {{of terrorism}} can provoke the greater power to launch a disproportionate response, thus alienating a civilian population which might be sympathetic to the terrorist's cause. <b>Such</b> <b>tactics</b> may backfire and cause the civil population to withdraw its support, or to back countervailing forces against the guerrillas.|$|E

25|$|As in the 2002–2007 Parliament, the Somare {{government}} {{during its}} second term (2007–2012) {{took advantage of}} the controlling parliamentary procedures by using its majority to overpower challenges and adjourning Parliament. A greater political stability has been the outcome of <b>such</b> <b>tactics,</b> but this caused a nation widespread of complaints of ‘executive dominance’ of Parliament, and an overload of blogging against Somare directly. Somare's attempts to block, and suppress the Defence Board of Enquiry report into the Moti affair was criticized openly. There was also criticism of Somare for failure to submit financial returns required under the country’s Leadership Code.|$|E
25|$|Opinion polling in Turkey remains controversial, {{with many}} {{politicians}} and commentators calling the polls a 'perception operation' (algı operasyonu) that {{was intended to}} convince voters that the AKP were significantly ahead of the opposition parties. <b>Such</b> <b>tactics</b> were also allegedly employed during the 2014 presidential election. These claims have been backed up {{by the fact that}} many polling companies do not even have any record of existence and most do not release a detailed breakdown of their polling. The issue of bogus opinion polls even led to a CHP advert late during the campaign to dissuade voters from voting in accordance to polling results.|$|E
25|$|The Hack-a-Shaq {{name was}} {{originally}} used during O'Neal's college playing days at LSU and during his NBA tenure with the Orlando Magic. At that time, however, the term referred simply to opposing teams employing an especially physical {{style of play}} in defending against O'Neal. Teams sometimes defended him by bumping, striking or pushing him after he received the ball {{in order to ensure}} that he did not score easily with layups or slam dunks. Because of O'Neal's poor free throw shooting, teams did not fear the consequences having personal fouls called against them when using <b>such</b> <b>tactics.</b> However, once Nelson's off-the-ball fouling strategy became prevalent, the term Hack-a-Shaq was applied to this new tactic, and the original usage was largely forgotten.|$|E

50|$|In 1670, {{wandering}} Muslim clerics from Mauretania {{stirred up}} a {{rebellion against the}} Wolof people by a ruse. They promised to show the Wolof how to produce millet without the labor of planting. During the ensuing rebellion, the Mauretanians invaded, killed the rulers of Waalo and Kayor and defeated the burba Jolof. However, when the Mauretanians could not deliver on their promise, the Wolof restored their rulers and drove the invaders out. This claim is questionable because most rural Wolofs are great farmers who produce millet and other crops. To believe that the Wolof would have fallen for <b>such</b> <b>tactic</b> is most unlikely. The Mauretanians still remained a problem, however; and Waalo in particular suffered from their constant raids.|$|R
25|$|To {{ensure the}} {{effectiveness}} of such an elite force, many Commandos are sent overseas to nations such as the US, UK and France to receive extra training in specialized areas that the Lebanese Armed Forces are unable to provide, {{due to a lack}} of resources. While training in Lebanon, each Commando is instructed in the art of urban and guerrilla warfare. So rigorous is their domestic training regime that each commando is subjected to a training timetable consisting of 20 hours per day for 3 months, which is divided into different stages. Each stage consists of a specialized form of warfare and its associated tactics. <b>Such</b> <b>tactics</b> include: sabotage, sniping, extraction and covert operations. The Lebanese Special Forces are also well known for killing and eating snakes with their bare hands at graduation ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the Chindits contributed to the overall success of the Allied armies in Burma through the {{innovations}} in air supply techniques and organisation that their operations required. The Allied air forces were later to use these tactics to supply increasingly large forces that were cut off by the enemy, or were operating independently of road or rail lines of communication. Conversely, {{it has been argued}} that the apparent success of the Chindits led some Japanese commanders to believe that they could employ their own incursion tactics on a much larger scale, and that when they came to implement <b>such</b> <b>tactics</b> during the Chindwin offensive of early 1944, lacking the necessary air support that had enabled the Allies to be successful, the result was disastrous and ultimately led to defeat at both Kohima and Imphal, and later on the plains of Burma in 1945.|$|E
25|$|It {{was very}} slow and {{therefore}} a most impressive assault with steel. At times the tanks almost 'stood on their heads', twisting to avoid mounds of rock and to get {{at right angles to}} the huge cracks and shell holes, but always getting nearer and nearer. Like beetles trying to climb an inverted ice-cream cone, they slipped a little, hung suspended and then went onwards towards the top. The behaviour of these tanks upset the Germans. <b>Such</b> <b>tactics</b> were untanklike, and no answer was contained in their military textbooks. Too late now to shift the anti-tank guns from their positions, too late to make alternative arrangements to deal with the new menace. There was only one answer – retreat, and that's what the Germans did – leaving the British tanks and infantry in possession of the first slope up the heights of Longstop. So ended 23 April.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the past}} two decades, the {{government}} and NGOs have come together to tackle the low prenatal care rates {{in an effort to}} improve maternal and child morbidity and mortality outcomes. One <b>such</b> <b>tactic,</b> the Safe Motherhood Initiative, is providing financial incentives for pregnant mothers to come to their prenatal care check-ups. These types of programs pay anywhere from 500 and 1,500 Nepali Rupees or $5 - $10 USD, depending on the region. Other incentives include providing free services for maternal related issues and having a 24-hour delivery service. Through the national increase on funding of these particular health concerns, there have been large improvements concerning the 5th Millennium Development Goal (as evidenced under Health Statistics).|$|R
