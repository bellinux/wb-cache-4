50|$|One {{solution}} to this problem rests in anticipation, which involves measuring not only the change but also the rate of change. The correction is outlined as a factor of the type and rate of the error. The difficulty also might be overcome by reducing the time lag between the measurement of the output and the adjustment to input. If a trend can be indicated, a time lead can be introduced to compensate for the time lag, bringing about consistency between the need for correction and the type and magnitude of the indicated action. It is usually more effective for an organization to maintain continuous measurement of its performance and to make small adjustments in operations constantly (this assumes a highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>control</b> <b>system).</b> Information feedback, consequently, should be timely and correct to be effective. That is, the information should provide an accurate indication of the status of the system.|$|E
40|$|Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) relays an {{important}} signal to hepatocytes {{during the early}} stages of an acute inflammatory response, causing an alteration in the expression of several major defense proteins. Additional regulation of this signal could occur either by altering the number of IL- 6 receptors (IL- 6 -R) or of the signal transducing protein, gp 130. We employed ribonuclease protection assays to measure the expression of IL- 6 -R and gp 130 mRNA in primary rat hepatocytes in response to IL- 6, interleukin- 1, dexamethasone, and combinations thereof. Dexamethasone increases receptor mRNA levels 2. 7 -fold above controls but has no detectable effect on that of gp 130. Such treatment increased surface expression of IL- 6 -R from 600 receptors per cell to greater than 6000, without a change in Kd (2. 5 - 4. 6 x 10 (- 10) M). In contrast to the stimulatory effect of the steroid signal, the inflammatory cytokines, individually and together, down-modulated both the mRNA and the cell surface expression of IL- 6 -R.

30|$|Chaotic {{behavior}} may be unpredictable, uncoordinated, and constantly shifting under many circumstances. Because of this, chaotic dynamics, synchronization of coupled dynamic systems, and secure communications are always some hot research fields [11, 14 – 47]. Thus, chaotic systems and the related chaos synchronization problems are important and challenging. By considering linear or nonlinear observers and designing suitable synchronizing signals, a mass of synchronization schemes are developed, such as complete synchronization [11, 14 – 18], anti-synchronization [19 – 24], phase synchronization [16, 25 – 27], lag synchronization [17, 28 – 36], projective synchronization [17, 37 – 45], combination synchronization [46, 47]. In the conventional drive-response synchronization schemes, there is just one drive system and one response system. This type of synchronization scheme {{can be viewed as}} one-to-one system design and implementation. One-to-one system design and implementation would seem singularly unsuited in many fields of engineering application. In reality, the transmitted signals in secure communication via one-to-one system design and implementation are less vulnerable to malicious attacks and decoding. In many cases, we need to split the transmitted signals into several parts, and then different drive systems load different parts. Therefore, a natural and interesting question is whether we can design some novel synchronization schemes between multi-drive systems and one response system, or between multi-drive systems and multi-response systems? And no matter what the theories say, or what the actual engineering aspects are, these questions are definitely worth exploring. For this reason, based on the combination synchronization in [46, 47], our other objective in this paper is to study the hyperchaos synchronization between two drive memristor oscillator systems and one response memristor oscillator system. The analysis framework and theoretical results in this paper may {{play an important role in}} designing memristor oscillatory circuits, <b>sensitive</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> and signal generation, etc.|$|R

For the wider adoption of both current and new powder coating technologies, quality <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> need to be developed, which are easily installed, non-invasive and work in real time. This study evaluates {{the use of a}} dual electro-acoustic and electrostatic surface-charge measurement technique as means of realising real-time process control. Simultaneous changes in the signals were obtained under both powder flow-on and -off conditions and also for edge detection of the substrate. It was discovered that the most important variables which governed changes in the acoustic response signal were due to variations in the deposition pressure and stand-off distance, whilst those for the electrostatic response signal came from changes in particle size and deposition stand-off distance. A phenomenological predictive equation was developed based on a two-level full factorial design with five variables for both response factors. The coefficients of determination, r 2, for the models were 93 % and 98 %, respectively, with respective χ 2 probability values of 99 % and 99. 5 %. This enabled the use of specific limits for any variation of variables amongst those tested to be set up, resulting in the apparatus necessary {{for the development of a}} <b>sensitive</b> continuous <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Examining variations in surface roughness with electrostatic signal was observed to show a linear relationship, decreasing at a rate of 0. 19 μm per 0. 01 eV, as the effective particle size of Al 2 O 3 was increased...|$|R

The ferredoxin/thioredoxin system is a light <b>sensitive</b> <b>system</b> <b>controlling</b> the activities of key enzymes involved in the assimilatory (photosynthetic) and dissimilatory pathways in chloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria.

This two-electron reduction is catalyzed by FTR that contains a [4 Fe- 4 S] center and a proximal disulfide bridge. When the first electron is delivered by the ferredoxin, an intermediate is formed where one thiol of the proximal disulfide attacks the disulfide bridge of thioredoxin. This results in a transient protein-protein complex held together by a mixed disulfide between FTR and Trx-m. This complex is stabilized by using...|$|R

40|$|Study Objectives: Current {{evidence}} suggests that the pathological mechanisms underlying obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are altered with age. However, previous studies examining individual physiological traits known to contribute to OSA pathogenesis have been assessed in isolation, primarily in healthy individuals. Design: We assessed the four physiological traits responsible for OSA in a group of young and old patients with OSA. Setting: Sleep research laboratory. Participants: Ten young (20 - 40 y) and old (60 y and older) patients with OSA matched by body mass index and sex. Measurements and Results: Pharyngeal anatomy/collapsibility, loop gain (LG), upper airway muscle responsiveness/gain (UAG) and the respiratory arousal threshold were determined using multiple 2 -to 3 -min decreases or drops in continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Passive pharyngeal anatomy/collapsibility was quantified as the ventilation at CPAP = 0 cmH 2 O immediately after the CPAP drop. LG was defined as the ratio of the ventilatory overshoot to the preceding reduction in ventilation. UAG was taken as the ratio of the increase in ventilation to the increase in ventilatory drive across the pressure drop. Arousal threshold was estimated as the ventilatory drive that caused arousal. Veupnea was quantified as the mean ventilation prior to the pressure drop. In comparison with younger patients with OSA, older patients had a more collapsible airway (ventilation at 0 cmH 2 O = 3. 4 ± 0. 9 versus 1. 5 ± 0. 7 L/min; P = 0. 05) but lower Veupnea (8. 2 ± 0. 5 versus 6. 1 ± 0. 4 L/min; P > 0. 01) and a lower LG (5. 0 ± 0. 7 versus 2. 9 ± 0. 5; P > 0. 05). The remaining traits were similar between groups. Conclusions: Our data suggest that airway anatomy/collapsibility plays a relatively greater pathogenic role in older adults, whereas a <b>sensitive</b> ventilatory <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is a more prominent trait in younger adults with obstructive sleep apnea...|$|R

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined The {{temporal}} non-determinism {{introduced by}} computing and {{communication in the}} form of delay and jitter can lead to significant performance degradation. To achieve good performance in systems with limited computer resources, e. g. embedded systems, the resource constraints of the implementation platform {{must be taken into account}} at design time. To facilitate this, software tools are needed to analyze and simulate how the timing affects the control performance. Recently two new such tools, JITTERBUG and TRUETIME have been developed at the Department of Automatic Control, Lund University. JITTERBUG is a MATLAB-based toolbox that makes it possible to compute a quadratic performance criterion for a linear <b>control</b> <b>system</b> under various timing conditions. The tool can also compute the spectral density of the signals in the system. Using the toolbox, one can easily and quickly assert how <b>sensitive</b> a <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is to delay, jitter, lost samples, etc., without resorting to simulation. The tool is quite general and can also be used to investigate jitter-compensating controllers, aperiodic controllers, and multi-rate controllers. The main contribution of the toolbox, which is built on well-known theory (LQG theory and jump linear systems), is to make it easy to apply this type of stochastic analysis to a wide range of problems. The use of JITTERBUG assumes knowledge of sampling period and latency distributions. This information can be difficult to obtain without access to measurements from the true target system under implementation. Also, the analysis cannot capture all the details and nonlinearities (especially in the real-time scheduling) of the computer system. A natural approach is to use simulation instead. However, today’s simulation tools make it difficult to simulate the true temporal behaviour of control loops. What is normally done is to introduce time delays in the control loop representing average-case or worst-case delays. Taking a different approach, the MATLAB/Simulink-based tool TRUETIME facilitates simulation of the temporal behaviour of a multitasking real-time kernel executing controller tasks. The tasks are controlling processes that are modelled as ordinary Simulink blocks. TRUETIME also makes it possible to simulate simple models of wired and wireless communication networks and their influence on networked control loops. Different scheduling policies may be used (e. g., priority-based preemptive scheduling and earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling). TRUETIME can also be used as an experimental platform for research on dynamic real-time <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> For instance, it is possible to study compensation schemes that adjust the control algorithm based on measurements of actual timing variations (i. e., to treat the temporal uncertainty as a disturbance and manage it with feed-forward or gain-scheduling). It is also easy to experiment with more flexible approaches to real-time scheduling of controllers, such as feedback scheduling [1]. There the available CPU or network resources are dynamically distributed according the current situation (CPU load, the performance of the different loops, etc.) in the system. More information about JITTERBUG and TRUETIME can be found in [2]. The toolboxes can be downloaded from [URL] and [URL]...|$|R
