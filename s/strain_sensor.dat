50|$|Promoted by {{the demand}} for {{wearable}} devices, graphene has been {{proved to be a}} promising material for potential applications in flexible and highly sensitive strain sensors. An environment-friendly and cost-effective method to fabricate large-area ultrathin graphene films is proposed for highly sensitive flexible <b>strain</b> <b>sensor.</b> The assembled graphene films are derived rapidly at the liquid/air interface by Marangoni effect and the area can be scaled up. These graphene-based strain sensors exhibit extremely high sensitivity with gauge factor of 1037 at 2% strain, which represents the highest value for graphene platelets at this small deformation so far.|$|E

A surface plasma treatment, {{followed by a}} solution based, low temperature drop casting process was developed and utilized to fabricate the <b>strain</b> <b>sensor.</b> The fabricated SWNTs <b>strain</b> <b>sensor</b> functions as a two-terminal resistor which changes its resistance when the sensor is stretched.

40|$|Compared with {{traditional}} conductive fillers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have unique advantages, i. e., excellent mechanical properties, high electrical conductivity and thermal stability. Nanocomposites as piezoresistive films provide an interesting approach for {{the realization of}} large area <b>strain</b> <b>sensors</b> with high sensitivity and low manufacturing costs. A polymer-based nanocomposite with carbon nanomaterials as conductive filler can be deposited on a flexible substrate of choice and this leads to mechanically flexible layers. Such <b>sensors</b> allow the <b>strain</b> measurement for both integral measurement on a certain surface and local measurement at a certain position depending on the <b>sensor</b> geometry. <b>Strain</b> <b>sensors</b> based on carbon nanostructures can overcome several limitations of conventional <b>strain</b> <b>sensors,</b> e. g., sensitivity, adjustable measurement range and integral measurement on big surfaces. The novel technology allows realizing <b>strain</b> <b>sensors</b> which can be easily integrated even as buried layers in material systems. In this review paper, we discuss the dependence of strain sensitivity on different experimental parameters such as composition of the carbon nanomaterial/polymer layer, type of polymer, fabrication process and processing parameters.

30|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a {{comprehensive}} multi-scale three-dimensional (3 D) resistor network numerical model {{to predict the}} piezoresistivity behavior of a nanocomposite material composed of an insulating polymer matrix and conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This material {{is expected to be}} used as highly sensitive resistance-type <b>strain</b> <b>sensors</b> due to its high piezoresistivity defined as the resistance change ratio divided by the mechanical strain. In this multi-scale 3 D numerical model, three main working mechanisms, which are well known to induce the piezoresistivity of <b>strain</b> <b>sensors</b> fabricated from nanocomposites, are for the first time considered systematically. They are (a) the change of the internal conductive network formed by the CNTs, (b) the tunneling effect among neighboring CNTs, and (c) the CNTs’ piezoresistivity. Comparisons between the present numerical results and our previous experimental ones were also performed to validate the present numerical model. The influence of the CNTs’ piezoresistivity on the total piezoresistivity of nanocomposite <b>strain</b> <b>sensors</b> is explored in detail and further compared with that of the other two mechanisms. It is found that the first two working mechanisms (i.e., the change of the internal conductive network and the tunneling effect) play a major role on the piezoresistivity of the nanocomposite <b>strain</b> <b>sensors,</b> whereas the contribution from the CNTs’ piezoresistivity is quite small. The present numerical results can provide valuable information for designing highly sensitive resistance-type <b>strain</b> <b>sensors</b> made from various nanocomposites composed of an insulating polymer matrix and conductive nanofillers.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent years, carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have been}} utilized {{for a variety}} of applications, including nanoelectronics and various types of sensors. In particular, researchers have sought {{to take advantage of the}} superior electrical properties of carbon nanotubes for fabricating novel strain sensors. This article presents a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) -polyelectrolyte (PE) composite thin film <b>strain</b> <b>sensor</b> fabricated with a layer-by-layer (LbL) process. Optimization of bulk SWNT-PE <b>strain</b> <b>sensor</b> properties is achieved by varying various LbL fabrication parameters, followed by characterization of strain-sensing electromechanical responses. A resistor and capacitor (RC) -circuit model is proposed and validated with electrical impedance spectroscopy to fit experimental results and to identify equivalent circuit element parameters sensitive to strain. Experimental results suggest consistent trends between SWNT and PE concentrations to <b>strain</b> <b>sensor</b> sensitivities. Simply by adjusting the weight fraction of SWNT solutions and film thickness, strain sensitivities between 0. 1 and 1. 8 have been achieved. While SWNT-PE strain sensitivity is lower than some metal-foil strain gauges (2), the LbL method allows for precise tailoring of the properties (i. e., strain sensitivity, resistivity, among others) of a high-capacity (10, 000 mmm 1) homogeneous multilayer <b>strain</b> <b>sensor.</b> Key Words: carbon nanotube composite, electrical impedance spectroscopy, layer-by-layer, nanotechnology, <b>strain</b> <b>sensor...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of using carbon nanotube coated flexible cloth as strain gauges was studied. Samples were prepared by sonicating strips of cloth inside a 1 mg/ml carbon nanotube in propylene carbonate solution. A dynamic mechanical analyzer was built that applied uniaxial cyclical strains to the samples and recorded {{the force and}} strain applied. The DMA also provided a constant voltage to the samples while recording the resistance response of the strain gauges. The samples were tested using the dynamic mechanical analyzer for their response to variables such as strain and time. The samples were successfully tested at strains ranging from 1 % to 50 %. The conductivity of the samples was measured. We studied the effects that a carboxylate and the sulfonate functional groups of the carbon nanotubes have on the <b>strain</b> <b>sensors,</b> {{the effect of the}} sonication time, and the effect that leaving the <b>strain</b> <b>sensors</b> inside the solution for different amount of times has on the <b>strain</b> <b>sensors.</b> It was discovered that the samples dried overtime, thus decreasing the conductivity of the samples and damaging the <b>strain</b> <b>sensors.</b> An encapsulation method was developed and studied to counter the drying effect. The results showed that the encapsulation method did delay the decaying of the samples. Moreover, it was concluded that the sulfonate group had higher changes in resistance than the carboxylate group. While increased sonication time did not seem to have a measurable effect on the resistance of the sulfonate CNT samples, this was not true for the carboxylate group CNTs. The carboxylate group CNTs seemed to have a higher initial resistance with longer sonication time and a lower resistance with increasing time sitting in the solution. Overall, it was concluded that carbon nanotubes have a promising potential as macro level <b>strain</b> <b>sensors</b> for high-elongation applications but more development is yet to be done. by Juan D.
