All of the main dishes (except those made with rice) are eaten alongside bread.

It was said that Singapore even copied Penang's Chingay processions in order to <b>spice</b> <b>up</b> its own Chinese New Year festivities. An annual Chingay parade is held in George Town every December, though Chingay performances are also a common feature of Chinese festivities and major state celebrations in Penang.|$|E

The game's AI was judged adequate to provide for such fights, being cunning enough to trick others to crash into the walls of narrow openings, and good enough to detect and warn their wingmen of enemies coming up directly behind them. There are those who expressed minor disappointments with the AI tending to collide too often with other objects.

The verses alternate from the chords of F and C. The track also draws from the hip hop, funk, and dance-pop genres. Mike Joseph of PopMatters observed that the song shows influences by 1970s funk music, and contains limited elements of 1980s go-go. According to Phil Harrison of Time Out, [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] consists of a steady [...] "long crescendo, welding galloping beats and a steamrolling two-note riff", accompanied by several genres of music, which he qualified as [...] "multi-tracked". Spence D. of IGN Music noted that the song consists of frequent whistles as well as crashing cymbal dominated scatter rhythms and a beat which fits the [...] "powerful, loud, confident lines" [...] in which Beyoncé asks {{for the attention of}} her man, and urges women to have a beautiful dress to <b>spice</b> <b>up</b> their sexual life.

In the picture, she portrayed Ann Farber, who with her husband and son are held hostage by a pair of sociopathic teenagers. Watts also served as a producer, as this charge was for her [...] "one way to <b>spice</b> <b>up</b> the deal and be involved in all the creative decisions". The movie generated mixed reviews and received a limited theatrical release in the United States, grossing $7million, on a $15million budget. Newsweek felt that Watts [...] "hurls herself into her physically demanding role with heroic conviction". David Stratton, from At the Movies concluded that she was [...] "as usual, really fine".

Isler praised Reddick's performance, but continued [...] "besides the Broyles characterization, this episode kind of fell flat. The plot unfolds slowly, and the first sixty percent of this episode is kind of a yawner. The only things that really <b>spice</b> <b>up</b> the story are Walter's antics (which are very amusing, as usual).
