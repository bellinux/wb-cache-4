25|$|According to A.B. Atkinson, social {{security}} received much more {{attention from the}} first Wilson government than it did during the previous thirteen years of Conservative government. Following its victory in the 1964 general election, Wilson's government began to increase social benefits. Prescription charges for medicines were abolished immediately, while pensions were raised to a record 21% of average male industrial wages. In 1966, the system of National Assistance (a social assistance scheme for the poor) was overhauled and renamed <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Benefit.</b> The means test was replaced with a statement of income, and benefit rates for pensioners (the great majority of claimants) were increased, granting them a real gain in income. Before the 1966 election, the widow's pension was tripled. Due to austerity measures following an economic crisis, prescription charges were re-introduced in 1968 {{as an alternative to}} cutting the hospital building programme, although those sections of the population who were most in need (including <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefit</b> claimants, the long-term sick, children, and pensioners) were exempted from charges.|$|E

About 100,000 people were affected by this change, half of whom were receiving <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Benefit</b> under the social security scheme. The Act also made improvements to the Widow's Pension scheme by introducing a scale that started at 30 shillings a week for women widowed at the age of 40 and rose to the full rate of £5 at the age of 50.|$|E

2500|$|As {{noted by}} Ben Pimlott, {{the gap between}} those on lowest incomes {{and the rest of}} the {{population}} [...] "had been significantly reduced" [...] under Wilson's first government. The first Wilson government thus saw the distribution of income became more equal, while reductions in poverty took place. These achievements were mainly brought about by several increases in social welfare benefits, such as <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefit,</b> pensions and family allowances, the latter of which were doubled between 1964 and 1970 (although most of the increase in family allowances did not come about until 1968). A new system of rate rebates was introduced, which benefited one million households by the end of the 1960s. Increases in national insurance benefits in 1965, 1967, 1968 and 1969 ensured that those dependant on state benefits saw their disposable incomes rise faster than manual wage earners, while income differentials between lower income and higher income workers were marginally narrowed. Greater progressivity was introduced in the tax system, with greater emphasis on direct (income-based) as opposed to indirect (typically expenditure-based) taxation as a means of raising revenue, with the amount raised by the former increasing twice as much as that of the latter. Also, in spite of an increase in unemployment, the poor improved their share of the national income while that of the rich was slightly reduced. Despite various cutbacks after 1966, expenditure on services such as education and health was still much higher as a proportion of national wealth than in 1964. In addition, by raising taxes to pay their reforms, the government paid careful attention to the principle of redistribution, with disposable incomes rising for the lowest paid while falling amongst the wealthiest during its time in office.|$|E

40|$|The Swiss {{pension scheme}} {{is based on}} three pillars; the first one aims to cover the vital needs, the second one to secure the {{standard}} of living of the pensioner and the last one is an individual retirement savings (voluntary). In theory, a retiree benefiting from a full pension of the first pillar and second pillar, should not need <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefits</b> (State’s help), at least until that he has to enter in a nursing home. The <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefits</b> are allocated to the pensioner benefiting from the first pillar and who does not have enough resources to cover his vital needs. Due to the increase of the life expectancy and the population ageing, many reforms are currently discussing in view to keep the same level of assistance without increasing the State’s expenses. This study focuses {{on the fact that the}} Federal Council wants to prohibit the right to take the mandatory part of the second pillar as a lump sum at the retirement age. It analyses the potential impacts that this reform would have on the Government, the provident institutions and the future retirees. It also analyses if there is real correlation between the fact of withdrawing the mandatory part of the second pillar and the early economic dependency towards the <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefits.</b> The last part of the analysis is dedicated to provide an international perspective of the problematic with a comparison with the choice of the United Kingdom to implement the inverse reform in 2015. The results of this study are based on analytical researches, qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey based on a sample of fifty person aged between 55 and 75 years old. It appears that the women are the ones who need the most the <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefits</b> during the retirement, as they contribute less during their careers. Also there is a correlation between the socio professional background and the life expectancy, meaning that someone with only a mandatory school degree will live in average less than someone with a university degree. This aspect is important for this study as the choice of taking a lump sum is also linked to the life expectancy of the pensioner. And as this reform will affect only the mandatory part, it could be prejudicial for the low to medium class. It is still not proved that there is a correlation between the withdrawal of the capital at the retirement age and the necessity of <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefits.</b> But it seems that most of the pensioners that required <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefits</b> are in general independent that overlooked to save for their retirement, part-time jobs, and housewives. This leads to ask if the fact to banish the right to take a lump sum will really diminishing the economic dependency of the pensioners toward the <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefits...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{consequences}} for household economy in connection with unemployment. Various mechanisms that influence the relationship between unemployment and the reception of <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefits</b> are described and analyzed. The labour market, the social insurance system and the adjustment strategies of families are fields {{of particular interest to}} this study. The economic systems of support that have developed are dominated by the unemployment insurance. Those, whose unemployment benefits have ceased or who for some other reason are not covered by the insurance, have to resort to <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefits.</b> The differences in level between working, receiving unemployment <b>benefits</b> or <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefits</b> can be described in terms of a scale of income. The aspect of the scale varies strongly between different types of families. The empirical point of reference for this dissertation is the close-down of a pulp industry (Ncb in Köpmanholmen 130 km south of Umeå in the north of Sweden). The development of those made redundant has been studied with regard to reception of <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefits,</b> income and adjustment strategies. Data about income and <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefits</b> were collected from registers at the local tax charge office and the local administration of social services. 83 out of 444 households were interviewed about adjustment strategies. The close-down in question proved to be exceptional in many aspects. The expected "social catastrophe" never occured due to the economic upswing, raised unemployment benefits and ambitious labour market policy efforts, among other things. Only a very small minority of those made redundant have received <b>supplementary</b> <b>benefits</b> after the close-down. This has been the case although many of those made redundant have been removed from the open labour market with a subsequent lowering of their income level. Amongst those made redundant many different patterns of adjustment havè been observed. It appears that those who lack work {{after a couple of years}} after the close-down are often characterized by passivity, whereas those who have been employed are often characterized by activity. Finally the variation in patterns of adjustment can be seen as a social policy problem. Judging from the results a combination of the institutional and marginal social policy strategies would be desirable. Reform schemes can be suggested that are based on a wish to supplement the preventive and institutional social policy with selective features where the adjustment strategies of families should provide an important resource potential. digitalisering@um...|$|R
