25|$|Columbia was {{the first}} shuttle {{to arrive at the}} SLF via the <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft on March 24, 1979.|$|E
25|$|While {{the project}} was seriously considered, it proved impractically large, and NASA chose to develop the Boeing 747-based <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> from surplus {{commercial}} aircraft instead.|$|E
25|$|At 12:51p.m. on Friday, September 21, 2012, a <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft {{carrying}} the Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at LAX on runway 25L. An estimated 10,000 people saw the shuttle land. Interstate 105 was backed up for miles at a standstill. Imperial Highway {{was shut down}} for spectators. It was quickly taken off the <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft, a modified Boeing 747, and was moved to a United Airlines hangar. The shuttle spent about {{a month in the}} hangar while it was prepared to be transported to the California Science Center.|$|E
50|$|The port {{also uses}} {{straddle}} carriers (also known as <b>shuttle</b> <b>carriers),</b> which move containers between the automated container stacking {{area and the}} quay cranes. Terminal tractors and trans lifter trailers - which move cassettes, onto which containers are loaded - are used on the port's land side to move containers between the automated stacking area and the port's rail terminal and inspection facilities.|$|R
40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} organisms, DNA replication and RNA biogenesis {{occur in}} the cell nucleus, whereas protein synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm. Integration of these activities depends on selective transport of proteins and ribonucleoprotein particles between the two compartments. Transport across the nuclear envelope occurs through large multiprotein structures, termed nuclear pore complexes. It is signal-mediated and requires both energy and soluble factors, including <b>shuttling</b> <b>carriers.</b> Here I summarize current understanding of nucleocytoplasmic transport and illustrate the importance of regulated transport for signal transduction...|$|R
50|$|The port island, which {{includes}} the region’s only semi-automated container terminal, is 2.7 km2 (1.05 square miles) and is situated some 5 km (3.12 miles) offshore. It is joined to the onshore by a north and south causeway and a 1 km-long road and utility bridge. The port’s container yard has nine of the world's largest ship-to-shore quay cranes, 42 automated stacking cranes, and 23 <b>shuttle</b> <b>carriers.</b> The onshore port area, which connects the port with Kizad (Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi) hosts customs, immigration, container freight, inspection, and security facilities.|$|R
25|$|Lockheed {{proposed}} a twin body C-5 as a <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft {{to counter the}} Conroy Virtus, but the design was turned down {{in favor of the}} Boeing 747.|$|E
25|$|Endeavour was {{returned}} to Florida {{on top of one}} of NASA's <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft, arriving back at the Kennedy Space Center 12 December 2008 after a three-day cross-country trip.|$|E
25|$|The final {{landing of}} a space shuttle {{occurred}} on July 21, 2011 by Atlantis for STS-135. Discovery and Endeavour took off from the SLF {{on top of the}} <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft for museums in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles.|$|E
50|$|Knutsen OAS Shipping is {{a privately}} owned {{shipping}} company located in Haugesund, Norway. The {{company has a}} fleet of purpose-built <b>shuttle</b> tankers, chemical <b>carriers</b> and product tankers internationally. The fleet consists of 41 <b>shuttle</b> tankers, chemical <b>carriers</b> and product tankers. In 2009 the company had an onshore staff of 64 to handle projects and operation of the fleet, 430 administrative employees offshore and about 800 foreign employees.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Lockheed Martin {{proposed}} the Jupiter space tug.

40|$|Abstract:- Since {{the vessels}} are getting larger and the {{efficiency}} of container terminals is more required, highly automated container terminals are being developed and operated. The ECT in Netherlands and the CTA in Germany- fully automated container terminal (ACT) – have improved productivity through automated yard and transportation areas. But after building these terminals, Automated <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carriers</b> (ASCs) were developed {{to make up for}} the weak points of Automated Guided vehicles (AGVs) through technical development. And these ASCs are in operation at Brisbane berth 7 in Australia. This study presents important considerations to be taken in the design of ACT using ASCs through the analysis of ASC characteristics. It also analyzes and compares the performance of two equipments by using a simulation method. Key-Words:- simulation, transportation equipment, analysis of performance, automated container terminal...|$|R
25|$|The Antonov An-225 was {{designed}} to airlift the Energia rocket's boosters and the Buran orbiter for the Soviet space program. It was developed {{as a replacement for}} the Myasishchev VM-T. The An-225's original mission and objectives are almost identical to that of the United States' <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 2007 the Space Shuttle Atlantis made {{a stop at}} {{the airport}} while being transported on top of the NASA Boeing 747 <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft (SCA) from Edwards Air Force Base to Florida—one of the few visits by the shuttle to a {{commercial}} airport. After a brief stay it was flown on to Offutt Air Force Base.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, NASA {{considered}} the C-5 for the <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft role, {{to transport the}} Space Shuttle to Kennedy Space Center. However, they rejected it {{in favor of the}} Boeing 747, in part due to the 747's low-wing design. In contrast, the Soviet Union chose to transport its shuttles using the high-winged An-225, which derives from the An-124, which is similar in design and function to the C-5.|$|E
40|$|The {{extensive}} and multifaceted traffic between nucleus and cytoplasm is handled {{by a single}} type of macromolecular assembly called the nuclear pore complex (NPC). While being readily accessible to ions and metabolites, the NPC imposes stringent selectivity on the passage of proteins and RNA, tightly regulating their traffic between the two major cellular compartments. Here we discuss how <b>shuttling</b> <b>carriers,</b> which mediate the transport of macromolecules through NPCs, cross its permeability barrier. We also discuss the co-existence of receptor-mediated macromolecular transport with the passive diffusion of small molecules {{in the context of}} the various models suggested for the permeability barrier of the NPC. Finally, we speculate on how nuclear transport receptors negotiate the dependence of their NPC-permeating abilities on hydrophobic interactions with the necessity of avoiding these promiscuous interactions in the cytoplasm and nucleus...|$|R
50|$|Selected for NASA Astronaut Corps in January 1978, Scobee {{completed}} his training in August 1979. While awaiting his first orbital spaceflight mission, {{he served as}} an instructor pilot for the <b>Shuttle's</b> 747 <b>carrier</b> aircraft. In April 1984, he piloted Challenger mission STS-41-C, which successfully deployed one satellite and repaired another.|$|R
40|$|The current {{demand in}} {{liquefied}} natural gas (LNG) from re-mote marine locations drives the design of floating LNG (FLNG) liquefaction or regasification facilities, where LNG is transferred to <b>shuttle</b> <b>carriers</b> (LNGC). During the loading procedure, which takes about 18 - 24 hours for a standard sized LNGC, free fluid surfaces and varying filling levels occur inside the internal cargo tanks. This condition is critical since the seakeeping behavior of the LNGC — especially the roll motion — is strongly influ-enced and varying. In order to estimate and forecast the LNGC motions, numerical methods based on potential theory are the most efficient and appropriate method. The selected approach is validated by model tests at 30 % water filling height inside four prismatic tanks. In-depth analyses, including force and mo-ment measurements between tanks and hull, revealed a discrep...|$|R
25|$|Rockwell's Palmdale {{assembly}} {{facility is}} {{where all the}} individual parts, pieces and systems of the Space Shuttle came together and were assembled and tested. Upon completion, the spacecraft {{was turned over to}} NASA for transport overland from Palmdale to Edwards Air Force Base, California. NASA's Dryden Flight Research Facility at Edwards Air Force Base was the site of the mate-demate facility for mating or demating the spacecraft and the <b>shuttle</b> <b>carrier</b> aircraft.|$|E
25|$|On April27, 2012, Norwegian Star {{struck the}} pier where the {{aircraft}} carrier , {{the centerpiece of the}} Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum, was docked while she attempted to dock at the nearby New York Passenger Ship Terminal in Manhattan. Intrepid was, at the time of incident, being prepared for the flyover of the <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft with the Space Shuttle Enterprise later that morning. No injuries were reported and the incident was blamed on high winds and low tide.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} his backup assignment on Apollo 16, Haise {{moved over to}} the Space Shuttle program. In 1977, he participated in the program's Approach and Landing Tests at Edwards Air Force Base. Along with C. Gordon Fullerton as Pilot, Haise as Commander piloted the Space Shuttle Enterprise in free flight to three successful landings after being released from the <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft. These tests successfully verified the shuttle's flight characteristics, an important step toward the overall success of the program.|$|E
40|$|The Space <b>Shuttle</b> {{requires}} <b>carriers</b> {{to support}} payloads {{in the cargo}} bay. As a result, the Mission Peculiar Equipment Support Structure (MPESS) was designed to carry partial payloads aboard the shuttle.

40|$|The Access To Space (ATS) Group at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) {{supports}} {{the science and}} technology community by facilitating frequent and affordable opportunities for access to space. The ATS Group has developed an interactive Mission Design web site that provides both the information and the tools necessary to assist mission planners in selecting and planning their ride to space. The ATS web site was developed through core partnerships with other government agencies seeking similar tools for their mission planners. Key design features of the site include a searchable mission database and launch vehicle toolboxes. The mission database contains a listing of missions ranging from proposed missions to manifested missions allowing users to interactively search for potential partnering opportunities. Missions {{can be added to}} the database by the user community through data input tools. The launch vehicle toolbox section provides the user with a full range of information on vehicle classes and individual configurations. This section has been enhanced to include additional access modes such as RLVs, ultra long duration balloons, sub-orbital rockets, Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>carriers,</b> and spacecraft buses. Use of the ATS web site has climbed 400 % {{in the last six months}} indicating widespread usage across the mission planning community...|$|R
25|$|From 1985 to 2003, Enterprise was {{stored at}} the Smithsonian's hangar at Washington Dulles International Airport {{before it was}} {{restored}} {{and moved to the}} Smithsonian's newly built National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles, where it was the centerpiece of the space collection. On April 12, 2011, NASA announced that , the most traveled orbiter in the fleet, would be added to the collection once the Shuttle fleet was retired. On April 17, 2012, Discovery was transported by <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft to Dulles from Kennedy Space Center, where it made several passes over the Washington D.C. metro area.|$|E
25|$|On September 20, 2009, {{the airport}} {{was used as}} a {{refueling}} stop for the <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft (SCA) piggybacking the Space Shuttle Discovery back to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) from Amarillo after STS-128. The short hops between refueling the SCA were due to the heavy payload still inside the orbiter, specifically the Leonardo (ISS module) that carried wastes from the International Space Station. After refueling, the tandem flew to Barksdale Air Force Base, using most of the runway. This was the last flight of a Space Shuttle between Edwards Air Force Base and Kennedy Space Center; all of the remaining landings of the Shuttle were at KSC.|$|E
25|$|The Space Shuttle was {{originally}} designed to utilize on-board turbofan engines for propulsion within the atmosphere, both upon re-entry and for ferry flights between landing sites, such as Edwards Air Force Base, the White Sands Missile Range, or contingency landing sites such as Easter Island, to the launch site at Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. When the air-breathing engines were deleted from the Shuttle design due to cost and weight concerns, a requirement arose for a transport aircraft capable of carrying the Shuttle from landing sites back to the Kennedy Space Center. One early design for a <b>shuttle</b> <b>carrier</b> aircraft was proposed by John M. Conroy, developer of the Pregnant Guppy and Super Guppy oversized cargo aircraft, {{in cooperation with the}} NASA Langley Research Center; named Virtus, a contract was issued for design and development work in 1974.|$|E

Lately, Kalmar has invested in terminal automation and in energy-efficient container handling.|$|R
25|$|The Virtus {{design was}} {{tested in the}} NASA Langley wind tunnel; while {{the results of the}} wind tunnel tests were {{considered}} promising, the drawbacks of such a large design, including the cost of developing an entirely new aircraft, flight testing the design, and the sheer size of the aircraft requiring the development and/or expansion of infrastructure to support it, militated against further development of Virtus. The Lockheed Corporation, which had proposed a twin-fuselage version of its C-5 Galaxy airlifter to carry the Shuttle, also saw its proposal rejected for the same reasons. A more modest conversion of existing C-5s was proposed, and nearly taken up by NASA, but it was determined that having aircraft continually available was preferable to being restricted by the United States Air Force on the use of C-5s, and Boeing's proposal for a conversion of the 747 airliner was selected, becoming the <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft. A proposed commercial version of the Virtus design, named Colossus, also failed to gain any further interest, and the Virtus design was abandoned.|$|E
500|$|The Approach and Landing Test Programme {{encompassed}} 16 separate {{tests of}} Enterprise, covering taxi tests, unmanned and manned flights on the <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Carrier</b> Aircraft, {{and finally the}} free flight tests.

The first SCA carried the prototype Enterprise during the Approach and Landing Tests in the late 1970s. [...] The two SCA later carried all five operational Space Shuttle orbiters.|$|E
40|$|The current {{demand in}} {{liquefied}} natural gas (LNG) encour-aged the design of various concepts for floating LNG (FLNG) liquefaction or regasification facilities. With increasing trans-port distance, e. g. from remote marine locations to the onshore gas supply net, gas pipelines become uneconomic compared to <b>shuttle</b> <b>carriers</b> for LNG (LNGC). Due to its high energy density, offshore transfer from processing terminals to carriers and from carriers back to receiving terminals has to be analyzed in detail. During the transfer period, free fluid surfaces occurring in the cargo tanks of the LNGC are leading to a significant decrease of the initial intact stability and altered motion behavior. This paper focusses {{on the influence of}} resonant tank sloshing on the LNGC’s roll and surge motions. Analyses of transverse and lon-gitudinal sloshing yield a surprising phenomenon: the frequency shift ∆ω between the theoretical natural frequency of the tank alone and the respective motion peak for a vessel with four tanks mounted to the hull. Force measurements between tank and hull reveal a peak at the tank’s natural frequency that causes strong liquid motions with related forces and moments on the hull but no increased vessel motions. Additional investigations comprise the offloading situation with a multi-body arrangement of LNGC ∗Address all correspondence to these authors. and a FLNG (the MPLS 20 system) in tandem and briefly also in side-by-side configuration.
