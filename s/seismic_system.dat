500|$|To {{support the}} 60 story condo tower, One Rincon Hill South Tower has a massive [...] thick pile-raft {{foundation}} embedded deep into serpentine rock. Although some engineers view serpentine rock with suspicion, there are massive structures, {{such as the}} Golden Gate Bridge, that have foundations on rock that is largely serpentine. Rising out of the foundation are the concrete core and large, tall columns of steel-reinforced concrete called outriggers. The core {{is attached to the}} outrigger columns by diagonal, steel buckling-restrained braces which are designed to dissipate energy during an earthquake through controlled hysteretic behavior. This type of advanced <b>seismic</b> <b>system</b> performs {{in a manner similar to}} that of shock absorbers. The braces are also encased in concrete and steel to further mitigate risk of buckling and strength loss. Also of note is the controlled-rocking system which features vertical post-tensioning which runs the height of the building through ducts within the reinforced-concrete shear-wall core. Many of these technologies used in the One Rincon Hill South Tower have never before been applied in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|ESG's first {{permanent}} <b>seismic</b> <b>system</b> installation {{took place}} at the Retsof Salt Mine in the Genesee Valley near Retsof, New York. In 1994, the Retsof Salt Mine was the largest salt mine in North America, and the second largest in the world. Mining activities had caused the collapse of a 500 by 500 foot piece of the mine ceiling at a depth of 1,200 feet below the surface. The collapse of the shale ceiling rock compromised the caprock layer separating the mine from overlying ground water, and the mine began to flood. The failure caused a magnitude 3.6 earthquake that was felt on the surface, as well as release of natural gases, declining aquifer levels and surface subsidence. [...] An ESG <b>seismic</b> <b>system</b> was installed using boreholes and surface-based sensors to evaluate the integrity of the mine as it flooded and track the sinkhole generated at the surface.|$|E

40|$|We have {{collected}} regional broad-band and densely-spaced short-period data for nearly 40 mining explosions from the Centralia mine, from two rockbursts in northern Idaho, and from several other explosions in the Columbia River Basalt {{and elsewhere in}} Washington state. These recordings, for events with magnitude 2. 5 or larger, are being analyzed to determine {{the characteristics of the}} seismic signals that identify these events as explosions or rockbursts. The type of delayed blasting at the Centralia mine may not be conducive to the detection of spectral scalloping or nulling, and this effect has not been clearly observed in preliminary spectral analyses of the regional seismic signals. However, these and other blasts generate relatively high-amplitude Rayleigh waves (Rg) that allow their identification as explosions at close distances.
