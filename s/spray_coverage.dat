5000|$|Good {{cultural}} practices to prevent pine-pine gall rust include removal of dense patches of grasses, weeds, and brush near susceptible trees, {{as they may}} prevent good <b>spray</b> <b>coverage</b> of the lower whorl (spiraling pattern) of branches. Severely infected trees should be rogued and burned to prevent further spread of inoculum. It {{is often difficult to}} detect infection in trees before symptoms such as stunting, chlorosis, and witches brooming are evident. Until all diseased trees in the area are diagnosed and destroyed it is suggested that a protectant fungicide be applied to all susceptible trees in the stand. Using a registered systemic fungicide such as Bayleton (50% Dry Flowable Fungicide, EPA Reg.

40|$|Abstract Background Malaria control {{programmes}} utilising indoor residual spraying are only effective if a high coverage of targeted structures is achieved and an insecticide that is effective against the specific mosquito vector is correctly applied. Ongoing monitoring of spraying operations {{is essential to}} assure optimal programme performance and early corrective action, where indicated. Methods Successful development and application of a computerised spraying operations management system in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa during 1998 resulted in its adaptation and introduction in neighbouring Maputo Province, southern Mozambique during 2000. The structure and components of this computerised management system are described, and its' operational benefit in southern Mozambique, where community-based spray operators apply intradomiciliary insecticide, are reviewed. Conclusions The computerised management system allowed malaria programme management and field supervisors to monitor <b>spraying</b> <b>coverage,</b> insecticide consumption and application rates on an ongoing basis.

5000|$|The {{spray angle}} diverges or converges {{with respect to}} the {{vertical}} axis. As illustrated in the figure below, the spray angle tends to collapse or diverge with increasing distance from the orifice. <b>Spray</b> <b>coverage</b> varies with spray angle. The theoretical coverage, C, of spray patterns at various distances may be calculated with the equation below for spray angles less than 180 degrees. The spray angle is assumed to remain constant throughout the entire spray distance. Liquids more viscous than water form smaller spray angles, or solid streams, depending upon nozzle capacity, spray pressure, and viscosity. Liquids with surface tensions lower than water produce wider spray angles than those listed for water. Spray angles are typically measured using optical or mechanical methods. The optical methods include shadowgraphy, extinction tomography, and Mie Imaging. [...] Sprays angles are important in coating applications to prevent overspraying of the coated materials, in combustion engines to prevent wetting of the cylinder walls, and in fire sprinklers to provide adequate coverage of the protected property.|$|E

A menor dose do traçador proporcionou uma fluorescência bastante incipiente mesmo para análise visual. As demais folhas foram fotografadas com câmera digital, em ambiente totalmente escuro, sob iluminação ultravioleta. Assim, desenvolveu-se uma rotina de análise de imagens que permitiu a automatização das análises de cobertura.

Three doses of the fluorescent tracer Poliglow 830 YLS (5, 12. 5 and 25 g) were previously mixed to 10 g of a mancozeb formulation, diluted in 5 L of water (0. 001, 0. 0025 e 0. 005 % w. v. of tracer) and applied on Hibiscus spp, with three different sizes of drops (very large, fine and very fine). After the complete drying of the carrier, samples of leaves were collected, taken to the laboratory and analyzed under ultra-violet light, where a leaf was visually selected with light, medium and heavy deposition, for each one of the nine treatments. The smallest dose of the tracer provided a quite incipient fluorescency for visual analysis, therefore being discarded. The other leaves were photographed with digital camera, in a totally dark atmosphere, under ultra-violet illumination. With these images, a routine analysis was developed in the software IDRISI, which allowed the automation of the coverage analyses.

SnapCard allows to predict, measure, and archive pesticide <b>spray</b> <b>coverage</b> quantified from water-sensitive spray cards. Variables include spray settings such as nozzle orifice size, sprayer speed, water carrier rate and adjuvant, and weather variables such as barometric pressure, relative humidity, temperature, and wind speed at ground level. We use separate regression models for four nozzles types. Our results showed that there are strong and positive correlations between water carrier rate and <b>spray</b> <b>coverage</b> for all four nozzle types. Moreover, sprayer speed is highly negatively correlated with obtained <b>spray</b> <b>coverage.</b> In addition, there is no consistent effect of either nozzle type or use of a particular adjuvant, across water carrier intervals.

40|$|ReportThe {{goals of}} this project were to {{identify}} equipment that maximizes <b>spray</b> <b>coverage</b> {{on the underside of}} leaves of cucurbits and to determine if powdery mildew can be controlled effectively with nonsystemic fungicides when coverage is maximized. Conventional nozzles and sprayers deliver little spray material to the underside of leaves. Therefore, growers presently rely on systemic fungicides to control powdery mildew in cucurbits. Fungicide resistance is a major concern because systemic fungicides are at risk for resistance development due to their single-site mode of action and because the powdery mildew fungus has demonstrated high potential for developing resistance. For this project, unfortunately, it was only possible to examine <b>spray</b> <b>coverage</b> because of technical problems with the sprayer. Greater coverage on both leaf surfaces was achieved with the air induction and twin jet nozzles, two novel types for a conventional hydraulic spray boom, than with the traditional flat fan, hollow cone, and cone jet nozzles.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} permethrin-treated plastic sheeting (ITPS) applied as a lining to the ceiling or walls of rooms against pyrethroid-susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles gambiae. Method: Overnight tests were carried out in veranda-trap experimental huts in Vallee du Kou, where two molecular forms of A. gambiae, S and M, occur. The S form is mostly pyrethroid resistant due to the kdr mechanism, and the M form is mostly kdr susceptible. A variety of ITPS covered surfaces were tested, ranging from ceiling only to all walls plus ceiling covered. Results: ITPS had a major effect on the mortality of mosquitoes, the proportion killed being dependent upon the surface area covered. Homozygotes for kdr resistance showed lower rates of mortality than did heterozygotes or homozygotes for susceptibility. Deterred entry of mosquitoes and inhibition of blood feeding were also correlated with surface area covered. The mode of action and efficacy of ITPS seems to bear closer resemblance to that induced by indoor residual spraying (IRS) than to that induced by insecticide-treated nets. Conclusions: ITPS might be conceived as being equivalent to long-lasting or permanent IRS but without some of the operational constraints normally associated with <b>spraying.</b> High <b>coverage</b> of ITPS could potentially have a mass population effect on mosquitoes and give rise to long-term community protection against malaria.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAlthough many malaria control {{programmes}} in sub-Saharan Africa use indoor residual spraying with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), {{the two studies}} assessing {{the benefit of the}} combination of these two interventions gave conflicting results. We aimed to assess whether the addition of indoor residual spraying to LLINs provided a significantly different level of protection against clinical malaria in children or against house entry by vector mosquitoes. MethodsIn this two-arm cluster, randomised, controlled efficacy trial we randomly allocated clusters of Gambian villages using a computerised algorithm to LLINs alone (n= 35) or indoor residual spraying with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane plus LLINs (n= 35). In each cluster, 65 – 213 children, aged 6 months to 14 years, were surveyed {{at the start of the}} 2010 transmission season and followed in 2010 and 2011 by passive case detection for clinical malaria. Exposure to parasite transmission was assessed by collection of vector mosquitoes with both light and exit traps indoors. Primary endpoints were the incidence of clinical malaria assessed by passive case detection and number of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes collected per light trap per night. Intervention teams had no role in data collection and the data collection teams were not informed of the spray status of villages. The trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN 01738840. FindingsLLIN coverage in 2011 was 3510 (93 %) of 3777 children in the indoor residual spraying plus LLIN group and 3622 (95 · 5 %) of 3791 in the LLIN group. In 2010, 7845 children were enrolled, 7829 completed passive case detection, and 7697 (98 %) had complete clinical and covariate data. In 2011, 7009 children remained in the study, 648 more were enrolled, 7657 completed passive case detection, and 7545 (98 · 5 %) had complete data. Indoor residual <b>spraying</b> <b>coverage</b> per cluster was more than 80 % for both years in the indoor residual spraying plus LLIN group. Incidence of clinical malaria was 0 · 047 per child-month at risk in the LLIN group and 0 · 044 per child-month at risk in the indoor residual spraying plus LLIN group in 2010, and 0 · 032 per child-month at risk in the LLIN group and 0 · 034 per child-month at risk in the indoor residual spraying plus LLIN group in 2011. The incident rate ratio was 1 · 08 (95 % CI 0 · 80 – 1 · 46) controlling for confounders and cluster by mixed-effect negative binomial regression on all malaria attacks for both years. No significant difference was recorded in the density of vector mosquitoes caught in light traps in houses over the two transmission seasons; the mean number of A gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes per trap per night was 6 · 7 (4 · 0 – 10 · 1) in the LLIN group and 4 · 5 (2 · 4 – 7 · 4) in the indoor residual spraying plus LLIN group (p= 0 · 281 in the random-effects linear regression model). InterpretationWe identified no significant difference in clinical malaria or vector density between study groups.

Methods included calculation of annual blood examination rates (ABER, number of slides examined/population), collection of water specimens from potential vector-breeding sites, sorting of villages in categories depending {{on the number of}} abandoned wells within two kilometers radius and review of the DDT <b>spray</b> <b>coverage.</b> Cases were compared with matched neighbourhood controls in terms of personal protection using matched odds ratios (MOR). 7, 303 cases and 17 deaths were reported between April 2005 and March 2006 with a peak during October rains (Attack rate: 50 per 1, 000, case fatality: 0. 2 %). The attack rate increased according to the number of abandoned wells within 2 kilometres radius (P < 0. 0001, Chi-square for trend). Abandoned wells were Anopheles breeding sites. Compared with controls, cases were more likely to sleep outdoors (MOR: 3. 8) and less likely to use of mosquito nets and repellents (MOR: 0. 3 and 0. 1, respectively). DDT <b>spray</b> <b>coverage</b> and ABER were 39 % and 3. 5 %, below the recommended 85 % and 10 %, respectively. Overall, this outbreak resulted from weaknesses in malaria control measures and a combination of factors, including vector breeding, low implementation of personal protection and weak case detection...|$|E
40|$|A two-site, two-year field {{application}} experiment investigated fungicide {{coverage in}} a fully-developed soybean canopy. Application treatments included “high-rate” (187 l/ha; 20 gal/acre) and “low-rate” (112 l/ha; 12 gal/acre) with fine-droplet two-orifice tips, medium-droplet two-orifice tip at 187 l/ha (20 gal/acre), a coarse-droplet single-orifice “herbicide-style” tip at 168 l/ha (18 gal/ac), and an air-assisted <b>spray</b> treatment. Droplet <b>coverage</b> and size, and foliar disease severity in the lower, middle, and top {{parts of the}} plant canopy, and crop yield were measured. Droplet size generally followed expected manufacturer specifications. Percentage area covered and drops/cm 2 were significantly less in lower parts of the plant canopy (1 – 8 %) than in the canopy top (15 – 18 %). Coverage was affected less by application treatment and differences observed in pooled data from all canopy locations were mixed. Although smaller droplets usually produced increased drops/cm 2, percentage coverage did not always increase. In the second year coverage improved with medium droplets. Foliar disease pressure was light so that yield or disease severity was little affected by application method or as compared to a check area without application...|$|R
40|$|When {{assessing}} {{the quality of}} the spraying procedure, three indicators are used: uneven distribution of precipitation of liquid <b>sprayed,</b> degree of <b>coverage</b> of <b>sprayed</b> surfaces, and deposition of liquid spraying However, {{there is a lack of}} information on the relationship between the quality parameters of the procedure. Therefore, the research was carried out at the Institute of Agricultural Engineering of Wrocław University of Environmental and Life Sciences. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between the degree of <b>coverage</b> of <b>sprayed</b> surfaces and the deposition of liquid in the aspect of the parametric characteristics of the protected plant using selected single and double stream nozzles. Experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions. The carrier of nozzles acted as an independent self-propelled sprayer used for spraying, whereas the parametric characteristics of plants were determined using artificial plants as the ratio of the vertical projection surface and the horizontal projection surface. The results and their analysis showed a strong and very strong correlation between the analyzed parameters in terms of the characteristics of the sprayed object...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} nine {{experiments}} to study factors influencing {{the efficacy of}} N- (phosphonomethyl) glycine (as Roundup) in killing sugarcane are reported. These factors include varying rates, methods of application, disturbance of the cane after application, the presence of dew on the foliage during application and the susceptibility of sugarcane varieties. Other factors such as season, soil type and stage of cane growth were also considered. Ten litres per hectare consistently produced the best kill. Band sprays were superior to overall <b>sprays</b> when the <b>coverage</b> was adequate. Low volume applications were marginally superior to high volume applications. Disturbance of the cane one day after treatment only affected the kill very slightly under favourable conditions, while dew {{had no effect on}} cane kill. Varieties differed in their susceptibility but at 11, 2 Iitres per hectare all varieties tested were adequately killed. The kill was unacceptable in all experiments where cane was sprayed in winter. Cane growing on light soils was more susceptible to treatment than cane growing on heavy soils. The stage of cane growth had a marked effect on the kill achieved...|$|R
