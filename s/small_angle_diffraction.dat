40|$|When two {{coherent}} red beams (lambda = 632. 8 nm) are coupled in bacteriorhodopsin (bR) {{film with}} a <b>small</b> <b>angle,</b> <b>diffraction</b> beams occur. The diffraction intensities {{as a function}} of exposure time are quite different for different incident intensities. With low incident intensity, the diffraction intensity rises from zero to a maximum value as exposure time increasing. Conversely, for the higher incident intensity, the diffraction intensity increases from zero to maximum value and then decays till it tends to be a stable value. We found that the incident intensity which is corresponding to the maximum diffraction efficiency in a stable state is an optimal intensity, while incident intensity is lower than it, the dynamic diffraction intensities have no an overshooting peak; and if incident intensity is higher than it, an overshooting peak occurs in the diffraction intensities.

The time {{course of this}} dynamic molecular process was analyzed quantitatively {{with the help of}} model calculations based on the amino acid sequence. The results show that two mechanisms contribute to the elongation of fibrils, namely the stretching of the collagen triple helices and their sliding relative to each other (increase of the D stagger). The results further show that these two processes do not take place simultaneously. The first increase of the D period from 67. 0 nm to about 67. 6 nm is correlated with a stretching of the triple helices. The further increase of the D period is due to a continuous increase of the D stagger. This succession is independent of the age of the animals and also independent of the stretching velocity. The stretching process is shown to be reversible at the molecular level up to a D period of about 68. 4 nm...|$|E

Optimization of processing parameters (i. e. amplitude, force and time) was crucial to obtain nanocomposites without any evidence of degradation, high material saving and short processing time (7 – 8 s). Good dispersion of nanotubes was achieved after processing previously formed solvent casting films. This dispersion was even partially detected in pieces directly obtained from powder mixtures of both components. Incorporation of MWCNTs had a remarkable influence on melting and crystallization processes, which were systematically studied by time resolved synchrotron experiments. Results indicated higher melting and crystallization temperatures for the nanocomposite, with temperature differences higher than 5 °C.

40|$|Samples {{of turkey}} tendon at {{different}} degree of calcification {{have been investigated}} by high and small angle X-ray diffraction techniques using conventional and synchrotron radiation sources. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>small</b> <b>angle</b> <b>diffraction</b> patterns of samples at a degree of calcification ranging from 20 to 60 % wt are due to the apatite phase which fits in the main band of collagen fibrils and exhibits the same axial D-periodicity, 67. 0 nm, as native collagen fibrils in either wet or air-dried conditions. Analysis of these patterns reveals that the mineral phase is deposited along the collagen fibrils according to a step function. The length of the step is 0. 46 D independent of the degree of calcification, while the height of the step increases with increasing calcification. The shift of the high angle equatorial diffraction spacing from 1. 42 to 1. 24 nm when the inorganic phase content passes from 40 to 60 % wt suggests that needle-shaped crystals which compress the molecules are preferentially deposited during the advanced stages of calcification, in agreement with previuos electron microscopy observations.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 91 - 101). This work {{focuses on the}} adaptation of molten salt assisted self-assembly (MASA) method for the synthesis and characterization of mesoporous LiCoO 2 and LiMn 2 O 4 materials without a polymerizing agent in the media. The MASA process is a new method to synthesize mesoporousthin films and monoliths. Fresh gel and calcined solid samples were characterized by using XRD, Raman, N 2 sorption, FTIR POM, SEM, TEM and UV-Vis measurements. The first step of the process involves the preparation of clear solutions that contain two hydrated salts, LiNO 3. xH 2 O and Co(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O (or Mn(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O), CTAB (cethyltrimethylammonium bromide, ionic surfactant) (or CTAN), 10 - lauryl ether (C 12 EO 10, ionic surfactant) and ethanol (or H 2 O) as volatile solvents. Additionally, HNO 3 is needed {{in the case of}} LiMn 2 O 4 to prevent formation of [Mn(OH) 2 (H 2 O) 4](s) complex during and/or before the assembly process. The clear solutions are spin coated over various substrates to produce the salt-surfactant LLC mesophase that resists to high temperature treatments (300 - 550 oC) in air to form first examples of mesoporous metal lithiates. Thesis is designed to give the insights on how to change several parameters that control the features like purity, pore size, surface area and crystallinity of the LiCoO 2 and LiMn 2 O 4 mesostructures by determining solvent type, thickness of the LLC film, acid amount, salt uptake, calcination temperature, calcination time and surfactant used for the synthesis. Ethanol was determined to be a good solvent to prepare the clear solutions. The samples, prepared by spin coating gave better results than the ones prepared by drop casting to obtain uniform pores with less side products. Addition of HNO 3 has no effect on side product formation in the synthesis of LiCoO 2 but it is vital to obtain a stable, homogenous solution in the case of LiMn 2 O 4 preparation. LiCoO 2 samples, prepared using CTAB are semicrystalline at lower temperatures and stable up to 550 oC but it undergoes decomposition to Co 3 O 4 and Li 2 O at higher temperatures. Presence of CTAB in the reaction media has a positive effect on the uniformity pores. However; due to the role of Brion on formation of side products, CTAN has been used for further experimentation. Thin films of the calcined samples showed <b>small</b> <b>angle</b> <b>diffraction</b> corresponds to preserved order of the mesophase during calcination.

Recently, much effort has been put into separating carbon dioxide (CO 2) from flue gases linked to the combustion processes at fixed point sources. The development of solid sorbents for adsorption based on CO 2 capture has attracted much attention. Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) materials have recently attracted much attention as solid adsorbents for capturing CO 2. OMS have been investigated for this purpose owing to their high pore volume, large surface area and ease of functionalizationIn this work we report on the synthesis of OMS viz. MCM- 41 and SBA- 15 along with amorphous silica as adsorbents for CO 2 capture. MCM- 41 was prepared with surfactants having different alkyl chain lengths (C 14 TABr, C 16 TABr and C 18 TABr) where TABr is trimethylammonium bromide. SBA- 15 was prepared using a Triblock copolymer as a structure directing agent for the organization of polymerizing silica species. Commercial amorphous silica gel was used for comparative purposes. Initial characterization OMS with powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and <b>small</b> <b>angle</b> <b>diffraction</b> (SAXS) yielded diffraction patterns which may be associated with well-ordered structures of hexagonal mesoporous material. Ease of preparation for MCM- 41 materials allowed for convenient scale- up, obtaining highly ordered mesoporous silica MCM- 41 at room temperature. SBA- 15 was also found to be scaled up with considerable ease through increasing the volume of the autoclave during hydrothermal treatment. Structural, morphological and textural properties of the adsorbents were characterized by N 2 physisorption measurements, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). TEM confirmed the hexagonal structure; SEM showed that C 14 MCM- 41 had spheroidal particle morphology whereas SBA- 15 displayed rod-like structures. High surface areas of up to 1302, 1186, 1211 and 1024 m 2 /g for C 14 MCM- 41, C 16 MCM- 41, C 18 MCM- 41 and SBA- 15, respectively were obtained. The pore size of MCM- 41 materials was increased from 2. 6 nm for C 14 MCM- 41 to 4. 4 nm in diameter for C 18 MCM- 41 using surfactants with different alkyl chain lengths. CO 2 adsorption characteristics of OMS were studied using CO 2 -temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The results showed that C 14 MCM- 41, C 16 MCM- 41, C 18 MCM- 41 and SBA- 15 desorbed 0. 19, 0. 16, 0. 11 and 0. 26 mmol/g respectively. The synthesized OMS were then further modified by grafting various amine moieties on their surfaces in order to increase their CO 2 adsorptive capabilities. 3 -(Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APS), N-[3 -(trimethoxysilyl) propyl]ethylene- diamine (TPED), 3 -chloropropyl) -trimethoxysilane (CPS), ethyl 2 -bromopropanoate, tris(2 -aminoethyl) amine (TREN) and guanidine. Several characterization techniques such as XRD, SAXS, HRTEM, HRSEM, TGA, Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, CO 2 isotherms and CO 2 -TPD were used to analyze amine grafted solid sorbents for CO 2 capture. The results revealed that the structural integrity of the amine modified sorbents was not compromised during the grafting process. The structural properties of the supports, such as surface area and pore size, nature of amine and the number of amine groups, affected the loading and CO 2 adsorption capacity of chemically grafted sorbents. APS grafted amorphous silica gel adsorbed 0. 67 mmol/g CO 2, which proved to be the highest compared to C 18 MCM- 41 and SBA- 15 grafted with APS and TPED. C 18 MCM- 41, SBA- 15 and amorphous silica gel were also grafted with TREN and adsorbed 0. 42, 0. 51 and 0. 27 mmol/g of CO 2, respectively. A systematic study of guanidine grafted on C 14 MCM- 41, C 16 MCM- 41 and C 18 MCM- 41 was investigated, for the first time, {{to the best of our}} knowledge. Structural properties like variation in pore size, proved to enhance the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent, coupled with the guanidine molecules grafted on MCM- 41 materials. C 18 MCM- 41 -guanidine showed the highest CO 2 uptake of the guanidine grafted MCM- 41 materials, adsorbing 0. 30 mmol/g. A novel synthetic route to TPED-TREN grafted C 18 MCM- 41 and SBA- 15, using ethyl 2 -bromopropanoate as a linker, was investigated as a potential adsorbent for CO 2 capture, for the first time. C 18 MCM- 41 -TPED-TREN and SBA- 15 -TPED-TREN CO 2 adsorption capacity were found to be 0. 14 and 0. 14 mmol/g, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Metal/silicon {{multilayer}} structures used in microelectronics and optics for soft X-ray region include nano-sized layers. Therefore {{study of}} solid state diffusion {{at the early}} stages in these structures {{is the key to}} understanding their properties. Luckily the multilayer structures, being one-dimensional artificial crystals, appear to be convenient model systems for investigation of diffusion processes. <b>Small</b> <b>angle</b> X-ray <b>diffraction</b> from their interfaces is very sensitive to the smallest changes in the structure. Using X-ray diffraction applied in situ during thermal annealing of Mo/Si structures we investigated diffusion phenomena on picometer length scale and revealed remarkable evolution of diffusion characteristics during the interface growth...|$|R
40|$|We have {{synthesized}} a {{homologous series}} of 4 -(4 -alkoxyphenoxycarbonyl) phenyl 4 -trifluoromethylbenzoates (compounds 1) and examined their thermal properties and molecular arrangements. The transition temperatures, the latent heats and the characterizations of the mesophases were achieved by polarizing microscope, DSC, and <b>small</b> <b>angle</b> X-ray <b>diffraction</b> measurements. These homologous series of 1 show nematic, smectic A and/or highly ordered smectic phases. The layer spacings of the smectic A phases {{indicate that the}} each layer spacing of the homologs is about 2 Å longer than the molecular length. These {{results indicate that the}} trifluoromethyl group is located at the boundary of the smectic walls...|$|R
40|$|Quasi-binary (QB) {{picture of}} thermotropics, which regards a neat thermotropic liquid crystal as a binary system {{consisting}} of (semi) rigid core and molten alkyl chain, was assessed experimentally {{for the most}} famous (and representative) thermotropic mesogenic series nCB. By adding n-heptane as solvent, the smectic A phase was induced in 7 CB–n-heptane system. <b>Small</b> <b>angle</b> x-ray <b>diffraction</b> showed that the QB picture holds {{not only in the}} phase behavior but also in the structure. It is suggested that the melting of 8 CB and 9 CB to isotropic liquid via smectic and nematic liquid crystals can be understood as a thermotropic–lyotropic crossover...|$|R
