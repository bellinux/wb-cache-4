5|$|Benefitting {{from the}} advent of postcards, Mary Willumsen (1884–1961) photographed women in scanty {{clothing}} or nude at the Helgoland beach facility in Copenhagen. Between 1916 and 1920, she took many such photographs which she <b>sold</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> nearby kiosk. The operation was discontinued when the police began to take an interest. Many of the compositions are now considered to have considerable artistic merit.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years after}} its release in 1997, Final Fantasy Tactics was {{selected}} {{as part of the}} Sony Greatest Hits line of rereleases.

5|$|A {{total of}} 100,058 Illinois Centennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during August 1918, with the excess over the round number {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1919 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. There was no official packaging; a few were used in badges for the Illinois Centennial Commission. The coins were not publicized much outside Illinois. The centennial commission distributed them, at face value, to its county affiliates in proportion to their share of Illinois' population, on condition they be <b>sold</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> premium {{to help pay for}} local celebrations, and if one had already been held, for war relief.|$|E
5|$|An Adventurous Automobile Trip premiered at {{the gala}} opening {{night of the}} Folies Bergère revue on 31 December 1904. It ran for six months at the Folies Bergère, lasting more than 300 performances. Méliès also {{intended}} for the film to be shown by exhibitors elsewhere, outside {{the context of the}} revue. Thus, after its Folies Bergère run, it was released as a standalone item by Méliès's Star Film Company and numbered 740–749 in its catalogues, where it is advertised as a grande course fantastique funambulesque. As with at least fourpercent of Méliès's output, the film was available both in black-and-white and in individually hand-colored prints <b>sold</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> higher price.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the release of Mughal-e-Azam, a typical Bollywood film would garner a {{distribution}} fee of 300,000–400,000 (about US$63,000–84,000 in 1960) per territory. Asif insisted that he would sell his film to the distributors at no less than 700,000 per territory. Subsequently, the film was actually <b>sold</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> price of 1.7million (US$356,000) per territory, surprising Asif and the producers. Thus, it set the record for the highest distribution fee received by any Bollywood film at that time.|$|E

5|$|In 1875, the {{partially}} constructed railway was <b>sold</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> sheriff's sale after the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Latrobe terminus of the line, declined to assume financial responsibility. Thomas Mellon, a retired Court of Common Pleas judge from Allegheny County, purchased the Ligonier Valley Railroad at auction. Mellon had founded the T. Mellon and Sons Bank, and was invested in coal, steel, oil, glassmaking, and other railroad ventures. In {{an effort to}} attract passengers, Mellon decided to offer recreational grounds along the route.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, a {{deputation}} led by Lord Shaftesbury {{was made}} to the Great Eastern Railway and Great Northern Railway, proposing that for trains due to arrive in central London prior to 8am, third class tickets should be <b>sold</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> fare of 3d providing the return journey was not made before 4pm. By May 1885 both railways had adopted this policy. However, the delays and uncertainty caused by the fares dispute had discouraged prospective tenants, leaving large numbers of properties vacant and causing further building work to slow considerably. In 1887, construction work was temporarily suspended altogether, {{in response to the}} large backlog of un-let properties.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the dam project also {{arose in}} {{concern of the}} dam's cost. Several United States congressmen and fiscal conservatives protested the {{proposal}} {{on the grounds that}} the money that would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed to the lack of existing infrastructure in the region and said it was unlikely that enough electricity generated by the dam could be <b>sold</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> high enough price to pay for its construction.|$|E

The character of Rover the dog, played by Hepworth's family dog Blair, became a household name and is considered the world's first canine film star. This first appearance of a dog in a narrative based film caused the uncommon name of Rover to become popular for dogs.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} by Apple on September 10, 2013 with {{the announcement of}} its successors, the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. While the 5C shared almost the same internal hardware as the iPhone 5, the 5C used a lower-cost poly-carbonate plastic case {{in place of the}} original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5C deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone model would remain in production, but <b>sold</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> lower price point below the new model.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} adults owning shares rose from 7 per cent to 25 per cent during her tenure, {{and more than a}} million {{families}} bought their council houses, giving an increase from 55 per cent to 67 per cent in owner occupiers from 1979 to 1990. The houses were <b>sold</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> discount of 33–55 per cent, leading to large profits for some new owners. Personal wealth rose by 80 per cent in real terms during the 1980s, mainly due to rising house prices and increased earnings. Shares in the privatised utilities were sold below their market value to ensure quick and wide sales, rather than maximise national income.|$|E

In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls <b>sold</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time. SpongeBob has gained popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom purposefully targeted marketing at {{women in the}} country as a method of building the SpongeBob SquarePants brand. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan as the character's design is very different from already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu. The character also spawned a soap-filled sponge product manufactured by SpongeTech.|$|E

5|$|A 2001 {{article in}} the Star Tribune noted that Plato's Closet in 2001 stocked up on brand names like Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap Inc., Silver Jeans Co., Sean John, Express, Inc., and Dr. Martens that they <b>sold</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{markdown}} of between 50% and 75%. Unlike consignment shops, Plato's Closet pays sellers on the spot. Used clothes are purchased at between 30% and 40% of what Plato's Closet intends to sell them at. According to a 2002 article in Winston-Salem Journal, Winmark spent around $67,000 for each television advertisement for Plato's Closet. In a 2009 interview with Star Tribune, CEO John Morgan said Plato's Closet did the best during the Great Recession among Winmark's franchises because people {{were more likely to}} sell used clothing to make money and to buy used clothing to save money.|$|E
