40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{combined}} method for 222 Rn measurement in air based on {{liquid scintillation counting}} (LSC) is proposed. It is an integral and a highly sensitive method, capable for different 222 Rn measurement applications. The first method {{is based on a}} charcoal trapping. The second method (Kaihola et al. 1992; Kaihola 1996) is based on a plastic scintillation material (MeltilexTM) -coated <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial.</b> This method is a <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial</b> method for 222 Rn measurements like the Lucas cham-ber method. Both methods utilize modern LSC techniques and PTFE vials. One essential aim was to perform in situ calibra-tion of the charcoal-based method for any weather conditions. We tested the method on both a Quantulus 1220 and a Triathler counter. The corresponding sensitivity is ~ 0. 1 cpm per Bq m− 3 for 1 day of exposure...|$|E
30|$|PHA homopolymers were {{extracted}} from residual dried cell {{samples from the}} LSBJ and RSC 02 biosynthesis experiments by combining each set of triplicate samples into single 10  mL pressure vials (Kimax), adding 6  mL of chloroform, and incubating at 100  °C for 1  h. Each sample was filtered through a 0.45  μm PTFE syringe filter (Restek) into a 20  mL <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial</b> and rinsed twice with 2  mL aliquots of chloroform. Samples were concentrated to relative dryness using a rotary evaporator, and redissolved in 1  mL chloroform. Crude polymers were purified by non-solvent precipitation in cold methanol as described previously (Pinto et al. 2016), with several modifications. Briefly, dissolved samples were added dropwise to 10  mL of ice-cold methanol (4  °C) with rapid stirring. The solution was centrifuged (3452 ×g, 30  min, 4  °C) to pellet the PHA, decanted and washed with an additional 5  mL of methanol, and re-centrifuged. The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet dissolved in approximately 2  mL of chloroform to transfer to a <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial.</b> Samples were concentrated in a rotary evaporator, and evaporated to dryness under high vacuum for 4  h.|$|E

40|$|The {{morphogenesis}} of the Drosophila embryonic heart tube {{has emerged}} as a valuable model system for studying cell migration, cell-cell adhesion and cell shape changes during embryonic development. One of the challenges faced in studying this structure is that the lumen of the heart tube, as well as the membrane features that are crucial to heart tube formation, are difficult to visualize in whole mount embryos, due to the small size of the heart tube and intra-lumenal space relative to the embryo. The use of transmission electron microscopy allows for higher magnification of these structures and gives the advantage of examining the embryos in cross section, which easily reveals {{the size and shape of}} the lumen. In this video, we detail the process for reliable fixation, embedding, and sectioning of late stage Drosophila embryos in order to visualize the heart tube lumen as well as important cellular structures including cell-cell junctions and the basement membrane. Protocol 1.

30|$|For the {{particle}} size reduction, a bench scale wet milling devise was developed {{as described by}} Chiang et al. [13].

40|$|In a {{recently}} developed, two-compartment liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial,</b> {{the evolution of}} UC 02 resulting from bacterial metabolism of uniformly la-beled d-glucose was measured sensitively, cumulatively, and automatically in a liquid-scintillation counter.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Recently, we {{developed}} a simple method to determine the activity of 109 Cd by means of liquid scintillation spectrometry using commercial counters.

The main idea of these studies is to improve the counting efficiency, and thus to optimize the energy resolution of measured spectra. The studies comprise comparisons of various liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>vials,</b> e. g. glass vials, glass vials covered with adhesive tape, etched glass vials, sandblasted glass vials, and polyethylene (PE) vials.

40|$|The {{movement}} of soil fumigants through plastic mulch films following soil fumigation {{is of interest}} because reducing film permeability may result in increased efficacy and reduced emissions. Low-density or high-density polyethylene films (LDPE or HDPE) were reported to be permeable to soil fumigants, while virtually impermeable films (VIF) were shown to greatly reduce {{movement of}} these fumigants (Papiernik and Yates 2001). Although VIF reduces permeability and improves efficacy of fumigants (Gilreath and Chellemi 1998, Noling et al. 2001), it has not met with widespread grower acceptance {{for a number of}} reasons, primarily higher cost and poor handling characteristics. As a result, there is still a need to identify films and/or coatings for polyethylene films that will reduce movement of fumigants, but will not be as costly or difficult to handle. The method reported here was developed as a quick, simple, and inexpensive way to detect differences in film permeability. The test chamber used is shown in Fig. 1.

40|$|Heavy metals {{often occur}} as co-contaminants with {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and reportedly have adverse effects on biodegradation. In this study, the development of C- 14 -phenanthrene mineralisation in soil co-contaminated with aged or freshly added Al or Fe amendment was assessed. C- 14 -phenanthrene mineralisation was assessed using respirometry; respirometers incorporated a Teflon-lined screw-capped CO 2 trap containing 1 -M NaOH within a glass <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial.</b> The production of (CO 2) -C- 14 was assessed {{by the addition of}} Ultima Gold liquid scintillation fluid to the CO 2 traps and subsequent liquid scintillation counting. Enumeration of phenanthrene-degrading bacteria was achieved by counting the colony forming unit count using the spread plate method. This investigation considered the effects of Al and Fe (50, 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg) on C- 14 -phenanthrene biodegradation in soil over 63 -day contact time. Fresh Al amendments at lower concentrations (50 and 100 mg/kg) stimulated phenanthrene catabolism (p < 0. 05) at t = 21 and 42 days which may reflect an 'Arndt-Schulz' effect, but phenanthrene catabolism was significantly reduced (p < 0. 05) in 500 mg/kg aged Al this could be due to Al toxicity to phenanthrene degraders. Phenanthrene mineralisation was stimulated in the highest Fe concentration (500 mg/kg) in aged and fresh Fe amendments at t = 21 days. This could be because Fe is an essential requirement for microbial growth. The impact of Al or Fe on the catabolism of C- 14 -phenanthrene was dependent on incubation time and Al was more toxic than Fe to soil PAH catabolic activity. This could be because Al is a non-essential microbial requirement. Bioremediation of soils co-contaminated with PAH and heavy metal is a complex problem; therefore, studies on the impact of metals on PAHs biodegradation highlight the risks and biodegradation potential in contaminated soil...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Bacterial {{bioluminescence}} {{has been}} postulated {{to be an}} adaptation to physical environments of low oxygen concentration {{as well as an}} adaptation to the biotic environment. The in vivo luminescence of cultures of luminescent bacteria grown under microaerobic conditions had apparently not been investigated previously. I conducted experiments in which in vivo luminescence emitted by microaerobic cultures of Photobacterium phosphoreum was monitored non-destructively. I found luminescence oscillated under these conditions. The cause of luminous oscillations was sought for three reasons. First, biochemical and biophysical mechanisms responsible for generating long-period oscillations are controversial, and some models deny the capability for such oscillations to prokaryotes. Second, the hypothesis that luminescence adapts bacteria to low oxygen environments had apparently only been tested on cultures grown with oxygenation. Third, interpretation of temporal changes of luminescence is important for the adaption of sequential luminescent analysis to bioassays based on this easily quantified biochemical product. Methods: In vivo luminescence was measured non-destructively by growing cultures of P. phosphoreum in sterile scintillation vials. The study of other factors relevant to in vivo luminescence was done on parallel cultures. Parallel cultures were derived from the same flask of inoculated media, and were treated treated similarly afterward. This allowed the concomitant study of several variables under undisturbed microaerobiosis. Experiments were of two types. In the first type, coincident temporal structure of luminescence and other parameters was sought by parallel measurements. In the second type of experiment, perturbations were applied to cultures and their effects on subsequent luminous oscillations were examined. Results: Luminous oscillations do not seem to share a common etiology. The first luminous peak was relatively resistant to the effects of nutrition, media conditioned by previous growth of this bacterium, and to the protein synthesis inhibitors chloramphenicol and puromycin. The amplitude, but not the timing of this peak was affected by pargyline. The timing, but not the amplitude of this peak was affected by aldehyde perturbation. Later luminous peaks were labile to factors that the first peak was resistant to, as well as resistant to the aldehyde perturbation that the first luminous peak was labile to. Microaerobiosis apparently increased in vivo luminescence emitted by cultures during the first 24 hours of observation. The first peak of in vivo luminescence occurs after a time span similar to that required for oxygen content to reach a minimum in microaerobic cultures of P. phosphoreum. An abrupt increase in luciferase synthesis also occurs after a similar lag time. Luminescent peaks after the first may be reduced in amplitude and slowed in periodicity by changing the conditions within <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial</b> cultures so that oxygen content is increased. Conclusions: The most likely etiology for the first luminous peak is that pre-existing luciferase is expressed by relief of aldehyde limitation. Subsequent luminous peaks are labile to many factors. One hypothesis consistent with observations in this work is that availability of FMNH??? from the microbial metabolism exerts control over in vivo luminescence. In low oxygen conditions, considerable control of in vivo luminescence seems to be exercised independently of both luciferase content and the concentration of bacteria in a culture. The temporal similarity between the time required to reach minimum oxygen content, the time before the first luminous peak, and the time before a burst of luciferase synthesis occurs in microaerobic cultures may support the hypothesis that luminescence is functionally significant in low-oxygen conditions. This {{is based on the assumption}} that both in vivo luminescence and de novo synthesis of luciferase are linked to environmental conditions having functional significance for luminescence. Automated sequential luminescence monitoring may be a useful tool for bioassays. Luminous oscillations may be minimized by appropriate conditions within <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial</b> cultures. The non-destructive nature of such measurements allows the collection of data on in vivo biochemical events. Lability of luminescence to nutritional factors suggests use as a bioassay for nutrients. In my latest work, I have used the reversion of a dim mutant of this strain of P. phosphoreum to wild-type luminescence as the basis of an assay for mutagenic substances...|$|E
40|$|The {{irrigation}} site {{located at}} the University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center was designed to support controlled irrigation {{through the use of}} evenly spaced drip tubing under a heavy black plastic tarp. Soil solution samplers (lysimeters) are placed at specific locations to collect water from 1. 5 meters, 3. 0 meters and 10 meters from the soil surface. Suction provided by a vacuum pump was applied to the lysimeters for three hours prior to collection. After this time, the soil solution, if any was collected and placed into 20 ml HDPE <b>scintillation</b> <b>vials</b> and stored at - 15 C for later analysis. These samples were analyzed for pH with a Ross Sure Flow Combination Electrode. Electrical conductivity for each sample was measured with the use of an Accumet Conductivity Cell. Both electrodes were connected to an Accumet Model 50 pH/ion/conductivity meter. High Performance Liquid Chromatography was employed in an attempt to determine the amount of Biosurfactant present in each sample. Our HPLC equipment includes a 5 mm x 15 mm CIS chromatography column, Waters 2487 detector, 510 pump, and WISP 710 Auto Injector. Millennium software was used to integrate data from these analyses...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{investigating}} the binding of imipramine to soluble cellular fractions from brain and leukocytes using equillibrium dialysis, an artifactual binding component was produced. On Scatchard and double-reciprocal plots of the data, the component appeared as a homogeneous population of sites displaying a binding affinity of 170 nM. The obtained pattern of biphasic interaction bore a marked resemblance to reported Scatchard plots representing the interaction of drugs with bovine serum albumin,and depicting two components of widely differing binding affinity and capacity. The artifact occurred when solutions were transferred after dialysis and before quantitation to intermediate containers, and resulted from binding of H-imirpramine to the walls of these containers. The latter interaction decreased the concentration of radiolabeled drug in the dialusate {{but not in the}} dialyzed solution, and thus mimicked increased imipramine binding to the biological material under study. The effect was particularly pronounced at low drug concentrations, and was prevented by the presence of either proteinaceous material, or of an excess of another basic compound such as methadone. The concentration dependence of the phenomenon led to its appearance as a discrete binding component. The artifact was eliminated either by applying an appropriate correction factor, or by transferring the dialyzed solutions directly into <b>scintillation</b> <b>vials</b> for counting...|$|R
30|$|Figure 2 c, d shows {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} images of calcium-crosslinked NALG and NALG-DOX. Both types of nanoparticles displayed spherical morphology. The general distribution of nanoparticles appeared to be similar in size to the DLS distribution. The concentration of the final NALG-DOX {{solution was evaluated using}} the intrinsic fluorescence of the doxorubicin molecule. The volume of the filtered NALG-DOX product was divided up into triplicate sets of dialysis devices placed into PBS-filled <b>scintillation</b> <b>vials</b> and DOX was allowed various times to release from the NALG-DOX. Initially, the concentration of DOX in the NALG-DOX solution was ~[*][*] 4  μg/mL, indicating that the encapsulation efficiency, or ratio of DOX in NALG-DOX to initial DOX added to formulation, for the NALG-DOX is ~[*] 7 %. While this encapsulation efficiency is considered low compared to similar particles [57], this is likely due to the initial DOX present in the aqueous phase. We did not iterate on the formulation by lowering the amount of DOX present in the initial aqueous phase and hypothesize that the efficiency could be improved by lowering the amount of DOX in the initial formulation. The unencapsulated DOX is likely passing through the 3  kDa filter washes {{at the end of the}} synthesis. With the availability and relative low cost of doxorubicin, we opted to “saturate” the formulation with DOX, knowing that large amounts of the leftover DOX would likely pass through unencapsulated. Increasing the encapsulation efficiency could improve this particle platform in future work.|$|R
