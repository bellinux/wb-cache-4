40|$|Abstract-Gear teeth failure due to fatigue is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} observed. Even a slight reduction in the root tensile stress results in great increase in the fatigue life of a gear. If gear fails in tensile fatigue, the results are catastrophic and occur {{with little or no}} warnings. Therefore for all the reasons mentioned above, this work is of more practical importance. For many years, gear design has been improved by using improved material, hardening surfaces with heat treatment and carburization, and shot penning to improve surface finish etc. Few more efforts have been made to improve the durability and strength by altering the pressure angle, using the asymmetric teeth, altering the geometry of root fillet curve and so on.

30|$|It {{should be}} noticed that crater {{formation}} {{could also be}} favoured by intrinsic stresses. The sample stress as measured by MT was always compressive, as found by others [25 – 27], with values of about 1, 0.15 and 0.33 GPa for as-deposited, non-hydrogenated single layers of a-Si, a-Ge and a-Si/a-Ge MLs, respectively. For a-Si, this result is in reasonable agreement with the literature data [27, 28]. Not much is known for a-Ge. As expected, the stress for the MLs is in between those of the single layers. Nickel and Jackson [29] have speculated that the strain released {{as a consequence of}} the break of the H-host atom bonds can be re-created by its propagation through the amorphous network to the neighbouring atoms and reconstruction of strained Si-Si bonds. They concluded that the average network strain remains independent of the H concentration and annealing as well [29]. It might thus be assumed that the annealed hydrogenated samples do not change their stress significantly with respect to that measured in the as-deposited ones. Other findings suggest that annealing causes <b>stress</b> <b>relieve</b> in hydrogenated amorphous Si/Ge MLs [30]. Should there be changes in these samples, it is very likely that the intrinsic stress of a-Ge always remains smaller than the one of a-Si upon annealing owing to the great difference between the values of the as-deposited samples. The contribution of stress should thus play a minor role in differentiating the formation rate of the craters in a-Si and a-Ge. Further investigations are underway to better clarify this point.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Dimensional {{stability}} of polymer-based dental materials is compromised by polymerization {{reaction of the}} monomer. The conversion into a polymer {{is accompanied by a}} closer packing of molecules, which leads to volume reduction called curing contraction or polymerization shrinkage. Curing contraction may break the adhesion between the adhesive system and hard tooth tissues forming micrographs which may result in marginal deterioration, recurrent caries and pulp injury. Polymerization shrinkage of resin-based restorative dental materials Polymerization of the organic phase (monomer molecules) of resin-based dental materials causes shrinkage. The space occupied by filler particles is not associated with polymerization shrinkage. However, high filler loading within certain limits, can contribute to a lesser curing contraction. Polymerization shrinkage stress and stress reduction possibilities Polymerization shrinkage stress of polymer-based dental resins can be controlled in various ways. The adhesive bond in tooth-restoration interface guides the contraction forces to cavity walls. If leakage occurs, complications like secondary caries and pulpal irritation may jeopardize the longevity of a restoration. <b>Stress</b> <b>relieve</b> can be obtained by modifications of the monomer and photoinitiator, or by specially designed tooth preparation and application of bases and liners of low modulus of elasticity. The polymerization contraction can be compensated by water absorption due to oral cavity surrounding. The newest approach to stress relief is based on modulation of polymerization initiation. Conclusion This work deals with polymerization contraction and how to achieve leak-proof restoration. Restorative techniques that may reduce the negative effect of polymerization shrinkage stress need further research in order to confirm up-to-date findings...|$|E

This PWHT unavoidably results in a further tempering treatment also of the base metal whose hardness and mechanical strength are further diminished. In addition, in field PWHT are not simple to carry out; heating panels are used, consisting of electrical resistances, embedded in ceramic tiles, under a proper insulation. Notwithstanding each panel is controlled by a thermocouple, temperature may vary from zone to zone, and even under a single panel differences of +/- 5 ° C can be recorded. Furthermore, K type thermocouples that are usually used have an allowable max. error at the PWHT temperature of 0, 5 %. Last, but not least, some degree of freedom is also left for the selection of the PWHT maximum temperature and time. Under these premises, tempering of base metal not only produces a redistribution of carbides, which increase their size and are increasingly located at grain boundaries, but may also result in some increase of the ferrite grain size.

Replacement therapy is still preferred in systemic treatment. The factor replacement therapy can be divided into preventive treatment and the treatment based on specific needs of the patients. In 1994, WFH (International Federation of Hemophilia) and WHO established the early preventive treatment as the best treatment protocol for pediatric patients with severe hemophilia. Specifically speaking, the systemic therapy includes the following aspects: (1) Replacement therapy: fresh frozen plasma; cryoprecipitate; genetic engineering products of F VIII; F VIII preparations from animal; recombinant activated factor VIIα preparations; prothrombin complex concentrate; FIX preparations with high purity. (2) Medication-assisted therapy: ranitidine, desmopressin, danazol, antifibrinolytic agents and carbazochrome salicylate. (3) Spleen cell transplantation or spleen transplantation. (4) Gene therapy. Since 1970 s, the morbidity and mortality of hemophilia has been greatly reduced with the effective application of replacement treatment. Since 1980 s, the safety of replacement treatment is guaranteed with the continuous improvement of virus inactivation technology, thereby greatly reducing the incidence of viral hepatitis and AIDS in hemophilia. Since the 1990 s, the widespread application of recombinant coagulation factors not only improves the efficacy, but also avoids the side effects of antibody production and viral infection caused by the application of traditional human-derived clotting factors.

40|$|Manufacturing of {{aero engine}} {{components}} requires attention to residual stress and final {{shape of the}} product in order to meet high quality product standards. This sets very high demands on involved manufacturing steps to meet design requirements. Simulation of manufacturing processes can therefore be animportant tool to contribute to quality assurance. The focus in this work is on simulation of a manufacturing process chain comprising of sheet metal forming, welding and a stress relief heat treatment. Simulation of sheet metal forming can be used to design a forming tool design that accounts for the material behaviour, e. g. spring back, and avoid problems such as wrinkling, thinning and cracking. Moreover, the simulation can also show how the material is stretched and work hardened. The residual stresses after forming may be of local character or global depending on the shape that is formed. However, the heat affected zone due to welding is located near the weld. The weld also causes large residual stresses with the major component along the weld. It is found that the magnitude of the residual stresses after welding is affected by remaining stresses from the previous sheet metal forming. The final <b>stress</b> <b>relieve</b> treatment will relax these residual stresses caused by e. g. forming and welding. However, this causes additional deformations. The main focus of this study is on how a manufacturing process step affects the subsequent step when manufacturing a component of the nickel-based super alloy 718. The chosen route and geometry is a simplified leading edge of an exhaust case guide vane. The simulations were validated versus experiments. The computed deformations were compared with measurements after each manufacturing step. The overall agreement between experiments and measurement was good. However, not sufficiently accurate considering the required tolerance of the component. It was found from simulations that the residual stresses after each process affects the subsequent step. After a complete manufacturing process chain which ends with a stress relief heat treatment the residual stresses were not negligible. VIII Special experiments were performed for studying the stress relief in order to understand how the stresses evolve through the heat treatment cycle during relaxation. It was found that the stresses were reduced already during the beginning of the heating up sequence due to decreasing Young´s modulus and yield stress with increasing temperature.

Thoroughly inspect the welded/machined area by magnetic particle, ultrasonic, and dye check procedures after each sequence. ? <b>Stress</b> <b>relieve</b> the welded area after each sequence, using computer controlled heating of the desired area so as to control hardness in the heat affected zone (HAZ) and assure adequate metallurgical properties in the weld metal. ? Repeat these sequences until the repaired area conforms to the design required by welding engineering, mechanical engineering, insurance specialists, and/or consulting metallurgical laboratories. These procedures can often provide metallurgical properties superior to those of the original material, move the heat affected zone (HAZ) out of the steam path, strengthen the repaired area, compensate for anticipated problems, and/or improve the original design of the rotor. Such repairs involve use of special jigs, equipment, techniques, and procedures. A detailed description of the turbine rim weld repair is given, including use of supplementary pictures, drawings and techniques. Cracks were discovered in the body of a nominal 22 in diameter, first stage Curtis wheel of a forged turbine rotor. Laboratory analysis indicated the cracks were due to stress corrosion, believed to have been caused by caustic introduced accidentally with inlet steam. The damaged portion of the wheel was removed by machining at a point well into the unaffected portion of the wheel. The remaining rim was welded to build up, heat treated, finish machined to accept blades, and rebladed. The finished rotor was dynamically balanced at operating speed, installed in its casing, and returned to service. The reinstalled rotor has operated without trouble at up to design conditions for a number of months. These welding procedures were evolved and improved through experience gained over the past eight years in the repair of about 80 damaged turbine rims. Similar repairs have also been performed on centrifugal compressor rotor wheels and shafting. Monitoring and periodic shop inspection of these welded rotors has shown no degradation in the repaired areas. Repair costs have been well below those that would have been incurred by replacement with original vendor equipment and, most often, in significantly less time than it would have taken if a new rotor was provided from the original equipment manufacturer...|$|E

In PM steels such properties are achieved, for example by modifying the composition (alloying elements), utilizing different alloying techniques (prealloying, diffusion bonding and admixing) and application of heat treatments (e. g. hardening/sinterhardening, carburising, tempering, etc.). It has recently been found that under certain conditions, PM steel components lack dimensional stability in applications under high static loads over a sustained period of time at temperatures where creep normally doesn’t occur. In high performance applications, such a small dimensional instability could have an adverse effect on the overall performance of the system. Preliminary tests indicate that the components tend to creep/relax at low temperatures under high loading conditions. This phenomenon is a recent observation in PM steels, whereas, in bearing steels and other metallic materials (i. e. Cu, Ti) such behaviour has been discussed earlier. Hence, the creep/relaxation phenomena at temperatures (T/Tm< 0. 3, temperature in kelvin) in PM steels under high static loading conditions is investigated for diffusion-alloyed powder grade (Distaloy HP produced by Höganäs AB) material. The experiments were performed on the sinterhardened tensile specimens that were additionally heat treated as follows: (i) without any tempering (untempered); (ii) after subsequent tempering at 200 °C and 300 °C (tempered); (iii) specimens with subsequent quenching in liquid nitrogen directly after sinterhardening (untempered-deep cooled); (iv) sinterhardened and quenched in liquid nitrogen specimens with subsequent tempering at 200 °C and 300 °C (deepcooled-tempered). The test specimens are characterised and the properties are analysed and evaluated before and after creep tests by XRD, optical and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that each specimen exhibits a unique characteristic behaviour associated with the test temperature and corresponding tempering conditions. However, untempered specimens exhibited a noticeable amount of plastic strain at 120 °C when compared to the tempered (at 200 °C) specimens. For the specimens tempered at a higher temperature (at 300 °C) there is a negligible amount of plastic strain when testing under similar conditions. Also, the deepcooled-tempered specimens exhibited smaller amount of strain when compared to the only tempered samples. This behaviour of the specimens is attributed to the microstructural stability and <b>stress</b> <b>relieve</b> while tempering at high temperatures reduces the dimensional instability of the above studied PM steel under high static loads over a prolonged time period. A more detailed study for understanding this phenomenon in PM steels is required to further widen their application in automotive industry...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} an investigation which was undertaken to reveal the similarities and differences in the mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics of three Ni-Hard I alloys. One alloy (B 1) is ASTM A 532 class IA Ni-Hard containing 4. 2 wt. pct. Ni. The second alloy (B 2) is similar to B 1 but higher in Cr, Si, and Mo. The third alloy (T 1) also falls in the same ASTM specification, but it contains 3. 3 wt. pct. Ni. The alloys were evaluated in both as-cast and stress-relieved conditions except for B 2, which was evaluated in the stress-relieved condition only. While the matrix of the high Ni alloys is composed of austenite and martensite in both conditions, the matrix of the low Ni alloy consists of a considerable amount of bainite, in addition to the martensite and the retained austenite in as cast condition, and primarily bainite, with some retained austenite, in the <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> condition. It was found that the <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> treatment does not change the tensile strength of the high Ni alloy. Both the as cast and <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> high Ni alloys had a tensile strength of about 350 MPa. On the other hand, the tensile strength of the low Ni alloy increased from 340 MPa to 452 MPa with the <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> treatment. There {{was no significant difference in}} the wear resistance of these alloys in both as-cast and stressrelieved conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{superalloy}} of Inconel 718 {{variety is}} widely used to produce compressor blade in gas turbine engine. The blade tip invariably wears in services and thus requires frequent metallization for repairing. In most commercial Turbine Engine Industries the metallised blades, after grinding, undergo a <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> heat treatment at 760 0 C before return for applications. In this study, the metallised blade is heat treated at different conditions and compared its microstructure and hardness {{with those of the}} standard <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> treatment blades used in most industries. The microstructure of the <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> sample contains dendrite with hardness of 230 HV for the melt zone, 190 HV for the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) and 420 HV for the parent metal. Solutionising at 982 or 1066 0 C developed hardness less than 220 HV in all sections. By long time ageing treatment of the solutionised sample developed high hardness across the whole blade. These treatments homogenized the microstructure and produced high hardness values by precipitation of secondary phase structures across the blade...|$|R
