25|$|Starting in 1975, 35 {{aircraft}} were {{upgraded to}} MR2 standard, being re-delivered from August 1979. The upgrade included extensive modernisation of the aircraft's electronic suite. Changes included {{the replacement of}} the obsolete ASV Mk 21 radar used by the Shackleton and Nimrod MR1 with the new EMI <b>Searchwater</b> <b>radar,</b> a new acoustic processor (GEC-Marconi AQS-901) capable of handling more modern sonobouys, a new mission data recorder (Hanbush) and a new Electronic Support Measures (Yellow Gate) which included new pods on the wingtips.|$|E

5000|$|Skymaster: Development of Searchwater AEW/LAST, {{combining}} the air-to-surface {{capability of the}} original Searchwater and the air-to-air capability of Searchwater AEW/LAST. Developed as the radar for Argus-2000 AEW&C system to be installed on British Aerospace Nimrod AEW3. which was eventually cancelled. However, 6 complete Argus-2000 AEW&C systems plus two more Skymaster radar as spares were purchased by China in 1997 for 66 million US dollars. The experienced gained from Skymaster/Argus-2000 program despite its eventual cancellation {{has been used in}} the modernization of other models of <b>Searchwater</b> <b>radars.</b>|$|R
25|$|The phased {{withdrawal}} of the Gannet AEW, {{as part of the}} draw-down of fixed wing aviation in the Fleet Air Arm, led to a need for the Royal Air Force to take over the provision of Airborne Early Warning for the UK Air Defence Region. As an interim solution until a purpose built system could be procured, the radar and electronic systems from redundant Gannets were fitted to similarly redundant Avro Shackletons; the Shackleton was a maritime patrol aircraft then {{in the process of being}} replaced. However, this still meant that the Royal Navy, then in the process of introducing a new type of small aircraft carrier incapable of operating conventional fixed-wing aircraft, lacked an embedded AEW platform that could be used as part of the carrier task group. This lack of organic AEW capability following the {{withdrawal of}} the Gannet was seen as misguided, particularly following the experience of the Falklands War, in which the Royal Navy lost four ships due to the Task Force being reliant on shipborne air search. As a consequence, the Westland Sea King helicopter was modified to incorporate the <b>Searchwater</b> <b>radar</b> system for use in the AEW role from the Invincible class.|$|E

5|$|According to BAE Systems, the Nimrod MRA4 systems was {{to enable}} the crews to gather, process and display up to 20 times more {{technical}} and strategic data than the MR2. The <b>Searchwater</b> 2000 <b>radar</b> was stated to have been capable over land as well as water; {{with the ability to}} have swept {{an area the size of}} the UK every 10 seconds. The Aircraft Synthetic Training Aids (ASTA) provided by Thales Training & Simulation was an electronic training suite to allow the training of crew members to transfer from active MRA4 aircraft to ground-based training systems; this change was made to increase the availability of the aircraft for operational missions and allow for more intensive training exercises.|$|R
5000|$|The upgrade {{programme}} {{resulted in}} the Sea King AEW fleet being upgraded with a new mission system, Comms, NavAids, JTIDS, Active Noise Reduction and Videographic recording. The Mission System Upgrade (MSU) component (Radar and partial JTIDS integration) was based around the improved <b>Searchwater</b> 2000AEW <b>radar,</b> with an all-new man Machine Interface. This MSU component was later termed [...] "Project Cerberus" [...] by Thales, after successful integration was conducted by Westland and GEC-Marconi. This variant was initially {{referred to as the}} Sea King AEW7, but renamed ASaC7 just before In Service Date. (Airborne Surveillance and Control Mk.7). The main role of the Sea King ASaC7 is detection of low-flying attack aircraft; it also provides interception/attack control and over-the-horizon targeting for surface-launched weapon systems. In comparison to older versions, the new radar enables the ASaC7 to simultaneously track up to 400 targets, instead of an earlier limit of 250 targets. The effectiveness of the AEW7 was greatly increased via the addition of a Link 16 data link, allowing gathered radar information to be analysed and rapidly put to use by multiple allied platforms in range.|$|R
5000|$|The future AEW {{capability}} of the FAA is the [...] "Crowsnest" [...] programme, which intended to replace the current Sea King ASaC7 fleet due to retire in 2016. Current plans will see Crowsnest enter service in 2022 (with a main gate in 2017) acting as a roll-on/roll-off fit for the FAAs Merlin HM2 helicopters. The original six year capability-gap between the retirement of the Sea King ASaC7 fleet and the entry service of Crowsnest {{was the source of}} much criticism. A recent PAC report, however, has revealed the Main Gate decision for the Crowsnest to be around 2017. Crowsnest will be operational by 2019. As a result of the time gap between the planned out of service date of the Sea King in 2016, and the introduction of [...] "Crowsnest" [...] seven Sea King ASaC.7 helicopters will remain in service with the RN through to the second half of 2018. Thales was selected as the chosen bidder to provide the radar and mission system {{at the heart of the}} Crowsnest capability on 22 May 2015. They will provide a slightly upgraded version of the existing <b>Searchwater</b> 2000 <b>radar.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Searchwater</b> <b>radar</b> was {{developed}} by the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment and EMI (later Thorn Sensors Group). Racal Radar Defence Systems acquired Searchwater in 1995. Thorn and Racal merged to form Racal-Thorn Defence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Searchwater</b> <b>radar</b> is a {{maritime}} surveillance radar developed by Thorn EMI under project P1149. This type of radar {{has been in}} service with the Royal Air Force Hawker Siddeley Nimrod aboard the MR2 variant since the 1970s.|$|E

Normally flown with three person (pilot and two observers) crew compared with four-person crew for ASW Sea Kings. Nine converted.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Navy's {{airborne}} {{early warning}} (AEW) capability had been lost when the Fairey Gannet aeroplane was withdrawn after {{the last of the}} RN's fleet carriers was decommissioned in 1978. During the Falklands War, a number of warships were lost and casualties suffered {{due to the lack of}} an AEW platform. The proposed fleet cover by the RAF Shackleton AEW.2 was too unresponsive and at too great a distance to be practical. Consequently, two Sea King HAS2s were modified in 1982 with the addition of the Thorn-EMI ARI 5980/3 <b>Searchwater</b> LAST <b>radar</b> attached to the fuselage on a swivel arm and protected by an inflatable dome. This allowed the radar to be lowered below the fuselage during flight and for it to be raised for landing. These prototypes, designated HAS2(AEW), were both flying within 11 weeks and deployed with 824 [...] "D" [...] Flight on HMS Illustrious, serving in the Falklands after the cessation of hostilities. A further eight HAS2s were modified to a production standard, known as the AEW2. Two remained [...] "fitted for but not with". [...] These entered operational service in 1985, being deployed by 849 Naval Air Squadron. Three Sea King HAS5/6s were later converted as part of the ASaC Mk7 programme, bringing the Mk7 fleet to 13; still 3 below the requirement.|$|R
5000|$|The {{importance}} of Airborne Early Warning (AEW) was shown. The Royal Navy had effectively no over-the-horizon radar capability. This was hastily rectified after the war, with Sea King helicopters fitted with radomes containing {{a variant of}} the Nimrod ASW aircraft's <b>Searchwater</b> <b>radar.</b> These first travelled south after the war on the brand new , sister ship to [...]|$|E

50|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the Nimrod AEW programme, BAe Woodford began looking at ways that the now redundant airframes could be re-used, and entered into studies looking at the potential use of the Nimrod as a missile carrying strike aircraft. BAe's intention {{would have seen the}} AEW modifications, primarily the FASS scanners, and the fuel and cooling systems installed in the weapons bay, removed. The <b>Searchwater</b> <b>radar,</b> at the time fitted to the Nimrod MR.2, would have been installed in a nose installation, and the weapons bay outfitted to accommodate up to six Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles. However, this did not go beyond the study phase, and the airframes were eventually scrapped during the 1990s.|$|E

Despite the limitations of the Sea King, in terms of its operating altitude and endurance, it remained the only feasible option from its introduction, in spite of efforts to design a platform more suitable - one such attempt came when BAe undertook a private study into the use of the proposed P.1216 advanced STOVL aircraft as an AEW platform, with a straight form wing and podded radar system. However, this proposal would have had a span of more than 60 ft, which was deemed the upper limit for operation aboard , and thus would have been difficult to accommodate on a ship the size of [...]|$|E
