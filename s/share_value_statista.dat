50|$|The {{researchers}} found <b>Shared</b> <b>value</b> has not greatly progressed, with subsequent literature {{focused on the}} types of models and activities that businesses are undertaking to create <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> (create <b>shared</b> <b>value).</b> They claim a slight development was Porter and Kramer’s 2011 attempt to broaden the concept of <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> beyond the arena of corporate social responsibility with a greater focus {{on the nature of}} capitalism and markets, noting dislocations with current capitalism, emphasising the inherent social nature of markets, and suggesting that by adopting <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> principles business and society will be reconnected creating new innovation and socially imbued capitalism.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{field of}} CSR has {{developed}} from charity into an integration of <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> {{into the business}} model. In developing countries there are enormous needs for better housing. This therefore could be an area where companies {{might be able to}} create <b>shared</b> <b>value.</b> It is however unclear how <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> would look like in the building supply network and to what extent this already exists. Purpose: The purpose is to detect future areas of research by identifying opportunities for <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> in the building material supply chain. <b>Shared</b> <b>value</b> is viewed as a possible example of synergy for quality and sustainability research and development. Methodology: A literature review is carried out searching for “shared value” and “Porter”. The findings are combined with stakeholder theory, the process view and customer focus. Additionally the sustainability reports of the 15 largest cement and building material companies in the world were studied with the purpose of identifying examples of the <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> concept. Working with <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> is visualised with an example using the process of building material supply in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Findings: Findings indicate that the concept of <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> is widely spread, but that its application in the cement and building material supply industry still is limited. The concept seems to have a good potential in identifying and creating value for both business and other stakeholders. <b>Shared</b> <b>value</b> can be seen as enlarged business focus from shareholders to stakeholders. Practical implications: The results provide both ideas for further research and indicate how companies within the building material network could work with <b>shared</b> <b>value.</b> Originality/value: The paper more clearly links <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> to stakeholder focus...|$|R

50|$|The {{researchers}} found {{little evidence of}} an overall business perspective on the <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> framework, not surprising given the relatively newness of the concept as firms may have been pursuing <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> practices without it being realised as such, especially outside of the US {{and it was not}} clear how to measure if a business is pursuing <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> as opposed to overlapping areas of CSR or philanthropic activities.

30|$|Creating <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> is the {{opportunity}} driven approach of business entities to benefit the less addressed segment of the society through their core products and services. For bank financial institutions, {{the opportunity}} driven approach signifies that banking corporations ought to identify bankable needs that are less addressed or unaddressed and invest on purpose to benefit both society and business. The study strives to develop a conceptual model of how Private Commercial Banks (PCBs) in Bangladesh are creating <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> (a popular concept developed by ([Porter ME, Kramer MR], [The big idea: creating shared value; how to reinvent capitalism—and unleash a wave of innovation and growth], [2011])) through reviewing the products and services of PCBs in light of available literature {{in the field of}} strategic corporate social responsibility and creating <b>shared</b> <b>value.</b> The model has identified core products and services that are creating <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> for both the bank and the society concurrently. It has also identified factors that are limiting <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation capacity of PCBs. Thus, the model will assist the money market policy planners especially bankers to identify the products, services, markets, and value chain that could augment capacity of creating <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> and remove the road-blocks for creating upscale <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> in the developing country context.|$|R

30|$|Unlike CSR, which assume {{businesses}} to consider social responsibility as supplementary, the <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> approach assumes that social responsibility {{is the center}} of every business performance. <b>Shared</b> <b>value</b> is not about personal values, nor about “sharing” the value already created by firms as is assumed by CSR. Instead, <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> is about expanding the total pool of economic and social value (Porter and Kramer, 2011). That means <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> is created when business undertake various unmet or less addressed social needs and challenges as business opportunity. Hence, earning fair profit from social purpose is justified. This concept takes into account philanthropy only when it creates social as well as business value.|$|R
30|$|The overall {{findings}} of the study suggest that the PCBs are creating <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> mostly through reconceiving their products and services and redefining their value chain to boost productivity.

40|$|AbstractEcosystem {{services}} conceptualise {{the diverse}} values that ecosystems provide to humanity. This was {{recognised in the}} United Kingdom's National Ecosystem Assessment, which noted that appreciation of the full value of ecosystem services requires recognition of <b>values</b> that are <b>shared.</b> By operationalising the <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> concept, {{it is argued that}} the contribution of ecosystem services to human well-being can be represented more holistically. This paper considers current understanding of <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> and develops a new metanarrative of <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> beyond the aggregated utilities of individuals. This metanarrative seeks to conceptualise how values can be held both individually and communally, and what this means for identifying their scale and means of enumeration. The paper poses a new reading of the idea of <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> that reconciles the elicitation of pre-formed individual values with the formation and expression of <b>shared</b> social <b>values.</b> The implication is that <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> need to be conceived as normative constructs that are derived through social processes of value formation and expression. <b>Shared</b> <b>values</b> thus do not necessarily exist a priori; they can be deliberated through formal and informal processes through which individuals can separate their own preferences from a broader metanarrative about what values ought to be shared...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue in}} this thesis {{that the concept of}} <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> {{creation}} introduced by Porter and Kramer (2011) contain weaknesses when it comes to providing guidance for how industries can achieve <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation. An analytical framework which adapts the concept into an industry context is therefore developed {{in this thesis}}, where four aspects, namely innovation, long-term orientation, cooperation and stakeholder trust, are found to be crucial. Furthermore, the authorities are argued to have a particularly important role in facilitating <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation in industries through the implementation of regulatory frameworks. The analytical framework is furthermore applied to the Norwegian aquaculture industry in order to investigate how the industry can become more corporate sustainable. The Norwegian aquaculture industry is currently experiencing severe sustainability challenges that need to be overcome if the industry is to realize growth, in which <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation emerges as an important measure. Two research questions associated with how <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation can be realized in the Norwegian aquaculture industry are answered in the thesis. The first research question identifies the current barriers to <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation in the industry, while the second research question determines how governmental policies can help the industry to overcome these barriers. The research questions are answered through a qualitative case study of the development licenses, in which 12 semi-structured interviews with different industry stakeholders are conducted. Several barriers are found to prevent the Norwegian aquaculture industry from creating <b>shared</b> <b>value,</b> and the development licenses are further found to overcome some of these barriers. However, a substantial amount of barriers are still seen to be present after the implementation of the development license policy. The policy is thus found to come short in facilitating <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation in the industry, and propositions for how governmental policies can better facilitate <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation in the industry are provided. We furthermore argue that governmental regulations alone do not have the potential of overcoming all of the barriers to <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation, and aquaculture companies must take several measures for the industry to achieve <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation. Another important aspect to consider is whether the framework would be applicable in other industry contexts. When addressing this concern, the validity of the analytical framework was found to be strengthened as the presumptions of the framework was consistent with the empirical data from the analysis...|$|R

50|$|Unger concludes {{his account}} of liberal {{political}} thought by exploring the idea of <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> as a possible {{solution to the problem}} of order and freedom that liberalism failed to solve. Unger sees the concept of <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> as a possible basis for saving formalism, a formalism based on plain meanings that derive from shared social life, not derived from the unsupportable doctrine of intelligible essences. <b>Shared</b> <b>values</b> could also serve as a basis for a regime of substantive justice, in which decisions would be made based on their ability to promote common ends. Rules could have plain meanings because that are backed by a common vision of the world. Unger sees the possibility of <b>shared</b> <b>values,</b> conceived in this way, as requiring group values that are neither individual nor subjective. A system of ideas and social life in which <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> would have this central role would be one in which the distinction between fact and value has been repudiated. But under liberalism, and the social experience that exists in the grip of liberal doctrine, <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> could not have this force. Unger believes <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> have this promise, but that this promise could only be realized under two conditions: the development of a new system of thought, and the occurrence of a political event that transforms the conditions of social life. The theory of organic groups, which he will explore at the end of Knowledge and Politics, describes a setting in which these conditions are satisfied.|$|R
