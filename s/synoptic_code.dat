The reports are coded using the <b>synoptic</b> <b>code,</b> and relayed via radio or satellite to weather organizations worldwide. Buoy reports are automated, and maintained by the country that moored the buoy in that location. Larger moored buoys are used near shore, while smaller drifting buoys are used farther out at sea.|$|E
40|$|Surface weather {{observations}} of clouds were analyzed {{to obtain a}} global cloud climatology (Warren et al, 1986; 1988). The form of the synoptic weather code limits the types of cloud information which are available from these reports. Comparison of surface weather reports with instrumental observations during the FIRE field experiments can help to clarify the operational definitions which {{were made in the}} climatology {{because of the nature of}} the <b>synoptic</b> <b>code.</b> The long-term climatology from surface weather observations is also useful background for planning the location and timing of intensive field experiments...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPublished climatologies of marine-fog frequencies are in disagreement for common areas, although {{the nature and}} magnitude of errors are difficult to assess since actual frequencies for specific locations may be derived only from observations at Ocean Stations. The usual methods of computing fog frequencies, on a seasonal or monthly basis, are percent-of-reports-with-fog and number-of-fog-days. This study presents a method of synthesizing the elements of surface-ship synoptic reports into a computerized scheme {{for the purpose of}} deriving frequencies of marine fog occurrence. The program, based on a liberal interpretation of reporting guidelines in the <b>Synoptic</b> <b>Code</b> Manual, utilizes 16 combinations of present and past weather, and visibility, to identify fog in the reports. The program then objectively assigns the duration of fog for the three- or six-hour period represented by the synoptic report. A prototype climatology of marine-fog occurrence for July, over the eastern North Pacific Ocean, is derived from application of the method to a ten-year data base (1963 - 72). Results are compared to published and other defined marine-fog climatologies. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
50|$|One {{common use}} of utility {{stations}} is disseminating weather information. Weather information is often broadcast using RTTY and sending <b>synoptic</b> <b>codes,</b> or weather charts are sent using radiofax, {{which are used}} by mariners and others. Airports make voice weather broadcasts on HF, known as VOLMET. Some examples include New York Radio, which broadcasts weather information for locations in the eastern United States, or Shanwick Radio, which does the same for Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Species: Altocumulus {{has four}} species. The {{stratiformis}} species (Ac str) {{is composed of}} sheets or relatively flat patches of stratocumuliform cloud. The <b>synoptic</b> <b>coding</b> {{is determined by the}} predominant variety or occasionally by the genitus mother cloud. Altocumulus lenticularis (Ac len lenticular cloud) is a lens-shaped middle cloud which can resemble flying saucers and may occasionally be mistaken for [...] "unidentified flying objects". This is formed by uplift usually associated with mountains. but usually with at least some grey shading. It is coded CM4 on the SYNOP weather observation. Grey shading is also seen with altocumulus castellanus (Ac cas), a turreted middle cloud that can achieve significant vertical development and signals increasing airmass instability. It is nevertheless usually classified as middle rather than vertical and is coded CM8. The floccus species (Ac flo) is a tufted middle cloud which is also associated with greater instability. It shares the same code CM8. Chaotic altocumulus, which is typically poorly defined with multiple species or transitional forms arranged in several layers, is coded CM9.|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{frequency of}} atmospheric dust observations was investigated {{for the southern}} part of Iceland and interpreted together with earlier results obtained from northeastern (NE) Iceland (Dagsson-Waldhauserova et al., 2013). In total, over 34 dust days per year on average occurred in Iceland based on conventionally used <b>synoptic</b> <b>codes</b> for dust observations. However, frequent volcanic eruptions, with the re-suspension of volcanic materials and dust haze, increased the number of dust events fourfold (135 dust days annually). The position of the Icelandic Low determined whether dust events occurred in the NE (16. 4 dust days annually) or in the southern (S) part of Iceland (about 18 dust days annually). The decade with the most frequent dust days in S Iceland was the 1960 s, but the 2000 s in NE Iceland. A total of 32 severe dust storms (visibility < 500 m) were observed in Iceland with the highest frequency of events during the 2000 s in S Iceland. The Arctic dust events (NE Iceland) were typically warm, occurring during summer/autumn (May–September) and during mild southwesterly winds, while the subarctic dust events (S Iceland) were mainly cold, occurring during winter/spring (March–May) and during strong northeasterly winds. About half of the dust events in S Iceland occurred in winter or at sub-zero temperatures. A good correlation was found between particulate matter (PM 10) concentrations and visibility during dust observations at the stations Vík and Stórhöfði. This study shows that Iceland is among the dustiest areas of the world and that dust is emitted year-round...|$|R
40|$|Until 1982, {{when the}} National Research Institute for Oceanology (NRIO) erected self-contained, {{automatic}} weather stations (AWS) on the Cape South Coast, no continuous coastal measurements were available. This Institute had erected an AWS on {{the drilling rig}} Sedco K in 1978, so that over 3 years of very valuable off- shore data was already available on the adjacent Agulhas Bank. Al though the weather offices at George and Port Elizabeth have made accurate meteorological observations for over 30 years, this data is shown here to differ significantly from actual coastal measurements. Thus the NRIO AWS network, which operated for just over a year, provided a detailed, short-term data set {{for the study of}} coastal weather processes. In order to acquire longer term data from coastal observations, five years of hourly wind observations from lighthouse keepers along the Cape South Coast were also utilised. Although these are estimates, it is shown that a coastal estimate may be more representative of marine conditions than an anemometer reading some distance inland. Voluntary Observing Ship's data (VOS) extracted from SADCO's Marine Climatology database, provided the long-term offshore information, whilst also supplying very useful 'present weather' (<b>synoptic</b> <b>code</b> ww) observations for case studies. Observations from synoptic stations for the period that the coastal AWS were deployed (February 1982 - March 1983), were provided by the South African Weather Bureau. With this unique and comprehensive data set, the various weather systems affecting the region are discussed. Twelve case studies form the main reference for this discussion, which includes relevant oceanographic parameters. The weather systems are considered firstly as individually propagating circulations with the AWS network providing details of propagation speeds and coastwise development. Secondly the combined 'weather producing' effects of these systems are discussed, with a strong emphasis being placed on man/weather interactions. It is shown that certain operations along the Cape South Coast and over the Agulhas Bank, are extremely weather sensitive, and would benefit considerably from an increased knowledge of weather processes. Recommendations aimed not only at those managing weather sensitive operations, but also at those involved in coastal meteorological measurement and research, complete the thesis...|$|E
40|$|M. A. This work {{is aimed}} at dealing with the demand for the new ethos as proclaimed by the New Testament {{synoptic}} {{in view of the}} African context or perspective. The <b>synoptic</b> give a <b>code</b> of values by which the Christian church should live. The synoptic ethos is Jesus' ethos. Every nation and community is characterised by certain values of conduct. As a church we are also confronted by moments of decision making. This script is therefore attempting to answer or question the level of credibility taken at some point in life. Ethics which is a science of moral behaviour and principles of conduct, tells us that there is an expected way of behaviour from every individual in society. The question is when, when do we say that this is right, and when do we say this is wrong ? However, this script is not aimed at necessarily dealing with ethics in general. I have narrowed my subject to focus on the Kingdom ethos reflected in the synoptic. The only issue that one need to take into consideration is that all ethics have sources. The problem that existed in proclaiming Kingdom ethics has been religion. This script shows that religion and ethics are so interwoven that one cannot separate them. It is impossible for one to speak about one's moral behaviour and not include his religion. Religion tells people what to say and what not, what to eat and what not, where to go and what people to associate with and not. Religion and ethics are integrated in such w way that one cannot do without the other. One cannot speak about ethics outside religion. The ethos of the Jews came from their monotheistic religion, with the Law of Moses. Jesus' ethics came from His focus on the Kingdom which was both present and future. This shows again the problem of religion in Africa. African ethics have been drawn mostly from their own cultures, customs and religion. Jesus' Kingdom ethics, which is God centred, helps to show that all other sources are not relevant sources. Many church leaders in Africa are calling for an African religion and criticising the missionaries for having brought Western religion. The Kingdom ethics show how that it is not Western or African religion that matters much, all we need is the Christian religion and Jesus' ethos of the Kingdom. Finally the church is expected to play its role of reconciling this divided world. The purpose of the church is man, his human dignity and his right to develop himself in freedom. Jesus commanded the church to love, hence it is the duty of the church to be the prophetic voice of God in this confused generation. The ethics demanded by Jesus are practical and possible. We need God's mercy and grace to be real ambassadors of the Kingdom of God. As a church we have a responsibility. We need to move away from syncretism and serve God alone...|$|R
