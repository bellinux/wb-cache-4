5|$|Favoured {{soils are}} deep grey sandy loams or {{shallower}} sand overlying claypan. Associated vegetation is typically <b>scrubland</b> or shrubland, although moisture-loving trees such as B.littoralis (Swamp Banksia) or Melaleuca preissiana (Moonah) {{may also be}} present, sometimes in sufficient numbers to form a low open woodland.|$|E
5|$|Before 1977, no {{expedition}} {{had been}} to Stewart Island/Rakiura {{to search for the}} bird. In 1977, sightings of kakapo were reported on Stewart Island. An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kakapo. The finding in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified <b>scrubland</b> and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds.|$|E
5|$|The area {{comprises}} semi-arid stony ridges, claypans and a stony plateau, {{and experiences}} a sub-tropical climate, {{with a wet}} season between January and March. The vegetation is mostly <b>scrubland,</b> including spinifex grasslands. The fauna is generally typical of Australian desert environments, and includes the red kangaroo, the eastern wallaroo, the northern nail-tail wallaby, and the spinifex hopping mouse.|$|E
50|$|Interior <b>scrublands</b> occur {{naturally}} in semi-arid areas where soils are nutrient-poor, such {{as on the}} matas of Portugal which are underlain by Cambrian and Silurian schists. Florida scrub {{is another example of}} interior <b>scrublands.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Scrublands</b> {{occur in}} the driest areas, {{especially}} areas near the seacoast where wind and salt spray are frequent. Low, soft-leaved <b>scrublands</b> around the Mediterranean are known as garrigar in Catalan, garrigue in French, phrygana in Greek, tomillares in Spanish, and batha in Hebrew.|$|R
50|$|Sphincterochila cariosula {{occurs in}} <b>scrublands</b> and in semideserts.|$|R
5|$|The {{region is}} semi-arid, and the {{vegetation}} is generally <b>scrubland.</b> Muckaty Station {{lies at the}} boundary of two bioregions, Tanami and Sturt Plateau. The Tanami bioregion is made up primarily of sandplains vegetated with bootlace oak (Hakea lorea), desert bloodwoods (Corymbia species), acacias and grevilleas, together with spinifex grasslands. The Sturt Plateau bioregion also includes spinifex grasslands, but with a canopy of bloodwood trees.|$|E
5|$|The shrub grows amongst <b>scrubland</b> in {{seasonally}} wet lowland {{areas of}} the coastal sandplain between Badgingarra and Serpentine in Western Australia. A little studied species, not much is known of its ecology or conservation biology. Reports do suggest, however, that it is pollinated {{by a variety of}} birds and small mammals. Like many members of series Abietinae, it has not been considered to have much horticultural potential and is rarely cultivated.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found at low {{elevations}} in semi-arid to humid areas in habitats ranging from <b>scrubland</b> and abandoned farmland to wood edge. It prefers areas with dense thickets, scrub or understory, and is uncommon in taller forest where the vegetation beneath the canopy is more open. Although {{it is largely}} sedentary, {{there may be some}} localized seasonal movements away from the drier northern parts of the Yucatán Peninsula in late summer to early winter.|$|E

50|$|Mediterranean <b>scrublands</b> occur {{naturally}} in the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biomes, {{located in the}} five Mediterranean climate regions of the world. <b>Scrublands</b> are most common near the seacoast, and have often adapted to the wind and salt air of the ocean. Low, soft-leaved <b>scrublands</b> around the Mediterranean Basin are known as garrigue in France, phrygana in Greece, tomillares in Spain, and batha in Israel. Northern coastal scrub and coastal sage scrub occur along the California coast, strandveld in the Western Cape of South Africa, coastal matorral in central Chile, and sand-heath and kwongan in Southwest Australia.|$|R
5|$|Walton and Ivythorn Hills {{are covered}} {{by a variety of}} {{semi-natural}} habitats. These include unimproved calcareous grassland, <b>scrubland</b> and coppiced woodland including field maple and Ash. The range of habitats are home to many species of invertebrate. Butterflies, Leafhoppers, Spiders and Soldier Flies are particularly well represented. There is also a population of Great Green Bush Cricket (Tettigonia viridissima).|$|E
5|$|It {{occurs in}} a wide variety of habitats, {{including}} riparian woodlands such as river red gum, bimble box and black box with an understory of lignum or saltbush; mallee woodland, especially where mixed with thickets of Broombush or Emu Bush; woodlands of Native Pine growing on sand ridges; and semi-arid <b>scrubland</b> dominated by Acacia including lancewood. On the coast The striped honeyeater is found in swamp forests of paperbark and Casuarina, and in developed areas containing native and exotic trees and shrubs such as caravan parks, reserves, gardens, and farms and orchards.|$|E
5|$|The Gila monster {{is found}} in the Southwestern United States and Mexico, a range {{including}} Sonora, Arizona, parts of California, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico (potentially including Baja California). They inhabit <b>scrubland,</b> succulent desert, and oak woodland, seeking shelter in burrows, thickets, and under rocks in locations with ready access to moisture. In fact, Gila monsters seem to like water and can be observed immersing themselves in puddles of water after a summer rain. They avoid living in open areas such as flats and farmland.|$|E

5|$|The red-capped robin prefers more arid habitat {{than its}} relatives, and inhabits dryer areas while the scarlet robin {{occupies}} wetter forests where they co-occur. The red-capped robin's preferred habitat is dry Acacia, Callitris or mixed <b>scrubland</b> or woodland, dominated by such species as mulga (Acacia aneura), Georgina gidgee (Acacia georginae), raspberry jam (Acacia acuminata), black cypress-pine (Callitris endlicheri), white cypress-pine (C. columellaris), and slender cypress-pine (C. preissii) with understory shrubs such as Cassia, hop-bush (Dodonaea), emu bush (Eremophila) and spinifex (Triodia).|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow breeds in sparsely vegetated <b>scrubland.</b> Males {{attract a}} mate by singing from regular {{positions}} {{at the edge of}} their territories throughout the breeding season. These birds are monogamous, taking only one mate at a time, and pairs often remain together for several years. If singing males come within contact of each other, they may initially raise their crowns and face the ground to display this feature; if that fails to make the other bird leave, they stiffen their body, droop their wings, raise their tails, and stick their head straight out. Males guard their territories year-round.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes {{was first}} {{described}} in 1840 by English botanist John Lindley, probably from material collected by James Drummond the previous year. There are no recognised varieties, {{although it has}} been known to hybridise with Banksia hookeriana. Widely distributed in south-west Western Australia, B.prionotes is found from Shark Bay (25° S) in the north, south as far as Kojonup (33°50′S). It grows exclusively in sandy soils, and is usually the dominant plant in <b>scrubland</b> or low woodland. Pollinated by birds, it provides food for a wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter months. It is an important source of food for honeyeaters (Meliphagidae), and is critical to their survival in the Avon Wheatbelt region, where it is the only nectar-producing plant in flower at some times of the year.|$|E
50|$|Chenopod <b>scrublands</b> (consisting {{largely of}} saltbush), sandhill cane-grass and flood debris in dry, sandy {{watercourses}}. They favour the <b>scrublands</b> with dense chenopod bushes. These denser shrublands usually occur in lower lying areas, such as watercourses and drainage lines. Both subspecies, occurring at different distributions prefer particular species. The Eastern Thick-billed Grasswren prefers saltbush. The Western Thick-billed Grasswren; black-bush and Australian boxthorn.|$|R

5|$|First {{described}} by the botanist Robert Brown in the early 19th century, no separate varieties of Banksia menziesii are recognised. It is found in Western Australia, from the Perth (32° S) region north to the Murchison River (27° S), and generally grows on sandy soils, in <b>scrubland</b> or low woodland. Banksia menziesii provides food for {{a wide array of}} invertebrate and vertebrate animals; birds and in particular honeyeaters are prominent visitors. A relatively hardy plant, Banksia menziesii is commonly seen in gardens, nature strips and parks in Australian urban areas with Mediterranean climates, but its sensitivity to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi makes it short-lived in places with humid summers, such as Sydney. Banksia menziesii is widely used in the cut flower industry both in Australia and overseas.|$|E
5|$|Its {{population}} in Canada is limited due to both snow depth {{and the presence}} of the Canadian lynx. The bobcat does not tolerate deep snow, and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas; it lacks the large, padded feet of the Canadian lynx and cannot support its weight on snow as efficiently. The bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement of the Canadian lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in Nova Scotia, while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the Canadian lynx's range to the advantage of the bobcat. In northern and central Mexico, the cat is found in dry <b>scrubland</b> and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the surface}} of the Mono Craters is barren but its slopes are covered by Jeffrey pine forest and partial greenery. Pumice Valley, {{directly}} to the west, is covered by sagebrush <b>scrubland.</b> The soil consists primarily of deep pumice, which does not hold water well. Mycorrhizal fungi in the soil invade the roots of Jeffrey pine trees in a symbiotic relationship that helps the pine absorb water and provides nutrients to the fungi. Jeffrey pine forests also surround the Inyo Craters and Mammoth Mountain. Mule deer, coyotes, black bears, yellow-bellied marmots, raccoons and mountain lions all have ranges that are coincident with forests that cover parts of the Mono–Inyo craters.|$|E
50|$|Mongooses live in <b>scrublands</b> and dry forest. On Pacific Islands {{they live}} in rainforests as well.|$|R
50|$|It {{occurs in}} open forests and ecotonal <b>scrublands</b> or scrub-steppes, chiefly in the Chilean Matorral ecoregion.|$|R
50|$|Xeric or desert <b>scrublands</b> {{occur in}} the world's deserts and xeric shrublands ecoregions, or in areas of fast-draining sandy soils in more humid regions. These <b>scrublands</b> are {{characterized}} by plants with adaptations to the dry climate, which include small leaves to limit water loss, thorns {{to protect them from}} grazing animals, succulent leaves or stems, storage organs to store water, and long taproots to reach groundwater.|$|R
5|$|The black-throated gray warbler breeds in open {{coniferous}} {{and mixed}} forest with a brushy understory, in dry open oak forests, and in chaparral and other <b>scrubland.</b> It is particularly associated with pinyon pines, junipers, and oaks. It migrates {{to the south}} late in the fall, returning north in mid-spring. While migrating, it forages in any woodland or scrub it passes through. In its wintering grounds, it occurs in dry woodland and tall scrub. Though its status is not well known, {{it does not appear}} to be seriously threatened by habitat destruction or other human activities, unlike many migratory warblers. It is a fairly common bird, among the most common in some localities. Because it is common and not in rapid decline, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The grey currawong {{is found}} in wet and dry sclerophyll forests across its range, as well as mallee <b>scrubland,</b> and open areas such as parks or {{farmland}} near forested areas. It also inhabits pine plantations. Preferences vary between regions; subspecies versicolor {{is more common in}} wetter forests in southeastern mainland Australia, while the Tasmanian subspecies arguta is found most commonly in lowland dry sclerophyll forest. The subspecies melanoptera and intermedia are found mainly in mallee scrublands and woodlands, while in Western Australia, subspecies plumbea {{is found in}} various forests and woodlands, such as jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), karri (E.diversicolor), tuart (E.gomphocephala) and wandoo (E.wandoo), as well as paperbark woodlands around swampy areas, and acacia shrublands dominated by summer-scented wattle (Acacia rostellifera) and mulga (Acacia aneura) with Eremophila understory.|$|E
5|$|The white-winged fairywren mainly eats insects, supplementing {{this with}} small fruits and leaf buds. It occurs in {{heathland}} and arid <b>scrubland,</b> where low shrubs provide cover. Like other fairywrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, and {{small groups of}} birds maintain and defend territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity but remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. Although not yet confirmed genetically, the white-winged fairywren may be promiscuous and assist in raising the young from other pairings. As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks petals from flowers and displays them to female birds.|$|E
