Hitoshi corrects her that his species is not omnipotent and while his people may be more advanced technologically, they are still inferior as a race compared to humans of Earth.

500|$|On 14 October 2009, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy {{announced}} Havers {{had joined}} the cast of Coronation Street as Lewis, a potential love interest for Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). A writer for What's on TV said Havers {{was to make a}} one-off appearance in December before continuing in the role throughout 2010. The show's executive producer, Kim Crowther, told Gareth McLean of the Radio Times that while the team was planning the Audrey and Lewis storyline, they decided they wanted to introduce someone who was very charming, and slightly younger than Audrey. Casting director June West considered various actors for the part, including Anthony Head, but she suggested Havers for the role as <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a big fan of the show. Crowther quipped, [...] "When you think of Nigel, you think of someone suave enough to charm you out of your high heels. Half the work is done." [...] Havers said he could not refuse the part because his character was fascinating and had an interesting story arc, and that being on the show had always been his ambition. Havers was initially contracted until July 2010 and he made his debut screen appearance as Lewis on 18 December 2009. In March 2010, Havers stated that he was keen to renew his contract, as he was enjoying his time with the soap.|$|E

[...] Zuckerberg stated to Oprah Winfrey that the drama and partying {{of the film is}} mostly fiction, {{explaining}} [...] "this is my life, so I know it's not so dramatic," [...] and that he spent most of the past six years focusing, working hard, and coding Facebook. Speaking to an audience at Stanford University, Zuckerberg stated that the film portrayed his motivations for creating Facebook inaccurately; instead of an effort to [...] "get girls", he says he created the site because he enjoys [...] "building things". However, he added that the film accurately depicted his real-life wardrobe, saying, [...] "It's interesting the stuff that they focused on getting right – like every single shirt and fleece they had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lovelace and Babbage had a minor {{falling out}} when the papers were {{published}} {{when he tried to}} leave his own statement (a criticism of the government's treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface—which would imply that she had written that also. When Taylor's Scientific Memoirs ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian Benjamin Woolley theorised that: [...] "His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her... because of her 'celebrated name'." [...] Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as Philosopher's Walk, as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.|$|E
