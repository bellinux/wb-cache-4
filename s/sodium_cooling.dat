50|$|The {{sleeve valve}} {{is a type}} of valve {{mechanism}} for piston engines, distinct from the usual poppet valve. Sleeve valve engines saw use in a number of pre-World War II luxury cars and in the United States in the Willys-Knight car and light truck.

The Scottish Argyll company used its own, much simpler and more efficient, single sleeve system (Burt-McCollum) in its cars, a system which, after extensive development, saw substantial use in British aircraft engines of the 1940s, such as the Napier Sabre and Bristol Hercules and Centaurus, only to be supplanted by the jet engine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{complexity}} of present day embedded systems (continuous processes controlled by digital processors), {{and the increased}} demands on their reliability motivate the need for monitoring and fault isolation capabilities in the embedded pro-cessors. This paper develops monitoring, prediction, and fault isolation methods for abrupt faults in complex dynamic systems. The transient behavior in response to those faults is analyzed in a qualitative framework using parsimonious topological system models. Predicted transient effects of hypothesized faults are captured {{in the form of}} signatures that specify future faulty behavior as higher order time-derivatives. The dynamic effects of faults are analyzed by a progressive monitoring scheme till transient analysis mechanisms have to be suspended in favor of steady state analysis.

40|$|Residual sodium {{is defined}} as sodium metal that remains behind in pipes, vessels, and tanks after the bulk sodium metal has been melted and drained from such components. The {{residual}} sodium has the same chemical properties as bulk sodium, and differs from bulk sodium only in {{the thickness of the}} sodium deposit. Typically, sodium is considered residual when the thickness of the deposit is less than 5 - 6 cm. This residual sodium must be removed or deactivated when a pipe, vessel, system, or entire reactor is permanently taken out of service, {{in order to make the}} component or system safer and/or to comply with decommissioning regulations. As an alternative to the established residual sodium deactivation techniques (steam-and-nitrogen, wet vapor nitrogen, etc.), a technique involving the use of moisture and carbon dioxide has been developed. With this technique, sodium metal is converted into sodium bicarbonate by reacting it with humid carbon dioxide. Hydrogen is emitted as a by-product. This technique was first developed in the laboratory by exposing sodium samples to humidified carbon dioxide under controlled conditions, and then demonstrated on a larger scale by treating residual sodium within the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II) secondary cooling system, followed by the primary cooling system, respectively. The EBR-II facility is located at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in southeastern Idaho, U. S. A. This report is Part 1 of a two-part report. It is divided into three sections. The first section describes the chemistry of carbon dioxide-water-sodium reactions. The second section covers the laboratory experiments that were conducted in order to develop the residual sodium deactivation process. The third section discusses the application of the deactivation process to the treatment of residual sodium within the EBR-II secondary <b>sodium</b> <b>cooling</b> system.

40|$|General {{safety aspects}} of fuels under {{development}} for accelerator driven systems (ADSs) are reviewed and discussed.

The accumulated knowledge on data, phenomena and scenarios of fast reactors with (U,Pu) O 2 oxide fuels and <b>sodium</b> <b>cooling</b> serves as background for this review. For future ADSs both the reactor system itself, the fuel and the coolant are innovative compared to traditional critical fast reactors. For the fuel, these boundary conditions lead to many open questions, starting from basic thermal physical, thermal mechanical and irradiation data to the behavior under transient conditions. The choice of fuel naturally has {{a significant impact on}} whole core behavior and safety too, including the influence on related neutronics parameters, on failure propagation and disruption behavior under accident conditions. Key safety issues are discussed and a first assessment of phenomena and scenarios is given.

40|$|The SIMMER-III {{code was}} {{originally}} {{developed for the}} safety analysis of core disruptive accident in sodium cooled fast breeder reactor. In parallel to its development, a systematic programme of evaluation was successfully performed. Using the new detailed pin modelling, SIMMER-III is now able to describe a complete sequence of accident for sodium cooled fast reactor. Some tests of the international CABRI programme were successfully recalculated. Applications to a total sodium blockage in PHENIX reactor or to the fuel removal by control guide tube in Super-PHENIX were also investigated. In a recent past, SIMMER-III applications have been extended to gas cooled reactor analysis. These concern not only the 1970 ’s projects but also the current studies in progress on innovative core concepts for gas cooled fast reactors. Transients (depressurisation, loss of flow,…) have been simulated on SIMMER-III code and results compared to those of previous studies. Modelling of new fuel core in steady-state and degradation phases, foreseen for the future gas cooled reactor, is being realised {{in order to be}} added to SIMMER-III code. SIMMER-III has also been extensively applied for the safety analysis of critical fast burner reactors with <b>sodium</b> <b>cooling</b> within the CAPRA/CADRA program and now for accelerator driven systems (ADS). Due to the potentialities of SIMMER-III code to represent interactions between hot components in multi-phase flows, interaction between lithium-lead and water in a fusion reactor blanket, has been analysed. Results of dedicated experiments (BLAST, LIFUS) have been successfully reproduced by SIMMER-III. In conclusion, SIMMER-III code is flexible to be used for a variety of applications in reactor safety in order to study their behaviour under different transients...|$|E

40|$|ASTRID project, French sodium cooled {{nuclear reactor}} of 4 th generation, is under {{development}} at the moment by Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). In this project, development of monitoring techniques for a nuclear reactor during operation are identified as a measure issue for enlarging the plant safety. Use of ultrasonic measurement techniques (e. g. thermometry, visualization of internal objects) are regarded as powerful inspection tools of sodium cooled fast reactors (SFR) including ASTRID due to opacity of liquid sodium. In side of a <b>sodium</b> <b>cooling</b> circuit, heterogeneity of medium occurs because of complex flow state especially in its operation and then {{the effects of this}} heterogeneity on an acoustic propagation is not negligible. Thus, it is necessary to carry out verification experiments for developments of component technologies, while such kind of experiments using liquid sodium may be relatively large-scale experiments. This is why numerical simulation methods are essential for preceding real experiments or filling up the limited number of experimental results. Though various numerical methods have been applied for a wave propagation in liquid sodium, we still do not have a method for verifying on three-dimensional heterogeneity. Moreover, in side of a reactor core being a complex acousto-elastic coupled region, it has also been difficult to simulate such problems with conventional methods. The objective {{of this study is to}} solve these 2 points by applying three-dimensional spectral element method. In this paper, our initial results on three-dimensional simulation study on heterogeneous medium (the first point) are shown. For heterogeneity of liquid sodium to be considered, four-dimensional temperature field (three spatial and one temporal dimension) calculated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with Large-Eddy Simulation was applied instead of using conventional method (i. e. Gaussian Random field). This three-dimensional numerical experiment yields that we could verify the effects of heterogeneity of propagation medium on waves in Liquid sodium...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Sodium</b> <b>cooled</b> {{fast breeder}} {{reactors}} constitute {{the second stage}} of India’s three-stage nuclear energy programme, for effective utilization of the country’s limited reserves of natural uranium and exploitation of its large reserves of thorium. The Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research was established at Kalpakkam, 80 km south of Chennai (India) in 1971, with the mission to develop the technology of <b>sodium</b> <b>cooled</b> fast reactors. The heart of this Centre is the Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR), a <b>sodium</b> <b>cooled</b> test reactor, built to serve as a test bed for irradiation of fast reactor fuels and materials and to provide experience in large scale sodium handling and fast reactor operation. FBTR was built on the lines of the French Rapsodie-Fortissimo reactor. It went critical in Oct 1985 with a small core having 22 fuel subassemblies having a unique, high Pu monocarbide fuel. The core has been progressively expanded by loading additional fuel to compensate for reactivity loss due to burn-up. The current core has 48 fuel subassemblies of three different compositions, in addition to a test fuel subassembly simulating the composition of MOX fuel of the power breeder reactor. The high Pu carbide has reached a burn-up of 155 GWd/t without clad failure. During more than two decades of operation, FBTR has provided valuable experience which has been a major feedback in the launching of the 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) at Kalpakkam. The paper gives an overview of the operating experience of FBTR, including the performance of the systems, experiments carried out, major incidents and major system modifications to improve the reactor availability. 1...|$|R
