5|$|A {{letter written}} by former New Mexico Territory Governor Miguel Otero in 1940 appears to {{indicate}} that Earp had <b>strong</b> <b>feelings</b> for Josephine in April 1882. After leaving Tombstone following the Earp Vendetta Ride, the Earp posse went to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for two weeks. While there, Wyatt stayed with prominent businessman Henry N. Jaffa, who was also president of New Albuquerque’s Board of Trade. Like Josephine, Jaffa was Jewish.|$|E
5|$|Although Finn {{has chosen}} {{to stay on the}} {{football}} team, all the other dual members instead quit to remain in the glee club. Ken reverses his ultimatum after a conversation with a dismayed Finn and cancels the extra practice, allowing the football players to again do both activities. Meanwhile, Will and Emma spend more time together while Will prepares the mash-up, and soon realize they have <b>strong</b> <b>feelings</b> for one another. Will decides to remove himself from the equation and later tells Emma and Ken that he {{will not be able to}} create their mash-up.|$|E
5|$|Lucas is {{an admirer}} of English poet and painter William Blake; Elizabeta reveals that Lucas' admiration of Blake is based on their common {{distrust}} of systems. Lucas decorates his flat with some of Blake's paintings, and has a chest tattoo resembling The Ancient of Days, one of Blake's watercolour paintings. Though no longer married to Elizabeta, he maintains <b>strong</b> <b>feelings</b> towards her throughout {{the first half of}} series seven.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that many {{practitioners}} of varying theoretical stripes regard in-session <b>strong</b> client <b>feeling</b> as an important lever for psychotherapeutic change, there has been almost no research on how therapists can help bring about these <b>strong</b> <b>feeling</b> events in their sessions, or how they can use them once they have occurred. Nowhere in the current literature are there research-generated, unabridged, richly descriptive category systems designed to show practitioners precise methods for promoting <b>strong</b> <b>feeling</b> in the session, and precise ways of using it once it occurs. The present study aims to begin filling these conspicuous gaps in the literature by addressing two research questions: (1) What therapist methods, employed under what in-session client conditions, are judged as helpful in promoting <b>strong</b> client <b>feeling?</b> (2) When <b>strong</b> <b>feeling</b> occurs in the session, how do therapists use it? The research strategy will be an inductive, discovery-oriented approach, emphasizing knowledge generation, rather than explicit hypothesis-testing. The data will consist of audiotaped sessions of individual psychotherapy that contain multiple instances of <b>strong</b> <b>feeling,</b> and that are conducted by distinguished therapists representative of a broad range of therapeutic approaches. The potential value of the findings for psychotherapeutic practice is that they will offer a richly detailed collection of procedural, technical knowledge that practitioners can readily add to their therapeutic arsenals if they so wish. The findings may also enable theorizing about the relationships between therapist methods, occurrences of <b>strong</b> <b>feeling,</b> and subsequent therapist uses, and provide empirical data that future researchers may confirm and/or extend toward a more scientifically-based technology of how to promote and use <b>strong</b> <b>feeling</b> in the session...|$|R

5|$|Some {{cultural}} disputes {{exist between}} Malaysia and neighbouring countries, notably Indonesia. The two countries {{have a similar}} cultural heritage, sharing many traditions and items. However, disputes have arisen over things ranging from culinary dishes to Malaysia's national anthem. <b>Strong</b> <b>feelings</b> exist in Indonesia about protecting their national heritage. The Malaysian government and the Indonesian government have met to defuse some of the tensions resulting from the overlaps in culture. Feelings are not as strong in Malaysia, where most recognise that many cultural values are shared.|$|E
5|$|Summer Hill has {{a mix of}} Federation-era houses, with medium density {{apartment}} blocks near the railway station. Local independent business people run most of the shops. The local council has defined a village character for the suburb. Summer Hill is a suburb rich in heritage. More than one hundred properties are heritage listed, and the <b>strong</b> <b>feelings</b> of some residents of the suburb towards protecting the local architecture has seen {{the introduction of a}} heritage review, which is expected to add more properties to the heritage register.|$|E

The Irish Times {{reported}} that on the night following the attack, the British ambassador Sir Arthur Galsworthy was summoned to hear the Government of Ireland's <b>strong</b> <b>feelings</b> regarding {{the murder of the}} three band members. The government held the view that the British Government had not done enough to stop sectarian assassinations in Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Duchesne {{now called}} on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd {{to counter the}} defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had {{suddenly}} abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane {{and said that he}} was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out <b>strong</b> <b>feelings</b> of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able {{to understand the nature of}} what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.|$|E
5|$|Glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has {{the club}} split up into pairs to sing ballads to one another. As Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton) is absent, Will {{is forced to}} take his place and sing with Rachel (Lea Michele), who develops a crush on him. Will is dismayed, remembering Suzy Pepper (Sarah Drew), the last student who had such <b>strong</b> <b>feelings</b> for him. When her feelings were not reciprocated, she was so distraught she ate an extremely hot pepper from Mexico, was hospitalized, and had to have an esophagus transplant. Rachel visits Will's apartment, where his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) puts her to work cooking and cleaning. After an encounter with Suzy Pepper, during which Suzy explains {{that the two of them}} are similar and that chasing after Will won't repair Rachel's self-esteem, Rachel realizes her feelings for Will reflect her concerns about her own self-worth, and apologizes for her behavior. Afterward, Will assures her that she will find the man of her dreams who loves her for who she is.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} episode, Big Boo and Doggett's {{friendship}} continues to develop. Seeing that Doggett bears <b>strong</b> <b>feelings</b> of guilt {{relating to the}} six abortions that she has had, Big Boo makes reference to the book Freakonomics, which suggests that crime rates in the 1990s fell because of Roe v. Wade. Following Lorna Morello (played by Yael Stone) being relieved of her duty of driving the prison van, the role is given to Doggett. She comes into contact {{with one of the}} new correctional officers called Charlie Coates (played by James McMenamin). Coates is initially friendly towards Doggett. Despite relationships between prison staff and prisoners being forbidden, Coates kisses Doggett, against her will, after feeding some ducks. Following another outing, Coates gets in trouble with his boss Joe Caputo (played by Nick Sandow) for being late for count and is placed on probation. Doggett apologises for having caused him trouble, and he rapes her {{in the back of the}} prison van.|$|E

5|$|The Outlaw Star manga {{series and}} {{animated}} television series are paced differently. The anime episodes often involve Gene and his comrades taking on various jobs or missions to fund their ship's massive maintenance costs. Throughout their travels, the crew often encounters Ronald MacDougall and Harry MacDougall, {{a pair of}} bounty hunters {{responsible for the death}} of Gene's father. Ronald acts as a rival to Gene, while Harry wishes to form a bond with Melfina, a bio-android like himself, who instead develops <b>strong</b> <b>feelings</b> for Gene. The crew also contends with others that learn of the Outlaw Star's connection to the Galactic Leyline. They are Nguyen Khan, a scientist wishing to gain omniscience through the Leyline; and Lord Hazanko, the leader of the ruthless assassin organization the Anten Seven that seek the Leyline to gain ultimate power. The series climaxes when all parties meet on the physical plane of the Leyline. In the end, Ron MacDougall retreats, saved by a computer copy of his brother Harry (who is killed trying to protect Melfina from Hazanko), Khan is integrated into the Leyline as data, Gene reveals to Melfina that he is in love with her and frees her from the Leyline by making it their shared wish to be together forever, and Hazanko is eventually defeated by the Outlaw Star crewmembers. Once the conflict comes to a close, Gene and his friends return to Sentinel III and go their separate ways, but ultimately reunite to continue their adventures together.|$|E

25|$|During sleep, {{a person}} is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a {{sleeping}} person {{to a person who}} is overtaken by <b>strong</b> <b>feelings</b> toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. When {{a person is}} asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by <b>strong</b> <b>feelings.</b> Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.|$|E

25|$|Several {{factors are}} found to modify the {{negative}} effects of adverse life situations. Many studies show that the primary factor is to have relationships that provide care and support, create love and trust, and offer encouragement, both within and outside the family. Additional factors are also associated with resilience, like the capacity to make realistic plans, having self-confidence and a positive self image, developing communications skills, and the capacity to manage <b>strong</b> <b>feelings</b> and impulses.|$|E

In 2006, Swett's Medal of Honor action was recreated using computer graphics for The History Channel series Dogfights and Swett himself provided commentary. The episode first aired on November 24, 2006.|$|E
25|$|Worf avoided romantic {{attachments}} with non-Klingons {{during his}} first few years on board the Enterprise-D. As Worf explained to both Commander Riker and Guinan, he felt that non-Klingon females would be too fragile, {{and that he would}} have to restrain himself too much. He eventually developed <b>strong</b> <b>feelings</b> for Counselor Deanna Troi, and explored a relationship with her for a time, which at times strained his relationship with her former romantic interest, Commander Riker. Worf and Troi ended their relationship following the destruction of the Enterprise-D at Veridian III and Worf's reassignment to Deep Space Nine.|$|E
25|$|Brand may be {{best known}} for wrongfully {{terminating}} men's head basketball coach Bob Knight in 2000. Reactions to the firing were varied; public opinion was split with <b>strong</b> <b>feelings</b> {{one way or the}} other common across the state. The night of the firing a crowd estimated at 2,000, consisting mostly of students, vandalized the Showalter Fountain, the university football field, and marched on the president's on-campus home, the Bryan House. During this unrest, Brand was hanged in effigy. Despite his effectiveness as a fundraiser, Brand's firing of Bobby Knight caused his popularity among students and alumni to plummet.|$|E
