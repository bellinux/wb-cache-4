40|$|ObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} outcomes of surgery for active infective endocarditis in a large cohort of patients. MethodsThree hundred eighty-three consecutive patients underwent surgery for active infective endocarditis. The mean age was 51 ± 16 years, and 64 % were men. The infected valve was native in 266 patients and prosthetic in 117. Staphylococcus aureus {{was the most common}} microorganism. Surgery consisted of valve replacement or repair in patients with infection limited to the cusps or leaflets of the valve or radical resection of seemingly infected paravalvular tissues, and reconstruction with patches and valve replacement in patients with abscess (135 patients). The mean follow-up was 6. 1 ± 5. 2 years. ResultsThere were 45 (12 %) operative and 88 (23 %) late deaths. The operative mortality did not change during the period of study. Preoperative <b>shock,</b> prosthetic <b>valve</b> endocarditis, paravalvular abscess, and S aureus were independent predictors of operative mortality. Age, <b>shock,</b> prosthetic <b>valve</b> endocarditis, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40 %, and recurrent endocarditis were independent predictors of death from all causes. Survivals at 15 years were 44 % ± 5 % overall, 59 % ± 5 % for native valve endocarditis, and 25 % ± 7 % for prosthetic valve endocarditis (P =. 001). Freedom from recurrent endocarditis at 15 years was 86 % ± 3 % for all patients, similar to those for native and prosthetic valve endocarditis (P =. 39).

40|$|The {{pressure}} control valves can perform different {{functions in the}} hydraulic systems, such as: establish maximum pressure, reduce pressure in some circuit lines, and establish sequence movements, among other functions. The main operation of these valves consists of providing a balance between pressure and the force load on a spring.

50|$|The bumpers on the 1933 Series 355C were sectioned, with plain {{ends and}} a three bar center. The grille was made V-shaped and blended into the painted (chrome optional) {{radiator}} shell. The radiator cap disappeared {{under the hood}} {{on the right side}} (same side as the oil level gauge). The fender tie bar, after a year's absence was sectioned and the center section was hidden behind the grille. Six horizontal doors replaced the vertical hood doors. Skirts were added to the front and rear fenders. The most significant change in body detail was the introduction of no-draft Individually Controlled Ventilation (ICV) or pivoting vent windows in the front doors and the rear quarter or rear door windows. In early production the front door window had to be lowered to disengage the channel at its front edge from the vent window to allow the vent window to pivot. In later production the sealing channel was attached to the door frame rather than to the window glass so that the vent window could be operated independently of the window glass. Windshield and rear quarter windows were made stationary. Absence of a windshield operating mechanism on the closed car allowed room to conceal the wiper motor behind the headboard. The cowl ventilator was baffled and drained {{in such a way as}} to be rainproof. Chassis changes were few and minor in nature. Controlled free wheeling was discontinued. Vacuum assist was added to the brake system. Changes in <b>shock</b> absorber <b>valves</b> extended the range of the ride control system.

Based on the principles of fluid mechanics and thermodynamics, gas dynamics arises from the studies of gas flows in transonic and supersonic flights. To distinguish itself from other sciences in fluid dynamics, the studies in gas dynamics are often defined with gases flowing around or within physical objects at speeds comparable to or exceed the speed of sound and causing a significant change in temperature and pressure. [...] Some examples of these studies include but are not limited to: choked flows in nozzles and <b>valves,</b> <b>shock</b> waves around jets, aerodynamic heating on atmospheric reentry vehicles and flows of gas fuel within a jet engine.

The report covers the fundamentals of FSI analysis - methods of coupling uid and structure solution elds and methods for adapting the uid mesh to account for a changing geometry. A brief background on general moving/deforming mesh algorithms are presented but the emphasis lies on the methods available in ANSYS Fluent and how to apply these {{on the case of}} a <b>shock</b> absorber check <b>valve.</b> A moving/deforming mesh consisting of tetrahedral cells without ination layers on wall boundaries proves the most robust dynamic mesh setup. The exclusion of ination layers is shown to signicantly a ect the solution at low valve lift height. At full lift the exclusion of ination layers has no inuence on the solution. The check valve is 4 -fold axisymmetric but is shown to exhibit asymmetrical displacement. This is due to an asymmetrical uid pressure distribution on the check valve. Steady state FSI simulations show satisfactory correlation to ow bench experiments at low ow rates. The opening pressure di erential of the check valve, determined by the spring preload, is accurately predicted by the FSI model. At flow rates above 10 l/min the di erential pressure is under predicted, due tosimplications to the computational domain.

The reconstruction was done with fresh autologous pericardium in 30 patients, glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium in 56, and Dacron graft in 7. An appropriately tailored patch was sutured to the endocardium of the left ventricle or to fibrous skeleton of the heart, or to both. Sixty patients had had previous operation; most patients were in New York Heart Association functional class IV and 15 were in <b>shock.</b> The mitral <b>valve</b> was repaired in 10 patients and replaced in 83. Other procedures were aortic valve replacement in 40, tricuspid valve repair in 25, coronary artery bypass in 12, and replacement of the ascending aorta in 2.

40|$|In recent years, {{semi-active}} magnetorheological (MR) and electrorheological (ER) fluid technology based {{devices and}} {{systems have been}} developed and successfully utilized in many applications as <b>valves,</b> <b>shock</b> absorbers, dampers and clutch/brake systems. These promising devices have the adaptivity of the fully active systems to accommodate varying external excitations while maintaining the reliability and fail-safe features of the passive systems. Compared with ER based devices or systems, MR based devices have recently received special attention due to their high performance with minimal power requirements. Moreover MR fluids have significantly higher yield strength and are less sensitive to contaminants and temperature compared with the ER fluids. The geometric optimal design of MR valves/dampers {{is an important issue}} to improve the damper performance, such as damping force, valve ratio and inductive time constant. Considering this, the primary {{purpose of this study is}} to establish a general design optimization methodology to optimally design single–coil annular MR valves constrained in a specific volume in MR damper. To accomplish this, first the damping force of MR damper has been modeled using Bingham plastic model. The magnetic circuit of MR damper has been analyzed using finite element method in ANSYS environment to obtain magnetic field intensity which can be subsequently used to obtain the yield stress of the MR fluid in the active volume where the magnetic flux crosses. Then the developed finite element model of the MR valve is effectively used to construct an approximate response function relating the magnetic field intensity to the identified design parameters in the selected design space using response surface method and design of experiment methodology. Using the derived approximate relation for the magnetic field intensity in the MR damper model, the design optimization problem has been formulated using gradient based nonlinear mathematical programming technique based on the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) technique and also stochastic optimization technique based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find optimal geometrical parameters of the MR valve in order to maximize the damping performance under given constrained volume. Finally a PID controller has been designed to evaluate the close-loop performance of the optimally designed MR damper in a quarter-car suspension model. ...|$|R
40|$|Handling {{of heavy}} {{vehicles}} such as tractors, trucks and buses require a large roll stiffness which causes large high accelerations at the seat level during impacts. To provide comfort and minimize the energy transfer from the chassis and the seat a pneumatic active seat suspension is proposed. An active seat suspension design and control algorithm under {{development at the}} University of Illinois at Chicago, UIC, is being developed and tested. Preliminary results are presented in this paper. The design of a passive suspension typically consists of optimizing the value of two parameters: the stiffness and the damping of the suspension. The general dynamic performance of the suspension {{is limited to the}} conditions under which these parameters were obtained. A change in the input conditions might lead to poor suspension and an amplification of the vibration transmitted to the body. The focus of this paper is a robust, semi-active suspension system with a variable controlled damping and using the body response an index measure to minimize the acceleration at the interface of the seat and operator. A summary of existing suspensions, such as MR and ER fluids, and spring loaded and dual <b>valve</b> <b>shock</b> absorbent will be discussed to highlight the need of a semi-active pneumatic suspension system design. Methods A model of the proposed suspension was developed in MATLB (Simulink) and different control strategies for the valve position in relation to the cylinder pressure tested. The effects of stiffening and softening resulting from pressure changes in the cylinder were examined. The vertical accelerations of the seat was computed for different control strategies and configurations of the suspension and compared to the response of a passive seat suspension. A lump -mass model was created to represent the human body including the head, the upper, middle and lower torso as well as the legs. The connective forces between body segments were modeled through modal analysis techniques from previous experiments at the Vehicle Technology Laboratory. ISO standards and absorbed power were used to evaluate the different configuration of the seat suspension system in relation to the dynamic response of the operator. Results Initial results of the semi-active suspension system show a significant reduction in the RMS value of the acceleration of the seat. A reduction of the total absorbed power by the operator is expected to provide an insight into the control strategies adapted in the active suspension...|$|R
