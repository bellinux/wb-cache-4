Until then, only the director areas (Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester) and the adjacent non-director areas had the lettered dials; the director exchanges used the three-letter, four-number format. With {{the introduction of}} trunk dialing, the need for all callers {{to be able to}} dial numbers with letters in them led to the much more widespread use of lettered dials. The need for dials with letters ceased with the conversion to all-digit numbering in 1968.|$|E

50|$|As step offices became rarer, <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialing</b> Codes {{no longer}} {{followed}} the original rules, and were significantly revised in the mid-1990s, with further changes as wider use of mobile phones and non-BT competition {{came into the}} UK market. There are now some 70000 local exchange codes in use in the UK. The largest trunk carrier, British Telecom, connects the local network through some 60 transit (tandem) switches.|$|E
50|$|Telephone administrations {{in other}} {{countries}} implemented similar programs, {{such as in the}} United Kingdom, which led to <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling</b> (STD).|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling,</b> most Group Switching Centres housed operators in an Auto Manual Centre (AMC) who were able to place any calls for subscribers in the local area that could not be directly dialled. Operators continued to be used after {{the introduction}} of <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling</b> albeit on a reducing basis as direct dialled routings became increasingly available until universal direct dialling between U.K subscribers became available in 1979 via the Trunk Transit Network.|$|R

5000|$|Smaller schemes apply outside London. Uxbridge, for example, has the <b>subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialing</b> (STD) code 01895. Uxbridge {{exchange}} is the parent for Denham, Harefield, Ruislip and West Drayton; anyone connected {{to any of}} those exchanges can call {{any of the others}} without having to prefix the number with 01895. This is achieved by giving subscriber lines on each exchange different prefix numbers, thus: all numbers are six-figure; Denham numbers start with 83, Harefield with 82, Ruislip with 6 and West Drayton with 4. Uxbridge numbers start with 2 or 81. All calls must have all six digits dialled - even if a subscriber is on Denham exchange and is calling another subscriber on Denham exchange, they must still dial 83xxxx.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of DTMF, telephone numbers were dialed by users with a loop-disconnect (LD) signaling, more commonly known as pulse dialing (dial pulse, DP) in the U.S. It functions by interrupting the current in the local loop between the telephone exchange and the calling party's telephone at a precise rate with a switch in the telephone that is operated by the rotary dial as it spins back to its rest position after having been rotated to each desired number. The exchange equipment responds to the dial pulses either directly by operating relays, or by storing the number in a digit register recording the dialed number. The physical distance for which this type of dialing was possible was restricted by electrical distortions and was only possible on direct metallic links between end points of a line. Placing calls over longer distances required either operator assistance or provision of special <b>subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialing</b> equipment. Operators used an earlier type of multi-frequency signaling.|$|E

50|$|<b>Subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> (STD, {{also known}} as {{subscriber}} toll dialling) is a telephone system allowing <b>subscribers</b> to <b>dial</b> <b>trunk</b> calls without operator assistance.

5000|$|After {{taking charge}} as Chairman, Space Commission and Secretary, Department of Space in 1985, Rao {{accelerated}} {{the development of}} rocket technology [...] resulting in the successful launch of ASLV rocket in 1992. He was also responsible {{for the development of}} the operational PSLV launch vehicle, which successfully launched an 850 kg. satellite into a polar orbit in 1995. Rao initiated the development of the geostationary launch vehicle GSLV and the development of cryogenic technology in 1991. He was responsible for successful launch of INSAT satellites during his stint at ISRO. The launch of INSAT satellites gave a thrust to communications in India, during the 1980s and 1990s. The successful launch of INSAT provided telecommunication links to remote corners of India. During these decades fixed telephone (called as landline) expanded throughout country due to availability of satellite links at different places in the ground. People could talk easily from anywhere by use of STD (<b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialing)</b> instead of waiting for hours to get the connection. This development played a key role in future for India to develop as an Information Technology hub. He was the first Chairman of Antrix Corporation.he received Padma bhushana in 1976.|$|E

50|$|Before STD (<b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling)</b> codes were {{introduced}} in Northern Ireland, during the 1960s and 1970s, an operator based system was in operation. Each subscriber had short (usually 3 or 4 digit) number within the local exchange. For example, the post office in Dromore was Dromore 201.|$|R
50|$|<b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling</b> (STD) was {{introduced}} in 1958 to allow a caller to call another telephone directly instead of via a manual telephone exchange operator. Uniform exchange codes, usually called STD codes, were allocated for every exchange in the country, progressively as STD was rolled out. This process was not completed until 1979.|$|R

50|$|The {{change to}} all-figure {{dialling}} was controversial and was debated in both Houses of Parliament. Among the {{criticisms of the}} new system was the perceived difficulty in remembering telephone numbers, the inability to easily recognise where a telephone number was located and the need for a change so soon after the implementation of <b>subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rt Hon Ernest Marples was Postmaster General {{while running}} the {{telephone}} network {{run by the}} General Post Office, Marples introduced <b>subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling,</b> which eliminated the compulsory use of operators on national phone calls. On 2 June 1957, Marples brought in British postcodes and made the first draw for the new Premium Bonds. Marples was Minister of Transport (1959-1964).|$|R
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of <b>subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> each city with a Director system was assigned a 3-digit code, in which the second digit corresponded to the first letter of the city name on the telephone dial, {{with the exception of}} London which had the two-digit code 01. Codes were later changed (e.g., London became 020, and Manchester 0161).|$|R
50|$|In {{industry}} jargon, these area {{codes and}} prefixes {{are referred to}} as NDC codes (National Dialing Codes). This is the term used by ComReg and technical documents, as they include non-geographic codes. Historically, like the UK, the term STD code (<b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling)</b> was used.However, the terminology is archaic and is no longer universally understood and should not be used to avoid confusion.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, Harold Macmillan {{appointed}} Marples Postmaster General. At {{that time}} the telephone network was controlled by the General Post Office, and Marples introduced <b>subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> (STD), which eliminated the use of operators on national phone calls. On 2 June 1957, Marples started the first draw for the new Premium Bond scheme. He also introduced the first postcodes to the UK.|$|R
5000|$|The General Post Office issued <b>subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> (STD) {{codes for}} most areas {{during the late}} 1950s and early 1960s.

To help the public remember the new codes they were represented by a recognisable combination of two letters and a number. The letters and numbers corresponded as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|At this time, the {{majority}} of lines in rural, and regional areas (particularly in Scotland and Wales) were still manually switched. This inhibited growth, and caused bottlenecks in the network, {{as well as being}} labour and cost-intensive. The Post Office began to introduce automatic switching, and replaced all of its 6,000 exchanges. <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling</b> (STD) was also added from 1958, which allowed subscribers to dial their own long-distance calls.|$|R
5000|$|Merton Abbey's {{original}} {{telephone exchange}} code in the London director area was [...] "542" [...] (now [...] "(020) 8542"). Before {{the advent of}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling,</b> the area's alpha-numeric code was [...] "LIB", named after the local mill and written as, for example, [...] "LIBerty 1234". On the old Post Office telephone dials, the letters [...] "LIB" [...] corresponded to the numbers [...] "542", hence the modern exchange code.|$|R
50|$|American {{message unit}} {{counters}} generally had four digits, which sufficed {{because they were}} only used on local calls and most residential lines did not pay for local calls. Despite the arrival of <b>subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> (automatic long-distance dialing) in Europe, central offices there continued making and using message registers in the 1970s, designing ones that could register more than one click per second on a trunk call and display five or six digits.|$|R

50|$|Until 1995, {{calls to}} Malaysia from Singapore were direct, {{with only the}} area code and number being required, hence 03 for Kuala Lumpur instead of +60 3. In 1995, owing to the {{divergence}} of the two countries' numbering plans, the <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling</b> prefix 020 was adopted. For example, in order to call a number in Kuala Lumpur, 020 is dialled first, followed by the area code 3 (excluding the leading zero), then the subscriber number.|$|R
