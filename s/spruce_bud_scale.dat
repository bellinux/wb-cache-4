40|$|<b>Spruce</b> <b>bud</b> <b>scale</b> (Physokermes piceae Schrnk.) affects {{tree growth}} {{directly}} and indirectly. Direct injury {{appears in the}} form of tissue damage, as insects suck sap from tree phloem. Indirect injury appears as “honeydew”, which results in negative effects on tree growth. Plant sap is saturated with various carbohydrates called photosynthates that are difficult for scaly insects to digest. Therefore it is secreted in excrements, which are subsequently a food source for the black sooty mold (Apiosporium pinophilum Fuckel). The fungus covers needles blocking stomata, causing decreased transpiration and photosynthesis. An inexplicable wither of Norway spruce was reported in Latvia during 2010 due to black sooty mold. However, <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> <b>scale</b> was not evident. In 2011, mass propagation of <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> <b>scale</b> was observed following the 2010 Norway spruce loss. One objective of this research was to determine if Kraft tree growth classes could be applied to establish the factors responsible for tree foliage damage. Six 21 - 40 year old (second age class) Norway spruce stands were evaluated. Two circular sample plots with a 7. 98 m radius, and a 200 -m 2 area were randomly established per each forest stand hectare. Diameter at breast height (dbh, 1. 3 m), and height of approximately 30 trees was measured to model a trend. For all trees, Kraft class, and foliage damage level caused by <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> <b>scale</b> and black sooty mold were determined. Significant differences were not observed in tree damage levels among stands, however significant differences among damage levels in different Kraft classes were detected (F = 3. 45 > Fcrit. = 2. 80, α = 0. 05 > P = 0. 02) found. Overall damage intensity was 29. 3 %. Total forestry loss was 1153 LVL (1640 EUR) for all surveyed stands (10 ha), and 115 LVL (164 EUR) per hectare...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – <b>Spruce</b> <b>bud</b> <b>scale,</b> Physokermes piceae, {{develops}} on {{the genus}} Picea. Large colonies {{of this species}} are constantly present on Picea abies in green areas in the Belgrade territory, causing the drying of needles, branches and whole plants. Therefore, Ph. piceae is a significant spruce pest. Spruce scales attract many entomophagous insects able to reduce pest population. Parasitoid wasps Coccophagus lycimnia (Walk) (Aphelinidae) and Microterys lunatus (Dalm.) (Encyrtidae) were reared. Predators Exochomus quadripustulatus L., Scymnus abietis Paykull (Coccinellidae) and Anthribus nebulosus Forster (Anthribidae) were determined. Both species of ladybird were confirmed as predators of Ph. piceae {{for the first time}} in Serbia, while S. abietis is a new species for the fauna of Serbia. The most effective natural enemy of Ph. piceae was A. nebulosus, reducing populations by 68 - 80 %...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{diversity}} and composition of fungal communities in damaged and undamaged shoots of Norway spruce (Picea abies) following recent invasion of the <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> <b>scale</b> (Physokermes piceae) in Lithuania. Sampling was done in July 2013 and included 50 random lateral shoots from ten random trees in each of five visually undamaged and five damaged 40 - 50 -year-old pure stands of P. abies. DNA was isolated from 500 individual shoots, subjected to amplification of the internal transcribed spacer of fungal ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA), barcoded and sequenced. Clustering of 149, 426 high-quality sequences resulted in 1193 non-singleton contigs of which 1039 (87. 1 %) were fungal. In total, there were 893 fungal taxa in damaged shoots and 608 taxa in undamaged shoots (p < 0. 0001). Furthermore, 431 (41. 5 %) fungal taxa were exclusively in damaged shoots, 146 (14. 0 %) were exclusively in undamaged shoots, and 462 (44. 5 %) were common to both types of samples. Correspondence analysis showed that study sites representing damaged and undamaged shoots were separated from each other, indicating that in these fungal communities, these were largely different and, therefore, heavily affected by P. piceae. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that invasive alien tree pests may have a profound effect on fungal mycobiota associated with the phyllosphere of P. abies, and therefore, in addition to their direct negative effect owing physical damage of the tissue, they may also indirectly determine health, sustainability and, ultimately, distribution of the forest tree species...|$|E
50|$|The insect overwinters {{underground}} as a larva in a dark-brown papery cocoon {{encrusted with}} soil (Rose and Lindquist 1985). In the spring, the cocoon changes into a pupa, {{from which the}} adult emerges, mainly in May or June at {{about the time the}} <b>spruce</b> <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> are sloughed off. The spring-emerging females lay their eggs in shallow slits at the base of expanding needles, generally 1 per needle. Hatching takes place in 6 to 14 days, and the larvae feed in groups on the new needles until only short, brown stubs are left, after which the larvae move back on the twig to feed on the older needles until they are full-grown—usually in late July or early August. Larvae drop to the ground and spin overwintering cocoons. A single generation occurs per season.|$|R

40|$|Wintering flower buds of cold hardy Rhododendron japonicum cooled {{slowly to}} subfreezing {{temperatures}} {{are known to}} undergo extraorgan freezing, whose mechanisms remain obscure. We revisited this material to demonstrate why <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> freeze first {{in spite of their}} lower water content, why florets remain deeply supercooled and how seasonal adaptive responses occur in regard to extraorgan freezing in flower buds. We determined ice nucleation activity (INA) of various flower bud tissues of using a test tube-based assay. Irrespective of collection sites, outer and inner <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> that function as ice sinks in extraorgan freezing had high INA levels whilst florets that remain supercooled and act as a water source lacked INA. The INA level of <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> was not high in late August when flower bud formation was ending, but increased to reach the highest level in late October just before the first autumnal freeze. The results support the following hypothesis: the high INA in <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> functions as the subfreezing sensor, ensuring the primary freezing in <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> at warmer subzero temperatures, which likely allows the migration of floret water to the <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> and accumulation of icicles within the <b>bud</b> <b>scales.</b> The low INA in the florets helps them remain unfrozen by deep supercooling. The INA in the <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> was resistant to grinding and autoclaving at 121 °C for 15 min, implying the intrinsic nature of the INA rather than of microbial origin, whilst the INA in stem bark was autoclaving labile. Anti-nucleation activity (ANA) was implicated in the leachate of autoclaved <b>bud</b> <b>scales,</b> which suppresses the INA at millimolar levels of concentration and likely differs from the colligative effects of the solutes. The tissue INA levels likely contribute to the establishment of freezing behaviors by ensuring the order of freezing in the tissues: from the primary freeze to the last tissue remaining unfrozen...|$|R

40|$|Summary An {{accompanying}} paper {{reports the}} accumula-tion of photoactive protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) in the inner-most leaf primordia of buds of many tree species. In this paper, we describe plastid differentiation, changes in pigment con-centrations and spectral properties of <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> and leaf primordia of horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) from January {{until the end}} of bud break in April. The <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> con-tained plastids with grana, stroma thylakoids characteristic of chloroplasts and large dense bodies within the stroma. In Janu-ary, proplastids and young chloroplasts were present in the leaf primordia, and the fluorescence spectra of the primordia were similar to those of green leaves except for a minor band at 630 nm, indicative of a protochlorophyll(ide). During bud break, the pigment concentrations of the green <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> and the out-ermost leaf primordia increased, and Pchlide forms with emis...|$|R
40|$|Short day (SD) {{treatment}} {{is used as}} a dormancy induction in forest tree seedling nurseries in the boreal forest zone. However, SD treatment has caused early bud burst in the following spring, which may expose the seedlings to spring frosts. Because the mechanisms affecting earlier bud burst in SD treated seedlings are not fully understood yet, here we have studied the effect of SD treatment on the structure of <b>buds</b> in Norway <b>spruce</b> [Picea abies (L.) Karst. ] seedlings. Seedlings were exposed to SD treatments or natural (CTRL) light and photoperiod in July in a nursery in Central Finland. The experiments included two lots of seedlings over two summers and the analyses were done under a stereo microscope. SD treatment advanced initiation of <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> and formation of needle primordia, and thus the formation period was shorter in CTRL seedlings. In mature buds, no differences in primordial shoots were found between the treatments, whereas notable differences were found in <b>bud</b> <b>scales.</b> The SD <b>buds</b> had fewer and shorter <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> than the CTRL buds. This led to significantly shorter <b>bud</b> <b>scale</b> complex and, consequently, to shorter buds in SD than in CTRL seedlings. Buds and needles matured earlier in SD treated seedlings. In the following spring, the primordial shoots started to elongate in both treatments around mid-May, when the SD buds started to break down, whereas CTRL buds started to break down in late May. The fewer number and shorter height of protective <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> may expose <b>buds</b> to harsh winter temperatures and early loss of scales may predispose the SD buds to spring frosts...|$|R

50|$|The buds of many woody plants, {{especially}} in temperate or cold climates, {{are protected by}} a covering of modified leaves called scales which tightly enclose the more delicate parts of the <b>bud.</b> Many <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> are covered by a gummy substance which serves as added protection.

40|$|Axial homodromy {{in growing}} shoots of {{perennial}} plants with spiral phyllotaxis {{is the case}} when the chirality of phyllotactic pattern does not change in consecutive growth increments of the same axis. In conifers such as Picea or Abies this rule is strictly observed, except for the rare cases of discontinuous phyllotactic transitions. In Torreya, however, the chirality changes, at random, every year. The pattern of primordia packing, executed by vegetative shoot apical meristem (SAM), depends in Torreya on their identity. The primordia of <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> are initiated in the decussate and those of needles in bijugate spiral pattern. The decussate, achiral i. e. neutral pattern always precedes the formation of new spiral pattern and thus facilitates random selection of its chiral configuration. Periodic change in organ identity cannot itself {{be responsible for the}} special behavior of Torreya, because in other conifers it also exists. There is, however, one important difference: in Torreya, when the initiation of <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> begins at SAM, the distance between differentiated protoxylem and the initiation site gradually increases, while in other conifers it remains constant and small. In Torreya, at this phase of development, the rate of xylem differentiation and the rate of organogenesis become uncoupled. Closer anatomical examination shows that the decussate pattern in a <b>bud</b> <b>scale</b> zone develops slowly suggesting gradual decrease of the putative signal flowing acropetally from differentiated protoxylem, responsible for positioning of primordia. We hypothesize that in the absence of this signal SAM starts acting autonomously, distributing primordia according to their identity only. A constant presence of the signal in other conifers assures the continuation of the same phyllotactic pattern throughout the period of <b>bud</b> <b>scale</b> formation, despite the change in organ identity...|$|R
