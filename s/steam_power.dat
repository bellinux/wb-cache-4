5|$|The B's use of {{electrification}} {{instead of}} <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> in a Baltimore tunnel on the Royal Blue Line, beginning in 1895, {{marked the first}} use of electric locomotives by an American railroad and presaged the dawn of practical alternatives to <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> in the 20th century. Spurred by intense competition from the formidable Pennsylvania Railroad, the dominant railroad in the lucrative New YorkWashington market since the 1880s, the Royal Blue in its mid-1930s reincarnation was noted {{for a number of}} technological innovations, including streamlining and the first non-articulated diesel locomotive on a passenger train in the U.S., a harbinger of the steam locomotive's eventual demise.|$|E

50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>powered</b> saw mills were {{introduced}} in Sweden in 1849 at Tunadal. Twenty more <b>steam</b> <b>powered</b> saw mills were started in the decade. These sawmills were usually placed near ports and the former water powered saw mills were closed.|$|R
5|$|When <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> {{began to}} be used by the Yorkshire woollen {{industry}} the Severn Valley mills were at a disadvantage, since they did not have nearby supplies of coal.|$|E
5|$|Steam engines {{appeared}} in the United States {{as a source of}} power in the late 18th century, and living in Delaware and Philadelphia meant Evans was exposed to early examples of their application there. John Fitch had launched the first rudimentary steamboat onto the Delaware River in the late 1780s, and the Philadelphia waterworks was by 1802 operating two low-pressure steam engines to pump water from the Schuylkill River, but these were rare examples and most instances of this new technology were to be found in Europe. Much of the development of <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> had occurred in Great Britain, with Thomas Newcomen and James Watt instrumental in developing and commercializing <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> there and elsewhere in Europe, with several hundred of machines operating there in industrial and labor-saving applications by 1800.|$|E
5|$|The {{adoption}} of <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> {{was only one}} of a number of technological advances which revolutionized warship design in the 19th century. The ship of the line was overtaken by the ironclad: powered by steam, protected by metal armor, and armed with guns firing high-explosive shells.|$|E

5|$|Evans {{also began}} experimenting {{in this period}} with <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> and its {{potential}} for commercial application. His early ideas culminated in a Delaware state patent application in 1783 for a steam-powered wagon, but it was denied as Evans had yet to produce a working model. That same year, aged 27, Evans married Sarah Tomlinson, daughter of a local farmer, in Old Swedes' Episcopal Church in Wilmington.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries fleets had relied on {{two types of}} major warship, the ship {{of the line and}} the frigate. The first major change to these types was the {{introduction}} of <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> for propulsion. While paddle steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards, steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|The three ironclad ships {{selected}} differed {{substantially in}} design and degree of risk. Monitor was the most innovative design {{by virtue of its}} low freeboard, shallow-draft iron hull, and total dependence on <b>steam</b> <b>power.</b> The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had not previously been tested by any navy. Ericsson's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Navy's accomplishments {{paid off}} {{in the form of}} better funding, and it {{embarked}} on the construction of many new ships. However, the expense of the larger ships was prohibitive, and many of them stayed in shipyards half-completed, in readiness for another war, until the Age of Sail had almost completely passed. The main force of the Navy continued to be large sailing frigates with a number of smaller sloops during the three decades of peace. By the 1840s, the Navy began to adopt <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> and shell guns, but they lagged behind the French and British in adopting the new technologies.|$|E
5|$|Americans' {{eagerness to}} expand westward {{prompted}} {{a long series}} of American Indian Wars. The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's area. The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism. A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. Expansion was aided by <b>steam</b> <b>power,</b> when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{conductors}} {{and engineers}} often {{knew where the}} locals lived or were headed, trains would make non-scheduled stops to disembark passengers to allow them a shorter walk. In the 1960s, the number of round trips was reduced to three per day, allowing the whole service to be operated with a single unit. NSB used <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> for freight trains until 1970, when NSB's last scheduled steam locomotive service hauled a gravel train from Svene to Kongsberg. For a short period during the 1980s, there were also school trains, but as this forced NSB to operate two multiple units on the line, it proved too expensive and was soon afterwards again provided by bus.|$|E

5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as {{she was used to}} {{evaluate}} <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably because she could not pump the water out of her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled with {{the fact that she was}} too slow to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E
5|$|The Industrial Revolution {{started in}} Britain, {{with the use}} of plateways, canals and <b>steam</b> <b>power.</b> This led to {{dramatic}} increases in the productive capabilities of Britain, and created a need for new markets to sell its products. The Napoleonic Wars with France made this a difficult task, after Napoleon imposed the Continental System, which forbade his allies and conquests to trade with Britain. Thus Britain needed to be able to trade with the Spanish colonies, but could not do so because the colonies were restricted to trade only with their parent state. To achieve their economic objectives, Britain initially tried to invade Rio de la Plata and conquer key cities in Spanish America. When that failed, they chose to promote the Spanish-American aspirations of emancipation from Spain.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} {{initially}} operated by steam locomotives, however {{the cost of}} <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> was large; and on 7 June 1910 a contract with Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (today AEG) of Berlin was signed to provide overhead wires and five electric locomotives. The Rjukan Line became the second electrified railway in Norway, after the Thamshavn Line, and the first that would {{be connected to the}} main railway network. The first electric locomotive was taken into operation on 30 November 1911. Because only some of the locomotives were delivered, steam locomotive had to help with the service. Because of insufficient safety routines there were several fatalities among employees, and not until 1922 was sufficient policy initiated.|$|E

5|$|The {{slave trade}} and the {{consequent}} demand for cheap brass ware for export to Africa caused a boom in the copper and brass manufacturing industries of the Avon valley, which in turn encouraged {{the progress of the}} Industrial Revolution in the area. Prominent manufacturers such as Abraham Darby and William Champion developed extensive works between Conham and Keynsham which used ores from the Mendips and coal from the North Somerset coalfield. Water power from tributaries of the Avon drove the hammers in the brass batteries, until the development of <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> in the later 18th century. Glass, soap, sugar, paper and chemical industries also developed along the Avon valley.|$|E
5|$|The steamer put to sea on 19 November with {{ordnance}} {{stores for}} Fort Pickens, Florida, and {{vessels in the}} Gulf of Mexico, arriving off Southwest Pass, Mississippi River, after 11 December. Joining the Gulf Blockading Squadron at that time, De Soto patrolled for Confederate blockade runners near Barataria Bay. Given the sometimes light winds of the Gulf and inshore waters, the vessel's shallow draft and <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> gave De Soto an advantage over her mainly sail-powered prey. Cmdr. Walker's first month in the region began poorly, however, when his ship collided with the French war steamer Milan, then adrift off South West Pass, Mississippi River. Although damage to De Soto was slight, the Milan was disabled and thus needed a tow into the Union anchorage.|$|E
5|$|While both gun turrets were rotated by <b>steam</b> <b>power,</b> the new forward {{guns were}} loaded by {{hydraulic}} power, unlike the original guns which were hand worked. Thunderer {{was the first}} ship to have hydraulic loading gear. From 1874, the forward turret alone was converted to hydraulic power operation for training (turret traverse), elevation and ramming. This allowed the turret crew to be reduced from 48 to 28; the aft turret remaining hand-worked as a comparison. Power operation was considered successful, although it was later implicated in the 1879 explosion.|$|E
