40|$|International audienceNumerous talc, {{magnesite}} and siderite ore deposits {{occur in}} the Central Western Carpathians (Slovakia) along theso-called Gemer-Vepor Contact Zone, which marks the contact between two major blocks of Variscan basement,the Vepor and Gemer units. During the polyphase deformation of Cretaceous age, the Gemer Unit was first thrustover the Vepor Unit. This is well documented {{by the development of}} subhorizontal and prograde metamorphic foliationreaching up to amphibolite facies conditions in the Vepor and by the development of subvertical greenschistfacies cleavages in the Gemer Unit. The subsequent exhumation of the Vepor Unit along large-scale detachmentzone is documented by the development of subhorizontal lower grade cleavage in the Vepor Unit. Finally, the ongoingnorthward propagating convergence with the Gemer Unit {{led to the development of}} the sinistral transpressionalTrans-Gemer <b>Shear</b> zone. Two <b>types</b> of <b>shear</b> zones with contrasting metasomatic record have been recognized inthe Vepor Unit. Mg-enriched shear zones heterogeneously develop within the Carboniferous granitoids resulting information of Mg-chlorite–muscovite–quartz phyllonites as well as Mg-chlorite–kyanite-bearing schists. Comparedto the composition of granitoids, these mylonites-phyllonites are depleted in alkalies and enriched in magnesium,iron and manganese, which is most likely related to the influx of fluids along the shear zones. The equilibriummineral assemblage chlorite, kyanite, muscovite, rutile and quartz corresponds to 420 C at 4 kbar. In contrast,the second <b>type</b> of <b>shear</b> zones developed within chloritoid-kyanite schists of the Veporic Permian cover. Theseshear zones display metasomatic alteration characterized by a strong Fe-enrichment resulting in formation of Fechlorite-muscovite-quartz phyllonite. The unusual enrichment in either Mg or Fe suggests either heterogenous fluidcomposition or two separate metasomatic events in the studied area. Indeed, the two <b>types</b> of <b>shear</b> zones are associatedwith two distinct deformation events. The Mg-enriched first <b>type</b> <b>shear</b> zones are associated with progrademetamorphic evolution related to burial of the Vepor Unit whereas the Fe-enriched second <b>type</b> <b>shear</b> zones arerelated to the Vepor exhumation. Therefore, the formation of these metasomatic rocks reflects different stages ofthe polyphase Cretaceous evolution, rather than heterogenous composition of fluids. The sources of metasomaticfluids are discussed in relation to the nearby ore deposits...|$|R

40|$|In {{a dynamic}} and {{evolving}} society {{there is a}} need for temporary and mobile structures. For this, deployable scissor structures - structural mechanisms that can transform from a compact state to a fully deployed configuration - are suitable. However, this transformational capacity complicates the design process since there is a strong interaction between geometry, kinematic properties and structural response. In the conceptual design phase {{there is a need}} for more structural insight related to geometric aspects of deployable scissor structures. Toward this end, this research evaluates the influence of design parameters (height, span, structural thickness, number of units, and <b>scissor</b> <b>type)</b> on the structural behaviour (stress, deflection and mass) of scissor arches. A sensitivity analysis is first performed which determines the relative influence of each of these parameters. Then a comprehensive parametric structural study is performed to determine the best values for efficient (low mass) scissor systems. The result of this research is a set of guidelines to facilitate the design of competitive scissor structures and enhance further analysis and realisation.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} effects of fluid flow on shear {{localization}} and frictional strength of fault gouge {{through the use of}} a coupled 2 -phase (pore fluid-grain) Finite Difference-Discrete Element Numerical model. The model simulates slip at earthquake velocities (~ 1 m/s) in a fluid saturated gouge-filled fault. We find three <b>types</b> of <b>shear</b> behavior: (I) distributed shear, (II) random internal localization, and (III) boundary localization. Each <b>shear</b> <b>type</b> is dependent on the applied shear velocity, V, effective confining stress, N, and internal permeability, k. Through quantitative analysis of the positions and magnitude of localized shear bands, we show under which conditions the presence of and transitions between these <b>shear</b> <b>types</b> will occur. During shear, fluid pressure deviations, delta P, are generated by dilation and compaction cycles. The fluid effects on the system are more pronounced in simulations with higher V and lower N and k. Relative to the dry experiments, fluid saturated systems have an increased localization toward the boundaries of the gouge layer (type III), and no occurrence of distributed (<b>type</b> I) <b>shear.</b> Systems with lower N and k show liquefaction events. Liquefaction events originate from increases in fluid pressure, delta P, around force chains between grains. Once delta P, the high pressures weaken the frictional forces between grains and destroy force chains. Shear then occurs at essentially zero friction until a new grain configuration recreates force chains. A reduction in mean friction is seen for systems with large liquefaction events (without inclusion of thermal pressurization), which could introduce a new mechanism in low friction faults. We also find that systems undergoing different <b>types</b> of <b>shear</b> will all trend toward <b>type</b> (III) <b>shear</b> following a liquefaction event...|$|R

The following factors are investigated to figure out their influences {{on the performance of}} CFSTs, which are the width to thickness ratio of steel tube, thickness of steel plate, length of steel plate, strength of concrete, welding condition of steel plate, number of steel plate layer and interlayer spacing. The test results show that the ultimate bearing capacity and the elastic stiffness increase with decreasing width to thickness ratio of the steel tube, and increasing thickness and length of the steel plate. With increasing concrete strength, the ultimate bearing capacity also increases. However, the welding condition has no effect on the ultimate bearing capacity. The ultimate bearing capacity of the CFST with double-layer steel plate is greater than that with single-layer steel plate.

Due to this transformational capacity {{there is a}} mutual relation between the geometry, the kinematics and the structural response of the scissor system, resulting in a relatively complex design process. In order to understand how geometrical parameters influence the structural performance, it is beneficial to evaluate these structures at a pre-design stage. To reach this goal, we developed an integrated framework for pre-design evaluation using the parametric finite element tool Karamba in combination with Matlab. By doing so an automatic and immediate preliminary structural evaluation can be established that guides the designer in making efficient geometrical design decisions. This paper evaluates design parameters for deployable scissor arches using this framework. More specifically, {{the influence of the}} most important geometrical inputs - <b>scissor</b> <b>type,</b> number of <b>scissor</b> units, structural thickness and height of the arch - on structural performance (i. e. stress, deflection and mass) is determined.
