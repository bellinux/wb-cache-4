25|$|The {{landscape}} {{surrounding the}} city included rich agricultural fields and hill lands for pasture {{as well as}} woods. Smaller woods are still found outside the city, but in ancient times, they were far more widespread. This meant the inhabitants had an excellent supply of timber when building their houses and other structures. The fields provided the people with a <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> of wheat, barley and lentils. Flax was also harvested, but their primary source for clothing was sheep wool. They also hunted deer in the forest, but this was probably only a luxury reserved for the nobility. Domestic animals provided meat.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of the French conquest, rice was grown on a small scale. Before World War I, the Germans on the Cameroon side of the Logone River {{encouraged}} the spread of rice cultivation. By World War II, the French imposed cultivation in the areas of southern Chad near Laï and Kélo, along the Logone River. Although production was destined originally for colonial troops, the taste for rice spread in some localities. What was originally intended by the French as a commercial cash crop had become a local <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> by the 1980s.|$|E

50|$|Grains are {{the most}} {{important}} field crops and the chief element in the diet of most Ethiopians. The principal grains are teff, wheat, barley, corn, sorghum, and millet. The first three are primarily cool-weather crops cultivated at altitudes generally above 1,500 meters. Teff, indigenous to Ethiopia, furnishes the flour for enjera, an sourdough pancake-like bread that is the principal form in which grain is consumed in the highlands and in urban centers throughout the country. Barley is grown mostly between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. A major <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop,</b> barley is used as food and in the production of tella, a locally produced beer.|$|E

50|$|Chemical {{control of}} P. colocasiae has offered some {{relief in the}} form of {{preventative}} sprays containing copper, manganese, and zinc. The slanted shape of taro leaves, and prevalence of the crop in wet climates, necessitates numerous applications which may not be economically practical. The systemic fungicide metalaxyl has also been found to be effective in controlling P. colocasiae, especially when applied in conjunction with the pesticide mancozeb at the first sight of disease symptoms. While chemical control {{is one of the more}} effective methods of managing this pathogen, the fact that taro is usually a <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> makes chemical control economically impractical and environmentally unsustainable.|$|E

50|$|In early April 1979, the {{minister}} of agriculture, Florence Chenoweth, proposed {{an increase in the}} subsidized price of rice from $22 per 100-pound bag to $26. Chenoweth asserted that the increase would serve as an added inducement for rice farmers to stay on the land and produce rice as both a <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> and a cash crop, instead of abandoning their farms for jobs in the cities or on the rubber plantations. However, political opponents criticized the proposal as self-aggrandizement, pointing out that Chenoweth and the Tolbert family of the president operated large rice farms and would therefore realize a tidy profit from the proposed price increase.|$|E
50|$|Sanga is a farming {{community}} consisting mainly of <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> and livestock farming. Crops include nzungu, nyimo, chibage, mhunga, mapfunde, manhanga, mapudzi, magaka, sunflower, rice, ipwa, vegetables, water melons, beans and sweet potatoes. People also tried paprika and cotton but stopped. Livestock include cattle, goats, sheep, chicken, turkeys, hanga, ducks, pigeons (njivarungu), donkeys and rabbits. Some people also keep {{dogs and cats}} as pets and for hunting rats and rabbits. The Sanga market near Sanga School is near the Chadzire River. The Sanga Market is active {{for a few days}} {{at the end of each}} month. The main activity is cattle trading. Trading of goods and services is also vibrant. Such goods include beer, grain, clothing, artwork, hardware and kitchenware.|$|E
50|$|The {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea) {{originated in}} South America {{where it has}} long been domesticated. More recently it has been cultivated {{in other parts of the}} world and is an important <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa. Groundnut rosette virus was first described in Africa in 1907 and causes serious damage to groundnut crops on that continent. In 1939 it was reported to infect 80 to 90% of plants in the Belgian Congo causing major losses in yield. The virus can spread rapidly through a crop. In a study in Tanzania, the first affected plants were seen six days after the first aphids were observed. Aphid numbers built up rapidly and the disease increased tenfold in two weeks with 65% of the crop plants affected three weeks later.|$|E

40|$|Burundi {{is still}} {{experiencing}} a major food crisis. One important element {{that will help}} to avoid new episodes of violence is revised agricultural policies that support sustainable food security. Food crops and livestock supply 91 percent of agricultural GDP and the major livelihood for most households, thus {{it is essential to}} promote production and commercialization of <b>subsistence</b> <b>crops</b> and livestock. These subsectors currently perform poorly and foster a chronic food deficit, a condition that underlines the extreme vulnerability of the population to production-related risks. With food demand increasing {{at an annual rate of}} 3 to 6 percent, it is urgent to improve the contribution of the <b>subsistence</b> <b>crops</b> and livestock subsectors. The potential for improvement is great, and beyond the need for reforms that will benefit all sectors, improvements will require public investments to enhance productivity and better market access. Necessary changes in the short-run include fostering the use of high quality seed and fertilizer, and improving the management of small livestock. In the long run, research-extension links should be strengthened, producer organizations should be encouraged and supported, and sustainable land and water management practices should be promoted. Investments in infrastructure and market intelligence will need to meet demands generated by the development of urban centers and foster competitiveness of Burundian agricultural commodities relative to those from the region. This chapter explains the food security issue in Burundi and identifies priority actions that will help overcome the major obstacles that prevent growth and improvement of the <b>subsistence</b> <b>crops</b> and livestock subsectors. ...|$|R

50|$|Runaway {{communities}} {{flourished in}} almost all areas of Bahia, whose geography aided escape, {{and the result was}} a great number of fugitives and mocambos.In plantation zones, slaves often made up over 60 percent of the inhabitants. They lived in bad conditions in terms of food and housing and they had to deal with particularly cruel or sadistic masters. The region of Bahia in which appeared a great quantity of mocambos was the southern towns of Cairù, Camamù and Ilhéus. In these towns there was the most part of the production of manioc, the basic <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> of Brazil.A second and still unstudied method of slave control and capture in Brazil was the calculated use of Indians as slave catchers and as a counterforce to mocambos and possible slave resorts.|$|E
5000|$|More {{than half}} of Batswana (preferred address {{of the people of}} Botswana) live in rural areas and are {{dependent}} on <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> and livestock farming, together with money sent home by relatives in urban areas. Agriculture meets {{only a small portion of}} food needs and contributes just 2.8% to GDP—primarily through beef exports—but it remains a social and cultural touchstone. Cattle raising dominated Botswana's social and economic life before independence. The Botswana Meat Commission has a monopoly on beef production. The national herd was about 2.5 million in the mid-1990s, though the government-ordered slaughter of the entire herd in Botswana's north-west Ngamiland District in 1995 has reduced the number by at least 200,000. The slaughter was ordered to prevent the spread of [...] "cattle lung disease" [...] to other parts of the country.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{its many}} {{whitewashed}} buildings and structures, Tadjourah {{is known as}} the White City. Most people in the wider region are involved in marine commerce, including a large number of fishermen. The region has sandy beaches, tourism and trade. It exports salts from deposits around Lake Assal, one of the country's main natural resources. Tadjourah will soon have a modern port, complementary to that of Djibouti City and the fisheries industry is growing. The western half of it is steep valleys and high escarpments. Almost 65% of its area can be considered agricultural to the extent of seasonal grazing in many years and a minority of land in the wettest areas such as the south-western highlands near Randa near the south support year-round grazing and <b>subsistence</b> <b>crop</b> agriculture for a few months of the year, being mild and semi-arid.|$|E
