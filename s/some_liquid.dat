5|$|The chiral pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In <b>some</b> <b>liquid</b> crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.|$|E

Properties, Uses, Applications: CO2 Gas and Liquid Carbon Dioxide|url =http://www.uigi.com/carbondioxide.html|accessdate = 2009-07-26}} First, gases {{with a high}} {{concentration}} of carbon dioxide are produced. Such gases can be a byproduct of another process, such as producing ammonia from nitrogen and natural gas, oil refinery activities or large-scale fermentation. Second, the carbon dioxide-rich gas is pressurized and refrigerated until it liquefies. Next, the pressure is reduced. When this occurs <b>some</b> <b>liquid</b> carbon dioxide vaporizes, causing a rapid lowering of temperature of the remaining liquid. As a result, the extreme cold causes the liquid to solidify into a snow-like consistency. Finally, the snow-like solid carbon dioxide is compressed into small pellets or larger blocks of dry ice.|$|E
25|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} from multiple Martian missions for liquid water on Mars. There is good indirect isotope {{evidence from the}} Phoenix lander which shows that <b>some</b> <b>liquid</b> on the surface, likely to be water, has exchanged oxygen atoms with the CO2 in {{the atmosphere in the}} recent geological past. This evidence is not yet sufficient to determine whether this is due to intermittent flooding or flows, such as after geothermal or volcanic activity or meteorite impacts, or whether the liquid water is present every year, as in some of the recent suggestions for shallow subsurface habitats. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's imaging spectrometer has discovered the presence of hydrated salts in recurrent slope lineae – dark downhill flows which darken during warm seasons and fade during cold seasons. The seasonal changes of these flows are highly indicative of shallow subsurface movement of brine.|$|E
25|$|Aquaman's {{most widely}} {{recognized}} {{power is the}} telepathic {{ability to communicate with}} marine life, which he can summon from great distances. Although this power is most often and most easily used on beings that live in the sea, Aquaman has at times demonstrated the ability to affect any being that lives upon the sea (e.g., sea eagles), or even any being evolved from marine life (e.g., humans and some aliens). Before the New 52 Aquaman had access to a morphogenic field phenomenon called The Clear, an existential effigy that connects all oceanic and sea related life together as a whole, allowing him to empathize and share in the experiences of all aquatic based lifeforms. Per the 2011 DC continuity reboot, Aquaman's telepathy has been greatly downplayed: acknowledging that most marine life doesn't possess enough intelligence to carry a meaningful telepathic communication, Aquaman is now stated to simply add compulsions and needs in the mindset of aquatic life, compelling them to do his bidding by a subtle altering of their cerebellum. He has shown to have been blessed by the Sea God Poseidon possibly regaining a stronger but latent connection to The Clear when he was shown to bend the poisonous bile emitting from an old world structure that had intruded from the sea poisoning it with dark magic, developing <b>some</b> <b>liquid</b> manipulatory abilities. This blessing also gave him a protective charm against the foul magics of the Thule dimension it had originated from.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} common LC phases is the nematic. The word nematic comes from the Greek [...] (...) , which means [...] "thread". This term {{originates}} from the thread-like topological defects observed in nematics, which are formally called 'disclinations'. Nematics also exhibit so-called [...] "hedgehog" [...] topological defects. In a nematic phase, the calamitic or rod-shaped organic molecules have no positional order, but they self-align to have long-range directional order with their long axes roughly parallel. Thus, the molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid, but still maintain their long-range directional order. Most nematics are uniaxial: they have one axis that is longer and preferred, with the other two being equivalent (can be approximated as cylinders or rods). However, <b>some</b> <b>liquid</b> crystals are biaxial nematics, meaning that in addition to orienting their long axis, they also orient along a secondary axis. Nematics have fluidity similar to that of ordinary (isotropic) liquids but they can be easily aligned by an external magnetic or electric field. Aligned nematics have the optical properties of uniaxial crystals and this makes them extremely useful in liquid-crystal displays (LCD).|$|E
