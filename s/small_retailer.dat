60|$|The {{particular}} {{function of}} the British lodging-house--though the science of economics is silent on this point--is to use up the last strength of the trusty old servant and the plucky widow. These people will invest from two or three hundred to a thousand pounds {{in order to gain}} a bare subsistence by toiling for boarders and lodgers. It is their idea of a safe investment. They can see it all the time. All over England this process goes on. The curious inquirer may see every phase for himself by simply looking for rooms among the apartment houses of such a region as Camden Town, London; he will realize more and more surely as he goes about that none of these people gain money, none of them ever recover the capital they sink, they are happy if they die before their inevitable financial extinction. It is so habitual with people to think of classes as stable, of a butcher or a baker as a man who keeps a shop of a certain sort at a certain level throughout a long and indeterminate life, that it may seem incredible to many readers that those two typically thrifty classes, the lodging-letting householder and the <b>small</b> <b>retailer,</b> are maintained by a steady supply of failing individuals; the fact remains that it is so. Their little savings are no good to them, investments and business beginnings mock them alike: steadily, relentlessly our competitive system eats them up.|$|E

40|$|A hundred {{friends are}} {{worth more than}} a hundred rubles“ (Russian proverb). This {{research}} focuses on small retail businesses in nonurban, downtown areas of tourist destinations. These retailers, as well as the downtown in which they are located, have access to two intangible resources: local (social) capital between retailers and consumers and social network ties among retailers. Social capital and social network theory provide a theoretical foundation. The research first assesses the direct effects of these two independent constructs on downtown versus <b>small</b> <b>retailer</b> performance. Second, the authors argue that downtown performance impacts <b>small</b> <b>retailer</b> performance, making downtown performance a partial mediator. The impact of local capital and social ties on <b>small</b> <b>retailer</b> performance is thus hypothesized to be both direct and indirect, through downtown performance; this enables effects decomposition. Third, the authors explore whether the hypothesized relationships hold equally in tourist versus nontourist towns: are the strengths of the betas (i. e., the slopes) the same, given that tourist towns {{are more likely to be}} marketed? the results show that social ties impact downtown performance, which in turn impacts firm performance, but the strengths of paths are not the same across tourist versus nontourist towns.

40|$|The retail {{industry}} {{is considered to}} be a very competitive industry in the United States since there are so many players in the almost saturated retail markets that provide similar products and services at similar price levels to customers. Market selection has been identified as an important strategy to differentiate a retailer in this competitive market. Therefore in this thesis, we describe a conceptual framework to evaluate retailers investment opportunities in dynamic, competitive retail markets. The objective is to describe a conceptual investment analysis framework to address the strategic aspects of a retailer s investment opportunity as well as the dynamic uncertainty of a retail market in a single framework. This conceptual framework outlines a strategic view towards retail stores as flexible assets of a retail enterprise. This conceptual framework is general and can be adjusted and applied to investments options in other services. In addition, we develop an integrated investment analysis approach based on dynamic programming to explore retailers investment behaviors in dynamic markets. The objective is to determine retailers optimal investment thresholds in noncompetitive and competitive markets. We consider two retailers to illustrate our approach and use a simple game theory treatment to address competition in retail markets. We use our integrated investment analysis model based on a real options methodology to evaluate the apparent tendency for the small discount retailer invests earlier in a new developing market due to the competition effect from the large discount retailer. This early entry gives the small retail a first-mover advantage and delays the big retailer s entry into the competitive market. In addition, we conduct sensitivity analysis to characterize how significantly the values of our model parameters impact the retailers investment decisions. We also develop an integrated investment analysis approach based on contingent claims analysis to explore retailers investment behaviors in dynamic markets. The objective is to determine retailers optimal investment thresholds in noncompetitive and competitive markets. The equivalent risk neutral evaluation approach is presented in this thesis as an extended version of the contingent claims analysis approach, which facilitates the market-oriented valuation of the retailer s investment option in dynamic markets. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to study how retailers optimal investment thresholds change as the values of parameters in this equivalent risk neutral evaluation approach change. The relationship between the dynamic programming and the equivalent risk neutral evaluation approach is also summarized in this thesis to identify the similarities and the differences between these two investment analysis approaches. One of the most important objectives of this comparison is to determine in what market conditions the choice of investment analysis approach is critical and dramatically changes the retailer s optimal investment threshold. Finally, we empirically examine an important aspect of our theoretical work that the big retailer invests and opens a store relatively later in markets with a <b>small</b> <b>retailer</b> compared to markets without a <b>small</b> <b>retailer.</b> In addition, the big retailer opens a store at relatively higher retail market potential in markets with a <b>small</b> <b>retailer</b> compared to markets without a <b>small</b> <b>retailer.</b> In this thesis, we discuss some empirical evidence to support these theoretical results. We chose Wal-Mart and Dollar General as the big and small retailers, respectively, in our empirical study. Our empirical results do not validate the theory and just provide supporting evidence for our theoretical works. Ph. D. Committee Chair: William B.

40|$|In 1973, the French government, in {{response}} to considerable pressure from <b>small</b> <b>retailer</b> interest groups, introduced legislation aimed at restricting the future growth of large area retail stores. The "Loi Royer" established a series of departmental planning commissions composed of retailer, locally elected, and consumer representatives. These commissions were given the power to authorise or reject planning applications for large retail units and extensions to existing stores, above certain size thresholds dependent upon {{the size of the}} commune in which development was to take place. The law allowed for an appeal procedure in which the Minister of Commerce and Crafts, advised by a national commission of similar composition, was the final arbiter. This thesis examines the impact of the "Loi Royer", with particular reference to hypermarket development in France. The spatial and structural growth of large stores, and large retail organisations is assessed, with case studies undertaken on the application of the law in the Brittany region, and the growth of the Carrefour group. The role and form of public policy in the retail sector in general is also considered. The composition of the commissions and proceedures established by the legislation provided considerable potential for influencing the development of large stores in France. However, whilst the legislation has had some short term and localised impact upon hypermarket development, in the long term, the restrictive effects of the law must be questioned. By exploiting various loopholes and failings in the legislation, hypermarket openings have continued, and the large retail groups have maintained their growth largely {{at the expense of the}} <b>small</b> <b>retailer,</b> whom the law was intended to protect. The legislation may also have indirectly encouraged numerous strategic adaptions, on the part of the larger retail organisations, which have served to further improve their position vis a vis smaller retailers, or introduced large retail groups into sectors traditionally dominated by independent traders...|$|E

Three early Internet adoption stages are discussed and their impact on the customer relationship. Each stage has significant impact on some part of the relationship, which is divided into marketing, sales, service and customer satisfaction. Some significant findings include that the introduction of e-mail changes the marketing process to get more “reactive”, that the website needs cross-advertising (advertising the website offline and advertising the store online) and that a general increase in customer satisfaction is to be expected when offering different channels of customer service. In general, the changes are not always intuitive, but always possible to anticipate.
