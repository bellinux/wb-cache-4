40|$|I {{am always}} {{fascinated by the}} space created by an {{architectural}} opening. In the past, people simply adored window spaces. They created various attractive scenes to surround the window, such as sitting in a bay window, getting sunlight in a glazed alcove and looking at a garden through widely opened sliding windows. A {{hole in the wall}} is not just for letting air and lights in or to keep out rain and dust out, but an essential element that has numerous spatial qualities. In this book, I will focus on embodying a potential of a window into an interior component that broadens possibilities of space. What is the role of window space and how can this particular depth in a room evoke activity? Window Room creates an experience, which stimulates your senses. We have lost its depth and the unobtrusive framed view; windows have become huge glass walls and the walls tend to be thinner. After the loss of all atmospheric window spaces, how to bring this quality back, becomes my main challenge. My intention also lies on articulating the identity of a window as a room. During the process, I found out that there are many examples focusing on the existence of windows as a comfortable <b>seating</b> <b>place,</b> but not many of them dealing with it as another room that inhabit a room. The book consists of three parts. The first part explores various window features and scenes from paintings to architecture. The second part illustrates the concept of Window Room as a detached room in a room. The last part is about the execution of Window Room project...|$|E
