40|$|Political and {{organizational}} theories {{suggest that the}} turnover of chief executives {{and other members of}} <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>teams</b> are likely to be influenced by public service performance. We use a panel data set of 148 English local governments over 4 years to test this proposition. The empirical results show that performance has a negative effect on turnover, but that this effect is weaker for chief executives than for members of their <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>teams.</b> In addition, top team turnover is higher in the years following a chief executive succession. The evidence suggests that chief executives can influence top team turnover by attributing responsibility for poor organizational performance to other senior managers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{outlines}} {{research that}} was conducted among students, par-ents, teachers and <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>teams</b> in five {{high schools in}} the Greater Dublin area of Ireland. The research involved semi-structured interviews and observations. The findings of this research are significant in that {{it was the first time}} any data was gathered on this topic directly from those within the school system. Overall, the qualitative nature of the data allowed us to obtain an insight into how students, parents, teachers and <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>teams</b> understand and experience homophobic bullying in their schools. The data from this study shows that the impact of not having a mainstream approach to sexual orientation within schools results in fear, negative stereotypes, and worse still discriminatory and bullying behaviour...|$|R

500|$|The Churches Conservation Trust, {{which was}} {{initially}} {{known as the}} Redundant Churches Fund, is a charity whose purpose is to protect historic churches at risk, {{those that have been}} made redundant by the Church of England.

The legally defined object of the Trust is [...] "the preservation, {{in the interests of the}} nation and the Church of England, of churches and parts of churches of historic and archaeological interest or architectural quality vested in the Fund... together with their contents so vested". [...] The charity cares for over 350churches. [...] The Trust is financed partly by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Church Commissioners, but grants from those bodies were frozen in 2001, since when additional funding has come from other sources, including the general public. In the 12months ending 31March 2010 the charity's income was £6,161,653, and its spending was £6,035,871. [...] During that year it had 44employees, and used the services of 2,000volunteers.

40|$|In this dissertation, we {{evaluate}} the roles <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>teams</b> and individual middle managers play in realizing the performance benefits of entrepreneurial orientations. We investigate {{the role of}} <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>teams</b> by focusing on a sample of 9. 000 firms in the Netherlands. The first study focuses on antecedents of entrepreneurial orientation, i. e. internal and external knowledge acquisition of <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>teams.</b> We find that {{both internal and external}} knowledge acquisition are important and that a premium in terms of the entrepreneurial orientation of the firm may be obtained by simultaneously sourcing for both types of knowledge. Our second study presents a model for top <b>management</b> <b>teams</b> aiming to enhance the performance benefits of the entrepreneurial orientation of the firm. We investigate team attributes such as team heterogeneity and shared vision and find some compelling results with respect to their context specific applicability for leveraging the entrepreneurial orientation of the firm. Our final study, based within the European branch of a single firm operating at the intersection of hardware, software and IT consulting, examines the individual entrepreneurial orientation of middle managers and subsequent performance benefits. We find that strong network ties of relatively higher placed middle managers are instrumental for realizing the inherent value of entrepreneurial orientation. Together, our results emphasize the performance benefits that may be obtained if the entrepreneurial orientation of organizations and individuals is appropriately managed. Attention for knowledge acquisition, team composition, the environmental context as well as network ties and the hierarchical position of individual managers represent essential aspects of effective management of entrepreneurial orientations...|$|R
