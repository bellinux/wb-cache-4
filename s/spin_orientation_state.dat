40|$|The spin {{states at}} the surface of {{epitaxial}} thin films of hematite, both undoped and doped with 1 % Ti, Sn or Zn, respectively, were probed with x-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) spectroscopy. Morin transitions were observed for the undoped (T_M~ 200 K) and Sn-doped (T_M~ 300 K) cases, while Zn and Ti-doped samples were always in {{the high and low}} temperature phases, respectively. In contrast to what has been reported for bulk hematite doped with the tetravalent ions Sn 4 + and Ti 4 +, for which T_M dramatically decreases, these dopants substantially increase T_M in thin films, far exceeding the bulk values. The normalized Fe LII-edge dichroism for TT_M state was achieved. The temperature dependence of the critical field for the Sn-doped sample was characterized in detail. It was demonstrated the sample-to-sample variations of the Fe LIII-edge spectra were, for the most part, determined solely by the <b>spin</b> <b>orientation</b> <b>state.</b> Calculations of the polarization-depedent spectra based on a spin-multiplet model were in reasonable agreement with the experiment and showed a mixed excitation character of the peak structures.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{generalized}} Dirac fermion description for the electronic state of graphene terminated by a zigzag edge. This description admits a spin-orbit coupling needed to preserve time-reversal invariance of the zigzag confinement, otherwise, for spinless particles, showing the parity anomaly typical of quantum electrodynamics in (2 + 1) dimensions. At a certain critical strength the spin-orbit coupling induces a phase transition of the quantum-spin-Hall type. It is manifested by a novel type {{of the edge}} states consisting of a Kramers' pair of counter-propagating modes with opposite <b>spin</b> <b>orientations.</b> Such edge <b>states</b> are capable of accumulating an integer spin {{in response to a}} transverse electric field {{in the absence of a}} magnetic one. They exist without any excitation gap in the bulk, due to which our system stands out among other quantum spin Hall systems studied earlier.

30|$|The {{time needed}} to reduce the light {{intensity}} to e− 1 (36.8 %) of its original value {{is defined as the}} fluorescence decay time (τ). Luminescence can be divided into two groups: fluorescence and phosphorescence. Phosphorescence, also known as delayed emission, has a much longer decay lifetime than fluorescence. Typical phosphorescence lifetimes can vary from 100 [*]ms up to many seconds in duration, while the lifetimes of fluorescent materials usually range from 1 [*]ns to 10 [*]ms. More specifically, phosphorescence is the emission of light from a triplet excited state, where the electron in the ground state and excited state has the same <b>spin</b> <b>orientation.</b> The triplet <b>state</b> {{is due to the fact}} that the spin flips take more time to complete. Fluorescence occurs in singlet states, with the excited electron having the opposite spin of the paired ground state, resulting in a short emission time for photons. The fluorescence decay time is unique to each material. It might be possible to use the fluorescence decay time as an indicator to gauge the production of TL from impacts. Some materials such as ZnS:Mn,Cu have multiple decay times. Equation 1 would be valid over a limited range of times.|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of <b>spin</b> <b>orientation</b> by {{electric}} current in (110) -grown semiconductor quantum wells. The controversy in the factor of two from two existed approaches is resolved by pointing out the importance of energy relaxation in this problem. The limiting cases of fast and slow energy relaxation relative to spin relaxation are considered for asymmetric (110) quantum wells. For symmetricly-doped structures the effect of <b>spin</b> <b>orientation</b> is shown to exist due to spatial fluctuations of the Rashba spin-orbit splitting. We demonstrate that the <b>spin</b> <b>orientation</b> depends strongly on the correlation length of these fluctuations {{as well as on}} the ratio of the energy and spin relaxation rates. The time-resolved kinetics of spin polarization by electric current is also governed by the correlation length being not purely exponential at slow energy relaxation.

40|$|The {{helicity}} eigenstates which {{describe the}} fermions {{with a special}} <b>spin</b> <b>orientation</b> (parallel or antiparallel to the direction of momentum) provide considerable simplification in calculations. Hence, it is generally preferred to use helicity basis during the calculations in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics or Quantum Field Theory. Possibly because of the above reason, the Dirac spinors describing a general <b>spin</b> <b>orientation</b> have been ignored in many textbooks. Although the helicity eigenstates give almost complete understanding {{of the behavior of}} the free Dirac solutions, the zero-mass limit is one of its exception. The zero-mass behavior of the free spinor with general <b>spin</b> <b>orientation</b> and its relation with chirality eigenstates has been skipped in textbooks and hence it deserves a clear, detailed investigation. In this paper we obtain the free Dirac spinors describing a general <b>spin</b> <b>orientation</b> and examine their zero-mass limit.

40|$|We {{study the}} helical edge states of a {{two-dimensional}} topological insulator without axial spin symmetry {{due to the}} Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Lack of axial spin symmetry can lead to so-called generic helical edge states, which have energy-dependent <b>spin</b> <b>orientation.</b> This opens the possibility of inelastic backscattering and thereby nonquantized transport. Here we find analytically the new dispersion relations and the energy dependent <b>spin</b> <b>orientation</b> of the generic helical edge states {{in the presence of}} Rashba spin-orbit coupling within the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model, for both a single isolated edge and for a finite width ribbon. In the single-edge case, we analytically quantify the energy dependence of the <b>spin</b> <b>orientation,</b> which turns out to be weak for a realistic HgTe quantum well. Nevertheless, finite size effects combined with Rashba spin-orbit coupling result in two avoided crossings in the energy dispersions, where the <b>spin</b> <b>orientation</b> variation of the edge states is very significantly increased for realistic parameters. Finally, our analytical results are found to compare well to a numerical tight-binding regularization of the model. Comment: 21 pages (main text 11 pages), 11 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{preferred}} <b>spin</b> <b>orientation</b> of {{a magnetic}} ion can be predicted {{on the basis}} of density functional theory (DFT) calculations including electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, most chemists and physicists are unaware of how the observed and/or calculated <b>spin</b> <b>orientations</b> are related to the local electronic structures of the magnetic ions. The objective {{of this article is to}} provide a conceptual framework of thinking about and predicting the preferred <b>spin</b> <b>orientation</b> of a magnetic ion by examining the relationship between the <b>spin</b> <b>orientation</b> and the local electronic structure of the ion. In general, a magnetic ion (i. e., an ion possessing unpaired spins) in a solid or a molecule is surrounded with main-group ligand atoms to form a polyhedron, and the d-states of the polyhedron are split because the antibonding interactions of the metal d-orbitals with the p orbitals of the surrounding ligands depend on the symmetries of the orbitals involved. The magnetic ion of the polyhedron has a certain preferred spin direction because its split d-states interact among themselves under SOC and because the energy lowering associated with the SOC-induced interactions depends on <b>spin</b> <b>orientation.</b> The preferred <b>spin</b> direction can be readily predicted {{on the basis of}} perturbation theory, in which the SOC is taken as perturbation and the split d-states as unperturbed states, by inspecting the magnetic quantum numbers of its d-orbitals present in the HOMO and LUMO of the polyhedron. Experimentally, the determination of the preferred <b>spin</b> <b>orientations</b> of magnetic ions requires a sophisticated level of experiments. Theoretically, it requires an elaborate level of DFT electronic structure calculations. We show that the outcomes of such experimental measurements and theoretical calculations can be predicted by a simple perturbation theory analysis. Comment: 41 pages, 11 figures, a short revie...|$|R
