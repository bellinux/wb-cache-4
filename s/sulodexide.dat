40|$|Background Patients with Type 2 {{diabetes}} and albuminuria {{are at high}} risk to progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although angiotensin receptor blockers confer renoprotection, many diabetic patients still develop overt nephropathy and reach ESRD. Glycosaminoglycans belong to the same family as heparin and heparinoids. Pilot studies with <b>sulodexide,</b> a glycosaminoglycan, have shown that <b>sulodexide</b> can reduce urinary albumin excretion rates in diabetic patients. No hard renal end-point data are available. Methods Two multicentre, double-masked, randomized placebo controlled trials were designed to study the renoprotective potential of <b>sulodexide.</b> The <b>Sulodexide</b> Microalbuminuria Trial examined the efficacy of <b>sulodexide</b> given over 26 weeks in 1000 patients with Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and microalbuminuria. The <b>Sulodexide</b> Overt Nephropathy Trial examined the efficacy of <b>sulodexide</b> in 2240 patients with Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and proteinuria >= 900 mg/ 24 h. Results The primary outcome of The <b>Sulodexide</b> Microalbuminuria Trial was (i) conversion to normoalbuminuria and at least a 25 % decrease in the urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR), or (ii) at least a 50 % reduction in UACR.

40|$|<b>Sulodexide</b> {{represents}} a novel antithrombotic agent with multiple sites of action on blood coagulation and vascular processes. The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare <b>sulodexide</b> and enoxaparin on anticoagulant effects, tissue factor (TF) -induced activation of plate-lets, inhibition of microparticle generation and to investigate their effect on heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA). <b>Sulodexide</b> was compared with enoxaparin at equigravimetric concentrations. When compared to enoxaparin, <b>sulodexide</b> produced a stron-ger anticoagulant effect in the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), Heptest, and thrombin time (TT) assays. In addition, <b>sulodexide</b> had a stronger inhibitory effect on TF-mediated microparticle generation (IC 50 2. 8 mg/ mL), P-selectin expression (IC 50 4. 8 mg/ml), and pla-telet aggregate formation (IC 50 8. 5 mg/mL) compared to higher IC 50 values with enoxaparin. <b>Sulodexide</b> and enoxaparin exhibited a similar effect on heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody-mediated platelet activation HIPA assays. These results suggest that <b>sulodexide</b> is a relatively stronger anticoagulant agent than enoxaparin. <b>Sulodexide</b> is subcutaneously absorbed. Its ability to inhibit TF-mediated platelet activation may contribute to the observed therapeutic effects of <b>sulodexide</b> in microvascular vasculopathy such as diabetic nephropathy. These results also sug-gest that inhibition of TF activation of platelets by sulo-dexide may be independent of its anticoagulant effects.

In the current study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of <b>Sulodexide</b> on CIN and investigated the potential mechanisms. Methods: CIN model was induced by intravenous injection of indomethacin, followed by Ioversol and L-NAME. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: control group, CIN group, CIN+vehicle group (CIN rats pretreated with vehicle) and CIN+ <b>Sulodexide</b> (CIN rats pretreated with <b>Sulodexide).</b> <b>Sulodexide</b> or an equivalent volume of vehicle was intravenously delivered 30 min before the induction of CIN. All the animals were sacrificed at 24 h after CIN and tissues were harvested to evaluate renal injury, kidney oxidative stress and apoptosis levels. Plasma antithrombin III (ATIII) activities were also measured. Results: Compared to the untreated CIN group, improved renal function, reduced tubular injury, decreased levels of oxidative stress and apoptosis were observed in CIN rats receiving <b>Sulodexide</b> injection.

Clinical {{studies have demonstrated}} that <b>sulodexide</b> is capable of reducing urinary albumin excretion rates in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, suggesting that <b>sulodexide</b> has renal protection. However, this efficacy remains inconclusive. In this article, we used meta-analysis to summarize the clinical results of all prospective clinical studies {{in order to determine the}} clinical efficacy and safety of <b>sulodexide</b> in diabetic patients with nephropathy. Overall, <b>sulodexide</b> therapy was associated with a significant reduction in urinary protein excretion. In the <b>sulodexide</b> group, 220 (17. 7 %) achieved at least a 50 % decrease in albumin excretion rate compared with only 141 (11. 5 %) in the placebo. The odds ratio comparing proportions of patients with therapeutic success between the <b>sulodexide</b> and placebo groups was 3. 28 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 34 – 8. 06; P= 0. 01). These data suggest a renoprotective benefit of <b>sulodexide</b> in patients with diabetes and micro- and macroalbuminuria, which will provide important information for clinical use of this drug as a potential modality for diabetic nephropathy, specifically, the prevention of end-stage renal disease that is often caused by diabetes.

40|$|Aim. To study <b>sulodexide</b> {{clinical}} efficacy {{in patients}} with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) in prevention of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). Material and мethods. Patients with type 2 DM and IHD who undergone X-Ray contrast intervention. The patients were randomized into 2 groups: 56 patients of the main group were i/v administered <b>sulodexide</b> (Vessel Due F, “Alfa Wassermann”, Italy) according to standard procedure; 56 patients of the control group were treated with unfractionated heparin. Results. The incidence of CIN in the main and control groups was, respectively, 16 % and 42 % (p< 0. 01). Reduction of microalbuminuria (MAU) was found in 89. 3 % of the <b>sulodexide</b> group patients. MAU dynamics in patients of control group was not observed. There were no deteriorations in echocardiography characteristics in patients of both groups. The reduction in  low density cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels was observed in the main group. <b>Sulodexide</b> induced a lengthening of the {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (from 30 ± 0. 6 to 34 ± 0. 5 s), without altering fibrinogen level. There were no thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications of endovascular intervention in <b>sulodexide</b> group. No one case of thrombocytopenia was observed. Higher risk of CIN {{in patients with}}out <b>sulodexide</b> treatment compared with this in <b>sulodexide</b> treated patients was associated with multiple lesions of coronary arteries, diuretic intake in periprocedural period, contrast agent dose, duration of hospitalization, seriousness of intervention.

40|$|Background. Peritoneal {{dialysis}} (PD) {{is associated}} with functional and morphological alterations of the peritoneal membrane (PM). It is hypothesized that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{plays a role in}} this process. <b>Sulodexide</b> is a glycosaminoglycan with effects on vascular biology. Therefore, the impact of oral <b>sulodexide</b> on PM function and morphology in a rat model of peritoneal perfusion was evaluated. Methods. Rats received 10 mL peritoneal dialysate fluid (PDF) twice daily via a tunnelled PD catheter. The test-PD group (Sul) received 15 mg/kg/day oral <b>sulodexide</b> versus none in the control–PD group (Con). A third group received no PDF (Sham). After 12 weeks, a peritoneal equilibration test was performed and the PM was sampled. Neo-angiogenesis was evaluated using immunostaining with von Willebrand, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) using co-localization of cytokeratin and α-smooth muscle actin. VEGF was determined in the dialysate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. PD induced loss of ultrafiltration, also in the <b>sulodexide</b> group. Creatinine and glucose transport were better preserved, and sodium dip was more pronounced in the <b>sulodexide</b> group versus control. Submesothelial thickness, neo-angiogenesis and EMT were more pronounced in the Con versus Sul versus Sham group. VEGF in the dialysate, corrected for diffusion was higher in Con and Sul versus Sham. Conclusion. Oral <b>sulodexide</b> administration diminishes neo-vascularization, submesothelial thickening and EMT induced by exposure to PDF in a rat model.

In arterial pathology, changes in the Winsor Index, improvement in peripheral blood flow, and reduction in pain-free walking distance confirm that treatment with oral <b>sulodexide</b> is effective. Lipid components linked to the genesis of peripheral vascular processes, including triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein fractions, as well as plasma and blood viscosity, are reduced by the administration of <b>sulodexide,</b> whereas the high-density lipoprotein fraction increases. <b>Sulodexide</b> inhibits aggregation and adhesion of platelets {{at the level of}} the vascular wall, reduces plasma fibrinogen concentrations, reduces plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, and increases tissue plasminogen activator, as well as systemic fibrinolytic and thrombolytic activity, thereby demonstrating efficacy in the treatment of thromboembolic disease. There is no interaction between <b>sulodexide</b> and other drugs used as long-term treatment for peripheral vascular disease.

40|$|Background. Urinary albumin {{excretion}} frequently {{persists in}} diabetic {{patients who are}} treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). <b>Sulodexide,</b> a glycosaminoglycan mixture of 80 % heparan sulfate and 20 % dermatan sulfate, has been hypothesized to reduce persistent albuminuria. We have conducted a multi-center randomized double-blind pilot study {{in order to determine}} the effect of 6 months' therapy with <b>sulodexide</b> on urinary albumin excretion and to address logistical issues for a full-scale trial. Methods. A total of 149 patients with type 2 diabetes and an albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) between 20 and 300 mg/g were randomized with equal allocation to either placebo, 200 mg of <b>sulodexide</b> or 400 mg of <b>sulodexide.</b> The primary endpoint was the achievement, at 6 months, of either 3 (1) return to normoalbuminuria (ACR < 20 mg/g with a decrease of at least 25 %) or (2) a decrease in ACR of at least 50 % from the baseline value. All patients used a maximum tolerated recommended FDA approved dose of an ACEI or ARB for at least 60 days and had stable blood pressure prior to randomization. Results. The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in 25. 3 % of the patients in the two <b>sulodexide</b> groups combined versus 15. 4 % of the placebo-treated patients (P = 0. 26).

40|$|AimsIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>sulodexide</b> is able to lower blood pressure (BP). This may be attributed to its ability to restore the endothelial surface layer (ESL). As ESL perturbation is known {{to be related to the}} degree of kidney damage, we investigated whether albuminuria, reflecting ESL status, modified the BP-lowering potential of <b>sulodexide.</b> MethodsA post hoc analysis of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled <b>sulodexide</b> microalbuminuria (Sun-MICRO) and macroalbuminuria (Sun-MACRO) studies, including 1056 microalbuminuric and 843 macroalbuminuric subjects with type 2 diabetes receiving maximal tolerated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor therapy, was carried out. We compared the effect of placebo and <b>sulodexide</b> on systolic BP (SBP) among albuminuria groups. ResultsAnalysis of covariance, including data from both trials, showed that baseline urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) was the only modifier of the SBP response (interaction with treatment P= 0. 001).

40|$|AIMS <b>Sulodexide</b> is {{a highly}} {{purified}} mixture of glycosaminoglycans that has been studied for its anti-albuminuric potential. Considering the effects of glycosaminoglycans on endothelial function and sodium homeostasis, we hypothesized that <b>sulodexide</b> may lower blood pressure (BP). In this meta-analysis, we therefore investigated the antihypertensive effects of <b>sulodexide</b> treatment. METHODS We selected randomized controlled trials that investigated <b>sulodexide</b> treatment of at least 4 weeks and measured BP at baseline and after treatment. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, population characteristics and outcome measures. In addition, we contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to provide missing data. RESULTS Eight studies, totalling 3019 subjects (mean follow-up 4. 4 months) were included. Mean age was 61 years and mean baseline BP was 135 / 75 mmHg. Compared with control treatment, <b>sulodexide</b> resulted in a significant systolic (2. 2 mmHg [95 % CI 0. 3, 4. 1], P = 0. 02) and diastolic BP reduction (1. 7 mmHg [95 % CI 0. 6, 2. 9], P = 0. 004). Hypertensive patients displayed the largest systolic BP and diastolic BP reductions (10. 2 / 5. 4 mmHg, P < 0. 001). Higher baseline systolic and diastolic BP {{were significantly associated with}} larger systolic (r(2) = 0. 83, P < 0. 001) and diastolic BP (r(2) = 0. 41, P = 0. 02) reductions after <b>sulodexide</b> treatment. In addition, systolic (r(2) = 0. 41, P = 0. 03) and diastolic BP reductions (r(2) = 0. 60, P = 0. 005) were significantly associated with albuminuria reduction.

40|$|Abstract Background Epithelial-mesenchymal {{transition}} of tubular cells {{is a widely}} recognized mechanism that sustains interstitial fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy (DN). The signaling of FGF- 2, a growth factor involved in this mechanism, is regulated by glycosaminoglycans. Heparanase- 1, an endoglycosidase that cleaves heparan sulfate, is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and is necessary to FGF- 2 for the induction of tubular cells transition. Well known Heparanase- 1 inhibitors are heparin(s) and <b>sulodexide,</b> a low-molecular weight heparin – dermatan sulphate blend, which is effective {{in the treatment of}} DN. Methods We have investigated the inhibition by <b>sulodexide</b> and its components of Heparanase- 1 by an ELISA assay. We have analyzed its effect on the epithelial-mesenchymal {{transition of}} tubular cells by real time gene expression analysis, zymography and migration assay. Results Results show that <b>sulodexide</b> is an effective heparanase- 1 inhibitor, exclusively in virtue to the heparin component, with an IC 50 of 5 μg/ml. In FGF- 2 treated tubular cells, <b>sulodexide</b> also prevents the over-expression of the mesenchymal markers αSMA, vimentin and fibronectin and the motility increase, i. e. the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of tubular cells. Moreover, <b>sulodexide</b> prevents FGF- 2 induced heparanase- 1 and MMP 9 increase switching off the autocrine loop that FGF- 2 activates to support its signal. Conclusions The findings highlight the capacity of <b>sulodexide</b> to inhibit heparanase- 1 and to control tubular fibrosis triggered by epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, these <b>sulodexide</b> activities support the value of this agent in controlling the progression of nephropathy to renal failure. </p...|$|E

This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the efficacy of <b>sulodexide,</b> a glycosaminoglycan compound with antithrombotic properties, in preventing death and thromboembotic events after acute myocardial infarction. Background. Antithrombotic therapy has been found {{to play an important role}} in the prevention of cardiovascular events and death after acute myocardial infarction. Glycosaminoglycan-containing compounds, including <b>sulodexide,</b> show profibrinolytic and antithrombotic properties that render them suitable for use in patients after infarction. Methods. A total of 3, 986 patients who had recovered from acute myocardial infarction were randomized to receive either the standard therapy routinely administered at each study center, excluding antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs (control group, 1, 970 patients), or the standard therapy plus <b>sulodexide</b> (treated group, 2, 016 patients). Between 7 and 10 days after the episode of acute myocardial infarction, <b>sulodexide</b> was administered as a single daily 600 -lipoprotein-lipase-releasing unit (LRU) intramuscular injection for the 1 st month, followed by oral capsules of 500 LRU twice daily. Patients were evaluated for ≥ 12 months. Results. At the end of the study, 140 (7. 1 %) were recorded in the control group and 97 (4. 8 %) in the <b>sulodexide</b> group (32 % risk reduction, p = 0. 0022, chi-square test). A total of 90 patients (4. 6 %) in the control group had a further infarction, compared with 66 (33 %) in the <b>sulodexide</b> group (28 % risk reduction, p = 0. 035). Furthermore, a reduction in left ventricular thrombus formation (evaluated by echocardiography) was observed in the sulodeside group (n = 12; 0. 6 %), compared with values in the control group (n = 25; 1. 3 %) (53 % risk reduction, p = 0. 027). <b>Sulodexide</b> was well tolerated and devoid of significant adverse events. All significant results were confirmed by "actual treatment" analyses. Conclusions. The study provides evidence that long-term therapy with <b>sulodexide</b> started early after an episode of acute myocardial infarction is associated with reductions in total mortality, rate of reinfarction and mural thrombus formation. © 1994...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Sulodexide,</b> a {{heterogenous}} {{group of}} sulfated glycosaminoglycans, includes low-molecular-weight heparin (similar to 80 % +/- 8 %), high-molecular-weight heparin (similar to 5 % +/- 3 %), and dermatan (similar to 20 % +/- 8 %), {{with a mean}} molecular weight of similar to 9 kDa. The drug is absorbed orally and has no anticoagulant effect in the doses used. Small preliminary studies consistently showed <b>sulodexide</b> {{to be associated with}} decreased albuminuria in patients with diabetes. Study Design: We conducted a multicenter placebo-controlled double-blinded study to determine the effect of <b>sulodexide</b> on urine albumin excretion in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Setting & Participants: Patients with type 2 diabetes and urine albumin-creatinine ratios (ACRs) of 35 - 200 mg/g in men and 45 - 200 mg/g in women were enrolled. Serum creatinine level was Intervention: The study drug was <b>sulodexide,</b> 200 mg/d. Outcome & Measurements: The primary end point was normoalbuminuria (ACR 25 %) or 50 % decrease in baseline ACR. Results: In 1, 056 randomly assigned patients with a mean baseline ACR of 107. 8 +/- 83. 7 mg/g, comparing the <b>sulodexide</b> versus placebo groups, the primary end point was achieved in 16. 5 % versus 18. 4 %; normoalbuminuria, in 7. 9 % versus 6. 1 %; and a 50 % decrease in albuminuria, in 15. 4 % versus 17. 6 %. The relative probability of any given change in albuminuria was identical in both groups. Limitations: We were unable to determine whether the administered <b>sulodexide</b> was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Conclusion: <b>Sulodexide</b> failed to decrease urine albumin excretion in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy and microalbuminuria. Am J Kidney Dis. 58 (5) : 729 - 736.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>sulodexide</b> is able to lower blood pressure (BP). This may be attributed to its ability to restore the endothelial surface layer (ESL). As ESL perturbation is known {{to be related to the}} degree of kidney damage, we investigated whether albuminuria, reflecting ESL status, modified the BP-lowering potential of <b>sulodexide.</b> A post hoc analysis of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled <b>sulodexide</b> microalbuminuria (Sun-MICRO) and macroalbuminuria (Sun-MACRO) studies, including 1056 microalbuminuric and 843 macroalbuminuric subjects with type 2 diabetes receiving maximal tolerated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor therapy, was carried out. We compared the effect of placebo and <b>sulodexide</b> on systolic BP (SBP) among albuminuria groups. Analysis of covariance, including data from both trials, showed that baseline urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) was the only modifier of the SBP response (interaction with treatment P = 0. 001). In subjects with an UACR > 1000 mg g(- 1), <b>sulodexide</b> lowered SBP by 4. 6 mmHg [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 6, 5. 6; P < 0. 001] compared with placebo, whereas a 2. 3 mmHg (95 % CI 0. 9, 3. 7; P = 0. 001) reduction was seen in subjects with a UACR of 300 - 1000 mg g(- 1). <b>Sulodexide</b> did not lower SBP in subjects with a UACR < 300 mg g(- 1) (- 0. 2 mmHg, 95 % CI - 0. 8, 0. 5; P = 0. 60). SBP-lowering effects were not accompanied by changes in body weight. The BP-reducing potency of <b>sulodexide</b> is modified by the degree of albuminuria in subjects with type 2 diabetes. As ESL status deteriorates with increasing albuminuria and nephropathy severity, this suggests that ESL restoration may represent a new target for BP treatment in subjects with diabetic nephropath...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sulodexide</b> is {{a highly}} {{purified}} mixture of glycosaminoglycans that has been studied for its anti-albuminuric potential. Considering the effects of glycosaminoglycans on endothelial function and sodium homeostasis, we hypothesized that <b>sulodexide</b> may lower blood pressure (BP). In this meta-analysis, we therefore investigated the antihypertensive effects of <b>sulodexide</b> treatment. We selected randomized controlled trials that investigated <b>sulodexide</b> treatment of at least 4 weeks and measured BP at baseline and after treatment. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, population characteristics and outcome measures. In addition, we contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to provide missing data. Eight studies, totalling 3019 subjects (mean follow-up 4. 4 months) were included. Mean age was 61 years and mean baseline BP was 135 / 75 mmHg. Compared with control treatment, <b>sulodexide</b> resulted in a significant systolic (2. 2 mmHg [95 % CI 0. 3, 4. 1], P = 0. 02) and diastolic BP reduction (1. 7 mmHg [95 % CI 0. 6, 2. 9], P = 0. 004). Hypertensive patients displayed the largest systolic BP and diastolic BP reductions (10. 2 / 5. 4 mmHg, P < 0. 001). Higher baseline systolic and diastolic BP {{were significantly associated with}} larger systolic (r(2) = 0. 83, P < 0. 001) and diastolic BP (r(2) = 0. 41, P = 0. 02) reductions after <b>sulodexide</b> treatment. In addition, systolic (r(2) = 0. 41, P = 0. 03) and diastolic BP reductions (r(2) = 0. 60, P = 0. 005) were significantly associated with albuminuria reduction. Our data suggest that <b>sulodexide</b> treatment results in a significant BP reduction, especially in hypertensive subjects. This indicates that endothelial glycosaminoglycans might be an independent therapy target in cardiovascular disease. Future studies should further address the BP lowering potential of sulodexid...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To study {{effect of}} <b>sulodexide</b> (Vessel Due F) on the {{functional}} state of endothelium {{in patients with}} diabetic retinopathy. Materials and methods. A total of 37 patients with DR were divided in 2 groups and treated with <b>sulodexide.</b> Group 1 comprised 16 patients with non-proliferative DR, group 2 included 21 patients with preproliferative DR. The functional state of endothelium was estimated from the plasma and serum levels of endothelial factors (sVCAM, endothelin, nitric oxide, t-PA, Willebrand factor). Results. The measurement of the initial levels of endothelial factors in both groups revealed significant changes in endothelin, nitric oxide, and sVCAM suggesting disturbances of endothelial function due to DR. <b>Sulodexide</b> therapy normalized it regardless of DR stage and thereby improved functional activity of retina.

This study has demonstrated beneficial effect of <b>sulodexide</b> on endothelial function in patients with DR due to correction of the production of vasoactive factors (endothelin, nitric oxide) and stimulation of fibrinolytic activity of the vascular wall (t-PA) ...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} clinical {{efficiency of}} <b>sulodexide</b> (glycosoaminoglycan) {{for the treatment}} of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) at the stage of microalbuminuria (MAU). Materials and methods. A total of 30 patients with DM 2 and MAU were examined 15 of whom were given <b>sulodexide</b> (200 mg daily) for 6 months. The following parameters were measured before, 3 and 6 months after the onset of therapy: HbA 1 c level, biochemical characteristics, highly sensitive CRB, MAU in morning urine samples, soluble intercellular and vascular cell adhesion molecules- 1, blood coagulation and anticoagulation factors (PTI, fibrinogen, thrombin time, coagulation factors VII, VIII, X, Willebrand factor), tissue plasminogen activator, and its inhibitor. Results. <b>Sulodexide</b> produced significant positive effect on albumin excretion in urine. It exerted antithromotic and profibrinolytic action and improved endothelial function. Taken together, these properties of <b>sulodexide</b> give reason to recommend it as a protector of different vascular segments. Conclusion. Significant positive effect of <b>sulodexide</b> on albumin excretion in urine coupled to its multifactor activity, convenience of therapeutic application, low risk of complications, good tolerability, and safety in aged patients with DM 2 permit to consider it as a promising tool {{for the treatment of}} DM 2 with MAU...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the anti-proteinuric effect of <b>sulodexide</b> in rats with adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy. A total of 40 healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups: normal control group (Control-group), ADR control group (ADR-group), <b>sulodexide</b> treatment group (SUL-group), and losartan treatment group (LOS-group). The ADR-induced rat models were established by injecting two different doses of ADR (4 and 3. 5 mg/kg) into the caudal vein of rat for two consecutive weeks. After that, SUL-group and LOS-group were respectively treated with <b>sulodexide</b> (10 mg/kg/day) and losartan (10 mg/kg/day) for an additional 4 weeks period. Samples of 24 -hour urine were harvested at 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks after the model establishment. The pathological change in renal tissues was observed by light microscopy, the function of liver and kidney were assayed at week 6 th. The results showed that the urinary excretion of protein progressively increased in ADR-group, and accompanied with severe nephrotic syndrome such as massive albuminuria, proteinuria, and hyperlipidemia. <b>Sulodexide</b> effectively reduced the 24 -hour urinary protein excretion of ADR-induced nephropathy rats, preventing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

40|$|<b>Sulodexide</b> is {{a highly}} {{purified}} glycosaminoglycan approved for leg ulcers treatment. It contains two principal components: heparan sulfate, a fast-moving heparin fraction, (80 %) and dermatan sulfate (20 %). <b>Sulodexide</b> is available as an oral agent and as an injectable preparation. Its pharmacological action is obtained by dose-dependent coagulation factors inhibition: dermatan sulfate upgrades the physiological action of a selective thrombin inhibitor, heparin cofactor II, and heparan sulfate depresses activated factor X, via an increase of antithrombin III action. The antithrombotic action is enhanced by platelet aggregation inhibition and by the activation of the fibrinolytic system. This paper summarizes the results {{of some of the}} main trials that evaluated <b>sulodexide</b> in the treatment of peripheral occlusive arterial disease and venous leg ulcers; a trial on prevention of recurrent deep venous thrombosis with <b>sulodexide</b> is also reviewed. We analyzed data about the clinical and economical impact of chronic venous insufficiency with a particular attention to the cost of medication, hospitalization and management of leg ulcers. The hypothetical savings correlated to the reduction of leg ulcers incidence and healing time attainable with <b>sulodexide</b> have been estimated. A comparison between the different acquisition costs of the drugs frequently used to treat leg ulcers is also provided.
