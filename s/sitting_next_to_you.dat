500|$|Form and Fuller {{recognized}} the iconic {{status of the}} music used {{in the first four}} Friday the 13th films. For their 2009 film, they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music, which was composed and originally performed by Harry Manfredini. They did not plan to use the score in its entirety, but they used Steve Jablonsky to compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film. Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score Friday the 13th after having worked with him on the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Nispel told Jablonsky [...] he wanted him to create something that Nispel could [...] "whistle when [...] left the theater", but was subtle enough that it would not immediately register while watching the film. Nispel said, [...] "I don't believe that, when you watch a Friday the 13th film, you want to feel like John Williams is <b>sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> with the London Symphony Orchestra".|$|E

If I could have got into Browndown that night, I should have liked to have done to him what a Mexican maid of mine (at the Central American period of my career) did to her drunken husband--who was a kind of peddler, dealing in whips and sticks.

5000|$|Song Fight! is {{a weekly}} online songwriting and {{recording}} competition in which amateur artists are openly invited to participate. Traditionally, a title and deadline are posted each week for which participants write, record, and submit {{a song in}} MP3 format. All entries are compiled {{at the end of}} the week and links to the files are displayed on the front page for public voting, which lasts until the end of the next week. All visitors to the site are able to listen to the MP3s and are permitted one vote each. At the end of this voting period, results are posted and the next cycle (or [...] "fight") begins, meaning at any given time one fight is in the works (in that a deadline and title are available) while the previous fight is in its voting stage. While the original Song Fight! system involved only one fight per week, as many as four are now sometimes conducted. Winning earns you no more or less than [...] "bragging rights, satisfaction, and the jealous glances of strangers <b>sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> on the subway." [...] Nonetheless, the site has inspired well over a thousand artists to enter since the competition's inception.|$|E

5000|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and wrote, [...] "Films like Speed belong to the genre I call Bruised Forearm Movies, because you're always {{grabbing}} {{the arm of the}} person <b>sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Done wrong, they seem like tired replays of old chase cliches. Done well, they're fun. Done as well as Speed, they generate a kind of manic exhilaration". In his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Peter Travers wrote, [...] "Action flicks are usually written off as a debased genre, unless, of course, they work. And Speed works like a charm. It's a reminder of how much movie escapism can still stir us when it's dished out with this kind of dazzle". Hal Hinson, in his review for The Washington Post, praised Sandra Bullock's performance: [...] "The only performer to stand out is Sandra Bullock as Annie ... If it weren't for the smart-funny twist she gives to her lines—they're the best in the film—the air on that bus would have been stifling ... she emerges as a slightly softer version of the Linda Hamilton-Sigourney Weaver heroines: capable, independent, but still irresistibly vulnerable". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Mr. Hopper finds nice new ways to convey crazy menace with each new role. Certainly he's the most colorful figure in a film that wastes no time on character development or personality". Entertainment Weekly gave the film an [...] "A" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "It's a pleasure to {{be in the hands of}} an action filmmaker who respects the audience. De Bont's craftsmanship is so supple that even the triple ending feels justified, like the cataclysmic final stage of a Sega death match". Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "The movie has two virtues essential to good pop thrillers. First, it plugs uncomplicatedly into lurking anxieties—in this case the ones we brush aside when we daily surrender ourselves to mass transit in a world where the loonies are everywhere". Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino (who was also commissioned to direct the film, but declined) named the film one of the twenty best films he had seen since 1992.|$|E
