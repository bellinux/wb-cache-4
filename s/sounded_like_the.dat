25|$|Although the Armenians {{were known}} to history much earlier (for example, they were {{mentioned}} in the 6th century BC Behistun Inscription and in Xenophon's 4th century BC history, The Anabasis), the oldest surviving Armenian-language text is the 5th century AD Bible translation of Mesrop Mashtots, who created the Armenian alphabet in 405 AD, at which time it had 36 letters. He is also credited by some {{with the creation of}} the Caucasian Albanian alphabet. In The Anabasis, Xenophon describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC. He relates that the Armenian people spoke a language that to his ear <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> language of the Persians.|$|E
500|$|Sibelius's publishers, Breitkopf & Härtel, thought The Bard <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> first {{movement}} of a suite {{rather than a}} stand-alone concert piece. Sibelius vacillated back and forth, at first agreeing to recast the piece as a [...] "fantasy in two parts, or an Intrada and Allegro", {{and then as a}} triptych in June 1913, before deciding sometime around July or August that The Bard should remain as an independent composition.|$|E
500|$|When Jackson {{began the}} Off the Wall project {{he was not}} sure what he wanted as the final result; however, he did not want another record that <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>The</b> Jacksons, but rather he wanted more {{creative}} freedom, something he had not been allowed on prior albums. Jackson's father Joseph also approved of the project and allowed him to record it on the condition that it didn't interfere with group business. Despite his brothers' desire to work with him, Jackson wanted to make the album independently of his family. Nevertheless, his brother Randy still contributed percussion to [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough".|$|E

500|$|Vonnegut was {{an admirer}} of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, {{particularly}} the Beatitudes, and incorporated it into his own doctrines. He also referred to it in many of his works. In his 1991 book Fates Worse than Death, Vonnegut suggests that during the Reagan administration, [...] "anything that <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Sermon on the Mount was socialistic or communistic, and therefore anti-American". In Palm Sunday, he wrote that [...] "the Sermon on the Mount suggests a mercifulness that can never waver or fade." [...] However, Vonnegut had a deep dislike for certain aspects of Christianity, often reminding his readers of the bloody history of the Crusades and other religion-inspired violence. He despised the televangelists of the late 20th century, feeling that their thinking was narrow-minded.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{soundtrack of}} Pokiri was composed by Mani Sharma, with lyrics written by Bhakarabhatla, Kandikonda and Viswa. Jagannadh wanted Sharma to compose six songs, with two duets between the lead pair, three solo numbers by the male lead, and an item number. During the shoot of Sivamani (2003), Jagannadh {{listened to the}} song [...] "Listen to the Falling Rain" [...] which <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> song [...] "Gala Gala Parutunna Godarila" [...] from the Telugu film Gowri (1974). He later came {{to learn that the}} latter song was inspired by the former, and he decided to reuse the same tune with modernised instruments and different lyrics. Sharma was accused of copying the tune of the song [...] "Jaleo" [...] composed by Ricky Martin for the song [...] "Devuda" [...] sung by Naveen.|$|E
500|$|Neha Mujumdar of The Hindu was {{extremely}} {{disappointed with the}} track, calling it [...] "musically generic" [...] and [...] "lyrically filled with platitudes". She gave a negative review of the production, and panned Chopra's [...] "auto-tuned" [...] vocals. Mujumdar wrote that will.I.am's rapping [...] "does little to relieve the monotony; indeed, it manages to increase it, because of how predictable his exhortations are", and that apart fulfilling a desire for [...] "the sort of over-produced music that typically fills up a fast-food chain store", the song is indistinguishable [...] "from the large body of repetitive, unoriginal dance-pop". Writing for the US online news portal GlobalPost, Jason Overdorf {{did not agree with}} early reviews that said [...] "In My City" [...] <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> music of The Black Eyed Peas.|$|E

500|$|By late1964, the Who were {{becoming}} popular in London's Marquee club, and a rave review of their live act appeared in Melody Maker. Lambert and Stamp {{attracted the attention}} of the American producer Shel Talmy, who had produced the Kinks. Townshend had written a song, [...] "I Can't Explain", that deliberately <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Kinks to attract Talmy's attention. Talmy saw the group in rehearsals and was impressed. He signed them to his production company, and sold the recording to the US arm of Decca Records, which meant that the group's early singles were released in Britain on Brunswick Records, one of UK Decca's labels for US artists. [...] "I Can't Explain" [...] was recorded in early November 1964 at Pye Studios in Marble Arch with the Ivy League on backing vocals, and Jimmy Page played fuzz guitar on the B-side, [...] "Bald Headed Woman".|$|E
500|$|On October 2, detectives put Bundy in {{a lineup}} before DaRonch, who {{immediately}} {{identified him as}} [...] "Officer Roseland". Witnesses from Bountiful picked him from the same lineup as the stranger lurking about the high school auditorium. There was insufficient evidence linking him to Debra Kent (whose body was never found), but {{more than enough to}} charge him with aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault in the DaRonch case. He was freed on $15,000 bail, paid by his parents, and spent most of the time between indictment and trial in Seattle, living in Kloepfer's house. Seattle police had insufficient evidence to charge him in the Pacific Northwest murders, but kept him under close surveillance. [...] "When Ted and I stepped out on the porch to go somewhere," [...] Kloepfer wrote, [...] "so many unmarked police cars started up that it <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the Indy 500." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoppus {{considered}} {{the music on}} the album wide-ranging, commenting, [...] "We tried to capture the energy and not worry so much about all the knobs." [...] This includes songs he felt <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> group circa 1999, [...] "super-fast late-Nineties-punk-rock-sounding songs," [...] {{as well as more}} progressive songs [...] "that are like nothing we have ever done before." [...] Overall, he {{considered the}} record [...] "really rich with sing-along melodies and sing-along choruses," [...] which was what he preferred most when listening to bands. Feldmann considered the music not a [...] "huge departure" [...] from the band's usual sound, as hoped to make a [...] "classic Blink record." [...] To familiarize himself, he listened to all of the band's catalogue prior to recording. Lisa Worden, music director at Los Angeles radio station KROQ, compared its sound to the second Blink-182 album, Dude Ranch, and commented, [...] "It sounds like Blink but it's not anything that we've heard before. For fans of the band, they're going to be super happy with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the album's track {{order not}} being decided {{until the very}} end, Yamaguchi had thought {{from the start that}} [...] "Ame wa Kimagure", [...] "Malaysia 32" [...] and [...] "Uneri" [...] should be in that order. After plans for [...] "Ame wa Kimagure" [...] to become the leading song were scrapped, Yamaguchi decided to {{elaborate}} on the [...] "oriental" [...] feel of the song. [...] "Malaysia 32" [...] is the band's first instrumental song, and was based on a synthesizer riff made by the band's guitarist Motoharu Iwadera which was then completed with ideas from everyone in the band. The song was called [...] "Malaysia" [...] because of how at one point they added a vocal melody that <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> name of the city Kuala Lumpur. The number 32 in the title is a reference {{to the fact that the}} song is based on a synthesizer loop of 32 bars. Originally [...] "Uneri" [...] had been envisioned as a rock song, but the band decided against this after creating [...] "Night Fishing Is Good". The band's musical director suggested that they perform the song acoustically instead, which led to the final studio arrangement of [...] "Uneri".|$|E
500|$|Part of the album's {{innovation}} was the singer's further {{embrace of}} electronic instrumentation, an interest established in Debut, which featured mechanical dance numbers such as [...] "Violently Happy" [...] and [...] "Big Time Sensuality". Treblezine.com {{has said that}} Post [...] "melded alternative dance and electronic with a graceful flow". While IDM and trip hop influences were present in Debut, Post is characterised by the singer's fuller incorporation of these genres. According to i-D, Post [...] "couldn't have existed without Aphex Twin, Black Dog, A Guy Called Gerald, LFO {{and all the other}} producers who reshaped the language of music since 1988". In an article celebrating the 20th anniversary of its release, Stereogum stated that the album [...] "had enough Debut-era dance-pop in it that it still <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> work of the same person," [...] but also [...] "blew Björk's previously-established sound out into something way, way bigger and more impressive". Mark Pytlik considered that, in a time when electronic music was still considered [...] "cold, austere, or inhuman", it was unorthodox for Björk to [...] "be playing with electronic elements—the stuff of science-fiction soundtracks, Kraftwerkian teutonics, and Orbital-style blippiness—and using them to express a closeness to nature." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of Enough wanted Lopez {{to write a}} new song for the film. According to Lopez, writing a song is something that cannot be forced; [...] "It kinda just has to happen". While on their honeymoon in October 2001, Cris Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful" [...] {{and that it would}} make a [...] "wonderful song". Lopez felt that a [...] "little bit of it <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> movie, a little haunting". When she heard the melody, Lopez said to herself: [...] "I can write something to that right now. And we can use it in Enough". She then began to think about the film and the character that she portrays and what she had been through. In addition, she also thought about the things that she had gone through in her own life. According to Lopez, it was easy to be inspired by the melody Judd had written, [...] "and just kind of that grateful feeling, to just be here [...] And keeping it simple. Because life can get so crazy and everything. And then you realize, it's all just kinda about the simplicity of being here, and being healthy. And being alive. So that's where the song came from." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1966, Wilson {{said that}} the highest note he could sing was D5. Starting with the 1970 {{sessions}} for the Surf's Up album, engineer Stephen Desper remembers the emerging corrosive effects of Wilson's incessant chain smoking and cocaine use: [...] "He could still do falsettos and stuff, but he'd need Carl to help him. Either that or I'd modify the tape speed-wise to make it artificially higher, so it <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> old days." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Suitcase" [...] is {{the eighth}} {{song on the}} album. She was singing the line [...] "he's got a blue face" [...] and Sandé thought it <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "suitcase". Then at that moment, a whole story came out, and said at that moment {{she was trying to}} express how she was feeling, subconsciously almost.

It was a deception by the separatist wing of the Popular Democrat Party. In English translation, those who voted for this actually voted for Sovereign Free Association, [...] a form of Independence.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music of}} ancient Greece was almost universally present in ancient Greek society, from marriages, funerals, and {{religious}} ceremonies to theatre, folk music, and the ballad-like reciting of epic poetry. It thus played an integral {{role in the}} lives of ancient Greeks. There are significant fragments of actual Greek musical notation as well as many literary references to ancient Greek music, such that some things can be known—or reasonably surmised—about what the music <b>sounded</b> <b>like,</b> <b>the</b> general role of music in society, the economics of music, the importance of a professional caste of musicians, etc. Even archaeological remains reveal an abundance of depictions on ceramics, for example, of music being performed.|$|E
