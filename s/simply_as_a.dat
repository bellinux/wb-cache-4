5|$|A {{video game}} {{walkthrough}} is a guide aimed towards improving a player's skill {{within a particular}} video game and often designed to assist players in completing either an entire video game or specific elements. Walkthroughs may alternatively be set up as a playthrough, where players record themselves playing through a game and upload or live-stream it to the internet. Walkthroughs may be considered guides on helping to enhance the experience of players, to assist towards unlocking game achievements or <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means to socialise with like-minded individuals as a distraction from everyday life.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in France, Day {{regularly}} corresponded with Edgeworth. He said that both girls were passionate about their studies, Sabrina more so. Day also related anecdotes, one concerning a {{trip on the}} Rhone where the boat overturned and he rescued both girls single-handedly as neither could swim. He described an incident in which he challenged a French Army officer to a duel, even producing a set of dueling pistols, <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> manner of engaging or encouraging conversation with his young students; the officer apologised and explained he did not mean any offence, calming the situation.|$|E
5|$|The common cold, {{also known}} <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cold, is a viral {{infectious}} {{disease of the}} upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure. They include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days. Some symptoms may last up to three weeks. In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.|$|E

5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule {{has generally been}} chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier. The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; {{that is why it}} is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, he {{reported}} preliminary cytological {{studies on the}} Aspleniums and suggested that A.montanum had crossed with ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron) to yield Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi), noting that D. C. Eaton and W. N. Clute had already made tentative suggestions along those lines. He also made chromosome counts of A.×trudellii, which had been classified by some <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> variety of A.pinnatifidum. As A.pinnatifidum {{proved to be a}} tetraploid while A.montanum was a diploid, a hybrid between them would be a triploid, and Wagner showed that this was in fact the case for A.×trudellii. His further experiments, published the following year, strongly suggested that both A.bradleyi and A.pinnatifidum were allotetraploids, the product of hybridization between A.montanum and another Asplenium to form a sterile diploid, followed by chromosome doubling that restored fertility.|$|E
5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description of the ritual.|$|E

5|$|Since its publication, {{some have}} viewed {{the book with}} skepticism. Some in the Middle Ages {{regarded}} the book <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> romance or fable, due largely to the sharp difference of its descriptions of a sophisticated civilisation in China to other early accounts by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and William of Rubruck who portrayed the Mongols as 'barbarians' who appeared to belong to 'some other world'. Doubts have also been raised in later centuries about Marco Polo's narrative of his travels in China, for example for his failure to mention the Great Wall of China, {{and in particular the}} difficulties in identifying many of the place names he used (the great majority however have since been identified). Many have questioned if he had visited the places he mentioned in his itinerary, if he had appropriated the accounts of his father and uncle or other travelers, and some doubted if he even reached China, or that if he did, perhaps never went beyond Khanbaliq (Beijing).|$|E
5|$|The mantle is a vestment or robe worn {{by members}} since the 15th century. Once made of wool, by the 16th century {{it was made}} of velvet. The mantle was {{originally}} purple, but varied during the 17th and 18th centuries between celestial blue, pale blue, royal blue, dark blue, violet, and ultramarine. Mantles are now dark blue and lined with white taffeta. The mantles of the Sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and Royal Knights and Ladies end in trains. The heraldic shield of St. George's Cross encircled by the Garter is sewn onto the left shoulder of the mantle, but the Sovereign's mantle instead has the star of the Order. Attached to the mantle over the right shoulder are a dark red velvet hood and surcoat, which have lost all function over time and appear to the modern observer <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> splash of colour.|$|E
5|$|The {{photographs}} {{taken during the}} Klondike gold rush heavily influenced later cultural approaches to the stampede. The gold rush was vividly recorded by several early photographers, for instance Eric Hegg; these stark, black-and-white photographs showing the ascent of the Chilkoot pass rapidly became iconic images and were widely distributed. These pictures in turn inspired Charlie Chaplin to make The Gold Rush, a silent movie, which uses {{the background of the}} Klondike to combine physical comedy with its character's desperate battle for survival in the harsh conditions of the stampede. The photographs reappear in the documentary City of Gold from 1957 which, narrated by Pierre Berton, won prizes for pioneering the incorporation of still images into documentary film-making. The Klondike gold rush, however, has not been widely covered in later fictional films; even The Far Country, a Western from 1955 set in the Klondike, largely ignores the unique features of the gold rush in favour of a traditional Western plot. Indeed, much of the popular literature on the gold rush approaches the stampede <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> final phase of the expansion of the American West, a perception critiqued by modern historians such as Charlene Porsild.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes with}} Q and Picard {{together}} on a white background were compared {{to those in the}} Warren Beatty and Buck Henry 1978 film Heaven Can Wait by producer Merri Howard and director of photography Jonathan West. These particular scenes caused some problems as there were concerns by the director of photography that Q's white robes would not show up on camera well against the all-white background. They were worried that he might appear <b>simply</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> floating head. With both de Lancie and Stewart anticipating re-shoots for these scenes, they were both unhappy as they shot those appearances. However this was filmed late on the last day; de Lancie said that it resulted in both of them looking quite tired. Some scenes were cut {{in order to reduce the}} episode down to the required length. This included a one-page monologue by Marta which would have taken place on the morning after her liaison with Picard, a scene where Picard was to report to La Forge in engineering, audio mention of Dr. Selar and a mention of Scobee Hall – a reference to Dick Scobee, the commander of the Space Shuttle Challenger at the time of the destruction of the vessel.|$|E
