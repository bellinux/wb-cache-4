5|$|On 25 April 1949, {{locomotive}} No. 46230 Duchess of Buccleuch was hauling {{a passenger}} train that overran a <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> was derailed at Douglas Park Signal Box, Motherwell, Lanarkshire. The signalman was {{suspected of having}} deliberately moved points under the train.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} issuing the <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> turning his {{flagship}} HMS Queen Charlotte, Howe's plan began to falter. Many of the British captains had either misunderstood or ignored the <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> were hanging {{back in the}} original line. Other ships were still struggling with damage from Howe's earlier engagements and could not get into action fast enough. The result was a ragged formation tipped by Queen Charlotte that headed unevenly for Villaret's fleet. The French responded by firing on the British ships as they approached, {{but the lack of}} training and coordination in the French fleet was obvious; many ships which did obey Howe's order and attacked the French directly arrived in action without significant damage.|$|E
5|$|Another {{hardware}} quirk produced one of {{the most}} distinctive aspects of the ZX81's screen display – during loading or saving, moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen. The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the video <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> the tape output, producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers. The interference produces the zigzag stripes.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, the Doctor travels {{into the}} pocket {{universe}} and receives transmitted images of his companions in the subwave signal.

5|$|Early {{experiments}} with radiolabelled systemin in tomato demonstrated {{that it is}} transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants and was therefore {{thought to be the}} systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance.

It is now thought that jasmonic acid is the systemic <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> that systemin upregulates the pathways for jasmonic acid synthesis.|$|E

Kyo Maru II had developed boiler problems while returning from the Antarctic and was drifting towards the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, where she {{was in danger of}} being wrecked by the reefs in the area.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new emotion recognition method which combines electroencephalograph (EEG) <b>signals</b> <b>and</b> pupillary response collected from eye tracker. We select 15 emotional film clips of 3 categories (positive, neutral and negative). The EEG <b>signals</b> <b>and</b> eye tracking data of five participants are recorded, simultaneously, while watching these videos. We extract emotion-relevant features from EEG <b>signals</b> <b>and</b> eye tracing data of 12 experiments {{and build a}} fusion model to improve the performance of emotion recognition. The best average accuracies based on EEG <b>signals</b> <b>and</b> eye tracking data are 71. 77 % and 58. 90 %, respectively. We also achieve average accuracies of 73. 59 % and 72. 98 % for feature level fusion strategy and decision level fusion strategy, respectively. These results show that both feature level fusion and decision level fusion combining EEG <b>signals</b> <b>and</b> eye tracking data can improve the performance of emotion recognition model.
