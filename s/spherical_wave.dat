25|$|Though the Hulse–Taylor {{observations}} were very important, they give only indirect evidence for gravitational waves. A more conclusive observation {{would be a}} direct measurement {{of the effect of}} a passing gravitational wave, which could also provide more information about the system that generated it. Any such direct detection is complicated by the extraordinarily small effect the waves would produce on a detector. The amplitude of a <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> will fall off as the inverse of the distance from the source (the 1/R term in the formulas for h above). Thus, even waves from extreme systems like merging binary black holes die out to very small amplitudes by the time they reach the Earth. Astrophysicists expect that some gravitational waves passing the Earth may be as large as h ≈ 10−20, but generally no bigger.|$|E

In the study the 3 D problem of the sudden release of a particle which initially was inside a spherical trap, the exact solution for the particle's time evolution is described by expected traveling incoming and outgoing <b>spherical</b> <b>waves.</b> However, unexpected transient stationary <b>spherical</b> <b>waves</b> are also present. The traveling waves have amplitudes describing diffraction in time, in a way similar to the optical diffraction by a single slit. In striking contrast with the similar 1 D problem, the angular momentum generates unexpected transient stationary <b>spherical</b> <b>waves</b> which have their main contribution at points inside the sphere but only for very short times.

2500|$|One of the {{defining}} {{properties of the}} Lorentz transformation is its group structure which leaves the expression [...] invariant. So a <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> in one frame remains spherical in another one, which {{is often used to}} derive the Lorentz transformation. However, long before experiments and physical theories made the introduction of the Lorentz transformation necessary, transformation groups and sphere geometries transforming spheres into spheres have been discussed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{traditional}} classical physics diffraction arises {{because of}} the way in which waves propagate; this is described by the Huygens–Fresnel principle and the principle of superposition of waves. The propagation of a wave can be visualized by considering every particle of the transmitted medium on a wavefront as a point source for a secondary <b>spherical</b> <b>wave.</b> The wave displacement at any subsequent point is the sum of these secondary waves. When waves are added together, their sum is determined by the relative phases as well as the amplitudes of the individual waves so that the summed amplitude of the waves can have any value between zero and the sum of the individual amplitudes.

2500|$|Nearly {{simultaneously}} with Einstein, also Minkowski (1908) considered the special case of uniform accelerations {{within the framework}} of his space-time formalism. He recognized that the world-line of such an accelerated body corresponds to a hyperbola. This notion was further developed by Born (1909) and Sommerfeld (1910), with Born introducing the expression [...] "hyperbolic motion". He noted that uniform acceleration can be used as an approximation for any form of acceleration within special relativity. In addition, Harry Bateman and Ebenezer Cunningham (1910) showed that Maxwell's equations are invariant under a much wider group of transformation than the Lorentz-group, i.e., the <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> transformations, being a form of conformal transformations. Under those transformations the equations preserve their form for some types of accelerated motions. A general covariant formulation of electrodynamics in Minkowski space was eventually given by Friedrich Kottler (1912), whereby his formulation is also valid for general relativity. Concerning the further development of the description of accelerated motion in special relativity, the works by Langevin and others for rotating frames (Born coordinates), and by Wolfgang Rindler and others for uniform accelerated frames (Rindler coordinates) must be mentioned.|$|E

However, this covariance is restricted to certain areas such as electrodynamics, whereas the totality of natural laws in inertial frames is covariant under the Lorentz group.|$|E
60|$|To {{make the}} matter clear, {{we will take}} the {{simplest}} possible illustration. Consider a certain star, and suppose for the moment that its size is negligible. That is to say, we will regard it as, for practical purposes, a luminous point. Let us further suppose that it exists only for a very brief time, say a second. Then, according to physics, {{what happens is that}} a <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> of light travels outward from the star through space, just as, when you drop a stone into a stagnant pond, ripples travel outward from the place where the stone hit the water. The wave of light travels with a certain very nearly constant velocity, roughly 300,000 kilometres per second. This velocity may be ascertained by sending a flash of light to a mirror, and observing how long it takes before the reflected flash reaches you, just as the velocity of sound may be ascertained by means of an echo.|$|E
