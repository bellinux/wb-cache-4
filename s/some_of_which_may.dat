5|$|A {{string of}} forts was {{constructed}} in the north-east (<b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> date from the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen. However, only two forts in Scotland, at Cramond and Carpow (in the Tay valley) are definitely {{known to have been}} permanently occupied during this incursion before the troops were withdrawn again to Hadrian's Wall circa 213. There is some evidence that these campaigns are coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Dinefwr Park has {{a history}} of {{occupation}} spanning at least two millennia. A polished stone axe dated to the Neolithic period was unearthed on the site in 1976, and during the Iron Age, a farm existed on the property. The Romans later built a pair of forts here, with one partly overlying the other. There are traces of Roman roads and tracks, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> {{have been part of the}} Carmarthen–Llandovery Roman road. A Roman milestone and a coin hoard were unearthed near Dinefwr Castle, and pieces of amphorae and Samian items have been excavated near Dinefwr Farm.|$|E

5|$|Flies are {{adapted for}} aerial {{movement}} and typically have short and streamlined bodies. The first tagma of the fly, the head, bears the eyes, the antennae, and the mouthparts (the labrum, labium, mandible, and maxilla {{make up the}} mouthparts). The second tagma, the thorax, bears the wings and contains the flight muscles on the second segment, which is greatly enlarged; {{the first and third}} segments have been reduced to collar-like structures, and the third segment bears the halteres, which help to balance the insect during flight. The third tagma is the abdomen consisting of 11 segments, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> be fused, and with the 3 hindermost segments modified for reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{demolition}} of the tomb's chamber, some of the sarsens around the monument had been buried, while others had been left visible. Various buildings in Addington are partly made out of sarsen stone, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> {{have been removed from}} the long barrow. Ashbee also suspected that sarsens from this monument had been broken up for use in the repairs and extensions to the local church in the nineteenth century. The barrow was further damaged by the construction of the small road running through the middle of it.|$|E

5|$|The Voyager 2 {{spacecraft}} {{observed a}} strange {{signal from the}} ε ring during the radio occultation experiment. The signal looked like a strong enhancement of the forward-scattering at the wavelength 3.6cm near ring’s apoapsis. Such strong scattering requires {{the existence of a}} coherent structure. That the ε ring does have such a fine structure has been confirmed by many occultation observations. The ε ring seems to consist of a number of narrow and optically dense ringlets, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> have incomplete arcs.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> be obscured {{by a large}} pair of operculate gills, a thoracic shield (expanded part of the prothorax) or the developing wing pads. In most taxa up to seven pairs of gills arise from the top or sides of the abdomen, but in some species they are under the abdomen, and in a very few species the gills are instead located on the coxae of the legs, or the bases of the maxillae. The abdomen terminates in a pair of, or three, slender thread-like projections.|$|E

Some potbelly sculptures are wearing collars or clothing while others are apparently naked. There are examples with very prominent navels while other sculptures have no emphasis on the navel at all. Some examples of potbelly sculpture have chest ornaments and some sculptures are seated on pedestals. There are examples of potbelly sculptures corresponding to the general type that are not so fat as is the norm.|$|E

Tuatara are regarded as the messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster, and Māori women are forbidden to eat them. Tuatara also indicate tapu (the borders of what is sacred and restricted), beyond which there is mana, meaning there could be serious consequences if that boundary is crossed. Māori women would sometimes tattoo images of lizards, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> represent tuatara, near their genitals.

5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> {{be on the}} ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
5|$|A. H. A. Hogg {{identified}} {{four types}} of hillfort: contour forts, promontory forts, cliff forts and ridge forts. Contour forts, where banks and ditches are moulded {{to the shape of}} the hill, are the dominant form in Scotland. Less significant are promontory forts, usually employing coastal features, such as the largest one in Scotland at the Mull of Galloway. Different types of defensive style occurred throughout the Iron Age period, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> have been a response to Roman siege warfare. There were different combinations in the use of earth, stone or timber. Timber was frequently in-filled with stone or other materials. In continental Europe the timber is often arranged vertically, but in Scotland horizontal timbers were more common. The function of hillforts has been much debated. It was traditionally assumed that they were primarily defensive in nature, but {{in the late twentieth century}} this view began to be questioned and social, ritual and religious functions were emphasised.|$|E

5|$|Insects possess {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} a hard-jointed outer covering, the exoskeleton, made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, one to three simple eyes (ocelli) and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax {{and one or two}} pairs of wings. The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> be fused and houses the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive systems. There is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts, especially wings, legs, antennae and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki {{began her}} diary after she entered service at Shōshi's court. Much {{of what we}} know about her and her {{experiences}} at court comes from the diary, which covers the period from about 1008 to 1010. The long descriptive passages, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> have originated as letters, cover her relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga's temperament, the birth of Shōshi's sons—at Michinaga's mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace—and the process of writing Genji, including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions. Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half to the birth of Shōshi's son Emperor Go-Ichijō, an event of enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter's marriage which made him grandfather and de facto regent to an emperor.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike games create random tile-based levels, monster encounters, and {{treasure}} through procedural generation on each new game. Preferably roguelikes {{adhering to the}} Berlin Interpretation use ASCII-based graphics. They may include pre-determined levels as well, such as a town level common to the Moria family where the player can buy and sell equipment. Generated layouts typically incorporate rooms connected by corridors, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> be preset to some degree (e.g., monster lairs or treasuries). Open areas or natural features, such as rivers, may occur, though these are considered against the Berlin Interpretation. While early roguelikes would have levels confined to the bounds of the terminal screen, other roguelikes enabled a much larger level size, only a portion shown to the player as they moved around it.|$|E
