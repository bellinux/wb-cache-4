Santos {{recorded}} [...] "Despedida" [...] (My Good-bye), a farewell song written by Flores {{from the viewpoint}} of an Army recruit who had to leave behind his girlfriend and his ailing mother, which became a hit. Santos recalled in an interview once that he had to hold back tears while recording the song, since his draft papers had just arrived and he would soon have to live a situation similar to what the song's lyrics described, but that a friend started mocking him at the control booth, to which he decided to curse him on the <b>spot,</b> <b>trading</b> the word mama'o (an expletive in Puerto Rican Spanish) for mamá (mother). This incident produced two mannerisms that Santos eventually adopted in his singing style: chopped delivery (almost syllable by syllable, as suggested by Flores) and stretched last vowel in the last verse of each stanza, in almost every song he recorded afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|A spot {{transaction}} is {{a two-day}} delivery transaction (except {{in the case}} of trades between the US dollar, Canadian dollar, Turkish lira, euro and Russian ruble, which settle the next business day), as opposed to the futures contracts, which are usually three months.

5000|$|At {{the center}} of the {{investigation}} are the transcripts of electronic chatrooms in which senior currency traders discussed with their competitors at other banks the types and volume of the trades they planned to place. The electronic chatrooms had names such as [...] "The Cartel", [...] "The Bandits’ Club", [...] "One Team, One Dream" [...] and [...] "The Mafia". The discussions in the chatrooms were interspersed with jokes about manipulating the forex market and repeated references to alcohol, drugs, and women. Regulators are particularly focusing in on one small exclusive chatroom which was variously called The Cartel or The Mafia. The chatroom was used by some of the most influential traders in London and membership in the chatroom was highly sought after.

40|$|The {{regional}} {{natural gas}} markets {{are expected to}} gradually become more integrated. The major driving forces are lower LNG costs, more <b>spot</b> <b>trade,</b> and increased need for imports into the US and other key markets. In this paper we examine various scenarios for a future global gas market, particularly focusing on natural gas prices and trade patterns. We use a numerical model of the international energy markets, with detailed modelling of regional gas production and international gas transport. Scenarios with different assumptions about future demand and supply conditions are simulated. Our results suggest that trade between continents will grow considerably {{over the next couple}} of decades, and that prices in the main import regions will remain around current levels. However, significant constraints on exports from the Middle East may alter this picture. ...|$|R
