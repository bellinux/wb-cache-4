40|$|The flag o’er our vessel is flying, And waves o’er the billowy sea I go, But my sad {{heart is}} sighing, For home and friends so dear to me. And while I call up scenes departed, Remember me, {{mother on the}} sea In faith I yield, though from thee parted, My <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> God, my heart to thee! In faith I yield, though from thee parted, My <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> God, my <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> God, my heart to thee! I hear the gay songs wildly floating, They pleasantly fall on the ear; But how can the heart be devoting The time to thoughtless revel here! And when in distant lands I’m dreaming, O’er faded joys from passion free, I fondly give, in faith redeeming, My <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> God, my heart to thee! I fondly give, in faith redeeming, My <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> God, my <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> God, my heart to thee!

I give in faith, though lowly sleeping, My <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> God, my <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> God, my heart to thee...|$|R

5|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{interpretation}} of the Upanishad is a qualified monism. Ramanuja interprets the Upanishadic literature to be teaching a body-soul theory, states Jeaneane Fowler – a professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, where the Brahman is the dweller in all things, yet also distinct and beyond all things, as the soul, the inner controller, the immortal. The Upanishads, according to the Vishishtadvaita school, teach individual <b>souls</b> <b>to</b> be of the same quality as the Brahman, but quantitatively they are distinct.|$|E

60|$|Here, therefore, we have {{a closing}} word indeed; a word to wrap up the text with that is as full of good as the sun is of light. What can be fitter spoken? What can be added? What now is wanting to the help of him that has {{committed}} his <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> God to keep it while he is suffering {{according to his will}} in the world? He is engaged, as I said, by that act; thou hast committed thy <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> him to keep; he is engaged by his own Word; he has bidden thee commit thy <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> him to keep. He is engaged by his declaring of himself to be faithful; for that has encouraged thee <b>to</b> commit thy <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> him to keep. Besides, he has promised to do it; he has sworn to do it.|$|R

5|$|The {{fourth season}} of the Bleach anime series was {{directed}} by Noriyuki Abe and produced by Studio Pierrot. Like {{the rest of the}} series, it follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki, but instead of adapting Tite Kubo's Bleach manga, it features an original, self-contained story arc. The twenty-eight episodes form the , which focuses on the introduction of the Bount, a race of humans that consume human <b>souls</b> <b>to</b> extend their lives, and their conflicts with Ichigo Kurosaki and his allies.|$|E
5|$|Bullet souls {{are often}} projectiles, and consume a set amount of magic points upon use. Guardian souls provide {{continuous}} effects, including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning of familiars. The movement and attacking of familiars {{can be directly}} controlled with the stylus. Guardian souls continually drain magic points {{so long as they}} are activated. Several Guardian souls can be used in conjunction with Bullet <b>souls</b> <b>to</b> execute special attacks called Tactical Soul combos. Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are passive, and require no magic points to remain active. Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore not equipped, nor do they consume magic points. Some examples include the ability to break ice blocks with the stylus, and the ability to double-jump.|$|E

5|$|In most Scottish burghs, in {{contrast}} to English towns where churches and parishes tended to proliferate, there was usually only one parish church, As the doctrine of Purgatory gained importance in the period, the number of chapelries, priests and masses for the dead within them, designed to speed the passage of <b>souls</b> <b>to</b> Heaven, grew rapidly. The number of altars dedicated to saints, who could intercede in this process, also grew dramatically, with St. Mary's in Dundee having perhaps 48 and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50. The number of saints celebrated in Scotland also proliferated, with about 90 being added to the missal used in St Nicholas church in Aberdeen. New cults of devotion connected with Jesus and the Virgin Mary began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century, including the Five Wounds, the Holy Blood and the Holy Name of Jesus. There were also new religious feasts, including celebrations of the Presentation, the Visitation and Mary of the Snows.|$|E
5|$|Soma meets Arikado, who is {{initially}} angered by Soma's presence, but accepts the situation. He gives Soma {{a letter and}} a talisman from Mina. Soma briefs Arikado on the current situation, and Arikado leaves to locate Dario. Soma comes upon Dario and Julius, with the latter defeated due to his inability to use the Magic Seals. Dario retreats, instructing Soma to fight him in the castle's throne room. Soma does so, lambasting Dario for only desiring power, and promising to defeat him. Before the battle begins, Soma uses one of his <b>souls</b> <b>to</b> transport himself into the mirror in the room, revealing Aguni, the flame demon sealed within Dario's soul. Soma defeats Aguni, leaving Dario powerless. As Dario flees, Celia arrives, and instructs Soma {{to come to the}} castle's center.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in {{previous}} games, magical abilities are learned with {{the acquisition of}} a new weapon, giving each weapon its own magic attack; for example, the Army of Sparta may only be used with the Blades of Exile. Magic gives Kratos {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies, such as the Claws of Hades' Soul Summon ability, which conjures <b>souls</b> <b>to</b> attack enemies. Other magic includes the Nemean Cestus' Nemean Roar and the Nemesis Whip's Nemesis Rage. In addition to four primary weapons, three secondary ones, known as Items, are acquired: the Bow of Apollo, the Head of Helios, and the Boots of Hermes. All three are required to advance in certain stages of the game; for example, the Head of Helios {{can be used as a}} lantern in dark areas and to reveal hidden doorways.|$|E

25|$|God, having {{created the}} universe, then created the divisions, the worlds, and various gods and goddesses, whom he {{appointed}} to {{certain parts of}} the universe.

25|$|Zoroastrianism has {{historically}} suggested several possible fates for the wicked, including annihilation, purgation in molten metal, and eternal punishment, {{all of which}} have standing in Zoroaster's writings. Zoroastrian eschatology includes the belief that wicked souls will remain in hell until, following the arrival of three saviors at thousand-year intervals, Ahura Mazda reconciles the world, destroying evil and resurrecting tormented <b>souls</b> <b>to</b> perfection.|$|E
50|$|According to the Hua-yen Sutra evil deeds {{will cause}} a <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> be born in {{different}} realms. There are six possible realms of existence for souls.The highest degree of evil deed {{will cause a}} <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> be born into a realm as a denizen of hell, the lower degree of that would cause a <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> be born as an animal, and the lowest degree would cause a <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> be born as a hungry ghost.Evil deeds that lead to becoming a hungry ghost would be killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. Desire, greed, anger, and ignorance are all factors in causing a <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> be reborn as a hungry ghost because they are motives for people to perform evil deeds. The least serious of these will cause one to have the destiny of becoming a hungry ghost.|$|R

25|$|In 1553 Michael Servetus {{published}} {{yet another}} religious work with further anti-trinitarian views. It was entitled Christianismi Restitutio (The Restoration of Christianity), {{a work that}} sharply rejected the idea of predestination as the idea that God condemned <b>souls</b> <b>to</b> Hell regardless of worth or merit. God, insisted Servetus, condemns no one who does not condemn himself through thought, word or deed. This work also includes the first published description of the pulmonary circulation.|$|E
