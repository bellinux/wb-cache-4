The International Bridge and its {{approaches}} opened in Sault Ste. Marie on October 31, 1962. The following year, a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> opened in the Detroit area. The freeway was extended south from Pontiac to 11Mile Road with a connection along M-150 to M-102 (8Mile Road). Another section opened to connect with US24 (Telegraph Road) in the Woodhaven area; a TO I-75 designation was added to connect along US24 and M-102 to M-150. On {{the other end of}} the state, the gaps in the freeway across the UP were completed in 1963 as well, and {{the section of}} freeway in Northern Michigan was named the most scenic new highway in the US in 1963 by Parade magazine. The first part of the Chrysler Freeway opened to traffic on June 26, 1964, the southern mile (1.6km) of which was designated I-375.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background With the {{increasing}} availability of live cell imaging technology, tracking cells and other moving objects in live cell videos {{has become a}} major challenge for bioimage informatics. An inherent problem for most cell tracking algorithms is over- or under-segmentation of cells – many algorithms tend to recognize one cell as several cells or vice versa. Results We propose to approach this problem through so-called topological alignments, which we apply {{to address the problem of}} linking segmentations of two consecutive frames in the video sequence. Starting from the output of a conventional segmentation procedure, we align pairs of consecutive frames through assigning <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> in one frame to <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> in the next frame. We achieve this through finding maximum weighted solutions to a generalized "bipartite matching" between two hierarchies <b>of</b> <b>segments,</b> where we derive weights from relative overlap scores of convex hulls <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments.</b> For solving the matching task, we rely on an integer linear program. Conclusion Practical experiments demonstrate that the matching task can be solved efficiently in practice, and that our method is both effective and useful for tracking cells in data sets derived from a so-called Large Scale Digital Cell Analysis System (LSDCAS).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{algorithms}} {{for a number}} of problems in geometric pattern matching where the input consists of a collection <b>of</b> orthogonal <b>segments</b> in the plane. Such collections arise naturally from problems in mapping buildings and robot exploration. We propose a new criterion for segment similarity called the coverage measure, and present efficient algorithms for maximizing it between <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> axis-parallel <b>segments</b> under translations. In the general case, we present a procedure running in time O(n log ¡ n), and for the case when all segments are horizontal, we give a procedure that runs in time O(n ¡ log ¡ n). Here n is the number <b>of</b> <b>segments.</b> In addition, we show that an ε-approximation to the Hausdorff distance between two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> horizontal <b>segments</b> under vertical translations can be computed in time O(n  £¢¤ ¡ max(poly(log M, log n, 1 /ε))). Here, M denotes the ratio of the diameter to the closest pair of points in the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> (where pairs <b>of</b> points lie on different segments).
