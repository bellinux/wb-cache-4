5|$|Cheddar Wood and {{the smaller}} Macall's Wood form a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest from {{what remains of the}} wood of the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13thcentury and of King Edmund the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19thcentury, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The wood was coppiced until 1917. This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood. Butterflies include silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) and brown argus (Aricia agestis). The slug Arion fasciatus, which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> Cantharis fusca also occur.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is rich in}} wildlife. Insects {{found here}} that are scarce in the UK include the {{bleached}} pug (Eupithecia expallidata) and alder kitten (Furcula bicuspis) moths, {{as well as the}} <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> species Malthius frontalis. Locally scarce insects include the green hairstreak butterfly (Callophrys rubi) and the common glow-worm (Lampyris noctiluca). The site provides a habitat for butterflies, with common species including the comma, gatekeeper, red admiral, speckled wood and tortoiseshell.|$|E
25|$|A {{large area}} of the southerly hill is {{protected}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for its biological importance; much of this hill {{is owned by the}} National Trust. Its summit plateau has an extensive area of lowland heath, a rare habitat in Cheshire, and one that is particularly important for reptiles. A substantial population of Lobed Maidenhair Spleenwort, a fern that is rare in Britain, is found here. Nationally scarce species observed in the area include the bleached pug and alder kitten moths, and the Malthus frontalis species of <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle.</b> The western escarpment of the northerly hill has also been designated an SSSI for its exposed Triassic sandstones.|$|E

50|$|Veresina occidentalis {{can be used}} in {{the home}} garden for insect control. Verbesina occidentalis attracts the <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle.</b> The <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> is {{attracted}} to the plant for two reasons. It is believed that the <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> is attracted to Verbesina occidentalis due to its coloration. The <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> is also yellow and can hide among the flowers. The <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> will also drink the nectar from the plant. When the <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> drinks the nectar it does not harm the plant. Both the adult and larva of the <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> will prey on other insects. The adult soldier beetles will eat the aphids, caterpillars, grasshopper eggs and mites. The larva of the <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> hatches in the spring. The larva soldier beetles prey upon insect eggs, larva, snails, and slugs.

Studying insects’ {{response}} to disturbance {{can tell us}} how these organisms survive in hostile environments. Studies have shown that <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles</b> can have different mating behaviors depending on the species around them (Bernstein and Bernstein, 1999). They also exercise selective mating in changing ecological conditions (McLain, 2005). When disturbed, beetles are known to drop off plants onto the ground {{in order to get}} away from possible predators (Ben-Ari and Inbar, 2013). The goal of this experiment was to determine any trends in {{response to}} a probing disturbance by insects and more specifically, <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles.</b> I believed probing <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles</b> with a small disturbance would cause them {{to move away from the}} source of the disturbance, with individuals responding more than mating pairs. After collecting and analyzing the data, the conclusion is that the hypothesis is supported by having a greater reaction from individuals than mating pairs. These results suggest that an insect’s tolerance to disturbance increases when mating. This may lead to a decrease in survival behavior in order to fulfill mating interests...|$|R
50|$|Chauliognathus is a genus of <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles</b> in {{the family}} Cantharidae. Adults have almost {{rectangular}} bodies. Some are red and black, similar to the military uniforms that were common before the usage of camouflage, hence the name of <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles.</b> Others are orange and black. The elytra or first pair of wings are softer than the elytra of most beetles, that is why their other common name is leatherwings. The adults are frequently found on flowers, such as sunflowers, goldenrod, coneflowers, where they mate and feed on pollen and nectar. The larvae are {{more common in the}} ground or among debris, where they feed on eggs or larvae of other insects. The adults are most frequently found in summer and early fall.They are native to America.|$|R

5|$|The {{forewings}} of beetles are {{not used}} for flight, but form elytra which cover the hind {{part of the body}} and protect the hindwings. The elytra are usually hard shell-like structures which must be raised to allow the hind wings to move for flight.

Other soft wing beetles include the net-winged beetle Calopteron discrepans, which has brittle wings that rupture easily in order to release chemicals for defence.|$|R
