5|$|Miners of the Pittston Coal Company {{were glad}} that a {{settlement}} {{had been reached}} {{and that they would}} once again be receiving health and retirement funds. However, because they were without benefits for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> many people had gone into financial trouble. During the strike, the costs of health care had to be paid out of pocket and many miners did not have the resources to do so. As a result, many miners had accumulated debt. Another direct result of the Pittston Strike was the formation of the Coal Act. This act was established in 1992. This act made it mandatory by law for mining companies to provide health and retirement benefits for its workers.|$|E
5|$|Punk cited {{his health}} {{as the main}} reason he left WWE, {{describing}} that in his final months in the company, {{he had been working}} through an untreated and potentially fatal MRSA infection, broken ribs, injured knees, and multiple concussions including one at the Royal Rumble, as well as having lost his appetite and ability to sleep well. Punk felt that WWE was pressuring and rushing him to wrestle before he had fully recovered. According to him, he found a lump on his back in November 2013 and it was diagnosed as a fatty deposit by Dr. Chris Amann, who refused to remove it despite Punk's requests. The week after Punk left WWE, his wife April Mendez convinced him to get the lump checked by her doctor. The doctor diagnosed it as a MRSA infection and told Punk that he could have died due to ignoring it for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> Punk had the doctor evacuate the infection, describing it as the worst pain in his life, but said that once it was treated and he was on stronger medication, he was able to sleep better than he had in weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} viewed {{events in}} Poland with alarm. De-Stalinisation was underway in the Soviet Union as well, but the Soviet leadership did not view the democratic reform that the Polish public desired as an acceptable solution. In Moscow, the belief was that any liberalisation in one bloc country {{could lead to}} the destruction of communism and the ruin of Soviet influence in the region as a whole. The Soviet Union was not worried solely about the political implications of reform but about the economic implications as well. Economically, the Soviet Union heavily invested in much of the Eastern Bloc and was striving for integration of its economies. The Soviet Union had financed Polish industry and was Poland's main trading partner. The Soviet Union directed what products Poland manufactured; the Soviets bought the products and exported goods to Poland no longer produced within the country itself. Due to this integration, any reform, whether political or economic, in one of the countries would inevitably have a great impact on the other. Because Poland was inextricably connected to the Soviet Union economically, the thought of an independent Polish economy was unrealistic. The country had been forced to rely on the Soviets for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> that breaking away completely would prove disastrous. Thus, both countries held crucial power in different facets. Poland could threaten Soviet strength and power in Eastern Europe politically, and the Soviet Union could essentially destroy the Polish economy. Therefore, any reform in the Polish government would have to concede to some Soviet demands, while the Soviets concurrently would have to concede to a vital partner.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{remoteness}} {{from human}} habitation and its arid environment, the site remained largely untouched by humans or nature for two millennia. The Roman attack ramp still {{stands on the}} western side and can be climbed on foot. Many of the ancient buildings have been restored from their remains, as have the wall paintings of Herod's two main palaces, and the Roman-style bathhouses that he built. The synagogue, storehouses, and houses of the Jewish rebels have also been identified and restored. The meter-high circumvallation wall that the Romans built around Masada can be seen, together with 11 barracks for the Roman soldiers just outside this wall. Water cisterns two-thirds of the way up the cliff drain the nearby wadis by an elaborate system of channels, which explains how the rebels managed to conserve enough water for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|Silent Hills screenwriter, Roger Avary, {{used the}} town of Centralia, Pennsylvania as an {{inspiration}} for {{the town of}} Silent Hill; Avary commented that as a boy, his father, who was a mining engineer, used to tell him stories about Centralia, where coal deposits from the local mine caught fire and released toxic gases into the town, as well as creating sinkholes when the abandoned mineshafts and coal seams began to collapse. This forced the town to evacuate forever. Avary was fascinated since childhood {{by the idea that}} fires underneath the town would be burning for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> When the script was finished, a studio memo was sent to Gans and Avary that voiced concerns about the lack of a male presence in the film, since the original story contained a nearly all female cast. Gans and Avary added Christopher's character (named after Gans) and subplot and the script was approved.|$|E
25|$|Later, Sae {{leaves for}} New York and meets up with Junichi, and they worked {{together}} in the same company. Junichi proposed to Sae later on. Sae returned to Kushiro to attend her friend Minami's wedding, and she found out that Kouhei was married to Ritsuko. However, Ritsuko was jealous of the way Sae and her husband were interacting. Kouhei then met Sae at the lighthouse, and Sae tells him that this might be the last time she visits Japan since she may get married. Having seen each other after <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> they can't resist anymore and they embrace each other passionately in front of Sae's house while dropping her off, but their responsibilities towards their better halves (in her case, her fiancé) force them to reluctantly part ways. When Kouhei returned, he found Ritsuko waiting for him on the steps with bad news- the bank might make them bankrupt. Kouhei manages to settle the problem, but he found Ritsuko's divorce papers on the table when he returned. The scene ends with a news report stating that Junichi was killed in Iraq.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} confirm whether the lime had {{transformed}} into calcite completely, the pH of the SLM was calculated.

25|$|In summer 1985, Ballard was {{aboard the}} French {{research}} ship Le Suroît, which {{was using the}} side scan sonar SAR {{to search for the}} Titanics wreck. When the French ship was recalled, he transferred onto a ship from Woods Hole, the R/V Knorr. Unbeknownst to some, this trip was financed by the U.S. Navy for secret reconnaissance of the wreckage of two Navy nuclear powered attack submarines, the USS Scorpion and the USS Thresher, which sank in the 1960s, and not for the Titanic. Back in 1982, he approached the Navy about his new deep sea underwater robot craft, the Argo, and his search for the Titanic. The Navy was not interested in financing it. However, they were interested in finding out what happened to their missing submarines and ultimately concluded that Argo was their best chance to do so. The Navy agreed it would finance his Titanic search only if he first searched for and investigated the two sunken submarines, and found out the state of their nuclear reactors after being submerged for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> and whether their radioactivity was impacting the environment. He was placed on temporary active duty in the Navy, in charge of finding and investigating the wrecks. After the two missions were completed, time and funding permitting, he was free to use resources to hunt for the Titanic.|$|E
25|$|As for the {{required}} vocal {{range of the}} title role, it is an extraordinary case: The highest note is the high B5, not irregular for a soprano or mezzo-soprano to sing, while the lowest note is a low G3, in the contralto range and officially below the standard range for a mezzo-soprano. Considering this range, {{which is similar to}} many mezzo roles (such as Carmen and Amneris), one might assume that a high soprano is not essential to the piece, but it is; most of the relatively low sopranos who attempted this role found themselves straining their voices throughout the opera, and having reached the closing scene (the {{most important part of the}} opera for the title role) were very fatigued. This role is the classic example of the difference between tessitura and absolute vocal range: While mezzos can perform a high note (like Carmen), or even temporarily sustain a high tessitura, it is impossible for a singer to spend <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> (with the needed strength and breath-control) in the second octave above the middle C unless she is a high soprano. Moreover, the low G occurs twice in the opera, and in both cases it is in pianissimo—more of a theatrical effect than music—and can be growled instead of sung. The other low notes required are no lower than low A, and they are also quiet.|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{geographical}} scope, {{some historians}} including Kasahara {{deny that the}} massacre ended in early February and instead put the end date at March 28, though <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> range is disputed by other historians. On the other hand, at least one historian has noted that the atrocity in Nanking could be equated with the entire war waged by Japan on China. By this definition the [...] "Nanking Massacre" [...] can symbolically {{be said to have}} lasted from 1931 to 1945, extended over the whole of China, and included ten million victims.|$|E
