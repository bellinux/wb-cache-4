5|$|Oganesson is {{expected}} to have by far the broadest polarizability of all elements before it in the periodic table, almost double that of radon. By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it {{is expected}} that oganesson has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This {{is very different from the}} previously estimated values of 263K or 247 K. Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that oganesson would be a gas under <b>standard</b> <b>conditions,</b> and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be solid at <b>standard</b> <b>conditions.</b> If oganesson forms a gas under <b>standard</b> <b>conditions</b> nevertheless, it would be one of the densest gaseous substances at <b>standard</b> <b>conditions,</b> even if it is monatomic like the other noble gases.|$|E

This study used an experimental design {{to test the hypothesis}} that manipulating personal standards, a central feature of perfectionism, would influence eating attitudes and behaviour. Forty-one healthy women were randomly assigned either to a high personal <b>standards</b> <b>condition</b> (n= 18) or to a low personal <b>standards</b> <b>condition</b> for 24 h (n= 23). Measures of personal standards, perfectionism, and eating attitudes and behaviour were taken before and after the experimental manipulation. The manipulation was successful.

5|$|Fluorine is a {{chemical}} element with symbol F and atomic number 9.

5|$|Helium is {{the second}} least {{reactive}} noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements. It is chemically inert and monatomic in all <b>standard</b> <b>conditions.</b> Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and {{the small size of}} helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|Lutetium metal is {{slightly}} unstable in air at <b>standard</b> <b>conditions,</b> but it burns readily at 150°C to form lutetium oxide. The resulting compound {{is known to}} absorb water and carbon dioxide, and {{may be used to}} remove vapors of these compounds from closed atmospheres. Similar observations are made during reaction between lutetium and water (slow when cold and fast when hot); lutetium hydroxide is formed in the reaction. Lutetium metal is known to react with the four lightest halogens to form trihalides; all of them (except the fluoride) are soluble in water.|$|E
5|$|Thallium is {{the first}} element in group 13 where the {{reduction}} of the +3 oxidation state to the +1 oxidation state is spontaneous under <b>standard</b> <b>conditions.</b> Since bond energies decrease down the group, by thallium, the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the 6s-electrons. Accordingly, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide are more acidic, showing that thallium conforms to the general rule of elements being more electropositive in their lower oxidation states.|$|E
5|$|The allotropes {{of carbon}} include graphite, {{one of the}} softest known substances, and diamond, the hardest {{naturally}} occurring substance. It bonds readily with other small atoms including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with suitable, multivalent atoms. Carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds, {{a large majority of}} all chemical compounds. Carbon also has the highest sublimation point of all elements. At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330°C or 7,820°F), so it sublimes at about 3,900K. Graphite is much more reactive than diamond at <b>standard</b> <b>conditions,</b> despite being more thermodynamically stable, as its delocalised pi system is much more vulnerable to attack. For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated nitric acid at <b>standard</b> <b>conditions</b> to mellitic acid, C6(CO2H)6, which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.|$|E

30|$|Alkalis and {{surfactant}} {{were two}} chemicals {{used in this}} study in order to purify and recover PHB from fresh biomass. Initially sole NaOH treatments with different concentration and treatment time were conducted (see Table  1). The final product purity increased by increasing NaOH concentration or by the prolonged treatment time, but the recovery yield was negatively influenced by those two parameters. On the basis of the final product purity and recovery yield, the treatment with 0.2  M NaOH for 1  h was chosen as the <b>standard</b> <b>condition</b> (see Table  1). Under this <b>standard</b> <b>condition,</b> the final product purity and the recovery yield can reach 87 % and 97 %, respectively. In order to improve the purity from the <b>standard</b> <b>condition,</b> and to favor the sustainability of the process, different chemicals combinations were tested. With the purpose of improving the purity, surfactant was added to the <b>standard</b> <b>condition</b> to remove the cell materials further. With additional dosage of SDS to our <b>standard</b> <b>condition,</b> the purity can be improved up to 99 % with a slight decrease in recovery yield (91 %). NH 4 OH was aimed at replacing NaOH, because it is potentially easier to be recycled than NaOH (van Hee et al. 2005). However, significant decrease was observed in both purity (to 63 %) and recovery yield (63 %) when treating fresh biomass with 0.2  M NH 4 OH.|$|R

40|$|The {{correlation}} between grain boundary microstructure and fatigue crack growth with hold-times was investigated for two {{conditions of the}} superalloy Allvac 718 Plus; a <b>Standard</b> <b>condition</b> with the recommended distribution of grain boundary phases and a Clean condition with virtually no grain boundary phases. Fatigue testing was performed at 704 degrees C using 10 Hz cyclic load with intermittent hold-times of 100 s at maximum tensile load. Microstructural characterization and fractography were conducted using scanning- and transmission electron microscopy techniques. Auger electron- and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques were used for oxide analyses on fracture surfaces. It was found that in the <b>Standard</b> <b>condition</b> crack growth is mostly transgranular for 10 Hz loading and intergranular for hold-times, while for the Clean condition crack growth is intergranular in both load modes. The lower hold-time crack growth rates in the <b>Standard</b> <b>condition</b> are attributed to grain boundary delta-phase precipitates. No effect of delta-phase was observed for 10 Hz cyclic loading crack growth rates. Two different types of oxides and oxide colours {{were found on the}} fracture surfaces in the <b>Standard</b> <b>condition</b> and could be correlated to the different loading modes. For cyclic loading a bright thin Cr-enriched oxide was dominate and for hold-times a dark and slightly thicker Nb-enriched oxide was dominant These oxide types could be related to the oxidation of delta-phase and the matrix respectively. The influence of delta-phase precipitates on crack propagation is discussed...|$|R
