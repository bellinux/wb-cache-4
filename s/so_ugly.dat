5|$|In 2006 Shearer {{appeared}} with Brian Hayes in four episodes of the BBC Radio 4 sitcom Not Today, Thank You, playing Nostrils, a man <b>so</b> <b>ugly</b> he cannot {{stand to be}} in his own presence. He was originally scheduled to appear in all six episodes but had to withdraw from recording two due to a problem with his work permit. On June 19, 2008, it was announced that Shearer would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the radio category. The date of the ceremony where his star will be put in place has yet to be announced.|$|E

25|$|The {{group is}} so angular, so Cubist, <b>so</b> <b>ugly</b> {{according}} to accepted notions, that few look {{long enough to}} see what the sculptor means; yet strange as the group was it undeniably gave a powerful impression of the binding, the blending character of the family tie, a much more powerful impression than groups in conventional academic pose could give.|$|E

But I kept a lock for you;' and feebly she drew from under the pillow a long auburn tress, and tried to wreathe it round his neck, but could not, and sunk back.|$|R
60|$|Her heart halted. Brinsley Street was {{a school}} in a poor quarter, and {{she had had a}} taste of the common {{children}} of Ilkeston. They had shouted after her and thrown stones. Still, as a teacher, she would be in authority. And it was all unknown. She was excited. The very forest of dry, sterile brick had some fascination for her. It was <b>so</b> hard and <b>ugly,</b> <b>so</b> relentlessly <b>ugly,</b> it would purge her of some of her floating sentimentality.|$|R

500|$|Bridgewater Place is {{currently}} the tallest building in Leeds and the second tallest structure in Yorkshire after the Emley Moor Television Transmitter (near Huddersfield). The building comprises offices, flats, shops and restaurants. Bridgewater Place is [...] tall and has 32 storeys. The original design included a spire, but this was never added. In 2008, Building Design, the architectural journal, shortlisted Bridgewater Place for the Carbuncle Cup, which is awarded to 'buildings <b>so</b> <b>ugly</b> they freeze the heart'.|$|E
500|$|During the Great Depression, {{buildings}} {{suffered from}} a lack of maintenance. Writer Sinclair Lewis, returning to Minneapolis after a long absence, said, [...] "Minneapolis is <b>so</b> <b>ugly.</b> Parking lots like scars. Most buildings are narrow, drab, dirty, flimsy, irregular in relationship to one another— a set of bad teeth." [...] A decade later, downtown and surrounding areas would be reshaped radically by urban renewal and freeway construction. After World War II, businesses and residents started moving to the suburbs, and downtown Minneapolis, along with downtowns across the nation, was perceived as dying. Urban planners, such as Le Corbusier, were advocating radically rebuilding downtowns by complete rebuilding and forcing out manufacturing and warehousing. The Federal Housing Act of 1949 provided funding for clearing blighted areas, and city officials interpreted the definition of [...] "blighted" [...] liberally. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 provided funding for an interstate highway system, which would also transform Minneapolis.|$|E
500|$|Although {{she had not}} set out to {{make her}} career in film, Robert De Niro's {{performance}} in Taxi Driver (1976) {{had a profound impact on}} young Streep, who said to herself, [...] "that's the kind of actor I want to be when I grow up". Streep began auditioning for film roles, and underwent an unsuccessful audition for the lead role in Dino De Laurentiis's King Kong. Laurentiis stated in Italian to his son: [...] "This is <b>so</b> <b>ugly.</b> Why did you bring me this". Unknown to Laurentiis, Streep understood Italian and she remarked, [...] "I'm very sorry that I'm not as beautiful as I should be but, you know—this is it. This is what you get". She continued to work on Broadway, appearing in the 1976 double bill of Tennessee Williams' 27 Wagons Full of Cotton and Arthur Miller's A Memory of Two Mondays. For the former, she received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Streep's other Broadway credits include Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard and the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical Happy End, in which she had originally appeared off-Broadway at the Chelsea Theater Center. She received Drama Desk Award nominations for both productions.|$|E

2500|$|He often created lyrics as {{witty and}} humorous adaptations of folk music themes. The song [...] "Bo Diddley" [...] {{was based on}} the African-American {{clapping}} rhyme [...] "Hambone" [...] (which in turn {{was based on the}} lullaby [...] "Hush Little Baby"). Likewise, [...] "Hey Bo Diddley" [...] is based on the song [...] "Old MacDonald". The song [...] "Who Do You Love?" [...] with its rap-style boasting, and his use of the African-American game known as [...] "the dozens" [...] on the songs [...] "Say Man" [...] and [...] "Say Man, Back Again," [...] are cited as progenitors of hip-hop music (for example, [...] "You got the nerve to call somebody ugly. Why, you <b>so</b> <b>ugly,</b> the stork that brought you into the world ought to be arrested").|$|E

2500|$|Channing {{made her}} {{television}} debut on Sesame Street {{in the role}} of The Number Painter's female victim. She landed her first leading role in the 1973 television movie The Girl Most Likely to..., a black comedy written by Joan Rivers about an ugly duckling woman made newly beautiful by plastic surgery after an auto accident vows murderous revenge on all who had scorned her. For the role, Channing went through considerable transformation, with the syndicated column [...] "TV Scout" [...] reporting months later, [...] "It was a great make-up job — at least the part that made very pretty Stockard look <b>so</b> <b>ugly.</b> She had her cheeks puffed out with cotton and her nose was wadded, too, to make it thick and off-center. Very thick eyebrows were drawn on her face and she wore padded clothes to make her look fat. Making her look beautiful was easy." [...] The TV movie has gone on to enjoy cult status, becoming available on DVD in 2005.|$|E
