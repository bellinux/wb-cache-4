40|$|Perception {{of scale}} is {{important}} to our activity within a space and to our experience of a landscape. This presents a problem if people cannot predict or convey the <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> of large structures proposed in a landscape, {{as has been the}} case for recent wind turbine proposals in Scotland. To address this problem, this research explored how people perceive <b>scale</b> and <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> in a landscape. It took wind turbines as an example structure and analysed how different scales of windfarm create different <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> in different landscapes, as well as how to best assess and communicate these effects. The research applied three methods to address the research questions: Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (LVIA), which is a standard, structured process applied by professional landscape architects; experiential landscape assessment, which included semi-structured interviews with local people in addition to site assessment; and public attitude and preference study, which included Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint analysis (ACBC). These different methods allowed the research questions to be explored in different ways, while overlapping in some aspects and providing triangulation. The research findings revealed that our perception of <b>scale</b> and <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> in a landscape is influenced by numerous attributes and depends on how these are experienced together. Building upon the theoretical background, an important difference between visual scale and spatial scale was highlighted, as well as alternative ways in which scale references are made. Throughout the research, the need for clear communication was emphasised and the findings included identifying the specific words that people use to describe <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> in the most discriminating way. This research supported other studies in finding that consultation with local people (professionals and the public) was vital to understand in sufficient depth how a landscape was perceived, experienced and valued. In addition, the innovative development of Conjoint Analysis demonstrated how this method can reveal how people judge the relative importance of different attributes that influence landscape and visual effects and, by doing so, offer new possibilities as a tool in landscape research. Building upon the general findings concerning scale, specific findings regarding the <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> of windfarms included: greater influence of the proximity of a windfarm than size or numbers of wind turbines; greater importance for being in private and/or fixed locations that offer a sense of refuge compared to public locations and/or when moving; the importance of collective effects perceived and experienced by a community; the importance of perceived spatial separation between a viewer and a windfarm (affecting sensitivity to <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> within open settings); and differences in how people judge the importance of horizontal <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> compared to vertical <b>scale</b> <b>effects.</b> The research findings contribute to the knowledge and understanding of people’s perception of <b>scale</b> and <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> in a landscape and they counter some common assumptions and current practice in landscape architecture. They can be applied in practice and policy to help assess <b>scale</b> <b>effects,</b> convey more clearly to people the type of <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> and how these will affect them, and minimise the adverse <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> of windfarms through siting and design. The thesis also identifies how to build upon these findings in the future, including recommendations for additional research, new approaches to assessment (including the use of prompt lists) and thresholds for acceptability of <b>scale</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
40|$|The main {{thrust of}} this paper is a {{critical}} assessment of the theory and evidence concerning the sources of <b>scale</b> <b>effects.</b> It is argued that the analysis of static <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> is important because <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> are embedding in our world and new technologies associated with an evolving economy often allow their exploitation when they cannot be exploited in less technically advanced and smaller economies. So, although static equilibrium theory is not a good vehicle for studying economic growth, showing how <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> operate when output varies with given technology helps us to understand the <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> that occur when output rises as a result of economic growth, even though that is typically driven by technological change. The set of production functions that are consistent with Viner’s treatment of long run cost curves are distinguished from the single production function that is found in virtually all modern microeconomic textbooks. It is argued that the inconsistencies and ambiguities relating to the use of such a single production function to cover all possible scales of a firm’s operations are such that it is an imperfect tool for analysing the <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> that firms actually face. The relation between <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> {{and the size of the}} firm are discussed. It is shown that under certain commonly occurring circumstances the ability to replicate production facilities is consistent with short ranges of diseconomies of scale and an indefinite range of increasing returns. Next comes a detailed analysis of the sources of positive <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> and a critical assessment of the treatment of these in a large sample of the existing literature. It is argued that the nature of our world, with its 3 -dimensions, its physical laws and the many random elements in its behaviour, is such that when the scale of anything changes, we should always expect to encounter non-linear <b>scale</b> <b>effects.</b> Most authors list a series of examples of sources that are assumed to give rise to <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> but seldom attempt to show in any detail how these are supposed to work. When we do this, some alleged sources are found not to give rise to <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> at all, while others have effects that differ from what has been assumed. Furthermore, there is seldom agreement among authors whether a particular source is a cause of varying returns to scale or economies of scale. Most authors argue that indivisibilities are an important source of <b>scale</b> <b>effects,</b> although these are seldom well defined, nor are the precise ways in which these are supposed to work typically analysed. When we do this, we identify two basic types of indivisibilities, ex post and ex ante, plus several variations of each of these main types. We then argue that the discussion of indivisibilities has been confused by use of different implicit definitions of the term and also that only one of these types of indivisibility can be a source of <b>scale</b> <b>effects.</b> Constant returns production functions are found to be inconsistent with much that is known about actual production techniques, even when firms expand by duplicating identical plants. Unless ruled out by definition, diseconomies of scale are found to be a real possibility in many circumstances. When these occur in some parts of complex capital goods or plants, they limit the extent to which economies in other parts can be exploited by increasing the scale of the whole operation. Finally, brief consideration is given to the literature concerning the factors that limit the exploitation of the <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> that are ubiquitous in the real world and to the consequences of their exploitation...|$|R

RCC (Roller Compacted Concrete), strengthened gabions) has increased the interest for stepped channels and spillways. However stepped chute hydraulics is not simple, because of different flow regimes and importantly because of very-strong interactions between entrained air and turbulence. In this study, new air-water flow measurements were conducted in two large-size stepped chute facilities with two step heights in each facility to study experimental distortion caused by <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> and the soundness of result extrapolation to prototypes. Experimental data included distributions of air concentration, air-water flow velocity, bubble frequency, bubble chord length and air-water flow turbulence intensity. For a Froude similitude, the results implied that <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> were observed in both facilities, although the geometric scaling ratio was only Lr= 2 in each case. The selection of the criterion for <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> is a critical issue. For example, major differences (i. e. <b>scale</b> <b>effects)</b> were observed in terms of bubble chord sizes and turbulence levels although little <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> were seen in terms of void fraction and velocity distributions. Overall the findings emphasize that physical modelling of stepped chutes based upon a Froude similitude is more sensitive to <b>scale</b> <b>effects</b> than classical smooth-invert chute studies, and this is consistent with basic dimensional analysis developed herein...|$|R
