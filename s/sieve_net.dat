40|$|The fishery for brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) in the North Sea {{is carried}} out by more than 600 vessels, with total annual brown shrimp {{landings}} of around 20, 000 t. Due to the small mesh size used, the catches also contain large amounts of unwanted by-catch. To find ways of reducing this by-catch, experiments were carried out during a one-year period with a <b>sieve</b> <b>net</b> rigged in a brown shrimp beam trawl. It was tested for its selective properties and an evaluation was made of its operational characteristics. The loss of commercial shrimp catch when using a <b>sieve</b> <b>net</b> was 15 % or less in favourable conditions. Certain components of the catch can. however, lead to a distortion of the outlet with a reduction of the commercial catch of over 30 %. It is likely that technical alterations to the outlet can prevent this. The <b>sieve</b> <b>net</b> showed very poor selective properties for commercial fish species with a length below 10 cm. Above 10 cm the selection improved with increasing length. Especially for Age 1 and older fish, this selective device serves its purpose. A significant reduction of non-commercial fish and invertebrates was also observed...|$|E
40|$|The Brown Shrimp (Crangon crangon L.) {{fishery in}} the North Sea, {{the focus of}} this study, is carried out with small meshed nets in {{vulnerable}} areas like coastal zones and estuaries. The discarding practices associated with it have been regarded as a problem for many years. The discussion, however, was difficult since no sufficiently reliable discard data were available. The need for data on this issue and a solution for the discard problem was the starting point of the study. The main objectives were to quantify the biological and economic consequences of discarding in the Brown Shrimp fishery and to evaluate possible technical alterations to the shrimp beam trawl to reduce discarding in this fishery. To fill the gap in knowledge on discarding practices in the North Sea Brown Shrimp fishery, a cooperative discard sampling programme was set up. In this study, absolute numbers of discards were produced. These were carefully examined in relation to other factors that determine the composition of a fish stock by using a newly designed biological and economic model. A next step in the project was a detailed study of the selectivity of the shrimp trawl. This was done for the sake of having a good description of the selective properties of the shrimp beam trawl and as a preparation for the experiments with selectivity improving devices. Three such devices were selected for study: 1) a selective sorting grid, 2) a selective <b>sieve</b> <b>net</b> and 3) electric pulses as an alternative stimulation. Although the selective grids have some clear advantages, like catch reduction of Age 1 + fish, non-commercial fish and invertebrates and better cod-end selectivity, they were found to be too susceptible to malfunction. The <b>sieve</b> <b>net</b> on the other hand, seemed to be a more acceptable device to fishermen with better selective properties. The basic idea in the application of electric pulses was to invoke selectively a startle response for shrimp with electric ticklers and to allow non-reacting species to escape underneath a raised groundrope. From the sea trials, it can be concluded that the electro-net gave satisfactory results. The losses of commercial shrimp were small or even non-existent. Part of the catch of undersized commercial fish species could escape and especially non-commercial fish and invertebrates were caught in lower numbers compared to the standard net. New technical measures were established in 2002 and included, for Belgium, the enforcement of the use of sieve nets in the Brown Shrimp fishery. Without doubt, these measures will reduce the impact that shrimp fishing has on the fish stocks and on the ecosystem as a whole. Nevertheless, where fishing occurs, impact on the ecosystem is inevitable. The Sea Fisheries Department has the intention to continue to strive towards more environmental friendly fishing...|$|E
40|$|At {{present the}} fishery for the brown shrimp (Crangon crangon L.) {{is one of}} the most {{economically}} rewarding fisheries in Europe. Due to the small size of the target objects this fishery has to be carried out with rather small meshes. As it is, however, performed on the nursing grounds of important fish species it encounters a severe bycatch problem. On this basis, EU Council regulation 850 / 98 demands the use of either <b>sieve</b> <b>nets</b> or sorting grids from 1 July, and to pass pertaining national bye-laws.

40|$|Fish {{cage culture}} is a rapid aquacultural {{practice}} of producing fish with more yield compared to traditional pond culture. Several species cultured by this method include Cyprinus carpio, Orechromis niloticus, Sarotherodon galilaeus, Tilapia zilli, Clarias lazera, C. gariepinus, Heterobranchus bidorsalis, Citharinus citharus, Distochodus rostratus and Alestes dentes. However, the culture of fish in cages has some problems that are due to mechanical defects of the cage or diseases due to infection. The mechanical problems which may lead to clogged net, toxicity and easy access by predators depend on defects associated with various types of nets which include fold <b>sieve</b> cloth <b>net,</b> wire net, polypropylene net, nylon, galvanized and welded net. The diseases problems are of two types namely introduced diseases due to parasites. The introduced parasites include Crustaseans, Ergasilus sp.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify whether taxonomic and {{functional}} composition of stream fishes vary under three different preservation conditions of riparian zone: preserved (PRE), intermediate condition (INT), and degraded (DEG). Five stream stretches representing each condition were selected. Samples were taken from each stream in three occasions during the dry seasons from 2004 to 2007. Electro fishing (PRE and INT), <b>sieves,</b> dip <b>nets,</b> and hand seines (DEG) were used according to the characteristics of each sampled site. Overall, 46 species were registered. Differences in the taxonomic and functional species composition among groups were found, following the condition of riparian zones. The ichthyofauna recorded in the PRE was typical to pristine environments, consisting of species with specialized habits, notably benthic insectivores, intolerant, and rheophilics. In the INT group, replacement of riparian forest with shrubs and/or grasses created environmental conditions which favor the occurrence of tolerant species but also harbor a residual fauna of sensitive species. DEG streams presented mostly detritivores, tolerant, small sized fishes which occupy the surface and preferred slow water flux. Changes in the species composition were represented by the occurrence and dominance of tolerant species in detriment of the more sensitive and specialist species, following the gradient of degradation in the riparian zone. Forested streams act as unique habitats to many specialized species and it can be presumable that the degradation of riparian vegetation can generate biotic homogenization which may reduce species diversity and ecosystem services...|$|R
40|$|The {{water channel}} aquaporin- 1 (AQP 1) is the {{molecular}} counterpart of the ultrasmall pore responsible for transcellular water permeability during peritoneal dialysis (PD). This water permeability accounts {{for up to}} 50 % of ultrafiltration (UF) during a hypertonic dwell, and its loss can be a major clinical problem for PD patients. By analogy with the lung, the hypothesis was tested that corticosteroids may increase AQP 1 expression in the peritoneal membrane (PM) and improve water permeability and UF in rats. First, the expression and distribution of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the PM and capillary endothelium was documented. Time-course and dose-response analyses showed that a daily IM injection of dexamethasone (1 or 4 mg/kg) for 5 d induced an approximately twofold increase in the expression of AQP 1 at the mRNA and protein levels. The GR antagonist RU- 486 completely inhibited the dexamethasone effect. The functional counterpart of the increased AQP 1 expression was {{a significant increase in}} sodium <b>sieving</b> and <b>net</b> UF across the PM, contrasting with a lack of effect on the osmotic gradient and permeability for small solutes. The latter observation reflected the lack of effect of corticosteroids on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and endothelial NOS isoform expression in the PM. In conclusion, corticosteroids induce AQP 1 expression in the capillary endothelium of the PM, which is reflected by increased transcellular water permeability and UF. These data emphasize the critical role of AQP 1 during PD and suggest that pharmacologic regulation of AQP 1 may provide a target for manipulating water permeability across the PM...|$|R

40|$|Membrane channel {{clogging}} in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) {{has been}} largely unexplored by the research community, despite it being widely recognised as the main impediment to sustainable MBR operation by practitioners, and reflects the difficulty of examining clogging with the same scientific rigour as membrane fouling. The incidence of clogging/“ragging” has been assessed across 10 – 12 full-scale flat sheet immersed MBRs, equipped with inlet screens of similar rating, and physical characteristics of the sludge examined. Measured sludge quality determinants included classical {{mixed liquor suspended solids}} (MLSS) concentration and filterability measurement, as well as a series of novel sludge characterisations based on determination of coarse suspended solids (CSS) concentration using <b>sieves</b> or <b>nets</b> of aperture sizes between 150 and 4000 μm. A further rudimentary test was conducted on the coarse filtered solids to assess the mechanical integrity of the agglomerated material. Results showed there to be a reasonable correlation between filterability and concentration of super- 4 mm particles, whereas no such correlation existed between filterability and MLSS. This indicated the nature of the solids, and particularly the highly coarse particulate content, to be critical in determining filtration resistance. Both filterability and CSS concentration also correlated with heuristically assessed clogging propensity, with those plants fitted with screenings maceration being more prone to clogging than those with more conventional screenings treatment where screenings were removed entirely. The coarse suspended solids were found to readily agglomerate to form characteristic “rags”, i. e. 10 – 15 cm-long braids of aggregated material, which were self-supporting when suspended in air. The mechanical integrity of these fibres was unaffected by chemical treatment either with detergent or hypochlorite, indicating a degree of robustness of the rags which were formed primarily of cellulosic matter. Identical properties were recorded from experiments conducted on cotton wool filaments, suggesting ragging to relate to disposal of cotton wool-based prod...|$|R

40|$|Pharmacologic {{studies suggest}} that the release of nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) {{contributes}} to functional alterations of the peritoneal membrane (PM) induced by acute peritonitis. In this study, peritoneal permeability parameters in a mouse model of peritoneal dialysis were characterized, and the effects of eNOS deletion on the PM structure and permeability at baseline and after catheter-induced bacterial peritonitis were examined. Exposure of C 57 BL/ 6 mice to standard dialysate yielded a transport of urea and glucose, a sodium <b>sieving,</b> and a <b>net</b> ultrafiltration that were remarkably similar to the values obtained in rats. In comparison with controls, mice with catheter-induced peritonitis were characterized by structural changes in the PM (mononuclear cells infiltrate, vascular proliferation), upregulation of endothelial and inducible NOS, increased permeability for urea and glucose, decreased ultrafiltration, and increased protein loss in the dialysate. Comparison of eNOS wild-type and knockout mice revealed that the permeability modifications and structural changes induced by acute peritonitis were significantly reversed in eNOS knockout mice, resulting in a net increase in ultrafiltration. In contrast, the deletion of eNOS in mouse peritoneum was not reflected by permeability modifications or structural changes at baseline. These results are the first {{to take advantage of a}} knockout mouse model to demonstrate directly the crucial importance of eNOS in the permeability and structural modifications caused by acute peritonitis. The characterization of this mouse model suggests that genetically modified mice represent useful tools to investigate the molecular bases of the peritoneal changes during peritoneal dialysis...|$|R

40|$|During storm events, {{the flow}} in a {{combined}} sewer system can exceed the capacity and, as a result, a combined sewer overflow (CSO) will occur. During a CSO raw wastewater is discharged to surface water. This wastewater {{is a mixture of}} raw sanitary wastewater, raw industrial wastewater and rainwater. The receiving water will get polluted by dissolved as well as undissolved pollutants. Therefore a CSO can cause damage to the ecological and biological state of the receiving water and besides it can cause public health risks. Until now the problem, with respect to CSOs in the Netherlands, is dominated by a quantitative approach. CSO flow rates and frequencies were in the past decades the main subject of research. These frequencies were translated into the Wet Verontreiniging Oppervlaktewater (1970). In the year 1998 the Ministry of Transport and Water Management came with a renewed policy, the fourth Memorandum on Water Management, dealing with groundwater, dehydration and water quality, for the protection and the recovery of nature. At the end of 2000 the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) came into force, which charges the European members of the EU to report obligatory. The aim of the WFD is to have an ecological and biological balance for all surface waters and groundwater in Europe effectively working in 2015. Measures are required to push back the pollution by defined dangerous substances. Measures with regard to the reduction of CSO frequencies alone is not enough to fulfil the legislation. When a CSO occurs an amount of pollutants will enter the surface water. CSO water needs to be treated to prevent pollution and odour annoyances to the surroundings. The goal of this research is to find a suitable treatment technique or a combination of treatment techniques. Primary and secondary techniques, adsorption and disinfection techniques are described. Primary techniques remove suspended solids and a fraction of the organic material, secondary techniques remove suspended solids and biological degradable material. Adsorption techniques are used to remove for example endocrine disrupting substances and disinfection techniques are used to minimize health risks for the population. In the Netherlands CSOs occur five to ten times a year per location. Therefore a treatment technique {{needs to be able to}} start up in a few minutes even after a long period without feedwater and should be able to handle wide and quick variations in flow without causing any inconveniences to the surroundings. Primary techniques like <b>sieving,</b> the <b>Netting</b> TrashTrapTM system and sedimentation basins and secondary techniques like membrane filtration, sand filtration and synthetic medium filtration are described.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Animal {{models are}} {{important}} for understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of peritoneal transport during peritoneal dialysis (PD). Mechanistic investigations of rat and rabbit models of PD are mostly based on intervention studies using pharmacologic agents or blocking antibodies. These models may be limited by the time-course, lack of specificity, or side effects of such interventions. Genetically modified mice could provide an attractive alternative to the above models. In this study, we have characterized PD parameters and tested the effect of gender and dialysate volume and/or osmolality in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse. METHODS: Mice were submitted to a 2 -hour peritoneal equilibration test {{in order to obtain}} permeability parameters. The expression of the water channel aquaporin- 1 (AQP 1) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) was investigated at the protein (immunoblotting, immunostaining) and mRNA [real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) ] levels. The potential effect of gender on these parameters was also studied. RESULTS: Exposure of mice to 2 mL of 3. 86 % glucose dialysate yielded equilibration curves for urea and glucose, a sodium <b>sieving,</b> and a <b>net</b> ultrafiltration (UF) that were remarkably similar to those obtained in rats. The increase in dialysate volume (from 2 mL to 3 mL and 6 mL) resulted in a higher ultrafiltration and, for the highest volume, an increase in the diffusive mass transport coefficient (MTAC) for urea. The increase in dialysate glucose concentration (from 1. 36 % to 3. 86 % and 7 %) resulted in increased sodium sieving and higher UF, whereas the MTAC for urea was unchanged. In comparison with males, females had a similar peritoneal transport rate for small solutes but a significantly lower sodium sieving, reflecting a lower AQP 1 mRNA and protein expression in the peritoneum. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the structural and functional similarity between mouse and rat models of PD, and further emphasize the relevance of mouse models to understand PD in humans.

Os resultados mostraram que a microbacia encontra-se ainda bem preservada, mas que investimentos na sua manutenção e recuperação são necessários. Streams {{and rivers}} are loctic environments characterized {{for a strong}} and unidirectional water flow. These environments in general have the light incidence partial or totally obstructed by the canopy of the riparian vegetation showing a high dependence of allocthonus organic inputs. The stream fishes are usually small sized, with reproductive strategies adapted to the unstable environment and have great trophic plasticity. The endemism is very common in this ictiofauna. The studies on trophic ecology and resources partitioning are important for {{the understanding of the}} community dynamics in the environment and the maintenance of the species. The Lapa Stream Watershed is located in the central region of the São Paulo State on area of basaltic cuesta relief. The surroundings of these streams are relatively well preserved and the main economic activities of the region are farming and ecotourism. This study was performed throughout four seasonal fish collections, carried out between April of 2002 and February of 2003 in the diurnal and nocturnal periods. Twelve collection stations were distributed in Lapa and Cantagalo Streams and in Passa Cinco River and sampling were made using cast <b>nets,</b> baited traps, <b>sieves,</b> and gill <b>nets.</b> The diet of 29 species were studied and it was found that insetivory was the main alimentary habit, followed by iliophagy - algivory and omnivory. The alimentary overlapping was high in several species pairs, but the habitat segregation occurred in some of them. The diet of three species altered along the upstream downstream gradient. The patterns of simpatry had been analyzed in three genera: Bryconamericus, Apareiodon and Astyanax and the food was the main resource partitioned among these species followed by the space resource. The results had shown that the micro basin is still well preserved, but that investments in the maintenance and recovery are necessary...|$|R
