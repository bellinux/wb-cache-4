A diversity scheme is typically required when using frequencies in the Ka, V, or W-band. The downlink transmissions of satellites cover very large areas, that will have different weather. The <b>site</b> <b>diversity</b> technique consists of linking two or more ground stations receiving the same signal: this way, if the signal is heavily attenuated in one area, another ground stations can compensate it. These intense rain areas, for example, supercells, often have a horizontal length {{of no more than}} a few kilometers: putting the ground stations at a sufficient distance the possibility of rain fade in the downlink signal will be reduced.|$|E

5000|$|Space diversity: The {{signal is}} {{transmitted}} over several different propagation paths. In {{the case of}} wired transmission, this {{can be achieved by}} transmitting via multiple wires. In the case of wireless transmission, it can be achieved by antenna diversity using multiple transmitter antennas (transmit diversity) and/or multiple receiving antennas (reception diversity). In the latter case, a diversity combining technique is applied before further signal processing takes place. If the antennas are far apart, for example at different cellular base station sites or WLAN access points, this is called macrodiversity or <b>site</b> <b>diversity.</b> If the antennas are at a distance in the order of one wavelength, this is called microdiversity. A special case is phased antenna arrays, which also can be used for beamforming, MIMO channels and space-time coding (STC).|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{combination}} of multiple antennas and multicarrier code {{division multiple access}} (MC-CDMA) is a strong candidate for the downlink of future mobile communications. The study of such systems, in scenarios that model real life transmissions is an additional step towards an optimised achievement. Nevertheless, when transmitting over fading channel multi-cell interference occurs and this degrades the performance of the system. <b>Site</b> <b>diversity</b> technique is applied to the system to overcome multi-cell interference. Due to non orthogonality of spreading codes multi-cell interference is not completely eradicated. To overcome this problem, spreading codes are assigned to each base station.
