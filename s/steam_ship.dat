5|$|A road up Stjørdalen {{was built}} during the 1850s, {{connecting}} at Stjørdalshalsen to a <b>steam</b> <b>ship</b> service to Trondheim. A concern in Sweden was that Bottenviken could freeze {{up and that}} the Trondheimsfjord offered an ice-free alternative for export of timber.|$|E
5|$|Havana was {{launched}} in 1906 by William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia for the New York & Cuba Mail <b>Steam</b> <b>Ship</b> Co. — {{commonly referred to as}} the Ward Line — as a passenger steamer on the New York to Havana route.|$|E
5|$|All the {{stations}} {{along the line}} were designed by Paul Armin Due, with all but the terminal station built in wood. Flekkefjord Station was built as a three-story brick building in Art Nouveau. In addition, there was construction a depot and a wharf at Flekkefjord. Passengers could transfer to <b>steam</b> <b>ship</b> services that operated eastwards along the south coast towards Oslo.|$|E

50|$|As Dahlström's {{businesses}} {{relied on}} sea transport, he invested on shipping. The local pioneer in <b>steam</b> <b>shipping,</b> Åbo ångfartygsbolag ("Turku <b>Steam</b> <b>Shipping</b> Company"), bankrupted in 1849, {{after which the}} company was re-established under name Åbo nya ångfartygsbolag ("Turku New <b>Steam</b> <b>Shipping</b> Company"), in which Dahlström was a shareholder. In 1856 he founded Aura Ångfartygsbolag, which operated new steamship Aura; the ship travelled from Turku to Stockholm in 14 hours. The company was merged to the New Steamship Company in 1861. By the 1860s Dahlström {{was one of the}} most significant shipowners of Turku.|$|R

5|$|Initially, {{there were}} four trains daily in each direction, reduced to three on holidays. The most {{important}} train {{was the one that}} coordinated with the west-bound steam ship; the train would wait up to 45 minutes if the ship was delayed. This become the dominant route for people to get from Stavanger to cities along the South Coast, as well as to Oslo. In addition to passengers, major cargo shipments included seasonal shipments of herring, as well as lumber from the surrounding areas. Coal for the trains was imported by <b>steam</b> <b>ship</b> to Flekkefjord.|$|E
5|$|Specialized bulk {{carriers}} {{began to appear}} as steam-powered ships became more popular. The first <b>steam</b> <b>ship</b> recognized as a bulk carrier was the British coal carrier SS John Bowes in 1852. She featured a metal hull, a steam engine, and a ballasting system which used seawater instead of sandbags. These features helped her succeed in the competitive British coal market. The first self-unloader was the lake freighter Hennepin in 1902 on the Great Lakes. This greatly decreased the unloading time of bulkers by using conveyor belt to move the cargo. The first bulkers with diesel propulsion {{began to appear in}} 1911.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Green Atlas Shipping and its insurer, Britannia <b>Steam</b> <b>Ship</b> Insurance Association, {{sued the}} United States for US$96million, {{claiming}} negligence {{on the part}} of the Coast Guard due to faulty nautical charts. They also alleged failure {{on the part of}} the local bar pilots to advise the ship's crew not to anchor in the area, and that dredging by the United States Army Corps of Engineers had exacerbated the problems with the anchor. The U.S. countersued for US$7million in damages. In 2004, the two sides reached an agreement in which Green Atlas would pay the U.S. US$10.5million to assist with cleanup costs, and the U.S. paid Green Atlas US$4million in settlement of the faulty charts claim. The net result of the settlement was payment of US$6.5million to the U.S. Although this was far less than the damages claimed by the U.S. for environmental cleanup and restoration costs, government officials still saw the settlement as a victory since the shipping company was forced to pay for part of the damage. Some Coos County officials were dissatisfied with the settlement, however, stating that it should have instead been paid to local business owners who were negatively impacted by the closure of the beach.|$|E

5|$|The {{meeting on}} 17 January was crowded. Many {{attendees}} were not electors, as franchise {{was attached to}} land ownership in excess of £50, or yearly rental over £10, and the resulting roll was only about 160 names long, including absentee owners in England. There had been rumours beforehand that somebody would come forward to oppose Sewell. William Thomson was elected to chair the meeting. Sewell spoke at length about various issues: {{that he should be}} elected because of the service that he had given Canterbury as their representative when in financial crisis, that he even delayed his departure to England to resolve the issues, that he had no conflict of interest with the <b>steam</b> <b>ship</b> company that provided New Zealand's postal service with England, {{that he did not have}} land holdings in the North Island more valuable than holdings in Canterbury, that he gave qualified support to the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel project and he gave his reasons for leaving the Stafford Ministry so soon after his return to the colony last year. He disagreed with Stafford's government on some issues. The two most important disagreements were land policy, where Sewell wanted the land revenue to be retained by the provincial governments, rather than the southern provinces pay a high proportion of their revenue to enable purchase of land in the north, and native policy, where Sewell predicted that the land policy being pursued would result in strong conflict with Māori; in fact, the First Taranaki War started in March 1860. As a solution, Sewell suggested the possible separation of the North Island and the South Island into separate countries; this was the first time, as far as the editor of the Lyttelton Times was aware, that such a suggestion had been made in public by a politician. The politician who is today known to have favoured separation is Julius Vogel, and he started campaigning for this idea in 1862. The Lyttelton Times argued, against the objection of many, that such an idea had merit for further consideration.|$|E
