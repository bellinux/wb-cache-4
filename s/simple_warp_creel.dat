40|$|Active {{appearance}} models (AAMs) {{have demonstrated}} great utility when being employed for non-rigid face alignment/tracking. The “simultaneous ” algorithm for fitting an AAM achieves good non-rigid face registration performance, but has poor real time performance (2 - 3 fps). The “project-out ” algorithm for fitting an AAM achieves faster than real time performance (> 200 fps) but su↵ers from poor generic alignment performance. In this paper we introduce an extension to a discriminative method for non-rigid face registration/tracking {{referred to as}} a constrained local model (CLM). Our proposed method is able to achieve superior performance to the “simultaneous ” AAM algorithm along with real time fitting speeds (35 fps). We improve upon the canonical CLM formulation, to gain this performance, {{in a number of ways}} by employing: (i) linear SVMs as patch-experts, (ii) a simplified optimization criteria, and (iii) a composite rather than additive warp update step. Most notably, our simplified optimization criteria for fitting the CLM divides the problem of finding a single complex registration/warp displacement into that of finding N <b>simple</b> <b>warp</b> displacements. From these N <b>simple</b> <b>warp</b> displacements, a single complex warp displacement is estimated using a weighted least-squares constraint. Another major advantage of this simplified optimization lends from its ability to be parallelized, a step which we also theoretically explore in this paper. We refer to our approach for fitting the CLM as the “exhaustive local search ” (ELS) algorithm. Experiments were conducted on the CMU Multi-PIE database...|$|R

40|$|Renormalisation group {{flows of}} the bosonic {{nonlinear}} σ-model are governed, perturbatively, at different orders of α', by the perturbatively evaluated β [...] functions. In regions where α'/R_c^ 2 << 1 the flow equations at various orders in α' {{can be thought}} of as approximating the full, non-perturbative RG flow. On the other hand, taking a different viewpoint, we may consider the abovementioned RG flow equations as viable geometric flows in their own right and without any reference to the RG aspect. Looked at as purely geometric flows where higher order terms appear, we no longer have the perturbative restrictions. In this paper, we perform our analysis from both these perspectives using specific target manifolds such as S^ 2, H^ 2, unwarped S^ 2 x H^ 2 and <b>simple</b> <b>warped</b> products. We analyze and solve the higher order RG flow equations within the appropriate perturbative domains and find the corrections arising due to the inclusion of higher order terms. Such corrections, within the perturbative regime, are shown to be small and they provide an estimate of the error which arises when higher orders are ignored. We also investigate the higher order geometric flows on the same manifolds and figure out generic features of geometric evolution, the appearance of singularities and solitons. The aim, in this context, is to demonstrate the role of the higher order terms in modifying the flow. One interesting aspect of our analysis is that, separable solutions of the higher order flow equations for <b>simple</b> <b>warped</b> spacetimes, correspond to constant curvature Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, modulo an overall flow [...] parameter dependent scale factor. The functional form of this scale factor (which we obtain) changes on the inclusion of successive higher order terms in the flow. Comment: 25 pages, 40 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an algorithm-based low-power VLSI architecture for video object (VO) motion tracking. The new architecture uses a novel hierarchical adaptive structured mesh topology. The structured mesh offers {{a significant reduction}} in the number of bits that describe the mesh topology. The motion of the mesh nodes represents the deformation of the VO. The motion com-pensation is performed using a multiplication-free algorithm for affine transformation, which significantly reduces the complexity of the decoder architecture. Moreover, pipelining the affine unit contributes a considerable savings of power. The VO motion-tracking architecture is based on a new algorithm for tracking a VO. It consists of two main parts: a video object motion-estimation unit (VOME) and a video object motion-compensation unit (VOMC). The VOME processes two consequent frames to generate a hierarchical adaptive structured mesh and the motion vectors of the mesh nodes. It implements parallel block matching motion-estimation units to optimize the latency. The VOMC processes a reference frame, mesh nodes, and motion vectors to predict a video frame. It implements parallel threads in which each thread implements a pipelined chain of scalable affine units. This motion-compensation algorithm allows the use of one <b>simple</b> <b>warping</b> unit to map a hierarchical structure. The affine unit warps the texture of a patch at any level of hierarchical mesh independently. The processor uses a memory serialization unit, which interfaces the memory to the parallel units. The architecture has been prototyped using top-down low-power design methodology. The performance analysis shows that this pro-cessor can be used in online object-based video applications such as in MPEG- 4 and VRML.

The optimization selects the most suitable frames in the input video for generating the stereoscopic video frames.

40|$|We map {{the stellar}} {{structure}} of the Galactic thick disk and halo by applying color-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting to photometric data from the SEGUE survey, allowing, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of their structure at both high and low latitudes using uniform SDSS photometry. Incorporating photometry of all relevant stars simultaneously, CMD fitting bypasses the need to choose single tracer populations. Using old stellar populations of differing metallicities as templates we obtain a sparse 3 D map of the stellar mass distribution at |Z|> 1 kpc. Fitting a smooth Milky Way model comprising exponential thin and thick disks and an axisymmetric power-law halo allows us to constrain the structural parameters of the thick disk and halo. The thick-disk scale height and length are well constrained at 0. 75 +- 0. 07 kpc and 4. 1 +- 0. 4 kpc, respectively. We find a stellar halo flattening within ~ 25 kpc of c/a= 0. 88 +- 0. 03 and a power-law index of 2. 75 +- 0. 07 (for 7 <R_{GC}<~ 30 kpc). The model fits yield thick-disk and stellar halo densities at the solar location of rho_{thick,sun}= 10 ^{- 2. 3 +- 0. 1 } M_sun pc^{- 3 } and rho_{halo,sun}= 10 ^{- 4. 20 +- 0. 05 } M_sun pc^{- 3 }, averaging over any substructures. Our analysis provides the first clear in situ evidence for a radial metallicity gradient in the Milky Way's stellar halo: within R<~ 15 kpc the stellar halo has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]=- 1. 6, which shifts to [Fe/H]=- 2. 2 at larger radii.

40|$|Since 1986, I {{have been}} {{pursuing}} my passionate interest in handwoven velvet, both practically and academically. By velvet, I mean extra-warp pile, rather than weft-woven types of pile, such as weft-looping or knotting. Simple, monochrome plain velvets have been woven {{since the early}} Coptic period, requiring only simple looms and two <b>simple</b> <b>warp</b> tensioning systems, one for the foundation cloth and another for the pile warp. 1 (On the basis of such a simple set-up, early velvet figuration could be created through the following colour effects using: (a) striped pile warp; (b) ikat/chiné (spaced dyed) pile warp; (c) painted or printed pile warp; (d) 2 striped warps mounted counterchange style (e. g. DLDLDL/LDLDLD); or (e) 2 contrasting warps, motifs picked up by hand or held {{on a set of}} half-heddle rods. Simple textural effects include: (a) alternating stripes or bands of velvet (cut and/or uncut) and flat cloth; and (b) bands of differing heights of pile (cut or uncut). All of the above variations can be created using simple looms with as few as three or four shafts. 2 For example, the elaborate figuration of Uzbeki velvet ikats is provided by the ikat dyed patterning of the pile warp, which is then woven as a “solid” velvet, whose pile uniformly covers the whole fabric surface. 3 This velvet can be woven on a 4 shaft counter-balanced loom with both foundation warp and pile warp separately tensioned with “live” or gravity weighting provided by bags of bricks. Solid velvet pile warps can also be mounted on a single warp beam with uniform tension because all the pile warps are taken up identically. Examples of chequered patterning in silk velvets date back at least to the 11 th century. 4 Simple counterchange chequered designs can be woven with a minimum of two pile shafts and two pile warps, one of each of two contrasting colours. The two contrasting colours, let us say L 2 ̆ 6 D, can also be wound together as a pair and mounted as a single pile warp in which the two colours alternate. A 4 -shaft loom is sufficient for such patterns. To create the chequered pattern, the pile shafts 3 and 4 are ordered in blocks as follows: 3 rd shaft – LDLDLD… DLDLDL… 4 th shaft – DLDLDL… LDLDLD… Although the loom mounting for a chequered velvet is simple, the alternation of colours, although likely balanced over the whole piece, requires a separate tension for the ends on each of the two pile shafts. This is best facilitated by weighting the ends of each pile shaft separately on uniformly tensioned warp beams or with live weights. Without separate tension, a recurring build-up of slack pile ends will interfere with smooth weaving and an even pile height...|$|R

Here we show results from novel behavioural methods and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) demonstrating that biases in size perception are correlated with the spatial tuning of neuronal populations in healthy volunteers. To explain this relationship, we formulate a population read-out model that directly links the spatial distribution of V 1 representations to our perceptual experience of visual size.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{advanced}} {{signal processing}} concepts and their application to geometric processing and transformations {{of images and}} volumes. In the first part, we discuss the class of transformations that project volume data onto a plane using parallel line integrals; {{it is called the}} X-ray transform. In computer tomography (CT) the problem is to reconstruct the volume from these projections. We consider a basic setup with parallel projection and a geometry model in which the CT scanner rotates around one main axis of the volume. In this case, the problem is separable and reduces to the reconstruction of parallel images (slices of the volume). Each image is reconstructible from a series of 1 D projections taken at different angular positions. The standard reconstruction algorithm is the filtered back-projection (FBP). We propose an alternative discretization of the Radon transform and of its inverse that is based on least-squares approximation and the convolution of splines. It improves the quality of the transform significantly. Next we discuss volume rendering based on the X-ray transform. The volume is represented by a multiresolution wavelet decomposition. The wavelets are projected onto an adaptive multiresolution 2 D grid. The multiresolution grid allows to speed up the rendering process especially at coarse scales. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, we discuss transformations that warp images. In computer graphics, this is called texture mapping. <b>Simple</b> <b>warps,</b> such as shear, rotation, or zoom, can be computed by least-squares sampling, e. g. again with convolutions of splines. For more general warps there is not an easy continuous solution, if an analytical one exists at all. After a review of existing texture mapping methods, we propose a novel recursive one, which minimizes information loss. For this purpose, the texture is reconstructed from the mapped image and compared to the original texture. This algorithm outperforms the existing methods in terms of quality, but its complexity can be very high. A multiresolution version of the algorithm allows to keep the storage requirements and computational complexity within acceptable range. Fast transmission of textures and 3 D models over communication links requires low bitrate and progressive compression. We can achieve very low bitrate if we code textures only with the information necessary for a given view of the 3 D scene. If the view changes, the missing information will be transmitted. This results in a progressive bitstream for an animated 3 D scene. In contrast to recursive texture mapping, we do not back-project the texture, but come up with a heuristic that predicts the information loss. This concept is called view-dependent scalability and we show how to apply it on DCT-based (as part of MPEG- 4) and wavelet-based coders. Last, we inspect the question of how to balance the bit budget of a jointly coded mesh and texture for the progressive and view-dependent transmission of a 3 D model. By exhaustive search, we find the rate-distortion optimal path. By marginal analysis we find a close solution but at much lower costs (only two evaluated frames per step as compared to a full search) ...|$|R

GPGPUs mainlyrely on the hardware multithreading to hide a short pipeline stall and a long memory latency. Thus, the performance of GPGPU can be signicantly aected by how GPGPU'shardware multithreading is applied. However, nding the optimal hardware multithreadingis a complex problem since there are many aspects to be considered. This work studies themechanisms for improving the eectiveness of hardware multithreading. First, it studiesthe various scheduling policies and proposes an adaptive scheduling policy that chooses thebest scheduling policy at runtime. In addition, it proposes <b>simple</b> but eective <b>warp</b> throttlingmechanism that can increase the cache locality. Furthermore, it proposes a hardwareprefetching mechanism to extend the memory latency hiding degree of hardware multithreading. Finally, it shows how a limited scalability of the conventional cache miss handling architectureconstrains the degree of hardware multithreading and proposes the highly scalablecache miss handling architecture...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Several {{studies suggest}} that the {{image-based}} approach to object recognition can be extended to basic level recognition, {{but it is not clear}} yet how basic level recognition is achieved. It seems that the shapes of category members on the basic level can be aligned by rather <b>simple</b> topological (<b>warping)</b> transformations — for most biological and many artifact categories. This study was motivated by the hypothesis that basic level recognition involves analog topological transformation processes — in order to achieve an alignment of stimulus representation and object representation. Two research questions were investigated: (1) Does categorization performance depend on the amount of topological transformation? (2) If systematic effects can be detected, are these effects caused by analog transformation processes? Methods: Images from 16 biological and 14 artifact categories were scanned. On the basis of two members of a category, with morphing software new exemplars were produced as intermediate morphs at specific transformational distances. In every trial two backward masked images were presented sequentially (sequential matching task). The transformational distance between the two images was varied. Subjects had to decide by key press whether both images belonged to the same basic level category or not. Results: The predictions were confirmed by the data: Both RTs and error rates increased with increasing amount of topological transformation between two objects of the same category. Furthermore, RTs are sequentially additive, which is evidence that the topological transformation traverses intermediate points in the transformational path. Conclusions: Taken together, the data indicate that basic level recognition relies on time-consuming and error-prone topological transformation processes, which have an analog nature. The results support a model of basic level recognition that is based on analog (image-like) representations and analog transformation processes...|$|R
40|$|Estimating {{an overall}} density {{function}} from repeated observations {{on each of}} a sample of independent subjects or experimental units is of interest. An example is provided by biodemographic studies, where one observes age-at-death for several cohorts of flies. Cohorts are kept in separate cages, which form the experimental units. Time variation then is likely to exist between the cohort densities and hazard rates due to cage effects on aging. Given the densities of age-at-death for the individual cohorts, one aims to obtain an estimate for the underlying overall density and hazard rate. In microarray gene expression experiments, similar problems arise when addressing the need for normalization of probe-level data from different arrays. Conventional methods, such as the cross-sectional average density, ignore time variation and hence are often not representative for such data. We view densities as functional data and model individual densities as warped versions of an underlying overall density, where the observed densities {{are assumed to be}} realizations of an underlying stochastic process. Quantile-synchronized distribution functions are obtained from an inverse warping mapping, based on quantile synchronization, leading to quantile-synchronized density and hazard functions. Kernel type smoothing methods with plug-in bandwidth selection can be used for estimating the components of the model. Asymptotic properties of the synchronized density estimates are derived. Simulation results show that functional density synchronization is often advantageous when compared to conventional density averaging or <b>simple</b> time-shift <b>warping.</b> Our approach complements previous quantile normalization methods used for microarray expression data and is illustrated with both longevity data obtained for 54 cohorts of mexflies (Mexican fruit flies) and gene expression data of the Ts 1 Cje mouse study for Down syndrome.

40|$|Speech recognizers {{provide good}} {{performance}} for most users but the error rate often increases dramatically {{for a small}} percentage of talkers who are "different " from those talkers used for training. One expensive solution to this problem is to gather more training data in an attempt to sample these outlier users. A second solution, explored in this paper, is to artificially enlarge the number of training talkers by transforming the speech of existing training talkers. This approach is similar to enlarging the training set for OCR digit recognition by warping the training digit images, but is more difficult because continuous speech has a much larger number of dimensions (e. g. linguistic, phonetic, style, temporal, spectral) that differ across talkers. We explored the use of <b>simple</b> linear spectral <b>warping</b> to enlarge a 48 -talker training data base used for word spotting. The average detection rate overall was increased by 2. 9 percentage points (from 68. 3 % to 71. 2 %) for male speakers and 2. 5 percentage points (from 64. 8 % to 67. 3 %) for female speakers. This increase is small but similar to that obtained by doubling the amount of training data. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known Neolithic textile {{production in}} the Old World {{is supported by a}} 2013 find of a piece of cloth woven from hemp, in burial F. 7121 at the Çatalhöyük site suggested to be from around 7000 B.C. Further finds come from the advanced civilisation preserved in the pile dwellings in Switzerland. Another extant fragment from the Neolithic was found in Fayum, at a site dated to about 5000 BCE. This fragment is woven at about 12 threads by 9 threads per cm in a plain weave. Flax was the predominant fibre in Egypt at this time (3600 BCE) and continued popularity in the Nile Valley, though wool became the primary fibre used in other cultures around 2000 BCE. Weaving was known in all the great civilisations, but no clear line of causality has been established. Early looms required two people to create the shed and one person to pass through the filling. Early looms wove a fixed length of cloth, but later ones allowed warp to be wound out as the fell progressed. The weavers were often children or slaves. Weaving became <b>simpler</b> when the <b>warp</b> was sized.|$|R
