5|$|In 1904, the Met {{opened a}} 10.5MW {{coal-fired}} power station at Neasden, which supplied 11kV 33.3Hz current to five <b>substations</b> that converted this to 600VDC using rotary converters.|$|E
5|$|The tower's {{electrical}} service was supplied by Consolidated Edison (ConEd) at 13,800volts. The electricity {{passed through the}} World Trade Center Primary Distribution Center (PDC), and was then sent up the building's core to electrical <b>substations</b> located on the mechanical floors. The <b>substations</b> lowered the 13,800 primary voltage to 480/277volts, and the voltage was then further lowered to 208/120volts for general power and lighting services. The complex was also served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and {{on the roof of}} Five World Trade Center.|$|E

30|$|The six {{experimental}} projects completed by State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) {{had been put}} into operation {{at the end of}} 2013, and the local area protections and the <b>substation</b> area protection, as well as control equipment were used in following substations: 220 kV Dashiqiao <b>Substation</b> in Chongqing, 220 kV Future City <b>Substation</b> in Beijing, 110 kV Future City <b>Substation</b> in Wuhan, 110 kV Yetang <b>Substation</b> in Shanghai, 110 kV High & New Technological Park <b>Substation</b> in Tianjin, and 110 kV Haijingluo <b>Substation</b> in Beijing.|$|R
5|$|The James Bay {{hydroelectric}} dam complex contains several {{relatively short}} 735kV power lines that send electricity to three principal <b>substations,</b> ordered from west to east: Radisson, Chissibi, and Lemoyne. From these <b>substations,</b> six 735kV power lines traverse the vast expanses of taiga and boreal forest in clear-cut stretches of land; this shows up clearly in aerial photos. The terrain {{that the power}} lines cross is {{for the most part}} not mountainous, but smooth and replete with lakes. Generally, four of the lines runs together in two pairs and the other two run solo, although the two single lines sometimes do run in a pair. Two intermediate 735kV power lines, one in the north and one in the south, connect all six power lines along their path to southern Quebec.|$|E

30|$|The <b>substation</b> {{main power}} {{supplies}} the {{power for the}} control and protection devices and the operation loops. The main power failure in a <b>substation</b> occurs, the protection device and operating circuit cannot operate, {{which is the most}} severe accident in the <b>substation.</b> Constrained by the construction and operating principle (include the battery system), the operation statistics indicates that the failure of <b>substation</b> main power frequently occurred. This fault is especially severe in the <b>substation</b> supplied by single main power. The fault which occurs in <b>substation</b> and its line can be cleared only by the remote backup protection in neighbor <b>substation.</b> Therefore, it is of great importance for avoiding the expanding of accident to effectively determine whether the main power of <b>substation</b> is failing and to accelerate the remote backup protection when faults occur in the no-power <b>substation.</b>|$|R

Utica is near the crossroads of major electrical-transmission lines, with <b>substations</b> {{in the town of}} Marcy. An expansion project by the New York Power Authority, National Grid, Consolidated Edison, and New York State Electric and Gas (NYSEG) is planned. In 2009 city businesses (including Utica College and St. Luke's Medical Center) developed a microgrid, and in 2012 the Utica City Council explored the possibility of a public, city-owned power company. Utica's natural gas {{is provided}} by National Grid and NYSEG.|$|E
30|$|In the <b>substation,</b> {{there is}} usually another {{communication}} power used for the remote communication except main power. These two kinds power is independent and backup of each other. Hence the <b>substation</b> area protection system can be supplied by both the main power and communication power. The system can monitor the running state. If the main power is lost, <b>substation</b> area protection system can be supplied by communication power and send the signal of power failure. When faults occur in the no-power <b>substation,</b> <b>substation</b> area protection will send tripping signal to adjacent <b>substation,</b> accelerating the speed of remote backup protection in adjacent <b>substation.</b> So the fault can be quickly isolated.|$|R

The project included {{restoration of the}} main lobby to emphasize the design features of the art deco era, elevator modernization, façade renovation and cleaning, and the continued renovation of upper floor corridors and hallways. Though impractically small for modern use, mailboxes in the lobby were restored to their original condition to follow the theme of vertical lines found throughout the complex. An improved electrical infrastructure, with ten main feeds from seven different Commonwealth Edison electrical <b>substations,</b> was added in addition to redundant cooling systems and upgraded telecommunications capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so <b>substations</b> used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E
