The designed micro-force sensing beam has both sensing and actuating layers.

When the instrument was deployed on the Moon, the <b>sensor</b> <b>beam</b> could not be balanced in the proper equilibrium position. Consequently, the LSG {{was not able to}} function as originally designed. Lauderdale and Eichelman (1974) [1] concluded that “no provision has been made to supply data from the experiment to the National Space Science Data Center. ” However, it was reported in Giganti et al. (1977) [2] that though they had not detected gravitational waves, after a series of reconfigurations the beam was recentered and the LSG gathered useful data. Besides the observation of gravitational waves, the LSG was also designed to observe seismic signals and tidal deformations [3]. According to Giganti et al. (1977) [2] LSG’s sensitivity covered the frequency range from 1 ~ 16 Hz (Fig. 1). There are several types of moonquakes reported, deep moonquakes, meteorite impacts, and high frequency teleseismic (HFT). Each of the moonquakes is known to have a resonant frequency around 1 Hz and in addition, HFT has a predominant frequency around 10 Hz [4].

Thus no transmitting media like oil is needed. The SOI sensor chip consists of a beam with an integrated center-boss which was realized using KOH structuring and DRIE (Deep Reactive Ion Etching/Bosch Process). The SOI technology has the distinct advantage that the piezo-resistors are not isolated by a pn junction from the dielectric substrate but by a buried oxide layer. In combination with a high temperature metallization, the SOI-chip is able to withstand the demands of high temperatures. The high temperature metallization consists of a sputtered Ti/TiWN layer that has been exposed to special RTA (rapid thermal annealing) process. Afterwards a TiWN and an Au layer are sputtered followed by an Au electro plating process. The chip has four piezoresistors that are arranged in pairs of longitudinal and transversal resistors which are compressed when pressure is applied. The four resistors are connected via conductors to a Wheatstone bridge. The sensor chip has a beam thickness of 25 μm and the center-boss has an area of lmm × lmm.

40|$|A novel optical {{diffraction}} based {{technique is}} proposed and demonstrated to measure deflections {{of the order}} of ~ 1 nm in microcantilevers (MC) designed for sensing ultra-small forces of stress. The proposed method employs a double MC structure where one of the cantilevers acts as the active <b>sensor</b> <b>beam,</b> while the other as a reference. The active beam can respond to any minute change of stress, for example, molecular recognition induced surface stress, through bending (~ 1 nm) relative to the other fixed beam. Optical diffraction patterns obtained from this double slit aperture mask with varying slit width, which is for the bending of MC due to loading, carries the deflection profile of the active beam. A significant part of the present work explores the possibility of connecting diffraction minima (or maxima) to the bending profile of the MC structure and thus the possibility to measure induced surface stress. To start with, it is also the aim to develop double MC sensors using PHDDA (Poly – Hexane diol diacrylate) because this material has the potential to achieve high mechanical deformation sensitivity in even moderately scaled down structures by virtue of its very low Young’s modulus. Moreover, the high thermal stability of PHDDA also ensures low thermally induced noise floors in microcantilever sensors. To demonstrate the proposed optical diffraction-based profiling technique, a bent microcantilever structure is designed and fabricated by an in-house developed Microstereolithography (MSL) system where, essentially one of the microcantilevers is fabricated with a bent profile by varying the gap between the two structures at each cured 2 D patterned layer. The diffraction pattern obtained on transilluminating the fabricated structure by a spherical wavefront is analyzed and the possibility of obtaining the deflections at each cross section is ascertained. Since the proposed profiling technique relies on the accurate detection and measurement of shifts of intensity minima on the image plane, analysis of the minimum detectable shift in intensity minima for the employed optical interrogation setup with respect to the minimum detectable contrast and SNR of the optical measurement system is carried out, in order to justify the applicability of the proposed minima intensity shift measurement technique. The proposed novel diffraction based profiling technique can provide vital clue on the origins of surface stress at the atomic and molecular level by virtue of the entire bent profile due to adsorption induced bending thereby establishing microcantilever sensor technology as a more reliable and competitive approach for sensing ultra-low concentrations of biological and chemical agents...|$|E

RISC systems should be cost-effective and reliable, and easy to setup and reconfigure. They should also be flexible enough to support small batch sizes and rapid changes in part design needed in forthcoming flexible /agile manufacturing systems. The RISC acronym, borrowed from computer architecture, suggests the parallels between the two technologies. RISC robots perform complex operations by composing simple elements. The elements may be individual light <b>beam</b> <b>sensors,</b> grouped together to form an array for recognition. Or a complex manipulation task may be performed via a sequence of grasp steps by different grippers specialized for a [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Automated airport weather {{stations}} use a Light Emitting Diode Weather Identifier (LEDWI) {{to determine if}} and what type of precipitation is falling. The LEDWI sensor measures the scintillation pattern of the precipitation falling through the <b>sensor's</b> infrared <b>beam</b> (approximately 50 millimeters in diameter) and determines from a pattern analysis of the particle size and fall velocity whether the precipitation is rain or snow. If precipitation is determined to be falling, but the pattern is not conclusively identified as either rain or snow, unknown precipitation is reported. Automated airport {{weather stations}} are not yet able to report hail, ice pellets, and various other intermediate forms of precipitation.|$|R
