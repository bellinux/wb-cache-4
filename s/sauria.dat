5|$|By 1824, the {{material}} available to Buckland consisted of specimen OUM J13505, {{a piece of}} a right lower jaw with a single erupted tooth; OUM J13577, a posterior dorsal vertebra; OUM J13579, an anterior caudal vertebra; OUM J13576, a sacrum of five sacral vertebrae; OUM J13585, a cervical rib; OUM J13580, a rib; OUM J29881, an ilium of the pelvis, OUM J13563, a piece of the pubic bone; OUM J13565, a part of the ischium; OUM J13561, a thighbone and OUM J13572, the lower part of a second metatarsal. As he himself was aware, these did not all belong to the same individual; only the sacrum was articulated. Because they represented several individuals, the described fossils formed a syntype series. By modern standards, from these a single specimen has to be selected to serve as the type specimen on which the name is based. In 1990, Ralph Molnar chose the famous dentary (front part of the lower jaw), OUM J13505, as such a lectotype. Because he was unaccustomed to the deep dinosaurian pelvis, much taller than with typical reptiles, Buckland misidentified several bones, interpreting the pubic bone as a fibula and mistaking the ischium for a clavicle. Buckland identified the organism as being a giant animal belonging to the <b>Sauria</b> – the Lizards, at the time seen as including the crocodiles – and he placed it in the new genus Megalosaurus, repeating an estimate by Cuvier that the largest pieces he described, indicated an animal twelve metres long in life.|$|E

In 1842, Owen made Megalosaurus {{one of the}} first three genera placed in the Dinosauria. In 1850, Prince Charles Lucien Bonaparte coined a separate family Megalosauridae with Megalosaurus as the type genus. For a long time, the precise relationships of Megalosaurus remained vague. It was seen as a [...] "primitive" [...] member of the Carnosauria, the group in which most large theropods were united.|$|E
500|$|Plateosaurus is {{a member}} of a group of early herbivores known as [...] "prosauropods". The group name is obsolete, as [...] "Prosauropoda" [...] is not a {{monophyletic}} group (thus given in quotation marks), and most researchers prefer the term basal sauropodomorph. Plateosaurus was the first [...] "prosauropod" [...] to be described, and gives its name to the family Plateosauridae Marsh, 1895 as the type genus. Initially, when the genus was poorly known, it was only included in <b>Sauria,</b> being some kind of reptile, but not in any more narrowly defined taxon. In 1845, von Meyer created the group Pachypodes (a defunct junior synonym of Dinosauria) to include Plateosaurus, Iguanodon, Megalosaurus and Hylaeosaurus. Plateosauridae was proposed by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1895 within Theropoda. Later it was moved to [...] "Prosauropoda" [...] by von Huene, a placement that was accepted by most authors. Before the advent of cladistics in paleontology during the 1980s, with its emphasis on monophyletic groups (clades), Plateosauridae was defined loosely, as large, broad-footed, broad-handed forms with relatively heavy skulls, unlike the smaller [...] "anchisaurids" [...] and sauropod-like [...] "melanorosaurids". Reevaluation of [...] "prosauropods" [...] in light of the new methods of analysis led to the reduction of Plateosauridae. For many years the clade only included Plateosaurus and various junior synonyms, but later two more genera were considered to belong to it: Sellosaurus and possibly Unaysaurus. Of these, Sellosaurus is probably another junior synonym of Plateosaurus.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{situation}} deteriorated, Baratieri reorganized his command: Albertone received {{command of the}} highly respected Native Brigade, formed with troops that served in the 2nd operational Corps, while Arimondi {{was moved to the}} I Infantry Brigade, a mixed formation that mostly comprised Italian units recently shipped from Italy.

2500|$|The first {{striking}} {{match with}} a phosphorus head {{was invented by}} Charles <b>Sauria</b> in 1830. These matches (and subsequent modifications) were made with heads of white phosphorus, an oxygen-releasing compound (potassium chlorate, lead dioxide, or sometimes nitrate), and a binder. They were poisonous to the workers in manufacture, sensitive to storage conditions, toxic if ingested, and hazardous when accidentally ignited on a rough surface. [...] Production in several countries was banned between 1872 and 1925. The international Berne Convention, ratified in 1906, prohibited the use of white phosphorus in matches.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 February, {{pressed by}} the Prime Minister Francesco Crispi, Baratieri had his forces dug in at strong {{positions}} at <b>Sauria,</b> [...] from Menelik's camp. By 27 February, {{the army had}} only a few days supply left and the intelligence wrongly reported that the Ethiopians were scattered across the hills of Adwa, foraging. Unable or unwilling to decide between a temporary withdrawal or a small advance, the Governor asked for the advice of his brigade commanders; Arimondi, Matteo Albertone, Vittorio Dabormida and the newly-appointed Giuseppe Ellena. [...] Arimondi estimated Menelik's forces at 50,000–60,000 warriors and, supported by his colleagues, urged for an aggressive approach.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, plesiosaurs were still poorly known and their special build was not understood. No {{systematic}} distinction was made with ichthyosaurs, so the fossils of one group were sometimes combined {{with those of the}} other to obtain a more complete specimen. In 1821, a partial skeleton discovered in the collection of Colonel Thomas James Birch, was described by William Conybeare and Henry Thomas De la Beche, and recognised as representing a distinctive group. A new genus was named, Plesiosaurus. The generic name was derived from the Greek πλήσιος, plèsios, [...] "closer to" [...] and the Latinised saurus, in the meaning of [...] "saurian", to express that Plesiosaurus was in the Chain of Being more closely positioned to the <b>Sauria,</b> particularly the crocodile, than Ichthyosaurus, which had the form of a more lowly fish. The name should thus be rather read as [...] "approaching the Sauria" [...] or [...] "near reptile" [...] than as [...] "near lizard". Parts of the specimen are still present in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} half of the nineteenth century, the number of plesiosaur finds {{steadily}} increased, especially through discoveries in the sea cliffs of Lyme Regis. Sir Richard Owen alone named nearly a hundred new species. The majority of their descriptions were, however, based on isolated bones, without sufficient diagnosis to be able to distinguish them from the other species that had previously been described. Many of the new species described at this time have subsequently been invalidated. The genus Plesiosaurus is particularly problematic, as the majority of the new species were placed in it so that it became a wastebasket taxon. Gradually, other genera were named. Hawkins had already created new genera, though these are no longer seen as valid. In 1841, Owen named Pliosaurus brachydeirus. Its etymology referred to the earlier Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus as it is derived from πλεῖος, pleios, [...] "more fully", reflecting that according to Owen it was closer to the <b>Sauria</b> than Plesiosaurus. Its specific name means [...] "with a short neck". Later, the Pliosauridae were recognised as having a morphology fundamentally different from the plesiosaurids. The family Plesiosauridae had already been coined by John Edward Gray in 1825. In 1835, Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville named the order Plesiosauria itself.|$|E

5000|$|The name <b>Sauria</b> {{was coined}} by James Macartney (1802); {{it was the}} Latinisation of the French name Sauriens, coined by Alexandre Brongniart (1800) for an order of {{reptiles}} in the classification proposed by the author, containing lizards and crocodilians, later discovered not to be each other's closest relatives. Later authors used the term [...] "Sauria" [...] in a more restricted sense, i.e. as a synonym of Lacertilia, a suborder of Squamata that includes all lizards but excludes snakes. This classification is rarely used today because <b>Sauria</b> so-defined is a paraphyletic group. It {{was defined as a}} clade by Jacques Gauthier, Arnold G. Kluge and Timothy Rowe (1988) as the group containing the most recent common ancestor of archosaurs and lepidosaurs (the groups containing crocodiles and lizards, as per Mcartney's original definition) and all its descendants. A different definition was formulated by Michael deBraga and Olivier Rieppel (1997), who defined <b>Sauria</b> as the clade containing the most recent common ancestor of Choristodera, Archosauromorpha, Lepidosauromorpha and all their descendants.
