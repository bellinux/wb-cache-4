5|$|The {{terms of}} the February 1922 Washington Naval Treaty forced the class' cancellation, but the two closest to {{completion}} (Amagi and Akagi) were saved from the scrappers by a provision that allowed two capital ships to be converted to aircraft carriers. However, the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake caused <b>significant</b> <b>stress</b> damage to the hull of Amagi. The structure was too heavily damaged to be usable, and conversion work was abandoned. Amagi was struck from the navy list and sold for scrapping, which began on 14 April 1924. The other two ships, Atago and Takao, were officially cancelled two years later (31 July 1924) and were broken up for scrap in their slipways. Akagi went on as an aircraft carrier {{to fight in the}} Second World War, where it was sunk after air attack during the Battle of Midway.|$|E

For instance, though no formal {{studies have been}} conducted yet, it is generally acknowledged within the church that the rising number of parents who work as overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) places <b>significant</b> <b>stress</b> in the maintenance of relationships among members within families. Moreover, the growing number of parents who labor as call center agents also adds to the difficulty in raising families, as call center agents often have to work in night schedules thereby decreasing the amount of time of being with their respective families.|$|E
25|$|Given {{conflicting}} {{evidence of the}} costs and benefits of smoking, controversy remains on what the clinical response to smoking in people with schizophrenia should be. Historically, mental health providers have overlooked smoking in schizophrenia, based on the rationale that patients with serious mental illness already suffer from <b>significant</b> <b>stress</b> and disability and as such should be allowed to engage in smoking as an activity that is pleasurable though destructive. There is also historical precedent of mental health providers, particularly in patient settings, to use cigarettes as a way to manipulate patient behavior, such as rewarding good behavior with cigarettes or withholding cigarettes to encourage medication compliance. However, research showing that eliminating even one risk factor for disease can significantly improve long-term health outcomes has resulted in the dominant view among clinicians opposing smoking.|$|E

50|$|A {{shell is}} a type of {{structural}} element which is characterized by its geometry, being a three-dimensional solid whose thickness is very small when compared with other dimensions, and in structural terms, by the stress resultants calculated in the middle plane displaying components which are both coplanar and normal to the surface.Essentially, a shell can be derived from a plate by two means: by initially forming the middle surface as a singly or doubly curved surface, and by applying loads which are coplanar to a plate's plane which generate <b>significant</b> <b>stresses.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of literary production in Old French is in verse; the development of prose as a literary form was a late phenomenon (in the late Middle Ages, many of the romances and epics were converted into prose versions). [...] The French language {{does not have a}} <b>significant</b> <b>stress</b> accent (like English) or long and short syllables (like Latin). [...] This means that the French metric line is not determined by the number of beats, but by the number of syllables. The most common metric lengths are the ten-syllable line (decasyllable), the eight-syllable line (octosyllable) and the twelve-syllable line (the [...] "alexandrine"). [...] Verses could be combined in a variety of ways: blocks (of varying lengths) of assonanced (occasionally rhymed) lines are called [...] "laisses"; another frequent form is the rhymed couplet. [...] The choice of verse form was generally dictated by the genre. [...] The Old French epics ("chansons de geste") are generally written in ten-syllable assonanced [...] "laisses", [...] while the chivalric romance ("roman") was usually written in octosyllabic rhymed couplets.|$|E

The deformation of wavy/buckle profiles, with a range of nano- and micro-scale wavelengths, is modeled using finite element simulations. The predictions from the models are then validated using experiments that involve the bending of layered structures that are relevant to flexible organic electronics. The introduction of pre-buckled profiles is shown to increase the range of deformation that is applied to model structures, prior to onset of <b>significant</b> <b>stresses</b> and strains. The implications of the work are discussed for the design of robust flexible organic solar cells...|$|R
