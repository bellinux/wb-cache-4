Primary jaw crusher product in intermediate feed particle size ranges (100mm > P80 > 20mm) can be ground in Autogenous or Semi-Autogenous (AG or <b>SAG)</b> <b>mills</b> depending on feed properties and application requirements. For comminution of finer particle size ranges (20mm > P80 > 30 μm) machines like the ball mill, vertical roller mill, hammer mill, roller press or high compression roller mill, vibration mill, jet mill and others are used.

40|$|DEM {{modelling}} of {{the motion}} of coarse fractions of the charge inside <b>SAG</b> <b>mills</b> has now been well established {{for more than a}} decade. In these models the effect of slurry has broadly been ignored due to its complexity. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) provides a particle based method for modelling complex free surface fluid flows and is well suited to modelling fluid flow in mills. Previous modelling has demonstrated the powerful ability of SPH to capture dynamic fluid flow effects such as lifters crashing into slurry pools, fluid draining from lifters, flow through grates and pulp lifter discharge. However, all these examples were limited by the ability to model only the slurry in the mill without the charge. In this paper, we represent the charge as a dynamic porous media through which the SPH fluid is then able to flow. The porous media properties (specifically the spatial distribution of porosity and velocity) are predicted by time averaging the mill charge predicted using a large scale DEM model. This allows prediction of transient and steady state slurry distributions in the mill and allows its variation with operating parameters, slurry viscosity and slurry volume, to be explored.

The energy consumption obtained for grinding in the pilot tests was compared with that reported by Donda and Bond. The SSSAG route had the lowest energy consumption, 11. 8 kWh/t and the SAB route had the highest energy consumption, 15. 8 kWh/t. The CB and SABC routes had a similar energy consumption of 14. 4 kWh/t and 14. 5 kWh/t respectively...|$|E
40|$|The Namakwa Sands heavy {{mineral deposit}} {{is located at}} Brand-se-Baai along the West Coast of South Africa and is a world class {{producer}} of premium quality zircon (ZrSiO 4), ilmenite (FeTiO 3) and rutile (TiO 2) concentrates from mainly aeolian sands. Superimposed on the coastal clastic Cainozoic ore-bearing sequence is a calcium-magnesium-rich pseudo-stratigraphy locally referred to as cemented hard layers that effectively lithify the mineralised sands to various degrees of hardness, rendering it unsuitable for routine treatment by wet spirals. Namakwa Sands has recently completed an expansion programme, inclusive of a <b>SAG</b> <b>mill</b> and screen installation, which allows the processing of the cemented hard layers, the first ever in the mineral sands industry. Operationally, the <b>SAG</b> <b>mill</b> and screen are performing well in tandem and are helping to improve mineral resource utilisation to levels not previously possible. Contained zircon output has increased, but {{at the cost of}} marginally lower recoveries as predicted from pilot studies. This paper reports on the systematic geometallurgical approach to improve mineral resource utilisation by successfully processing lithified ore. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} assessing the downstream milling energy requirements for high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) products based on a Bond mill test procedure. Multiple trade-off studies have reported the performance of HPGR versus <b>SAG</b> <b>milling</b> with energy savings of between 11 and 32 per cent. One factor that is often inconsistently defined in these studies is {{the change in the}} Bond Ball Work Index (BBWi). The Bond test can overestimate the reduction in ball milling energy requirements for HPGR products, not due to a change in the breakage characteristics of the particles, but because the Bond test feed for a sample crushed in a HPGR has a greater fines content than a conventionally-crushed sample. This paper rigorously assesses the actual change in BBWi achieved through the use of HPGR technology. The reduction in BBWi was found to not be dependent on the ore hardness and thus the expression of the change as a per cent is incorrect. When the size distribution of the HPGR product was matched to the crushed product, more than 95 % of the samples tested resulted in a reduction in Work Index, with an average reduction of 1. 9. kWh/t. A proportional reduction was seen when the Size Specific Energy (SSE) was calculated for the reconstituted samples. Six samples were tested where the original size distributions were retained and these saw greater reduction in BBWi than SSE. A gold mine was surveyed to investigate the ball milling requirements of an industrial HPGR circuit. Two surveys of the ball mill operating at different conditions found that milling efficiency could be improved by 20 %. These results highlight the importance of the mills operating conditions on energy efficiency as they can overwhelm the potential benefits of HPGR pre-conditioning...|$|R
40|$|The power {{required}} to operate large gyratory mills often exceeds 10 MW. Hence, optimisation {{of the power}} consumption will {{have a significant impact}} on the overall economic performance and environmental impact of the mineral processing plant. In most of the published models of tumbling mills (e. g. [Morrell, S., 1996. Power draw of wet tumbling mills and its relationship to charge dynamics, Part 2 : An empirical approach to modelling of mill power draw. Trans. Inst. Mining Metall. (Section C: Mineral Processing Ext. Metall.) 105, C 54 -C 62. Austin, L. G., 1990. A mill power equation for <b>SAG</b> <b>mills.</b> Miner. Metall. Process. 57 - 62]), the effect of lifter design and its interaction with mill speed and filling are not incorporated. Recent experience suggests that there is an opportunity for improving grinding efficiency by choosing the appropriate combination of these variables. However, it is difficult to experimentally determine the interactions of these variables in a full scale mill. Although some work has recently been published using DEM simulations, it was basically. limited to 2 D. The discrete element code, Particle Flow Code 3 D (PFC 3 D), has been used in this work to model the effects of lifter height (525 cm) and mill speed (50 - 90 % of critical) on the power draw and frequency distribution of specific energy (J/kg) of normal impacts in a 5 m diameter autogenous (AG) mill. It was found that the distribution of the impact energy is affected by the number of lifters, lifter height, mill speed and mill filling. Interactions of lifter design, mill speed and mill filling are demonstrated through three dimensional distinct element methods (3 D DEM) modelling. The intensity of the induced stresses (shear and normal) on lifters, and hence the lifter wear, is also simulated. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|DEM {{models of}} fine {{grinding}} in ball and stirred mills have to date almost entirely {{focused on the}} motion of the media and their interaction with the <b>mill</b> configuration. For <b>SAG</b> <b>mills,</b> a large fraction of the feed material can now be accurately represented in DEM models. However, for other mill types with much finer feed materials, such as the second chamber of a cement ball mill, the vast numbers of feed particles makes their explicit inclusion in the models prohibitive. However, it is now feasible to model a periodic section of a laboratory scale ball mill and include the coarser end of the ore size distribution directly in the DEM model. This provides the opportunity to better understand the effect of media on the interstitial bed of powder and of the effect of the powder on the media. The effect of the powder fill level, which is varied between 0 % and 150 % of the pore space in the media charge, is explored. The distribution of the powder, its effect on power draw {{and the way in which}} it contributes to the pattern of energy utilisation is assessed. The simulation results are compared with experimental results from a test at similar ball loading and rotation rate and for several size fractions of ore at a range of powder fill fractions. Tracking the collision histories of specific ore particles within the charge allows estimates of the probability (per unit time) of collision between media and ore particles (the “Selection” function) and of the intensity of each collision which can be used to estimate the severity of breakage using the JKMRC breakage model (the “Breakage” function). The energy spectra indicate that for a typical ore, only very few collisions are large enough to cause damage to the body of each particle. This provides an estimate of the energy efficiency which is less than 10 % at even the best operating conditions...|$|R
