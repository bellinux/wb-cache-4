The deep {{underwater}} test, Charlie, scheduled for early 1947, would take place in the ocean west of Bikini. Of the possible places given serious consideration, including Ecuador's Galápagos Islands, Bikini offered the most remote location with a large protected anchorage, suitable but not ideal weather, and a small, easily moved population. It had come under exclusive United States control on January 15, when Truman declared the United States to be the <b>sole</b> <b>trustee</b> of all the Pacific islands captured from Japan during the war. The Navy had been studying test sites since October 1945 and was ready to announce its choice of Bikini soon after Truman's declaration. On February 6, the survey ship Sumner began blasting channels through the Bikini reef into the lagoon. The local residents were not told why.|$|E

40|$|Waqf and its {{management}} in Malaysia {{have been very}} much neglected by the relevant authorities for a relatively long period of time. In Malaysia, waqf is managed by State Islamic Religious Councils (SIRCs), which is the <b>sole</b> <b>trustees</b> for waqf resources. The emergence of Islamic economics and the pressing demands for greater countability and better performance {{in the public sector}} organisations provided an impetus for the waqf revival in Malaysia. Thus this study empirically investigated the accounting, accountability and effectiveness of the waqf management in Malaysia. A questionnaire survey examining the current practices of the principal management activities including strategic planning, budgeting and budgetary control, performance measurement and financial reporting was distributed to thirteen SIRCs and two semi-autonomous baytulmal institutions, one in Sabah and the other in Sarawak. Furthermore, a series of semi-structured interviews was conducted on the senior and operational officers of SIRCs/baytulmal institutions, the Department of Awqaf, Zakah and Hajj (JAWHAR), the Malaysia Waqf Foundation (MWF) and the National Audit Department (NAD). Essentially, the study revealed a number of noticeable findings with regard to the principal management activities in SIRCs/baytulmal institutions. Firstly, budgeting in SIRCs/baytulmal institutions appeared to function mainly as planning and control tools. The strict approach to budgetary control in these organisations was to ensure the adherence of spending to the budgets while the efficiency and effectiveness of resource consumption were less emphasised. Delegation of authority and responsibility to operational managers was restricted to budgetary control. Secondly, there were evidences of conspicuous discrepancies in the financial reporting practice. This may have been attributed by the absence of specific accounting framework for Islamic assets and funds held by SIRCs/baytulmal institutions. The financial reporting practice in these organisations had less focused on the stewardship/accountability dimension expected of the public sector and non-profit organisations. Thirdly, performance measurement in SIRCs/baytulmal institutions appeared to be focusing on enhancing the administrative capacity of the organisations. Fourthly, the existence of strategic planning in SIRCs/baytulmal institutions was very limited and mainly conditioned on external requirements. Finally, the study also revealed the presence of inherent challenges in the waqf management in SIRCs/baytulmal institutions, namely, financial inadequacy, shortages of manpower, and limited administrative capacity. The present practice of the principal management activities and the inherent challenges {{had a profound impact on}} the extent of accountability and effectiveness of the waqf management in Malaysia...|$|R
5000|$|In February 2006 {{under the}} {{assumption}} that it was the <b>sole</b> responsible <b>trustee</b> of CLO property, the University of Florida Office of Student Affairs attempted to seize control of the property by shutting down CLO operations. This was on the grounds that students were no longer capable of independent maintenance of the physical plant, citing several safety violations. They also tried to say that the cooperative’s mission was irrelevant with respect to the average social and financial status of modern students of the University of Florida. The move caused an international response from CLO alumni, friends and families of graduates facilitated by internet communication in solidarity with current members of the organization. This response resulted in a court-mediated agreement between the University of Florida and CLO members and alumni. The proceedings were tracked closely by local newspapers, The Gainesville Sun and the University of Florida student paper, The Independent Florida Alligator, whose editorials generally supported the position of the historic student organization. [...] During this period the CLO Alumni Foundation (CLOAF) was organized and was appointed trustee of the property with CLO as its continued beneficiary.

5000|$|In 1543, {{following}} the Dissolution, {{with part of}} it having already been demolished, Bell had purchased the site and an adjoining cottage from the Crown. In 1559, by then an old man, perhaps as a final charitable gesture to ease his path to Heaven, Bell built a [...] "Hospital" [...] or almshouse {{to the east of}} the cottage, comprising a low terrace of five individual rooms each with its own front door. ("Hospital" [...] in this ancient sense refers to the function of sheltering guests, from the Latin hospes, a stranger, foreigner, hence a guest.) The original cottage itself formed a 6th almshouse, the body of the chapel being used by the almsmen for prayers. Bell drafted his will in the same year leaving it, with endowments to fund its continuation, to the City Corporation. However, 3 years later in 1562, altering his plan, Bell and his wife settled it instead on a body of 10 trustees, among whom were William Bell of Sandhurst his nephew and Thomas Denys, husband of his niece Joan, thus establishing it as a trust, who took possession after the deaths of Bell and his wife Joan in 1566 and 1567 respectively. Under the terms of the trust deed the hospital was to maintain six poor people, one of them, if possible, to be a burgess of Gloucester. Bell and his wife Joan had donated as an endowment for the Hospital the site of Whitefriars Monastery, Morin's Mill in Brook Street, six houses, and the rent of another house, having a total annual value of £16-0s-4d. This was intended to finance quarterly payments of 13s 4d to each of the almspersons. [...] By 1598 the trustees had dwindled in number to only two, one of whom was Denys, having been negligent in making reappointments, and they sought and were granted licence to convey the trust assets to the ownership and management of the Mayor and Burgesses of Gloucester. The assets were so transferred five years later in 1603, by which time Denys was the <b>sole</b> surviving <b>trustee.</b>|$|R
40|$|William Herbert Ifould (1877 - 1969) was Principal Librarian of the Public Library of New South Wales from 1912 to 1942, {{spanning}} critical {{years for}} library services in Australia, including the two Wars, the Great Depression, the Munn-Pitt Report, {{the campaign of}} the Free Library Movement and {{the passing of the}} New South Wales Library Act. He has however been neglected by scholars of this period of Australian library history. This study examines Ifould's activities during these years, and assesses his significance for the Public Library of New South Wales, for free public libraries and for the library profession in Australia. The study involved the examination of primary and secondary materials by and about Ifould in libraries, archives and private hands, and works on his Library and Australian librarianship of the period. There were interviews and correspondence with people who knew him, including former members of his staff, friends, neighbours, contemporaries in other libraries, members of his family, former users of the Library, and the <b>sole</b> surviving Library <b>Trustee</b> from the Ifould era. The study describes how Ifould achieved status as a public figure, a public servant and a professional librarian, and helped to create a hospitable climate for library development. It shows the lengths to which he went to achieve his objectives, including the completion of the Library building, the securing of benefactions, the development of the Library's collections, the containment of costs and the selection of staff. It provides the first detailed accounts of the Libraries Advisory Committee, which Ifould chaired, the passing of the Library Act and the formation of the Library Board of New South Wales. It also reveals the extent to which his successor, John Metcalfe, was indebted to him. The study concludes that Ifould's role throughout the period was highly significant, and that he {{played a critical role in}} laying the foundation for free public library services in New South Wales...|$|R
