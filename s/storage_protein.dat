40|$|In the {{parenchyma}} {{cells of}} developing legume cotyledons, <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> are deposited {{in a special}} type of vacuole, known as the <b>protein</b> <b>storage</b> vacuole (PSV). <b>Storage</b> <b>proteins</b> are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum and pass through the Golgi apparatus. In contrast to lysosomal acid hydrolases, <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> exit the Golgi apparatus in 130 -nm-diameter electron-dense vesicles rather than in clathrin-coated vesicles. By combining isopycnic and rate zonal sucrose density gradient centrifugation with phase partitioning, we obtained a highly enriched dense vesicle fraction. This fraction contained prolegumin, which is the precursor {{of one of the}} major <b>storage</b> <b>proteins.</b> In dense vesicles, prolegumin occurred in a more aggregated form than it did in the endoplasmic reticulum. The putative vacuolar sorting receptor BP- 80 was highly enriched in purified clathrin-coated vesicles, which, in turn, did not contain prolegumin. The amount of BP- 80 was markedly reduced in the dense vesicle fraction. This result was confirmed by quantitative immunogold labeling of cryosections of pea cotyledons: whereas antibodies raised against BP- 80 significantly labeled the Golgi stacks, labeling of the dense vesicles could not be detected. In contrast, 90 % of the dense vesicles were labeled with antibodies raised against alpha-TIP (for tonoplast intrinsic protein), which is the aquaporin specific for the membrane of the PSV. These results lead to the conclusions that <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> and alpha-TIP are delivered via the same vesicular pathway into the PSVs and that the dense vesicles that carry these proteins in turn do not contain BP- 80...|$|R

Lumenal {{as well as}} membrane proteins of the <b>protein</b> <b>storage</b> vacuole {{exit the}} Golgi apparatus in dense vesicles rather than in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Although the sorting receptor for vacuolar hydrolases BP- 80 is present in CCVs, it is not detectable in dense vesicles. To localize these different vacuolar sorting events in the Golgi, we have compared the distribution of vacuolar <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> and of �-TIP, a membrane protein of the <b>protein</b> <b>storage</b> vacuole, with {{the distribution of the}} vacuolar sorting receptor BP- 80 across the Golgi stack. Analysis of immunogold labeling from cryosections and from high pressure frozen samples has revealed a steep gradient in the distribution of the <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> within the Golgi stack. Intense labeling for <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> was registered for the cis-cisternae, contrasting with very low labeling for these antigens in the trans-cisternae.
