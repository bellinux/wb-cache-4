Shared file access is based on server side pushing of folder information, and is normally used over an [...] "always on" [...] Internet socket. File synchronization allows the user to be offline from time to time, and is normally based on an agent software that polls synchronized machines at reconnect, and sometimes repeatedly with a certain time interval, to discover differences. Modern operating systems often include a local cache of remote files, allowing offline access and synchronization when reconnected.|$|R

With color, Y still represents intensity but it is a composite of the component colors.|$|R
50|$|Asynchronous serial {{communication}} {{is a form}} of {{serial communication}} in which the communicating endpoints' interfaces are not continuously synchronized by a common clock signal. Instead of a common synchronization signal, the data stream contains <b>synchronization</b> <b>information</b> in form of start and stop signals, before and after each unit of transmission, respectively.

40|$|Adaptive {{steganography}} which avoids {{changing the}} sensitive area in carrier, can effectively improve {{the security of}} steganography. Firstly, the schemes of side <b>information</b> <b>synchronization</b> in adaptive steganography are summarized and analyzed. Secondly, using the freedom degree which is extented by the previous one-way texture functions, a new order-preserving texture function as side information of adaptive steganography is constructed. Finally, by combining wet paper codes and the method of multi-layered embedding, ± 1 algorithm and ± 2 algorithm are proposed. The proposed scheme can efficiently enhance the security of adaptive steganography while maintaining fast side <b>information</b> <b>synchronization</b> between communicators.

50|$|The {{container}} file is used {{to identify}} and interleave different data types. Simpler container formats can contain different types of audio formats, while more advanced container formats can support multiple audio and video streams, subtitles, chapter-information, and meta-data (tags) — along with the <b>synchronization</b> <b>information</b> needed to play back the various streams together. In most cases, the file header, most of the metadata and the synchro chunks are specified by the container format. For example, container formats exist for optimized, low-quality, internet video streaming which differs from high-quality Blu-ray streaming requirements.|$|E
50|$|SATA {{physical}} coding uses a line encoding system {{known as}} 8b/10b encoding. This scheme serves multiple functions required {{to sustain a}} differential serial link. First, the stream contains necessary <b>synchronization</b> <b>information</b> that allows the SATA host/drive to extract clocking. The 8b/10b encoded sequence embeds periodic edge transitions to allow the receiver to achieve bit-alignment {{without the use of}} a separately transmitted reference clock waveform. The sequence also maintains a neutral (DC-balanced) bitstream, which allows the transmit drivers and receiver inputs to be AC-coupled. Generally, the actual SATA signalling is half-duplex, meaning that it can only read or write data at any one time.|$|E
50|$|The {{colors in}} those systems are encoded {{with one of}} three color coding schemes: NTSC, PAL, or SECAM, and then use RF {{modulation}} to modulate this signal onto a very high frequency (VHF) or ultra high frequency (UHF) carrier. Each frame of a television image is composed of lines drawn on the screen. The lines are of varying brightness; the whole set of lines is drawn quickly enough that the human eye perceives it as one image. The next sequential frame is displayed, allowing the depiction of motion. The analog television signal contains timing and <b>synchronization</b> <b>information,</b> so that the receiver can reconstruct a two-dimensional moving image from a one-dimensional time-varying signal.|$|E

50|$|The IEEE 1588 {{standards}} {{describe a}} hierarchical master-slave architecture for clock distribution. Under this architecture, a time distribution system consists {{of one or}} more communication media (network segments), and one or more clocks. An ordinary clock is a device with a single network connection and is either the source of (master) or destination for (slave) a synchronization reference. A boundary clock has multiple network connections and can accurately synchronize one network segment to another. A synchronization master is selected for each of the network segments in the system. The root timing reference is called the grandmaster. The grandmaster transmits <b>synchronization</b> <b>information</b> to the clocks residing on its network segment. The boundary clocks with a presence on that segment then relay accurate time to the other segments to which they are also connected.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] object {{contains}} properties {{unique to}} the type of the object as well as static methods that implement the services offered by the object. Objects managed by Object Manager must at least provide a predefined set of services: [...] (which closes a handle to an object), [...] (create another handle to the object with which another process can gain shared access to the object), [...] (gather information about its attributes and properties), [...] (get the security descriptor of the object), [...] (change the security access), and [...] (to synchronize with one or more objects via certain events). Type objects also have some common attributes, including the type name, whether they are to be allocated in non-paged memory, access rights, and <b>synchronization</b> <b>information.</b> All instances of the same type share the same type object, and the type object is instantiated only once. A new object type can be created by endowing an object with Properties to expose its state and methods to expose the services it offers.|$|E
50|$|Time {{synchronization}} in TSN networks can {{be achieved}} with different technologies. Theoretically, {{it is possible to}} outfit every end device and network switch with a GPS clock. However, this is costly and {{there is no guarantee that}} the Radio or GPS clock has access to the radio or satellite signal at all times - for example if the network is installed in a moving car, on a factory floor or in a tunnel deep beneath the surface of the earth. Due to these constraints, time in TSN networks is usually distributed from one central time source directly through the network itself. In most cases, this is done using the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol, which utilizes Ethernet frames to distribute time <b>synchronization</b> <b>information.</b> In addition to the universally applicable IEEE 1588 specification, the Time-Sensitive Task Group of the IEEE 802.1 committee has specified a profile of IEEE 1588, called IEEE 802.1AS-2011. The idea behind this profile is to narrow the huge list of different IEEE 1588 options down to a manageable few critical options that are applicable to Home networks or networks in automotive car or industrial automation environments.|$|E

40|$|The {{thalamus}} and hippocampus {{have been}} found both involved in the initiation, propagation, and termination of temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the interaction of these regions during seizures is not clear. The present study is to explore whether some regular patterns exist in their interaction during the termination of seizures. Multichannel in vivo recording techniques were used to record the neural activities from the cornu ammonis 1 (CA 1) of hippocampus and mediodorsal thalamus (MDT) in mice. The mice were kindled by electrically stimulating basolateral amygdala neurons, and Racine’s rank standard was employed to classify the stage of behavioral responses (stage 1 ~ 5). The coupling index and directionality index were used to investigate the <b>synchronization</b> and <b>information</b> flow direction between CA 1 and MDT. Two main results were found in this study. (1) High levels of synchronization between the thalamus and hippocampus were observed before the termination of seizures at stage 4 ~ 5 but after the termination of seizures at stage 1 ~ 2. (2) In the end of seizures at stage 4 ~ 5, the information tended to flow from MDT to CA 1. Those {{results indicate that the}} <b>synchronization</b> and <b>information</b> flow direction between the thalamus and the hippocampus may participate in the termination of seizures...|$|R
