5|$|The Whitby Regatta {{takes place}} {{annually}} over {{three days in}} August. The competition between three rowing clubs – Whitby Friendship ARC, Whitby Fishermen's ARC and Scarborough ARC – forms {{the backbone of the}} weekend.

5|$|The Stonyhurst Officer Training Corps {{assembled}} for {{the first}} time on 16 October 1900, in the Ambulacrum, overseen by The First Volunteer Battalion, the East Lancashire Regiment who gave instruction in drill and musketry. The original uniform was scarlet with a white piping and slouch hat, which was changed to khaki before the First World War. The Corps was granted the honour of representation at the Coronation of 1910 and sent members to the Royal Review at Windsor in 1911. It also appeared on parade annually for the <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> the Corpus Christi celebrations until the practice became obsolete after Vatican II.|$|E

5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post {{for more than a}} month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when the horrors of the latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{reaching}} the Emerald City (an analogue of the real-life World Trade Center plaza), the quintet gains passage {{into the city}} because of Dorothy's ownership of the silver slippers; they marvel at the <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> {{the city and its}} sophisticated, fashion forward dancers. They are granted an audience with the Wiz (Richard Pryor), who lives {{at the very top of}} the Towers. He appears to them as a giant fire-breathing metallic head. He will only grant their wishes if they kill the sister of the Wicked Witch of the East, Evillene (Mabel King), the Wicked Witch of the West, who runs a sweatshop in the underground sewers of Oz. Before they can reach her domain, Evillene learns of their quest to kill her and sends out the Flying Monkeys (a motorcycle gang) to kidnap them.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} on Criterion's proprietary game engine RenderWare. The graphics engine was improved to give between 50–100% faster rendering than in Burnout 2. The increased performance {{allowed them to}} add features like real-time radiosity lighting and better environment mapping effects on vehicles. Programmers at the studio were adamant about making the game run at a frame rate of sixty frames per seconds to offer instant response and feedback while driving fast. Since the crash sequences were slower, the higher frame rate was less considered less critical than the <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle collisions. They opted to run the game at thirty frames per second during these instances and dramatically {{increased the number of}} particles and debris that were rendered. From an early stage in development, the team wanted to include support for online network play in Burnout 3. They had never explored online play before, so they used Burnout 2 as a test-bed for the feature before integrating it into Burnout 3.|$|E

5|$|The right panel (220 × 97.5cm, 87 × 38.4in) {{illustrates}} Hell, {{the setting}} {{of a number of}} Bosch paintings. Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to evil and reap eternal damnation. The tone of this final panel strikes a harsh contrast to those preceding it. The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is noticeably absent. Compared to the warmth of the center panel, the right wing possesses a chilling qualityrendered through cold colourisation and frozen waterwaysand presents a tableau that has shifted from the paradise of the center image to a <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> cruel torture and retribution. In a single, densely detailed scene, the viewer is made witness to cities on fire in the background; war, torture chambers, infernal taverns, and demons in the midground; and mutated animals feeding on human flesh in the foreground. The nakedness of the human figures has lost all its eroticism, and many now attempt to cover their genitalia and breasts with their hands.|$|E

It also {{discusses the}} limits between reality and fiction in the <b>spectacles</b> <b>of</b> UTA. The analysis is basically guided by Walter Benjamin’s writings on experience, narration and tradition. It also deals with the concepts of artistic creation from French essayist Paul Valéry...|$|R
25|$|Its albums {{generally}} {{fall into}} two categories: deconstructions of Western popular music, and complex conceptual pieces composed around a theme, theory, or plot.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{consider}} {{the concept of the}} happiness. The text refers to several literary examples of the happiness and characterizes “the <b>spectacles</b> <b>of</b> the happiness”. It shows (in the context of Blanchot’s words) manifold destructive practices associated with the happiness with reference to everyday life. The paper compares the life to the structure <b>of</b> the <b>spectacle</b> and analyses “the <b>spectacles</b> <b>of</b> the happiness” in the context of Goffman’s theory (scene and wings, shown and hidden activities). The article expresses criticism of the vision of life based on the spectacular happiness. ...|$|R

25|$|Those minstrels {{who stayed}} in New York and similar cities {{followed}} Barnum's lead by advertising relentlessly and emphasizing the <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> minstrelsy. Troupes ballooned; {{as many as}} 19 performers could be on stage at once, and J. H. Haverly's United Mastodon Minstrels had over 100 members. Scenery grew lavish and expensive, and specialty acts like Japanese acrobats or circus freaks sometimes appeared. These changes made minstrelsy unprofitable for smaller troupes.|$|E
25|$|Between 1936 and 1938, {{three very}} large Moscow Trials of former senior Communist Party leaders were held, {{in which they}} were accused of conspiring with fascist and {{capitalist}} powers to assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, dismember the Soviet Union and restore capitalism. These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was mesmerized by the <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> Lenin's closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences.|$|E
25|$|Jake Esterline {{claimed that}} {{a box of}} cigars, which was treated with chemicals, was also {{considered}} in the plot to assassinate Castro. The scheme was that the chemical would produce temporary personality disorientation, and having Castro smoke one before a speech would result in Castro making a “public <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> himself”. Esterline later admitted that even though he couldn't exactly recall what the cigars were intended to do, he didn’t believe they were lethal.|$|E
