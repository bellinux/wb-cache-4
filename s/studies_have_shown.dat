5|$|Despite the {{stresses}} that SCI places on people and relationships, <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> {{that people with}} SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them, but <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents. Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives.|$|E
5|$|For {{antioxidant}} therapy, <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that reactive oxidative species lead to {{the formation}} of multiple sclerosis lesions in which antioxidants can help induce neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. Probably the most clear disease modifying factor (for worse) is smoking, and therefore to quit smoking should be considered.|$|E

5|$|Linezolid is in U.S. {{pregnancy}} category C, meaning {{there have}} been no adequate studies of its safety when used by pregnant women, and although animal <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> mild toxicity to the fetus, the benefits of using the drug may outweigh its risks. It also passes into breast milk, although the clinical significance of this (if any) is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Numerical <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> {{that over}} {{millions}} of years, the general nature of the alignment between the orbits of Pluto and Neptune does not change. There are several other resonances and interactions that enhance Pluto's stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1990s the {{function}} of the cerebellum was almost universally believed to be purely motor-related, but newer findings have brought that view into question. Functional imaging <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> cerebellar activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> interactions between the cerebellum and non-motor areas of the cerebral cortex; and a variety of non-motor symptoms have been recognized in people with damage that appears to be confined to the cerebellum. In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome has been described in adults and children. Estimates based on functional mapping of the cerebellum using functional MRI suggest {{that more than half of}} the cerebellar cortex is interconnected with association zones of the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|Sponges were {{traditionally}} {{distributed in}} three classes: calcareous sponges (Calcarea), glass sponges (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae). However, <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that the Homoscleromorpha, a group thought {{to belong to}} the Demospongiae, is actually phylogenetically well separated. Therefore, they have recently been recognized as the fourth class of sponges.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males {{that attempt to}} monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals. Female selection however, {{has been shown to}} help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oligantha {{is listed}} as an {{endangered}} species under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and as rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. These rankings are due to its small and severely fragmented distribution, and the ongoing degradation of its habitat. Threats include grazing by sheep and rabbits, drought, the drift of aerosol chemicals from surrounding farmland, invasion by weeds, and rising salinity. <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> it to be moderately susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|Financial markets on the {{continent}} {{are expected to be}} far more liquid and flexible {{than they were in the}} past. The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone.
