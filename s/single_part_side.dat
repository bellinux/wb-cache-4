Given {{the image of a}} face, five important parts (right and left eyes, nose, mouth and chin) are extracted and represented as appearance-based data vectors.

Several mixtures of classifiers based on (subsets of) these five <b>single</b> <b>parts</b> were designed using simple voting, weighted voting and other learner as combiners.

50|$|One of the {{advantages}} of stereolithography is its speed; functional parts can be manufactured within a day. The length of time it takes to produce a <b>single</b> <b>part</b> depends upon the complexity of the design and the size. Printing time can last anywhere from hours to more than a day. Many 3D printers can produce parts with a maximum size of approximately 50×50×60 cm (20×20×24 in) and some printers are capable of producing <b>single</b> <b>parts</b> more than 2 meters in length. 3D printed prototypes and designs are strong enough to be machined and {{can also be used to}} make master patterns for injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding, and various metal casting processes.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new superquadrics based object {{representation}} strategy for automotive parts in this paper. Starting from a 3 D watertight surface model, a part decomposition step is first performed to segment the original multi-part objects into their constituent <b>single</b> <b>parts.</b> Each <b>single</b> <b>part</b> is then {{represented by a}} superquadric. The originalities of this approach include first, our approach can represent complicated shapes, e. g., multi-part objects, by utilizing part decomposition as a preprocessing step. Second, superquadrics recovered using our approach have the highest confidence and accuracy due to the 3 D watertight surfaces utilized. A novel, generic 3 D part decomposition algorithm based on curvature analysis is also proposed in this paper. The proposed part decomposition algorithm is generic and flexible due to the popularity of triangle meshes in the 3 D computer community. The proposed algorithms were tested on a large set of 3 D data and experimental results are presented. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed part decomposition algorithm can segment complicated shapes, in our case automotive parts, efficiently into meaningful <b>single</b> <b>parts.</b> And our proposed superquadric representation strategy can then represent each part (if possible) of the complicated objects successfully...|$|R
