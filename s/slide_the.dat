5|$|Cross-country skiing has {{two basic}} {{propulsion}} techniques, which apply to different surfaces: classic (undisturbed snow and tracked snow) and skate skiing (firm, smooth snow surfaces). The classic technique {{relies on a}} wax or texture on the ski bottom under the foot for traction on the snow to allow the skier to <b>slide</b> <b>the</b> other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle {{from each other in}} a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain. A variety of turns are used, when descending.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to {{even look at}} the applications. With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to <b>slide</b> <b>the</b> boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 2007, a Class 73 derailed {{after hitting}} an {{avalanche}} between Hallingskeid and Myrdal on the Bergen Line. The accident {{raised questions about}} the class's abilities to handle hard snow, such as in avalanches. In particular, a DNV report from 1999 had shown that the train could act as a sled, lose contact with the tracks and slide on top of the snow. A former NSB employee who worked with route planning, stated that a locomotive-hauled train would be better suitable for such situations, because more of the weight is located {{at the front of the}} train, and it will therefore plow instead of <b>slide.</b> <b>The</b> National Rail Administration said that they took extra precautions for the Class 73 trains and that during snowfall they would run a snow-clearing unit ahead of all Class 73 runs. NSB stated that they would consider the possibility of reverting to conventional trains, but that unless new information could shed light on the situation, they would retain use of the Class 73 trains.|$|E
5000|$|The pistol is {{disassembled}} {{by removing}} the magazine, cocking the hammer and putting the safety in the [...] "safe" [...] position. A notch inside {{the front of the}} trigger guard at <b>the</b> frame must <b>slide</b> down and be held in position while moving <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> slightly forward and then up to detach it from the frame. The barrel can now be removed from <b>the</b> <b>slide.</b> To reassemble <b>the</b> pistol, insert the barrel back in <b>the</b> <b>slide.</b> Place <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> into <b>the</b> guides in the frame.

50|$|In 1960, Rollei {{introduced}} its first <b>slide</b> projector, <b>the</b> P11. It included two <b>slide</b> trays: <b>the</b> left-hand tray was for 35 mm (5 cm×5 cm) <b>slides,</b> <b>the</b> right-hand tray was for medium format (7 cm×7 cm) <b>slides.</b> <b>The</b> Rollei Universal Projector sold for 398.60 DM, plus 97.50 DM for a standard lens. The P11 remained in production until 1978; many more projectors were subsequently {{added to the}} range, providing a major boost to Rollei's turnover.|$|R

5|$|In September 1990, John Carmack, a game {{programmer}} for the Gamer's Edge {{video game}} subscription service and disk magazine at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana, developed {{a way to}} create graphics which could smoothly scroll in any direction in a computer game. At the time, IBM-compatible general-purpose computers {{were not able to}} replicate the common feat of video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, which were capable of redrawing the entire screen fast enough for a side-scrolling video game due to their specialized hardware. Carmack created adaptive tile refresh: a way to <b>slide</b> <b>the</b> majority of the visible screen to the side both horizontally and vertically when the player moved as if it had not changed, and only redraw the newly-visible portions of the screen. Other games had previously redrawn the whole screen in chunks, or like Carmack's earlier games were limited to scrolling in one direction. He discussed the idea with coworker Tom Hall, who encouraged him to demonstrate it by recreating the first level of the recent Super Mario Bros. 3 on a computer. The pair did so in a single overnight session, with Hall recreating the graphics of the game—replacing the player character of Mario with Dangerous Dave, a character from an eponymous previous Gamer's Edge game—while Carmack optimized the code. The next morning on September 20, the resulting game, Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement, was shown to their other coworker John Romero. Romero recognized Carmack's idea as a major accomplishment: Nintendo {{was one of the most}} successful companies in Japan, largely due to the success of their Mario franchise, and the ability to replicate the gameplay of the series on a computer could have large implications.|$|E
5|$|United {{responded with}} their first {{extended}} period of possession of the half, working the ball into wide areas to be crossed into the middle, but Rooney's first couple of attempted centres were well cleared by Piqué. At the third attempt, though, Rooney's cross evaded the Barcelona defence as Touré kicked at thin air; however, it also failed to find a Manchester United player in the penalty area, both Ronaldo and Park going close. After Ronaldo was called offside in the 59thminute – despite appearing to be level with the last defender – Giggs stole the ball mid-way inside the Barcelona half before playing the ball to Ronaldo on the left wing. The Portuguese forward stepped over the ball several times {{in an attempt to}} wrong-foot Puyol, before cutting inside and playing the ball across the edge of the area towards Carrick. A sliding challenge from Busquets prevented a shot, only for the English midfielder to <b>slide</b> <b>the</b> ball out for a Barcelona goal kick while attempting to play Rooney through. Rooney was again played down the right wing a few moments later, but his low cross was diverted behind by Piqué, and the resulting corner came to nothing. A left-wing attack from Ronaldo followed, but after cutting inside, he gave the ball away cheaply. Barcelona immediately went on the attack down the other end, but Henry was unable to get past O'Shea and his shot was well saved by Van der Sar low at the near post.|$|E

25|$|On September 30, 2012, a 19-year-old man {{fell from}} the Venom Drop water slide. According to a {{spokesperson}} for the water park, the man cut in line at <b>the</b> <b>slide,</b> fought through <b>the</b> lifeguards, and jumped onto <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> head-first. <b>The</b> man tumbled onto <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> and slipped over the edge, falling 60 feet onto a fence below <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> tower. <b>The</b> local sheriff's office reported that the man was transported to an area hospital with life-threatening injuries.|$|R
25|$|When the rower {{reaches the}} sternmost {{point of the}} <b>slide,</b> <b>the</b> end of the recovery, and the shins are vertical, the blade is quickly and {{smoothly}} dropped into the water by a slight lifting of the hands. This is called the catch.|$|E
25|$|The DS {{models are}} double action only pistols: the hammer doesn't stay cocked. Therefore the hammer spur has been removed, and is {{flush with the}} rear of the <b>slide.</b> <b>The</b> safety levers serve as manual safeties only and have no {{decocking}} feature..|$|E
25|$|While {{continuing}} to <b>slide</b> <b>the</b> seat forward, the rower rotates the oar handle(s), causing {{the face of}} the blade to be perpendicular to the water. This is called squaring or rolling up the blade. This, depending on the rower's technique, begins approximately when the oar handle(s) pass over the ankles.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{locking piece}} {{stopped by the}} tab, the rollers will {{continue}} rearward with <b>the</b> <b>slide,</b> until they reach the recessed portion of the locking piece.

50|$|As {{the return}} spring returns <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> forward, <b>the</b> breech face strips a round from the {{magazine}} {{into the chamber}} and the locking system engages the barrel and locks it with <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> in <b>the</b> battery position. A safety lever {{on the left side}} of the frame can be engaged by turning it into a notch on <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> to immobilize <b>the</b> <b>slide.</b> A disconnector system will also prevent the weapon from firing until the whole action is fully closed.|$|R
25|$|The Tiger Cub Den {{became an}} {{integrated}} {{part of the}} pack in 2001 and the standard blue uniform was adopted with Tiger Cub hat, neckerchief and <b>slide.</b> <b>The</b> Tiger Cub strip {{was replaced by the}} diamond shaped badge and the Tiger Cub Promise was replaced by the Cub Scout Promise.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the slots}} are {{slightly}} {{longer than the}} biscuits, {{it is still possible}} to <b>slide</b> <b>the</b> panels sideways after the joint is assembled (before the glue sets). This fact makes the biscuit joiner easy to use, because it does not require extreme accuracy or jigs to achieve perfect joints.|$|E
25|$|The FS has an {{enlarged}} hammer pin that fits into a groove {{on the underside}} of the <b>slide.</b> <b>The</b> main purpose is to stop the slide from flying off the frame to the rear if it cracks. This was in response to reported defective slides during U.S. Military testing.|$|E
40|$|The Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) {{technique}} {{with high}} precision and spatial resolution is a suitable sensor for flow field experiments. In this paper, the PIV technology {{was used to}} monitor {{the development of a}} displacement field, velocity field and acceleration field of a rock slide. It was found that the peak acceleration of <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> surface appeared earlier than the peak acceleration of <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> body. <b>The</b> characteristics of <b>the</b> rock <b>slide</b> including <b>the</b> short failure time, high velocities, and large accelerations indicate that <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> forces and energy release rate of the slope are high. The deformation field showed that <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> body was <b>sliding</b> outwards along <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> surface while <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> bed moved in an opposite direction. Moving upwards at the top of <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> bed {{can be one of the}} warning signs for rock slide failure...|$|R
50|$|On May 20 2017, another huge slide covered about 1/3 mi of {{road with}} 40 ft {{of dirt and}} rock. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> was on {{a section of the}} road that was already closed due to smaller <b>slides.</b> <b>The</b> scale of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> was {{compared}} to a very large <b>slide</b> during <b>the</b> winter of 1983-1984 that closed SR 1 for more than a year.|$|R
5000|$|Because sliding mode {{control laws}} are not continuous, it {{has the ability to}} drive trajectories to <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> mode in finite time (i.e., {{stability}} of <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> surface is better than asymptotic). However, once the trajectories reach <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> surface, <b>the</b> system takes on the character of <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> mode (e.g., <b>the</b> origin [...] may only have asymptotic stability on this surface).|$|R
25|$|Produced from 1989 to 1998, the Model 5904 has an {{aluminum}} alloy frame and blued steel <b>slide.</b> <b>The</b> Model 5903 was manufactured from 1990 to 1997, and featured {{an aluminum}} alloy frame and {{a stainless steel}} <b>slide.</b> <b>The</b> Model 5905 was a very limited version, with a blued steel frame and slide. It was manufactured only in 1992, and in very low volume. The 5906 is an all stainless steel model, hence it is noticeably heavier than the others. It was produced from 1989 to 1999. The stainless steel double-action only variant of this pistol, the Model 5946, along with the Model 3953, produced from 1990 to 1999, was manufactured without safety levers, and is the primary issue service pistol of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, British Columbia Sheriff Service, and one of three pistols available for selection by New York City Police Department.|$|E
25|$|Typically, a pinion-operated rack moving {{parallel}} to the (trig.-defined) opposite side would position a slide with a slot coincident with the hypotenuse. A pivot on the rack let the slide's angle change freely. At {{the other end of}} the <b>slide</b> (<b>the</b> angle, in trig, terms), a block on a pin fixed to the frame defined the vertex between the hypotenuse and the adjacent side.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{polymers}} {{also contain}} an internal stress.

25|$|The 92 FS Centennial {{limited edition}} (500 units) commemorates {{adoption}} by the Italian Military of Beretta's earliest semiautomatic pistol, the Model 1915. This Centennial 92 is notable for its frame-mounted manual safety and single-action-only mechanism. The Beretta medallion in each wood grip panel displays the anniversary dates in Roman numerals, {{which are also}} engraved {{on either side of}} the steel <b>slide.</b> <b>The</b> pistol is packaged in a custom M2A1 ammunition can bearing the Centennial logo.|$|E
25|$|The pistol {{is fired}} {{by a single}} action hammer, and has a manual safety switch on the <b>slide.</b> <b>The</b> ambidextrous safety switch rotates a drum {{mechanism}} which sits over the firing pin, causing the firing pin to lock in, which prevents it from moving forward and reduces {{the possibility of the}} gun discharging accidentally. With the safety off, pulling the trigger releases the hammer to fall downward, hitting the firing pin and causing the chambered round to discharge.|$|E
25|$|Single or two story wood-frame {{domestic}} structures {{built on}} a perimeter or slab foundation are relatively safe in an earthquake, but in many structures built before 1950 the sill plate that sits between the concrete foundation and the floor diaphragm (perimeter foundation) or studwall (slab foundation) may not be sufficiently bolted in.
