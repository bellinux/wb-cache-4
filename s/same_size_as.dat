5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy {{may be the}} <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> the Milky Way but has {{a visible}} star count of only 1% of the Milky Way. The lack of {{luminosity}} is {{because there is a}} lack of star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E
5|$|Haumea (43.13AU average) is in {{an orbit}} similar to Makemake except {{that it is in}} a 7:12 orbital {{resonance}} with Neptune. It is about the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> Makemake and has two natural satellites. A rapid, 3.9-hour rotation gives it a flattened and elongated shape. It was named and designated a dwarf planet in 2008.|$|E
5|$|MF Skarnsund II was the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> Ytterøy, {{had placed}} for 30 cars and was bi-directional. She cost NOK27 million {{and was in}} service from 1987 to 1991, when she was sold to Namsos Trafikkselskap for NOK23 million. The 330tonne vessel was built by Trønderverftet.|$|E

50|$|The {{hypoglossal}} canal {{has recently}} been {{used to try to}} determine the antiquity of human speech. Researchers have found that hominids who lived as long as 2 million years ago had the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> canal <b>as</b> that of modern-day chimpanzees; some scientists thus assume they were incapable of speech. However, archaic H. sapiens 400,000 years ago had the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> canal <b>as</b> that of modern humans, meaning they could have been capable of speech. Some Neanderthals also had the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> hypoglossal canal <b>as</b> archaic H. sapiens. However recent studies involving several primate species have failed to find conclusive evidence of a relationship between its size and speech.|$|R
5|$|MF Skarnsund was the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> Innherredsferja II and was {{put into}} service on the Skarnsund route in 1969. She had {{capacity}} for sixteen cars and was built in Kristiansund for NOK1,555,000. In 1982, she was replaced by Mosvik and was leased to Namsos Trafikkselskap. She was sold for NOK1 in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Males have {{relatively}} small testes {{compared to other}} lemurs, and their canine teeth are the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> those seen in females. During the dry season, females can weigh more than males. Both patterns of sexual dimorphism {{are consistent with the}} theory of sexual selection for monogamous species and female dominance respectively. Females have two pairs of nipples.|$|E
5|$|Scholarly {{estimates}} {{of the size of}} the 4th-century army diverge widely, ranging from ca. 400,000 to over one million effectives (i.e. from roughly the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> the 2nd-century army to 2 or 3 times larger). This is due to fragmentary evidence, unlike the much better-documented 2nd-century army.|$|E

A 25 ft tower was standard for the smallest three sizes and the largere sizes came with a 35 ft as standard. Again, a taller tower could be supplied at extra cost. The geared Simplex engines were turned into wind by a fantail.|$|R

5|$|The Mark III {{telescope}} was the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> the Mark II, but was constructed to be transportable. However, {{it was never}} moved, and remained at its original site in Wardle, near Nantwich, where it was used as part of MERLIN. It was built in 1966, and was decommissioned in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The carrot is a diploid species, and {{has nine}} {{relatively}} short, uniform-length chromosomes (2n=18). The genome size {{is estimated to}} be 473 mega base pairs, which is four times larger than Arabidopsis thaliana, one-fifth the size of the maize genome, and about the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> the rice genome.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{view of a}} {{much larger}} 4th century army has fallen out of favour with some historians in more recent times, as existing evidence has been reappraised and new evidence uncovered. The revisionist view is that the 4th-century army was, at its peak, roughly the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> the 2nd-century one and considerably smaller in the late 4th century.|$|E

5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of {{approximately}} the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. Only {{a small percentage of}} these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} from China to Britain {{for the first}} time. Superficially similar in appearance to an Aylesbury duck, a Pekin is white with orange legs and bill, with its legs near the rear, giving it an upright stance while on land. Although not thought {{to have such a}} delicate flavour as the Aylesbury, the Pekin was hardier, a more prolific layer, fattened more quickly, and was roughly the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> an Aylesbury at nine weeks.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the nine}} figures depicted, five are looking {{directly}} {{out at the}} royal couple or the viewer. Their glances, along with the king and queen's reflection, affirm the royal couple's presence outside the painted space. Alternatively, art historians H. W. Janson and Joel Snyder suggest {{that the image of}} the king and queen is a reflection from Velázquez's canvas, the front of which is obscured from the viewer. Other writers say the canvas Velázquez is painting is unusually large for a portrait by Velázquez, and is about the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> Las Meninas. Las Meninas contains the only known double portrait of the royal couple painted by Velázquez.|$|E

5|$|On {{the north}} side of the temple {{courtyard}} is the Manjusri Hall (文殊殿). It was constructed in 1137 during the Jin dynasty and is roughly the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> the East Hall, also measuring seven bays by four. It is located on an 83cm (2.7ft) high platform, has three front doors and one central back door, and features a single-eave hip gable roof. The interior of the hall has only four support pillars. In order to support the large roof, diagonal beams are used. On each of the four walls are murals of arhats painted in 1429 during the Ming dynasty.|$|E
5|$|T. m. propinquus breeds from {{southeast}} British Columbia, southern Alberta, southwest Saskatchewan {{south to}} southern California and northern Baja California. It winters {{throughout much of}} the southern breeding range and south to Baja California. It is the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> or slightly larger than nominate T. m. migratorius, but paler and tinged more heavily brownish-gray. It has very little white on the tip of the outermost tail feather. Some birds, probably females, lack almost any red below. Males are usually darker and may show pale or whitish sides to the head.|$|E
5|$|The Programmer {{accessory}} {{had been}} {{mentioned in the}} earliest advertisement {{but it was not}} featured until March 1974. This was the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> a desktop calculator and could hold 256 programming steps. (It could be expanded to 512 steps.) It was limited to emulating calculator key presses and simple sequence branching. The programming was done by entering hexadecimal key codes. The combination of the MITS 7440 calculator and the programmer was not nearly as sophisticated as the HP 9830 calculator but $400 for both kits was a fraction of the HP price.|$|E
50|$|On {{graduating from}} the Royal College of Art, Joffe painted 24 {{paintings}} in 24 hours at the Chisenhale Gallery in 1999, each canvas was 12 feet by 6 feet. In 2000 he repeated the feat in Milan at Laura Pecci Gallery, although this time the paintings were a variety of sizes. In 2003 he did 72 paintings in 72 hours at Brno House of Arts in the Czech Republic. The canvases this time being the <b>same</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>as</b> Goya painted between 1789 and 1815.|$|R
50|$|Ni-Cd {{cells are}} {{available}} in the <b>same</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>as</b> alkaline batteries, from AAA through D, as well <b>as</b> several multi-cell <b>sizes,</b> including the equivalent of a 9 volt battery. A fully charged single Ni-Cd cell, under no load, carries a potential difference of between 1.25 and 1.35 volts, which stays relatively constant as the battery is discharged. Since an alkaline battery near fully discharged may see its voltage drop to as low as 0.9 volts, Ni-Cd cells and alkaline cells are typically interchangeable for most applications.|$|R
50|$|Sealed Ni-Cd cells {{may be used}} individually, or {{assembled}} into {{battery packs}} containing two or more cells. Small cells are used for portable electronics and toys (such as solar garden lights), often using cells manufactured in the <b>same</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>as</b> primary cells. When Ni-Cd batteries are substituted for primary cells, the lower terminal voltage and smaller ampere-hour capacity may reduce performance as compared to primary cells. Miniature button cells are sometimes used in photographic equipment, hand-held lamps (flashlight or torch), computer-memory standby, toys, and novelties.|$|R
5|$|The {{editorial}} work was largely done by Sloane, but Gernsback retained final say over the fiction content. Two consultants, Conrad A. Brandt and Wilbur C. Whitehead, were hired {{to help find}} fiction to reprint. Frank R. Paul, {{who had worked with}} Gernsback as early as 1914, became the cover artist; Paul had produced many illustrations for the fiction in The Electrical Experimenter. Amazing was issued in the large bedsheet format, 8.5 × 11.75 in (216 × 298mm), the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> the technical magazines. It was an immediate success and by the following March reached a circulation of 150,000.|$|E
5|$|The unique deep-sky object {{known as}} Hanny's Voorwerp was {{discovered}} in Leo Minor in 2007 by Dutch school teacher Hanny van Arkel while participating as a volunteer in the Galaxy Zoo project. Lying near the 650-million-light-year-distant spiral galaxy IC2497, it is around the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> the Milky Way. It contains a 16,000-light-year-wide hole. The voorwerp {{is thought to be}} the visual light echo of a quasar now gone inactive, possibly as recently as 200,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|According to Expanded Universe material, the {{peaceful}} Mon Calamari converted their passenger liners into warships {{to support the}} rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Expanded Universe texts state that the ships are crewed almost entirely by Mon Calamari due to the ships' Mon Calamari-oriented controls and interface. The primary opponent of Mon Calamari cruisers are the Imperial Star Destroyers. Although Mon Calamari cruisers are roughly the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> most Imperial Destroyers, in head-to-head engagements the Mon Calamari cruisers are usually at a disadvantage, due to their thinner armor. Even so, Mon Calamari cruisers are still a formidable threat to the Imperial fleet; their large numbers of fighter squadrons, modular weapons systems and overlapping shields make them ideal for hit-and-run attacks on Imperial ships, bases, and military outposts.|$|E
