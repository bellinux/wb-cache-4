His second came after he won a penalty which he converted to secure the victory. His efforts in this game won him Goal.com's World Player of the Week Award.

5|$|The Tagora was priced {{to overlap}} with {{high-end}} Peugeot 505 and low-end Citroën CX models, while <b>slotting</b> in beneath the Peugeot 604. Its pricing was also {{comparable to the}} Renault 20/30 and Ford Granada. The Tagora was in the 20,000–30,000 Deutschmark bracket in Germany. During the first fifteen months of the car's existence, in 1980/81, a mere 16,169 Tagoras were produced which was only one quarter of Chrysler's initial projections. Sales proved insufficient even for this production level, and volumes plummeted by more than 80 percent in 1982. In 1983 the sales figures prompted PSA to cancel the model altogether. By the time the Tagora was discontinued, only about 20,000 had been built; by comparison, over 116,000 Peugeot 505s and 74,000 Citroën CXs were made in 1981 alone.|$|E

Mark Hughes scored a third for United to leave the game drawn 3–3 and requiring a replay. In the replay the Eagles wore a new one-off yellow and black striped shirt because the club {{did not have time}} to find their away strip.

Earlier in the session, he had suffered a spin in turn four that flat-spotted his tyres and sent him back to the pitlane. Rosberg managed only third fastest as the Mercedes drivers were split by Sebastian Vettel, even though the latter suffered from electrical problems that lost him track time. Rosberg in turn was unable to improve on his time set on the soft-compound tyre due to his super-soft run being compromised by yellow flags shown after a spin by Romain Grosjean. Behind the top three, Kimi Räikkönen was again fourth, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas.

Reporting to the Canucks' {{training camp in}} September 2006, his play had the Canucks <b>slotting</b> him in as the team's seventh defenseman. However, a hip injury saw him assigned to the Manitoba Moose. Following an injury to Canucks defenseman Sami Salo, he was called up to the NHL on 3 November 2006, two games into his AHL season. He made his NHL debut the following day against the Colorado Avalanche. Eleven days later, however, he was reassigned to the Moose, only to be recalled on 24 November. He scored his first NHL goal on 30 November, a slap shot that beat Anaheim Ducks goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère in a 2–1 loss. Edler was reassigned between Manitoba and Vancouver on several more occasions {{over the course of}} the 2006–07 season. He appeared in 22 games total for the Canucks, recording a goal and two assists. With the Moose, he scored five goals and 26 points over 49 games and was named Manitoba's Rookie of the Year.|$|E

However, the Cats fell short and Hawthorn held on to win one of the toughest Grand Finals of the modern era by 6 points. Ablett's performance in kicking 9 goals earned him the Norm Smith Medal, and in doing so became only the second member of the losing team in VFL/AFL history to be awarded the honour – a performance regarded by many as unrivalled on football's biggest stage.

Sturridge continued to show his ability with a real poacher's effort in a 2–0 victory in the FA Cup against Preston North End, scoring his third goal for Chelsea in January. On 13 February, he netted again against Cardiff City, as Chelsea won 4–1. Sturridge scored his first League goal for Chelsea on 25 April 2010, in a 7–0 victory over Stoke City at Stamford Bridge, by latching onto a through ball, before rounding goalkeeper Asmir Begović and <b>slotting</b> the ball home. During the 2010 FA Cup Final, he came on as a 90th-minute substitute for Chelsea as they won 1–0 against Portsmouth. Sturridge finished the 2009–10 FA Cup campaign as the leading scorer for Chelsea with four goals.|$|E
25|$|The {{draw for}} {{the second round of}} the FA Trophy was made on 14 December 2009, with Stevenage being handed another home tie, this time against Conference North side Vauxhall Motors.

After the break, David Bridges scored twice in quick succession, before Andy Drury hit a {{swerving}} drive from 25 yards and Stacy Long scored his first goal in Borough colours with a neat chip. The victory means Stevenage face Conference South outfit Dover Athletic at Broadhall Way on 30 January. Stevenage won the match 41. The visitors took the lead mid-way through the first-half courtesy of Shaun Welford's close range effort. Shortly after, Borough equalised through Tim Sills, his first goal for the Hertfordshire side, who threw himself at Chris Beardsley's cross to restore parity.

A series of measurement on two hardware prototypes (proposed post <b>slot</b> and conventional shunt <b>slot</b> array antennas) has been conducted in an indoor anechoic chamber.
