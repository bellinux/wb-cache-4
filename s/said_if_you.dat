500|$|In {{the opening}} scene, Evelyn Powell (Rebecca Wisocky) gives her maid Flora (Paula Garces) the {{following}} warning [...] "I {{think what you}} people do is heroic... You wash clothes you can't afford. You polish silver you will never dine with.... I am in awe of your determination to succeed in this great country of ours. That <b>said,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't stop screwing my husband, I'm {{going to have you}} deported." [...] Subsequently, a season-long story arc around which the show revolves begins with Flora's murder.|$|E
500|$|Audiences also {{responded to}} the Beatles' brash social impudence. Director Richard Lester said, [...] "The general aim of the film was to present what was {{apparently}} becoming a social phenomenon in this country. Anarchy is too strong a word, but the quality of confidence that the boys exuded! Confidence that they could dress as they liked, speak as they liked, talk to the Queen as they liked, {{talk to the people}} on the train who 'fought the war for them' as they liked. ... still based on privilege—privilege by schooling, privilege by birth, privilege by accent, privilege by speech. The Beatles were the first people to attack this… they <b>said</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want something, do it. You can do it. Forget all this talk about talent or ability or money or speech. Just do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The actress also {{recounted the}} story to Alan Mercer of Dazzling Diva.com, saying: [...] "I told them I don't want any more money. I just want to direct one episode {{in the next two}} year cycle. I didn't think that was so horrible. I didn't want to direct six episodes. They still said no. Basically, I was fired at the end of year eight. So, I said good-bye, and Larry said 'see you next season.' I told him I won't be coming back. He said, [...] "What!?!" [...] I told him, [...] "They fired me because I want to direct one episode, and if that's their stance, I'm out of here." [...] He was stunned and he <b>said</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> go I go. He denies that to this day. He really went to bat for me." [...] Gray {{remained}} a member of the principal cast until she left the show in its twelfth season. Her departure came as a surprise, but her publicist said that after eleven years on the show, she wished to pursue other things.|$|E

2500|$|... 2007 – In {{an episode}} of the daytime soap opera The Young and the Restless (broadcast January and February 2007 in Canada and the USA), when Colleen Carlton copies {{scrambled}} letters obtained from the Grugeon Reliquary onto a dry board, Professor Adrian Korbel jokingly asks if she's testing the Infinite Monkey Theorem. When asked what this is, he replies: [...] "Thomas Henry Huxley <b>said</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> gave keyboards to an infinite amount of monkeys, and gave said monkeys an infinite amount of time… Well {{it is safe to}} say…you are not the magic monkey." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} Ramblin' Jack Elliott studied {{extensively}} under Guthrie, visiting {{his home and}} observing how he wrote and performed. Elliott, like Bob Dylan later, idolized Guthrie and was inspired by his idiomatic performance style and repertoire. Because of Guthrie's Huntington's disease, Dylan and Guthrie's son Arlo later claimed they learned much of Guthrie's performance style from Elliott. When asked about Arlo's claim, Elliott said, [...] "I was flattered. Dylan learned from me the same way I learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. He just <b>said,</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want to learn something, just steal it—that's the way I learned from Lead Belly." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the subject}} of his religion, Hawke {{previously}} wrote, while attending the 1952 World Christian Youth Conference in India, that [...] "there were all these poverty stricken kids at the gate of this palatial place where we were feeding our face and I just had this struck by this enormous sense of irrelevance of religion to the needs of people". He subsequently abandoned his Christian beliefs. By the time he entered politics he was a self-described agnostic. Hawke told Andrew Denton in 2008 that his father's Christian faith had continued to influence his outlook, saying [...] "My father <b>said</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> believe in the fatherhood of God you must necessarily believe in the brotherhood of man, it follows necessarily, and even though I left the church and was not religious, that truth remained with me." ...|$|E

In {{one of her}} interviews to Filmfare magazine in 2012 Begum dislosed [...] "The more hits I gave, the less work I got. When I helped new composers I never told them to give me all their songs to sing. I believed only God could give, not them." [...] Her final interview was in 2012. In 2009, she was conferred with the prestigious O. P. Nayyar award for her contribution to Hindi film music. She was also conferred the Padma Bhushan in 2009. Later her daughter Usha {{said in an interview}} [...] ""Because of the politics in the industry, she didn't want to work any more. This {{is one of the reasons}} why she didn't let me be a singer. I told her, let me sing for my self-satisfaction, but she <b>said</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will learn to sing, you will directly enter the industry. So, she didn't let me do so." ...|$|E
