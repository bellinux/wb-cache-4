The degradation rate of materials with different characteristics was also analysed. The synthesis procedure used, powder grain size, silver oxide addition, sintering conditions and final density were all considered as possible factors affecting the material's <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>ageing.</b> The transport critical current was measured using the d. c. four probe technique, with and without magnetic field, on wire specimens, and with an a. c. contactless method with no field on moulded rings.

The article places also special emphasis on presenting the weaknesses of the old pension system (running before 1 January 1999) like for example <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> society, political decisions or lack of law transparency. The new pension system was established on 1 January 1999. The system consists of three pillars. Two of them are mandatory and one is voluntary.

The pension system no longer encourages to hide income or to retire before reaching the pensionable age. However, only some of the problems were eliminated. The system is still sensitive to manipulations and there are no fixed law regulations. Zadanie pt.

40|$|International audienceWe {{demonstrate}} in {{this paper}} the influence of surface finish on the ageing kinetics of biomedical grade zirconia. The critical influence of polishing has been systematically investigated by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The stress state around polishing scratches gives rise to preferential transformation in the zone of the induced scratches and consequently to accelerated ageing. The influence of residual stresses is analyzed semi-quantitatively by preparing samples with various surface finish, thus with various stress states. Rough polishing produces a compressive surface stress layer beneficial for the ageing resistance, while smooth polishing produces preferential transformation nucleation around scratches. When a thermal treatment of 2 h at 1200 °C is applied to relax the residual stresses, all the surfaces states exhibit the same <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>ageing.</b> These results demonstrate that roughness alone cannot be used for ensuring a long-term stability. The variation of ageing sensitivity is indeed related indirectly to the surface roughness via the induced surface stress state. The current ISO standards {{are not able to}} take these effects into account. Indeed, great variations in ageing kinetics were observed for samples with different surface states, although all well below the ISO requirements...|$|E

In the present study, a pretreatment with a daily 6 min exposure to IR 1072 for 10 days yielded a number of significant behavioral effects on middle-aged female CD- 1 mice (12 -months) tested in a 3 D-maze. Middle-aged mice show significant deficits in a working memory test and IR treatment reversed this deficit. Interestingly, the IR treated middle-aged group despite making less memory errors than sham middle-aged group spent longer time {{in different parts of the}} maze than both the young group (3 -months) and sham-middle-aged group (12 -months). Young mice appeared more anxious than middle-aged mice in the first sessions of the test. Exposure to IR appeared to have no significant effects upon exploratory activity or anxiety responses. However, it elicited significant effects on working memory, with the IR middle-aged mice being more considerate in their decision making, which results in an overall improved cognitive performance which is comparable to that of young CD- 1 mice.

40|$|Laminated {{glass is}} for a few decades a {{well-known}} product {{in the construction industry}} for conferring safety performances to glazing units. Besides to the safeguarding of persons, laminated glass products are contributing to a variety of other safety performances, in case of accidental or attack situations leading to breakage of or crack propagation in the glass panes of a laminated glass unit. The ultimate residual load-bearing capacity of a damaged element can be resumed to one critical load-transfer mechanism, in the form of interlayer ligaments bridging the glass fragments. The characterization for design purposes of the mechanical properties of the interlayer involved in this load-transfer mechanism through the ligament appears however far from obvious. This results from specificities on the one hand of adhesive polymer components and on the other of design and control processes in the building industry. These specificities are mainly related to two aspects : firstly to the time- and temperature dependent behaviour of interlayer materials and their possible <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> effects, and secondly to initially vaguely defined intended fields of use, especially when non-conventional structural applications are within the considered application scope. The combination of these two aspects raises constraints for the development of experimental methods, test configurations and assessment strategies for laminated glass products. This research proposes analysis grids to get an overview of the constitutive elements of application scopes and of the possibilities and limitations for experimental assessment, with purpose to distinguish and estimate different types of border effects. These are used to evaluate the representativeness and the robustness of different test methods and test configurations, corresponding to different experimental scales. An incremental experimental approach has been developed for investigating the time- and temperature dependent performances of damaged laminated glass elements, on the basis of tests on pre-cracked specimens of small dimensions. The assessment of the residual load-bearing capacity of damaged elements used in structural applications was the main focus of these investigations. This research highlights the need for adapting experimental assessment approaches to characterize properties of laminated glass products for design purposes with respect to their post-fracture performances, in comparison with other construction materials. It also explains specific difficulties for obtaining quantitatively meaningful results and the challenges for harmonizing experimental assessment strategies for different applications and products made with a same type of interlayer material...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{elaborate}} and characterize zirconia toughened alumina composites with different microstructures, using a simple process. These composites are obtained by colloidal process and are dedicated to orthopedic application. ZTA composites offer both higher strength and toughness than alumina, a lower <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> than zirconia, and also a proven biocompatibility. They {{open the door to}} component designs not reachable with other, more brittle materials. Nowadays, these composites are the safest for orthopedic implants application, but can still be improved. The first part of our study is dedicated to a numerical modeling of a large femoral head during sintering. It is so possible to obtain a realistic model of thermal and mechanical strain gradient. However, the modeling should be enhanced by a thorough study of the elastic-viscous-plastic behavior of the composite at high temperature. Then some experiments of sintering with various load or pressure and speed should be practice to determine precisely the sintering related strain. The possibility of machining in the pre-sintered state, with the aim of reducing machining costs and simplify the process of large components, is investigated. The second part is focused on the development of various microstructures with specific mechanical properties and reinforcement behaviors. Such structures were achieved by adjusting the amount of zirconia, controlling the grain growth with dopants to improve or inhibit the alumina grain growth (Si, Ca and Mg), and by adjusting the sintering thermal treatment. The use of calcium associated or not with magnesium seems useless as compared to the predominant influence of the zirconia content. Adjusting zirconia amount led to micro-composites (1500 °C) and nano-composites (25 vol% of zirconia and 1500 °C) et nano/nano-composites (25 vol% de zircone et T < 1500 °C). Seul l’ajout conjoint de Si et de Ca pour des échantillons contenant 2, 5 vol% de zircone permet de conduire à des micro/nano-composites avec une grande proportion de zircone intragranulaire. Les observations sur des composites avec un taux de zircone proche du taux de percolation (16 vol%) permettent de mettre en évidence l’ensemble des types de renforcement observés dans la littérature, en fonction de la température et des dopants utilisés.

40|$|Ageing is {{characterized}} by declines {{on a variety of}} cognitive measures. These declines are often attributed to a general, unitary underlying cause, such as a reduction in executive function owing to atrophy of the prefrontal cortex.

Here we address this in a large (N= 567), population-based sample drawn from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) data. We relate fluid intelligence and multitasking to multiple brain measures, including grey matter in various prefrontal regions and white matter integrity connecting those regions.

We also found strong functional connectivity between the ACC and lateral PFC and observed that activation of the lateral PFC was qualitatively different over time in different age groups.

The protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) combats protein misfolding resulting from L-isoaspartyl formation by catalyzing the conversion of abnormal L-isoaspartyl residues to their normal L-aspartyl forms. In this way, the PIMT repair enzyme system contributes to longevity and survival in bacterial and animal kingdoms. Despite the discovery of PIMT activity in plants two decades ago, the role of this enzyme during plant stress adaptation and in seed longevity remains undefined.

The HYDI method is extremely versatile and {{data were analyzed}} using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), and q-space imaging approaches. Twenty-four females and 23 males between 18 and 55 years of age were included in this study. The impact of age and sex on diffusion metrics were tested using least squares linear regressions in 48 white matter regions of interest (ROIs) across the whole brain and adjusted for multiple comparisons across ROIs. In this study, white matter projections to either the hippocampus or the cerebral cortices were the brain regions most sensitive <b>to</b> <b>aging.</b> Specifically, in this young <b>to</b> middle-aged cohort, <b>aging</b> effects were associated with more dispersion of white matter fibers while the tissue restriction and intra-axonal volume fraction remained relatively stable. The fiber dispersion index of NODDI exhibited the most pronounced <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>aging.</b> In addition, changes of the DTI indices in this aging cohort were correlated mostly with the fiber dispersion index rather than the intracellular volume fraction of NODDI or the q-space measurements. While men and women did not differ in the aging rate, men tend to have higher intra-axonal volume fraction than women. This study demonstrates that advanced dMRI using a HYDI acquisition and compartmental modeling of NODDI can elucidate microstructural alterations that are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>age</b> and sex. Finally, this study provides insight into the relationships between DTI diffusion metrics and advanced diffusion metrics of NODDI model and q-space imaging...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{review of}} the {{literature}} demonstrates an association between noise and anger. It is hypothesised, however, that this association would not be the same for every subject, but depend on a large range of psychobiological differences between individuals, dependent on age, sex, and noise sensitivity of each subject. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate these eventual individual differences in how the subjective <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> noise is associated to different dimensions of anger in adolescents of different age and of both sexes. Methods: For this purpose two self-report instruments were chosen: the <b>Sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> Noise test (SENSIT) (Santisteban, 1990, 1992) and the State-Trait Anger expression Inventory (STAXI) (Spielberger, 1988). Results: showed: a) a globally significant correlationship between <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> noise and the different anger aspects: feelings (in anger state), temperament (in trait anger), and internal expression (in anger expression); and b) different characteristics according to the psychobiological peculiarities of each subject (subjective <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> noise, <b>age,</b> sex). Conclusions: in accordance to the hypothesis, the present result...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  2, there are {{distinct}} difference in structures of these OCV models. Some models are very simple with fewer numbers of parameters while some models are quite complicated with many parameters. Additionally, some models have {{limits on the}} SoC regions. In this section, we will give a comprehensive comparison and analysis on these OCV models, including the adaptabilities <b>to</b> battery types, <b>sensitivities</b> <b>to</b> temperatures, <b>aging</b> stages, SoC regions, numbers of data points, and impacts on SoC estimation. The fitted OCV should be as close to experimental OCV as possible. The fitting performance will be evaluated by the indicator of root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the experimental data and fitted data.|$|R
30|$|The key {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is using an innovative approach to give a systematic comparison on the practicality of diversified OCV models. First, adaptability of these OCV models to different battery types is investigated. Second, <b>sensitivities</b> <b>to</b> ambient temperatures, <b>aging</b> stages, numbers of data points, and SoC regions are studied. Third, the impacts of these models on SoC estimation are explored. Finally, suggestions about the selection of OCV models are given based on comparison analyses.|$|R
