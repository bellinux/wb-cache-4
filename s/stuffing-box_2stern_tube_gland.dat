40|$|Summary. CD 34 -positive stromal {{cells are}} {{distributed}} in various organs including breast, Fallopian <b>tubes,</b> thyroid <b>gland,</b> colon, pancreas, and uterine cervix. To elucidate {{the distribution of}} CD 34 -positive stromal cells, smooth muscle cells, and myofibroblasts in normal human testis, we examined 48 testes obtained by autopsy and operation, including five fetal, one neonatal, and 42 adult cases without evident testicular lesions, using a streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique. The expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA), h-caldesmon, CD 34, and CD 31 were immunohisto-chemically examined in all cases. The tunica albuginea and the inner layer of seminiferous tubules in adult testis were predominantly composed of myofibroblasts. Smooth muscle cells were also scattered throughout these sites in some cases. CD 34 -positive stromal cells were abundant, and they formed a reticular network around the seminiferous tubules and Leydig cells {{as well as the}} outer layer of seminiferous tubules. Moreover, myofibroblasts and the CD 34 reticular network were already present in the testicular stroma during fetal or neonatal development. Double immunostaining of fetal, neonatal and adult testes using ASMA and CD 34 confirmed that myofibroblasts and CD 34 -positive stromal cells were present in the inner and outer layers of peritubular tissue, respectively. This distribution and cytological identification was also confirmed by an ultrastructural study of four cases.

40|$|Neogenin, a close {{relative}} of the axon guidance receptor Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC), {{has been shown to}} be a receptor for members of the Netrin and Repulsive Guidance Molecule (RGM) families. While Netrin-l-Neogenin interactions result in a chernoattractive axon guidance response, the interaction between Neogenin and RGMa induces a chemorepulsive response. Evidence is now accumulating that Neogenin is a multi-functional receptor regulating many diverse developmental processes, including neural <b>tube</b> and mammary <b>gland</b> formation, myogenesis and angiogenesis. Little is known of the function of Neogenin in the adult, however, a novel role in the regulation of iron homeostasis is now emerging. While the signal transduction pathways activated by Neogenin are poorly understood, it is clear that the functional outcome of Neogenin activation, at least in the embryo, depends on both the developmental context as well as the nature of the ligand.

40|$|AbstractThe final overall {{shape of}} an organ and its {{position}} within the developing embryo arise {{as a consequence of}} both its intrinsic properties and its interactions with surrounding tissues. Here, we focus on the role of directed cell migration in shaping and positioning the Drosophila salivary gland. We demonstrate that the salivary gland turns and migrates along the visceral mesoderm to become properly oriented with respect to the overall embryo. We show that salivary gland posterior migration requires the activities of genes that position the visceral mesoderm precursors, such as heartless, thickveins, and tinman, but does not require a differentiated visceral mesoderm. We also demonstrate a role for integrin function in salivary gland migration. Although the mutations affecting salivary gland motility and directional migration cause defects in the final positioning of the salivary gland, most do not affect the length or diameter of the salivary <b>gland</b> <b>tube.</b> These findings suggest that salivary tube dimensions may be an intrinsic property of salivary gland cells...|$|R

40|$|Tubes {{form the}} basic {{structure}} of several organs like lungs, kidneys, glandular organs like the pancreas, mammary and salivary <b>glands.</b> <b>Tube</b> formation involves a series of dynamic and interdependent cellular processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization, assembly of intercellular junctional complexes, and cell polarization. Understanding how cells polarize and coordinate tubulogenesis during organ formation is a central question in biology. Tubulogenesis often coincides with cell lineage specification during organ development. Hence, an elementary question is whether these two processes are independently controlled, or whether proper cell specification depends on formation of tubes. To address these fundamental questions, we have studied the functional role of Cdc 42 in pancreatic tubulogenesis. We present evidence that Cdc 42 is essential for tube formation, specifically for initiating microlumen formation and later for maintaining apical cell polarity. Finally, we show that Cdc 42 controls cell specification non-cell-autonomously by providing the correct microenvironment for proper control of cell fate choices of multipotent progenitors. To understand the process and importance of endocrine cell delamination and migration from the ductal epithelium, we used transgenic mouse models expressing the dominant active Cdc 42 (Cdc 42 DA) or the dominant negative Rac 1 (Rac 1 DN) in the insulin cells. Active Cdc 42 enhanced E-cadherin and F-actin at the cell-cell contacts and blocked the delamination of newly formed insulin cells. The beta cell numbers were severely reduced and resulted in hyperglycemia. Expression of dominant negative Rac 1 did not affect the delamination but impaired the subsequent migration and organization of islet cells. E-cadherin was enhanced in the cell-cell contacts of the transgenic islet cells expressing Rac 1 DN. Our results describe the process of tube formation in glandular organs like pancreas and identified key regulators in the process. In addition, we show tube formation plays a crucial role in establishing correct microenvironment for proper cell fate specification. B...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. May 2013. Major: Integrated Biosciences. Advisor: Dr. Jennifer O. Liang. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 99 pages. Vertebrate nervous system development requires a complex {{series of events}} to transform a flat neuroepithelium into complex structures containing specialized cell types. The anterior neuroectoderm {{gives rise to the}} brain and is the origin for some of the first neurons that differentiate. It is also the origin of the cranial neural crest cells that form craniofacial features. This thesis focuses on the embryonic development of two tissues that arise from the zebrafish anterior neuroectoderm, the epithalamus, a region of the dorsal forebrain, and the mandible, the lower jaw. Early in development, the flat neural plate folds into a neural <b>tube.</b> The pineal <b>gland,</b> an organ involved with circadian rhythms, begins as two precursor domains at the lateral edges of the neural plate that converge into a single tissue when the neural tube closes. The pineal gland, along with the parapineal gland and habenula nuclei, form the epithalamus in the dorsal forebrain. In embryos with open neural tubes, {{the left and the right}} sides of the pineal and surrounding epithalamus are widely spaced. I found that despite this displacement, pineal cell types differentiate normally and initiate their rhythmic function. Conversely left-right asymmetry in the epithalamus was lost; both sides exhibited left-sided characteristics. Further, this loss of asymmetry in the epithalamus was correlated to severity in neural tube defects. Embryos with left isomerism had significantly wider pineal anlage domains than those with normal or reversed asymmetry. Cranial neural crest cells from the dorsal neural tube migrate to form craniofacial structures, including the cartilaginous precursor to the mandible, Meckel's cartilage. The bigtime (bti) mutant exhibits reductions in mandibular development. I found that although cranial neural crest cells localize normally to the lower jaw region in these mutants, they fail to differentiate into functional chondrocytes that secrete a sufficient amount of collagenous extracellular matrix...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Secretoglobin 1 A 1 (SCGB 1 A 1), {{also called}} Clara cell {{secretory}} protein, {{is the most}} abundantly secreted protein of the airway. The SCGB 1 A 1 gene has been characterized in mammals as a single copy in the genome. However, analysis of the equine genome suggested that horses might have multiple SCGB 1 A 1 gene copies. Non-ciliated lung epithelial cells produce SCGB 1 A 1 during inhalation of noxious substances to counter airway inflammation. Airway fluid and lung tissue of horses with recurrent airway obstruction (RAO), a chronic inflammatory lung disease affecting mature horses similar to environmentally induced asthma of humans, have reduced total SCGB 1 A 1 concentration. Herein, we investigated whether horses have distinct expressed SCGB 1 A 1 genes; whether the transcripts are differentially expressed in tissues and in inflammatory lung disease; and whether there is cell specific protein expression in tissues. Results We identified three SCGB 1 A 1 gene copies on equine chromosome 12, contained within a 512 -kilobase region. Bioinformatic analysis showed that SCGB 1 A 1 genes differ from each other by 8 to 10 nucleotides, and that they code for different proteins. Transcripts were detected for SCGB 1 A 1 and SCGB 1 A 1 A, but not for SCGB 1 A 1 P. The SCGB 1 A 1 P gene had most inter-individual variability and contained a non-sense mutation in many animals, suggesting that SCGB 1 A 1 P {{has evolved into a}} pseudogene. Analysis of SCGB 1 A 1 and SCGB 1 A 1 A sequences by endpoint-limiting dilution PCR identified a consistent difference affecting 3 [*]bp within exon 2, which served as a gene-specific “signature”. Assessment of gene- and organ-specific expression by semiquantitative RT-PCR of 33 tissues showed strong expression of SCGB 1 A 1 and SCGB 1 A 1 A in lung, uterus, Fallopian <b>tube</b> and mammary <b>gland,</b> which correlated with detection of SCGB 1 A 1 protein by immunohistochemistry. Significantly altered expression of the ratio of SCGB 1 A 1 A to SCGB 1 A 1 was detected in RAO-affected animals compared to controls, suggesting different roles for SCGB 1 A 1 and SCGB 1 A 1 A in this inflammatory condition. Conclusions This is the first report of three SCGB 1 A 1 genes in a mammal. The two expressed genes code for proteins predicted to differ in function. Alterations in the gene expression ratio in RAO suggest cell and tissue specific regulation and functions. These findings may be important for understanding of lung and reproductive conditions. </p...|$|R

A cepa 9 T de P. serpens (CT???IOC- 174) foi cultivada a 27 oC em meio Schneiders ??insect medium suplementado com 10 % de soro fetal bovino. O DNA gen??mico foi extra??do por lise alcalina para a constru????o da biblioteca gen??mica. O DNA foi parcialmente digerido com a enzima de restri????o Sau 3 A. Os fragmentos de DNA com tamanhos entre 1 - 3 kb foram recuperados do gel de agarose e purificados. Os fragmentos de DNA foram clonados no s??tio BamHI do vetor de clonagem pUC 18. A rea????o de sequenciamento foi realizada na plataforma de sequenciamento ABI 3730 ??? 48 capilar PDTIS/FIOCRUZ e na plataforma MegaBase na UERJ.

Since the refuted attempt of Donovan to create the genus Phytomonas, a great number of species were classified in the genus Phytomonas, including Phytomonas serpens, the major organism of our study. The described life cycle of P. serpens involves plant (tomato) and insect.

The goal of this project is to explore the P. serpens genome by generating and analyzing sequences of its genome aiming to increase the knowledge of this organism and to analyze comparatively with genomes of other organisms. P. serpens infects tomatoes but we still have doubts about its pathogenicity. A strain of P. serpens 9 T (CT-IOC- 174) was cultured at 27 oC in Schneiders ??insect medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The DNA was extracted by alkaline lyses for the construction of a genomic library. Genomic DNA was partially digested with the restriction enzyme Sau 3 A. DNA fragments with an average size of 1. 0 - 3. 0 kb were recovered and purified from agarose gel. DNA inserts were cloned into the BamHI restriction site of pUC 18 cloning vector. The sequencing reaction was made at the Sequencing Platform ABI 3730 - PDTIS/FIOCRUZ and MegaBase platform at UERJ. All the sequences were stored in an open source database in the Linux server in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Trypanosomatids and Phlebotomines (DBBM/IOC/FIOCRUZ). 829 clones of the P. serpens genomic DNA library were sequenced obtaining a total of 379 high quality sequences GSS (Genome Sequence Survey). Sequences from the EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) project of P. serpens available at GenBank were used for the complementation of this study. 221 GSS clusters and 697 EST clusters were compared with different databases with the similarity search program Blast, using evalue 10 - 5 as default, obtaining 599 clusters with positive hits and 303 clusters without hit, indicating possible species-specific genes. 357 clusters that were identified when compared with Gene Ontology (GO) had their function classified, representing the first analysis of P. serpens genome using GO. Phylogenetics and similarity studies with Taxonomy database from NCBI were carried out confirming the position of P. serpens in relations to the others trypanosomatids and disclosing similarity with T. cruzi genome. The phylogenetic study included sequences of the enviromental genome, in order to verify if these sequences belong to the Kinetoplastid, what was not proven to be true. Phylogenetic studies using concatenated genes showed that P. serpens is phylogenetically closer to T. cruzi, but studies with individuals genes pointed to L. major. Based on literature, we infer that the analysis of the tree of concatenated genes is correct. 20 hypothetical genes in the GSS sequences were found with the GLIMMER. We found 22 clusters in GSS sequences that were not found in EST before, among others, Pyroglutamil-peptidase I, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Peptidase_M 8...|$|R
