5|$|As the Stranger {{continues}} {{to explore the}} island, books linking to more Ages are discovered hidden behind complex mechanisms and puzzles. The Stranger must visit each Age, find the red and blue pages hidden there, and return to Myst Island. These pages can then {{be placed in the}} corresponding books. As the Stranger adds more pages to these books, the brothers can be <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> <b>heard</b> more clearly. After collecting four pages, the brothers can talk clearly enough to tell the Stranger where the fifth and final missing page for their book is hidden; if the Stranger can complete either book, that brother will be set free. The clearer dialog also allows the player to more accurately judge each brother's personality. The Stranger is left with a choice to help Sirrus, Achenar, or neither.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{originally}} considered reviving CBS's long-lost {{quiz show}} The $64,000 Question {{for a new}} era, with a new home on ABC. However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British Millionaire {{was about to make}} its debut, he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight FedEx packages from different family members, each containing a copy of Millionaires first episode. Davies was so captivated by everything that he had <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> <b>heard,</b> from host Chris Tarrant's intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the $64,000 Question revival in favor of introducing Millionaire to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.|$|E

25|$|On 25 September 2012, ex-rector of the Azerbaijan International University (which was {{stripped}} off its license and closed down in 2010) Elshad Abdullayev, who currently resides in France, posted a video on YouTube, dated 2005, {{in which a}} hidden camera captured a conversation involving himself, Gular Ahmadova and her friend Sevinj Babayeva in {{what appears to be}} an office room. During the sixteen-and-a-half-minute long footage, the three are <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> <b>heard</b> negotiating a price that Abdullayev is expected to pay in return to being given a seat in the National Assembly of Azerbaijan as an MP. In the video, Abdullayev offers to pay 500,000 USD, while Ahmadova insists on 1,000,000. In the video, Abdullayev repeatedly tries to get Ahmadova to admit that the money will go directly to the Head of the Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan Republic Ramiz Mehdiyev, though she never openly confirms that.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{vocal music}} has {{traditionally}} been sung in a thin, non resonant voice or in falsetto and is usually solo rather than choral. All traditional Chinese music is melodic rather than harmonic. Chinese vocal music probably developed from sung poems and verses with music. Instrumental pieces played on an erhu or dizi are popular, and are often available outside of China, but the pipa and zheng music, which are more traditional, are more popular in China itself. The qin {{is perhaps the most}} revered instrument in China, even though very few people know what it is or <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> <b>heard</b> one being played. The zheng, a form of zither, is most popular in Henan, Chaozhou, Hakka and Shandong. The pipa, a kind of lute, believed to have been introduced from the Arabian Peninsula area during the 6th century and adapted to suit Chinese tastes, is most popular in Shanghai and surrounding areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels around the back of the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through a dimly lit corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> <b>heard</b> on TV monitors up the stairs to the station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{before midnight}} on 26 April, Trigger {{contacted}} {{a convoy of}} six ships off the eastern Palaus. She fired six torpedoes, from , at four ships that were closely bunched and overlapping. Four hits were <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> <b>heard,</b> with a big explosion on each ship. Suddenly, a terrific explosion blew {{up one of the}} closer ships. One of the more distant ships stood straight up on her bow and sank immediately. At six minutes after midnight, Trigger launched three torpedoes at another group of ships and heard one timed explosion. At 01:57, she launched four torpedoes at a damaged cargo ship and two at an escort. The cargo ship received two more hits. Five minutes later, the submarine fired three stern tubes at a group of three escorts, and the middle one disappeared in a cloud of smoke. During the attack, Trigger sank the 11,739ton passenger/cargo ship Miike Maru and heavily damaged the destroyer escort Kasado, the 9,467ton cargo ship Hawaii Maru, and the 8,811ton cargo ship Asosan Maru. Trigger returned to Pearl Harbor on 20 May and four days later, headed for the United States for a major overhaul. She arrived at San Francisco, California, on 31 May and, after overhaul, returned to Hawaii on 11 September.|$|E
25|$|In {{the film}} X-Men, Magneto is a {{powerful}} mutant whose abilities have become near limitless. He is the main antagonist of the film. But the existence of mutants have become public {{and the subject of}} a fierce debate over whether or not to be granted the same rights as others humans or whether they should be separated all together. The US Senate is debating a Mutant Registration Act to force all mutants to reveal themselves and be registered, a move sponsored by Senator Robert Kelly. Magneto is present the day when attempts to convince the Senate to vote against mutant registration but is shouted down by Senator Kelly. When confronted by his old friend, Charles Xavier, he tells him that he had <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> <b>heard</b> the same speeches before, when the Nazis had cried out against Jews. He then asks that Xavier does not get in his way as he tries to ensure mutant supremacy. Magneto attempts to mutate the world leaders with a high-tech machine powered by his own magnetic energy installed on the Statue of Liberty's torch. As the machine is potentially lethal, he kidnaps Rogue to use as the power source instead. Unknown to Magneto, the machine would cause humans to be killed by losing their molecular structure (as seen in Senator Kelly). Even when warned of the dangers of the machine by Jean Grey and Storm, Magneto does not believe them nor does he care. In the end, while Wolverine attacks Magneto atop the torch Cyclops uses an optic blast to knock down Magneto and destroy the machine. Magneto ends locked up in a plastic prison.|$|E
