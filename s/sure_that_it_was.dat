This was important because it guaranteed France a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, a prestigious position that despite pressure from emerging nations it still holds today.|$|E

Early on the day, Atlantis commander Ferguson and pilot Hurley re-loaded software and successfully restarted the GPC-4.

25|$|Several motions {{were made}} by Joey Smallwood (a member of the {{convention}} who later served as the first premier of Newfoundland) to examine joining Canada by sending a delegation to Ottawa. The first motion was defeated, although the Convention later decided to send delegations to both London and Ottawa to explore alternatives. In January 1948, the National Convention voted against putting Confederation onto the referendum 29 to 16; but, this vote was over-ruled by the British, which controlled the National Convention and the subsequent referendum. Those who supported Confederation were extremely disappointed with {{the recommendations of the}} National Convention and organized a petition which more than 50,000 Newfoundlanders signed demanding that Confederation with Canada be placed before the people in the upcoming referendum. As most historians agree, the British government keenly wanted Confederation on the ballot and they made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E

25|$|While Rosenberg was attacking on the left, General der Kavallerie Bellegarde, {{commander}} of the Austrian 1st Korps, also set his men in motion in time, just as his orders stated. He had begun his manoeuvre just after 03:00, moving south, out of his position along the Russbach line and at Deutsch-Wagram, Bellegarde formed a vanguard of three battalions and three squadrons, {{under the command of}} General-Major Stutterheim, which he sent towards Aderklaa. A strategic village that was surrounded by an earthwork, Aderklaa offered a strong defensive position and Bellegarde was naturally expecting to encounter stiff resistance from the enemy defending the village. He was much surprised to receive reports that the village was completely undefended and, after making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a trap, Bellegarde immediately ordered his vanguard to occupy it. The 1st Korps commander then brought an additional force of 12 battalions of Feldmarshalleutnant Fresnel's division, which he deployed in two lines, behind the position and formed the rest of his Corps in a line between Aderklaa and Deutsch-Wagram. Liechtenstein's cavalry duly came up in support, taking a wide position behind 1st Korps, between Deutsch-Wagram and Süssenbrunn, but Bellegarde chose not move beyond Aderklaa. An immediate Austrian attack would have posed a serious threat to the stability of the French left wing, but Bellegarde had orders which stated that he needed to wait for the Grenadier Reserve to arrive and align itself on his right.|$|E
500|$|The Christian {{element of}} the album was most obvious in the hymn-like [...] "Word on a Wing", though for some {{commentators}} religion, like love, was simply another way for the Duke to [...] "test his numbness". Bowie himself has claimed that in this song, at least, [...] "the passion is genuine". When performing it live in 1999, the singer described it as coming from [...] "the darkest days of my life... I'm <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a call for help". The closing ballad, [...] "Wild Is the Wind", was the album's sole cover, and has been praised {{as one of the}} finest vocal performances of Bowie's career. Bowie was inspired to record it after he met singer/pianist/songwriter Nina Simone (whose version is on the eponymous 1966 album).|$|E

Around that time, Barnes left the project to complete a degree at the University of East Anglia, and returned in July 1996. In November 1995, Barrie Parker began writing levels, and developed content for the script language. Bullfrog {{tried to get a}} version out for Christmas 1995: it was originally scheduled for release in November 1995, and Molyneux, until September, believed that it would be ready by Christmas. He explained that it was mostly complete, but wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "absolutely brilliant".

According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs".

I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic.

I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines.

The critical consensus reads, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] is an enjoyable season finale that manages {{to deliver a}} few last minute scares as it ties up loose ends." [...] James Queally from The Star-Ledger commented about the season and its finale, [...] "After a wildly uneven first nine episodes... and two red-hot episodes {{leading up to the}} finale... "Afterbirth" [...] starts out flying high at the way too fast pace that has made American Horror Story an enjoyable ride these past two weeks. But somewhere in the final 30 minutes of this episode, [...] "Afterbirth" [...] turns into a wandering epilogue." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club stated, [...] "Part of the fun of those early episodes – even when I really didn't like them – was that you never quite had a good sense of what the hell kind of show you were watching. The finale sticks us into {{what seems to be a}} pretty basic setup for season two." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Afterbirth" [...] "an exhilarating shocker."
