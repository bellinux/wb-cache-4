Despite many references to burial around Mauna Kea in Hawaiian oral history, few sites have been confirmed. The lack of shrines or other artifacts on the many cinder cones dotting the volcano may be because they were reserved for burial.|$|E

40|$|The Wurmian Glaciation of the Alpine Foreland {{has been}} reconstructed in {{different}} phases {{as a result}} of investigations in the Rhine-Bodan region {{as well as in the}} Linth area. The whole High Glacial is divided in four main phases: ice advance into the piedmont basins, building-up of the foreland glaciation, high stages and retreat into the inner Alps. This epoch took up perhaps less than 12, 000 years. During the period of building, an average increase of ice thickness of about 12 cm per year was sufficient to form an extensive foreland glacier within 5000 - 7000 years. The <b>snow</b> <b>lines</b> of the stades of the piedmont glaciation as well as of the local glaciers are calculated. <b>Snow</b> <b>lines</b> at about 1500 m a. s. l. led to an inner alpine ice build-up and an advance of glaciers towards the piedmont basins. To produce the foreland ice sheet, low <b>snow</b> <b>lines</b> of 900 - 1000 m a. s. l. were necessary. An interstadial phase before the maximum glaciation is evidenced by sediment sequences and a 14 C-date of 22, 100 BP. The chronology of ice retreat after 18 ka BP is still uncertain...|$|R

25|$|Rila is a {{dome-shaped}} horst mountain, {{part of the}} Balkans' oldest land, the Macedono-Thracian Massif. It {{was formed}} by granite and gneiss rocks and crystal schists during the Cenozoic (10,000,000 years ago). Rila's alpine relief was formed during the Pleistocene {{by a series of}} glacial periods. During the most recent, so-called Würm glaciation, 10-12,000 years ago the permanent <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> was at 2,100 m above sea level. Above this line glaciers radically changed the existing relief, carving out deep cirques, sharp pyramid-shaped peaks, rock pinnacles, various valleys, moraines and other typical glacial formations.|$|E
25|$|Glacials are {{characterized}} by cooler and drier climates {{over most of the}} earth and large land and sea ice masses extending outward from the poles. Mountain glaciers in otherwise unglaciated areas extend to lower elevations due to a lower <b>snow</b> <b>line.</b> Sea levels drop due to the removal of large volumes of water above sea level in the icecaps. There is evidence that ocean circulation patterns are disrupted by glaciations. Since the earth has significant continental glaciation in the Arctic and Antarctic, we are currently in a glacial minimum of a glaciation. Such a period between glacial maxima is known as an interglacial. The glacials and interglacials also coincided with changes in Earth's orbit called Milankovitch cycles.|$|E

25|$|According to Alan Robock, who {{has also}} {{published}} nuclear winter papers, the Toba eruption did not precipitate the last glacial period. However assuming an emission of six billion tons of sulphur dioxide, his computer simulations concluded that a maximum global cooling of approximately 15°C occurred for {{three years after the}} eruption, and that this cooling would last for decades, devastating life. Because the saturated adiabatic lapse rate is 4.9°C/1,000 m for temperatures above freezing, the tree line and the <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> were around 3,000 m (9,900ft) lower at this time. The climate recovered over a few decades, and Robock found no evidence that the 1,000-year cold period seen in Greenland ice core records had resulted from the Toba eruption. In contrast, Oppenheimer believes that estimates of a drop in surface temperature by 3–5°C are probably too high, and he suggests that temperatures dropped only by 1°C. Robock has criticized Oppenheimer's analysis, arguing that it is based on simplistic T-forcing relationships.|$|E

40|$|An unsolved {{problem in}} {{step-wise}} core-accretion planet formation is that rapid radial drift in gas-rich protoplanetary disks should drive millimeter-/meter-sized particles inward {{to the central}} star before large bodies can form. One promising solution is to confine solids within small-scale structures. Here, we investigate dust structures in the (sub) millimeter continuum emission of four disks (TW Hya, HL Tau, HD 163296, and DM Tau), a sample of disks with the highest spatial resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations to date. We retrieve the surface brightness distributions using synthesized images and fitting visibilities with analytical functions. We find that the continuum emission of the four disks is ~axisymmetric but rich in 10 – 30 AU-sized radial structures, possibly due to physical gaps, surface density enhancements, or localized dust opacity variations within the disks. These results suggest that small-scale axisymmetric dust structures {{are likely to be}} common, as a result of ubiquitous processes in disk evolution and planet formation. Compared with recent spatially resolved observations of CO <b>snow</b> <b>lines</b> in these same disks, all four systems show enhanced continuum emission from regions just beyond the CO condensation fronts, potentially suggesting a causal relationship between dust growth/trapping and <b>snow</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R

500|$|The African bush {{elephant}} can {{be found}} in habitats as diverse as dry savannahs, deserts, marshes, and lake shores, and in elevations from sea level to mountain areas above the <b>snow</b> <b>line.</b> Forest elephants mainly live in equatorial forests but will enter gallery forests and ecotones between forests and savannahs. Asian elephants prefer areas with a mix of grasses, low woody plants, and trees, primarily inhabiting dry thorn-scrub forests in southern India and Sri Lanka and evergreen forests in Malaya.

500|$|Giant planet core {{formation}} {{is thought to}} proceed roughly {{along the lines of}} the terrestrial planet formation. It starts with planetesimals that undergo runaway growth, followed by the slower oligarchic stage. Hypotheses do not predict a merger stage, due to the low probability of collisions between planetary embryos in the outer part of planetary systems. An additional difference is the composition of the planetesimals, which in the case of giant planets form beyond the so-called <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> and consist mainly of ice—the ice to rock ratio is about 4 to 1. This enhances the mass of planetesimals fourfold. However, the minimum mass nebula capable of terrestrial planet formation can only form [...] cores at the distance of Jupiter (5AU) within 10million years. The latter number represents the average lifetime of gaseous disks around Sun-like stars. The proposed solutions include enhanced mass of the disk—a tenfold increase would suffice; protoplanet migration, which allows the embryo to accrete more planetesimals; and finally accretion enhancement due to gas drag in the gaseous envelopes of the embryos. Some combination of the above-mentioned ideas may explain the formation of the cores of gas giant planets such as Jupiter and perhaps even Saturn. The formation of planets like Uranus and Neptune is more problematic, since no theory has been capable of providing for the in situ formation of their cores at the distance of 20–30AU from the central star. One hypothesis is that they initially accreted in the Jupiter-Saturn region, then were scattered and migrated to their present location. Another possible solution is the growth of the cores of the giant planets via pebble accretion. In pebble accretion objects between a cm and a meter in diameter falling toward a massive body are slowed enough by gas drag for them to spiral toward it and be accreted. Growth via pebble accretion may be as much as 1000 times faster than by the accretion of planesimals.|$|E
