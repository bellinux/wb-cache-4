5|$|The Siege of Sidney Street of January 1911, {{also known}} as the Battle of Stepney, was a gunfight in the East End of London between a {{combined}} police and army force and two Latvian revolutionaries. The siege was the culmination of a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> began in December 1910, with an attempted jewellery robbery at Houndsditch in the City of London by a gang of Latvian immigrants which resulted in the murder of three policemen, the wounding of two others, and the death of George Gardstein, the leader of the Latvian gang.|$|E

In this episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} a murder for which the suspect presents an incredible alibi—that the death was foretold by an old man able to see into the future.

5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E
5|$|Crisis on Infinite Earths, {{a limited}} miniseries {{published}} in 1985, {{was written in}} order to reduce the complex history of DC Comics to a single continuity. Although Batgirl is a featured character, her role is relatively small—she delivers Supergirl's eulogy in issue seven of the 12-part series. The conclusion of Crisis on Infinite Earths changed DC Universe continuity in many ways. Following the reboot, Barbara Gordon is born to Roger and Thelma Gordon, and she is Jim Gordon's niece and adopted daughter in current canon. Post-Crisis, Supergirl does not arrive on Earth until after Gordon has established herself as Oracle, and many of the adventures she shared with Batgirl are retroactively described as having been experienced by Power Girl. In Secret Origins #20 (1987), Barbara Gordon's origin is rebooted by author Barbara Randal. Within the storyline, Gordon recounts the <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> lead to her career as Batgirl, including her first encounter with Batman as a child, studying martial arts under the tutelage of a sensei, memorizing maps and blue prints of the city, excelling in academics in order to skip grades, and pushing herself to become a star athlete.|$|E

5|$|Eorzea's history {{revolves}} around {{a series of}} Umbral and Astral Eras. Umbral Eras are periods of great calamity—the First Umbral Era {{marked the end of}} the age of gods. The guardian deities of Eorzea, known as the Twelve, retreated from direct involvement with mortals during this time. Umbral Eras are followed by periods of enlightenment and cultural growth called Astral Eras. The Third Astral Era was particularly noted for presiding over the Allagan Empire, an ancient civilization whose technology far exceeds the level of the modern age. Each Umbral and Astral Era pair corresponds to one of the six basic elements—wind, lightning, fire, earth, ice, and water. The Sixth Umbral Era was believed to be the last and the civilized races hoped the Sixth Astral Era would last forever. However, five years {{prior to the start of}} the game, the Garlean Empire catalyzed a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> would lead to the Seventh Umbral Era.|$|E
5|$|The <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> caused Kean {{to change}} the {{direction}} of DeChow's attack toward Komam-ni began at 01:00, September 3. The 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, protruded farther westward at this time than any other unit of the UN forces in Korea. Behind its positions on Sibidang-san the main supply route and rear areas were in North Korean hands, and only in daylight and under escort could vehicles travel the road. On Sibidang-san the battalion had held its original positions after the heavy fighting of September 1, completely surrounded by barbed wire, booby traps, and flares, with all supporting weapons inside its tight perimeters. The battalion {{had the advantage of}} calling for protective artillery fire covering all approaches. An hour after midnight a North Korean assault struck the battalion. The fight there continued until dawn September 3, when the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, counted 143 North Korean dead in front of its positions, and on that basis estimated that the total North Korean casualties must have been about 500 men. The 35th units also had the advantage of well-constructed strong points throughout the battle which the North Koreans could not penetrate.|$|E
5|$|However, Nansouty's move {{compromised}} Lannes's entire plan, which {{counted on}} powerful reinforcements arriving through Heinrichsdorf. An alarmed Lannes immediately sent {{one of his}} aides de camp to Grouchy urging him to stop the enemy from cutting his communications with the Emperor, whatever the cost. Grouchy duly took command of Nansouty's leading squadrons, ordering {{them back to their}} initial position, then launched a desperate but successful charge with his own dragoons, arriving in the streets of the village and cutting off its Russian defenders. Grouchy's dragoons became disorganised and were badly positioned following this sudden charge, and the Russian cavalry countercharged them, but Nansouty arrived just in time and the French repulsed the Russian cavalry, momentarily securing the position. A lively argument ensued between the two cavalry commanders. Grouchy invoked his seniority and position as commander of the cavalry and criticised Nansouty's earlier decision to withdraw. Nansouty countered by saying that he had superior experience at handling cavalry. When combat resumed, the quarrel did not prevent Nansouty from performing brilliantly under Grouchy's command during the dramatic <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> followed. Having been repulsed earlier, the Russians decided to force the position at Heinrichsdorf, and they assembled a strong infantry force preceded by no less than 60 cavalry squadrons, plus around 2,000 Cossacks. To counter this move, Grouchy opted for deception, luring some of the enemy cavalry away from the infantry. Then, Grouchy charged the enemy horse from the front; simultaneously Nansouty hit them from the flank and together Grouchy and Nansouty repulsed them. Despite numerous charges and countercharges, the French cavalry maintained the upper hand.|$|E
