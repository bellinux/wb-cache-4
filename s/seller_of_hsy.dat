40|$|Abstract Background Papaya {{is a major}} {{fruit crop}} in {{tropical}} and subtropical regions worldwide. It is trioecious with three sex forms: male, female, and hermaphrodite. Sex determination is controlled {{by a pair of}} nascent sex chromosomes with two slightly different Y chromosomes, Y for male and Y h for hermaphrodite. The sex chromosome genotypes are XY (male), XY h (hermaphrodite), and XX (female). The papaya hermaphrodite-specific Y h chromosome region (HSY) is pericentromeric and heterochromatic. Physical mapping <b>of</b> <b>HSY</b> and its X counterpart is essential for sequencing these regions and uncovering the early events of sex chromosome evolution and to identify the sex determination genes for crop improvement. Results A reiterate chromosome walking strategy was applied to construct the two physical maps with three bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries. The HSY physical map consists of 68 overlapped BACs on the minimum tiling path, and covers all four HSY-specific Knobs. One gap remained in the region of Knob 1, the only knob structure shared between HSY and X, {{due to the lack of}} HSY-specific sequences. This gap was filled on the physical map <b>of</b> the <b>HSY</b> corresponding region in the X chromosome. The X physical map consists of 44 BACs on the minimum tiling path with one gap remaining in the middle, due to the nature of highly repetitive sequences. This gap was filled on the HSY physical map. The borders <b>of</b> the non-recombining <b>HSY</b> were defined genetically by fine mapping using 1460 [*]F 2 individuals. The genetically defined HSY spanned approximately 8. 5 [*]Mb, whereas its X counterpart extended about 5. 4 [*]Mb including a 900 Kb region containing the Knob 1 shared by the HSY and X. The 8. 5 [*]Mb HSY corresponds to 4. 5 [*]Mb of its X counterpart, showing 4 [*]Mb (89 %) DNA sequence expansion. Conclusion The 89 % increase of DNA sequence in HSY indicates rapid expansion of the Y h chromosome after genetic recombination was suppressed 2 – 3 million years ago. The genetically defined borders coincide with the common BACs on the minimum tiling paths <b>of</b> <b>HSY</b> and X. The minimum tiling paths <b>of</b> <b>HSY</b> and its X counterpart are being used for sequencing these X and Y h -specific regions. </p...|$|R
