They often take over and renovate old babbler nests, in which the female lays and incubates two or rarely three eggs.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} build a four-line metro to the new suburbs {{to the east of}} the city center.

The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, automatic train protection and third rail power supply.
