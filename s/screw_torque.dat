40|$|Study Design. Bone mineral density {{variations}} {{throughout the}} sacrum were measured and correlated with sacral <b>screw</b> insertion <b>torque.</b> Objective. To quantify bone mineral density variations within the S 1 body and ala of young human specimens, especially along the pathways of sacral screws, {{and to examine}} the relation between sacral screw fixation and bone mineral density. Summary of Background Data. Vertebral bone quality is an essential factor in anterior or posterior screw fixation of the spine. Several {{studies have been conducted}} regarding bone mineral density variations in the cervical and thoracolumbar spine. However, such variations in bone mineral density in the sacrum have not been well documented. Methods. The bone mineral density of 13 sacral specimens from young male cadavers (mean age, 31 years) was measured using highly accurate quantitative computed tomography. Variations in bone mineral density were measured in five transverse layers and seven vertical columns within the S 1 body, and in four transverse layers and six vertical columns within the ala. The sacral <b>screw</b> insertion <b>torque</b> was measured (unicortical and bicortical), and the correlation with bone mineral density was calculated. Results. The mean bone mineral density of the S 1 body was 381. 9 ± 59 mg/cm 3, which was 31. 9 % higher than that of the sacral ala (mean, 296. 9 ± 86 mg/cm 3) (P< 0. 05). Bone mineral density of the superior sacral end-plate was higher than that of any other transverse layer. Columns near the lateral posterior and lateral anterior of the S 1 body had the highest bone mineral density. In the ala, bone mineral density values of the internal columns (pedicle) were the highest. <b>Screw</b> insertion <b>torque</b> for bicortical purchase along the S 1 pedicle correlated well with the bone mineral density of the S 1 body (r = 0. 67, P< 0. 05). Conclusion. This study quantified the volumetric bone mineral density variations within the S 1 body and ala, and a significant linear correlation between the <b>screw</b> insertion <b>torque</b> and bone mineral density was found. Optimal sacral screw insertion pathways were also outlined based on bone mineral density values. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Plastic Film and Sheeting and the definitive published version is available at [URL] SAGE Publications. The process dynamics of single-screw extrusion on mixtures of polypropylene (PP) and recycled PP were studied using a statistical, design of experiments (DoE) approach. For a conventional screw design, the barrel temperature, screw speed and two vastly different melt viscosity polypropylene mixtures were selected as the independent factors, whilst melt pressure, mass output, <b>screw</b> <b>torque</b> and temperature rise at the die due to shear heating were the dependent responses. A central composite design (CCD) {{in the framework of}} response surface methodology (RSM) was constructed, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out to determine the significance of the response surface models. The resulting statistical and response surface predictions have demonstrated that the low viscosity component concentration in the blend is a dominating factor on melt pressure and <b>screw</b> <b>torque,</b> apart from the expected effect of screw speed on output. Viscous heating is affected only by screw speed and recycled polypropylene concentration. Furthermore, the predictions have identified a wider process operating window with increased low-viscosity component concentration.

30|$|Locking {{plates are}} {{fundamentally}} different from conventional plates [2, 3, 5]. The biomechanical properties of locking plates are, more appropriately, likened to external fixators than traditional plates and screws [5, 17]. Locking plates rely on fixed angle screws to provide stability rather than the friction between the plate and bone generated by <b>screw</b> <b>torque</b> [17]. This intrinsic dissimilarity makes conventional plates and locking plates suited for use in different clinical scenarios [3, 18]. Conventional plates are ideal for achieving union through primary bone healing, with precise reduction, interfragmentary compression and rigid fixation [5, 17, 18]. Locking plates {{on the other hand}} are better suited for providing elastic fixation that result in secondary fracture healing with callus formation [3, 5, 17, 18].|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the potential of}} the osteoconductive material β-tricalcium phosphate to promote bone healing when coated on a titanium alloy screw implanted in the mandibular tooth socket of a healthy rat. Forty-eight 9 -week-old male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: the Blast group, which received blast-treated screws; the βTCP group, which received β-tricalcium phosphate-coated screws; and the Control group, which received mechanically polished screws. Mandibles were removed at 3 or 9 weeks after screw implantation. <b>Screw</b> removal <b>torques</b> were measured using a handheld torque gauge and compared. At both 3 and 9 weeks after implantation, the <b>screw</b> removal <b>torques</b> were significantly greater in the βTCP group than in the Blast and Control groups (p< 0. 05). Removal torques did not differ significantly between the Blast and Control groups at either time point. These results suggest that a β-tricalcium phosphate coating on screws accelerates osseous healing around the screw and increases the retentive capacity of the screw. A β-tricalcium phosphate-coated implant fitted into the tooth socket immediately after extraction may therefore provide a favorable environment for early loading of implants...|$|R

40|$|The <b>screw</b> {{fastening}} <b>torque</b> applied during {{bone fracture}} fixation has a decisive influence on subsequent bone healing. Insufficient screw tightness {{can result in}} device/construct instability; conversely, excessive torques risk damaging the bone causing premature fixation failure. This effect is even more prominent in osteoporotic bone, a condition associated annually with almost 9 million fractures worldwide. During fracture fixation, <b>screw</b> tightening <b>torque</b> is applied using subjective feel. This approach may not be optimal for patient"s recovery, increasing risk of fixation failure, particularly in osteoporotic bone, and potentially require revision surgical interventions. Besides bone density, various factors influence the performance of screw fixation. These factors include bone geometry, cortical thickness and time-dependant relaxation behaviour of the bone. If the influence of <b>screw</b> fastening <b>torque</b> on the bone and relationships between these factors was better understood, the surgical technique could be optimised {{to reduce the risk}} of complications. Within this study, we developed an axisymmetric finite element (FE) model of bone screw tightening incorporating viscoelastic behaviour of the cortical bone such as creep and stress relaxation. The model anticipated time-dependent behaviour of the bone for different bone thickness and density after a typical bone fixation screw had been inserted. The idealised model has been developed based on CT scans of bones with varying densities and inserted screws. The model was validated through a series of experiments involving bovine tibiae (4 - 5 months) to evaluate the evolution of surface strains with time (Ncorr v 1. 2). Stress distribution was assessed in photoelastic experiments using acrylic analogues. Relaxation tests have been performed in aqueous environment for up to 48 hours to ensure the relaxation would be complete. The creep behaviour (maximum principal strain) was compared against computational predictions. Our early simulations predicted relaxation strains on the surface of the bone to be 1. 1 % within 24 hours comparing favourably to 1. 3 % measured experimentally. Stress distribution patterns were in agreement with photoelastic results. Using experimentally derived viscoelastic properties, the model has the potential to predict creep and stress relaxation patterns after screw insertion with different fastening torques for bones with varying density and geometry. We aim to develop this into a planning tool providing guidance to surgeons for optimal tightening when using screw fixation, particularly in reduced quality bone...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Previous {{studies that}} {{evaluated}} the torque needed for removing dental implant screws have not considered {{the manner of}} transfer of the occlusal loads in clinical settings. Instead, the torque used for removal was applied directly to the screw, {{and most of them}} omitted the possibility that the hexagon could limit the action of the occlusal load in the loosening of the screws. The present study proposes a method for evaluating the <b>screw</b> removal <b>torque</b> in an anti-rotational device independent way, creating an unscrewing load transfer to the entire assembly, not only to the screw. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty hexagonal abutments without the hexagon in their bases were fixed with a screw to 20 dental implants.

Materials and Methods: The study sample was divided into three groups (n = 10) as follows: group EH – external hexagon implant, group IH – internal hexagon implant, and group MT – Morse taper implant. Universal abutments were screwed on the implants, and metal crowns were cemented onto the abutment.

40|$|Abstract. A {{vertical}} {{livestock feed}} mixer with spring-controlled packaging unit was designed, constructed and tested. This design had in focus a weighing and gauging mechanism which made possible a semi-automatic packaging {{in conjunction with}} feed mixing and discharge operations. The main components of the machine included a double-wall cylindrical mixing chamber consisting of recycling gate, discharge gate, evacuating gate, window and a screw conveyor inside an inner cylinder. The packaging mechanism {{is attached to the}} discharge gate and the base of the frame with the frame serving as the structural support for the machine and its contents. The main design parameters included screw conveyor features such as helix angle, fill ratio, normal pressure due to bulk load on screw shaft, axial force per pitch, total <b>screw</b> <b>torque,</b> capacity and power requirements of the screw conveyor. The design concept of the packaging mechanism involved determination of free length of spring, total active length, pitch of spring, spring index, stiffness of spring, maximum shear stress and total spring rate. In a hitch-free operation, the machine was designed to package 25 kg of mixed feed ingredients at a time. In operation, the feed ingredients are scooped and moved upward by the rotary movement of the screw conveyor and then sprayed back into the smaller cylinder without passing through the internal tube. A preliminary testing was carried out on the machine to determine the actual discharge rate and hence the performance of the packaging mechanism. Results revealed that an average discharge rate of 0. 356 kg/s was obtained.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{marginal}} fit of crowns on the Straumann (ITI) ® Dental Implant System with special consideration of different casting dental materials. Material and methods: Sixty porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns were fabricated: 18 crowns on standard cone abutments with an impression cylinder, partially prefabricated analogs, no coping and screw-retained (A); 18 crowns on solid abutments without an impression device, no analogs, no coping and cemented (B); and 18 crowns on solid abutments using an impression transfer cap, an analog with a shoulder, no coping and cemented (C). In each group, six crowns were made on epoxy mastercasts (Bluestar®), six on synthetic plaster (Moldasynt ®) and six on super hard stone (Fujirock®). Six additional crowns were fabricated with the transversal screw retention system onto the Octa® system with impression transfer caps, metal analogs, gold copings and screw-retained (D). Impregum® was used as impression material. Crowns of B and C were cemented with KetacCem ®. Crowns of A and D were fixed with an occlusal <b>screw</b> <b>torqued</b> at 15 N cm. Crowns were embedded, cut and polished. Under a light microscope using a magnification of × 100, the distance between the crown margin (CM) and the shoulder (marginal gap, MG) and the distance between the CM and the end of the shoulder (crown length, CL) was measured. Results: MGs were 15. 4 ± 13. 2 μm (A), 21. 2 ± 23. 1 μm (B), 11 ± 12. 1 μm (C) and 10. 4 ± 9. 3 μm (D).

40|$|The {{abutment}} {{connection with}} the crown is fundamental to the structural stability of the implant system and to the prevention of mechanical exertion that can compromise {{the success of the}} implant treatment. The aim {{of this study is to}} clarify the difference in the stress distribution patterns between implants with internal and external-hex connections with the crown using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Material and Methods: The internal and external-hex connections of the Neoss and 3 i implant systems respectively, are considered. The geometrical properties of the implant systems are modeled using three-dimensional (3 D) brick elements. Loading conditions include a masticatory force of 200, 500 and 1000 N applied to the occlusal surface of the crown along with an abutment <b>screw</b> <b>torque</b> of 110, 320 and 550 Nmm. The von Mises stress distributions in the crown are examined for all loading conditions. Assumptions made in the modeling include: 1. half of the implant system is modeled and symmetrical boundary conditions applied; 2. temperature sensitive elements are used to replicate the torque within the abutment screw. Results: The connection type strongly influences the resulting stress characteristics within the crown. The magnitude of stress produced by the internal-hex implant system is generally lower than that of the external-hex system. The internal-hex system held an advantage by including the use of an abutment between the abutment screw and the crown. Conclusions: The geometrical design of the external-hex system tends to induce stress concentrations in the crown at a distance of 2. 89 mm from the apex. At this location the torque applied to the abutment screw also affects the stresses, so that the compressive stresses on the right hand side of the crown are increased. The internal-hex system has reduced stress concentrations in the crown. However, because the torque is transferred through the abutment screw to the abutment contact, changing the torque has greater effect on this hex system than the masticatory force. Overall the masticatory force is more influential on the stress within the crown for the external-hex system and the torque is more influential on the internal-hex system.

40|$|Introduction: The {{aim of this}} {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} was to compare torque recordings at insertion time and 1 week post-placement between immediately loaded orthodontic miniscrews and an unloaded control group. Trial design: This RCT was designed as parallel with an allocation ratio of 1 : 1. Methods: Eligibility criteria to enroll patients were: needs of fixed orthodontic treatment, no systemic disease, absence of using drugs altering bone metabolism. All patients were consecutively treated in a private practice and the miniscrews were placed by the same author. Patients received ORTHOImplant (3 M Unitek) miniscrews and they were blindly divided in two groups: group 1 screws were unloaded between T 0 and T 1, group 2 received immediately loaded screws with NiTi coil. For each patient, maximum insertion torque (MIT) was evaluated at T 0. After 1 week, without loading, the <b>screw</b> <b>torque</b> was measured again (T 1) {{and at the end}} of the treatment maximal removal torque was evaluated (T 2). Torque variation in the first week was considered as the primary outcome. Randomization: A randomization list was created for the group assignment, with an allocation ratio of 1 : 1. Blinding: The study was single blinded in regard of the statistical analysis. Results: Patients enrolled in the clinical trial were 51 for a total of 81 miniscrews. The recruitment started in November 2012 and the observation period ended in August 2014. Twenty-six and twenty-five patients were analysed in group 1 and 2, respectively. The MIT mean in each placement time was 18. 25 Ncm (SD = 3. 00), 11. 41 Ncm (SD = 3. 51) and 10. 52 Ncm (SD = 5. 14) at T 0, T 1, and T 2 time, respectively. In group 1, the torque decrease between T 1 and T 0 was statistically higher compared to group 2 (P value = 0. 003). Statistically significant effects of the placement times on MIT were found (P value < 0. 0001). No serious harm was observed. Limitations: This study was performed using only direct force on the miniscrew and not using the miniscrew as an indirect anchorage. It was not possible to obtain quantitative data on bone quality or root proximity to miniscrews. Conclusions: A significant stability loss was observed in the first week in both groups; Group 1 showed a statistically higher torque loss in the first week when compared to the immediately loaded group. There were statistically significant effects of the measurement times on MIT and of the miniscrew location on MIT. The overall failure rate was 7. 4 %.

40|$|This {{in vitro}} study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} mechanical cycling on the <b>torque</b> of retaining <b>screw</b> in external hexagon implants with platform switching (PS), regular platform (RP) and wide platform (WP). A total of 30 specimens were equally divided into 3 groups: PS, PR and WP. Each specimen was prepared with implants: 3. 75 x 10 mm for RP group and 5. 0 x 10 mm for PS and WP groups and its respective abutment with 32 Ncm torque. All groups were subjected to 106 cycles with 100 N (corresponding to about 40 months of chewing). The results were obtained with the reverse torque of each specimen and data were evaluated using ANOVA and Tukey test (p< 0. 05). The PS group showed statistically significant difference in <b>screw</b> removal <b>torque</b> (30. 06 &# 177; 5. 42) compared with RP (23. 75 &# 177; 2. 76) and WP (21. 32 &# 177; 3. 53) (p< 0. 05) groups; the RP and WP groups showed {{no statistically significant difference}} between them. It was concluded that the PS group showed higher reverse torque value, suggesting lower susceptibility of the abutment screw loosening...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} study {{presented in this}} paper consists of two series of tests concerned with jointing performance of wood screws for particleboard. In the first series of test, withdrawal test of wood wcrews from the face or edge of particleboard were performed. In withdrawal tests, the sizes of wood screw and pilot hole were varied and the driving torque was also measured. In the second series of tests, two specimens (rail and post) of particleboard were constructed in the form of L-type with wood screws, Knife thread insert nuts or adhesive, and the rail was placed in the flat position. The bending load (out-of-plane force) was applied to it, and static and repetitive bending tests of L-type construction were carried out. And from the measured results, the angular stiffness of the L-type construction was calculated from Eq. (82 ̆ 7). The results obtained are as follows. (1) Under a constant diameter of wood <b>screw,</b> driving <b>torque</b> and withdrawal resistance increase with increase of the length of screw. However, under a constant length of wood <b>screw,</b> driving <b>torque</b> increases with increase of the diameter of screw, but withdrawal resistance decreases. These results indicate that it is more effective to use longer wood screws than to use thicker screws. (2) Withdrawal resistance of each size of wood screw is affected by the diameterratio of pilot hole to wood screw and it shows the largest value at the diameter ratio 0. 5. Considering a labor efficency at the jointing work, however, it seems better to use the diameter ratio 0. 6 to 0. 7. (3) The bending fracture load of L-type constructinos connected with wood screws is affected considerably by the length of wood screw and is under control of the internal bond strength of particleboard. The angular stiffness of L-type construction depends on both withdrawal resistance and the resistanceto the deformation of the wood screw caused by bending load. The fracture load and the angular stiffness show larger values in the case that the L-type construction is connected with insert nuts than those in the case of wood screws. (4) The strength and the stiffness of L-type construction are improved by jointing with both wood screws and adhesive. Especially, by use of epoxy resin, the strength increases remarkably. (5) The fatigue strength of L-type construction connected with each type of joints is in proportion approximately to their static strength. パーティクルボードを供試材料として,その接合部の性能を評価するための基礎資料を得る目的から,案内孔寸法と木ねじのねじ込みトルクおよび引抜き抵抗との関係,ならびに木ねじ,ねじ込み式ナットおよび接着剤による接合部の静的あるいは繰返し曲げ荷重に対する強度および剛性について基礎実験を行ない,以下の結論を得た. (1) 長さの異なる木ねじについては,引抜き抵抗はねじ込みトルクに比例して増加するが,直径の異なる場合は,ねじ込みトルクの増加に伴う引抜き抵抗の増加が少ない. また,各寸法の木ねじに対して,その引抜き抵抗は案内乳棒比がほぼ 0. 5 のときに最大値をとる. (2) 木ねじにより接合したしL字試験片に此げ荷重を加えた場合,その破壊荷重は木ねじの長さおよび棚板の内部結合力に支配される. また,角度変化に関する剛性は,木ねじの引抜き抵抗および曲げあるいさません断=よる変形に対する抵抗に支配される. (3) ねじ込み式ナットを用いて接合した場合は,圧入式のAタイプを除いて, 強度および剛性ともに木ねじの場合より高い値を示す. (4) 木ねじと接旨剤を併用することにより,強度および剛性ともに改善することができる. とくに,エポキシ樹脂接着剤を用いた場合,強度を著しく向上することができ,その破壊形態にも頓著な差異が認められる. (5) 繰返し曲げ試験では,いずれの接合法においても,荷重と破壊繰返し数との間には,両対数グラフ上で負の直線相関が認められる. また,疲労強度は静的強度に支配される...|$|R

Fracture torque tests and hydrogen content analysis {{were performed on}} baked screws to evaluate hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility. The diffusible hydrogen content within 10 B 21 steel dominated the fracture behavior of the <b>screws.</b> The fracture <b>torque</b> of 10 B 21 screws baked for a long duration was affected by released hydrogen. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) result showed that hydrogen content decreased with increasing baking duration, and thus the HE susceptibility of 10 B 21 screws improved. Diffusible hydrogen promoted crack propagation in high-stress region. The HE of 10 B 21 screws can be prevented by long-duration baking...|$|R
40|$|Bone {{drilling}} is a {{major part}} of orthopaedic surgery performed during the internal fixation of fractured bones. At present, information related to drilling force, drilling torque, rate of drill bit penetration and drill bit rotational speed is not available to orthopaedic surgeons, clinicians and researchers as bone drilling is performed manually. This research demonstrates that bone drilling force data if recorded in-vivo, during the repair of bone fractures, can provide information about the strength/quality of the bone. Drilling force does not give a direct measure of bone strength; therefore it has been correlated with the shear strength and screw pullout strength to determine the efficacy in estimating the bone strength. Various synthetic bone material densities and animal bones have been tested to demonstrate the use of drilling force data. A novel automated experimental test rig, which enables drilling tests, screw insertion and screw pullout tests to be carried out in a controlled environment, has been developed. Both drilling and screw pullout tests have been carried out in a single setting of the specimen to reduce the experimental errors and increase repeatability of the results. A significantly high value of correlation (r² > 0. 99) between drilling force & shear strength and also between drilling force & normalised screw pullout strength in synthetic bone material was found. Furthermore, a high value of correlation (r² = 0. 958 for pig bones and r² = 0. 901 for lamb bones) between maximum drilling force & normalised screw pullout strength was also found. The result shows that drilling data can be used to predict material strength. Bone screws are extensively used during the internal fixation of fractured bones. The amount of screw been tightened {{is one of the main}} factor which affects the bone-screw fixation quality. Over tightening of screw can result into the loss of bone-screw fixation strength, whereas under tightening can result in the screw loosening. Therefore, optimum tightening of the screw is important to achieve the maximum bone-screw fixation strength. At present, optimum tightening of the screw is entirely dependent upon the skill and judgment of the surgeon, which is predominantly based on the feel of the <b>screw</b> tightening <b>torque.</b> Various studies have been reported in the literature to develop an algorithm to set an optimum tightening torque value to be used in surgery. A method which is based on the use of rotation angle of the screw while tightening, rather than using <b>screw</b> insertion/tightening <b>torque,</b> to optimise the bone-screw fixation strength is proposed in this research. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been successfully demonstrated on the synthetic bone material using the designed test rig.

40|$|Transcription in eukaryotes {{produces}} {{a number of}} long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Two of these, MALAT 1 and Menbeta, generate a tRNA-like small RNA {{in addition to the}} mature lncRNA. The stability of these tRNA-like small RNAs and bona fide tRNAs is monitored by the CCA-adding enzyme. Whereas CCA is added to stable tRNAs and tRNA-like transcripts, a second CCA repeat is added to certain unstable transcripts to initiate their degradation. Here, we characterize how these two scenarios are distinguished. Following the first CCA addition cycle, nucleotide binding to the active site triggers a clockwise <b>screw</b> motion, producing <b>torque</b> on the RNA. This ejects stable RNAs, whereas unstable RNAs are refolded while bound to the enzyme and subjected to a second CCA catalytic cycle. Intriguingly, with the CCA-adding enzyme acting as a molecular vise, the RNAs proofread themselves through differential responses to its interrogation between stable and unstable substrates...|$|R
