Fugen in Unzen between 1990 and 1995, many disaster prevention facilities have been constructed in <b>sand</b> erosion <b>control</b> districts to improve the regional safety. The <b>sand</b> erosion <b>control</b> districts however are extensive and some are located in a national park. Furthermore, {{since many of the}} <b>sand</b> erosion <b>control</b> districts are closely located to local residential areas, and the frequency of debris flows was decreasing, requests were made by the local residents and municipalities to utilize the districts for the rehabilitation and development of the Shimabara area. In response, a plan was established which addresses the needs of the local communities by using part of the <b>sand</b> erosion <b>control</b> districts for such a purpose without sacrificing their functions, and projects were carried out in stages in accordance with the plan. Since there is little precedence for the use of <b>sand</b> erosion <b>control</b> districts for purposes other than the original intent, the results of the attempt in the Shimabara area are expected to yield important insights for future application of this approach.

40|$|Composts, vermicomposts {{and their}} liquid {{extracts}} can suppress plant infections {{caused by a}} variety of pathogens, however this suppression is highly variable, which limits their use in commercial crop production. In addition to the inherent variability of these materials, conflicting information abounds in the industry and extension educational materials regarding liquid compost extracts which were critically evaluated with respect to the existing scientific literature. As a case study, non-aerated liquid vermicompost extract was produced that promoted seedling growth, consistently suppressed zoospore-mediated infections of Pythium aphanidermatum on cucumber and maintained suppressiveness for 60 days at room temperature. As both a liquid fertilizer and a cultural practice for the suppression of seedling damping off, this material could satisfy multiple needs for organic growers. After decades of study, we still lack critical insight into the mechanisms of action of suppressive composts. We sought to uncover potential mechanisms by which vermicomposted dairy manure suppresses Pythium aphanidermatum infections on cucumber by investigating the interactions between seed-associated microbial communities and P. aphanidermatum zoospores. We found that vermicompost-derived seed-colonizing microbes prevented the arrival of zoospores on the seed surface and greatly reduced infection in disease suppression bioassays. When microbially modified seed exudates were collected from the bioassay apparatus and exposed to zoospores in vitro, fewer zoospores swam towards, encysted on and germinated in response to exudates from seeds colonized by a suppressive microbial community than to those from seeds sown in sterile <b>sand.</b> Combining <b>control</b> and modified exudates failed to restore zoospore response, indicating the presence of a toxin or repellant confirmed by the consistent lysis of zoospores in the vermicompost and combined treatment, but not the <b>sand</b> <b>controls.</b> Exposing zoospores to control and modified seed exudates that had been ethyl acetate fractionated provided evidence that the putative toxin/repellant is exclusively present in the organic fraction...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of the {{recruitment}} potential, {{as well as}} post-recruitment survival, between different reef habitats, would improve the management of target species and conservation of reef ecosystems. Many coral reefs have been subjected to, and continue to suffer from, habitat degradation due to both natural and anthropogenic stress. However, the effects of habitat degradation on larval recruitment potential and on the survival of settled recruits are currently not known. We aimed to distinguish between these two processes by simultaneously measuring survival and recruitment of vertebrate and invertebrate larvae across habitats differing in their percentage of coral cover (healthy vs dead: 50 % vs 12 % coral cover) with a 100 % sand habitat as a control. Recruitment and survival were monitored after 10, 20, 40 and 80 days on atolls in French Polynesia.
