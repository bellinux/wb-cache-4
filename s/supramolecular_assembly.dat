25|$|Supermicelle is a {{hierarchical}} micelle structure (<b>supramolecular</b> <b>assembly)</b> where individual components are also micelles. Supermicelles are formed via bottom-up chemical approaches, such as self-assembly of long cylindrical micelles into radial cross-, star- or dandelion-like patterns in a specially selected solvent; solid nanoparticles may {{be added to}} the solution to act as nucleation centers and form the central core of the supermicelle. The stems of the primary cylindrical micelles are composed of various block copolymers connected by strong covalent bonds; within the supermicelle structure they are loosely held together by hydrogen bonds, electrostatic or solvophobic interactions.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{example of}} {{applying}} π-π interactions in <b>supramolecular</b> <b>assembly</b> is {{the synthesis of}} catenane. The major challenge for the synthesis of catenane is to interlock molecules in a controlled fashion. Stoddart and co-workers developed a series of systems utilizing the strong π-π interactions between electron-rich benzene derivatives and electron-poor pyridinium rings. Catanene was synthesized by reacting bis(pyridinium) (A), bisparaphenylene-34-crown-10 (B), and 1, 4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene C (Fig. 2). The π-π interaction between A and B directed {{the formation of an}} interlocked template intermediate that was further cyclized by substitution reaction with compound C to generate the catenane product.|$|E

2500|$|A micelle (...) or micella (...) (plural {{micelles}} or micellae, respectively) is {{an aggregate}} (or <b>supramolecular</b> <b>assembly)</b> of surfactant molecules dispersed in a liquid colloid. A typical micelle {{in aqueous solution}} forms an aggregate with the hydrophilic [...] "head" [...] regions in contact with surrounding solvent, sequestering the hydrophobic single-tail regions in the micelle centre. This phase {{is caused by the}} packing behavior of single-tail lipids in a bilayer. The difficulty filling all the volume of the interior of a bilayer, while accommodating the area per head group forced on the molecule by the hydration of the lipid head group, leads to the formation of the micelle. [...] This type of micelle is known as a normal-phase micelle (oil-in-water micelle). Inverse micelles have the head groups at the centre with the tails extending out (water-in-oil micelle). Micelles are approximately spherical in shape. Other phases, including shapes such as ellipsoids, cylinders, and bilayers, are also possible. The shape and size of a micelle are a function of the molecular geometry of its surfactant molecules and solution conditions such as surfactant concentration, temperature, pH, and ionic strength. The process of forming micelles is known as micellisation and forms part of the phase behaviour of many lipids according to their polymorphism.|$|E

40|$|We {{study in}} the melt the linear {{viscoelastic}} properties of <b>supramolecular</b> <b>assemblies</b> obtained by adding different amounts of nickel ions to linear entangled poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) building blocks endfunctionalized by a terpyridine group. We first show that the elasticity of these <b>supramolecular</b> <b>assemblies</b> is mainly governed by the entanglement dynamics of the building blocks, while the supramolecular interactions delay or suppress their relaxation. By adjusting the amount of metal ions, the relaxation {{time as well as}} the level of the low-frequency plateau of these <b>supramolecular</b> <b>assemblies</b> can be controlled. In particular, the addition of metal ions above the 1 : 2 metal ion/terpyridine stoichiometric ratio allows secondary supramolecular interactions to appear, which are able to link the linear <b>supramolecular</b> <b>assemblies</b> and thus, lead to the reversible gelation of the system. By comparing the rheological behavior of different linear PEO samples, bearing or not functionalized chain-ends, we show that these extra supramolecular bonds are partially due to the association between the excess of metal ions and the oxygen atoms of the PEO chains. We also investigate the possible role played by the terpyridine groups in the formation of these secondary supramolecular interactions...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} designing any large network is {{the assembly of}} systems that are resilient to change. From a chemical point of view, an analogy can be employed where one requires <b>supramolecular</b> <b>assemblies</b> to maintain their dimensionality combined with limited structural perturbation in response to variation in its intermolecular framework. The identification of hydrogen bonded framework patterns within experimentally known <b>supramolecular</b> <b>assemblies</b> that are structurally robust to disruption and selective hydrogen substitution are envisioned {{to act as a}} supramolecular blueprint or template for metal-ion retroinsertion. Herein we report the formation of a large neutral discrete pseudospherical coordination capsule assembled from 6 pyrogallol[4]arene ligands and 24 Cu(II) metal-ions. Amazingly, this coordination capsule is structurally analogous to its hydrogen bonded counterpart. This shows a robust ability of pyrogallol[4]arene molecules to self-assemble into large hexameric cage structures from either the hydrogen bonding or metal-ligand coordination process.

40|$|The {{development}} of synthetic pathways to yield advanced functional materials {{is an important}} aspect of materials science. In particular, the ability to control and manipulate the chemical composition and structure of inorganic nanomaterials is highly desirable. Two synthetic approaches which show great promise for producing the next generation of functional inorganic nanomaterials are (1) templating of <b>supramolecular</b> <b>assemblies</b> and (2) ion exchange within nanostructured inorganic solids to manipulate chemical composition. Templating of <b>supramolecular</b> <b>assemblies</b> of surfactants and amphiphilic polymers has already proven to be a powerful technique in synthesizing various inorganic structures. Namely, numerous examples of mesostructured metal oxides (SiO{sub 2 }, TiO{sub 2 }, WO{sub 3 }, etc.) have been synthesized by templating the liquid crystalline phases of amphiphilic polymers and surfactants (i. e. vesicles, 2 D and 3 D hexagonal and cubic phases, etc.) with inorganic precursors, resulting in the formation of highly ordered inorganic-organic hybrid materials. Although the templating of <b>supramolecular</b> <b>assemblies</b> has been successful in generating highly ordered mesostructured metal oxides, {{there are only a few}} examples of non-oxidic mesostructured inorganic materials. The recent developments of ion exchange within nanoparticles offer a promising approach to generating novel nanostructured inorganic materials with unique chemical compositions. Konenkamp et al. and Alivisatos et al. have successfully utilized the ion exchange methods to fully transform the chemical composition of simple nanostructured inorganic materials while retaining their shapes. Although the exact mechanism by which the ions exchange while retaining the overall structure is still unclear, this approach combined with templating of <b>supramolecular</b> <b>assemblies</b> can provide a potent technique for obtaining highly ordered inorganic materials with unique structures and chemical compositions. Herein, we describe for the first time, the successful synthesis of highly ordered, mesostructured Cu{sub x}S, by combining the templating of the <b>supramolecular</b> <b>assemblies</b> of non-ionic amphiphilic polymer method with the cation exchange method to transform mesostructured cadmium sulfide (CdS) into mesostructured copper sulfides (CuS, Cu{sub 2 }S) ...|$|R
