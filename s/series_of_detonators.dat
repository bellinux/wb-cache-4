40|$|The {{objective}} of this Thesis was to strategically redesign and transform the supply chain of a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>detonators</b> in a leading Company serving {{the oil and gas}} industry. The scope of the Thesis included data gathering and analysis, and the proposal and implementation of possible solutions. The issues addressed included sourcing and partnership strategies and development of systemic inventory management policies. We optimized the inventory policies to minimize the ordering and holding costs while improving the customer service level. For this purpose, we considered the entire supply chain starting from the Company's internal and external suppliers and Subcontractors {{all the way to the}} end-customers. By considering all these players we were able to globally optimize the supply chain. The inventory policy used was a periodic review policy for which we optimized the reorder, order-up-to level and Safety Stock levels. We analyzed the effects of the forecasting error and the potential benefits of risk pooling. (cont.) We also identified and recommended a new push-pull boundary for the Company's detonator products and provided a generic platform to identify this boundary for other products within the Company. The supply chain management system and managerial insights developed from this project can potentially be extended to other products and divisions within the Company. by Konstantinos F. Zafiriou.

It {{is defined by the}} power <b>of</b> the <b>detonator</b> which is certain to prime the explosive to a sustained and continuous detonation. Reference is made to the Sellier-Bellot scale that consists <b>of</b> a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> 10 <b>detonators,</b> from n. 1 to n. 10, each of which corresponds to an increasing charge weight. In practice, most of the explosives on the market today are sensitive to an n. 8 detonator, where the charge corresponds to 2 grams of mercury fulminate.|$|R

The USBM used mixtures of nitromethane and ethylene diamine, the sensitivity being 'fine-tuned' by 2 -nitropropane.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the results of induced stress measurement in damaged regions around a test tunnel excavated by smooth blasting. The blasting design was for a test tunnel excavation 8 m 2 in cross section, with an advance per round of 2. 5 m. Five rounds were performed by two types <b>of</b> <b>detonators,</b> each with a large-hole cut and perimeter holes in a 0. 4 m spacing. One is electronic detonators (EDs) which were used in the holes on the perimeter of the right half, the other is conventional pyrotechnical long period delay <b>detonators</b> <b>of</b> 0. 25 deci second interval (PDs) which were used in the holes on the perimeter of the left half. In order to compare the delay accuracy <b>of</b> two <b>detonators,</b> a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> stress measurement was performed from the tunnel wall. It was made clear that EDs had little influence on remaining rock and surface, and PDs generated a damaged region. The damaged region generated by PDs was within 1 m from the tunnel surface and vertical stress hardly acted on the damaged region. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{rear part}} <b>of</b> a <b>detonator</b> is usually {{made of a}} rigid but {{malleable}} aluminium alloy, sometimes supported by a relatively soft brass or copper structure to aid in reliably giving a strong and watertight seal without damaging the initiation source. A pair <b>of</b> <b>detonator</b> crimping pliers mate the detonator with the initiation source by allowing the detonator's back end to be inserted into the large hole present when the pliers is in the non-compressed position. When force is applied, the jaws will move closer to each other crimping the neck <b>of</b> the <b>detonator.</b> This shows that the function is just a simple crimping tool, adapted for one specific item.|$|R

40|$|As {{part of a}} new {{materials}} effort, we are exploring the use of sol- gel chemistry to manufacture energetic materials. Traditional manufacturing of energetic materials involves processing of granular solids. One application is the production <b>of</b> <b>detonators</b> where powders <b>of</b> energetic material and a binder are typically mixed and compacted at high pressure to make pellets. Performance properties are strongly dependent on particle size distribution, surface area of its constituents, homogeneity of the mix, and void volume. The goal is to produce detonators with fast energy release rate the are insensitive to unintended initiation. In this paper, we report results of our early work in this field of research, including the preparation <b>of</b> <b>detonators</b> from xerogel molding powders and aerogels, comparing the material properties with present state-of-the-art technology...|$|R

5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} and testing <b>of</b> the critical <b>detonators</b> was shared between Lauritsen's group at Caltech and Robert Henderson's group at Los Alamos. By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box <b>of</b> <b>detonators</b> manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|R
