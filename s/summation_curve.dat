40|$|Purpose. The area of {{complete}} spatial summation (Ricco's area) {{is the largest}} stimulus size for which area × intensity is constant at threshold. The authors sought to investigate whether Ricco's area changes in early glaucoma {{to account for the}} decreased visual signal/noise ratio that may accompany retinal ganglion cell loss. Methods. Spatial summation functions were measured, and Ricco's area was determined at four 10 ° retinal locations in 24 patients with early glaucoma (total deviation at test locations, mean, − 1. 3 dB; range, + 2 dB to − 8 dB) and 26 age-similar healthy subjects under achromatic and S-cone isolation conditions. Achromatic grating resolution acuity was measured at the same locations to estimate functional ganglion cell density. Results. Ricco's area was enlarged in patients compared with controls for both achromatic (enlarged by: superior field, 0. 57 log units, P < 0. 01; inferior field, 0. 72 log units, P < 0. 01) and chromatic (enlarged by: superior field, 0. 26 log units, P < 0. 01; inferior field, 0. 25 log units, P = 0. 065) stimuli, with negligible vertical <b>summation</b> <b>curve</b> shifts along the intensity axis. Resolution acuity was significantly reduced in glaucoma patients in both hemifields (P < 0. 001). There was a weak, but significant, relationship between Ricco's area and resolution acuity. Conclusions. Enlargement of Ricco's area completely compensates for reduced perimetric sensitivity in early glaucoma to maintain constant threshold at Ricco's area, suggesting an increase in signal pooling in response to ganglion cell loss. The rightward displacement of the spatial <b>summation</b> <b>curve</b> indicates that perimetric stimuli should be capable of modulating in size as well as/instead of contrast, which may boost the glaucoma signal within measurement noise...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} (217 / 325, 66 %) of the neurons in {{the middle}} temporal (MT) area/V 5 show strong antagonistic surrounds, defined here by a decrease of at least 50 % in the <b>summation</b> <b>curve.</b> We mapped the antagonistic surround in 145 such cells, using eight circularly distributed surround stimulus patches (Surround Asymmetry Test, SAT) and also mapped the surround in 51 of these 145 cells using a grid consisting of 25 square patches (Surround Mapping Test, SMT). Both tests showed that the angular surround distribution was non-uniform {{in the majority of}} these neurons. In half the neurons, the antagonistic surround was asymmetric, and arose from a single region {{on one side of the}} excitatory receptive field (ERF). In another quarter of the sample the surround was bilaterally symmetric, and arose from a pair of regions on opposite sides of the ERF. Only the remaining 20 % showed a circularly symmetric surround distribution. These three groups differed in their laminar distribution. The SMT showed that, radially, the surround antagonism reached a maximum, on average, at 1. 5 times the ERF radius, Detailed comparisons of the spatial relationships of excitatory and inhibitory regions of the RF components shows that non-homogeneity of the surround influence appears to be an intrinsic property of the surround. Such a property may underly the extraction of the surface orientation and curvature from speed patterns...|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{organization}} of receptive {{fields in the}} middle temporal (MT) area of anaesthetized and paralysed macaque monkeys was studied. In all, 288 neurons were successfully recorded. The {{size and shape of}} the receptive field (RF) was mapped with small patches of translating random dots and the resulting data were fitted with a generalized Gaussian. Results show that the RF area increases with eccentricity, and is larger in lamina 5 than in other layers. Most of these RFs are elongated, and the axis of elongation tends to be orthogonal to the preferred direction of motion. The direction selectivity is maintained in all positions in the RF, but layer 5 cells are less direction-selective than cells in other layers. In a second series of experiments, radial dimensions of the classical RF and the antagonistic surround were estimated from area summation tests. These data were fitted with the difference of the integrals of two Gaussians. Surrounds were weakest in layer 4 and strongest in layer 2. Optimal stimulus diameters, also estimated from the area <b>summation</b> <b>curve,</b> were larger in the infragranular layers than in the other layers. The maximum sensitivity of the surround was clearly displaced from the classical RF (CRF) centre, indicating that the surround is not concentric with the CRF. This radial offset and the extent of the surround were largest in layers 2 and 5 and smallest in 3 a. The extent of the surround half-height equalled, on average, 3 - 4 times that of the CRF. These results suggest that antagonistic surrounds are constructed in MT, probably through horizontal connections, and that a strong vertical organization exists in area MT, as has been shown for V 1. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{heat stress}} index (HSI) is a new, {{comprehensive}} summer index that evaluates daily relative stress for locations throughout the United States based on {{deviations from the}} norm. The index is based on apparent temperature and other derived meteorological variables, including cloud cover, cooling degree-days, and con-secutive days of extreme heat. Statistical distributions of meteorological variables are derived for 10 -day periods of the annual cycle so that percentile values for each parameter can be determined. The daily percentile values for each variable are then summed, and a statistical distribution is fit to the summed frequencies. The daily HSI value is the percentile associated with {{the location of the}} daily summed value under the <b>summation</b> <b>curve.</b> The index is analyzed and spatially verified by comparing intra- and interregional results. Although stations from various climate regions have different criteria defining an excessive heat stress event, neighboring stations typically produce similar HSI results because they are usually affected by the same air mass. To test the effectiveness of the HSI, a relationship between the index results and mortality values is made. Overall, the highest mortality days are associated with the highest HSI values, but high-HSI days are not always associated with high numbers of deaths. A mortality study such as this one {{is just one of many}} potential environmental applications of the HSI. Other applications include implementing the index to correlate extreme weather con-ditions with resource consumption, such as electric-utility load, to determine conditions for which load levels are excessive. The ability to forecast the HSI using a variety of weather forecasting tools has also generated interest within various industries that have a need to issue weather stress advisories, watches, and warnings. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{reversing}} the polarity of luminance contrast in adjacent segments {{of a bar}} stimulus have been investigated in complex cells of area 17 in cats lightly anaesthetized with nitrous oxide/oxygen halothane mixtures. On the basis of length summation behaviour, complex cells were classified as standard (length summating) or special (optimum response to a bar much shorter than the receptive field), after Gilbert (1977), and were further subdivided into groups lacking and possessing end-stopping. For each type of complex cell, we measured the effects of adding short segments of one polarity of contrast (light or dark) to either end of a bar of fixed length and optimum orientation but of opposite contrast. In all cells {{the response to the}} central bar was depressed by short segments of reversed contrast to an extent greater than predicted from the cells' length summation characteristics. Responses were minimized or abolished at a critical segment length. Increases beyond the critical length elicited a progressive recovery in response to a plateau level. In end-stopped cells this was followed by a further decline in response up to the limits of the cells' inhibitory end-zones. Special and standard complex cells differed only in their susceptibility to reversed-contrast segments above the critical length. In standard complex cells, the recovery of response matched the cells' length summation profiles in slope and cut-off point. In special complex cells the recovery was flatter in slope and significantly more protracted than the length summation profile. Similar results were obtained for either direction of motion (orthogonal to a cell's optimum orientation) and for either polarity of contrast (dark centre, light ends or the reverse). As might be expected, all the effects were weighted in favour of the receptive field centre. Thus the upturn in response as reversed-contrast segments were progressively extended was more rapid and achieved a higher limiting level when the central bar was short. Merely interrupting the contours of a bar by a central gap, rather than a segment of reversed contrast, gave rise to no more attenuation of response than that predictable from the length <b>summation</b> <b>curve.</b> The results are compared and contrasted with our comparable data for simple cells...|$|E

30|$|We also {{conducted}} a diffraction stack migration of reflection waves in S codas to estimate boundaries with high-impedance contrast, {{such as the}} background medium and fractures. For the water flow model, the existence of fractures (paths for water migration) is an important factor. A constant velocity model {{was used in the}} calculation. The semblance value of a certain hyperbolic trajectory in seismic traces is applied as a weighting factor of the conventional migration to enhance the imaging results (Hollman et al. 1999). When the values along the hyperbolic trajectory differ from each other, it will return a small value. The factor can enhance only the stacking values from the real reflectors while reducing the artifacts. Considering that the errors appear as distortion of the <b>summation</b> <b>curves</b> with inaccurate positions in the simplified velocity model, it is predicted that their effect is related to the pulse duration of the extracted signal. Our simulation results show that for a 0.1 - to 0.2 -s pulse duration, a position error of less than 300  m will not affect the imaging result significantly [details are given in Yi et al. (2017)].|$|R
40|$|One of {{the more}} {{stunning}} examples of the resoucefulness of human vision {{is the ability to}} see 'biological motion', which was first shown(1) with an adaptation of earlier cinematic work(2) : illumination of only the joints of a walking person is enough to convey a vivid, compelling impression of human animation, although the percept collapses to a jumble of meaningless lights when the walker stands still. The information is sufficient to discriminate the sex and other details of the walker(3, 4), and can be interpreted by young infants(5). Here we measure the ability of the visual system to integrate this type of motion information over space and time, and compare this capacity with that for viewing simple translational motion. Sensitivity to biological motion increases rapidly with the number of illuminated joints, far more rapidly than for simple motion. Furthermore, this information is summed over extended temporal intervals of up to 3 seconds (eight times longer than for simple motion). The steepness of the <b>summation</b> <b>curves</b> indicates that the mechanisms that analyse biological motion do not integrate linearly over space and time with constant efficiency, as may occur for other forms of complex motion(6), but instead adapt {{to the nature of the}} stimulus...|$|R
40|$|Contrast {{sensitivity}} improves {{with the}} area of a sine-wave grating, but why? Here we assess this phenomenon against contemporary models involving spatial summation, probability summation, uncertainty, and stochastic noise. Using a two-interval forced-choice procedure we measured contrast sensitivity for circular patches of sine-wave gratings with various diameters that were blocked or interleaved across trials to produce low and high extrinsic uncertainty, respectively. <b>Summation</b> <b>curves</b> were steep initially, becoming shallower thereafter. For the smaller stimuli, sensitivity was slightly worse for the interleaved design than for the blocked design. Neither area nor blocking affected {{the slope of the}} psychometric function. We derived model predictions for noisy mechanisms and extrinsic uncertainty that was either low or high. The contrast transducer was either linear (c 1. 0) or nonlinear (c 2. 0), and pooling was either linear or a MAX operation. There was either no intrinsic uncertainty, or it was fixed or proportional to stimulus size. Of these 10 canonical models, only the nonlinear transducer with linear pooling (the noisy energy model) described the main forms of the data for both experimental designs. We also show how a cross-correlator can be modified to fit our results and provide a contemporary presentation of the relation between summation and the slope of the psychometric function...|$|R

This surrounding field is conventionally referred to as “nonclassical receptive field” (nCRF). In recent years, some investigators reported that the extent of CRF and/or nCRF of V 1 neurons is not fixed but may vary with stimulus contrast. We have reexamined the spatial summation property for 101 V 1 neurons at a high (20 – 80 %) and a low (3 – 15 %) contrast. By fitting the spatial <b>summation</b> <b>curves</b> of the neurons obtained at different contrast using the difference of Gausians (DOG) model, {{we were able to}} estimate quantitatively the contrast-induced variation of the extent of CRF and nCRF for this group of cells. Our results showed that both the excitatory CRF and suppressive nCRF expanded at low stimulus contrast, but the expansion was more marked for the CRF than that for the nCRF. Moreover, the strength of surround suppression decreased or even disappeared under the low contrast condition. Our data suggest that at higher stimulus contrast both the shrinkage of excitatory CRF and the increase of surround suppression may improve spatial resolution for the perceived images...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{summation}} {{processes of}} single neurones of cat 2 ̆ 7 s pretectal region were investigated with moving and stationary visual stimuli.

By contrast, in some direction sensitive neurones different characteristics of responses for the two opposite directions of movement were observed.

The same was observed for the 2 ̆ 2 ON 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 OFF 2 ̆ 2 responses in the ON-OFF neurones.

Contrast detection thresholds (in 28 observers) were measured for a spot of light of 10 different sizes [area: 0. 03 – 1. 92 (°) 2] at different retinal meridians (0 °, 45 °, 90 °, 135 °, 180 °, 225 °, 270 °, and 315 °) and eccentricities (0 °, 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, and 20 °). Contrast detection thresholds were significantly affected {{by the size of}} the stimulus with sensitivity improving with stimulus size consistent with Ricco's law. <b>Summation</b> <b>curves</b> were similar across different spatial meridians, but the extent of spatial summation increased with retinal eccentricity consistent with previous reports. The size of the stimulus was also shown to affect contrast detection thresholds in the periphery. In particular, contrast detection thresholds decreased more rapidly with increasing eccentricity for a smaller target than a larger one. This difference in performance is accounted for by the accompanying change in Ac with eccentricity. In Experiment 2, we show that spatial uncertainty affected contrast detection, particularly at eccentric locations greater than 5 °, such that cueing the location of the stimulus improved contrast thresholds. Spatial uncertainty improved overall performance but did not affect the estimates of the critical areas of summation. The results of the present study indicate that, due to spatial summation, detection performance is highly dependent on the size of the stimulus, its eccentric location, and spatial uncertainty. Future perimetric methodologies must consider these factors to improve detection sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of seismic imaging, based on Feynman path {{integrals}} for waveform modelling, is capable of producing accurate subsurface images without any need for a reference velocity model. Instead of the usual optimization for traveltime curves with maximal signal semblance, a weighted summation over all representative curves avoids the need for velocity analysis, with its common difficulties of subjective and timeconsuming manual picking. The <b>summation</b> over all <b>curves</b> includes the stationary one that plays a preferential role in classical imaging schemes, but also multiple stationary curves when they exist. Moreover, the weighted <b>summation</b> over all <b>curves</b> also accounts for non-uniqueness and uncertainty in the stacking/migration velocities.

In all these cases, a properly defined weighting function plays a vital role: to emphasize contributions from traveltime curves close to the optimal one and to suppress contributions from unrealistic curves. The path-integral method is an authentic macromodel-independent technique in the sense that there is strictly no parameter optimization or estimation involved.

40|$|Purpose Recent studies {{propose that}} the use of target stimuli within or close to {{complete}} spatial summation reveal larger threshold elevation in ocular disease. The Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer (HFA) is used to assess visual function yet the spatial summation characteristics are unexplored for the central macular region. We therefore wanted to establish the relationship between contrast sensitivity and stimulus size (spatial summation) within the central 20 ° visual field using the high sampling density of the 10 - 2 test grid. Methods Thresholds were measured for one eye from 37 normal subjects using the HFA 10 - 2 test grid with all five Goldmann (G) targets (GI to GV). Subject data were converted to 50 -year-old equivalent using published and calculated location-specific decade correction factors. Spatial <b>summation</b> <b>curves</b> were fitted for all data at all locations. The size of Ricco’s critical area (Ac) within which complete spatial summation operates (k = 1), and the slope of partial summation (k < 1 : to characterize partial summation), was established. Results The 50 -year-old age normative data were determined for all Goldmann stimulus sizes for the 10 - 2 HFA test grid and showed a marked change in contrast sensitivity for small test stimuli (e. g. GI) and little change in larger test stimuli (e. g. GV). Both the Ac and k values did not vary with age allowing for the application of the age correction factors. Ac and k values increased with eccentricity with GI remaining within complete spatial summation and GII was close or within complete spatial summation. GIII or larger test sizes were always outside complete spatial summation operating within various levels of partial summation. Conclusions The developed normative data now allows comparisons of data sets with high sampling density using the 10 - 2 grid irrespective of subject age. Test size is important when assessing ocular disease yet only GI or GII stimuli operate close to or within complete spatial summation in the macula. Current visual field testing protocols employ GIII which is always outside complete spatial summation and operates under various values of partial summation: GIII {{may not be the most}} suitable test size to assess ocular disease affecting the macula...|$|R

40|$|The {{transport}} of mobile sodium ions to the Si-SiO 2 interface in a metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor causes gross distortions of the capacitance-volt-age characteristics. While these changes might {{be interpreted as}} increased surface-state densities, this paper shows experimentally that the surface-state densities are unchanged by mobile ion concentrations n the 1012 /cm 2 range. By comparison of high- and low-frequency capacitance vs. voltage measurements and conductance vs. voltage measurements, it is shown that the distortion of C-V curves {{can be explained by}} fluctuations imposed on the surface potential by a nonuniform pileup of sodium ions at the Si-SiO 2 interface. This argument is further supported by a theoretical reproduction of the experimental C-V curves obtained by a statistical <b>summation</b> of ideal <b>curves.</b> Although the theoretical nature of the voltage de-pendence of capacitance in metal-oxide-sil icon (MOS) structures is well-understood, experimental measure-ments generally show significant deviations from the ideal curves. In addition to flatband voltage shifts caused by fixed charge in the oxide and metal contact potentials, deviations from the ideal capacitance struc-ture in the depletion domain have been ascribed to surface states, Nss, at the Si-SiO 2 interface (1). We have observed a change of structure in the capacitance-voltage (C-V) structure when sodium impurities, in-troduced during device fabrication, are driven to the Si-SiO 2 interface. Related measurements, however, indicate no change in the surface-state density with changes in location of ionized impurities in the oxide. These changes in the capacitance structure are reversi-ble and appear to be caused by potential variations due to a nonuniform distribution of sodium at the Si-SiO 2 interface. This physical hypothesis was studied by comparing quasi-static and high frequency surface-state measure-ments with conductance measurements. These com-parisons have allowed us to distinguish between dis-tortion caused by charge inhomogeneities introduced by sodium ions near the interface and distortions caused by carrier trapping sites (fast surface states) which might have been introduced by drifted sodium...|$|R
40|$|Future {{increase}} in the market demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) will pose new challenges to the existing infrastructure for LNG distribution. The Universal Buoyancy System (UBS) seeks {{to contribute to the}} solution of these challenges by offering a new, cost-efficient, and safe solution for small scale LNG transfer, as an alternative to land based distribution. A critical component in the UBS is the floating cryogenic pipeline, connecting an onshore LNG terminal to an inshore loading buoy. The loading buoy acting as an interface between the UBS system and the LNG-carrier, being a floating structure secured to the ship-hull with permitted motions in heave, pitch, and roll. To determine the operational performance of the bonded flexible pipeline when incorporated into the UBS, a global dynamic finite element model has been established. The model seeks to accurately display the response characteristics of a bonded flexible pipeline subjected to critical environmental conditions, with special considerations on curvature and displacements for varying levels of pre-tension and hang-off angles. The configuration chosen is that of a taut flexible pipeline, floating at the surface and attached to the loading buoy with a hang-off angle. The configuration allows for translation of the pipe's shore-end in the longitudinal direction, while applying a fixed boundary condition at the interface between the pipe and buoy. Buoy motions in six degrees of freedom (DOF) have been introduced to ensure accurate modelling of the pipe and buoy interaction. This, as response amplitude operators (RAO) for coupled buoy response where not available {{at the time of the}} analyses. Three different pre-tension levels have been applied for two different hang-off angles to evaluate the pipeline's response, seeking to determine combination of maximum hang-off angle and minimum pre-tension that will keep the curvature within the design criteria. Thus, not compromising the integrity of the pipe and ensuring safe transfer operations. Furthermore, model tests of the independent and coupled response for the UBS loading buoy has been performed to validate numerical RAOs, investigate the functionality of the connection system, and obtain data for verification of a multi-body dynamic analysis developed by F&# 230;hn. The experimental RAOs have been found to correspond well with numerical estimates, generally displaying values of lower response. Thus, extreme responses from the global pipeline analysis are believed to be conservative with regards to the design limits. Additionally, the connection system was observed to perform above expectations, but should be re-designed to allow for transverse displacements on one of the connection arms to reduce stresses from pinching. Nonetheless, maximum forces in the transverse and normal directions of the connection system were found to comply with the present-day design criteria; reaching extreme values of 43 [kN] and 35 [kN], respectively. The model test was deemed a success, providing important information for the continuing design process. Results from the global analysis indicate that the implementation of a bonded flexible pipe into the Universal Buoyancy System is highly feasible. It was discovered that a pre-tension of 15 [kN] or more needs to be applied for the pipe to comply the design criteria at a maximum hang-off angle of 30 [deg]. This was found to be the largest angle that could safely be applied without increasing the bending stiffness towards the termination point. For the 15 [kN] pre-tension, a maximum curvature of 0. 34 [1 /m] was observed, corresponding to a minimum bend radius (MBR) of 2. 94 [m] at the tie-in between the loading buoy and the pipeline. In relation to the curvature design limit of 0. 37 [1 /m], this was found to be acceptable and indicates that the structural integrity of the pipe will not be compromised throughout the service life. It should be noted that the design limits were not exceeded for tension in any case applied. To establish the accumulated fatigue damage throughout the service life of the pipeline, a local stress analysis has been performed. A simplified approach based on application of formulations from structural mechanics is presented, where it is assumed that the internal steel helices will be the critical cross-sectional component with regards to fatigue accumulation. Through use of Miner <b>summation</b> and S-N <b>curves,</b> the consummation of fatigue resistance was found to correspond to 4. 1 % of the allowable limit over the expected service life of the system. This is acceptable and in accordance with API standards. It is recommended that the bending stiffness should be increased towards the termination point between the loading buoy and pipeline to allow for a larger hang-off angle. This will reduce the pipeline-buoy interaction, and should be accomplished by modifying the integrated bending stiffener or by restricting the curvature with other means. A follow-up study will therefore be required to obtain the new optimal combination of pre-tension and hang-off angle, as these are dependent on each other. It is further recommended that a pre-tension level of 20 [kN] is applied for the analysed configuration, this as the benefits with regards to curvature and stresses are found to exceed the disadvantages of an additional 5 [kN] {{increase in}} pre-tension. </p...|$|R
