5|$|The plane's {{landing gear}} {{mired in the}} water and mud, causing the plane to flip upside down and <b>skid</b> <b>to</b> a stop. Although the {{aircraft}} survived the landing nearly intact, Petty Officer Koga died instantly on impact, probably from a broken neck or a blunt-force blow to his head. Koga's wingmen, circling above, had orders to destroy any Zeros that crash-landed in enemy territory, but as they did not know if Koga was still alive, they could not bring themselves to strafe his plane. They decided to leave without firing on it. The Japanese submarine stationed off Akutan Island to pick up pilots searched for Koga in vain before being driven off by the destroyer USS Williamson.|$|E

25|$|The Aggies {{finished}} the 2003 {{season with a}} 4–8 record, including a nationally televised 77–0 loss to Oklahoma, the worst loss in A's history. The season also marked the first losing season for the Aggies after 21 years. In the 2004 season, Franchione attempted the rebuilding process as the team improved to a 7–5 record, and a 5–3 record in conference play, including a 35–34 overtime loss to unranked Baylor, ending a 13-game winning streak the Aggies had over Baylor and a 32–25 overtime win over the then #25 Texas Tech at Kyle Field, snapping a 3-game <b>skid</b> <b>to</b> the Red Raiders. The Aggies ended up advancing to the Cotton Bowl Classic to play #17 Tennessee, but lost 38–7. Following the bowl game, A officials extended Franchione's contract through 2012 and raised his salary to $2 million. In June 2005, prior to the 2005 season, Franchione donated $1 million to the A athletic department. The donation went toward {{the construction of an}} indoor practice facility, which is now located adjacent to Kyle Field.|$|E
25|$|After an {{interlude}} by Mr. Hudson, furious {{about the}} need to re-shoot the first scene, the scene continues from where it left off. The rally car speeds up continuing the donuts that ended the first scene before speeding to the far left corner of the arena where a police car suddenly appears. The rally car brakes with just centimetres to spare. It then reverses half the width of the arena before performing a reverse-180 turn and driving towards the second police car at the far right of the arena. The rally car then speeds up to the left end of the arena with the second police car following it. At this point the rally car drifts the corner before returning to the right side performing a 180 <b>skid</b> <b>to</b> park the car perpendicular with the right wall. The two police cars follow performing the same manoeuvre resulting in the three cars being in parallel with each other. The rally car first races off the arena through the centre exit. The police cars then meet in the middle and perform donuts, with the nose of each car nearly touching the next, before following the exit of the rally car. At this point the motorcyclist makes his return by shooting a third police car with his gun, which causes it to split in half.|$|E
2500|$|In later examples, {{such as that}} in the Shuttleworth Collection, the {{horizontal}} tail surface was shorter, the leading edges being swept at about 45°. [...] A distinctive feature of the type was that {{the trailing edge of}} the rudder and elevator was braced by wires leading to the control horns. [...] The controls consisted of a wheel mounted on an inverted U-shaped yoke, the uprights of which were outside the fuselage structure. Fore and aft movement of the entire yoke operated the elevator and the wheel operated the wing warping. [...] The rudder was controlled by pedals. [...] The undercarriage consisted of a pair of trapezoidal frames, each braced by a diagonal member extended forwards to form a short upcurved <b>skid</b> <b>to</b> protect the propeller in the case of nose-overs, with a pair of wheels carried on a sprung cross axle between the two frames.|$|E

2500|$|The Type D was {{the third}} and last of Handley Page's early single-seat monoplanes (the Type B being a biplane). [...] It was a close {{relative}} of the Type A, which crashed on its first turn, and the [...] Type C which did not fly at all. [...] Like them the Type D used the wing patented by José Weiss that promised, but failed to deliver, automatic lateral stability. [...] Its structure {{was based on a}} rigid inner section, built with four spars and standard ribs with a flexible outer section carried on ribs attached fanwise {{from the end of the}} spars in a bird-like fashion. The wing was braced by wires from a tall, narrow inverted V kingpost, lifting loads being carried by symmetrical bracing to a matching V post under the fuselage. [...] This latter structure also carried the two-wheel single axle undercarriage and a long central <b>skid</b> <b>to</b> prevent nosing over and to hold the tail clear of the ground. After the Type A crash, Handley Page had added wing warping for lateral control to the Type C. [...] The Type D also used this system, with a steering wheel pulling on wires to the mid-wing via the kingpost. [...] The horizontal tail was an approximately 60° delta with rounded tips; most of the surface moved to form the single-piece elevator and carried the rudder post and split (above and below the elevator) rudder, so that all the control surfaces moved together as a cruciform piece. The elevator was operated by pushing or pulling the lever-mounted steering wheel and the rudder by a [...] "foot tiller". There was no fixed fin.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the episode}} [...] "Nocturne", Entity FX {{ran into a}} snag {{when it came time}} to create the image of the episode's villain {{grabbing}} hold of a LuthorCorp helicopter. Mat Beck did not want to [...] "cheat" [...] the audience by using a cut technique to show Byron holding the helicopter; instead, Entity FX used CGI to create an entire helicopter. From there they decided they wanted the helicopter blades to cut-up the hedges. The special effects team tried to track Sean Faris' hands, as he was holding onto a crossbar that represented the helicopter's <b>skid,</b> <b>to</b> find a spot where they could make the helicopter roll toward the hedge. Unfortunately, Faris did not move in a manner that they could use, so the effects team created a pair of CGI hands on the skid, and performed the action they needed with the computer model. In [...] "Dichotic", guest star Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays Ian Randall, a high school student who can duplicate himself. To create the effect of Ian splitting himself, Entity FX used three difference techniques. First, the primary shot of a CGI face pushing its way through a digital image of Thomas' back in three dimension; second, the team used [...] "shadowplay", which is a two dimensional shot appearing on a wall as though the audience is seeing Ian's shadow as he splits himself; last, the team applied another two dimensional effect to the final moment of separation, when strands of CGI flesh snap back to each body. Entity FX worked on the scene in [...] "Fever" [...] where the audience follows kryptonite particles down into Martha's lungs. Mat Beck and his team wanted to be as realistic as possible when digitally crafting the anatomy of the lungs, but they also decided to take certain liberties with the structures in order to [...] "make [...] look cool". The camera follows the green kryptonite particles down Martha's throat, until they attack the alveoli, which subsequently begin turning green.|$|E

60|$|Ever {{since the}} vessel left the docks, {{there had been}} six sets of spars of a form so singular, lying among the booms, that they had often {{been the subject of}} {{conversation}} between the mates and myself, neither of the former being able to tell their uses. These sticks were of no great length, some fifteen feet at the most, of sound English oak. Two or three pairs were alike, for they were in pairs, each pair having one of the sides of a shape resembling different parts of the ship's bottom, with the exception that they were chiefly concave, while the bottom of a vessel is mainly convex. At one extremity each pair was firmly connected by a short, massive, iron link, of about two feet in length; and, at its opposite end, a large eye-bolt was driven into each stick, where it was securely forelocked. When the Walrus was stationary, we learned, for the first time, the uses of these unusual preparations. A pair of the timbers, which were of great solidity and strength, were dropped over the stern, and, sinking beneath the keel, their upper extremities were separated by means of lanyards turned into the eye-bolts. The lanyards were then brought forward to the bilge of the vessel, where, by the help of tackles, the timbers were rowsed up in such a manner that the links came close to the false keel, and the timbers themselves were laid snug against each side of the ship. As great care had been taken, by means of marks on the vessel, as well as in forming the skids themselves, the fit was perfect. No less than five pairs were secured in and near the bilge, and as many more were distributed forwards and aft, according to the shape of the bottom. Fore-and-aft pieces, that reached from one <b>skid</b> <b>to</b> the other, were then placed between those about the bilge of the ship, each of them having a certain number of short ribs, extending upwards and downwards. These fore-and-aft pieces were laid along the waterline, their ends entering the skids by means of mortices and tenons, where they were snugly bolted. The result of the entire arrangement was, to give the vessel an exterior protection against the field-ice, by means of a sort of network of timber, the whole of which had been so accurately fitted in the dock, as to bear equally on her frame. These preparations were not fairly completed before ten o'clock on the following morning, when Noah stood directly for an opening in the ice before us, which just about that time began to be apparent.|$|E
