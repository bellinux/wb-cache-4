Nakon toga govori se o sporazumima između suugovaratelja koji se ne smatraju obnovom. U nastavku se obrađuje razgraničenje obnove od sličnih instituta, a zatim pravni učinci valjanog ugovora o obnovi. U završnom poglavlju su sumirani rezultati analize izvršene u radu. According to the Obligations act (Official gazette, Nr. 35 / 05 and 41 / 08), renewal (novation, lat. novatio) is {{a contract}} between the creditor and debtor {{in which the}} existing obligation is terminated and {{is replaced by a}} new one, while the new contract has a different main obligation or different legal basis. Change of a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>obligation</b> is not considered a novation. For the novation it is necessary to cumulatively fulfil the following assumptions: 1. existence of a valid (old) main obligation, 2. will of the parties to exchange the existing obligation for a new one 3. difference between the main obligation or the legal basis, 4. will of the contractor (animus novandi). If the previous obligation was voidable, a legally valid novation is possible, but only if the debtor knew for the reasons of voidance. It is than taken that the debtor, by agreeing to novation, has given up the right to void the contract from which the obligation arises that is being renewed. If the debtor did not know about the voidance of the previous obligation, he is authorised to demand the termination of the contract about novation; after the contract on novation was terminated, it is considered that there was no novation and that the previous obligation did not stop. Novation has certain similarities with settlements and exchange of fulfilment, but still differs from these institutes. With novation, {{there has to be an}} intention and expressed will of the contract parties that by creating the new obligation the old one seizes to exist, while with settlement the previous legal relation is modified so that the first claim or obligation remain in some limited form. When talking about the realtion of novation and exchange of fulfilment, the difference is the following: whit novation the existing obligation is exchanged with a new one so that the old obligation seizes to exist without fulfilment, while with exchange of fulfilment the first obligation does not seize immediately – it seizes after he completes his new obligation. The basic legal impact of the legally valid contract on novation is shown in the fact that the previous obligation seizes to exist, and a new one starts instead. Means of insurance connected to the old obligation seize to exist as well (e. g. deposit, guarantee), as well as all the other subsidiary means – unless otherwise agreed upon in the contract. Nach dem Obligationengesetz (Amtsblatt Narodne novine Nr. 35 / 05 und 41 / 08) ist die Novation (novatio) ein Vertrag zwischen einem Gläubiger und einem Schuldner, durch den die bestehende Schuld erlischt und durch eine neue ersetzt wird, wobei sich der neue Vertrag auf eine andere Hauptleistung oder einen anderen Rechtsgrund bezieht. Die Veränderung einer Nebenleistung gilt nicht als Novation. Für die Novation müssen kumulativ folgende Voraussetzungen erfüllt sein: 1. das Bestehen einer gültigen (alten) Hauptschuld, 2. der Wille der Parteien, die bestehende Schuld durch eine neue zu ersetzen, 3. die Unterschiedlichkeit der Hauptleistung oder des Rechtsgrundes sowie 4. der Wille der Vertragsparteien (animus novandi). War die frühere Schuld anfechtbar, so ist eine rechtsgültige Novation möglich, allerdings nur, wenn der Schuldner den Grund der Anfechtbarkeit kannte. Dann wird davon ausgegangen, dass ein Schuldner, der der Novation zustimmt, auf sein Recht, den Vertrag, aus dem die erneuerte Schuld hervorgeht, anzufechten, verzichtet hat. Wusste der Schuldner nicht von der Anfechtbarkeit der früheren Schuld, ist er berechtigt, die Aufhebung des Novationsvertrags zu verlangen. Ist der Novationsvertrag aufgehoben, gilt, dass es keine Novation gab und die frühere Schuld nicht erloschen ist. Die Novation hat gewisse Ähnlichkeiten mit dem Vergleich und dem Erfüllungsersatz, unterscheidet sich aber von diesen Instituten. Bei der Novation muss die Absicht und der bekundete Wille der Vertragsparteien bestehen, dass mit Entstehung einer neuen Schuld die alte erlischt, während beim Vergleich das frühere Rechtsverhältnis modifiziert wird, sodass der ursprüngliche Anspruch beziehungsweise die Schuld in einer geminderten Form weiter bestehen. Zwischen der Novation und dem Erfüllungsersatz wiederum besteht der Unterschied, dass bei der Novation die bisherige Schuld durch eine neue ersetzt wird, sodass die alte Schuld ohne Erfüllung endet, während beim Erfüllungsersatz die ursprüngliche Schuld des Schuldners nicht sofort erlischt, sondern erst, wenn er seine neue Schuld geleistet hat. Die grundlegende Rechtswirkung eines rechtsgültigen Novationsvertrags äußert sich darin, dass die frühere Schuld erlischt und statt ihrer eine neue entsteht. Auch Sicherheiten (z. B. Pfand, Bürgschaft), die an die frühere Schuld geknüpft waren, sowie sonstige Nebenansprüche erlöschen, sofern nichts anderes vereinbart wurde...|$|E
40|$|Very preliminarynot {{for general}} {{distribution}} An inuential {{theory in the}} management literature (Christensen, 1997) argues that incumbent rms have di ¢ culty commercializing innovations that are not initially useful to its existing customers, and recommends creating separate, autonomous units for the innovation. This paper explains why subsidiary entities, even when wholly-owned and formally controlled by their corporate parent, can assist in this process. I show that placing the innovation in a subsidiary creates more autonomy for the unit manager of the innovation than if the same project were held as a division inside the parent entity. The key di¤erence between subsidiaries and divisions in my model is limited liabil-ity: unlike a division, the parent has the option {{to walk away from}} the <b>subsidiarys</b> <b>obligations.</b> Because of this implicit put option, the parent invests less in develop-ing internal uses for the innovation. This causes the unit manager to invest more in developing independent uses for the innovation, for two reasons. First, less investment by the parent means the unit manager must sink or swimon the product of his own e¤ort. Second, less parent involvement means that the unit managers desired actions are less subject to overrule. This increases the unit managers initiative, as in Aghion and Tirole (1987). ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the modern}} world, company groups {{have become a}} {{commercial}} reality. With increasing regulatory and compliance requirements for different industries, larger companies are often more optimally managed in a group structure. The individual companies within a group structure still operate in the economic interest of {{the group as a}} whole. Despite this reality, company law has strictly upheld the separate legal personality of individual companies within a group. As a result of this separate legal personality, the holding company of the group cannot be held liable for its <b>subsidiaries</b> <b>obligations.</b> This creates room for abuse, especially since the holding company is able to control which obligations may be incurred by the subsidiaries in the first instance. This paper will discuss some of the abuses and possible unintended consequences of extending separate legal personality and limited liability to companies operating within a group. The author will seek to evaluate the common law remedy for piercing the corporate veil as a possible remedy against these abuses. The statutory remedy for piercing the corporate veil under section 20 (9) of the Companies Act will similarly be evaluated. The research will conclude that these remedies do not consider the unique policy and economic realities of company groups and therefore are not adequate to address the abuse which may occur in company groups...|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} {{concerned}} with the political thought of Richard Price, the Eighteenth Century Dissenter and publicist on moral, theological, political and financial matters. In particular, it is an attempt to show how his political philosophy is influenced by his discussion of ethical questions and by his pre-occupation with the problems of freedom of worship. He applies his basic principle, that each individual has both a duty and a right to act and to govern himself in accordance with the deliverances of his own conscience in various ways; it is made to serve the Dissenters in their quest for religious freedom, it forms the basis of the radical transformation of whig political theory, and it is brought to the defence of the American colonists in their struggle for self-government. An examination of these different applications of this principle draws attention to Price's interpretation of the claims of conscience, to his contribution to the Eighteenth Century debate to the nature of moral judgment, and to his justification of democracy. In criticism it is suggested that he distorts the nature of moral and political obligation by misconstruing the 'privacy' of individual conscience, and by interpreting the function of reason in ethics in terms of an incorrigible and non-discursive intuition. An attempt is then made to re-interpret Price's defence of liberal and democratic institutions on the assumption that we have <b>subsidiary</b> <b>obligations</b> to criticise our consciences and to secure the adjustment of conflicting moral conceptions. Burke's attack upon him {{as a representative of the}} radical philosophers is also discussed, and, in the light of recent criticism, an attempt is made to assess to what extent his defence of democratic institutions has illiberal tendencies. <p...|$|R
40|$|The idea of 'subsidiarity' {{has been}} gaining {{influence}} within the European Community. 'Subsidiarity' {{is based on a}} view of society in which responsibilities are conditioned by the closeness of people's relationships. Intervention at higher levels of society has to be seen as <b>subsidiary</b> to the <b>obligations</b> of smaller social units. Applied more narrowly {{in the context of the}} Community, subsidiarity has been taken to refer to a functional division of administrative responsibilities, although at times the principle is referred back to its wider usage; it implies an emphasis on decentralisation and diversity. The gradual expansion of European interventions in national social policies has depended on a strategy of developing precedents and competence. The idea of subsidiarity, used virtually as a synonym for national sovereignty, has been enlisted to oppose this trend. Although the principle does limit the scope of a supra-national organisation, there is still scope for a European social policy which establishes principles and develops other kinds of solidarity. If, moreover, the issue is genuinely one of subsidiarity, it implies not only that the European Commission must limit and devolve its powers, but that wherever possible national governments should do the same...|$|R
