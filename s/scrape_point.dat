25|$|The 2013/14 season {{started in}} {{disastrous}} style, with a 5–1 home defeat against Leyton Orient in which striker Lee Miller was sent off for violent conduct. A 4–0 drubbing away at Bradford followed, before another 4–0 defeat {{at the hands}} of Coventry at home, before <b>scraping</b> <b>points</b> against Colchester and Brentford. Another heavy defeat in the League Cup followed as Championship side Leicester City secured a 5–2 victory at Brunton Park, before a narrow 1–0 home defeat to Port Vale spelled the end of Abbott's 5-year reign as United manager, just 2 points from 6 games had been the final straw for the club's Board.|$|R
25|$|New Zealand were {{defeated}} only {{twice in the}} tournament, both times by Pakistan, in their final group match and in the semi-final. Pakistan had been lucky {{to be in the}} semi-finals at all: following only one victory in their first five matches, they were also fortunate to <b>scrape</b> a <b>point</b> from the washed-out match against England which appeared to be heading for a heavy English victory, after Pakistan had been bowled out for 74: eventually they finished one point ahead of Australia with a superior run-rate.|$|R
25|$|N.C. State quarterback Daniel Evans {{threw for}} 347yards and 3 touchdowns while wide {{receiver}} Donal Bowens {{was on the}} receiving end of 202 of those yards. Despite a poor performance from the Virginia defense, the Virginia offense still <b>scraped</b> together 24 <b>points</b> on a streaky night by quarterback Jameel Sewell.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was evident}} that they must now either <b>scrape</b> around the <b>point</b> on that tack or go ashore, and Frank felt his nerves tingle as he gazed into the spray. He fancied that there was {{something}} black and solid beyond it, but could distinguish nothing further. Then the blackness faded, the sea seemed to become a little more regular, and Harry cried out hoarsely, [...] "We're round!" ...|$|R
25|$|Warwickshire's long batting line-up came to {{surprisingly}} little {{use in the}} Twenty20 Cup, as they lost their first two matches, and their first win came against hapless Glamorgan. After six games, they had only <b>scraped</b> five <b>points,</b> and endured two one-run losses to Worcestershire. They managed {{to get through to}} the quarter-finals, however, thanks to big wins over Somerset and Northamptonshire. They followed that up with two wins in the National League, over Derbyshire and Durham, and also made it to the C Trophy semi-final with a five-wicket victory of Kent. So, going into the Twenty20 game with Surrey, they were on a five-game win streak, and after the scores were tied under the Duckworth-Lewis method the teams had to face off in a bowl-off. Warwickshire lost 3-4 to bow out of the tournament.|$|R
50|$|The {{impact of}} {{upgrades}} to Hamilton's {{car for the}} next race at the Nürburgring for the German Grand Prix were positive and saw him qualify in 5th, with Kovalainen in 6th place. However, a collision with Mark Webber's Red Bull at the first corner punctured a tyre and damaged the undertray of the car which effectively ended any chance of competing for a points scoring position, and Hamilton finished the race in 18th and last place with Kovalainen <b>scraping</b> into the <b>points</b> in 8th.|$|R
50|$|During {{preparations}} for this game, on September 30, the MVIAA announced {{that for the}} first time ever, freshmen athletes would be permitted to participate in football games, at least in the interim time period while so many of the experienced players were called away due to the war effort or unavailable because of the influenza epidemic. Both teams implemented personnel changes to plug in the freshmen, and thus both teams were untested machines when they finally met. Nebraska looked alive when they reached the Iowa 2-yard line in the first quarter, but the Hawkeyes held strong and sent Nebraska away with no points. It was the last time the Cornhuskers posed a serious threat to Iowa, who <b>scraped</b> together 18 <b>points</b> later in the game to open Nebraska's season with a shutout loss, though the Cornhuskers still controlled the series with a 12-5-3 edge.|$|R
50|$|Co-hosts New Zealand {{proved the}} {{surprise}} packet of the tournament, winning their first seven games to finish {{on top of}} the table after the round robin. The other hosts, Australia, were one of the pre-tournament favorites but lost their first two matches. They recovered somewhat to win four of the remaining six, but narrowly missed out on the semi-finals. The West Indies also finished with a 4-4 record, but were just behind Australia on run-rate. South Africa made a triumphant return to international cricket with a win over Australia at the SCG in their first match. They and England had solid campaigns and easily qualified for the semis, despite upset losses to Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe respectively. India had a disappointing tournament and never looked likely to progress beyond the round robin. Sri Lanka were still establishing themselves at the highest level and beat only Zimbabwe (who did not yet have Test status) and South Africa. New Zealand were defeated only twice in the tournament, both times by Pakistan, in their final group match and in the semi-final. Pakistan had been lucky to be in the semi-finals at all: following only one victory in their first five matches, they were also fortunate to <b>scrape</b> a <b>point</b> from the washed-out match against England which appeared to be heading for a heavy English victory (Pak 74 all out, Eng 24/1): eventually they finished one point ahead of Australia with an inferior run-rate.|$|R
5000|$|The {{person that}} scrapes {{is called a}} [...] "hand". It is done by using a {{precision}} surface such as a surface plate or a straight edge as a standard (a straight edge {{in this context is}} not a ruler; it is a miniature surface plate of extreme accuracy). The standard is coated with a very thin coating of a material such as Prussian blue. The work piece and standard are touched together by gravity alone and the high spots on the work piece will be colored by the dye on the standard. These high spots are scraped off and the process repeated until there is an even spread of high spots which total about 60% or more of the surface area. Coarse scraping gives a resulting surface with 5-10 points per square inch while fine <b>scraping</b> yields 24-36 <b>points</b> per square inch. If desired the surface can then be “Frosted”. A surface prepared in this way is superior in overall accuracy to any prepared by machining or grinding operations, although lapping can equal or exceed it over small distances. Grinding and machining stresses the metal thermally and mechanically, scraping and lapping do not.|$|R
50|$|You {{start with}} surface plate A and surface plate B {{make sure that}} all sides have no burrs on them and that it is clean. You can even use your hand to feel for {{anything}} and if so clean it off and deburr it before proceeding. Take surface plate B or A but only one of them and use blue dye with a dye spotting tool and rub the plate down with it until its completely and nicely coated on the unfinished surface of that plate. Take the other uncoated plate and make sure there is no burrs or dirt, then put the uncoated surface plate on to the coated blue dye surface plate make sure to only softly put it on the coated plate. Rub the two plates together a couple of times to ensure the coated surface plate makes contact with the uncoated surface plate and highlights the high points of the uncoated surface plate. softly and slowly take off the surface plate with the high points highlighted with blue dye. Use a hand scraper and <b>scrape</b> the high <b>points</b> highlighted with blue dye. Repeat the process until the scraped surface plate has a uniformed surface highlighted with blue dye.|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, the American Commodore Alexander J. Dallas arrested Captain Brown and {{his crew}} for piracy when they sailed into New Orleans that May for provisioning. The charges were {{eventually}} dropped {{because all of the}} seized American ships carried Mexican military stores, but a civil suit remained in litigation for years afterward. Texan authorities took the time to purchase the Pocket and both the ship and her cargo were used against the Mexicans. On April 3, the Invincible attacked the Mexican ship Montezuma off Matamoros. Captain Brown ordered his men to open fire while the schooner maneuvered in circles around the Montezuma until she ran aground and sank. On April 11, the privateer Flash picked up the refugees and survivors of the Runaway <b>Scrape</b> at Morgan's <b>Point,</b> including members of President David G. Burnet's family. The next significant event of the conflict, which had an effect on the naval campaign, was the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. In it, General Houston led an attack on the Mexican Army and routed them, in the process capturing General Santa Anna, who was then forced to sign a treaty recognizing the independence of Texas. The fighting on land was over at that point but because the Mexican government never ratified the Treaty of Velasco, the naval campaign continued for another year.|$|R
