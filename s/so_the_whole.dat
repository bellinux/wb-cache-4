Andrae Crouch's Choir and Jackson engage in a back and forth chant as the song reaches its climactic finale. Jackson's intent {{was to create a}} song that was lyrically deep yet melodically simple, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> world, particularly non-English-speaking fans, could sing along. He conceptualized a song that had an emotional message.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the natural world {{extended}} to a detailed examination of plants. The work done was directly useful in the unprecedented growth of pharmacology across the Islamic world. Al-Dinawari popularised botany in the Islamic world with his six-volume Kitab al-Nabat (Book of Plants). Only volumes 3 and 5 have survived, with part of volume 6 reconstructed from quoted passages. In what survives, 637 plants are described in alphabetical order from the letters sin to ya, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> book must have covered several thousand kinds of plants. Al-Dinawari described the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit. Zakariya al-Qazwini's thirteenth century encyclopedia ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt (The Wonders of Creation) contained, among many other topics, both realistic botany and fantastic accounts. For example, he described trees which grew birds on their twigs in place of leaves, but which could only be found in the far-distant British Isles. The use and cultivation of plants was documented in the 11th century by Muhammad bin Ibrāhīm Ibn Bassāl of Toledo in his book Dīwān al-filāha (The Court of Agriculture), and Ibn al-'Awwam al-Ishbīlī of Seville in his 12th century book Kitāb al-Filāha (Treatise on Agriculture). Ibn Bassāl had travelled widely across the Islamic world, returning with a detailed knowledge of agronomy. His practical and systematic book describes over 180 plants and how to propagate and care for them. It covered leaf and root vegetables, herbs, spices and trees. Abū l-Khayr described in minute detail how olive trees should be grown, grafted, treated for disease, and harvested. He gave similar detail for crops such as cotton.|$|E
25|$|In general, some subsets {{of a set}} in L {{will not}} be in L. <b>So</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> power set of a set in L will usually not be in L.

Then the intersection is {z | z∈Lα and z is a subset of x} ∈ Lα+1. Thus the required set is in L.|$|E

25|$|As {{was normal}} practice, the gunners 'stood to' at 06.30 {{and so were}} ready for action when the German {{warships}} approached. The Germans planned to bombard the batteries for 15 minutes to suppress them before turning the attention to the town. The Seydlitz opened fire at 08.10 and Lt-Col Robson rushed from his home to take up his post as Fire Commander and Battery Medical Officer at Heugh Battery. The first shell cut the Fire Commander's telephone lines, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> action was fought by the Battery Commanders on their own under standing orders. At ranges of 4000 to 5000 yards the German shells fell round the batteries without scoring a direct hit. Heugh Battery engaged first the Seydlitz and then the Moltke until they passed out of its arc of fire, and then concentrated on the stationary Blucher which was firing at Lighthouse Battery. Lighthouse Battery scored a direct hit on Blucher's forebridge, disabling two guns of the secondary armament, but suffered a number of misfires due to an electrical fault.|$|E
25|$|The QAPF diagram {{has four}} {{minerals}} or mineral groups chosen as important cornerstones of the classification. These are quartz (Q), Alkali feldspars (A), plagioclase feldspars (P), and feldspathoids (F). F and Q for chemical reasons {{can not exist}} together in one plutonic rock. Other minerals may and almost certainly occur in these rocks as well {{but they have no}} significance in this classification scheme. <b>So,</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> diagram is actually composed of two ternary plots (QAP and FAP). To use the classification, the concentration (the mode) of these minerals must be known and recalculated to make their sum 100%. For example: a plutonic rock that contains no alkali feldspar and no feldspathoids but contains lots of pyroxenes (neglected in this diagram), plagioclase feldspar and few quartz grains is probably gabbro (located at the right edge of the diagram, near P). This diagram does not determine whether a rock is gabbro, diorite, or anorthosite. There are another criteria used to decide that. Note that this diagram is not used for all plutonic rocks. Ultramafic rocks are the most important plutonic rocks that have separate classification diagrams.|$|E

500|$|Deriving from [...] "the biting {{humor of}} Ray Davies and the {{bitterness}} of Paul Weller", Albarn's lyrics on Modern Life Is Rubbish are a social commentary and satire on contemporary suburban English life. While Rubbish celebrates modern British life, it also takes a cynical look at middle-class existence. The overt Anglo-centricism of the album was also retaliation against American popular culture; James later explained, [...] "it was f***ing scary how American everything's becoming ... <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing was a f***ing big two fingers up to America". NME summarised {{the theme of the}} [...] "thinly-veiled concept album" [...] as a [...] "London odyssey crammed full of strange commuters, peeping Thomases and lost dreams; of opening the windows and breathing in petrol ...

The ground was hard coral, which was good for airbase {{construction}} but {{made it difficult to}} dig foxholes. The twelve [...]50calibre (12.7mm) machine guns were positioned in the front line. There was fighting throughout the night as small groups of Japanese attempted to infiltrate the position. An airdrop of ammunition was requested. A break in the weather allowed three B-25s of the 38th U.S. Bomb Group to drop supplies at 08:30. Four B-17s of the 375th Troop Carrier Group each dropped three tons of supplies, including blood plasma, ammunition, hand grenades, and barbed wire. Some of the ammunition fell beyond the perimeter but for some reason men who moved out to retrieve it were not fired upon.|$|E

The cans were then soldered shut. For a workforce, Pegram secured the services of Columbia's football team. It was the custom at the time for football players to perform odd jobs around the university. They were able to manipulate the heavy cans with ease. The final result was a disappointing k of 0.87.|$|E

Digital Spy revealed that the week-long 6000th episode celebrations would see the wedding of regular characters, Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie) and Ringo Brown (Sam Clark). It was later announced that an attempt on the life of long term regular, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) would be the focus of the actual 6000th episode. Bower said [...] "Last week I saw episode 6,000. This marks Australian television history. The 6,000th episode falls on a Friday <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> week is a special one.

The artists were reported to be wearing fashionable dresses, with Knowles in [...] "a feathered dress" [...] and Gaga sporting [...] "something wild". In an interview with New York's Z100 radio station, Gaga further commented on her collaboration with Knowles, for the music video.

500|$|Les Jackson {{took over}} command of No.75 Squadron {{the day after}} his brother was killed. Although the {{squadron}} was no longer an effective fighting unit, it had checked Japan's attempts to overpower Port Moresby by air attack, and the town continued to function as an important Allied base. John Jackson was survived by his wife and children, and interred in Moresby's Bomana War Cemetery. His estate was sworn for probate at a value of £29,780 ($1,870,800 in 2011). [...] His name appears on panel 104 of the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial (AWM), Canberra. [...] Jackson was a keen amateur film maker, and a four-minute reel of 16mm footage that he shot in Port Moresby is held by the AWM. Moresby's Seven Mile Aerodrome was renamed Jackson's Strip in his honour; it later became Jacksons International Airport. In a 1989 interview, fellow No.75 Squadron member Flight Lieutenant Albert Tucker commented, [...] "I would say that had JohnF. Jackson not existed, the squadron would not have been effective in that defence role {{for as long as it}} was... <b>So</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> spirit of JohnF's leadership, and I suppose his final sacrifice, was the thing that made 75 Squadron."
