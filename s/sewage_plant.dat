25|$|The city {{did provide}} one large {{construction}} project, though not so favored by residents. Starting in the 1960s and continuing through the 1970s, Harlemites fought {{the introduction of}} an immense sewage treatment plant, the North River Water Pollution Control Plant, on the Hudson River in West Harlem. A compromise was ultimately reached in which the plant was built with a state park, including extensive recreational facilities, on top. The park, called Riverbank State Park, was opened in 1993 (the <b>sewage</b> <b>plant</b> having been completed some years earlier).|$|E

25|$|In the CMWU damage {{assessment}} report, waste water networks in Gaza City, Beit Hanoun, Jabalia, and Beit Lahia have sustained severe damage. The Ash Sheikh 'Ijleen <b>sewage</b> <b>plant</b> which treats the raw sewage {{of an area}} inhabited by 400,000 people {{has been out of}} order since it was struck by a shell in the second week of the conflict. The final report of the {{damage assessment}} carried out by the CMWU reveals that repairing the water and wastewater network and facilities will cost approximately 6 million US dollars, including 830,000 dollars to repair the wastewater network. According to the Palestinian Hydrology Group, solid waste is accumulating in most areas affected by the hostilities, with the exception of Gaza city where only two areas face problems with solid waste. The group also reported that on 13 February, 3,000 litres of fuel had leaked into wastewater infiltration basin of the Beit Lahia emergency wastewater treatment plant, posing a risk for chemical contamination of the aquifer by hydrocarbons. Major repairs can not take place without the entry of needed spare parts into Gaza, which remains problematic.|$|E

500|$|Sophiatown was {{originally}} {{part of the}} Waterfall farm. Over time it included the neighbouring areas of Martindale and Newclare. It was purchased by a speculator, Hermann Tobiansky, in 1897. He acquired 237acres four miles or so west of the centre of Johannesburg. The private leasehold township was surveyed in 1903 and divided into almost 1700 small stands. The township was named after Tobiansky's wife, Sophia, {{and some of the}} streets were named after his children Toby, Gerty, Bertha and Victoria. Before the enactment of the Natives Land Act, 1913, black South Africans had freehold rights, and they bought properties in the suburb. The distance from the city centre was seen as disadvantageous and after the City of Johannesburg built a <b>sewage</b> <b>plant</b> nearby, the area seemed even less attractive. [...] Because of these and other reasons most of the whites had moved out by 1920, leaving behind a vibrant multi-racial community. By the late 1940s Sophiatown had a population of nearly 54000 Black Africans, 3000 Coloureds, 1500 Indians and 686 Chinese.|$|E
500|$|In {{regulations}} {{adopted in}} 1985 and amended in 2008, New York's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) divides the river into four water-quality regions {{similar to those}} in the 1983 USGS study.

It is considered Saline Class B surface water, to be kept suitable for primary and secondary contact recreation such as swimming, boating and fishing, and capable of supporting [...] "fish, shellfish and wildlife propagation and survival." [...] The next section extends to the tailwater at the Yonkers <b>sewage</b> <b>plant</b> impoundment, and is Class C fresh water, with the same purposes, to the extent that [...] "other factors" [...] do not limit them. From there to the Woodlands Lake inlet is the third section, designated as Class A fresh water, to be kept clean enough for drinking. The remainder to the source is the fourth section, designated Class B, or fresh water kept to the same standards as the salt water above the river's mouth. Tributaries, named and unnamed, and subtributaries are generally held to the same standards as the section into which they drain.|$|E
500|$|The city of Roanoke, Virginia had {{experienced}} a series of major floods that affected. The floods caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972 prompted a study that would channelize [...] of the Roanoke River to increase water capacity. After the 1985 floods, the city council sought assistance from the USACE to build flood walls and improve river flow to mitigate against future flooding. The agency estimated that the project would cut the damage in half for a flood similar to the 1985 one. The cost for the project was initially project to be $34.4million, of which the city was expected to pay $14.3million. Private land donations and other financial sources provided about $6.8million of the cost, while the remaining $7.5million was covered by a bond, approved in an April 1989 single-issue referendum. This was the first such referendum for the city, and passed with 56.6% in support amid a voter turnout of 19.6%. The bond would be repaid by a 2% raise of the utility tax. Construction began in 1990, and that year a flood warning system was completed. In 1993, Roanoke's raw <b>sewage</b> <b>plant</b> and hospital finished flood proofing. The bulk {{of the project was}} finished in December 2011 when the final terrain cuts were made. When the project was completed, the USGS estimated that the annual damage from flooding decreased from $5.8million to $2.7million, and that the work prevented major floods in November 2009 from Hurricane Ida and January 2013. Also in the state, the General Assembly passed the [...] "Virginia Flood Damage Reduction Act" [...] in 1989, partly due to the flooding from 1985; this coordinated all work related to flood prevention throughout the state into one department.|$|E

40|$|In {{many rural}} regions, {{there is a}} lack of orderly sewage disposal. Due to the high {{building}} costs of sewers, a connection to central <b>sewage</b> <b>plants</b> is usually not defensible. In this case, a decentralised sewage disposal provides a economical solution. The planner of such a disposal has to find a favourable allocation structure of <b>sewage</b> <b>plants</b> and sewers as well as a favourable wastewater treatment technology for a specific plant location. These tasks both can not be solved separately since the chosen structure considerably influences the set of admissible technologies. The Technology, information and Consulting System for Decentralised <b>Sewage</b> <b>Plants</b> (TECIS) supports the planner solving this planning problem. TECIS can be used in two modes. In the information mode the user can investigate various information concerning waste water treatment. The consulting mode gives active support for solving the planner's decision problem. From the description of the places to be disposed and the pot ential locations for the <b>sewage</b> <b>plants</b> the set of feasible structures is generated. For each structure the feasible wastewater treatment technologies are chosen from a knowledge component and rated by some objective functions determined by the user. In this way a set of alternatives for the planning problem is generated. By means of several methods the planner can choose a best alternative of sewage disposal for the given region...|$|R

[...] Errichetti called for a primarily state or federally funded <b>sewage</b> <b>plant,</b> which would have costed $14 million, and a region-wide collection of trash-waste. [...] The <b>sewage</b> <b>plant</b> was a necessity {{in order to meet the}} requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act, as per the changes implemented to the act in 1972. [...] James Joyce, chair of the county's Democratic Party at the time, had his own ambitions in regard to establishing a sewage authority that clashed with Errichetti's. [...] While Errichetti formed his sewage authority through his own power, Joyce required the influence of the Camden County Board of Chosen Freeholders in order to form his. [...] Errichetti and Joyce competed against each other to gain the cooperation of Camden's suburban communities, with Errichetti ultimately succeeding.

2500|$|Beginning in the 19th century, with {{increasing}} mining and agriculture upstream and urban sewage and runoff downstream, {{the water quality}} of the Potomac River deteriorated. This created conditions of severe eutrophication. It is said that President Abraham Lincoln used to escape to the highlands on summer nights to escape the river's stench. In the 1960s, with dense green algal blooms covering the river's surface, President Lyndon Johnson declared the river [...] "a national disgrace" [...] and {{set in motion a}} long-term effort to reduce pollution from sewage and restore the beauty and ecology of this historic river. One of significant pollution control projects at the time was the expansion of the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant, which serves Washington and several surrounding communities. Enactment of the 1972 Clean Water Act led to construction or expansion of additional sewage treatment plants in the Potomac watershed.

2500|$|Situated on the Delaware River waterfront, {{the city}} of Camden {{contains}} many pollution-causing facilities, such as a trash incinerator and a <b>sewage</b> <b>plant.</b> [...] Despite the additions of new waste-water and trash treatment facilities in the 1970s and 1980s, pollution in the city remains an issue due to faulty waste disposal practices and outdated sewer systems. The open-air nature of the waste treatment plants cause the smell of sewage and other toxic fumes to permeate through the air. [...] This has encouraged local grass roots organizations to protest {{the development of these}} plants in Camden. The development of traffic-heavy highway systems between Philadelphia and South Jersey also contributed to the rise of air pollution in the area. Water contamination has been an issue in Camden for decades. [...] In the 1970s, dangerous pollutants were found near the Delaware River at the Puchack Well Field, where many Camden citizens received their household water from, decreasing property values in Camden and causing health problems among the city's residents. [...] Materials contaminating the water included cancer-causing metals and chemicals, affecting as many as 50,000 people between the early 1970s and late 1990s, when the six Puchack wells were officially shut down and declared a Superfund site.
