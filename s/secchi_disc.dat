40|$|Abstract: Many {{aquatic organisms}} survive by filter feeding from the {{surrounding}} water and capturing food particles. We developed a laboratory exercise that allows students to measure the effects of filtering by fresh water mussels on water turbidity. Mussels were acquired from Wards Scientific and exposed to a solution of baker’s yeast. Over a period of one to two hours, students measured changes in water clarity using miniature <b>Secchi</b> <b>discs.</b> The exercise {{has been used in}} a freshwater biology class at a state university. This exercise allows students to make hypotheses, gather data, and explore interactions between living organisms and their environment. Many North American species of freshwater mussels are threatened or endangered because of habitat changes and the introduction of exotic mussels. Therefore, students are also able to examine the potential effects of biodiversity loss in aquatic environments. Key words: freshwater mussel, macroinvertebrate, filter feeding, ecolog...|$|R

A remote sensing database was established for the Mecklenburg Lake District in 1997 comprising field reflectance and analytical reference data on several distinct dates and airborne hyperspectral data recorded by the Compact Airborne Hyperspectral Imager (casi). The in situ reflectance spectra were analysed to develop and test a model for hyperspectral determination of the phytopigments chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, and carotenoids, and <b>Secchi</b> <b>disc</b> depth. For <b>Secchi</b> <b>disc</b> depth the area between a base line and the spectrum from 400 nm to 750 nm was calculated and correlated to the <b>Secchi</b> <b>disc</b> depth measured in situ. Chlorophyll-a concentration was quantified using the reflectance ratio at 705 nm and 678 nm and showed a linear relationship to chlorophyll-a content from laboratory spectro-photometric measurements. The accessory phytopigments carotenoids and phycocyanin were determined from the spectral data using their absorption depths at 485 nm and 624 nm, respectively. The algorithms have then been transferred to the hyperspectral airborne data.

Seasonal results of the <b>Secchi</b> <b>disc</b> measurements (spring, summer) for 706 lakes were gathered. This is more than 68 % {{of the total number of}} Polish lakes with a surface area larger than 50 ha. The mean water transparency of these lakes was 1. 87 m, while the median was 1. 58 m. Distinct inter-regional differences of the <b>Secchi</b> <b>disc</b> transparency were found, and it was also possible to distinguish three relatively homogeneous groups of macroregions where lakes have different optical characteristics. They can be divided into areas with lakes with high (3. 05 m), medium (1. 99 - 2. 11 m) and low (1. 22 - 1. 52 m) water transparency. The <b>Secchi</b> <b>disc</b> transparency of these lakes was also analysed in relation to concentration values of the main forms of the optically significant constituents of water (coloured dissolved organic matter, suspended matter). The mean transparency of turbid, stained and clear lakes was, respectively, 1. 16, 2. 02, and 2. 92 m. Moreover, regional empirical models to predict <b>Secchi</b> <b>disc</b> transparency from chlorophyll a concentration were also developed.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Linear regression of <b>secchi</b> <b>disc</b> visibility against {{number of sets}} yielded significant results {{in a number of}} instances. The variability seen in the slope of the regression lines is due to the nonuniformity of sample size. The longer the period sampled, the larger the total number of attempts. Further, {{there is no reason to}} expect either the influence of transparency or of other variables to remain constant throughout the season. However, the fact that the data for the entire season, variable as it is, was significant at the 5 % level, suggests its potential utility for predictive modeling.

Tubidity and suspended sediment measurements made in the Gulf of the Farallones correlate well with water tonal patterns visible on satellite imagery.
