60|$|The doctor {{stepped around}} so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> and nodded.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> She felt {{as though}} she had picked his pocket.|$|E
60|$|He checked himself; {{but he was}} wishing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in his pulpit.|$|E
60|$|Devine {{seemed to}} smile, though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> very well.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> A pillar hid the chancel {{from her}} view.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{woman that}} {{had met the}} king on the way {{followed}} him to the monastery, and wanted to see the king. They told her <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> <b>She</b> said she must <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> They told her that at any rate <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> then--he was tired with his journey. She must go away, they said, and come the next day. So she went away; but she told them they would all be sorry for not letting her in." ...|$|R
60|$|She laughed, {{and moved}} her parasol a little so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> better.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> brace himself. She {{could feel}} him brace his very body ere he answered.|$|E
60|$|Juliette's large, burning {{eyes were}} {{gradually}} piercing the semi-gloom around her. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> distinctly now, standing close beside her, in {{an attitude of}} the deepest, almost reverential respect.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The weather blows in here,' he said, coming {{steadily}} forward, {{feeling for}} the doors. She shrank away. At last <b>she</b> <b>could</b> dimly <b>see</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|He was {{standing}} immediately {{inside the door}} at the bottom, though it was so dark <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> The villagers were audibly talking just without.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> very well, for {{his head}} was silhouetted against the {{dazzling}} light beyond, and she frowned a little {{as she tried to}} distinguish his features more clearly in the shadow.|$|R
60|$|Joan did {{not speak}} for a time. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> grave--a little pompous, in his Sunday black, his {{footsteps}} creaking down the stone-flagged aisle, the silver-edged collecting bag held stiffly in his hand.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not long}} before she had to uncover them again. Savonarola was there. He was not far off her now. He had mounted the steps; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> look round on the multitude.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the dusk}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> straighten, {{and his voice}} came sharp as he ignored the ever-present parental {{background}} and retorted, [...] "Somebody {{has got to be}} cheerful. Matter fact, I worked out the right stunt, coming down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know who}} you mean," [...] Mary said, after a moment's silence, [...] "but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> even if she were his wife. He is asleep now and {{everything}} depends upon his sleep being unbroken." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Macnab's {{back was}} {{turned to the}} savage, but not having the {{advantage}} of the glass, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> and continued her pleasant prattle. Like a dark, noiseless shadow, the Indian advanced, and raised his knife.|$|R
60|$|The girl, when <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer}} <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> dashed away, and, sobbing violently, entered the house.|$|R
60|$|Amelius told Sally {{to wait in}} the cab. She saw his altered looks, and entreated him not {{to leave}} her. He promised to keep the house door open so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> while he was away from her, and hastened into the hall.|$|E
60|$|His {{companion}} {{had put the}} lanthorn down on the step, and by {{its light}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> distinctly: a mysterious, masked figure who, with wanton infamy, had placed the satisfaction of his dishonesty and of his greed athwart the destiny of the King of France.|$|E
60|$|But happily, {{now that}} he had given him the wink, the Herr could corroborate it himself by going to the theater tonight. Ah, {{it would be a great}} joke--quite colossal! if he took a front seat where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> And the good man rubbed his hands in gleeful anticipation.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> but <b>she</b> {{felt the}} beloved {{presence}} there, somewhere close to her, {{and she knew}} that he would wish her to wait.... She watched him silently... ready to help if he called... equally ready to remain still and to wait.|$|R
50|$|Unknown to Nancy, Roger {{had been}} seeing other women, {{especially}} when Nancy and Ann visited Sue. His relationships became more noticeable, and strained their relationship. When Nancy developed a crush on Michael Derosier, she told Roger <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> anymore, and took up with Derosier.|$|R
60|$|Helena swiftly, with a {{movement}} of terror, faced him, looking into his eyes. But {{he was in the}} shadow, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> The flat sound of his voice, lacking resonance--the dead, expressionless tone--made her lose her presence of mind. She stared at him blankly.|$|R
6000|$|Ransom {{moved closer}} to her, placed himself where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> better. [...] "It's {{a great thing to}} have the true system," [...] he said, bending towards her in a {{friendly}} way; [...] "I'm sure you have it in everything." [...] He was not often hypocritical; but when he was he went all lengths.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Nesbit {{had taken}} {{occasion}} {{to speak of}} the reversion of an estate, which she said she wished to go to augment the property of the title; and now she should have no hesitation in bequeathing it to him, provided <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> on his side, make such a connection as would be for the consequence of the family.|$|E
60|$|She {{would not}} let his father say {{anything}} to him, {{but after a while}} she washed him, and when she got him clean she made him up a bed on the lounge and put him to sleep there where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> She said {{she was not going to}} sleep herself that night, but just stay up and realize that they had got Pony safe again.|$|E
60|$|Then Sir Ewaine {{went to her}} {{and laid}} his hand upon her {{shoulder}} as she had bidden him to do, and thereupon {{she knew that he}} was there though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> So straightway she arose and went forth from out of the garden and Sir Ewaine followed her.|$|R
60|$|So Jeekie {{translated}} {{in a great}} hurry, {{telling her}} what Alan had said, and adding on his own account that he, silly white man that he was, could not understand how, as she was quite a young woman, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> before <b>she</b> was born. If that were so, she would be old and ugly now, not beautiful as she was.|$|R
60|$|She {{realized}} then, {{with one}} of those sudden quivers of her sensibilities, to which, alas! she had become so accustomed of late, that he had always met her thus in the gloom--always chosen nights when <b>she</b> <b>could</b> scarce <b>see</b> <b>him</b> distinctly, and this recollection still further enhanced that eerie feeling of terror which had assailed her since that fateful moment in the vestry.|$|R
60|$|Lawford {{could see}} his wife--every tint and curve and line as {{distinctly}} as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> Her cheeks never had much colour; now her whole face visibly darkened, from pallor to a dusky leaden grey, as she gazed. It was not an illusion then; not a miserable hallucination. The unbelievable, the inconceivable, had happened. He replaced the candles with trembling fingers and sat down.|$|E
60|$|Grace {{wanted to}} call him back, but somehow could not, and sat still while he crossed the lawn. So long as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> he moved carelessly, but when he went down the drive behind a clipped hedge his step got slow {{and his face was}} hard. The thing he meant to do would need some pluck, and might be {{dangerous}} if he had not judged Askew right.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Brown {{met him at}} the door; and {{she looked}} so good and motherly, and there was such a {{peculiar}} wistful look in her eyes, that {{he put his arm around}} her in a sudden impulse and kissed her. It made her lips tremble, and she was obliged to wipe her glasses before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> clearly. Supper was on the table for him, and she made him sit right down.|$|E
60|$|The {{third time}} there was a dense fog; she looked around, but without much hope. Even if he had been walking within twenty yards of her <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not have <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Left {{to himself}} {{again with a}} still higher sense of the {{importance}} of his post, and stimulated to enthusiasm by the special notice and encouragement of his leader, Barnaby walked to and fro in a delicious trance rather than as a waking man. The sunshine which prevailed around was in his mind. He had but one desire ungratified. If <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>him</b> now! ...|$|R
6000|$|She marched {{over to the}} door. She {{flung it}} open. The man started back. He was holding an electric, torch. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> but to the {{hovering}} ball of light she remarked, [...] "Two men, friends of mine, are below, by their car. You will go at once, or I'll call them. If you think I am bluffing, go down and look. Good night!" ...|$|R
