But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that she was not going to go quietly or willingly. It was just the two of us hanging out [...] she was very funny. We didn't have to [...] because I always knew how she felt about me. I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn't have to have these heart to heart talks.|$|E
