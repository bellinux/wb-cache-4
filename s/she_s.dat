40|$|The motive {{by which}} working persons entered a {{graduate}} school. I thought their motive gives us suggestion for inquiry to {{a way to}} propulsion of social worker s recurrent education. And so I look for why she tried to enter a graduate school {{from the inside of}} life history of an activist in a consumer movement, and I was changed for a social work about the motive and backing and consideration was tried. As a result, she was 79 years old, and the direct opportunity which determined on entrance to a master s course was as follows. The fact that her junior of a consumer movement entered a school by an entrance examination for working persons. The next fact that an entrance examination for working persons was performed by the theme in which <b>she</b> <b>s</b> interested in the next year. She had a collapse experience in a social action 17 years ago as an internal motive. And she had the will which would like to conquer that and a strong desire to the self-actualization which would like to decide its course by oneself. That it can make the sense as a place to grant the life-style chosen personally for the person who tries to investigate a theme of the self-education which sprouted up from the inside of social experience became clear in a graduate school from being it. ソーシャルワーカーのリカレント教育を推進する方途を探る上で、社会人が大学院進学を決意した動機を実例から丁寧に汲み取ることが示唆をもたらすものと考えた。そこで、一人の消費者運動家の生活史の中から、「なぜ大学院で学ぼうとしたのか」を探り、その動機と背景についてソーシャルワークに照応させながら検討を試みた。その結果、 79 歳で修士課程への進学を決意した直接の契機は、消費者運動の後輩が社会人入試で進学したことと、その翌年、自分の関心のあるテーマで社会人入試の募集が行われたことだが、内面的な動機として、 17 年前のソーシャルアクションにおける挫折体験があり、それを克服したいという積年の問題意識と、自分の進路を自分で決めたいという自己実現への強い欲求が認められた。社会経験の中から芽生えた自己教育のテーマを探究しようとする者にとって、大学院は自ら選び取った生き方を叶える場としての意味を持ち得ることが示唆された...|$|E

40|$|Laurie Stras's edited volume She's So Fine: Reflections on Whiteness, Femininity, Adolescence and Class in 1960 s Music is {{a welcome}} {{addition}} to the recent scholarship on music by female musicians of the 1960 s that attends {{to the complexity of}} the women and girls who performed and listened to this music in the United States and the United Kingdom. So unexplored is this area of inquiry from a musicological standpoint that, in her introduction, Stras appropriately envisions She's So Fine to be the "beginning of a re-evaluation-with emphasis on value-of the very premises of 1950 s and 1960 s pop". By extension, Stras's ambitions for the book not only necessitate an interrogation of the merits of the popular music canon, but also call for a reconsideration of the standard criteria for assigning and naturalizing value wherever it calcifies. The pop music of women musicians in the 1960 s has, critically and in general popular thought, been denigrated for its polish and mass appeal. Celebrated volumes on rock history such as The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll, (2001) or Robert Palmer's Rock and Roll: An Unruly History (1995) have participated in the dismissal of girl groups by crediting their success to the complex labor force of producers and song-writers "behind" the musicians. Stras observes that "Pop and its attendant girlspace, with their alleged emphasis on conformity and concomitant lack of authenticity, have been noted as a phenomenon, but one that always seems to operate as a foil to prove rock's ultimate superior cultural worth". The most troubling problem posed by these gendered constructions of ' 60 s genres is not so much that popular music is consistently gendered "female"-for as Stras observes, pop music was indeed a space dominated by teenage girls who represented the target audience but that this feminization simultaneously becomes a marker of conformity, lack, or devaluation. Clearly, the diminished social status of adolescent girls in Western culture is one explanation for the motivations behind this discursive and political suppression of ' 60 s girl pop and the heterogeneity of the girl singers in question. <b>She</b> <b>s</b> So Fine, therefore, is a valuable feminist work because it resonates as the unequivocal rejoinder to all of the pejorative connotations that justifY the reduction and dismissal of the category of "girl" from androcentric histories of popular culture...|$|E
40|$|Esse trabalho constitui uma investigação sobre os recursos coesivos usados em narrativas produzidas por crianças do terceiro ano do Ensino Fundamental. Para versar sobre tal temática optamos por analisar o uso dos termos ele (s) e ela(s), já que os mesmos são bastante recorrentes nas produções apresentadas pelos alunos dos anos iniciais. Tomamos por base a Teoria das Operações Predicativas e Enunciativa apresentada pelo linguista Antoine Culioli e também recorremos à leitura de textos de estudiosos que fundamentam seus trabalhos na referida teoria enunciativa. Mostramos que qualquer materialização linguística, e, portanto, as que apresentam a questão coesiva por nós focalizada, traduz um complexo processo linguístico-cognitivo do sujeito e observamos que, muitas vezes, a utilização dos termos ele(s) e ela(s) associada a todas as outras marcas do enunciado acentua o caráter indeterminado e ambíguo da linguagem. Isso ocorre, sobretudo, quando o conjunto de marcas escolhido e utilizado não se mostra suficiente para determinar o dizer, o que significa que a coesão textual se dá pelo uso de todas as marcas do enunciado e não apenas por meio da relação entre termos específicos. O trabalho que propomos justifica-se pela necessidade de se entender o processo de significação como resultado da atividade de linguagem e de se pensar a questão coesiva de modo que se supere a polarização e a ênfase dada apenas à língua enquanto produto, mas como resultante da atividade do sujeito, o que pressupõe a articulação entre linguagem e língua e léxico e gramática. This work is an {{investigation}} of the features used in cohesive narratives produced by children in the third year of elementary school. To examine this issue, we chose to analyze the use of terms he (s) and <b>she</b> (<b>s),</b> since they are quite recurrent in productions presented by students of the early years, based on the Theory of Predicative and Enunciative Operations presented by linguist Antoine Culioli and also texts by scholars who base their work on that enunciative theory. We represent that any linguistic materialization and therefore those having the question we focused by cohesive, reflecting a complex linguistic-cognitive process of the subject and found that often the use of the terms he (s) and her (s) associated all other marks of the statement emphasizes the character of indeterminate and ambiguous language. This occurs especially when the chosen mark set used by the students and does not determine the meaning, which means that text cohesion is through the use of all marks of utterance and not only through the relation between specific terms. The research is justified by the need to understand the process of meaning {{as a result of the}} activity of language and thinking about the cohesive marks so that we overcome the about the polarization and the emphasis the language as a product but as a result of activity of the subject, which requires the linkage between language and language and lexicon and grammar...|$|E
