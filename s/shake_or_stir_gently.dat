50|$|Commercially, makgeolli is most {{commonly}} available in plastic bottles or aseptic box containers. Traditionally, it is {{served in a}} large metal or wooden bowl from which individual cups and bowls are filled using a ladle. Korean jars also are a traditional vessel for makgeolli consumption. As it is an unfiltered beverage, makgeolli is generally <b>shaken</b> <b>or</b> <b>stirred</b> before being consumed, as the cloudy white portion tends to settle to the bottom, leaving a pale yellow-clear liquid on top.|$|R
25|$|Homogenization is {{a process}} that reduces the size of fat {{globules}} by forcing pressurized, hot milk through small holes, causing turbulence that breaks up the larger fat globules so that they remain suspended rather than separating in a cream layer at the top. The purpose of homogenization is to make milk more convenient to process, store and consume, eliminating the need to <b>shake</b> <b>or</b> <b>stir</b> the milk container to remix the separated cream layer and increasing the shelf-life of the product.|$|R

Gosling's Rum, {{which is based in}} Bermuda, publishes a recipe with two different rums from their brand line. [...] Rum, fruit juice (often including lime, and orange and pineapple juice), and a flavored sweetener such as falernum or grenadine are the most consistent ingredients, and the drink is generally <b>shaken</b> <b>or</b> <b>stirred</b> with ice.|$|R

500|$|A lemon drop is {{typically}} prepared straight up, {{meaning that it}} is <b>shaken</b> <b>or</b> <b>stirred</b> with ice, strained, and served in a stemmed glass, such as a martini glass. The glass may be prepared with a sugared rim, performed by dipping {{the rim of the}} glass in water or lemon juice and then dipping it into a rimmer (a shallow tray used in bartending), filled with sugar. Superfine sugar (also called [...] "bar sugar", [...] "caster sugar", [...] "castor sugar" [...] and [...] "ultrafine sugar"), which is more finely ground compared to standard granulated sugar, is sometimes used for this purpose.|$|R

But I say, how much more when a city hath foundations, twelve foundations, and those also laid by God himself; as it is said concerning the worthies of old, they 'looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God' (Heb 11:10).|$|R
40|$|Self-replicating {{molecules}} {{are likely}} to have {{played an important role in}} the origin of life, and a small number of fully synthetic self-replicators have already been described. Yet it remains an open question which factors most effectively bias the replication toward the far-from-equilibrium distributions characterizing even simple organisms. We report here two self-replicating peptide-derived macrocycles that emerge from a small dynamic combinatorial library and compete for a common feedstock. Replication is driven by nanostructure formation, resulting from the assembly of the peptides into fibers held together by beta sheets. Which of the two replicators becomes dominant is influenced by whether the sample is <b>shaken</b> <b>or</b> <b>stirred.</b> These results establish that mechanical forces can act as a selection pressure in the competition between replicators and can determine the outcome of a covalent synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Mixtures of {{granular}} media often exhibit {{size segregation}} along {{the axis of}} a partially-filled, horizontal, rotating cylinder. Previous experiments have observed axial bands of segregation that grow from concentration fluctuations and merge in a manner analogous to spinodal decomposition. We have observed that a new dynamical state precedes this effect in certain mixtures: bi-directional traveling waves. By preparing initial conditions, {{we found that the}} wave speed decreased with wavelength. Such waves appear to be inconsistent with simple PDE models which are first order in time. Typeset using REVTEX 1 Many heterogeneous granular materials stubbornly refuse to mix when <b>shaken</b> <b>or</b> <b>stirred.</b> [1, 2] Instead, the grains segregate by size. A simple apparatus, the horizontal drum mixer [3 – 11], dramatically illustrates this effect. A binary mixture of grain sizes partially fills a horizontal cylinder, which is then rotated about its axis. The components separate into bands arranged along the long axis of the cylinder. In all experiments reported so fa...|$|R
5000|$|The phrase first {{appears in}} the novel Diamonds Are Forever (1956), though Bond himself does not {{actually}} say it until Dr. No (1958), where his exact words are [...] "shaken and not stirred." [...] In the film adaptations of Fleming's novels, the phrase is first uttered by the villain, Dr. Julius No, when he offers the drink in Dr. No (1962), {{and it is not}} uttered by Bond himself (played by Sean Connery) until Goldfinger (1964). It is used in numerous Bond films thereafter with the notable exceptions of You Only Live Twice (1967), in which the drink is wrongly offered as [...] "stirred, not shaken," [...] to Bond's response [...] "that's right," [...] and Casino Royale (2006) in which Bond, after losing millions of dollars in a game of poker, is asked if he wants his martini <b>shaken</b> <b>or</b> <b>stirred</b> and snaps, [...] "Do I look like I give a damn?" ...|$|R
40|$|When a {{suspension}} of cellulose fibres in water is <b>shaken</b> <b>or</b> <b>stirred</b> with sufficient violence {{to produce a}} uniform dispersion and allowed to come to rest, {{it is observed that}} the dispersion tends to become less uniform in distribution of fibres. This important but little understood phenomenon is termed “flocculation” by analogy to the coagulation of a colloidal dispersion. Flocculation is usually undesirable during certain stages in the process of paper making. If it occurs during or just prior to the forming of the sheet on the wire of the paper machine, the pulp fibres are distributed unevenly and a non-uniform sheet results. When a sheet has a very poor “formation”, the ink is not distributed uniformly over the surface of the paper during the printing process. This prohibits the use of the paper in services where good reproduction is required. The strength and general appearance of paper are also determined, in large measure, by the formation. It is therefore of extreme importance that the principles of cellulose fibre flocculation be determined so that they may be available to the paper maker. There are other instances in which a more thorough knowledge of the principles of flocculation would be of value. In fibre recovery systems it is desirable to promote flocculation. In producing dissolving-grade pulps of uniform permeability and swelling properties it is of considerable importance to have the fibres uniformly dispersed when the pulp sheets are formed.

40|$|Enormous {{technical}} {{advances in}} imaging and data acquisition techniques, {{combined with a}} continuing increased scope for fluorescence labeling of specific constituents of living organisms, have brought about a revolution in approaches to biological problems. Whereas spatial organisation at an ultrastructural level would have seemed definitely the province of electron microscopy {{just a few years}} ago, now the new methods of light microscopy can offer not only a complementary approach, but can achieve more, especially in terms of noninvasive and real-time measurements. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is the most revolutionary development in optical microscopy since the early sevent eenth century. From the microbial ecologist’s point of view, the availability of this powerful new technique, which has been driven primarily by the needs of the biomedical sciences to define in situ in cells the interactions of ions, molecules and macromolecules, with membranes with a minimum of perturbation, could not be more timely. The past century has seen great advances in microbial physiology and biochemistry, mostly with organisms grown in suspension on rich media and at high growth rates. More recently there is a growing awareness that surface growth, nutrient deprivation, or pulsatile nutrient sufficiency are more realistic modes of laboratory cultivation with respect to the natural environment.
