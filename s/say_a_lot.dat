Fischer noted that the subplot featuring Jim unable to talk was important because [...] "Pam and Jim can <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to one another without any words at all", {{a reference to the}} [...] "27 seconds of silence" [...] the two shared in the earlier episode [...] "Booze Cruise". Michael has a bandage around his finger in this episode because Steve Carell hurt his finger during the week and was unable to remove his wedding ring due to the swelling. Instead of cutting off his ring, the crew simply wrapped a bandage around it.|$|E
500|$|On September 11, 1970, Hendrix {{gave his}} final {{interview}} in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where he talked with Keith Altham, a journalist for Record Mirror. During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even let that bother me. Because they <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy." [...] Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented psychedelic music, to which he laughed and replied: [...] "A mad scientist approach... I don't consider [...] the invention of psychedelic, it's just asking a lot of questions." ...|$|E
500|$|Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone {{wrote of}} the song: [...] "'You,' the single which preceded Extra Texture... {{is not only the}} best thing he has done since 1971's 'My Sweet Lord,' but also promised some of the {{prestige}} and credibility he lost with last year's sourvoiced album (Dark Horse) and fizzled tour." [...] In the NME, Neil Spencer opined: [...] "'You' seems at least to proclaim a return to energy. It has the kind of semi-Spector production that was spread all over All Things Must Pass. It bounds along OK, Harrison's double-tracked vocals gasp convincingly, and it deserves to be the hit that it will be." [...] Reviewing for Melody Maker, Ray Coleman highlighted Harrison's vocal and the musical contributions from Horn and Russell, and said: [...] "It's a dead cert disco smash, his finest single since 'My Sweet Lord'." [...] Coleman added that the lyrics were [...] "deceptively simple" [...] since, as with Harrison's 1969 composition [...] "Something", [...] "they <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> by saying a little." [...] Writing later in the 1970s, however, in their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler dismissed the song with the words: [...] "Doleful, lacklustre, [...] would-be singalongs which quite fail to arouse." ...|$|E

[...] Melton said that Sony has [...] "encouraged" [...] them to make it {{different}} from other films in the same genre. It was confirmed that Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, who are producing the Uncharted film, will be producing the movie via Atlas Entertainment. In early 2013, s Game Director, Todd Papy, {{said he did not}} know the status of the film. The writer behind the God of War video games, Marianne Krawczyk, said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos: [...] "The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more words. So I think it will be hard to get that across," [...] but she is hopeful that it can be done.

2500|$|Following the SPL Old Firm game of 24 October, Celtic twice {{wrote to}} the SFA to {{question}} the decisions made by referee William Collum, who also received death threats. Denying he was stoking up tension around refereeing decisions, Neil Lennon condemned the threats. He also claimed that the media reaction to his club's recent questioning of referees as having been blown out of proportion, and that their actions were {{not out of the}} ordinary compared to other clubs. On 3 November Celtic striker Gary Hooper claimed referees wanted to give decisions against his team. Lennon then received a two match touchline ban after heavily criticising decisions by referee Craig Thomson and his team during a 2–0 away defeat to Hearts on 10 November. Lennon stated after the game [...] "I'll seek clarification, but they'll probably have their story ready" [...] and [...] "Craig Thomson's supposed {{to be one of the}} best in the country.

2500|$|Tyler {{released}} {{one more}} album with Columbia Records in 1988. It was released {{under the name}} Hide Your Heart in Europe, and Notes From America in the United States. Prolific songwriters for the album included Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Desmond Child, who also produced the album. The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from Hide Your Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When looking back over this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've never even seen her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, so when she stands there and sings, she closes her eyes. She's in a sacred space and you feel that.

2500|$|Albini's lyrics drew {{criticism}} for apparent racism and homophobia. Racism {{was a frequent}} theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time. The word [...] "darkie" [...] appeared in {{the first line of}} the Lungs EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying [...] "in a way that's a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that's so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don't know." [...] He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word [...] "fag": [...] "Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word 'fag' isn't just a gay term, it's funny on its own — phonetically — like the words 'hockey puck,' 'mukluks,' 'gefilte fish,' and 'Canada. Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini's part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction: [...] "So once that's given, once you know what you think, there's no reason to be ginger about what you <b>say.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> of people, they're very careful not to say things that might offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted. But what they don't realize is that the point of all this is to change the way you live your life, not the way you speak." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stanley is Eddie's next-door neighbor, who {{is obsessed}} with Raven. He serves as the primary {{antagonist}} of the show, he has a frenemy relationship with Eddie and Cory, although he is usually seen scamming them. Stanley was originally brought in as a love interest for Raven's next-door neighbor, Sierra, but he becomes {{much more interested in}} Raven, and in one episode, Loka. Stanley is rude, obnoxious, mean, sarcastic, and deceptive to everyone. He is a young salesman, who usually tricks Cory into buying something that would eventually go wrong. Stanley is always trying desperately to get Raven to like him, but he suddenly leaves her alone after seeing her kiss Andre in the episode [...] "Mr. Perfect". He loves to eat cheese sandwiches. He also competes against Chelsea in a ping-pong match, and loses. In the same episode ("Taken to the Cleaners"), he asks Victor to make him a cheese sandwich {{in the shape of a}} ping-pong paddle. His catchphrases include [...] "My brotha!", which he exclaims whenever he is trying to [...] "show someone up"; and [...] "I may have said that, but I <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things." [...] This is a partial denial of his ability to be nice to other people. He appears primarily in Seasons 3 and 4, in the episodes [...] "Opportunity Shocks"; [...] "Taken to the Cleaners"; [...] "The Grill Next Door"; [...] "Mr. Perfect"; [...] "The Four Aces"; [...] "Driving Miss Lazy"; [...] "Sister Act"; [...] "Checkin' Out"; [...] "Fur Better or Worse" [...] and [...] "When 6021 Met 4267".

He got into the [...] "Up with Goodness" [...] program, feigned an ankle injury, and stole Cory's presentation. It is also noted that he has a fear of bones, which helps Cory prove that Stanley faked the injury and stole his presentation.|$|E
