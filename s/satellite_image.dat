5|$|An unusually small hurricane, with gale-force winds {{extending}} only 60mi (95km) {{from its}} center, Danny {{was prone to}} significant fluctuations in intensity, making forecasts particularly difficult. Indeed, the storm soon underwent an unpredicted period of rapid intensification aided by nearly non-existent upper-level wind shear. Low-level moisture wrapped around the circulation during this phase, mitigating {{the influence of the}} Saharan Air Layer. Danny achieved its peak intensity around 12:00UTC on August21 as a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds were estimated at 125mph (205km/h) alongside a barometric pressure of 960mbar (hPa); 28.35inHg). Shortly thereafter, increasing shear and dry air initiated a rapid weakening phase. The storm's eye became obscured by clouds and disappeared from <b>satellite</b> <b>image</b> late on August21.|$|E
5|$|Around 1200UTC the {{following}} day, Linfa further intensified into a severe tropical storm. A microwave <b>satellite</b> <b>image</b> {{of the storm}} depicted an eye-feature surrounded by deep convection. Interacting with a nearby upper-level low, poleward outflow significantly improved late on June19, fueling further strengthening. Slowly tracking in a general northward direction, Linfa continued to organize and by June20, the JTWC upgraded Linfa to a typhoon. A small, ragged eye appeared on visible satellite images by this time and several hours later, the storm reached its peak intensity just below typhoon-status according to the JMA. Maximum sustained winds peaked at 110km/h (70mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 975hPa (mbar).|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, <b>satellite</b> <b>images</b> {{have been}} used for many {{applications}} intensively. Using of the digital <b>satellite</b> <b>images</b> in relevant approaches may give more accurate ideas about the researched fields.

The temperature of the hotspot has been relatively constant in contrast to Lascar. The presence of lava flows overlying moraines, which indicate post-glacial activity, is controversial; the summit lava flows have been glaciated.|$|E
5|$|During the afternoon, {{satellites}} {{revealed that}} Laura {{had developed a}} deep warm core, a characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but the wind field remained subtropical in nature. By the nighttime hours, the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80mi (130km), much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone. However, Laura was still {{under the influence of}} an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow. However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura {{was on the verge of}} becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September30, but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical. Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor <b>satellite</b> <b>image</b> determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Laura was re-classified as a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude, 40.6°N. Not long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day.|$|E
5|$|In his 2011 book Satellittkrigen, Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation {{journalist}} Bård Wormdal {{argues that}} SvalSat {{is used for}} military intelligence and thus is violating the Svalbard Treaty. Specifically, Wormdal provides evidence that downloaded images of the earth are used for intelligence and military activities. For instance, a Landsat image taken during the Libyan Civil War was sold by the Italian company e-GEOS to the Italian Armed Forces. Similarly, a Technology Experiment <b>Satellite</b> <b>image</b> was sold to the United States Armed Forces during the War in Afghanistan and Arirang-2 images of North Korean installations have been sold to the United States. All three satellites use SvalSat {{as one of their}} ground stations. According to Governor Odd Olsen Ingerø, even if a military should indirectly use information downloaded from SvalSat, this would not be a breach of the treaty. A dissertation by Professor Geir Ulfstein concludes that even if a ground station was directly used for downloading military intelligence from military satellites, it would still be permitted by the treaty.|$|E

5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on June 12. It tracked westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean with minimal convection, and subsequent to moving through the southern Windward Islands it crossed northern Central America. Convection increased on June 20 as the wave entered the southwestern Caribbean. Under the influence of southeasterly flow from developing Hurricane Celia in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the south-southwesterly flow from a mid- to upper-level trough over the Gulf of Mexico, the area of disturbed weather tracked generally north-northwestward through the Caribbean Sea while spreading across Cuba and southern Florida. On June 24, a mid-level circulation developed near the Yucatán Channel, and shortly thereafter <b>satellite</b> <b>image</b> loops indicated deep convection with some cyclonic rotation near the western tip of Cuba. A reconnaissance aircraft flight was dispatched late on June 24 into the system to determine if it developed into a tropical cyclone, though the flight did not observe evidence of a closed low-level circulation. Subsequent to the flight, satellite imagery indicated a low-level circulation was forming, and on June 25 ship and buoy data confirmed the system developed into Tropical Depression One while located about 235miles (375km) west-southwest of Key West, Florida. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center incorrectly classified the system as Tropical Depression Two due to an earlier subtropical storm.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 18hours {{after being}} {{classified}} a depression, deep convection {{wrapped around the}} center of the system, prompting the NHC to upgrade the depression to a tropical storm, and to give it the name Celia. Satellite overpasses of the storm revealed that Celia had already begun developing an eye-like feature at the surface, an indication that rapid intensification may ensue. The storm tracked relatively slowly towards the west-southwest in response to a mid-level ridge to the north. By the evening of June19, Celia displayed a well-organized structure with an eye beginning to appear within the storm's central dense overcast. Due to the presence of easterly wind shear, intensification was briefly stalled for several hours; however, at 1800UTC on June20, the NHC upgraded Celia to a minimal hurricane as it attained winds of 75mph (120km/h). An intermittent eye was seen on visible <b>satellite</b> <b>image</b> throughout the day, but it failed to fully consolidate by the afternoon of June21, by which time the system appeared to be vertically tilted, having the low-level circulation displaced to the northeast of the mid-level circulation. Only modest strengthening took place during this time as the system's outflow was being restricted by continuing easterly shear.|$|E

500|$|The most {{significant}} {{benefit of the}} use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither possible nor routinely available. [...] Intensity estimates of maximum sustained wind are currently within [...] of what aircraft are able to measure half of the time, though the assignment of intensity of systems with strengths between moderate tropical-storm force (...) and weak hurricane- or typhoon-force (...) is the least certain. [...] Its overall precision has not always been true, as refinements in the technique led to intensity changes between 1972 and 1977 of up to [...] [...] The method is internally consistent in that it constrains rapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity. [...] Some tropical cyclones fluctuate in strength more than the 2.5 T numbers per day limit allowed by the rule, which can work to the technique's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the 1980s. [...] Systems with small eyes near the limb, or edge, of a <b>satellite</b> <b>image</b> can be biased too weakly using the technique, which can be resolved through use of polar-orbiting satellite imagery. [...] Subtropical cyclone intensity cannot be determined using Dvorak, which {{led to the development of}} the Hebert-Poteat technique in 1975. [...] Cyclones undergoing extratropical transition, losing their thunderstorm activity, see their intensities underestimated using the Dvorak technique.
