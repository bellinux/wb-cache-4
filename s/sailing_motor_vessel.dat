40|$|Abstract [...] This reseach is to {{evaluate}} {{the strength of the}} traditional ship constructions which focused on phinisi <b>sailing</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vessel</b> in efforts to improve their safety performance. This is because in recent years there has been an increase in traditional ship accident in Indonesian waters. The research was conducted by taking samples of the many ship accidents i. e. 100 GT- 150 GT. The results indicated that theoretically ships sailing in waters conditions under beaufort scale 4, 5, 6, which were generally navigable by traditional ships had adequate strength because their stress still smaller than the requirements on wood. However, in real conditions revealed any discrepancies with the technical requirements such as (i) no watertight bulkhead to separate the cargo hold and engine room; (ii) compaction cargoes which sometimes up to the deck; (iii) weaknesses in wooden construction that built traditionally under the influence of engine vibration. These facts in turn potentially large ship accidents. Indext Term [...] traditional ship, ship strength, ship safety. I...|$|E
50|$|The Bristol Classic Boat Company {{was founded}} in 1999 by company {{director}} Mark Rolt. It builds and restores traditional wooden <b>sailing</b> and <b>motor</b> <b>vessels.</b> The company has rebuilt two Fairey marine Huntsmen motor cruisers and various yachts, in addition to carrying out refits of small craft and canal boats. In 2008 the Pegasus, a traditional designed by Burnett Yacht Design based on the Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter, built for the Island Trust. The company also maintains the boats for the Bristol Ferry Boat Company.|$|R

50|$|The Friedrich was {{initially}} {{used as a}} schooner for the South American hide trade. In 1923 she was registered in Sweden and under the name Merry, and was used for transport in the Baltic and North seas, and for fishing herring {{off the coast of}} Iceland during summer. In 1969, then stripped of her masts and <b>sailing</b> as a <b>motor</b> <b>vessel,</b> she was severely damaged in a fire that all but ended her days on the sea.|$|R
40|$|The ISO 12217 Standards for Small Craft Stability and Buoyancy {{enables the}} {{determination}} of the limiting environmental condition for which an individual boat has been designed. They are prescriptive rules based on a deterministic approach taking into consideration the design parameters assumed significant for the assessment of stability i. e. righting arm curve, effect of inclining arms, position of downflooding openings. In the proposed paper an application case is examined for a 24 m motor yacht built in FRP and suitable for ocean sailing condition. The different parameter evaluations are compared and discussed, also in relation to different loading conditions. Because of the "borderline" dimension of the boat, the stability criteria of the MCA code of Practice for Safety of Large Commercial <b>Sailing</b> & <b>Motor</b> <b>Vessels</b> are also applied and a comparison between the two kinds of requirement is performed...|$|R
50|$|Tantivy {{served in}} the Far East for much of its wartime career, where sit sank a Siamese sailing vessel, the Japanese {{merchant}} cargo ship Shiretoko Maru, the Japanese Communications Vessel No. 137, the Japanese barge No. 136 and the Japanese <b>motor</b> <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel</b> Tachibana Maru No.47, a Japanese tug, two Japanese coasters, a Japanese sailing vessel, the small Japanese vessels Chokyu Maru No.2, Takasago Maru No.3, and Otori Maru, as well as twelve small vessels that are unidentified (all pretty well undefended and peaceable). it also laid numerous mines.|$|R
5|$|Kapitänleutnant Erich von Rohrscheidt assumed {{command of}} UB-42 on 6 April 1918, and six week later, led the U-boat in {{capturing}} the <b>motor</b> <b>sailing</b> <b>vessel</b> Sergij as a prize {{six weeks later}} off Novorossisk. In September, Kapitänleutnant Hans Georg Lübbe (who had succeeded Herbert Nolde after his two-month stint as commander of UB-42) led the U-boat in sinking her final ship. On the night of 7/8 September, the 1,833-ton Italian steamer Vicenza was sent down south of Salonica. UB-42s commanding officer was changed twice more {{before the end of}} the war, but the submarine sank no more ships.|$|R
50|$|Players may {{control a}} variety of <b>sail</b> and <b>motor</b> powered <b>vessels</b> {{above and below the}} sea, {{interacting}} with other vessels, changing weather conditions, marine life and dynamic wave movements. Racing against either AI or online competitors is possible, as is exploring, recreating voyages or naval combat. It is also possible to create and edit both vessel types and marine scenery. Control panels feature compass bearing, wind speed and direction, speed, rpm, fuel level, winch settings, sail settings, radar and GPS are also included. Unusual for a vehicle simulator, users of Virtual Sailor can often roam the interiors of their ships. Weather and sea conditions are adjustable, enabling different levels of play. Vessels may be controlled by keyboard, mouse or customisable game controllers. A large variety of vessel types and scenery have been created by users and are available on fan sites and forums.|$|R
50|$|In 1942, FNS was {{tasked with}} the {{implementation}} of Operation C3, the planned conquest of Malta: according to the plan, 19 transport ships, 270 landing craft and about fifty other vessels, escorted by thirty destroyers and torpedo boats, were to land a total of 62,000 men (as well as 1,600 vehicles and 700 artillery pieces) on the island's coasts. Admiral Tur was to direct the landing operation; in order to implement the landing (35,000 men were scheduled to be landed {{on the first day of}} the invasion, followed by another 25,000 in the following days), FNS was strengthened with MZ-type landing craft, ML-type motor launches, bragozzi, <b>motor</b> <b>sailing</b> <b>vessels</b> and lagoon vaporetti transformed into landing craft, railway ferries converted into landing ships, and several minelayers. In the first half of 1942, FNS, concentrated in Livorno, began training in landing operations along the coast of Tuscany, which had a rocky conformation similar to that of Malta; but in July 1942, due to the rapid Axis advance on the Libyan-Egyptian front, Operation C3 was postponed and then canceled.|$|R
