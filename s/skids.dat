5|$|At around 09:30, {{the four}} CH-46 {{helicopters}} arrived in Ngok Tavak, {{and they were}} able to unload Makowski and about 45 soldiers of the 12th MSF Company. However, the VC demonstrated their domination of the landing zone when the first helicopter was hit with anti-aircraft fire, and was forced to land on the ground, intact, though with damages to the fuel line. Moments later, the third helicopter was struck by a rocket propelled grenade as it turned around to rescue the crews of the first downed helicopter, and it was destroyed immediately. Now, with two downed helicopters blocking the landing zone, the remaining helicopters were prevented from landing on the ground, so the wounded men had to be evacuated while the helicopters were still hovering. As the last helicopter took off, two Nungs and one stranded U.S. soldier grabbed the helicopter <b>skids</b> to get out of Ngok Tavak, but they all fell to their deaths. Shortly after his arrival, Makowski placed the 12th MSF Company under the command of his Australian counterpart, as the situation continued to worsen.|$|E
5|$|Coandă {{described}} a different, more sturdy {{system for the}} attachment of the wings, which also enabled changes in the angle of attack and the centre of gravity. He aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system, and design drawings show the arrangement of two air-cooled rotary engines {{on the sides of}} the fuselage. The placement of the engines indicates that Coandă did not intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it as the cooling of the engines would have been compromised. The patent was annotated with an additional claim on 19 July 1911 which brought significant changes including the addition of retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic fairings with <b>skids,</b> removal of the horizontal stabiliser, a supporting surface was provided for each engine and their accessories were covered to improve aerodynamics. Though Coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms, Antoniu believes that Coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds.|$|E

By using British Pendulum Tester, <b>skid</b> resistance of sidewalk was measured in a wet after snow-melt, sludgy, and snowy conditions. METHODS: The <b>skid</b> resistance was measured on surfaces including Concrete Interlocking Block Paving, Colour Asphalt Pavement, Granite Block Paving, Manhole, and Tactile Paving for Visually Impaired. Five trials at each measurement were made, and the average and standard deviation were derived. RESULTS: The <b>skid</b> resistance measured in wet after snow-melt, sludgy, and snowy conditions for the various surface types are summarized and compared.

5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces.

The new stability control system was improved to anticipate <b>skids</b> and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E

Biodiversitas 15 : 240 - 244. <b>Skidding</b> operation {{has been reported}} {{as one of the}} factor to forest soil degradation and vegetation disturbance. Assessing tree regeneration by the effect of the <b>skid</b> trail from harvest operation is important to determine the recovery rate of the forest stand. A study was conducted to accomplish the following objectives, (i) to measure the tree regeneration rates at different distance from <b>skid</b> trails, and (ii) to evaluate the dominance and species diversity of regenerated trees. A total of five plots with size of 50 m by 2 m were established in two <b>skid</b> trails of natural forest that has been logged in 2012. Each plot contains five sub-plots of 2 m by 2 m in different locations namely <b>skid</b> track, edge and forest. The number of seedlings and saplings, species richness and diversity, and dominance regeneration were analyzed. Results showed that the number of species regeneration was not significantly different in both <b>skid</b> trails. For <b>skid</b> trail 1 the number of seedling and saplings was highest on <b>skid</b> trail tracks (mean species diversity = 0. 45). Meanwhile <b>skid</b> trail 2 showed the greatest species regeneration at edges (mean species diversity = 0. 65). Frequency value for Elateriospermum tapos was high due to the existence of mother tree in the area that provide a great number of seedlings.

5|$|All nine gliders {{carrying}} the troops assigned to Group Steel landed {{next to the}} bridge at Veldwezelt at 05:20, the barbed-wire wrapped around the landing <b>skids</b> of the gliders succeeding in rapidly bringing them to a halt. The glider belonging to Leutnant Altmann had landed {{some distance from the}} bridge, and a second had landed directly in front of a Belgian pillbox, which began engaging both groups of airborne troops with small-arms fire. The non-commissioned officer in charge of the troops from the second glider hurled grenades at the pillbox whilst one of his men laid an explosive charge at the door and detonated it, allowing the bunker to be assaulted and removed as an obstacle. Simultaneously, Altmann gathered his troops and led them along a ditch running parallel to the bridge until two men were able to reach the canal bank and climb onto the girders of the bridge and disconnect the demolition charges placed there by the Belgian garrison. Thus the airborne troops prevented the Belgians from destroying the bridge, though they still faced the rest of the Belgian defenders. The defenders held on until a platoon of German reinforcements arrived and forced them to retire to a nearby village. However, the assaulting force's small-arms fire could not overcome two field-guns located five hundred metres from the bridge, thus forcing Altmann to call for air support. Several Junkers Ju 87 Stukas responded and knocked out the guns. Group Steel was to be relieved by 14:30, but Belgian resistance delayed their arrival in strength until 21:30. During the fighting, the attacking force left eight airborne troops dead and thirty wounded.|$|E

Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by <b>Skids</b> and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well.

The studied treatments included combinations of three different traffic frequencies (3, 7, and 12 passes of a rubber-tired skidder), three levels of slope (20 %) and two <b>skidding</b> directions (uphill and downhill). The impact on soil properties was greatest during the skidder initial passes. On steep slopes, only three skidder passes were required to cause substantial increases in soil bulk density relative to control plots, regardless of <b>skidding</b> direction.
