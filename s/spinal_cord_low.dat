5000|$|Selectivity {{rather than}} {{sensitivity}} {{proved to be}} an Achilles’ heel for some TLC methods with the discovery in 1974-1975 that incubating rat blood cells or brain tissue with (14C-CH3)SAM and NMT as substrate mostly yields tetrahydro-β-carboline derivatives, and negligible amounts of DMT in brain tissue. It is indeed simultaneously realized that the TLC methods used thus far in almost all published studies on INMT and DMT biosynthesis are incapable to resolve DMT from those tetrahydro-β-carbolines. These findings are a blow for all previous claims of evidence of INMT activity and DMT biosynthesis in avian and mammalian brain, including in vivo, as they all relied upon use of the problematic TLC methods: their validity is doubted in replication studies that make use of improved TLC methods, and fail to evidence DMT-producing INMT activity in rat and human brain tissues. Published in 1978, the last study attempting to evidence in vivo INMT activity and DMT production in brain (rat) with TLC methods finds biotransformation of radiolabeled tryptamine into DMT to be real but [...] "insignificant". Capability of the method used in this latter study to resolve DMT from tetrahydro-β-carbolines is questioned later.To localize INMT, a qualitative leap is accomplished with use of modern techniques of molecular biology, and of immunohistochemistry.

40|$|<b>Spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injury (SCI) {{releases}} {{a cascade of}} events {{that leads to the}} onset of an inhibitory milieu for axonal regeneration. Some of these changes result from the presence of repulsive factors that may restrict axonal outgrowth after trauma. The Eph receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family has emerged as a key repellent cue known to be involved in neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and axonal pathfinding during development. Given the nonpermissive environment for axonal regener-ation after SCI, we questioned whether re-expression of one of these molecules occurs during re-generative failure. We examined the expression profile of EphA 3 at the mRNA and protein levels after SCI, using the NYU contusion model. There is a differential distribution of this molecule in the adult <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> and EphA 3 showed an increase in expression after several injury models like optic nerve and brain injury. Standardized semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated a time-dependent change in EphA 3 mRNA levels, without alterations in -actin levels.

40|$|In {{the fatal}} {{neurodegenerative}} disease {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS), motor neurons degenerate with signs of organelle fragmentation, free radical damage, mitochondrial Ca(2 +) overload, impaired axonal transport and accumulation of proteins in intracellular inclusion bodies. Subgroups of motor neurons of the brainstem and the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> expressing <b>low</b> amounts of Ca(2 +) buffering proteins are particularly vulnerable. In ALS, chronic excitotoxicity mediated by Ca(2 +) -permeable AMPA type glutamate receptors seems to initiate a self-perpetuating process of intracellular Ca(2 +) dysregulation with consecutive endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) depletion and mitochondrial Ca(2 +) overload.

40|$|Background: Activation of the {{complement}} {{system has been}} implicated in both acute and chronic states of neurodegeneration. However, a detailed understanding of this complex network of interacting components is still lacking. Methods: Large-scale global expression profiling in a rat F 2 (DAxPVG) intercross identified a strong cis-regulatory influence on the local expression of complement receptor 2 (Cr 2) in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> after ventral root avulsion (VRA). Expression of Cr 2 in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> was studied in a separate cohort of DA and PVG rats at different time-points after VRA, and also following sciatic nerve transection (SNT) in the same strains. Consequently, Cr 2 (-/-) mice and Wt controls were used to further explore the role of Cr 2 in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> following SNT. The in vivo experiments were complemented by astrocyte and microglia cell cultures. Results: Expression of Cr 2 in naive <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> was <b>low</b> but strongly up regulated at 5 - 7 days after both VRA and SNT. Levels of Cr 2 expression, as well as astrocyte activation, was higher in PVG rats than DA rats following both VRA and SNT. Subsequent in vitro studies proposed astrocytes as {{the main source of}} Cr 2 expression. A functional role for Cr 2 is suggested by the finding that transgenic mice lacking Cr 2 displayed increased loss of synaptic nerve terminals following nerve injury. We also detected increased levels of soluble CR 2 (sCR 2) in the cerebrospinal fluid of rats following VRA. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that local expression of Cr 2 in the central nervous system is part of the axotomy reaction and is suggested to modulate subsequent complement mediated effects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We have {{developed}} a highly effective method for in vivo gene silencing in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) by a cationic lipid facilitated delivery of synthetic, small interfering RNA (siRNA). A siRNA to the delta opioid receptor (DOR), or a mismatch RNA, was mixed with the transfection reagent, i-Fect™ (vehicle), and delivered as repeated daily bolus doses (0. 5 μg to 4 μg) via implanted intrathecal catheter to the lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> of rats. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, rats were tested for antinociception by the DOR selective agonist, [D-Ala 2, Glu 4]deltorphin II (DELT), or the mu opioid receptor (MOR) selective agonist, [D-Ala 2, N-Me-Phe 4, Gly-ol 5]enkephalin (DAMGO). Pretreatment with the siRNA, but not the mismatch RNA or vehicle alone, blocked DELT antinociception dose-dependently. The latter was concomitant with {{a reduction in the}} spinal immunoreactivity and receptor density of DOR, and in DOR transcripts in the lumbar DRG and spinal dorsal horn. Neither siRNA nor mismatch RNA pretreatment altered spinal immunoreactivity of MOR or antinociception by spinal DAMGO, and had no effect on the baseline thermal nociceptive threshold. The inhibition of function and expression of DOR by siRNA was reversed by 72 hr after the last RNA injection. The uptake of fluorescence-tagged siRNA was detected in both DRG and <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> The <b>low</b> effective dose of siRNA/i-Fect™ complex reflects an efficient delivery of the siRNA to peripheral and spinal neurons, produced no behavioral signs of toxicity.

The objective of this literature review was to evaluate {{the state of the art}} regarding the evaluations and therapeutic education programs for persons with <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injury. Material and methodSystematic review of the literature with Medline and Cochrane Library databases from 1966 to 2009. ResultsThe main areas of interest, for the evaluations found in the literature, focused on clinical variables, patients’ knowledge, health behaviors, functional independence and quality of life but also psychological dimensions such as health locus of control, representations, abilities to resolve problems and self-perceived efficacy. Ten clinical studies were retained for analysis. These clinical studies were built around various health and educational models.

50|$|Chiari-like {{malformation}} (CM) is {{the most}} common cause of foramen magnum obstruction and syringomyelia in dogs. Syringomyelia (SM) is a disease of the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> typified by fluid filled cavities, or syrinxes, within the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> substance. The disease is caused by the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the nervous system. A situation of high pressure in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> compared to <b>low</b> pressure outside, leads to fluid accumulation, which eventually forms cavities. CM is a condition characterized by the mismatch of size between the brain and the skull. The skull is too small causing part of the brain to descend out of the skull through the opening at its base, crowding the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> The cause of CM is not yet fully understood. CM is rare in most breeds but reportedly has become very widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon). Some researchers estimate that as many as 95% of CKCSs may have CM. It is worldwide in scope and not limited to any country, breeding line, or kennel, and experts report that it is believed to be inherited in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. CM is so widespread in the Cavalier that it may be an inherent part of the CKCS's breed standard. This disease not only affects thousands of dogs, but a similar condition affects over three hundred thousand children yearly. Therefore, canines are an appropriate model for the treatment of the human condition.|$|R

In adult rat cerebral cortical membranes, [3 H]GABA bound to two sites (Kd= 8 nM, Bmax= 0. 62 pmol/mg protein; Kd= 390 nM, Bmax= 3. 9 pmol/mg protein) whereas the GABA agonist, [3 H]muscimol, bound {{only to a}} high affinity site (Kd= 5. 6 nM, Bmax= 1. 9 pmol/mg protein). In adult rat <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> only a <b>low</b> affinity site was seen with [3 H]GABA (Kd= 340 nM, Bmax= 9. 8 pmol/mg protein) and only a high affinity site was seen with [3 H]muscimol (Kd= 5. 6 nM, Bmax= 0. 25 pmol/mg protein). The inability to measure a high affinity [3 H]GABA binding site in <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> probably reflects the high ratio of low to high affinity sites in <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> (39 : 1).

Again, the ratio of low to high affinity sites in cultured mouse <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> neurons was high (27 : 1). The effects of the potent GABA antagonist, (+) bicuculline, on both low and high affinity [3 H]GABA binding {{was determined}}. Bicuculline appeared to inhibit binding to both sites competitively but the Ki for inhibiting the high affinity site was 5 [mu]M and for inhibiting the low affinity site was 115 [mu]M. Bicuculline inhibited [3 H]muscimol binding in both brain and <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> competitively with Kis of 4 [mu]M and 10 [mu]M respectively. Bicuculline inhibition of [3 H]muscimol binding in cultured neuronal membranes {{was similar to that}} in adult rat membranes. The binding of the potent GABA agonist, muscimol, only to the high affinity site in both adult rat and cultured mouse neuronal membranes suggests that the high affinity site is the physiologically relevant postsynaptic GABA receptor. The fact that bicuculline inhibits the high affinity site (but not the low affinity site) in concentrations similar to those needed to block GABA-responses in physiological experiments 28 supports this hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Spinal discs are {{round in}} {{diameter}} and flat {{on the top and}} bottom, and are attached securely to the vertebrae above and below them. The discs are somewhat pliant, providing shock absorption for the spine. The lumbar vertebrae is the largest segments of the movable part of the vertebral column, they are elected L 1 to L 5, an starting at the top. The spinal column, more commonly called the backbone, is made up of primarily vertebrae discs, and the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> The <b>low</b> back pain is one of the significant problems in the industrialized world of ergonomics. Efficient and effective lumbar spinal motion analysis is required to understand low back pain and aid the diagnosis. Common approaches are tedious and time consuming due to the low quality of the images. Acting as a communication conduit for the brain signals are transmitted and received through the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> It otherwise known as vertebral column consists of 24 separate bony vertebrae together with 5 fused vertebrae, it unique interaction between the solid and fluid components that provides the disc strength and flexibility required to bear loading of the lumbar spine. In the work of Segmentation Spine Image using gabor Filter and Canny Edge Detection Algorithm between lumbar spine CT scan spine disc image. The result show that the canny edge detection algorithm produced better result when compared other edge detection algorithm. To detect the correct boundary in a noisy image of spine disc is still a difficult one. To detect the absolute edges from noisy images, the comparison result can be verified and validated with the standard medical values. The final result shows that the canny edge detection algorithm performs well and produced a solution very nearer to the optimal solution...|$|R

40|$|Oral Poster Presentations: Six Best AbstractsIntroduction: <b>Spinal</b> <b>cord</b> {{stimulation}} {{has been}} shown to be effective in the management of peripheral neuropathic pain 1 - 2, although its effects on central neuropathic pain are largely unknown. Materials/Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with monopolar electrodes at the time of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injury (unilateral dorsal quadrant lesion). Dorsal columns at spinal segment T 12 were stimulated 3 days later (earlyspinal cord stimulation), and again at day 7 (late-spinal <b>cord</b> stimulation) using <b>low</b> frequency parameters. Hypersensitivity to cutaneous mechanical stimuli was assessed using von Frey filaments. Lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> were collected after perfusion and cryosectioned for immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against the neural progenitor cell marker nestin and the GABAergic neuron marker, parvalbumin. Results: Behavioural tests showed that early-spinal cord stimulation caused partial reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity caused by <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injury and this reversal was amplified by late-spinal cord stimulation, compared to spinal cord-injured animals without <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> stimulation. Immunochemical assessment revealed that nestin-immunoreactive cells could be identified in the ipsilateral superficial dorsal horn after <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> stimulation in <b>spinal</b> cord-injured rats, ranging over some 600 mm rostral from the lesion with an estimated number of 400 - 500 cells in total. In contrast, nestin-positive cells were rarely observed in superficial dorsal horn of naïve or unstimulated spinal cord-injured rats (with total counts of around 20 cells and 40 cells, respectively). Around 48 % of the nestin-positive cells were co-stained with the GABAergic neuron marker, parvalbumin. Discussion: We firstly found that <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> stimulation can alleviate mechanical allodynia caused by <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injury, and repetitive <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> stimulation provided a long-lasting and incremental anti-hyperalgesic effect. Moreover, our study indicates that the central mechanism of the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> stimulation-induced antinociception after <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injury might be associated with the increased neural progenitor cell as many of them additionally showed some characteristics of GABA neurons. Conclusions: A long-lasting and incremental reversal of hyperalgesia can be achieved, through activation of the spinal neuronal progenitors, by repetitive <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> stimulation in a central neuropathic pain model...|$|R
40|$|The neural {{circuitry}} of the lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> {{can generate}} alternating extension and flexion of the hindlimbs. The hindlimbs of adult cats with complete transection of the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> at a <b>low</b> thoracic level (T 12 -T 13) can perform full weight-supporting locomotion {{on a treadmill}} belt moving at a range of speeds. Some limitations in the locomotor capacity {{can be associated with}} a deficit in the recruitment level of the fast extensors during the stance phase and the flexors during the swing phase of a step cycle. The level of locomotor performance, however, can be enhanced by daily training on a treadmill while emphasizing full weight-support stepping and by providing appropriately timed sensory stimulation, loading, and/or pharmacologic stimulation of the hindlimb neuromuscular apparatus. Furthermore, there appears to be an interactive effect of these interventions. For example, the maximum treadmill speed that a spinal adult cat can attain and maintain is significantly improved with daily full weight-supporting treadmill training, but progressive recruitment of fast extensors becomes apparent only when the hindlimbs are loaded by gently pulling down on the tail during the stepping. Stimulation of the sural nerve at the initiation of the flexion phase of the step cycle can likewise markedly improve the locomotor capability. Administration of clonidine, in particular in combination with an elevated load, resulted in the most distinct and consistent alternating bursts of electromyographic activity during spinal stepping. These data indicate that the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> has the ability to execute alternating activation of the extensor and flexor musculature of the hindlimbs (stepping) and that this ability can be improved by several interventions such as training, sensory stimulation, and use of some pharmacologic agents. Thus, it appears that the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> without supraspinal input, is highly plastic and has the potential to "learn," that is, to acquire and improve its ability to execute full weight-supporting locomotion on a treadmill belt...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Clinical {{monitoring}} of myogenic motor evoked potentials to transcranial stimulation provides rapid evaluation of motor-pathway function during surgical procedures in which <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> ischemia can occur. However, a severe reduction of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> blood flow that remains {{confined to the}} thoracic <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> might render ischemic only the descending axons of the corticospinal pathway. In this situation lower-limb motor evoked potentials could respond relatively late compared with a similar <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> blood flow reduction of the lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> that renders predominantly motoneurons ischemic. Methods: Selective thoracic and lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> ischemia was induced by sequential clamping of segmental arteries during continuous assessment of laser-Doppler <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> blood flow at the thoracic and lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> Myogenic motor evoked potentials were recorded from {{the upper and lower}} limbs. The time to loss of motor evoked potentials was compared (n = 11) during reduction of laser-Doppler <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> blood flow below 25 % of baseline (ischemic segment), and flow was maintained at greater than 75 % of baseline in the nonischemic segment, both during thoracic and lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> ischemia. Results: Average laser-Doppler <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> blood flow in the ischemic segment was similar during thoracic (26 % 15 % [+/- SD]) and lumbar (26 % +/- 16 %) ischemia, whereas normal flow was maintained in the nonischemic segment. The time to motor evoked potentials loss was considerably longer after thoracic <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> ischemia (15 11 minutes) than after lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> ischemia (3 2 minutes, P <. 005). Conclusion: In this experimental model of selective <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> ischemia, a severe reduction of lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> blood flow results in rapid loss of myogenic motor evoked potentials, whereas a similar blood flow reduction in the thoracic <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> results in relatively slow loss of motor evoked potentials. The effectiveness of motor evoked potentials to rapidly assess <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> integrity might be limited when <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> ischemia is confined to the thoracic segment...|$|R
