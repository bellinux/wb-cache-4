They were a {{transition}} between stone and metal bridges, with the roof and sides protecting the wooden structure from weather. The Forksville bridge is a Burr arch truss type, with a load-bearing arch sandwiching multiple vertical king posts, for strength and rigidity. The building of the Forksville bridge was supervised by the 18-year-old Sadler Rogers, who used his hand-carved model of the structure. It served as the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stream <b>gauge</b> from 1908 to 1913 and is still an official Pennsylvania state highway bridge. The United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration uses it as the model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> covered bridge [...] "classic gable roof", and it serves as the logo <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Pennsylvania insurance company.|$|R

500|$|The creek crosses under Trabuco Road and Jeronimo Road; {{the latter}} was once the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stream <b>gauge.</b> It makes <b>a</b> bend to the {{southeast}} then veers back south, entering a large gulch and crossing beneath Interstate 5. The creek then enters a culvert beneath Paseo de Valencia, then crosses under Laguna Hills Drive and cascades under Moulton Parkway, through the community of Laguna Hills. It then swings to the southeast and receives the Aliso Hills Channel, which enters from the left, [...] from the mouth. The Aliso Hills Channel drains much of eastern Laguna Hills, western Mission Viejo, and southeastern Lake Forest. From the confluence, the gradient of the creek flattens sharply and the stream enters a broad and shallow valley that runs between Aliso Creek Road on the west and Alicia Parkway on the east. It passes under California State Route 73, which crosses the valley on an earthfill and a bridge segment. The creek receives from the right the Dairy Fork, [...] from the mouth, which drains parts of southern Laguna Hills and northeastern Aliso Viejo. The southwest-flowing Dairy Fork once flowed in a prominent canyon that was filled in the 1960s and 1970s to build the city of Aliso Viejo; State Route 73 now runs above the former canyon.|$|R
50|$|Continuing {{generally}} {{east and}} running between West Valley Highway {{on the left}} and Route 18 on the right, the river meanders slightly north of east, receiving Mill Creek from the right and Rock Creek from the left before reaching Sheridan at about RM 38 (RK 61). About 1 mi later, it passes under Route 18 for the fifth time and meanders generally east until turning north, still roughly parallel to the highway, at RM 30 (RK 48). About 5 mi later, Deer Creek enters from the left, and 7 mi later, Salt Creek enters from the right. Shortly thereafter, the South Yamhill River passes under Oregon Route 99W and continues northeast toward McMinnville Municipal Airport. In <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> wide meanders starting at about RM 10 (RK 16), the river turns away from the airport and flows under Route 18 for the sixth and last time at RM 5.6 (RK 9.0), the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stream <b>gauge</b> maintained by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The river flows by the east side of McMinnville, where it receives Cozine Creek from the left. It continues generally northeast to join the North Yamhill River to form the Yamhill River, an 11 mi tributary of the Willamette River.|$|R
