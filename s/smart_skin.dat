This work set the foundation for IR detectors on flexible substrates. The group demonstrated the first IR microbolometer array on a polyimide substrate with performance comparable to those on silicon substrates. Based on the success of this IR radiation detector work on flexible substrates, the group expanded to other sensing functionalities like flow, tactile, pressure, force and most recently acceleration. Integration of sensors on conformal substrates necessitated the group to initiate die-level encapsulation for flexible device packaging. Today, the group is focusing on multifunctional, conformal sensor arrays with integrated bias, read-out and power capabilities, the so-called <b>SMART</b> <b>SKIN,</b> for aerospace, defense and medical applications.|$|E

40|$|For the {{effective}} use of troops in a battlefield, it is very desirable that soldiers ’ health be monitored in real time. Health parameters such as heartbeat/pulse rate, body temperature and acoustic waves of lungs provide some vital information about a person’s health. Thus real-time monitoring of health parameters of soldiers will allow someone to assess the current conditions of soldiers’ health. Real-time monitoring of health parameters will also allow someone to determine how rapidly the conditions of insured soldiers are deteriorating. As a result, timely help could be provided to save soldiers’ life. This paper presents an architecture that will use MEMS <b>smart</b> <b>skin</b> technology to fabricate different types of sensors. The <b>smart</b> <b>skin</b> can then be worn underneath the soldier’s uniform to monitor soldier’s health.

The key technologies in morphing aircrafts include adaptive structures, deformable <b>smart</b> <b>skin,</b> driving actuators, flight dynamics and flight control. Among them, the deformable <b>smart</b> <b>skin</b> and light-weight driving actuators have been the main obstacles to the real-world implementation of the morphing aircraft.

The effect of frequency of loading on Stress as a function of Number of Cycles or S-N curve in the presence of temperature variation is not well understood. Effect of elastic-plastic stress-strain field near the crack tip due to stress concentration on fatigue life estimation is still a topic of continued research. The objectives of this thesis are to study these two challenges. Specific objectives are to study (1) effect of frequency of loading on fatigue experimentally in the presence of temperature variation and then evaluate it numerically using existing finite element simulation, (2) effect of elastic-plastic stress-strain field near the crack tip on fatigue experimentally using the <b>smart</b> <b>skin</b> technique developed at Rice University and the evaluate it numerically using finite element simulation with suitable plasticity models, and attempt fatigue life estimation. To achieve these objectives a set of rotating fatigue experiments were performed to study the influence of frequency and temperature on fatigue life. Due to the limitation of the experimental setup tests could not be continued. However, the test results were used to validate the FEM model developed LS-Dyna software. Fatigue life estimation under random loading was studied. The FEM model was used to evaluate the effect of frequency; it was found to have important effect on fatigue life.

Inspired by a quote from J.

The dress mimics the body’s circulation system, the senses and scent glands. The veins and arteries flow freely as the new interactive fabric emitting a selection of scents depending on your mood. It has its own nervous system, which allows the wearer to control the emotional wellbeing of the garment. Using a theory that human biology can be modeled as micro mechanisms - biological functions such as skin, organs and a beat of a pulsating heart can be miniaturised forming the basis of an integrated communication system so that it rivals nature’s own capillaries. Aromatic messages are actively 'pulsed' electronically through a cabling system, to key points of the body in order to activate the smell centre. The <b>Smart</b> Second <b>Skin</b> dress allows the wearer to enter a sixth dimension by creating a rainbow symphony of abstract aromas. This makes us more aware of our own smell sensory universe, which has the capacity to expand our sensory repertoire towards the sixth sense. The wearer could deliver a spray of magic wellness molecules to create their own personal ‘smell bubble’. As a ‘Scentient Beings’ we respond better to our chosen scent, the smell that works with us in our ‘aroma rainbow’. The dress helps you to listen to your body by using the sense of smell. It provides aroma molecules for the right moment for the right effect, triggers new emotions and enhances the intimate contact with other living things. We develop a new hypersensitivity, learn new and stimulating pleasures and recreate lost memories.
