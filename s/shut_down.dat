5|$|As the {{vandalism}} had <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> {{service at}} the central hub, a police squad was organized and dispatched to protect repairmen while they fixed the overhead cables at the main terminal building. The repairmen and the police were quickly surrounded by the strikers who hurled bricks and beat them with clubs. The police and repairmen were forced to flee and were prevented from restoring power to the terminal's lines. By the afternoon of November 1, the strikers were able to force a complete <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> of the urban central hub and halt all city streetcar operations. The <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> also stopped most of Indiana's inter-city light rail transportation, but regional routes outside of Indianapolis continued to operate. The <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> caused widespread disruption of public transportation and its effects were immediately felt by the public.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} HMO and for-profit HMO share on the survival of safety net services and profitable services in hospitals. Using data from 1990 - 2003 and proportional hazard models, I find that hospitals in high HMO markets started out having lower hazard of <b>shutting</b> <b>down</b> services in 1990 - 1994 than those in low HMO markets, but their hazard rates increase over time. By 2000 - 2003, hospitals in high HMO markets ended up with higher risk of <b>shutting</b> <b>down</b> profitable services than those in low HMO markets. Conditional on overall HMO penetration, markets with higher for-profit share of HMOs have higher hazard of <b>shutting</b> <b>down</b> services, and the gap in survival {{between high and low}} for-profit HMO markets is bigger in high HMO areas. Lastly, I find that the hazard rate of <b>shutting</b> <b>down</b> profitable services is comparable among not-for-profit, for-profit, and government hospitals, while the hazard of <b>shutting</b> <b>down</b> safety net services is the highest in for-profit hospitals and lowest in government hospitals. ...|$|R
