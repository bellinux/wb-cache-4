Thus, the aim of this paper is to comparatively evaluate the robustness of multi-modal systems, in serial and parallel fusion modes, under <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks.</b> In particular, we empirically investigate the vulnerability of serial and parallel fusion of face and fingerprint biometrics to real <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks.</b> Our results show that multi-modal systems in both fusion modes are vulnerable to attacks against a single bio-metric trait.

40|$|Several {{studies in}} {{biometrics}} have confirmed {{the existence of}} user-specific score characteristics for genuine and zero-effort impostor score distributions. As an important consequence, biometric users contribute disproportionately to the FRR (false reject rate) and FAR (false accept rate) of the system.

Recent studies indicate the vulnerability of unimodal and multibiometric systems to <b>spoof</b> <b>attacks.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the score characteristics for <b>spoof</b> <b>attacks.</b> Such an analysis will 1) help improve our understanding of the Doddington zoo effect under spoof attacks; and 2) allow us to design biometric classifiers that are more robust to such attacks. The contributions of this paper are as follows: a) examining the existence of user-specific score characteristics for <b>spoof</b> <b>attacks</b> and b) analyzing the correlation between user-specific score characteristics obtained on genuine (as well as zero-effort impostor) and non zero-effort impostor (spoof) score distributions. Experiments conducted on the LivDet 09 spoofed fingerprint database confirms that biometric user-groups exhibit different degrees of vulnerability to <b>spoof</b> <b>attacks</b> as well.

40|$|Multimodal {{biometric}} {{systems are}} commonly {{believed to be}} more robust to <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks</b> than unimodal systems, as they combine information coming from different biometric traits. Recent work has shown that multimodal systems can be misled by an impostor even by spoofing only one biometric trait. This result was obtained under a ‘worst-case’ scenario, by assuming that the distribution of fake scores is identical to that of genuine scores (i. e. the attacker {{is assumed to be}} able to perfectly replicate a genuine biometric trait). This assumption also allows one to evaluate the robustness of score fusion rules against <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks,</b> and to design robust fusion rules, without the need of actually fabricating <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks.</b> However, whether and to what extent the ‘worst-case’ scenario is representative of real <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks</b> is still an open issue. In this study, we address this issue by an experimental investigation carried out on several data sets including real <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks,</b> related to a multimodal verification system based on face and fingerprint biometrics. On the one hand, our results confirm that multimodal systems are vulnerable to attacks against a single biometric trait. On the other hand, they show that the ‘worst-case’ scenario can be too pessimistic. This can lead to two conservative choices, if the ‘worst-case’ assumption is used for designing a robust multimodal system. Therefore developing methods for evaluating the robustness of multimodal systems against <b>spoofing</b> <b>attacks,</b> and for designing robust ones, remain a very relevant open issue...|$|R

5000|$|A GPS <b>spoofing</b> <b>attack</b> {{attempts}} to deceive a GPS receiver by broadcasting incorrect GPS signals, structured {{to resemble a}} set of normal GPS signals, or by rebroadcasting genuine signals captured elsewhere or at a different time. These spoofed signals may be modified {{in such a way}} as to cause the receiver to estimate its position to be somewhere other than where it actually is, or to be located where it is but at a different time, as determined by the attacker. One common form of a GPS <b>spoofing</b> <b>attack,</b> commonly termed a carry-off attack, begins by broadcasting signals synchronized with the genuine signals observed by the target receiver. The power of the counterfeit signals is then gradually increased and drawn away from the genuine signals. It has been suggested that the capture of a Lockheed RQ-170 drone aircraft in northeastern Iran in December, 2011 was the result of such an attack. GPS spoofing attacks had been predicted and discussed in the GPS community previously, but no known example of a malicious <b>spoofing</b> <b>attack</b> has yet been confirmed.
