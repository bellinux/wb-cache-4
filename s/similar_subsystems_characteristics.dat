40|$|AbstractModel organisms provide {{opportunities}} to design research experiments focused on disease-related processes (e. g., using genetically engineered populations that produce phenotypes of interest). For some diseases, {{there may be}} non-obvious model organisms that can help {{in the study of}} underlying disease factors. In this study, an approach is presented that leverages knowledge about human diseases and associated biological interactions networks to identify potential model organisms for a given disease category. The approach starts with the identification of functional and interaction patterns of diseases within genetic pathways. Next, these characteristic patterns are matched to interaction networks of candidate model organisms to identify <b>similar</b> <b>subsystems</b> that have <b>characteristic</b> patterns for diseases of interest. The quality of a candidate model organism is then determined by {{the degree to which the}} identified subsystems match genetic pathways from validated knowledge. The results of this study suggest that non-obvious model organisms may be identified through the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{class of}} {{nonlinear}} large-scale systems with <b>similar</b> <b>subsystems</b> is studied. Both matched and unmatched uncertainties are considered by utilizing their bounding functions, and the interconnections take a more general form than considered previously. Based on a constrained Lyapunov equation, a nonlinear dynamic output feedback decentralized controller is presented. Unlike existing results, matched uncertainties are considered in the control design; by using a decomposition of the interconnections, the known and uncertain interconnections are treated separately; thus, the robustness is improved and conservativeness is reduced significantly. The computation effort for solving the Lyapunov equation is greatly reduced by {{taking into account the}} <b>similar</b> <b>subsystem</b> structure. Finally, simulation is used to illustrate the effectiveness of our results. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a semi-automated framework for identifying and representing {{different kinds of}} variability in Simulink models. Based on the observed variants found in <b>similar</b> <b>subsystem</b> patterns inferred using Simone, a text-based model clone detection tool, we propose a set of variability operators for Simulink models. By applying these operators to six example systems, {{we are able to}} represent the variability in their <b>similar</b> <b>subsystem</b> patterns as a single subsystem template directly in the Simulink environment. The product of our framework is a single consolidated subsystem model capable of expressing the observed variability across all instances of each inferred pattern. The process of pattern inference and variability analysis is largely automated and can be easily applied to other collections of Simulink models. The framework is aimed at providing assistance to engineers to identify, understand, and visualize patterns of subsystems in a large model set. This understanding may help in reducing maintenance effort and bug identification at an early stage of the software development. I...|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} {{is derived}} from the principle that the universe contain as much variety as possible, in the sense of maximizing the distinctiveness of each subsystem. The quantum state of a microscopic system is defined to correspond to an ensemble of subsystems of the universe with identical constituents and similar preparations and environments. A new kind of interaction is posited amongst such <b>similar</b> <b>subsystems</b> which acts to increase their distinctiveness, by extremizing the variety. In the limit of large numbers of <b>similar</b> <b>subsystems</b> this interaction is shown to give rise to Bohm's quantum potential. As a result the probability distribution for the ensemble is governed by the Schroedinger equation. The measurement problem is naturally and simply solved. Microscopic systems appear statistical because they are members of large ensembles of similar systems which interact non-locally. Macroscopic systems are unique, and are not members of any ensembles of similar systems. Consequently their collective coordinates may evolve deterministically. This proposal could be tested by constructing quantum devices from entangled states of a modest number of quits which, by its combinatorial complexity, can be expected to have no natural copies.

The unmatched uncertainties considered may appear {{not only in the}} isolated subsystems but also in the interconnections.

By exploiting the similar structure of the large-scale system, two kinds of discontinuous nonlinear decentralized holographic-structure controllers (DHSCs), which are easily designed compared with general nonlinear controllers, are proposed to asymptotically stabilize the system. It is shown that the analysis and synthesis for nonlinear large-scale systems may be simplified using the similar structure.

In the first application, panel area limitations are overcome by time sharing a central control panel among several subsystems.

Even though its optimization {{has been the subject}} of many studies, an optimization procedure that targets the characteristics of current processor architectures has not been developed.

A judicious combination of analytical and empirical approaches is used to determine the most appropriate optimizations. The absence of problem information until execution time is handled by generating multiple versions of the code- the best version is chosen at runtime, with assistance from minimal-overhead inspectors. The approach highlights aspects of empirical optimization that are important for similar computations with little temporal reuse.

40|$|The baroreflex {{is a key}} {{mechanism}} {{involved in}} the control of arterial pressure (AP) during orthostasis in humans. However, the baroreflex is a closed-loop feedback system, from baroreceptor pressure input to systemic AP, and therefore requires open-loop experiments to identify its system characteristics. The requirement limits our ability to identify baroreflex system characteristics in humans. Open-loop research in animals has revealed dynamic and static characteristics of the two baroreflex subsystems: the neural and peripheral arcs. The neural arc, from baroreceptor pressure input to sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), has high-pass dynamic characteristics, indicating that more rapid change in input AP causes greater response in SNA. In contrast, the peripheral arc, from SNA input to systemic AP, has low-pass characteristics. Orthostasis increases the gain of the neural arc, which compensates for the lower transfer gain of the peripheral arc and in turn maintains total baroreflex function. Here, I discuss the possibility that baroreflex <b>subsystem</b> <b>characteristics</b> identified in animals can be applicable to the human sympathetic response to orthostasis, {{with a focus on}} loading speed-dependence of orthostatic sympathetic activation...|$|R
