40|$|In recent years, {{the higher}} courts in Queensland {{have had the}} {{opportunity}} to revisit the effect <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> on a joint tenancy. The cases allow for the opportunity to examine in more depth the nature of joint tenancy itself, and the concept of alienation as a means <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> <b>of</b> joint tenancy. This article provides an analysis of these decisions to ascertain the contemporary 'state of play' in the law applying to <b>severance</b> <b>of</b> a joint tenancy. A joint tenancy is characterised by the four unities - of possession, interest, title and time! – together with the right of survivorship. Given this characterisation, <b>severance</b> <b>of</b> a joint tenancy represents a fundamental change in the nature of the co-ownership. In particular, the destruction of the right <b>of</b> survivorship through <b>severance</b> will by definition change the potential of each co-owner to hold the whole of the estate in severalty upon the death of the other co-owners. The nature of the common ownership of a joint tenancy, and the potential that it carries, can be adjusted by converting, or severing, the joint tenancy to create a tenancy in common. Unlike a joint tenancy, a tenancy in common is characterised by each tenant holding a distinct interest in the property; the shares may be in different proportions. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{general rule}} is that an action for {{conversion}} lies only with respect to personal property, and cannot apply to real estate.

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{surgical}} approaches for adrenal pheochromocytoma, successful ligation and <b>severance</b> <b>of</b> the adrenal vein at the start can make intraoperative circulatory kinetics stable and subsequent operative procedures very easy. Recently, we adopted a thoracoabdominal approach in 5 cases of pheochromocytoma instead of transabdominal or translumbar approach which {{has so far been}} adopted for such tumors. The results revealed that the thoracoabdominal approach was very advantageous compared with these conventional approaches. Its main advantages include a wide and shallow operative field, early ligation and <b>severance</b> <b>of</b> the adrenal vein before mobilization of the tumor, easy operative procedure and short operation time, etc. The essential point is to carry out an operation not in a torqued flank-position but in a correct flank-position...|$|R

If, under Stack, the parties' beneficial interests fall {{to be treated as}} identical to their legal interests (in effect, giving rise to a joint tenancy both at law and in equity), how does the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> <b>of</b> a joint beneficial tenancy actually operate so as to give rise to separate and unequal shares where the parties' common intention has changed by virtue of post-acquisition events? The question is examined by reference to an ambulatory and new constructive trust, as well as where the parties have entered into an express declaration of trust of their beneficial interests...|$|R
50|$|In Dockwray v Dickinson , it {{was held}} that where the facts {{indicated}} a conversion of a ship and cargo that the plaintiff was entitled to interest in one-sixteenth {{of the value of}} the property. It was noted that one partner could not bring an action in trover against another partner. The plaintiff was not entitled to damages for the whole ship and cargo which was converted, but only the percentage which he owned. This was one-sixteenth. Selling the ship and cargo was a different situation than one where the ship was converted and subsequently destroyed. If a joint owner of a cargo ship sell the ship and cargo with the consent of the other joint owners, there is a <b>severance</b> <b>of</b> tenancy, and upon delivery, a <b>severance</b> <b>of</b> property. The buyer may bring action in trover. If one of the partners forcibly takes the ship, and it is subsequently lost in a storm in the West Indies, it is considered a destruction <b>of</b> the ship. <b>Action</b> in trover can be allowed.|$|R
