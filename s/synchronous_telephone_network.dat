50|$|Telephone network: the <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> connects {{people to}} one another. This network {{can be used}} in a variety of ways. Many {{businesses}} use the <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> to route calls and/or service their customers. Some businesses use a <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> on a greater scale through a private branch exchange. It is a system where a specific business focuses on routing and servicing calls for another business. Majority of the time, the <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> is used around the world for recreational purposes.|$|R
50|$|The term ICT is {{also used}} to refer to the {{convergence}} of audio-visual and <b>telephone</b> <b>networks</b> with computer networks through a single cabling or link system. There are large economic incentives (huge cost savings due to elimination of the <b>telephone</b> <b>network)</b> to merge the <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling, signal distribution and management.|$|R

40|$|Communication networks, both {{data and}} telephone, {{are subject to}} attack by {{malicious}} individuals. One goal of the owners of communication networks is to defend the networks from attackers. For several years, firewalls have been used on data networks to help provide protection from attackers. Until recently, there was no comparable system to use with a <b>telephone</b> <b>network.</b> Several vendors have recognized the need for systems to protect <b>telephone</b> <b>networks</b> and have developed products to improve the security for <b>telephone</b> <b>networks.</b> Sandia evaluated the capabilities of commercial telephone firewall products. Based on {{the evaluation of the}} telephone firewall products, Sandia installed the SecureLogix TeleWall system at both the New Mexico and California sites. Sandia is currently {{in the early stages of}} applying the capabilities of the SecureLogix <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> firewall system to the environment at Sandia. Any site that has invested in computer network security protection through the implementation of firewall and intrusion detection systems should also implement appropriate <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> protection through a telephone firewall system...|$|R

50|$|A {{telephone}} {{numbering plan}} {{is a type of}} numbering scheme used in telecommunication to assign telephone numbers to subscriber telephones or other telephony endpoints. Telephone numbers are the addresses of participants in a <b>telephone</b> <b>network,</b> reachable by a system of destination code routing. Telephone numbering plans are defined in each of administrative regions of the public switched <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> (PSTN) and they are also present in private <b>telephone</b> <b>networks.</b> For public number systems, geographic location plays a role in the sequence of numbers assigned to each telephone subscriber.|$|R

However, there are restrictions. Toll-free numbers are only {{limited to the}} <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> where the toll-free number is being handled. So subscribers of a different <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> company {{will not be able}} to call the toll-free number handled by a different <b>telephone</b> <b>network.</b> International toll-free numbers can only be accessed if the calling party is a subscriber of PLDT.|$|R
