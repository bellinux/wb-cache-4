5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of <b>sufficiency</b> required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Karol Wojtyła, {{archbishop}} of Kraków, was elevated to the papacy as Pope John PaulII — the first Slavic pope ever, {{and the first}} non-Italian pope in 455 years. Also that year, UNESCO approved the first ever sites for its new World Heritage List, including the entire Old Town in inscribing Kraków's Historic Centre Kraków is classified as a global city with the ranking of high <b>sufficiency</b> by GaWC. Cited as one of Europe's most beautiful cities, {{as well as one}} of the most unique destinations in the world, its extensive cultural heritage across the epochs of Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architecture includes the Wawel Cathedral and the Royal Castle on the banks of the Vistula river, the St. Mary's Basilica, Saints Peter and Paul Church and the largest medieval market square in Europe, the Rynek Główny. Kraków is home to Jagiellonian University, one of the oldest universities in the world and traditionally Poland's most reputable institution of higher learning.|$|E
5|$|Margarito, {{traditionally}} {{a sluggish}} starter, anticipated to emerge swift, {{but it was}} Cotto who {{got off to a}} more effective start by throwing numerous punches and applying plenty of movement. Cotto picked up where he left off in the second round, approaching directly at Margarito though easily getting by harm's way once Margarito sought to counterpunch. That, nevertheless, changed approximately a minute into the round, as Margarito landed a right hand that momentarily had Cotto by the ropes. Margarito directed his assault to Cotto's body, but Cotto landed various left hooks. Blood started descending from Cotto's nose, but did not discourage him from closing the round by landing a punch upon Margarito. Mobility represented the key for Cotto in the third round, efficaciously blending boxing and brawling while trying to minimize the blood flow from his nose and a small cut over his left eye. Margarito continued targeting the body, but drew two distinguish warnings for low blows in the span of less than a minute. Margarito closed the gap <b>sufficiency</b> in the fourth round by landing a right uppercut and attacking Cotto's body to slow him down. In the fifth round, Cotto provided plenty of lateral movement which frustrated Margarito. Cotto persisted on the move and would land a flurry of punches prior to directly escaping harm's way. Margarito landed a straight right hand that had Cotto temporarily unsteady with ten seconds to go, but Cotto eluded all of the ensuing punches until the final bell.|$|E
5|$|While Margarito did not land {{a lot of}} punches, he {{remained}} the more engaged fighter in the sixth round. A left hook to the body had Cotto on the defensive early in the seventh round, but {{he was able to}} fend off additional difficulty. A right hand from Cotto slowed Margarito, but he returned with punches that forced Cotto to clinch. Margarito commanded the bulk of the round, throwing 130punches in the round according to Compubox. Cotto was advocated by his corner in between rounds to stay off the ropes. He obliged, providing lateral movement throughout the round but with approximately 30seconds left, Margarito was able to trap Cotto in a corner, but Cotto managed to escape. It was more of the same in the ninth round, with Cotto going back and forth between southpaw and conventional stance. Margarito continued charging ahead, although Cotto would counterpunch <b>sufficiency</b> to avoid Margarito. The same pattern applied as in the previous two rounds, with Margarito charging forward and Cotto using movement while anticipating chances to counterpunch. Margarito immediately concluded the gap in the final 15seconds, landing a left hook, left uppercut and right hand that had Cotto against the ropes. Halfway through the eleventh round, a left uppercut by Margarito left Cotto vulnerable as he took a knee after Margarito landed a right uppercut and two right hands. Cotto managed to get up, but he went down again, despite Margarito not landing another punch. The referee moved in to count, but Evangelista Cotto, Cotto's trainer and uncle, climbed onto the ring apron and threw in the towel. The official time of the stoppage was 2:05of round eleven.|$|E

25|$|A related {{concept is}} that of linear <b>sufficiency,</b> which is weaker than <b>sufficiency</b> but can be applied in some cases {{where there is no}} {{sufficient}} statistic, although it is restricted to linear estimators. The Kolmogorov structure function deals with individual finite data; the related notion there is the algorithmic sufficient statistic.|$|E

25|$|The Humanities Project, {{also known}} as a <b>Sufficiency,</b> is {{designed}} to assess well-roundedness in areas outside of technological knowledge. The project consists of five thematically-related courses in the humanities and arts (such as Western literature, musical composition, etc.), and culminates with a course-long independent project. This can be a variety of different things; recent <b>Sufficiency</b> projects include research into contemporary music history, a student giving a flute recital, original screenplays, and critiques of philosophy. Students interested in foreign languages often skip the project and take an additional course, though there are opportunities to do a project. Students who are majoring in a humanities and arts related field do a similar <b>Sufficiency</b> project in a science or engineering discipline.|$|E

25|$|This theorem {{shows that}} <b>sufficiency</b> (or rather, the {{existence}} of a scalar or vector-valued of bounded dimension sufficient statistic) sharply restricts the possible forms of the distribution.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} <b>sufficiency</b> has {{fallen out of}} favor in {{descriptive}} statistics because of the strong dependence on an assumption of the distributional form (see Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem below), but remains very important in theoretical work.|$|E
25|$|In United States v. Simmons (1877), the Court {{assessed}} the <b>sufficiency</b> of an indictment charging {{the production of}} untaxed alcohol. The Court held that an indictment must either name the defendant or state that the defendant's name is unknown.|$|E

25|$|In general, all evangelicals {{involved}} in the gender debate claim {{to adhere to the}} authority of the Bible. Egalitarians typically argue that the dispute has arisen because of differences in interpretation of specific passages. Nevertheless, Wayne Grudem and other complementarians have accused egalitarians of adopting positions which deny the authority, <b>sufficiency</b> and inerrancy of scripture.|$|E
25|$|Mikhail Gorbachev {{downgraded}} {{the role}} of the military in state ceremonies, including moving military representatives {{to the end of the}} leadership line-up atop Lenin's Mausoleum during the annual Red Square military parade commemorating the October Revolution.

25|$|In general, {{a logical}} {{antecedent}} is a sufficient condition, and a logical consequent {{is a necessary}} condition(or the contingency) in a logical conditional. But logical conditionals accounting only for necessity and <b>sufficiency</b> do not always reflect every day if-then reasoning, {{and for this reason}} they are sometimes known as material conditionals. In contrast, indicative conditionals, sometimes known as non-material conditionals, attempt to describe if-then reasoning involving hypotheticals, fictions, or counterfactuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} has attained <b>sufficiency</b> in {{rice and}} producing {{more than the}} food requirement of its total population. In excess of the palay reserved for consumption, the farmers usually sell their palay to private buyers and the state National Food Authority in the municipality and other neighboring municipalities.

The House of Lords had already tackled fundamental questions such as novelty, inventive step, claim construction and <b>sufficiency</b> during 2004 and 2005.|$|E
25|$|Another {{glimpse of}} Metro-land in the 1970s was {{provided}} by The Good Life, the BBC TV comedy series (1975-8) about suburban self <b>sufficiency.</b> Though set in Surbiton, the programme's location filming {{was carried out in}} Northwood, an area reached by the Metropolitan in 1885. A less benign view of Metro-land was offered in the mid noughties by the detective series, Murder in Suburbia (ITV 2004-6), which, though set in the fictional town of Middleford, was also filmed in Northwood and other parts of North West London.|$|E
25|$|In India, {{which has}} {{historically}} had a primarily agrarian economy, the services sector recently overtook the farm sector {{in terms of}} GDP contribution. However, the agriculture sector still contributes 17-20% of GDP and is the largest employer in the country, with about 60% of Indians dependent on it for employment and livelihood. About 49% of India's land is agricultural; that number rises to 55% if associated wetlands, dryland farming areas, etc., are included. Because {{more than half of}} these farmlands are rain-fed, the monsoon is critical to food <b>sufficiency</b> and quality of life.|$|E
25|$|The LGI {{is one of}} the few {{examples}} of a true command neuron. It passes the necessity and <b>sufficiency</b> principle put forward by Kupfermann and Weiss. Wiersma's initial experiments showed that direct stimulation of the LGI was a sufficient release for the tail flip. In 1981, it was Olson and Krasne who showed that the LGI fulfilled the condition of necessity, because when spikes were inhibited in the LGI through introducing a hyperpolarizing current, no motor activity was produced in response to a stimulus that would have originally elicited the tail flip.|$|E
25|$|The Marshall Court heard thirty-one {{criminal}} cases under the certificate of division procedure authorized by § 6 of the Judiciary Act of 1802. However, the Court had {{held that the}} <b>sufficiency</b> of the evidence could not be certified—whether on a motion {{for a new trial}} or a motion for a directed verdict. In United States v. Briggs (Briggs I) (1847), the Court further limited its jurisdiction to hear criminal certificates of division by holding that the question of whether a demurrer to an indictment should be sustained was to general to be certified.|$|E
25|$|I also do {{not believe}} it would be {{appropriate}} for me to offer opinions, as your letter suggests the committee may seek, about the ultimate responsibility of senior White House officials for the disclosure of Ms. Wilson's identity, or the <b>sufficiency</b> of the remedial measures that White House officials took after the leak. Prosecutors traditionally refrain from commenting outside of the judicial process on the actions of persons not charged with criminal offenses. Such individuals have significant privacy and due process interests that deserve protection as do the intemal deliberations of prosecutors relating to their conduct.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury, and William Dalrymple Maclagan, Archbishop of York, {{answered}} Pope Leo's {{charges in}} their written response, Saepius officio: Answer of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to the bull Apostolicae Curae of H.H. Leo XIII. It was written {{to prove the}} <b>sufficiency</b> of the form and intention used in the Anglican ordinal rites {{since the time of}} the English Reformation. According to this view, the required references to the sacrificial priesthood never existed in many ancient Catholic ordination liturgies and also in certain current Eastern-Rite ordination liturgies that the Roman Catholic Church considered valid.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to address this complication, neurite outgrowths (either axonal or dendritic) in {{response}} to applied compounds have recently been proposed as a more accurate distinction between true neurotoxins and cytotoxins in an in-vitro testing environment. Due to the significant inaccuracies associated with this process, however, it has been slow in gaining widespread support. Additionally, biochemical mechanisms have become more widely used in neurotoxin testing, such that compounds can be screened for <b>sufficiency</b> to induce cell mechanism interference, like the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase capacity of organophosphates (includes DDT and sarin gas). Though methods of determining neurotoxicity still require significant development, the identification of deleterious compounds and toxin exposure symptoms has undergone significant improvement.|$|E
25|$|Tax {{choice is}} {{the theory that}} taxpayers should have more control with how their {{individual}} taxes are allocated. If taxpayers could choose which government organizations received their taxes, opportunity cost decisions would integrate their partial knowledge. For example, a taxpayer who allocated more of his taxes on public education would have less to allocate on public healthcare. Supporters argue that allowing taxpayers to demonstrate their preferences would help ensure that the government succeeds at efficiently producing the public goods that taxpayers truly value. This would end real estate speculation, business cycles, unemployment and distribute wealth much more evenly. Joseph Stiglitz's Henry George Theorem predicts its <b>sufficiency</b> because—as George also noted—public spending raises land value.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} opinion, {{written by}} Justice Anthony Kennedy, {{found that the}} constitutionally guaranteed right of habeas corpus review applies to persons held in Guantanamo and to persons designated as enemy combatants on that territory. If Congress intends to suspend the right, the Court said that an adequate substitute must offer the prisoner a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate he is held pursuant to an erroneous application or interpretation of relevant law, and the reviewing decision-making must have some ability to correct errors, to assess the <b>sufficiency</b> of the government's evidence, and to consider relevant exculpating evidence. The court found that the petitioners had met their burden of establishing that Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 failed to provide an adequate substitute for habeas corpus.|$|E
25|$|Summer warmth {{generally}} {{sets the}} limit to which tree growth can occur, for while timberline conifers are very frost-hardy {{during most of}} the year, they become sensitive to just 1 or 2 degrees of frost in mid-summer. A series of warm summers in the 1940s seems to have permitted the establishment of “significant numbers” of spruce seedlings above the previous treeline in the hills near Fairbanks, Alaska. Survival depends on a <b>sufficiency</b> of new growth to support the tree. The windiness of high-elevation sites is also a potent determinant of the distribution of tree growth. Wind can mechanically damage tree tissues directly, including blasting with wind-borne particles, and may also contribute to the desiccation of foliage, especially of shoots that project above snow cover.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{banned from}} {{politics}} for five years, Thaksin Shinawatra was popular in his former support {{bases in the}} Central, North and North-Eastern Thailand and attempted to maintain {{an active role in}} Thai politics by supporting the People's Power Party, which had become the successor party of the banned TRT. Abhisit promoted populist policies in his party's campaign as the Democrat Party's platform in the 2007 parliamentary election. He claimed that while his platform was categorically considered to be populist, it sought to curb inflation while maintaining fiscal soundness, to apply the village-based microcredit development funds used in the Thaksin-led government but do it as part of promoting royalist <b>sufficiency</b> economy policies in rural areas, and to strengthen the country's long-term competitiveness through universal education through high school.|$|E
