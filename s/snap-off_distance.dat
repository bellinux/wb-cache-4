40|$|With {{the help}} of {{simulations}} based on energy minimization, we have studied the effect of roughness of a rigid contactor with sinusoidal and step patterns on the adhesion-debonding cycle of a soft thin elastic film. The surface instability engendered by attractive forces between the contactor and the film produces a regularly spaced array of columns in the bonding phase. The inter-column spacing is governed largely by periodicity of the contactor pattern. Decreased periodicity of the pattern favors intermittent collapse of columns rather than a continuous peeling of contact zones. An increase in the amplitude of roughness decreases the maximum force required for debonding and increases the <b>snap-off</b> <b>distance.</b> The net effect results in a reduced work for debonding. Introduction of noise and increased step-size in simulations decreases the pull-off force and the <b>snap-off</b> <b>distance,</b> {{as in the case}} of a smooth contactor. Finally the study reveals that a patterned contactor can be used as a potential template in the patterning of soft interfaces...|$|E
40|$|Screen {{printing}} {{has been}} the dominant method of thick film deposition because of its low cost. Many experiments in industry have been done and many models of the printing process have been developed since the 1960 ’s. With a growing need for denser packaging and a drive for higher pin count, screen printing has been refined to yield high resolution prints. However, fine line printing is still considered by industry to be difficult. In order to yield high resolution prints with high first pass yields and manufacturing throughput, the printing process must be controlled stringently. This paper focuses on investigating the effect of manufacturing process parameters on fine line printing {{through the use of}} statistical design of experiments (DOE). The process parameters include print speed, squeegee hardness, squeegee pressure, and <b>snap-off</b> <b>distance.</b> Response variables are mean width and standard deviation of 10 mil, 8 mil, and 5 mil lines in both parallel and perpendicular directions relative to the squeegee travel direction. It is concluded that the squeegee hardness has a statistically significant effect on both directions, while the squeegee speed has an effect only on the parallel direction. The implementation procedures of the experimental design are presented. The analysis of a 2 k factorial design with center points pertaining to the fine line printing experiment is discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Industrial waste {{containing}} colloidal {{particulate matter}} such as coal and mineral processing tailings presents many {{environmental and economic}} challenges. Effective management solutions for these challenges require an improved understanding of colloidal forces between tailings particles which control their flocculation and subsequent dewatering. In this paper, the colloidal and dewatering behaviours of four coal processing tailings were investigated {{in the presence of}} four high molecular weight anionic polyelectrolytes using the AFM (atomic force microscope) colloid probe technique, flocculation and sedimentation testing, and colloid and surface characterisation. Averaged snap-off distances statistically determined from thousands of force curves measured by AFM were obtained by dividing the area between the force curve and the horizontal axis by the maximum adhesion force. This novel assessment of the AFM results showed that for each of the tailing samples and flocculants tested there was statistically a maximum <b>snap-off</b> <b>distance,</b> which on average would correspond to the optimum flocculant concentration. Under this optimum concentration condition the adhesive strength is the strongest to resist potential floc breakage caused by external hydrodynamic forces. Flocculation and sedimentation tests also showed optimum flocculant concentrations for the different tailings samples but these concentrations were much higher than those corresponding to the optimum adhesive strength found with the AFM measurements. This was due to the large surface area of particles in the concentrated suspension used in the settling tests compared with just a few particles used in the atomic force measurement and therefore the two optimum concentrations per unit surface area of particles would be similar...|$|E
40|$|The {{adhesion}} of acidophilic {{bacteria to}} mineral surfaces {{is an important}} phenomenon in bioleaching processes. In this study, functionalized colloidal probes covered by bioleaching bacterial cells (Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans) were developed and used to sense specific adhesion forces to a silica surface and a pyrite surface in various solutions. Experimentally, recorded retraction curves of A. thiooxidans revealed sawtooth features that were in good agreement with the wormlike chain model, while that of L. ferrooxidans exhibited stair-step separation. The magnitudes of adhesion forces and <b>snap-off</b> <b>distances</b> were strongly influenced by the ionic strength and pH. Macroscopic surface properties including hydrophobicity and surface potential for bacterial cells and substrata were measured by a sessile drop method and microelectrophoresis. The ATR-FTIR spectra indicated the presence {{of different types of}} biopolymers on two strains of bacteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{phenomenon}} of debonding in a thin soft elastic film sandwiched between two rigid plates {{as one of the}} plates is brought into intimate contact and then pulled away from contact proximity by application of a normal force. Nonlinear simulations based on minimization of total energy (composed of stabilizing elastic strain energy and destabilizing adhesive interaction energy) are employed to address the problems of contact hysteresis, cavitation, crack morphology, variation of contact area, <b>snap-off</b> <b>distance,</b> pull-off force, work done, and energy loss. Below a critical distance (d_c) upon approach, simulations show the formation of columnar structures and nonrandom, regularly arranged nanocavities at the soft interface at a length scale of ∼ 3 h (h being the thickness of the film). The persistence of such instability upon withdrawal (distance≫d_c) indicates a contact hysteresis, which is caused by an energy barrier that separates the metastable states of the patterned configuration and the global minimum state of the flat film. The energy and the pull-off force are found to be nonequilibrium and nonunique properties depending on the initial contact, defects, noise, etc. Three broad pathways of debonding leading to adhesive failure of the interface, depending on the stiffness of the film, step size of withdrawal, and the imposed noise, are identified: a catastrophic column collapse mode, a peeling mode involving a continuous decrease in the contact area, and a column splitting mode. The first two modes are caused by a very high stress concentration near the cavity edges. These metastable patterned configurations engender pull-off forces that are orders of magnitude smaller than that required to separate two flat surfaces from contact...|$|E
