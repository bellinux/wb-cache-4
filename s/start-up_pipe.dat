50|$|In 2001, Baxter {{teamed with}} schoolmate and Australian {{technology}} entrepreneur Bevan Slattery to launch his second <b>start-up,</b> <b>PIPE</b> Networks. On 30 June 2008 Steve resigned as Chief Technology Officer of PIPE Networks {{and moved to}} California to work with Google as a Technical Program Manager leading a project to deliver high-speed telecommunications systems across North America. Baxter remained a non-executive director of PIPE Networks until it was later sold to TPG in April 2010.|$|E
40|$|Pipe {{designers}} and drafters provide thousands of piping drawings {{used in the}} layout of industrial and other facilities. The layouts must comply with safety codes, government standards, client specifications, budget, and <b>start-up</b> date. <b>Pipe</b> Drafting and Design, Second Edition provides step-by-step instructions to walk pipe {{designers and}} drafters and students in Engineering Design Graphics and Engineering Technology {{through the creation of}} piping arrangement and isometric drawings using symbols for fittings, flanges, valves, and mechanical equipment.

50|$|A pipe may {{experience}} expansion or contraction {{once it is}} subjected to temperatures higher or lower respectively as compared to temperature at which it was assembled. The secondary loads are often cyclic but not always.For example load due to tank settlement is not cyclic. The load due to vessel nozzle movement during operation is cyclic because the displacement is withdrawn during shut-down and resurfaces again after fresh <b>start-up.</b> A <b>pipe</b> subjected to a cycle of hot and cold fluid similarly undergoes cyclic loads and deformation.|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed to simulate the restart behaviour of pipeline containing gelled waxy oil. The model {{takes into account the}} compressible, multi-phase and multi-plug flow characteristics of the gelled oil at <b>start-up.</b> The <b>pipe</b> is initially filled by the gelled oil in the form of plugs separated by pockets of gas. Displacement of the gelled oil is achieved by pumping in another fluid under constant applied pressure. The simulation results obtained show that the initial gas pressure and the location of the gas segment influence the flow of the downstream oil plug, but has little effect on the flow of the upstream oil flow and the clearance time. The length of the gas section has different effects on the oil flow rates and clearance time depending on the initial liquid hold up present in the pipe. The model is robust and insensitive to the specific constitutive model assumed for the gelled oil. It appears to produce a more realistic prediction of the restart flow than other previous models based on restrictive and simplified assumptions. Malcolm R. Davidson, Q. Dzuy Nguyen, and Hans Petter Rønningsen[URL]...|$|R
40|$|A {{one-half}} scale heat-pipe-cooled {{leading edge}} model {{was designed and}} fabricated to verify feasibility and performance of a full-scale Phase B shuttle orbiter design. Model performance was investigated experimentally by radiant heating and aerothermal tests and analytically by using a simple technique which predicts heat <b>pipe</b> <b>start-up</b> from the frozen state and also predicts transient and steady-state thermal behavior. Analytical results agree well with experimental results for start-up and steady-state heat pipe operation. The results indicate that variations in angle of attack and roll orientation had a negligible effect on heat pipe performance. The heat pipes effectively isothermalized the leading edge, and reduced peak temperatures to levels compatible with the use temperatures of superalloys. Results of these tests demonstrated the durability of the heat-pipe-cooled leading edge in withstanding earth-entry thermal and mechanical loads and indicate {{that the use of}} heat pipes in leading edge structures is a reliable concept for fully reusable hypersonic cruise and space transportation systems...|$|R
40|$|Engineers at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) have {{designed}} several heat pipe cooled reactor concepts, ranging in power from 15 kWt to 800 kWt, for both surface power systems and {{nuclear electric propulsion}} systems. The Safe, Affordable Fission Engine (SAFE) is now being developed in a collaborative effort between LANL and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (NASA/MSFC). NASA is responsible for fabrication and testing of non-nuclear, electrically heated modules in the Early Flight Fission Test Facility (EFF-TF) at MSFC. In-core heat pipes must be properly thawed as the reactor power starts. Computational models {{have been developed to}} assess the expected operation of a specific heat <b>pipe</b> design during <b>start-up,</b> steady state operation, and shutdown. While computationally intensive codes provide complete, detailed analyses of heat pipe thaw, a relatively simple. concise routine can also be applied to approximate the response of a heat pipe to changes in the evaporator heat transfer rate during start-up and power transients (e. g., modification of reactor power level) with reasonably accurate results. This paper describes a simplified model of heat <b>pipe</b> <b>start-up</b> that extends previous work and compares the results to experimental measurements for a SAFE- 100 type heat pipe design...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} question of exploitation of near-Earth space environment investigation satellites is {{the support of}} a thermal regime of satellite as a whole and devices in particular. Guarantee of their reliable working in space depends on thermocontrol system (TCS) operation that is confirmed by qualification working-off ground tests both with heat pipes separately and when they are a part of satellite TCS. The program of qualification tests and its realisation is considered in this paper. The typical modelling object is an ammonia aluminium grooved heat pipe (shell diameter of 12 mm, 30 grooves) developed for DLR's BIRD small satellite program. Qualification tests consist of thermal steady-state and non-stationary performance tests, long life tests, environmental tests and others reviewed in the paper. Tests of determination of thermal resistance, maximum heat transfer rate, influence of tilt on maximum heat transfer rate are related to determination of thermal technical characteristics of heat <b>pipes.</b> <b>Start-up</b> tests, in which an ability of heat pipe to continue the function normally after certain power surge is determined, tests on definition of priming time, in which the priming time of heat pipe capillary structure after its full drainage by method of direct discharging and continuing the power supply is defined, are related to non-stationary tests. During the long life tests an ability of heat pipe to function for a long time is checked and quantity of noncondensable gas generated is defined. Test program was realised on test facilities of the National Technical University of Ukraine “Kyiv Polytechnic Institute” (Kyiv, Ukraine) and Institute of Structural Mechanics (Berlin, Germany). The analysis of heat pipe operation during qualification test and flight performance of BIRD satellite is shortly reviewed on the base of telemetric informatio...|$|R
