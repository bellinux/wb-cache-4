40|$|The {{structure}} of mass transport in the stratosphere, {{as well as}} its dynamic behaviors, is explored by imposing idealized sea surface temperature (SST) perturbations in an aqua-planet model. Mass transport within stratosphere is simultaneously running through two processes: the diabatic circulation, also well known as the Brewer-Dobson Circulation (BDC), advecting air mass across isentropic surfaces, and the quasi-horizontal mixing ventilating air mass along isentropic surfaces. It is shown that, with an equatorial SST heating, the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>transport</b> will increase in strength, in a circumstance with both BDC and high-latitude isentropic mixing being accelerated. Behaviors of transport, for both BDC and isentropic mixing, turn out to be with more complexities when the imposed SST perturbation being relocated at different ranges of latitudes or expanding itself with larger longitudinal span.

40|$|In {{the lower}} {{stratosphere}} a significant production of odd nitrogen {{results from the}} reaction N 2 O + O(D- 1) yields 2 NO. Since the transport is relatively slow, odd nitrogen builds up with a maximum mixing ratio of 2 x 10 to the minus 8 th power at 30 Km. Profiles of odd nitrogen, for different latitudes, winter and summer, are computed from one-dimensional transport models. Variations with latitude are small. Horizontal transport is therefore not believed to alter our results significantly. In order to evaluate the effect of odd nitrogen upon the ozone layer, NO(x) profiles are calculated. OH is here a key component, since it converts NO 2 to HNO 3. In the region where ozone is determined by chemistry rather than by transport (above 25 km), NO 2 {{is found to be}} relatively abundant. The effect of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>transport</b> on the NO(x) distribution is shown to depend critically upon the height of emission.

We select {{a suite of}} relatively long-lived tracers, including 7 chemicals (O 3, NO y, PAN, CO, C 3 H 8, CH 3 Cl, and 7 Be) and 1 dynamic tracer (potential temperature).

The model underestimates this contribution by a factor of 2 ? 3, corresponding well to a reduction of 7 Be source by the same magnitude in the default setup of the standard GEOS-Chem model. In contrast, we find that the simulated O 3 contributions from <b>stratospheric</b> <b>transport</b> are in reasonable agreement with those derived from the measurements. However, the springtime increasing trend over North America derived from the measurements are largely underestimated in the model, indicating that the magnitude of simulated stratospheric O 3 source is reasonable but the temporal distribution needs improvement.

The {{decrease}} of {{the concentration of}} ozone de-pleting substances (ODSs) in the stratosphere {{over the past decade}} raises the question to what extent observed changes in stratospheric ozone over this period are consistent with known changes in the chemical composition and possible changes in atmospheric transport.

40|$|Lagrangian {{transport}} schemes {{have proven}} to be useful tools for modelling <b>stratospheric</b> trace gas <b>transport</b> since they are less diffusive than classical Eulerian schemes and therefore especially well suited for maintaining steep tracer gradients. Here, we present the implementation of the full-Lagrangian transport core of the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) into the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry model (EMAC). We performed a 10 -year time-slice simulation to evaluate the coupled model system EMAC/CLaMS. Simulated zonal mean age of air distributions are compared to age of air derived from airborne measurements, showing a good overall representation of the stratospheric circulation. Results from the new Lagrangian transport scheme are compared to tracer distributions calculated with the standard flux-form semi-Lagrangian (FFSL) transport scheme in EMAC. The differences in the resulting tracer distributions are most pronounced in the regions of strong transport barriers. The polar vortices are presented as an example for isolated air masses which are surrounded by a strong transport barrier and simulated trace gas distributions are compared to satellite measurements. The analysis of CFC- 11, N 2 O, CH 4, and age of air in the polar vortex regions shows that the CLaMS Lagrangian transport scheme produces a stronger, more realistic transport barrier {{at the edge of the}} polar vortex than the FFSL transport scheme of EMAC. Differences in simulated age of air range up to 1 year in the Arctic polar vortex in late winter/early spring. The new coupled model system EMAC/CLaMS thus constitutes a suitable tool for future model studies of <b>stratospheric</b> tracer <b>transport...</b>|$|R

40|$|Use of the {{residual}} circulation for <b>stratospheric</b> tracer <b>transport</b> {{has been compared to}} a fully three-dimensional calculation. The wind fields used in this study were obtained from a global, semispectral, primitive equation model, extending from 10 to 100 km in altitude. Comparisons were done with a passive tracer and an ozone-like substance over a two-month period corresponding to a Northern Hemisphere winter. It was found that the use of {{the residual}} circulation can lead to errors in the tracer concentrations of about a factor of 2. The error is made up of two components. One is fluctuating with a period of approximately one month and reflects directly the wave transience that occurs on that time-scale. The second part is increasing steadily over the integration period and results from an overestimate of the vertical transport by the residual circulation. Furthermore, the equatorward and upward mixing that occurs with transport by the three-dimensional circulation at low latitudes is not well reproduced when the residual circulation is used...|$|R
40|$|The fine-scale {{structure}} in lower <b>stratospheric</b> tracer <b>transport</b> {{during the period}} of the two Arctic Airborne Stratospheric Expeditions (January and February 1989; December 1991 to March 1992) is investigated using contour advection with surgery calculations. These calculations show that Rossby wave breaking is an ongoing occurrence during these periods and that air is ejected from the polar vortex in the form of long filamentary structures. There is good qualitative agreement between these filaments and measurements of chemical tracers taken aboard the NASA ER- 2 aircraft. The ejected air generally remains filamentary and is stretched and mixed with midlatitude air as it is wrapped around the vortex. This process transfers vortex air into midlatitudes and also produces a narrow region of fine-scale filaments surrounding the polar vortex. Among other things, this makes it difficult to define a vortex edge. The calculations also show that strong stirring can occur inside as well as outside the vortex...|$|R

40|$|Pole-to-pole {{variability}} of soot aerosol from subsonic aircraft {{is evidence of}} two important aspects of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>transport.</b> Vertical transport to 20 km pressure altitude from flight levels near 10 - 12 km cannot be explained by isentropic mixing. Instead, lofting in the tropics is a possibility. A strong meridional gradient implies that stratospheric soot aerosol residence time is shorter than are mixing times between the hemispheres. Therefore, little if any of exhaust constituents (with residence times {{similar to that of}} aircraft soot aerosol), emitted in heavily traveled flight corridors in northern mid-latitudes by a future supersonic fleet, would be transported to the southern hemisphere. However, a significant fraction of NOx could be lofted to altitudes above flight levels where it would dominate ozone depletion...|$|E
40|$|Model {{simulations}} of column-averaged methane mixing ratios (XCH 4) are extensively used for inverse estimates of methane (CH 4) emissions from atmospheric measurements. Our {{study shows that}} virtually all chemical transport models (CTM) {{used for this purpose}} are affected by stratospheric model-transport errors. We quantify the impact of such model transport errors on the simulation of stratospheric CH 4 concentrations via an a posteriori correction method. This approach compares measurements of the mean age of air with modeled age and expresses the difference in terms of a correction to modeled stratospheric CH 4 mixing ratios. We find age differences up to ~ 3 years yield to a bias in simulated CH 4 of up to 250 parts per billion (ppb). Comparisons between model simulations and ground-based XCH 4 observations from the Total Carbon Column Network (TCCON) reveal that stratospheric model-transport errors cause biases in XCH 4 of ~ 20 ppb in the midlatitudes and ~ 27 ppb in the arctic region. Improved overall as well as seasonal model-observation agreement in XCH 4 suggests that the proposed, age-of-air-based stratospheric correction is reasonable. The latitudinal model bias in XCH 4 is supposed to reduce the accuracy of inverse estimates using satellite-derived XCH 4 data. Therefore, we provide an estimate of the impact of stratospheric model-transport errors in terms of CH 4 flux errors. Using a one-box approximation, we show that average model errors in <b>stratospheric</b> <b>transport</b> correspond to an overestimation of CH 4 emissions by ~ 40 % (~ 7 Tg yr − 1) for the arctic, ~ 5 % (~ 7 Tg yr − 1) for the northern, and ~ 60 % (~ 7 Tg yr − 1) for the southern hemispheric mid-latitude region. We conclude that an improved modeling of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>transport</b> is highly desirable for the joint use with atmospheric XCH 4 observations in atmospheric inversions...|$|E
