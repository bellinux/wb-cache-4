40|$|Full adder is an {{essential}} component for the design and development {{of all types of}} processors like digital signal processors (DSP), microprocessors etc. In most of these systems adder lies in the critical path that affects the overall speed of the system. So enhancing the performance of the 1 -bit full adder cell is a significant goal. In this paper, we proposed two modified level restorers using <b>current</b> <b>sink</b> and <b>current</b> source inverter structures for branch-based logic and pass-transistor (BBL-PT) full adder [1]. In BBL-PT full adder, there lies a drawback i. e. voltage step existence that could be eliminated in the proposed logics by using the <b>current</b> <b>sink</b> inverter and <b>current</b> source inverter structures. The proposed full adders are compared with the two standard and well-known logic styles, i. e. conventional static CMOS logic and Complementary Pass transistor Logic (CPL), demonstrated the good delay performance.

50|$|A {{push-pull}} amplifier {{is a type}} of electronic circuit that uses a pair of active devices that alternately supply current to, or absorb current from, a connected load. Push-pull outputs are present in TTL and CMOS digital logic circuits and in some types of amplifiers, and are usually realized as a complementary pair of transistors, one dissipating or <b>sinking</b> <b>current</b> from the load to ground or a negative power supply, and the other supplying or sourcing current to the load from a positive power supply.|$|R
50|$|To {{understand}} how the inverter operates, {{it is necessary to}} understand the current flow. If the bias current is shunted to ground (low logic level), the transistor turns off and the collector floats (high logic level). If the bias current is not shunted to ground because the input is high-z (high logic level), the bias current flows through the transistor to the emitter, switching on the transistor, and allowing the collector to <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> (low logic level). Because the output of the inverter can <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> but cannot source current, it is safe to connect the outputs of multiple inverters together to form a wired AND gate. When the outputs of two inverters are wired together, the result is a two-input NOR gate because the configuration (NOT A) AND (NOT B) is equivalent to NOT (A OR B) (per De Morgan's Theorem).|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} is {{that more than one}} open-collector output can be connected to a single line. If all outputs attached to the line are in the high-impedance state, the pull-up resistor will hold the wire in a high voltage (logic 1) state. If one or more device outputs are in the logic 0 (ground) state, they will <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> and pull the line voltage toward ground. This wired logic connection has several uses.|$|E
5000|$|More complex {{analysis}} than fan-in and fan-out {{is required}} when two different logic families are interconnected. Fan-out is ultimately {{determined by the}} maximum source and sink currents of an output and the maximum source and sink currents of the connected inputs; the driving device {{must be able to}} supply or sink at its output the sum of the currents needed or provided (depending on whether the output is a logic high or low voltage level) by all of the connected inputs, while maintaining the output voltage specifications. For each logic family, typically a [...] "standard" [...] input is defined by the manufacturer with maximum input currents at each logic level, and the fan-out for an output is computed as the number of these standard inputs that can be driven in the worst case. (Therefore, it is possible that an output can actually drive more inputs than specified by fan-out, even of devices within the same family, if the particular devices being driven sink and/or source less current, as reported on their data sheets, than a [...] "standard" [...] device of that family.) Ultimately, whether a device has the fan-out capability to drive (with guaranteed reliability) a set of inputs is determined by adding up all the input-low (max.) source currents specified on the datasheets of the driven devices, adding up all the input-high (max.) sink currents of those same devices, and comparing those sums to the driving device's guaranteed maximum output-low <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> and output-high source current specifications, respectively. If both totals are within the driving device's limits, then it has the DC fan-out capacity to drive those inputs on those devices as a group, and otherwise it doesn't, regardless of the manufacturer's given fan-out number. However, for any reputable manufacturer, if this current analysis reveals that the device cannot drive the inputs, the fan-out number will agree.|$|E

(the optimal currents of Isaacson). If one constrains the total current (L 1 norm) the optimal patterns are pair drives.

40|$|The PCA 9551 LED blinker blinks LEDs in I 2 C-bus and SMBus {{applications}} {{where it}} is necessary to limit bus traffic or free up the I 2 C-bus master's (MCU, MPU, DSP, chip set, etc.) timer. The uniqueness of this device is the internal oscillator with two programmable blink rates. To blink LEDs using normal I/O expanders like the PCF 8574 or PCA 9554, the bus master must send repeated commands to turn the LED on and off. This greatly increases the amount of traffic on the I 2 C-bus and uses up one of the master's timers. The PCA 9551 LED blinker instead requires only the initial set-up command to program BLINK RATE 1 and BLINK RATE 2 (i. e., the frequency and duty cycle) for each individual output. From then on, only one command from the bus master is required to turn each individual open-drain output on, off, or to cycle at BLINK RATE 1 or BLINK RATE 2. Maximum output <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> is 25 mA per bit and 100 mA per package. Any bits not used for controlling the LEDs can be used for General Purpose parallel Input/Output (GPIO) expansion. The active LOW hardware reset pin (RESET) and Power-On Reset (POR) initializes the registers to their default state, all zeroes, causing the bits to be set HIGH (LED off).

40|$|Abstract Background Although the {{mechanisms}} of short- and long-term potentiation of nociceptive-evoked responses are {{well known in the}} spinal cord, including central sensitization, there has been a growing body of information on such events in the cerebral cortex. In view of the importance of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in chronic pain conditions, this review considers neuronal plasticities in the thalamocingulate pathway that may be the earliest changes associated with such syndromes. Results A single nociceptive electrical stimulus to the sciatic nerve induced a prominent <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> in the layer II/III of the ACC in vivo, while high frequency stimulation potentiated the response of this current. Paired-pulse facilitation by electrical stimulation of midline, mediodorsal and intralaminar thalamic nuclei (MITN) suggesting that the MITN projection to ACC mediates the nociceptive short-term plasticity. The short-term synaptic plasticities were evaluated for different inputs in vitro where the medial thalamic and contralateral corpus callosum afferents were compared. Stimulation of the mediodorsal afferent evoked a stronger short-term synaptic plasticity and effectively transferred the bursting thalamic activity to cingulate cortex that was not true for contralateral stimulation. This short-term enhancement of synaptic transmission was mediated by polysynaptic pathways and NMDA receptors. Layer II/III neurons of the ACC express a short-term plasticity that involves glutamate and presynaptic calcium influx and is an important mechanism of the short-term plasticity. Conclusion The potentiation of ACC neuronal activity induced by thalamic bursting suggest that short-term synaptic plasticities enable the processing of nociceptive information from the medial thalamus and this temporal response variability is particularly important in pain because temporal maintenance of the response supports cortical integration and memory formation related to noxious events. Moreover, these modifications of cingulate synapses appear to regulate afferent signals that may be important to the transition from acute to chronic pain conditions associated with persistent peripheral noxious stimulation. Enhanced and maintained nociceptive activities in cingulate cortex, therefore, can become adverse and it will be important to learn how to regulate such changes in thalamic firing patterns that transmit nociceptive information to ACC in early stages of chronic pain. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the design of {{portable}} electronic devices must incorporate thermal analyses to ensure the device can be adequately cooled to acceptable temperatures. Consumer demand for smaller, more powerful devices has {{lead to an increase}} in the heat required to be dissipated and a reduction in the surface area both of which result in an increased heat flux. In this paper, an experimental study is performed on one of the smallest commercially available miniature fans, suitable for cooling portable electronic devices, used in conjunction with both finned and finless heat sinks. Previous analysis has shown that due to fan exit angle, flow does not enter the heat sinks parallel to the fins or bounding walls. This results in a non uniform flow rate within the channels of the finned and finless heat sink along with impingement of the flow at the entrance giving rise to large entrance pressure losses. In this paper straightening diffusers were attached at the exit of the fan which resulted in aligning the flow entering the heat sinks with the fins and channel walls. In designing the finned heat <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> optimization criterion for finned heat exchangers has been applied to ensure maximum heat transfer rates; the finless heat sink was designed to the same specifications. The maximum overall footprint area of the cooling solution is 534 mm 2 with a profile height of 5 mm. The thermal performance of each cooling solution was investigated by quantifying its thermal resistance over a range of fan speeds and comparing the results to cases without diffusers. In order to investigate the flow field, detailed velocity measurements were obtained using Particle Image Velocimetry, which provided a further insight into the physics of the flow in such miniature geometries and in designing the straightening diffusers. The thermal analysis results indicate that the cooling power of the solution is increased by up to 20 % through the introduction of a diffuser. Hence, demonstrating the need for integrated fan and heat sink design of low profile applications. © 2008 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} how PLL frequency synthesizers with cascaded and nested loop topologies {{can be used}} for the synthesis of low noise high frequency signals. Briefly explained, synthesizers with cascaded/nested loops combine a broadband PLL and a narrowband PLL. The broadband PLL makes it possible to obtain a low phase noise even from a relatively noisy VCO with an integrated resonator. The narrowband PLL, on the other hand, makes it possible to tune the output signal with a high frequency resolution. A necessary building block of this kind of synthesizer is a low frequency VCO having low noise. The thesis {{describes how}} this kind of VCO can be implemented by the use of low loss external resonator components and by employing tank enhancement for additional noise suppression. Tank enhancement is obtained by the use of centre tapped capacitors {{in order to reduce the}} tank impedance. A consequence of tank enhancement is that the transconductance of the gain element must be increased. The thesis also describes the design and evaluation of two fully integrated VCOs implemented in 0. 35 µm CMOS. One of the VCOs had an operating freqency around 5. 8 GHz. This VCO was also used as a building block of an experimental broadband PLL synthesizer having a target loop bandwidth of 25 MHz. Due to the large variations in VCO gain as a function of frequency, the PLL had a very narrow locking range. The other VCO had an operating frequency around 2. 4 GHz and was designed with multiple parallel tuning elements. This configuration could be used to reduce the magnitude of the VCO gain by about 34 dB and to make the VCO less sensitive to noise from the charge pump or loop filter, while still maintaining a wide frequency tuning range. Another benefit of multiple tuning inputs would be that the variations in feedback tuning voltage could be reduced. This would reduce the variations in VCO gain and the mismatch between the source current and <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> of the charge pump and give a reduction of the reference spur level. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
