40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>shaming</b> penalties. It establishes {{that there may be}} an inverse relation between the rate of <b>shaming</b> penalties and their deterrent effects - the more people are <b>shamed</b> the less deterring <b>shaming</b> penalties become. This conclusion is based on a search model in which the costs of searching for law-abiding partners increase with the rate of <b>shaming,</b> and may lead to lower expected sanction for offenders. The inverse relation between the rate of <b>shaming</b> penalties and their effectiveness is later used to show that increasing the probability of detection, increasing the magnitude of <b>shaming</b> penalties or reducing the number of wrongful acquittals does not necessarily increase the deterrent effects of <b>shaming</b> penalties (and may, in fact, decrease these effects). ...|$|R
40|$|We address individual-level {{hypotheses}} from Braithwaite’s <b>shaming</b> theory using Russian survey data. The {{results are}} mixed. Disintegrative <b>shaming</b> {{is associated with}} future misconduct, but being reintegratively <b>shamed</b> is also positively predictive of projected crime/deviance while participating in gossip is unrelated to future deviance. Interdependency {{does not seem to}} enhance the effects of <b>shaming</b> variables. In addition, guilt and fear of losing respect from others for potential misbehavior {{do not seem to be}} related to past <b>shaming</b> experiences nor do they mediate supposed relationships between past <b>shaming</b> experiences and misconduct. These results, in conjunction with the collective body of evidence already compiled, suggest that the theory may need further refinement.

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of Sociology, Anthropology, and Social WorkMichelle BemillerJohn Braithwaite {{developed}} {{the theory of}} reintegrative <b>shaming</b> in 1989. His hope {{was to develop a}} theory that better explained the complexities of crime such as the age curve, and high number of male offenders. Building from Braithwaite’s work, this thesis utilizes Reintegrative <b>Shaming</b> theory to explore how attitudes influence the reintegrative <b>shaming</b> process, and whether or not women, are more susceptible to <b>shaming</b> than men, as hypothesized by Braithwaite. It seeks to understand the role attitude plays in the reintegrative <b>shaming</b> process. This thesis hypothesizes that a reintegrative <b>shaming</b> punishment will positively impact an offender’s attitudes towards law, deterrence, law enforcement officials, and so on. Further, Braithwaite hypothesized that interdependent and communitarian individuals will be more susceptible to the impact of punishment (shaming); this relationship is also tested. Using data from the Reintegrative <b>Shaming</b> Experiments (RISE) in Australia, this thesis specifically studies the impact of sex and <b>shaming</b> punishment on attitudes towards the law and deterrence attitudes. In addition, information from RISE is used to test the relationships between interdependency and sex, and communitarianism and sex. The findings suggest mixed support for Reintegrative <b>Shaming</b> theory...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{technological}} communication {{have dramatically}} changed {{the ways in}} which social norm enforcement is used to constrain behavior. Nowhere is this more powerfully demonstrated than through current events around online <b>shaming</b> and cyber harassment. Low cost, anonymous, instant, and ubiquitous access to the Internet has removed most—if not all—of the natural checks on <b>shaming.</b> The result is norm enforcement that is indeterminate, uncalibrated, and often tips into behavior punishable in its own right—thus generating a debate over whether the state should intervene to curb online <b>shaming</b> and cyber harassment. A few years before this change in technology, a group of legal scholars debated just the opposite, discussing the value of harnessing the power of social norm enforcement through <b>shaming</b> by using state <b>shaming</b> sanctions as a more efficient means of criminal punishment. Though the idea was discarded, many of their concerns were prescient and can inform today’s inverted new inquiry: whether the state should create limits on <b>shaming</b> and cyber bullying. Perhaps more importantly, the debate reintroduces the notion of thinking of <b>shaming</b> within the framework of social norm enforcement, thus clarifying the taxonomy of online <b>shaming,</b> cyber bullying, and cyber harassment. This Article ties together the current conversation around online <b>shaming,</b> cyber bullying, and cyber harassment with the larger legal discussion on social norms and <b>shaming</b> sanctions. It argues that the introduction of the Internet has altered the social conditions in which people speak and thus changed the way we perceive and enforce social norms. Accordingly, online <b>shaming</b> is (1) an over-determined punishment with indeterminate social meaning; (2) not a calibrated or measured form of punishment; and (3) of little or questionable accuracy in who and what it punishes...|$|R

50|$|So You've Been Publicly <b>Shamed</b> (2015) {{is a book}} by British {{journalist}} Jon Ronson about online <b>shaming</b> and {{its historical}} antecedents. The book explores the re-emergence of public <b>shaming</b> as an Internet phenomenon, particularly on Twitter. As a state-sanctioned punishment, public <b>shaming</b> was popular in Colonial America. Between 1837 in the UK and 1839 in the US, it was phased out as a punishment, not due to the increasingly populous society, as was widely held, but instead in response to rising calls for compassion.|$|R
40|$|Criminological {{research}} suggests that informal sanctions like <b>shaming</b> may have a stronger influence on crime than do formal sanctions, but research has yet to examine whether anticipated <b>shaming</b> may mediate the relationship between crime and variables derived from dominant micro-level theories. The present paper argues that variables derived from learning, control, strain, and deterrence theories influence criminal offending via their effect on anticipated <b>shaming.</b> Using data collected from a sample of young adults, results from both tobit and path analyses suggest that the prospect of <b>shaming</b> among friends and family bears a stronger direct relation to criminal intent than do more commonly examined variables and {{that the effect of}} such variables on criminal intent is largely indirect, mediated by anticipated <b>shaming.</b> We therefore suggest that crime control efforts might benefit from incorporating a greater role for Braithwaite 2 ̆ 7 s conception of reintegrative <b>shaming...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{advances}} privacy theory through {{examination of}} online <b>shaming,</b> focusing in particular on persecution by internet mobs. While <b>shaming</b> is nothing new, the technology used for modern <b>shaming</b> {{is new and}} evolving, making it a revealing lens through which to analyze points of analytical friction within and between traditional conceptions of privacy. To that end, this paper first explores the narrative and structure of online <b>shaming,</b> identifying broad categories of <b>shaming</b> of vigilantism, bullying, bigotry and gossiping, which are then used throughout the paper to evaluate different angles to the privacy problems raised. Second, this paper examines <b>shaming</b> through three dominant debates concerning privacy—privacy’s link with dignity, {{the right to privacy}} in public places and the social dimension of privacy. Certain themes emerged from this analysis. A common feature of online <b>shaming</b> is public humiliation. A challenge is to differentiate between a humbling (rightly knocking someone down a peg for a social transgression) and a humiliation that is an affront to dignity (wrongly knocking someone down a peg). In addition, the privacy concern of <b>shamed</b> individuals is not necessarily about intrusion on seclusion or revelation of embarrassing information, but rather about the disruption in their ability to continue to participate in online spaces free from attack. The privacy interest therefore becomes more about enabling participation in social spaces, enabling connections and relationships to form, and about enabling identity-making. Public humiliation through <b>shaming</b> can disrupt all of these inviting closer scrutiny concerning how law can be used as an enabling rather than secluding tool...|$|R
40|$|The dust has settled, and the 2001 - 2002 {{corporate}} scandals {{are in the}} rearview mirror for most executives and managers.
