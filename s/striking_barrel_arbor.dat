50|$|The {{principle}} of any power reserve device {{is that when}} the mainspring is wound either automatically or manually, a special train of gears connected to the ratchet wheel or the <b>barrel</b> <b>arbor</b> drives the power reserve indication showing the extent of the wind. The barrel’s teeth are also connected {{to the other side of}} this differential train so that as the mainspring's power is used, the power reserve indication moves in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prominent}} role of SCD was rescuing civilians from <b>strikes</b> with <b>barrel</b> bombs, {{improvised explosive devices}} dropped from by SAAF helicopters. Following the intervention of Russia in Syria on September 30, 2015, {{much of the work}} of SCD has been responding to attacks by Russian Air Force attack aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} jewels used in watch {{movements}} {{increased over the}} last 150 years as jeweling grew less expensive and watches grew more accurate. The only bearings that {{really need to be}} jeweled in a watch are the ones in the going train - the gear train that transmits force from the mainspring barrel to the balance wheel - since only they are constantly under force from the mainspring. The wheels that turn the hands (the motion work) and the calendar wheels are not under load, while the ones that wind the mainspring (the keyless work) are used very seldom, so they do not wear significantly. Friction has the greatest effect in the wheels that move the fastest, so they benefit most from jewelling. So the first mechanism to be jeweled in watches was the balance wheel pivots, followed by the escapement. As more jeweled bearings were added, they were applied to slower moving wheels, and jewelling progressed up the going train toward the barrel. A 17 jewel watch has every bearing from the balance wheel to the center wheel pivot bearings jeweled, so it was considered a 'fully jeweled' watch. In quality watches, to minimize positional error, capstones were added to the lever and escape wheel bearings, making 21 jewels. Even the mainspring <b>barrel</b> <b>arbor</b> was sometimes jeweled, making the total 23. When self-winding watches were introduced in the 1950s, several wheels in the automatic winding mechanism were jeweled, increasing the count to 25-27.|$|R
5|$|The Ravens were {{volunteer}} Air Force {{officers who}} already had 500 flying hours (six months) as FACs in South Vietnam and who would serve six-month tours in Laos. There were {{always going to be}} shortages of both personnel and aircraft in the new program. Only six Ravens were assigned between 1966 and 1968 to control the ever-expanding amounts of U.S. airpower being utilized in Laos. Even {{at the height of the}} program, when they would control one-third to two-thirds of the tactical air <b>strikes</b> in the <b>Barrel</b> Roll area, there were never more than 22 Ravens.|$|R
5|$|The communists {{were not}} through with Phou Pha Thi.

On 11 March, Lima Site 85 was struck by an attack spearheaded by the sappers of the 41st Dac Cong Battalion {{and supported by the}} 923rd PAVN Infantry Battalion and the site was quickly overrun. Five of the Air Force technicians manning the site managed to escape, but 11 more were never heard from again and were carried as missing in action.|$|R

40|$|The rat primary {{somatosensory}} cortex (S 1) is remarkable for its conspicuous vertical compartmentalization in barrels and septal columns, which are additionally stratified in horizontal layers. Whereas excitatory neurons {{from each of}} these compartments perform different types of processing, the role of interneurons is much less clear. Among the numerous types of GABAergic interneurons, those producing nitric oxide (NO) are especially puzzling, since this gaseous messenger can modulate neural activity, synaptic plasticity and neurovascular coupling. We used a quantitative morphological approach to investigate whether nitrergic interneurons, which might therefore be considered both as NO volume diffusers and as elements of local circuitry, display features that could relate to barrel cortex architecture. In fixed brain sections, nitrergic interneurons can be revealed by histochemical processing for NADPH-diaphorase (NADPHd). Here, the dendritic arbors of nitrergic neurons from different compartments of area S 1 were 3 D reconstructed from serial 200 -μm thick sections, using 100 x objective and the Neurolucida system. Standard morphological parameters were extracted for all individual arbors and compared across columns and layers. Wedge {{analysis was used to}} compute dendritic orientation indices. Supragranular layers displayed the highest density of nitrergic neurons, whereas layer IV contained nitrergic neurons with largest soma area. The highest nitrergic neuronal density was found in septa, where dendrites were previously characterized as more extense and ramified than in <b>barrels.</b> Dendritic <b>arbors</b> were not confined to the boundaries of the column nor layer of their respective soma, being mostly double-tufted and vertically oriented, except in supragranular layers. These data strongly suggest that nitrergic interneurons adapt their morphology to the dynamics of processing performed by cortical compartments...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most popular}} {{cultural}} {{activity in the}} town is called the [...] "Kufenstechen", which is a customary church parish festival among the Alpine farming community. This annual event, held on Whit Monday, is celebrated {{in the month of}} May and marks the participation of unmarried men riding bareback on Noriker horses, wearing traditional costumes. The event involves horse riders <b>striking</b> a wooden <b>barrel</b> with an iron club till the last wooden splinter is felled; this involves several rounds of horse riding around the barrel till it is broken fully. The winner is given a flower wreath, which he wears on his wrist. This festival is said to be observed since 1630 AD. After the horse ride, a traditional dance festival is held under a lime tree (called the [...] "Linde Dance") with the winner of the horse event getting the first dance. Unmarried girls participate in the dance dressed in traditional [...] "Gailtaler" [...] costumes. The dance is accompanied by traditional songs, some in Slovenian.|$|R
