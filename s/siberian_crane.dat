5000|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>crane</b> was {{formally}} described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1773 {{and given the}} binomial name Grus leucogeranus. The specific epithet {{is derived from the}} classical Greek words leukos for [...] "white" [...] and geranos [...] for a [...] "crane". Ustad Mansur, a 17th-century court artist and singer of Jahangir, had illustrated a <b>Siberian</b> <b>crane</b> about 100 years earlier. The genus Megalornis was used for the cranes by George Robert Gray and this species was included in it, while Richard Bowdler Sharpe suggested a separation from Grus and used the genus Sarcogeranus. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>crane</b> lacks the complex tracheal coils found in most other cranes but shares this feature with the wattled crane. The unison call differed from that of most cranes and some authors suggested that the <b>Siberian</b> <b>crane</b> belonged in the genus Bugeranus along with the wattled crane. Comparisons of the DNA sequences of cytochrome-b however suggest that the <b>Siberian</b> <b>crane</b> is basal among the Gruinae and the wattled crane is retained as the sole species in the genus Bugeranus and placed as a sister to the Anthropoides cranes.|$|E
40|$|Populations of Lesser Sandhill Crane (Grus canadensis canadensis) {{have been}} {{increasing}} {{during the last}} decades in Eastern Siberia, an area historically known as breeding grounds of endangered <b>Siberian</b> <b>Cranes</b> (G. leucogeranus). Significant overlap in niche dimensions between the two species may occur and could lead to competition between them. Therefore, this study of comparative breeding ecology of common Lesser Sandhill <b>Cranes</b> and endangered <b>Siberian</b> <b>Cranes</b> was performed. From late May to early August 2000, I studied Lesser Sandhill and <b>Siberian</b> <b>cranes</b> within a 30, 000 -ha part of Kytalyk Resource Reserve in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Russia. My main objective was to compare dispersion patterns and resource use of breeding Lesser Sandhill and <b>Siberian</b> <b>cranes</b> in areas of distribution overlap. Lesser Sandhill Cranes used moderate-wet (polygon) areas as their nest sites and main foraging areas, where terrestrial foods were scattered. In contrast, <b>Siberian</b> <b>Cranes</b> were nesting and foraging on low-basin wet areas, where aquatic foods were concentrated and dominant. Inter-nest distances were less for heterospecific cranes than for conspecific cranes, and more territorial behavior was projected toward conspecifics than toward heterospecifics. Lesser Sandhill Cranes were more mobile and used moderate-wet (polygon) areas more than Siberian Cranes; however, both species spent similar time foraging and being alert. The two crane species used different vegetation types for nesting and foraging, had different time-activity budgets, and used different resources in the Siberian tundra. While the population of Lesser Sandhill Cranes {{in the study area}} has the potential to increase, both species may simultaneously share the same geographic area due to differences in ecological requirements...|$|R
