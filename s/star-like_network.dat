For low linking costs networks with all nodes in symmetric positions are a best response of the designer under both link deletion and node deletion. For high linking costs the designer builds a star network under link deletion, but for node deletion excludes some nodes from the network to build a smaller but stronger network. For intermediate linking costs the designer again builds a symmetric network under node deletion but a <b>star-like</b> <b>network</b> with weak spots under link deletion...|$|E

We analyze <b>star-like</b> <b>networks</b> of Henon maps. They are found to demonstrate a huge diversity of regimes. Varying the coupling strength we reveal chaos, quasiperiodicity, and periodicity. The nodes can be both fully- and phase-synchronized. The hub node can be either synchronized with the subordinate nodes or oscillate separately from fully synchronized subordinates. There is a range of wild multistability where the zoo of regimes is the most various. One can hardly predict here even a qualitative nature of the expected solution, since each perturbation of the coupling strength or initial conditions results in a new character of dynamics.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the sensitivity of}} epidemic behavior to a bounded susceptibility constraint [...] susceptible nodes are infected by their neighbors via the regular SI/SIS dynamics, but subject to a cap on the infection rate. Such a constraint is motivated by modern social networks, wherein messages are broadcast to all neighbors, but attention spans are limited. Bounded susceptibility also arises in distributed computing applications with download bandwidth constraints, and in human epidemics under quarantine policies. Network epidemics have been extensively studied in literature; prior work characterizes the graph structures required to ensure fast spreading under the SI dynamics, and long lifetime under the SIS dynamics. In particular, these conditions {{turn out to be}} meaningful for two classes of networks of practical relevance [...] dense, uniform (i. e., clique-like) graphs, and sparse, structured (i. e., star-like) graphs. We show that bounded susceptibility has a surprising impact on epidemic behavior in these graph families. For the SI dynamics, bounded susceptibility has no effect on <b>star-like</b> <b>networks,</b> but dramatically alters the spreading time in clique-like networks. In contrast, for the SIS dynamics, clique-like networks are unaffected, but <b>star-like</b> <b>networks</b> exhibit a sharp change in extinction times under bounded susceptibility. Our findings are useful for the design of disease-resistant networks and infrastructure networks. More generally, they show that results for existing epidemic models are sensitive to modeling assumptions in non-intuitive ways, and suggest caution in directly using these as guidelines for real systems...|$|R

By the strong disorder renormalization group method, the scaling dimension $x_M$ of the local order parameter at the junction is calculated.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{a model of}} content contribution in peer-to-peer networks with linear quadratic payoffs and very general interaction patterns. We find that Nash equilibria of this game always exist; moreover, they are computable by solving a linear complementarity problem. The equilibrium is unique when goods are strategic complements or weak substitutes and contributions are proportional to a network centrality measure called the Bonacich index. In the case of public goods, the equilibrium is non-unique and characterized by k-order maximal independent sets. The structure of optimal <b>networks</b> is always <b>star-like</b> when the game exhibits strict or weak complements. Under public good scenarios, while <b>star-like</b> <b>networks</b> remain optimal in the best case, they also yield the worst-performing equilibria.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} a new network centrality measure {{based on the}} concept of nonbacktracking walks; that is, walks not containing subsequences of the form $uvu$ where $u$ and $v$ are any distinct connected vertices of the underlying graph. We argue that this feature can yield more meaningful rankings than traditional walk-based centrality measures. We show that the resulting Katz-style centrality measure may be computed via the so-called deformed graph Laplacian— a quadratic matrix polynomial that can be associated with any graph. By proving a range of new results about this matrix polynomial, we gain insights into the behavior of the algorithm with respect to its Katz-like parameter. The results also inform implementation issues. In particular we show that, in an appropriate limit, the new measure coincides with the nonbacktracking version of eigenvector centrality introduced by Martin, Zhang and Newman in 2014.

40|$|Introduction: Before {{embarking on}} the design of any {{computer}} system it is first necessary to assess the magnitude of the problem. In the case of a web search engine this assessment amounts to determining the current size of the web, the growth rate of the web, and the quantity of computing resource necessary to search it, and projecting the historical growth of this into the future. Method: The over 20 year history of the web makes it possible to make short-term projections on future growth. The longer history of hard disk drives (and smart phone memory card) makes it possible to make short-term hardware projections. Analysis: Historical data on Internet uptake and hardware growth is extrapolated. Results: It is predicted that within a decade the storage capacity of a single hard drive will exceed the size of the index of the web at that time. Within another decade {{it will be possible to}} store the entire searchable text on the same hard drive. Within another decade the entire searchable web (including images) will also fit. Conclusion: This result raises questions about the future architecture of search engines. Several new models are proposed. In one model the user's computer is an active part of the distributed search architecture. They search a pre-loaded snapshot (back-file) of the web on their local device which frees up the online data centre for searching just the difference between the snapshot and the current time. Advantageously this also makes it possible to search when the user is disconnected from the Internet. In another model all changes to all files are broadcast to all users (forming a <b>star-like</b> <b>network)</b> and no data centre is needed...|$|E
40|$|Replacing {{conventional}} power sources by renewable sources in current power grids drastically alters their structure and functionality. In particular, power generation in the resulting grid {{will be far}} more decentralized, with a distinctly different topology. Here, we analyze the impact of grid topologies on spontaneous synchronization, considering regular, random, and small-world topologies and focusing {{on the influence of}} decentralization. We model the consumers and sources of the power grid as second order oscillators. First, we analyze the global dynamics of the simplest non-trivial (two-node) network that exhibit a synchronous (normal operation) state, a limit cycle (power outage), and coexistence of both. Second, we estimate stability thresholds for the collective dynamics of small network motifs, in particular, <b>star-like</b> <b>networks</b> and regular grid motifs. For larger networks, we numerically investigate decentralization scenarios finding that decentralization itself may support power grids in exhibiting a stable state for lower transmission line capacities. Decentralization may thus be beneficial for power grids, regardless of the details of their resulting topology. Regular grids show a specific sharper transition not found for random or small-world grids...|$|R

The efficiency between two vertices i and j is defined to be ∈i,j = 1 dG(i,j) for all i 6 = j. The global efficiency of a graph is the average efficiency over all i 6 = j.

40|$|A {{microscopic}} method {{was developed to}} study the role of platelets in fibrin formation. Perfusion of adhered platelets with plasma under coagulating conditions at a low shear rate (250 − 1) resulted in the assembly of a <b>star-like</b> fibrin <b>network</b> at the platelet surface. The focal fibrin formation on platelets was preceded by rises in cytosolic Ca 2 +, morphologic changes, and phosphatidylserine exposure. Fibrin formation was slightly affected by αIIbβ 3 blockage, but it was greatly delayed and reduced by the following: inhibition of thrombin or platelet activation; interference in the binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to glycoprotein Ib/V/IX (GpIb-V-IX); plasma or blood from patients with type 1 von Willebrand disease; and plasma from mice deficient in VWF or the extracellular domain of GpIbα. In this process, the GpIb-binding A 1 domain of VWF was similarly effective as full-length VWF. Prestimulation of platelets enhanced the formation of fibrin, which was abrogated by blockage of phosphatidylserine. Together, these results show that, {{in the presence of}} thrombin and low shear flow, VWF-induced activation of GpIb-V-IX triggers platelet procoagulant activity and anchorage of a <b>star-like</b> fibrin <b>network.</b> This process can be relevant in hemostasis and the manifestation of von Willebrand disease...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the genetic variability of the Polish sheep breeds Świniarka, Wrzosówka, Pomorska, and Wielkopolska based on mitochondrial control region polymorphism. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis and information about the genetic origin of the breeds were also obtained. The genetic variability of the breeds studied has been assessed based on the number of haplotypes, haplotype diversity, nucleotide diversity, the average number of nucleotide differences, the number of mutations, and phylogenetically informative sites. Sequence divergence between identified haplogroup A (HA) and haplogroup B (HB) was also calculated. Moreover, a neighbour-joining (NJ) haplotype tree was constructed based on Kimura's two-parameter genetic distance calculation. Finally, the history of the population was investigated by mismatch distribution and Fu's F statistics. The 559 bp long mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (CR) sequences of 143 sheep were analysed. The 65 haplotypes were defined by 45 parsimony informative sites. Among the four Polish breeds, Wrzosówka had the highest while Świniarka the lowest values of haplotype (H d) and sequence diversity (π) (H d [*]=[*]  0. 9735 and π [*]=[*]  0. 0040 for Wrzosówka; H d [*]=[*]  0. 8975 and π [*]=[*]  0. 0030 for Świniarka).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} spatial networks that realize {{a balance between}} an infrastructure cost (the cost of wire needed to connect the network in space) and communication efficiency, measured by average shortest pathlength. A global optimization procedure yields network topologies in which this balance is optimized. These are compared with network topologies generated by a competitive process in which each node strives to optimize its own cost-communication balance. Three phases are observed in globally optimal configurations for different cost-communication trade-offs: (i) regular small worlds, (ii) <b>star-like</b> <b>networks</b> and (iii) trees with a centre of interconnected hubs. In the latter regime, i. e. for very expensive wire, power laws in the link length distributions P(w) ∝ w^-α are found, which {{can be explained by}} a hierarchical organization of the networks. In contrast, in the local optimization process the presence of sharp transitions between different network regimes depends on the dimension of the underlying space. Whereas for d=∞ sharp transitions between fully connected networks, regular small worlds and highly cliquish periphery-core networks are found, for d= 1 sharp transitions are absent and the power law behaviour in the link length distribution persists over a much wider range of link cost parameters. The measured power law exponents are in agreement with the hypothesis that the locally optimized networks consist of multiple overlapping sub-optimal hierarchical trees.

However, the genetic diversity and phylogeographic structures of the host insects remain to be explored. We analyzed the genetic diversity and temporal and spatial distribution patterns of genetic variation of the host insects throughout the O. sinensis distribution. Abundant haplotype and nucleotide diversity mainly existed in the areas of Nyingchi, ShangriLa, and around the edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where are considered as the diversity center or micro-refuges of the host insects of O. sinensis. However, there was little genetic variation among host insects from 72. 1 % of all populations, indicating that the host species composition might be relatively simple in large-scale O. sinensis populations. All host insects are monophyletic except for those from four O. sinensis populations around Qinghai Lake. Significant phylogeographic structure (NST>GST, P< 0. 05) was revealed for the monophyletic host insects, and the three major phylogenetic groups corresponded with specific geographical areas. The divergence of most host insects was estimated to have occurred at ca. 3. 7 Ma, shortly before the rapid uplift of the QTP. The geographical distribution and <b>star-like</b> <b>network</b> of the haplotypes implied that most host insects were derived from the relicts of a once-widespread host that subsequently became fragmented. Neutrality tests, mismatch distribution analysis, and expansion time estimation confirmed that most host insects presented recent demographic expansions that began ca. 0. 118 Ma in the late Pleistocene. Therefore, the genetic diversity and distribution of the present-day insects should be attributed to effects of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau uplift and glacial advance/retreat cycles during the Quaternary ice age. These results provide valuable information to guide the protection and sustainable use of these host insects as well as O. sinensis...|$|E

Dense global subnetworks of these pathways have often been studied, primarily due to their functional implications. Instead we study sparse local subnetworks of the pathways to establish {{the role of a}} brain area in enabling shortest path communication between its non-adjacent topological neighbours. We propose a novel metric to measure the topological communication load on a vertex due to its immediate neighbourhood, and show that in terms of distribution of this local communication load, a network of Macaque long distance pathways is substantially different from other real world networks and random graph models. Macaque network contains the entire range of local subnetworks, from <b>star-like</b> <b>networks</b> to clique-like networks, while other networks tend to contain a relatively small range of subnetworks. Further, sparse local subnetworks in the Macaque network are not only found across topographical super-areas, e. g., lobes, but also within a super-area, arguing that there is conservation of even relatively short-distance pathways. To establish the communication role of a vertex we borrow the concept of brokerage from social science, and present the different types of brokerage roles that brain areas play, highlighting that not only the thalamus, but also cingulate gyrus and insula often act as "relays" for areas in the neocortex. These and other analysis of communication load and roles of the sparse subnetworks of the Macaque brain provide new insights into the organisation of its pathways...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of scalability and fault-tolerance in modern distributed systems {{has led to}} considerable research in multicast protocols using gossip. In a gossip protocol, each node forwards messages to a small set of “gossip partners ” chosen at random from the entire group membership. By discarding the strong reliability guarantees of traditional protocols in favour of probabilistic guarantees, gossip protocols can deliver greater scalability and fault tolerance. In early gossip algorithms, partners were chosen uniformly at random from the entire membership, limiting scalability because of the resources required to store and maintain complete membership views at each node. Later protocols avoided this issue by storing much smaller random subsets of the membership at each node, and choosing gossip partners only from these local views. Such protocols are subtle: at least some local views must change in response to group membership changes {{in order to preserve}} connectivity and performance guarantees. While these protocols {{have been the subject of}} much simulation and analysis, formal proofs of key properties – in particular the probability of partitioning – have remained elusive. In this paper we give a new scalable gossip-based algorithm for local view maintenance, together with a proof that the expected time until a network partition is at least exponential in the square of the view size. We also develop probabilistic bounds on the in-degree (hence the load) of individual nodes, and argue that protocols lacking our reinforcement component eventually converge to <b>star-like</b> <b>networks,</b> whose connectivity depends on a small set of overloaded nodes. We also argue that the undirected connectivity graph is an expander, for which application-level gossip multi-cast protocols will converge rapidly.

40|$|International audienceThe use of {{sequence}} polymorphism from individual mitochondrial genes to infer past demography has recently proved controversial {{because of the}} recurrence of selective sweeps acting over genes {{and the need for}} unlinked multilocus data sets. However, comparative analyses using several species for one gene and/or multiple genes for one species can serve as a test for potential selective effects and clarify our understanding of historical demographic effects. This study compares nucleotide polymorphisms in mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I across seven deep-sea hydrothermal vent species that live along the volcanically active East Pacific Rise. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method, developed to trace shared vicariant events across species pairs, indicates the occurrence of two across species divergence times, and suggests that the present geographical patterns of genetic differentiation may be explained by two periods of significant population isolation. The oldest period dates back 11. 6 Ma and is associated with the vent limpet Lepetodrilus elevatus, while the most recent period of isolation is 1. 3 Ma, which apparently affected all species examined and coincides with a transition zone across the equator. Moreover, significant negative Tajima's D and <b>star-like</b> <b>networks</b> were observed for all southern lineages, suggesting that these lineages experienced a concomitant demographic and geographical expansion about 100 000 - 300 000 generations ago. This expansion may have initiated from a wave of range expansions during the secondary colonization of new sites along the Southern East Pacific Rise (founder effects below the equator) or recurrent bottleneck events because of the increase of eruptive phases associated with the higher spreading rates of the ridge in this region...|$|R

We specifically investigated whether Pleistocene climate changes affected the demography of this species. If this was the case, we expected to find changes in population size over time. Thus, we assessed the genetic diversity of S. brasiliensis to trace the demographic history of nine populations from the Upper Paraguay basin, which includes the Pantanal floodplain, that form a single genetic group, employing approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to test five scenarios: constant population, old expansion, old decline, old bottleneck following by recent expansion, and old expansion following by recent decline. Based on two mitochondrial DNA markers, our inferences from ABC analysis, the results of Bayesian skyline plot, the implications of <b>star-like</b> <b>networks,</b> and the patterns of genetic diversity (high haplotype diversity and low-to-moderate nucleotide diversity) indicated a sudden population expansion. ABC allowed us to make strong quantitative inferences about the demographic history of S. brasiliensis. We estimated a small ancestral population size that underwent a drastic fivefold expansion, probably associated with the colonization of newly formed habitats. The estimated time of this expansion was consistent with a humid and warm phase as inferred by speleothem growth phases and travertine records during Pleistocene interglacial periods. The strong concordance between our genetic inferences and this historical data could represent the first genetic record of a humid and warm phase in the Pantanal in the period since the Last Interglacial to 40 ka...|$|R
40|$|Evidence for {{a general}} lack of genetic {{differentiation}} of intertidal invertebrate assemblages in the North Atlantic, based on mtDNA sequence variation, has been interpreted as resulting from recent colonization following the Last Glacial Maximum. In the present study, the phylogeographic patterns of one nuclear and one mtDNA gene fragments of two isopods, Stenosoma lancifer (Miers, 1881) and Stenosoma acuminatum Leach, 1814, from the northeast Atlantic were investigated. These organisms have direct development, which makes them poor dispersers, and are therefore expected to maintain signatures of past historical events in their genomes. Lack of genetic structure, significant deviations from neutrality and <b>star-like</b> haplotype <b>networks</b> have been observed for both mtDNA and nuclear markers of S. lancifer, {{as well as for the}} mtDNA of S. acuminatum. No sequence variation was observed for the nuclear gene fragment of S. acuminatum. These results suggest a scenario of recent colonization and demographic expansion and/or high population connectivity driven by ocean currents and sporadic long-distance dispersal through rafting...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Present day {{distributions}} of Palearctic taxa in northern latitudes mainly result from populations having survived in local patches during the Late Pleistocene and/or from recolonizing populations from southern temperate refugia. If well-studied Mediterranean and eastern European refugia are widely accepted, some recent biogeographical assumptions still remain unclear, {{such as the}} occurrence of multiple glacial refugia in Iberia and cryptic refugia in northern Europe during the last glaciations. The Lusitanian snail Elona quimperiana has a remarkably disjunct distribution, limited to northwestern France (Brittany), northwestern Spain and the Basque Country. By describing the phylogeographical structure of this species across its entire range, the present study attempts to identify refugia and subsequent recolonization routes. Results Results based on 16 S and COI gene sequences showed that the low genetic diversity observed in the Brittany populations should {{be associated with a}} recent demographic expansion. By contrast, populations from Spain exhibit several differentiated lineages and are characterized by demographic equilibrium, while the Basque populations are the only ones harboring typical distinct haplotypes. The center of the <b>star-like</b> <b>networks</b> of both gene sequences is occupied by a common ancestral-like haplotype found in Brittany and Spain, which might have originated from the middle of Northern Spain (i. e. Asturias, eastern Lugo and western Cantabria). Estimates of the divergence time between the Spain-Brittany and Basque lineages strongly suggest that E. quimperiana survived the Pleistocene glaciations in distinct refugia on the Iberian Peninsula, one of which is situated in Picos de Europa, and the other in the Basque Country. The occurrence of a northern refugium in France cannot be rejected as of yet. Conclusion Present results confirm the Iberian origin of the land snail E. quimperian a and strongly support the emerging phylogeographic hypothesis of multiple refugia in Iberia during the last glaciations. The scenario of a spatial expansion of E. quimperiana from an Iberian refuge located in Asturias to northern areas provides the most probable explanation for the present distribution of this land snail. By harboring distinct haplotypes, the Basque Country populations appear to be of great importance in terms of potential adaptation, long term persistence and hence, the conservation of E. quimperiana. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of scalability and fault-tolerance in modern distributed systems {{has led to}} considerable research in multi-cast protocols using gossip. In a gossip protocol, each node forwards messages to a small set of ``gossip partners'' chosen at random from the entire group membership. By discarding the strong reliability guarantees of traditional protocols in favor of probabilistic guarantees, gossip protocols can deliver greater scalability and fault tolerance. In early gossip algorithms, partners were chosen uniformly at random from the entire membership, limiting scalability because of the resources required to store and maintain complete membership views at each node. Later protocols avoided this issue by storing much smaller random subsets of the membership at each node, and choosing gossip partners only from these local views. Such protocols are subtle: at least some local views must change in response to group membership changes {{in order to preserve}} connectivity and performance guarantees. While these protocols {{have been the subject of}} much simulation and analysis, formal proofs of key properties - in particular the probability of partitioning - have remained elusive. In this thesis we give a new scalable gossip-based algorithm for local view maintenance, together with a proof that the expected time until a network partition is at least exponential in the view size and the size of the departing set. We develop probabilistic bounds on the in-degree (hence the load) of individual nodes, and argue that protocols lacking our reinforcement component eventually converge to <b>star-like</b> <b>networks,</b> whose connectivity depends on a small set of overloaded nodes. We argue that the undirected connectivity graph is an expander, for which application-level gossip multi-cast protocols will converge rapidly. An analysis of the membership system under heavy churn yields a lower bound on the amount of communications required per round. Finally, we offer some arguments supporting the experimental fact that the elements of the local views - although not a uniformly random sampling of the set of nodes in the system - have a high degree of randomness and suggesting that the state of the system after O(ln n) iterations is independent of the initial state...|$|R
40|$|The giant {{jellyfish}} Nemopilema nomurai is a scyphozoan species well-known in East Asian Marginal Seas for its {{damage to}} fisheries. The genetic diversity and population structure of N. nomurai, collected from five geographic regions in Chinese coastal seas, were examined based on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and nuclear {{internal transcribed spacer}} one (ITS 1) sequences. A total of 26 and five unique haplotypes were recovered from the COI and ITS 1 genes, respectively. The overall genetic diversity of N. nomurai calculated by the COI and ITS 1 sequences was low (haplotype diversity 0. 727 % and 0. 108 %, nucleotide diversity 0. 212 % and 0. 039 %). The median-joining network analysis revealed a <b>star-like</b> haplotype <b>network.</b> The hierarchical Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) of COI haplotypes showed that N. nomurai populations form a single population, with a low FST (0. 0149, p = 0. 1036). The dispersal ability, together with the biological characteristics, could be important factors {{for the lack of}} a geographically structured pattern in N. nomurai in Chinese coastal waters...|$|R
40|$|Understanding what shapes {{variation}} in genetic diversity among species remains {{a major challenge}} in evolutionary ecology, {{and it has been}} seldom studied in parasites and other host-symbiont systems. Here, we studied mtDNA {{variation in}} a host-symbiont non-model system: 418 individual feather mites from 17 feather mite species living on 17 different passerine bird species. We explored how a surrogate of census size, the median infrapopulation size (i. e., the median number of individual parasites per infected host individual), explains mtDNA genetic diversity. Feather mite species genetic diversity was positively correlated with mean infrapopulation size, explaining 34 % of the variation. As expected from the biology of feather mites, we found bottleneck signatures for most of the species studied but, in particular, three species presented extremely low mtDNA diversity values given their infrapopulation size. Their <b>star-like</b> haplotype <b>networks</b> (in contrast with more reticulated networks for the other species) suggested that their low genetic diversity was the consequence of severe bottlenecks or selective sweeps. Our study shows {{for the first time that}} mtDNA diversity can be explained by infrapopulation sizes, and suggests that departures from this relationship could be informative of underlying ecological and evolutionary processes.

40|$|The current genetic {{structure}} of P. tortonesei, exclusively inhabiting lagoons, {{may reflect a}} Plio-Pleistocene colonisation of an ancestor line which has undergone phases of population decline and expansion, following alternate cooling phases. Regarding the calculation of divergence time, {{it has been estimated}} that P. tortonesei seems to be the most recent species within the Pomatoschistus genus. It appears also that the discrepancy of P. tortonesei into two distinct phyletic lineages occurred 0. 1 Mya. Recurring shifts in sea level and sea surface temperatures of Mediterranean Sea caused the desiccation of shallower lagoons and the consequent bottleneck phenomena of the brackish populations. Genetic differentiation in P. tortonesei seems to have been affected by its historical demography. Colonization and re-colonization processes could have had strong effects on mitochondrial genealogy lineages. The SPN showed two haplogroups for each gene, each consistent with the two main clades, W-MED and E-MED, and resulting in a <b>star-like</b> shape <b>network</b> in agreement with the expansion model. These results correlated with those obtained through neutrality statistic tests, where significantly negative values for Tajima’s D and Fu’s F statistics were most likely the result of recent population growth, since the mismatch distribution of both genes fitted the predicted distribution under a model of sudden population expansion...|$|R
