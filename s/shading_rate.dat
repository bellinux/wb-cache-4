40|$|We {{modify the}} Reyes object-space shading {{approach}} to address two inefficiencies {{that result from}} performing shading calculations at micropolygon grid vertices prior to rasterization. Our system samples shading of surface sub-patches uniformly in the object’s parametric domain, but the location of shading samples need not correspond with the location of mesh vertices. Thus we perform object-space shading that efficiencly supports motion and defocus blur, but do not require micropolygons to achieve a <b>shading</b> <b>rate</b> of one sample per pixel. Second, our system resolves surface visibility prior to shading, then lazily shades 2 x 2 sample blocks that are known {{to contribute to the}} resulting fragments. We find that in comparison to a Reyes micropolygon rendering pipeline, decoupling geometric sampling rate from <b>shading</b> <b>rate</b> permits the use of meshes containing an order of magnitude fewer vertices with minimal loss of image quality in our test scenes.

More generally, it enables extensions of modern real-time graphics pipelines that provide controllable <b>shading</b> <b>rates</b> to trade off quality for performance. It {{can be thought of}} as a generalization of GPU-style multisample antialiasing (MSAA) to support unpredictable <b>shading</b> <b>rates,</b> with arbitrary mappings from visibility to shading samples as introduced by motion blur, depth-of-field, and adaptive shading. It is inspired by the Reyes architecture in offline rendering, but targets real-time pipelines by driving shading from visibility samples as in GPUs, and removes the need for micropolygon dicing or rasterization. Decoupled Sampling works by defining a many-to-one hash from visibility to shading samples, and using a buffer to memoize shading samples and exploit reuse across visibility samples. We present extensions of two modern GPU pipelines to support decoupled sampling: a GPU-style sort-last fragment architecture, and a Larrabee-style sort-middle pipeline.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{powerful}} hardware architecture for pixel shading, which enables flexible control of <b>shading</b> <b>rates</b> and automatic <b>shading</b> reuse between triangles in tessellated primitives. The main goal is efficient pixel shading for moderately to finely tessellated geometry, {{which is not}} handled well by current GPUs. Our method effectively decouples the cost of pixel shading from the geometric complexity. It thereby enables a wider use of tessellation and fine geometry, even at very limited power budgets. The core idea is to shade over small local grids in parametric patch space, and reuse shading for nearby samples. We also support the decomposition of shaders into multiple parts, which are shaded at different frequencies. <b>Shading</b> <b>rates</b> can be locally and adaptively controlled, in order to direct the computations to visually important areas and to provide performance scaling with a graceful degradation of quality.

To improve performance, previous work often decouple shading from visibility sampling using shader caching algorithms. We present a novel technique for reusing shading in a stochastic rasterizer. Shading is computed hierarchically and sparsely in an object-space texture, and by selecting an appropriate mipmap level for each triangle, we ensure that the <b>shading</b> <b>rate</b> is sufficiently high so that no noticeable blurring is introduced in the rendered image.

40|$|Multi-sample {{anti-aliasing}} is {{a popular}} technique for reducing geometric aliasing (jagged edges) and is supported in all modern graphics processors.

Although this significantly reduces the appearance of jagged edges around object boundaries, the image quality improvement in non-silhouette regions is hardly noticeable. We propose a hardware unit, called the pixel merge unit, which is located just after the early depth test unit but before the pixel shader.

The AGAA results (red outlines) shade {{only twice}} per pixel, give comparable {{results to the}} MSAA reference image shaded eight times per pixel, and use 33 % less memory. AGAA reduces aliasing by prefiltering the scene’s sub-pixel geometric detail (foliage, thin railings, etc.) into an aggregate G-buffer that models the distribution of geometry projecting into each pixel. We present Aggregate G-Buffer Anti-Aliasing (AGAA), a new technique for efficient anti-aliased deferred rendering of complex geometry using modern graphics hardware. In geometrically com-plex situations, where many surfaces intersect a pixel, current ren-dering systems shade each contributing surface at least once per pixel. As the sample density and geometric complexity increase, the shading cost becomes prohibitive for real-time rendering. Under deferred shading, so does the required framebuffer memory. AGAA uses the rasterization pipeline to generate a compact, pre-filtered geometric representation inside each pixel. We then shade this at a fixed rate, independent of geometric complexity. By decoupling <b>shading</b> <b>rate</b> from geometric sampling rate, the algorithm reduces the storage and bandwidth costs of a geometry buffer, and allows scaling to high visibility sampling rates for anti-aliasing.

40|$|AbstractTo cover {{agricultural}} structures for protecting plants from high solar radiation in hot and sunny regions {{different types of}} shading nets are used. In summer, the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmitted through these nets usually fulfils plant growth requirements. However, their applicability in winter is still unknown. So far, the choice of nets has mostly been empirical, because technical data such as the radiometric properties {{that are used to}} characterize the different types of nets are not available. This paper presents a simple method for measuring the radiometric properties related to global and diffuse PAR of seven types of shading nets including nets with colours and <b>shading</b> <b>rates</b> that are commonly used in hot regions. A shading system was developed to simulate the diffuse PAR under cloudy conditions. The results show that under clear sunny and cloudy conditions the radiometric properties depended on both net porosity and colour. Net reflectance strongly depended on net colour. Net transmittance and absorptance depended primarily on colour and secondarily on porosity. The radiometric properties of nets under global and diffuse PAR conditions tended to be similar to those of translucent materials so that a plastic net can be considered as translucent material when investigating the equivalent optical parameters (refractive index and absorption coefficient). This can help to predict the radiometric properties of the net without the need of measurements. Under the sunny conditions of winter seasons, the structures covered with the tested nets are suitable for growing crops that can grow at PAR less than 150 Wm− 2.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{computer}} graphics {{refers to the}} use of computers to generate realistic-looking images from virtual scenes. Graphics processing units use an algorithm known as rasterization to compute images of scenes viewed from a virtual camera. The commonly used pinhole camera model does not account for the imperfections that stem from the physical limitations in real-world cameras. This includes, for example, motion and defocus blur. These two phenomena can be captured using stochastic rasterization, which is an algorithm that extends upon conventional rasterization by being able to handle moving and out-of-focus objects. Using this approach, the virtual scene is sampled at different instances in time and using different paths through the camera lens system. Alas, the extended functionality comes at a higher computational cost and consumes much more memory bandwidth. Much of the increased bandwidth usage is due to the increase in traffic to the depth buffer. The focus of the six papers included in this thesis is threefold. First, we have explored ways to reduce the high memory bandwidth consumption inherent in depth buffering, targeting both conventional and stochastic rasterization. We have evaluated a number of hardware changes, including novel compression schemes and cache improvements, which efficiently reduce memory bandwidth usage. We also propose a hardware friendly algorithm which reduces the pressure on the depth buffering system by culling unnecessary work early in the pipeline. Second, we propose an algorithm to reduce shading computations for stochastic rasterization. In our approach, we decouple shading and visibility determination into two separate passes. The surface color is sparsely evaluated in the first pass and can be efficiently used in the second pass, when rendering from the camera. The two-pass approach allows us to adaptively adjust the <b>shading</b> <b>rate</b> based on the amount of blur resulting from motion and defocus effects, which greatly reduces rendering times. Third, we propose a real-time algorithm for rendering shadows cast by objects in motion. Due to the complicated interplay between moving objects, moving light sources, and a moving camera, rendering motion blurred shadows is an especially difficult problem. Using our algorithm, high quality, smooth shadows can be achieved on conventional graphics processors.

In order to investigate the effect of pruning on the growth of trees, therefore, these relations must be fully determined. The trees should be distinguished into the sun or the shade crown in the closed stands, as light intensities remarkably vary with location of leaves in the crown and by studying a relation of leaves amount between {{the sun and the}} <b>shade</b> crowns, the <b>rate</b> of photosynthesis in the former or the latter, the CO 2 assimilation connected there with and their structure and elements, the effect of pruning on growth could be decided to a certain extent...|$|R
40|$|Understanding spatial {{relationships}} between determinants and outcomes {{of health care}} is important as the concept of population-based health care gains acceptance. A wide range of tools for understanding these spatial relationships is available to the family medicine researcher {{through the use of}} Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The power of GIS lies in its ability to display the spatial distribution of a health-related predictor or outcome. These maps can then be used to either generate or test hypotheses that would not have otherwise occurred to the investigator without visualizing the spatial relationships. The type of GIS application used is dependent on the type of data the researcher has and the research question. The three most common types of data are point or event data, lattice data, and geostatistical data. Point or event data can be displayed using a technique known as geocoding. Lattice data is most commonly displayed as shaded or colored areas where the <b>shading</b> represents <b>rates</b> or counts. Geostatistical data provides counts or numbers at a given location. The analytic techniques used for analyzing spatial data depend on the type of data. Maps tell powerful stories and display relationships that may not be obvious using other techniques.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study was}} carried out in order to {{investigate}} the early growth and root development characteristics of Peucedanum japonicum container seedlings. The experiment was performed by containers (128 and 200 cavities containers) and shading levels (0 %, 35 %, 50 % and 75 % <b>shading).</b> Germination <b>rate</b> of P. japonicum seeds was getting higher in the lower shading level and the highest in the full sunlight (71. 9 %). Plant height was the highest under 50 % shading of all containers. Fresh weight and dry weight of the shoot (leaves + stem) were the highest under 50 % shading of all containers, too. Meanwhile, fresh weight and dry weight of the root per plant were the highest under the full sunlight of 128 cavities container such as 0. 34 g and 0. 03 g, respectively. Total root length, root project area and root surface area were higher under the full sunlight of 128 cavities container such as 234. 5 ㎝, 6. 6 ㎠ and 20. 8 ㎠, respectively and the next higher was under 35 % shading such as 201. 7 ㎝, 5. 9 ㎠ and 18. 4 ㎠, respectively. A case of root volume was the highest with 0. 15 ㎤ under the full sunlight. As a result of the surveying the whole experiment, it is concluded that the shoot and root of P. japonicum seed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Aim of {{this study}} is to assess the effect of smoothing, based on the {{assumption}} that hospitalization rates may be influenced by the neighboring municipalities, the health service organization (HSO) and environmental risk factors. To smooth rates two different Multilevel Multimembership Models are fitted: in the first the random effects where the municipality heterogeneity, the spatial dependence of the municipalities and the local HSO; in the second we replaced the local HSO effect with the environmental risk effect. The models were applied to spatially represent the rates of hospitalization for lung cancer in Apulia in the year 2006. Maps <b>shaded</b> with the <b>rates</b> obtained at the end of the smoothing procedure seem to express a geographical distribution pattern in specific areas of the region. The effect of smoothing was greater in municipalities with a more unstable Risk Adjusted Rate...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{techniques}} used by software renderers to produce stunningly realistic images is programmable shading executing an arbitrarily complex program to compute the color at each pixel. Thus far, programmable shading has only been available on software rendering systems that run on general-purpose computers. Rendering each image can take from minutes to hours. Parallel rendering engines, on the other hand, have steadily increased in generality and in performance. We {{believe that they are}} nearing the point where {{they will be able to}} perform moderately complex <b>shading</b> at interactive <b>rates.</b> Some of the obstacles to this are imposed by hardware, such as limited amounts of frame-buffer memory and the enormous computational resources that are needed to shade in real time. Other obstacles are imposed by software. For example, users generally are not granted access to the hardware at the level required for programmable shading...|$|R

An extensive simulation study of passive solar buildings that have no heating or cooling system and use predictive modelling to pre-set the <b>shading</b> and ventilation <b>rates</b> of a single office space has shown promising results for producing thermal comfort in 12 orientations of all climate zones in the United States. The study considered 23 different combinations, using four types of glazing and two levels of thermal mass {{and the use of}} night insulation, where a total of 4140 yearly simulations were performed. The best performing combination was then simulated using predicted climate change weather files for the years 2050 and 2080. The results show that in some colder climates the office space is more thermally comfortable, but most of the results show worse performance due to climate change...|$|R
40|$|Widespread declines among Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) {{and brown}} trout (Salmo trutta) over recent decades {{have been linked}} to pollution, {{exploitation}} and catchment modification, but climate change is increasingly implicated. We used long-term, geographically extensive data from the Welsh River Wye, formerly a major salmon river, to examine whether climatically mediated effects on juveniles (> 0 +) might contribute to population change. Populations of Atlantic salmon and brown trout fell across the Wye catchment, respectively, by 50 % and 67 % between 1985 and 2004, but could not be explained by pollution because water quality improved during this time. Stream temperatures, estimated from calibrations against weekly air temperature at eight sites, increased by 0. 5 – 0. 7 °C in summer and 0. 7 – 1. 0 °C in winter, with larger tributaries warming more than <b>shaded</b> headwaters. <b>Rates</b> of winter warming were slightly greater after accounting for the effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation (1. 1 – 1. 4 °C). However, warming through time was smaller than measured variations among tributaries, and alone was insufficient to explain variations in salmonid density. Instead, population variations were best explained in multilevel mixed models by a synoptic variate representing a trend towards hotter, drier summers, implying interactions between climate warming, varying discharge and fluctuations in both brown trout and salmon. Taken alongside recent data showing effects of warming on survival at sea, these data suggest that Atlantic salmon might be jeopardized by future climatic effects in both their marine and freshwater stages. Effects on nondiadromous brown trout also imply climatically mediated processes in freshwaters or their catchments. Climate projections for the United Kingdom suggest that altered summer flow and increasing summer temperatures could exacerbate losses further in these species, and we advocate management actions that combine reduced abstraction with enhanced riparian shading...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Schistosoma mansoni {{is one of}} the parasites {{with high}} public and medical {{importance}} in Ethiopia. However, information is scarce about S. mansoni epidemiology in people living with higher risk of infection in Jimma town. This study was designed to determine point prevalence, intensity and risk factors of S. mansoni infection among residents nearby three rivers of Jimma town and assess the rate of Biomphalaria species shading cercariae from January to April, 2007. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in communities residing nearby three rivers of Jimma town. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data on socio- demographic and behavioral risk factors. After physical examination, stool samples were collected from 517 study participants and processed with Kato-Katz technique for microscopic examination and quantification of egg load. Snails were collected for identification of Biomphalaria species and then checked for cercarial shading. RESULTS: The prevalence of S. mansoni was 26. 3 % with intensity ranging 24 to 936 eggs per gram of stool. Participants in the age group 10 - 19 years, OR = 2. 19 (95 % CI; 1. 10 – 4. 34), and those living near the Awetu River, OR = 2. 67 (95 % CI; 1. 06 – 6. 75), had higher risk of S. mansoni infection. Moreover, water contact while crossing a river, OR = 3. 77 (95 % CI; 1. 79 – 7. 95), and swimming, OR = 2. 59 (95 % CI; 1. 37 – 4. 91, was significantly associated with infection. Biomphalaria snails collected from Chore and Awetu Rivers <b>shaded</b> higher <b>rate</b> of cercariae compared with Kito River. CONCLUSION: A moderate prevalence of S. mansoni infection was shown in the study population. Infection rate among the residents correlated with <b>rate</b> of cercarial <b>shading</b> Biomphalaria snails. Treatment of targeted groups, appropriate health education and environmental measures (e. g. snail control) are needed to improve the situation...|$|R
