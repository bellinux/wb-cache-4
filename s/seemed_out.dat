5|$|Twenty minutes later, the 16 Zuikaku torpedo planes {{arrived and}} split up to attack Enterprise. One group of torpedo bombers was {{attacked}} by two CAP Wildcats which shot down three of them and damaged a fourth. On fire, the fourth damaged aircraft purposely crashed into the destroyer , setting the ship on fire and killing 57 of her crew. The torpedo carried by this aircraft detonated shortly after impact, causing more damage. The fires initially <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> of control until Smiths commanding officer ordered the destroyer to steer into the large spraying wake of the battleship , which helped put out the fires. Smith then resumed her station, firing her remaining anti-aircraft guns at the torpedo planes.|$|E
5|$|By May 1247, as-Salih Ayyub was {{master of}} Syria south of Lake Homs, having gained control over Banyas and Salkhad. With his fellow Ayyubid opponents subdued, except for Aleppo under an-Nasir Yusuf, as-Salih Ayyub {{undertook}} a limited offensive against the Crusaders, sending Fakhr ad-Din {{to move against}} their territories in the Galilee. Tiberias fell on 16 June, followed by Mount Tabor and Kawkab al-Hawa soon thereafter. Safad with its Templar fortress <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> of reach, so the Ayyubids marched south to Ascalon. Facing stubborn resistance from the Crusader garrison, an Egyptian flotilla was sent by as-Salih Ayyub to support the siege and on 24 October, Fakhr ad-Din's troops stormed through a breach in the walls and killed or captured the entire garrison. The city was razed and left deserted.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{difficulties}} and instability at board level led to six managerial changes in seven years. Saunders resigned after FA Cup defeat to non-league Altrincham, John Bond <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> of touch, and in April 1989, once relegation to the Third Division {{for the first}} time in the club's history was confirmed, the club's new owners replaced Garry Pendrey with Dave Mackay. Within 18 months, with relegation to the Fourth Division a possibility, Mackay resigned. Lou Macari came in, revitalised the side, won the Associate Members' Cup at Wembley, and three weeks later walked out to join Stoke City. Terry Cooper won promotion back to the second tier and kept the team going during four months of administration before he quit, fearing new owner David Sullivan would want to bring in his own man.|$|E

5|$|From the Tech 20-yard line, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 13-yard pass to Still {{for a first}} down at the Tech 33-yard line. On the next play, Druckenmiller {{completed a}} long pass to tight end Bryan Jennings, who carried the ball 41 yards. Following the play, the Volunteers completed a penalty, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tennessee 22-yard line. Two short runs advanced the Hokies to the 19-yard line, then Druckenmiller completed a 10-yard pass to Freeman for a first down. On the next play, Druckenmiller connected with Still for a nine-yard touchdown pass. The extra point was good, and Tennessee's lead was cut to 4523, but with only 4:13 remaining in the game, the game <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> of reach for the Hokies.|$|E
25|$|A Twenty20 charity {{match was}} held between Bangladesh and a New Zealand Cricket XI with {{the funds raised}} going to people {{affected}} by Cyclone Sidr; the International Cricket Council donated an additional US$250,000 to the funds {{at the start of}} the match. Asked to bat first, the New Zealand side had a slow start, having made just 19 runs for the loss of two wickets after 5.3 overs. Most of the batsmen <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> of form and fell to injudicious shots, with an unbeaten 33 from James Marshall seeing the side through to 133 for seven from their 20 overs.|$|E
25|$|According to Glazer (1980, p.111), from 15 May 1948 onwards, {{expulsion}} of Palestinians became a regular practice. Avnery (1971), explaining the Zionist rationale, says, I believe that during this phase, the eviction of Arab civilians {{had become an}} aim of David Ben-Gurion and his government… UN opinion {{could very well be}} disregarded. Peace with the Arabs <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> of the question, considering the extreme nature of the Arab propaganda. In this situation, it was easy for people like Ben-Gurion to believe the capture of uninhabited territory was both necessary for security reasons and desirable for the homogeneity of the new Hebrew state.|$|E

25|$|By 1921–2 the {{coalition}} had become embroiled {{in an air}} of moral and financial corruption (e.g. the sale of honours). Besides the recent Irish Treaty and Edwin Montagu's moves towards greater self-government for India, both of which dismayed rank-and-file Conservative opinion, the government's willingness to intervene against the Bolshevik regime in Russia also <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> {{of step with the}} new and more pacifist mood. A sharp slump in 1921 and a wave of strikes in the coal and railway industries also added to the government's unpopularity, as did the apparent failure of the Genoa Conference, which ended in an apparent rapprochement between Germany and Soviet Russia. In other words, it was no longer the case that Lloyd George was an electoral asset to the Conservative Party.|$|E
25|$|A few Indians {{played as}} members of the English cricket team while India was under British rule, {{including}} Ranjitsinhji and KS Duleepsinhji, but India made its debut as a Test-cricket-playing-nation in England in 1932 led by CK Nayudu, well before Indian independence. The team performed well, with Mohammad Nissar taking 5-93 and 1-42 in the match against England. The match was given test status despite being only 3 days in length. England, batting first, scored 258 with Nissar cleaning up the openers and tailenders. However the Indian team failed to capitalize on their bowling performance, all out for 189 with CK Nayudu the top scorer with 40 runs. England went on to score 275 and set India a target of 346, which always <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> of the visitor's grasp. India were all out for 187 and lost by 158 runs.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{found that}} the {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) was lacking, and recommended the game's multiplayer. Opinions were generally mixed {{on the subject of}} voice acting.

500|$|Despite having {{initially}} filmed {{the scenes}} involving Francis Dollarhyde with an elaborate tattoo across Noonan's chest, Mann and Spinotti {{felt that the}} finished result <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> of place and that it [...] "trivialize the struggle" [...] the character faced. Mann cut the scenes in which the character appeared bare-chested, and quickly re-shot additional footage to replace what had been removed. Spinotti noted that in doing so, scenes which he felt had been captured with a [...] "beautiful" [...] aesthetic were lost, as the production {{did not have the}} time to recreate the original lighting conditions.|$|E
500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic complimented the {{performances}} by Betsy Brandt and Aaron Paul, and {{said of the}} latter, [...] "Seriously, does any actor on TV convey more by saying less than Aaron Paul?" [...] He also compared Skyler's increasingly calculated approach to Walter's drug dealing to Gus' personality. New York magazine writer Logan Hill praised Brandt's performance {{and said it was}} interesting to see an episode so focused on Skyler and Marie on a show usually dominated by the male characters. However, he said Skyler's transformation from concerned wife to competent criminal partner felt too sudden. Not all reviews were positive. Slate writers June Thomas and Jessica Grose both enjoyed Marie in [...] "Open House", but both felt the scenes at Jesse's house were too over-the-top and that Skyler's concerns about Walter's safety <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> of character.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, [...] "Long John Peter" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television sources and critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote that [...] "Long John Peter" [...] was [...] "thoroughly entertaining {{from start to}} finish, and {{is a great way}} to end this short season on a high note." [...] He praised the action sequence, calling it [...] "truly inspired" [...] and [...] "extremely well scripted", and graded the episode 8.9 out of 10. Brad Trechak of TV Squad stated that [...] "the pirate segment of the episode wasn't very good and <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> of place", though he also praised the action scene. He enjoyed the plot line about Chris and Anna, and called the episode [...] "a high note". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "the pirate gag was fine enough, in that it resulted in an amusing land-battle sequence" [...] and [...] "Chris' storyline resulted in some of the best Family Guy laughs I've had in a while". She graded the episode A-.|$|E
500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{praised the}} episode for {{highlighting}} {{each of its}} characters, all of whom he said were at their best except for April, who he said <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> {{of place in the}} camping storyline. He also said he was glad Ann's recent breakup with Chris [...] "has allowed her true colors to shine through". Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic called it a [...] "tremendously enjoyable episode" [...] and [...] "mostly just a chance to sit back and spend time with these goofy, lovable individuals". He praised the new storyline for Ann Perkins, claiming it created more comedic potential for Jones. Matt Fowler of IGN praised the performance of Rashida Jones and Chris Pratt, and called Leslie's stress over failing {{to come up with a}} new idea a [...] "great little story". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said [...] "Camping" [...] was not as funny as previous third season episodes but was still an enjoyable episode that he found more [...] "slow and contemplative", which he found indicative of the fact that the series was still on a strong track.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} of the vessel was designed by Zimmerman, who visited United States Navy fast-attack submarines for inspiration. He also kept in mind the heritage of the other ships named Enterprise {{in the history of}} Star Trek. The designs attempted to allow a greater freedom of filming angles than seen in previous Star Trek series. The bridge stations were originally designed with both angular and tubular elements, but the tubular elements were dropped as they <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> of place. John Eaves created the designs for the stations, while Mike and Denise Okuda, Jim Van Over and Anthony Fredrickson created the mechanical and detailed elements. Inspiration was taken from United States Navy ships and the Space Shuttle, such as the inclusion of operations manuals on some of the stations such as communications. Other elements that were added included a switch from the touch screen controls seen in series such as The Next Generation to more hands-on dials and buttons as appeared in The Original Series. The set also included what was described as [...] "busy boxes" [...] by the crew, which were parts of the consoles that folded out and were filled with wires - so that background actors could look busy during a shot when Enterprise was being refitted or when there was battle damage to be seen on screen.|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club Andy Battaglia {{rated the}} {{compilation}} an A−, noting its dissimilarity to Morricone's more well-known work. Battaglia complimented {{the arrangement of}} the tracks, feeling that they flowed into one another well, and noted the range of genres the collection represented. Danny Fasold of The Roanoke Times has commented on the wide variety of styles the collection contains, adding that it proves [...] "Morricone always delivered something interesting". Stylus Magazine Cameron Macdonald rated the album an A−, finding that the [...] "kitsch" [...] mass-market appeal of Morricone's better-known western scores made Crime and Dissonance a more [...] "relevant" [...] record. However, Macdonald felt that album's second disc was the weaker of the two, finding that the [...] "slapstick" [...] nature of some of its pieces <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> of place. Dave Gurney of Tiny Mix Tapes rated Crime and Dissonance three-and-a-half out of five, calling it [...] "a group of Morricone's most uncompromising works". However, Gurney questioned the target audience of the collection, believing {{that it would not be}} likely to appeal to casual listeners while not presenting much new material for dedicated Morricone collectors. An anonymous review for The Stranger described the album as proof that [...] "there's much more to the maestro than his revered spaghetti-western work for Sergio Leone". The review highlighted the range of genres present in the collection, calling the end result a [...] "deluge of otherworldly, endlessly fascinating sounds".|$|E
500|$|In the 1969–70 NBA season {{under new}} coach Joe Mullaney, the Lakers' season {{began with a}} shock when Wilt Chamberlain seriously injured his knee and missed {{practically}} the whole regular season. As after Baylor's injury years before, West stepped into the void, leading the NBA in scoring average with 31.2points per game, and averaging 4.6rebounds and 7.5assists per game, earning him his first of four All-Defensive First Team vote and another All-NBA First Team berth after two Second Team years. The Lakers won 46 games, and in the 1970 NBA Playoffs, they narrowly beat the Phoenix Suns in seven games and swept the Hawks in four, setting up the first NBA Finals between the Lakers and the rugged New York Knicks, led by Hall-of-Famers, such as Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, and Walt Frazier. L.A. and N.Y. split the first two games, with both games respectively decided by centers Reed and the still-hobbling Chamberlain. In Game 3, DeBusschere hit a mid-range jump shot with three seconds left to put the Knicks ahead 102–100, and the Lakers had no time-outs left. Chamberlain inbounded the ball to West, who raced past Walt Frazier and threw up a 60-foot shot. Frazier later commented: [...] "The man's crazy. He looks determined. He thinks it's really going in!" [...] West incredibly connected, and this basket was later {{called one of the}} greatest moments ever by the NBA. As the three-point line had not been introduced yet, the shot just tied the game. In overtime, West however sprained his left hand and missed all five of his shots, and the Knicks won 111-108. In Game 4, the guard scored 37points and 18assists, and the Lakers won. However, more frustration awaited West in Game 5, when Reed pulled his thigh muscle and <b>seemed</b> <b>out</b> for the series; instead of capitalising on a double-digit lead and reeling off an easy win, the Lakers committed 19 second half turnovers, and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times, respectively, in the entire second half and lost 107-100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history. After Chamberlain scored 45points and West 31points plus 13assists in a series-equalising 135-113 Lakers win, the Lakers seemed favorites prior to Game 7. However, West had also injured his right hand and received several manual injections, and Reed famously hobbled up court prior to Game 7: the Knicks center scored the first fourpoints, and inspired his team {{to one of the most}} famous playoff upsets of all time. With his injured hands, West still hit nine of his 19 shots, but was outplayed by Walt Frazier, who scored 36points and 19assists and was credited with several crucial steals on Lakers guard Dick Garrett.|$|E
