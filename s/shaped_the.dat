5|$|Several ice ages <b>shaped</b> <b>the</b> land through glacial erosion, {{creating}} u-shaped {{valleys and}} depositing boulder clays, {{especially on the}} western seaboard. The last major incursion of ice peaked about 18,000 years ago, leaving other remnant features such at the granite tors on the Cairngorm mountain plateaux.|$|E
5|$|The Cambrian {{radiation}} saw {{an explosion}} in the variety of animal body plans, from flatworms and molluscs to arthropods and vertebrates.

5|$|The brewery's blood {{red heart}} shield and dagger logo was {{introduced}} in 1863.

5|$|The {{history of}} the Central Troy Historic District is, {{particularly}} in its earlier years, the history of Troy itself. Until the later 19th century, the present downtown area was the city. Two devastating fires, along with changes in the economy brought about by industrialization, <b>shaped</b> <b>the</b> district into today's architecturally diverse downtown.|$|E
5|$|Variations {{of oxygen}} <b>shaped</b> <b>the</b> climates of the past. When oxygen declined, {{atmospheric}} density dropped and {{this in turn}} increased surface evaporation, and led to precipitation increases and warmer temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Although {{most of the}} character's {{specifications}} {{could be}} customized, some elements were {{to be determined by}} the game's two character types, Legendary and Dreaded. Choosing a type {{at the beginning of the}} game affected several gameplay and story elements. Each character type had unique features that <b>shaped</b> <b>the</b> way the game was experienced, including how the environment and non-playable characters interacted with the player.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} colonial period, {{under the rule}} of the House of Bourbon, the ideas of the Enlightenment on public health and social control <b>shaped</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of Lima. New buildings undertaken during this period include a cockfighting coliseum and a bullring, the Plaza de toros de Acho, as well as the General Cemetery. The first two were built to regulate these popular activities by centralizing them at a single venue, while the cemetery {{put an end to the}} practice of burials at churches which was considered unhealthy by public authorities.|$|E
5|$|Improving {{opportunities}} for growing families of same-sex couples has <b>shaped</b> <b>the</b> political landscape {{within the past}} ten years. A push for same-sex marriage or civil unions in western countries has replaced other political objectives. , ten countries and six U.S. states offer same-sex marriage; civil unions are offered as an option in some European countries, U.S. states and individual municipalities. The ability to adopt domestically or internationally children or provide a home as a foster parent is also a political and family priority for many lesbians, as is improving access to artificial insemination.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{built as}} a prayer hall with five aisles and a modest central courtyard, the mosque has since been {{expanded}} multiple times with additional installations completely surrounding the original structure. Many of Egypt's rulers have <b>shaped</b> <b>the</b> art and architecture of al-Azhar, from the minarets added by the Mamluks and the gates added during Ottoman rule to more recent renovations such as the installation of a new mihrab. None of the original minarets or domes have survived, {{with some of the}} current minarets having been rebuilt several times.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} design {{in the creation of}} new firms. A new interpretation of firm design is developed to explain the dynamics of entrepreneurship. This paper seeks to expand the conversation between design and management studies by focusing on <b>the</b> concept of <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> firm. The study of <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of <b>the</b> firm seeks to characterise the dependencies between the features of products and the organizational possibilities of new firms. We intersect theories from the fields of management and design theory to examine <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of <b>the</b> firm in the entrepreneurship context. From this study, opportunities are identified for research approaches to address the entanglement between <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of <b>the</b> product and <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of <b>the</b> firm. Implications for practice are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Many early Northern sports {{players were}} {{working class and}} needed to miss work to play, with their teams {{compensating}} them for lost wages. By contrast, Southern teams, drawing from the traditions of public schools and Oxbridge, put great emphasis on amateurism and the Southern-dominated governing bodies forbade payments to players. This tension <b>shaped</b> <b>the</b> sports of association football and cricket, {{and led to the}} schism between the two main forms of rugby. The North is also associated with the animal sports of dog racing with whippets, pigeon racing and ferret legging, although these are now far more popular in stereotype than in reality.|$|E
5|$|McQuarrie and Alexander {{researched}} first-hand accounts, photos, newsreels and texts. They {{also examined}} Gestapo and SS records, as the organizations had been meticulous in reconstructing {{the events of}} the conspiracy in its aftermath. A timeline of events was created, from which McQuarrie and Alexander <b>shaped</b> <b>the</b> script. After production began in Berlin, the writers were able to visit locations and meet with relatives of the conspirators; these meetings informed changes made to the script during filming.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instruments}} such as zithers {{appeared in}} Chinese writings around 12th century BC and earlier. Early Chinese philosophers such as Confucius (551–479 BC), Mencius (372–289 BC), and Laozi <b>shaped</b> <b>the</b> development of musical instruments in China, adopting an attitude toward music {{similar to that}} of the Greeks. The Chinese believed that music was an essential part of character and community, and developed a unique system of classifying their musical instruments according to their material makeup.|$|E

5|$|New England whaling ships hunting {{sperm whales}} in the Pacific began {{to arrive in}} Hawaii in 1819, and many ships {{anchored}} in Honolulu and Lahaina.
