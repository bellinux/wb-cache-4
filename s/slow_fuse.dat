The {{electric}} pinnace went off as he spoke, her steam-engines, steering-gear, {{and all the other}} apparatus being regulated by electric wires, which were [...] "paid out" [...] from the ship as the boat proceeded on her mission of supposed extreme danger. Right under the withering fire of the imaginary enemy's batteries she went, and having scorned the rain of small shot that swept over her like hail, and escaped the plunging heavy shot that fell on every side, she dropped a mine over her stern, exploded it by means of a <b>slow</b> <b>fuse,</b> turned round and steamed back in triumph, amid the cheers of the spectators.|$|E

I began to speculate, for when my wind left me my dander got hotter and hotter, and I knew I'd never know peace of mind till I dined on roasted mammoth-foot. And I knew, also, that that stood for skookum mamook pukapuk--excuse Chinook, I mean there was a big fight coming. Now the mouth of my valley was very narrow, and the walls steep. High up on one side was one of those big pivot rocks, or {{balancing}} rocks, as some call them, weighing all of a couple of hundred tons. Just the thing. I hit back for camp, keeping an eye open so the bull couldn't slip past, and got my ammunition. It wasn't worth anything with the rifle smashed; so I opened the shells, planted the powder under the rock, and touched it off with <b>slow</b> <b>fuse.</b> Wasn't much of a charge, but the old boulder tilted up lazily and dropped down into place, with just space enough to let the creek drain nicely. Now I had him." ...|$|E

50|$|The two fireships were {{successfully}} {{used in the}} night of 4-5 April 1585. Giambelli had prepared 32 normal fireships to be first launched in several waves to deceive the Spaniards. In fact the commander supervising the operation, Vice-Admiral Jacob Jacobsen, set all ships on their course in quick succession, from fort Boerenschans, the hellburners last. The current and ebb tide carried the ships towards the bridge. As their decks were piled with wood and small charges with <b>slow</b> <b>fuses</b> were apparent, all made the impression of being conventional fireships, causing the Spanish troops to try to extinguish the fire.|$|R

5000|$|The FBI leased three {{adjacent}} rooms in Times Square. One room {{would serve as}} double-agent Sebold's office from which he would receive intelligence reports from Abwehr spies that would later be censored by the FBI and partially transmitted by Sebold via coded short-wave radio to Germany. The other two rooms were used by German-speaking FBI agents who would listen in with headphones and record the meetings using a motion picture camera behind a two-way wall mirror. The first time Duquesne arrived at Sebold's office, he surprised the FBI agents by conducting {{an examination of the}} office, opening chests, looking in corners and around mirrors, and pointedly asking Sebold, [...] "where are the mics?" [...] Once Duquesne believed he was safe, he raised his pants leg and removed documents from his sock, such as: a sketch and photo of the M1 Garand semi-automatic rifle, a drawing of a new light tank design, a photo of a U.S. Navy Mosquito boat, a photo of a grenade launcher, and reports on U.S. tanks he had observed at bases at West Point and in Tennessee. Duquesne also described sabotage techniques he had used in earlier wars such as small bombs with <b>slow</b> <b>fuses</b> he could drop through a hole in his pants pocket, and he commented on where he might use these devices again.|$|R

5000|$|... "That's the Way Love Goes" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Janet Jackson, {{released}} as the lead single from her fifth studio album janet. (1993). Written and produced by Jackson and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, the single saw Jackson transitioning to sensual territory and themes of romantic lust, considered a shocking contrast to her previous releases among critics and the public. The song's <b>slow</b> tempo <b>fused</b> pop, R&B, funk and soul with flourishes of downtempo and hip hop music. It received positive reception from contemporary music critics, who praised it as [...] "iconic," [...] "hypnotic," [...] and an [...] "extravaganza" [...] for its production and vocals.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{exploding}} shells {{from field}} artillery became relatively commonplace from {{early in the}} 19th century. Until the mid 19th century, shells remained as simple exploding spheres that used gunpowder, set off by a <b>slow</b> burning <b>fuse.</b> They were usually made of cast iron, but bronze, lead, brass and even glass shell casings were experimented with. The word bomb encompassed them at the time, as heard in the lyrics of The Star-Spangled Banner ("the bombs bursting in air"), although today that sense of bomb is obsolete. Typically, {{the thickness of the}} metal body was about a sixth of their diameter and they were about two thirds the weight of solid shot of the same calibre.|$|R
50|$|Beer {{consisted}} of a cylindrical metal container 8+1/2 in in diameter and 9 in long containing seven or eight half-pint bottles. Each bottle was a SIP grenade - it contained white phosphorus, benzene, water and a strip of raw rubber, 2 in long, which dissolved and formed a layer. After a delay caused by a <b>slow</b> burning <b>fuse,</b> the metal container was tipped open and its contents allowed to fall out. Around {{the neck of the}} bottle was a small metal sleeve that held a heavy ball about 1 in in diameter. The ball was attached to a strip of canvas; this ensured that when the bottles dropped they fell the right way round. The SIP grenades would spontaneously ignite on shattering.|$|R

50|$|The 30-gun, 450-ton Medemblik ran aground and {{was left}} behind for the exultant Spanish. Juan de Amézquita boarded her and {{extinguished}} the <b>slow</b> <b>fuse</b> that was burning toward her magazine. De Haro was unable to savor the victory because a cannon had exploded near him during these final exchanges, spraying him with two dozen fragments that eventually killed him. Hendricksz, meanwhile, retired to San Francisco Bay for a month {{to recover from the}} setback. In addition to the loss of Medemblik, numerous other Dutch vessels had sustained damage, and 200 men have perished (as opposed to 17 Spanish fatalities during the siege). Hendricksz nonetheless detached his five best vessels on a privateering cruise toward Santo Domingo before attempting to lead his entire fleet west again in late November. Driven back by storms, he cruised south toward Isla Margarita (Venezuela), despite advance warnings having preceded him.|$|E
40|$|According {{to music}} pedagogue Randall Allsup (2003 : 157), praxis is “not simply the {{capacity}} to imagine alternative scenarios, but is instead the <b>slow</b> burning <b>fuse</b> of possibility and action. ” This paper will examine the role of uncertainty and praxis in the creative writing classroom, paying {{particular attention to the}} role of prose workshopping. First, it will offer an overview of praxis and then it will argue that, when successful, creative writing pedagogy offers praxis: that is, students learn to imagine their writing in different ways through workshopping (possibility) and to enact those changes through the rewriting process (action). Then, it will explore practical ways of addressing authority in the workshop arena as well as the importance of supplementary readings.

30|$|Both {{cognitive}} and algorithmic fusion hindered processing {{of the individual}} source images relative to independent parallel processing. Because information was redundant across the two images, participants should be faster with two images than with a single image, even with independent parallel processing of each image (cf. Raab, 1962). Subjects were slightly faster with the side-by-side images than the single-source images; however, the capacity {{results indicate that the}} speed-up was not as much as would be observed from independent parallel processing. Performance was even worse with the algorithmically fused images: RTs were <b>slower</b> with algorithmically <b>fused</b> images than with either of the single-sensor images. Hence, capacity coefficient values were quite low for algorithmic fusion, much lower than cognitive fusion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first attempt}} to make the process of firing a small arm easier was the [...] "matchlock". The matchlock {{incorporated}} a [...] "lock" [...] (so called because of its resemblance to door locks of the day) that was actuated by a trigger, originally called a [...] "tricker." [...] The lock was a simple lever which pivoted when pulled, and lowered the match down to the touchhole. The match was a <b>slow</b> burning <b>fuse</b> made of plant fibers that were soaked in a solution of nitrates, charcoal, and sulfur, and dried. This [...] "slow-match" [...] was ignited before the gun was needed, and it would slowly burn, keeping a hot ember at the burning end. After the gun was loaded and the touchhole primed with powder, the burning tip of the match was positioned so that the lock would bring it {{into contact with the}} touchhole. To fire the gun, it was aimed and the trigger pulled. This brought the match down to the touchhole, igniting the powder. With careful attention the slow-burning match could be kept burning for long periods of time, {{and the use of the}} lock mechanism made fairly accurate fire possible.|$|R

5000|$|The {{balloons}} {{used were}} surplus weather balloons {{of which the}} Navy had a stock of 100,000 all carefully stored in French chalk. Using this surplus was important to the practicality of Operation Outward because white latex rubber from which they were made was an important war material that was in short supply. The balloons were about 8 ft in diameter when inflated. They carried a simple timing and regulating mechanism that was based upon a design developed for Operation Albino [...] - [...] a plan to use somewhat larger latex balloons in an anti-aircraft role. At launch, a slow-burning fuse was lit; its length was calibrated to the estimated time to arrive over German-controlled territory. At first, the balloon rose rapidly and expanded in size until an internal cord tightened, preventing further increase in altitude beyond 25000 ft by releasing some gas; the balloon would then begin a slow descent due to the hydrogen gradually leaking away. After a while, the <b>slow</b> burning <b>fuse</b> would release a bung in a can of mineral oil; as the oil slowly dripped out, the balloon's payload would lighten, arresting its descent. The same slow-burning fuse was also used to release the balloon's weapon.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. {{soldiers}} {{were met with}} concentrated fire from hundreds of German weapons. One squad managed to crawl forward to a slight rise about 80 yards m {{from the edge of}} the forest. From there, they were able to call in accurate artillery fire. They could not penetrate the barbed wire, and withdrew. The fight continued for two more days with little progress. On the first day, the battle for the crossing earned the nickname that stuck with it after the war, the Battle of Heartbreak Crossroads. The Americans pulled their troops back and called in American artillery, including the huge 155mm Long Tom cannon, which repeatedly targeted the pill boxes. The Americans tried to clear the waves of barbed wire with bangalore torpedoes but their progress was <b>slowed</b> by wet <b>fuses.</b>|$|R
500|$|Teach {{captured}} a French merchant vessel, renamed her Queen Anne's Revenge, and equipped her with 40 guns. He became a renowned pirate, his nickname derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance; he {{was reported to}} have tied lit <b>fuses</b> (<b>slow</b> matches) under his hat to frighten his enemies. [...] He formed an alliance of pirates and blockaded the port of Charles Town, South Carolina, ransoming the port's inhabitants. He then ran Queen Anne's Revenge aground on a sandbar near Beaufort, North Carolina. [...] He parted company with Bonnet and settled in Bath Town, where he accepted a royal pardon. [...] But he was soon back at sea, where he attracted the attention of Alexander Spotswood, the Governor of Virginia. [...] Spotswood arranged for a party of soldiers and sailors to capture the pirate, which they did on 22November 1718 following a ferocious battle. Teach and several of his crew were killed by a small force of sailors led by Lieutenant Robert Maynard.|$|R
40|$|A {{switching}} strategy {{mediated by}} brainstem omni-directional pause neurons (OPNs) is proposed to <b>fuse</b> <b>slow</b> and fast phases of orienting eye and head movements {{in a model}} of gaze control. It is implemented in the anatomically based model developed by Galiana and Guitton (1992) where slow and fast components of gaze are represented as two different operating modalities of the same neural circuit. No comprehensive mechanism for alternating between the two modes of operation yet exists; {{it is in fact}} one of the least understood aspects of oculomotor control. Switching strategies that are implemented in existing models are usually designed artificially just to obtain a desired system response. The mechanism presented in this thesis employs a linear weighted sum of three anatomically relevant inputs to OPNs; gaze motor error, head velocity and eye velocity. It is designed to accurately decide when one phase should be ended and the other initiated in all types of behaviorally observed gaze movements. Simulated performance reveals that the implemented switching mechanism compels the model to respond appropriately to both visual and vestibular stimuli...|$|R

However, the {{approaching}} Beep-beep belongs to a truck and not the Road Runner, and thus the coyote lacks sufficient time to escape the glue; he tries anyway and cannot leap far enough before he gets stuck, and can only watch as he is flattened. Wile E. thus tries another method: covering a low rockface with glue and preparing, from a distance, to throw dynamite at the Road Runner. However, the bird's velocity causes the glue to part sideways, drowning Wile E. in his hiding place and preventing him from throwing the dynamite. After failing at this and at blowing out the fuse, he begins walking with his hips (his legs are glued to the stick) {{in an effort to}} allow the wind to snuff or <b>slow</b> the burning <b>fuse,</b> then jumps into a nearby river; however, the explosive detonates about three feet above, and the coyote pauses in midair before he falls into the water.|$|R
40|$|Skeletal muscle {{progenitor}} cells (SMPs) {{are critical}} for muscle repair in responseto injury. In vivo, SMPs reside in a niche under the basement membranein muscle fibers and will activate and proliferate or differentiate in response tosoluble factors released during injury. Here we sought to use two human muscledisorders, chronic rotator cuff tendon (RCT) tears and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), to characterize changes to the SMP niche in vivo and corresponding changes in SMP phenotype maintenance ex vivo. Tears in RCTs have known long term effects on RC muscle atrophy, fibrosis, and fatty infiltration, with lasting damage even after surgical tendon repair. The inability of the RC muscles to recover from chronic RC tear indicates possible defects in muscle repair mechanisms. We investigated if muscle injury state was a crucial factor during human SMP expansion and differentiation ex vivo. SMPs were isolated from muscles in patients with no, partial-thickness (PT), or full-thickness (FT) RCT tears. Despite using growth factors, physiological niche stiffness, and muscle-mimetic extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, we found that SMPs isolated from human RC muscle with RCT tears proliferated <b>slower</b> but <b>fused</b> into myosin heavy chain (MHC) -positive myotubes at higher rates than SMPs from untorn RCTs. Proteomic analysis of RC muscle tissue revealed shifts in muscle composition with pathology, as muscle from massive RCTs had increased ECM deposition compared with no tear RC muscle. Similarly, a proteomic analysis of muscle tissue taken from DMD patients revealed corresponding shifts in ECM and cytoskeletal protein expression with disease. Both analyses illustrate potential changes in the SMP niche, with increased fibrosis and decreases in basement membrane proteins. Together these data underscore the importance of how the niche, both in and ex vivo, prime SMPs for expansion, self-renewal and differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Contractile {{proteins}} are encoded by multigene families, most {{of whose}} members are differentially expressed in fast- versus slow-twitch myofibers. This fiber-type-specific gene regulation occurs by unknown mechanisms and does not occur within cultured myocytes. We have developed a transient, whole-animal assay using somatic gene transfer to study this phenomenon and have identified a fiber-type-specific regulatory element within the promoter region of a slow myofiber-specific gene. A plasmid-borne luciferase reporter gene fused to various muscle-specific contractile gene promoters was differentially expressed when injected into slow- versus fast-twitch rat muscle: the luciferase gene was preferentially expressed in <b>slow</b> muscle when <b>fused</b> to a <b>slow</b> troponin I promoter, and conversely, was preferentially expressed in fast muscle when fused to a fast troponin C promoter. In contrast, the luciferase gene was equally well expressed by both muscle types when fused to a nonfiber-type-specific skeletal actin promoter. Deletion analysis of the troponin I promoter region revealed that a 157 -bp enhancer conferred slow-muscle-preferential activity upon a minimal thymidine kinase promoter. Transgenic analysis confirmed the role of this enhancer in restricting gene expression to slow-twitch myofibers. Hence, somatic gene transfer {{may be used to}} rapidly define elements that direct myofiber-type-specific gene expression prior to the generation of transgenic mice...|$|R
