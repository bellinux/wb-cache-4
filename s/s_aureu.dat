30|$|Staphylococcus <b>aureu</b> <b>s</b> is a Gram-positive {{bacterium}} {{regarded as}} an etiologic agent {{of a wide range}} of diseases associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is a leading cause of nosocomial infections (Jabra-Rizk et al. [2006]). In this study S. aureus was selected as a model biofilm-forming organism given its profound association with serious biofilm-mediated pathologies. For instance, it has been established that Staphylococcus spp. biofilms account for more than a half of infections associated with prosthetic devices (Fluckiger et al. [2005]). In addition, S. aureus colonize diabetic, pressure and venous ulcers as well as burn wounds which can result in non-healing infection and may even lead to death. Additionally, S. aureus biofilms are involved in the first stage of cystic fibrosis (CF), as well as in chronic otitis media and osteomyelitis (Lindsay and von Holy [2006]). Unfortunately, all the antibiotics that are currently in use today have been developed to act against dividing phase planktonic bacteria and there is a pressing need for compounds that can selectively act on staphylococcal biofilms (Elliot et al.

In both of these cell types S. aureus promptly escapes from the endosomes/phagosomes and proliferates within the cytoplasm, which quickly leads to host cell death. In this report we show that S. aureus interacted with human monocyte-derived macrophages in a very different way to those of other mammalian cells.

Antibiotic resistant bacteria (such as S. aureus) often complicate the treatment and healing of the patient, yet, medical devices are needed to heal such patients. Therefore, methods to treat these biofilms once formed on medical devices are badly needed. Due to their small size and magnetic properties, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) may be one possible material to penetrate biofilms and kill or slow the growth of bacteria. In this study, SPION were functionalized with amine, carboxylate, and isocyanate functional groups to further improve their efficacy to disrupt the growth of S. aureus biofilms. Without the use of antibiotics, results showed that SPION functionalized with carboxylate groups (followed by isocyanate then amine functional groups then unfunctionalized SPION) significantly disrupted biofilms and retarded the growth of S. aureus compared to untreated biofilms (by over 35 % after 24 hours).

40|$|Upon {{contact with}} human plasma, {{bacteria}} are rapidly {{recognized by the}} complement system that labels their surface for uptake and clearance by phagocytic cells. Staphylococcus aureus secretes the 16 kD Extracellular fibrinogen binding protein (Efb) that binds two different plasma proteins using separate domains: the Efb N-terminus binds to fibrinogen, while the C-terminus binds complement C 3. In this study, we show that Efb blocks phagocytosis of S. aureus by human neutrophils. In vitro, we demonstrate that Efb blocks phagocytosis in plasma and in human whole blood. Using a mouse peritonitis model we show that Efb effectively blocks phagocytosis in vivo, either as a purified protein or when produced endogenously by S. aureus. Mutational analysis revealed that Efb requires both its fibrinogen and complement binding residues for phagocytic escape. Using confocal and transmission electron microscopy we show that Efb attracts fibrinogen {{to the surface of}} complement-labeled S. aureus generating a ‘capsule’-like shield. This thick layer of fibrinogen shields both surface-bound C 3 b and antibodies from recognition by phagocytic receptors.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is {{a highly}} versatile, {{opportunistic}} pathogen and the etiological agent {{of a wide range}} of infections in humans and warm-blooded animals. The epithelial surface is its principal site of colonization and infection. In this work, we investigated the cytopathic effect of S. aureus strains from human and animal origins and their ability to affect the host cell cycle in human HeLa and bovine MAC-T epithelial cell lines. S. aureus invasion slowed down cell proliferation and induced a cytopathic effect, resulting in the enlargement of host cells. A dramatic decrease in the number of mitotic cells was observed in the infected cultures. Flow cytometry analysis revealed an S. aureus-induced delay in the G 2 /M phase transition in synchronous HeLa cells. This delay required the presence of live S. aureus since the addition of the heat-killed bacteria did not alter the cell cycle. The results of Western blot experiments showed that the G 2 /M transition delay was associated with the accumulation of inactive cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk 1, a key inducer of mitosis entry, and with the accumulation of unphosphorylated histone H 3, which was correlated with a reduction of the mitotic cell number.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine if S. aureus colonization is a useful proxy measure to study disease transmission and infection in community settings, and to identify potential community reservoirs. Methodology/Principal Findings: Randomly selected households in Northern Manhattan, completed a structured social network questionnaire and provided nasal swabs that were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis to identify S. aureus colonizing strains. The main outcome measures were: 1) colonization with S. aureus; and 2) recent serious skin infection. Risk factor analyses were conducted at both the individual and the household levels; logistic regression models identified independent risks for household colonization and infection. Results: 321 surveyed households contained 914 members. The S. aureus prevalence was 25 % and MRSA was 0. 4 %. More than 40 % of households were colonized. Recent antibiotic use was the only significant correlate for household colonization (p =. 002). Seventy-eight (24 %) households reported serious skin infection.

Lipoate metabolism {{has been linked to}} pathogenesis in some microbial species, but its role in Staphylococcus aureus infections had not been explored. In this thesis, we tested the hypothesis that lipoate acquisition mechanisms promote S. aureus infectivity. We used a bacterial genetics approach to elucidate the biological function of the S. aureus genes involved in lipoate metabolism. Our findings allowed us to propose a model for lipoic acid de novo biosynthesis and salvage pathways in S. aureus. Moreover, we detail hitherto undescribed genetic arrangements of lipoate de novo biosynthesis and salvage genes in the S. aureus genome, which suggest a potential role for lipoate acquisition mechanisms in metabolic regulation and oxidative stress defense. Also, we have identified critical requirements for gene products involved in lipoate metabolism in murine sepsis. Our data indicate that S. aureus is capable of using bacterial and host-derived lipoate during infection in a tissue-specific manner, thereby promoting survival in diverse nutrient-restricted environments.

To colonize a host, S. aureus must resist bacteriocins produced by commensal bacteria. In a comprehensive analysis using individual TCS inactivation mutants, the inactivation of two TCSs, graRS and braRS, significantly increased the susceptibility to the class I bacteriocins, nukacin ISK- 1 and nisin A, and inactivation of vraSR slightly increased the susceptibility to nukacin ISK- 1. In addition, two ABC transporters (BraAB and VraDE) regulated by BraRS and one transporter (VraFG) regulated by GraRS were associated with resistance to nukacin ISK- 1 and nisin A. We investigated the role of these three TCSs of S. aureus in co-culture with S. warneri, which produces nukacin ISK- 1, and Lactococcus lactis, which produces nisin A.

Univariate analysis showed significant association between S. aureus genes/gene-clusters or clonal complexes and clinical endpoints. For example CC 15 was associated with 30 -day mortality and CC 22 with osteoarticular infection. In multivariate analysis methicillin resistance (mecA, OR 4. 8 [1. 43 – 16. 06]) and the beta-lactamase-gene (bla, OR 3. 12 [1. 17 – 8. 30]) remained independently associated with 30 -day mortality.

Determination of oxacillin MICs evaluated according to the new breakpoint (0. 5 g/ml) of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards exhibited an extremely low specificity for this population. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are major noso-comial pathogens (10, 12, 18, 22, 24), and treatment of infec-tions caused by CoNS is increasingly problematic due to the frequent occurrence of isolates resistant to multiple antibiotics (2). The majority of clinical CoNS harbor the mecA gene, which encodes an additional penicillin-binding protein (PBP), PBP 2 a, essential for expression of methicillin resistance (3). Phe-notypic {{detection of}} methicillin resistance in CoNS is difficult due to the heterogeneous expression of mecA (6, 16, 21, 27). mecA detection by PCR is very sensitive but is not feasible for the busy clinical microbiology laboratory. Thus, rapid, sensitive, and specific procedures for the detec-tion of methicillin resistance in CoNS are urgently needed.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is {{isolated}} from {{a substantial number}} of patients with infective endocarditis who are not known to have predisposing heart abnormalities. It has been suggested that the infection is initiated by the direct binding of S. aureus to human vascular endothelium. To determine the mutual response of the endothelial cells and the bacteria, we studied the interaction between S. aureus and human vascular endothelium. Scanning electron microscopic analyses showed that binding of S. aureus to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) mainly occurred via thread-like protrusions extending from the cell surface. Bound bacteria appeared to be internalized via retraction of the protrusions into newly formed invaginations of the endothelial cell surface. The growth phase of S. aureus had a major impact on the interaction with HUVEC. Logarithmically growing bacteria showed increased binding to, and were more readily internalized by, HUVEC compared to stationary-phase bacteria. To assess the bacterial response to the cellular environment, an expression library of S. aureus was used to identify genes whose expression was induced after 4 h of exposure to HUVEC. The identified genes could be divided into different categories based on the functions of the encoded proteins (transport, catabolism, biosynthesis, and DNA repair). Further analyses of five of the S. aureus transposon clones showed that HUVEC as well as human serum are stimuli for triggering gene expression in <b>S.</b> <b>aureu...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives Staphylococcus aureus is {{a notorious}} {{bacterial}} pathogen and antibiotic-resistant isolates complicate current treatment strategies. We characterized S. aureus VC 40, a laboratory mutant that shows full resistance to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin MICs ≥ 32 mg/L) and daptomycin (MIC =  4 mg/L), to gain deeper {{insights into the}} underlying resistance mechanisms. Methods Genomics and transcriptomics were performed to characterize changes that might contribute to development of resistance. The mutations in vraS were reconstituted into a closely related parental background. In addition, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, growth analyses, transmission electron microscopy, lysostaphin-induced lysis and autolysis assays were performed to characterize the phenotype of resistant strains. Results Genome sequencing of strain VC 40 revealed 79 mutations in 75 gene loci including genes encoding the histidine kinases VraS and WalK that control cell envelope-related processes. Transcriptomics indicated the increased expression of their respective regulons. Although not reaching the measured MIC for VC 40, reconstitution of the L 114 S and D 242 G exchanges in VraS(VC 40) into the susceptible parental background (S. aureus NCTC 8325) resulted in increased resistance to glycopeptides and daptomycin. The expression of VraS(VC 40) led to increased transcription of the cell wall stress stimulon, a thickened cell wall, a decreased growth rate, reduced autolytic activity and increased resistance to lysostaphin-induced lysis in the generated mutant. Conclusions We show that a double mutation of a single gene locus, namely vraS, is sufficient to convert the vancomycin-susceptible strain S. aureus NCTC 8325 into a vancomycin-intermediate <b>S.</b> <b>aureu...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background. Few data {{exist on}} the {{incidence}} and risk factors of Staphylococcus aureus colonization and skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Methods. Over a 2 -year period, we prospectively evaluated adults infected with HIV for incident S aureus col-onization at 5 body sites and SSTIs. Cox proportional hazard models using time-updated covariates were performed. Results. Three hundred twenty-two participants had a median age of 42 years (interquartile range, 32 – 49), an HIV duration of 9. 4 years (2. 7 – 17. 4), and 58 % were on {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART). Overall, 102 patients (32 %) became colonized with S aureus with an incidence rate of 20. 6 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 16. 8 – 25. 0) per 100 person-years [PYs]. Predictors of colonization in the final multivariable model included illicit drug use (hazard ratios [HR], 4. 26; 95 % CI, 1. 33 – 13. 69) and public gym use (HR 1. 66, 95 % CI, 1. 04 – 2. 66), whereas antibac-terial soap use was protective (HR, 0. 50; 95 % CI, 0. 32 – 0. 78). In a separate model, perigenital colonization was as-sociated with recent syphilis infection (HR, 4. 63; 95 % CI, 1. 01 – 21. 42). Fifteen percent of participants developed an SSTI (incidence rate of 9. 4 cases [95 % CI, 6. 8 – 12. 7] per 100 PYs). Risk factors for an SSTI included incident <b>S</b> <b>aureu...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{assess the}} way {{healthcare}} facilities (HCFs) diagnose, survey, and control methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Design: Questionnaire. Setting: Ninety HCFs in 30 countries. Results: Evaluation of susceptibility testing methods showed that 8 laboratories (9 %) used oxacillin disks with antimicrobial content {{different from the}} one recommended, 12 (13 %) did not determine MRSA susceptibility to vancomycin, and 4 (4. 5 %) reported instances of isolation of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus but neither confirmed this resistance nor alerted public health authorities. A MRSA control program was reported by 55 (61. 1 %) of the HCFs. The following isolation precautions were routinely used: hospitalization in a private room (34. 4 %), wearing of gloves (62. 2 %), wearing of gowns (44. 4 %), hand washing by healthcare workers (53. 3 %), use of an isolation sign on the patient's door (43 %), or all four. When the characteristics of HCFs with low incidence rates (< 0. 4 per 1, 000 patient-days) were compared with those of HCFs with high incidence rates (P = 0. 4 per 1, 000 patient-days), having a higher mean number of beds per infection control nurse was the only factor significantly associated with HCFs with high incidence rates (834 vs 318 beds; P =. 02). Conclusion: Our results emphasize the urgent need to strengthen the microbiologic and epidemiologic capacities of HCFs worldwide to prevent MRSA transmission and to prepare them to address the possible emergence of vancomycin-resistant <b>S.</b> <b>aureu...</b>|$|E
40|$|The agr quorum-sensing {{system of}} Staphylococcus aureus modulates the {{expression}} of virulence factors in response to autoinducing peptides (AIPs). Recent studies have suggested a role for the agr system in S. aureus biofilm development, as agr mutants exhibit a high propensity to form biofilms, and cells dispersing from a biofilm have been observed displaying an active agr system. Here, we report that repression of agr is necessary to form a biofilm and that reactivation of agr in established biofilms through AIP addition or glucose depletion triggers detachment. Inhibitory AIP molecules did not induce detachment and an agr mutant was non-responsive, indicating a dependence on a functional, active agr system for dispersal. Biofilm detachment occurred in multiple S. aureus strains possessing divergent agr systems, suggesting it is a general S. aureus phenomenon. Importantly, detachment also restored sensitivity of the dispersed cells to the antibiotic rifampicin. Proteinase K inhibited biofilm formation and dispersed established biofilms, suggesting agr-mediated detachment occurred in an ica-independent manner. Consistent with a protease-mediated mechanism, increased levels of serine proteases were detected in detaching biofilm effluents, and the serine protease inhibitor PMSF reduced the degree of agr-mediated detachment. Through genetic analysis, a double mutant in the agr-regulated Aur metalloprotease and the SplABCDEF serine proteases displayed minimal extracellular protease activity, improved biofilm formation, and a strongly attenuated detachment phenotype. These findings indicate that induction of the agr system in established <b>S.</b> <b>aureu...</b>|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus gyrA and gyrB genes {{encoding}} DNA gyrase subunits were cloned and coexpressed in Escherichia coli {{under the}} control of the T 7 promoter–T 7 RNA polymerase system, leading to soluble gyrase which was purified to homogeneity. Purified gyrase was catalytically indistinguishable from the gyrase purified from S. aureus and did not contain detectable amounts of topoisomerases from the E. coli host. Topoisomerase IV subunits GrlA and GrlB from S. aureus were also expressed in E. coli and were separately purified to apparent homogeneity. Topoisomerase IV, which was reconstituted by mixing equimolar amounts of GrlA and GrlB, had both ATP-dependent decatenation and DNA relaxation activities in vitro. This enzyme was more sensitive than gyrase to inhibition by typical fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents such as ciprofloxacin or sparfloxacin, adding strong support to genetic studies which indicate that topoisomerase IV is the primary target of fluoroquinolones in S. aureus. The results obtained with ofloxacin suggest that this fluoroquinolone could also primarily target gyrase. No cleavable complex could be detected with S. aureus gyrase upon incubation with ciprofloxacin or sparfloxacin at concentrations which fully inhibit DNA supercoiling. This suggests that these drugs do not stabilize the open DNA-gyrase complex, at least under standard in vitro incubation conditions, but are more likely to interfere primarily with the DNA breakage step, contrary to what has been reported with E. coli gyrase.

Specifically, receiving mechanical ventilation for over 24 hours {{increases the risk of}} VAP and is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and medical costs. Cost-effective endotracheal tubes (ETTs) that are resistant to bacterial infections could help prevent this problem. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine differences in the growth of Staphylococcus aureus on nanomodified and unmodified polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ETTs under dynamic airway conditions simulating a ventilated patient. PVC ETTs were modified to have nanometer surface features by soaking them in Rhizopus arrhisus, a fungal lipase. Twenty-four-hour experiments (supported by computational models) showed that airflow conditions within the ETT influenced both the location and the concentration of bacterial growth on the ETTs, especially within areas of tube curvature. More importantly, experiments revealed a 1. 5 log reduction in the total number of S. aureus on the novel nanomodified ETTs compared with the conventional ETTs after 24 hours of airflow. This dynamic study showed that lipase etching can create nanorough surface features on PVC ETTs that suppress S. aureus growth, and thus may provide clinicians with an effective and inexpensive tool to combat VAP.
