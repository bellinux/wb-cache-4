The distinguishing feature of this laboratory apparatus is that it can simulate triaxial condition of <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>compaction</b> grouting. The effective confining pressure, the lateral pressure coefficient, excess pore water pressure, back pressure and void ratio change of the specimen were measured in this study.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new <b>static</b> test set <b>compaction</b> method {{based on a}} careful {{examination}} of attributes of fault coverage curves. Our method is based on two key ideas: (1) fault-list and testset partitioning, and (2) vector re-ordering. Typically, the first few vectors of a test set detect {{a large number of}} faults. The remaining vectors usually constitute a large fraction of the test set, but these vectors are included to detect relatively few hard faults. We show that significant compaction can be achieved by partitioning faults into hard and easy faults. This significantly reduces the computational cost for <b>static</b> test set <b>compaction</b> without affecting quality of compaction. The second technique re-orders vectors in a test set by moving sequences that detect hard faults {{to the beginning of the}} test set.

40|$|Excessive {{switching}} {{activity during}} scan testing can cause average power dissipation and peak power during test {{to be much}} higher than during normal operation. This can cause problems both with heat dissipation and with current spikes. Compacting scan vectors greatly increases the power dissipation for the vectors (generally the power becomes several times greater). The compacted scan vectors often can exceed the power constraints and hence cannot be used. It is shown here that by carefully selecting {{the order in which}} pairs of test cubes are merged during <b>static</b> <b>compaction,</b> both average power and peak power for the final test set can be greatly reduced. A <b>static</b> <b>compaction</b> procedure is presented {{that can be used to}} find a minimal set of scan vectors that satisfies constraints on both average power and peak power.

The influence of rubber particle content on mechanical properties of samples was studied by compaction tests and freezing thawing recycle tests. Pore structure and fractal characteristic of mixture were analyzed quantitatively using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was adopted to identify the composition phases. The morphology analysis in micro scale and elemental analysis of samples were carried out by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The optimum compressive strengths of rubber cement stabilized gravel (RCSG) with <b>static</b> <b>compaction</b> method and with vibratory compaction method were obtained by controlling compaction degree and vibration time, respectively. From the compaction tests, the vibratory compaction method is preferred compared with the <b>static</b> <b>compaction</b> method as better compressive strength can be improved by about 340 %- 360 %. Besides, test results also reveal that compressive strength of samples with vibratory compaction method or <b>static</b> <b>compaction</b> method will decrease with the rubber particle bulk content increasing. The freezing thawing recycle tests indicate that freezing thawing resistance has been improved (frozen stability coefficient K has been increased from 0. 89 to 0. 97) by the addition of rubber particles. MIP tests show that the mean pore diameter and porosity of mixture have been increased from 70 to 250 nm and 9 % to 24 % respectively, with the rubber particles content increasing.

Experiments were performed in the partial compaction region to nearly full compaction. The effects of variables including initial density, particle size distribution, particle morphology, and loading path were investigated in the static experiments. Only particle morphology was found to significantly affect the compaction response. Post-test examination of the powder reveals fracture of the grains as well as breaking at particle edges. In dynamic experiments, steady structured compaction waves traveling at very low velocities were observed. The strain rate within the compaction waves was found to scale nearly linearly with the shock stress, in contrast with many fully dense materials where strain rate scales with stress to the fourth power. Similar scaling is found for data from the literature on TiO 2 powder. The dynamic response of WC powder {{is found to be}} significantly stiffer than the static response, probably because deformation in the dynamic case is confined to the relatively narrow compaction wave front.

40|$|Determination of {{strength}} parameters of a soil sample is {{highly dependent on}} the soil density and its variability across the sample. Triaxial test or unconfined compression strength test on clay soils is often undertaken on consolidated samples prepared from slurry, or remoulded samples either by <b>static</b> <b>compaction</b> in single layer or dynamic compaction in multi layers. Preparation of clay soil samples using <b>static</b> <b>compaction</b> usually provides samples with predetermined target density. However, ensuring that the density is identical across the height of sample is often not investigated and/or ignored. The strength of fibre reinforced clay soil samples (as composite sample) suffers significantly from variation of fibre content and density across the sample due to inconsistency between soil and fibre phases. The results of the preliminary investigation on clay soil samples prepared by <b>static</b> <b>compaction</b> method indicated that the density is higher in {{the upper part of}} clay soil sample which is in contact with moving rammer. However the lower part of sample would receive less compaction and produces less density than what is expected. In this study three different methods have been examined to improve the uniformity of density in different sections of the prepared fibre reinforced clay soil samples. For each method several samples have been prepared. Unconfined compression strength test was also conducted on half of the prepared samples while the rest of samples were used to examine the variability of density, moisture content and fibre content in different sections along the sample height.

40|$|We {{consider}} two topics {{related to}} testing of synchronous sequential circuits. The first topic deals with synchronizable circuits and their synchronizing sequences.

We show a class of faults for which a synchronizing sequence for the faulty circuit can be easily determined from the synchronizing sequence of the fault free circuit. We also consider circuits that have a reset mechanism, and show how reset can ensure that no single fault would cause the circuit to become unsynchronizable.

Several dynamic algorithms for compaction in combinational circuits {{have been proposed}} but, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, no dynamic method has been reported in the literature for compaction in non scan sequential circuits.

If all bottlenecks of a sequence are eliminated, then the sequence is dropped from the test set. The final test set generated by our algorithm is minimal in the following sense. <b>Static</b> vector <b>compaction</b> or test cycle reduction using set-covering or extended set-covering approaches (for example, reverse or any other order of fault simulation, with any specification of unspecified inputs in test sequences) cannot further reduce the number of vectors.

40|$|The test {{application}} {{time of a}} scan circuit is {{a significant factor in}} the overall test cost of the circuit. Therefore, reducing the test {{application time}} is an important problem. The test application time of a test set for a scan circuit is determined by the sum of the number of scan shifts required for applying the test set, and the number of primary input vectors in the test set. Compaction procedures that view a full scan circuit as a combinational circuit reduce the number of test vectors, where a test vector consists of a scan vector and a primary input vector. This is not sufficient since for large scale circuits the high test application time {{is a result of the}} number of scan operations (or scan vectors) rather than the number of primary input vectors. Therefore, effective procedures must reduce the number of scan operations further than the combinational circuit view allows. Procedures to reduce the test application time by dropping scan operations have been proposed earlier. The compaction procedures proposed in this research reduce the test application time further by using limited scan operations. Under a limited scan operation, the number of shifts is smaller than the length of a scan chain. <b>Static</b> <b>compaction</b> procedures and dynamic compaction procedures which use limited scan operations are proposed.
