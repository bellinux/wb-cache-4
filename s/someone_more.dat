5|$|On November 10, 1978, 10 {{months after}} being sworn in, White {{resigned}} {{his position on}} the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, saying that his annual salary of $9,600 was not enough to support his family. Within days, White requested that his resignation be withdrawn and he be reinstated, and Mayor Moscone initially agreed. However, further consideration—and intervention by other supervisors—convinced Moscone to appoint <b>someone</b> <b>more</b> in line with the growing ethnic diversity of White's district and the liberal leanings of the Board of Supervisors.|$|E
5|$|The Scilly naval {{disaster}} of 1707, {{in which a}} fleet commanded by Sir Cloudesley Shovell foundered, highlighted mismanagement at the Admiralty, for which George was nominally responsible. Pressure grew to replace Admiral Churchill with <b>someone</b> <b>more</b> dynamic. By October 1708, five powerful politicians, known as the Whig Junto—Lords Somers, Halifax, Orford, Wharton and Sunderland—were clamouring {{for the removal of}} both Prince George and Churchill. Marlborough wrote to his brother telling him to resign, but Churchill refused, protected by Prince George.|$|E
5|$|This {{still left}} {{the problem of}} getting {{government}} support for uranium research. Another friend of Szilárd's, the Austrian economist Gustav Stolper, suggested approaching Alexander Sachs, who had access to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sachs told Szilárd that he had already spoken to the President about uranium, but that Fermi and Pegram had reported that the prospects for building an atomic bomb were remote. He told Szilárd that he would deliver the letter, but suggested that it come from <b>someone</b> <b>more</b> prestigious. For Szilárd, Einstein was again the obvious choice. Sachs and Szilárd drafted a letter riddled with spelling errors and mailed it to Einstein.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} in the Senate, he {{returned}} to Henderson and resumed his law practice. He was a delegate to the Union National Convention in 1866. In 1867, he was again nominated to the U.S. Senate, but after several ballots over several months, the General Assembly had not elected him. Powell believed {{that many of the}} legislators had been elected as a result of election interference by Northern forces, and that their intent was to prevent Kentucky from electing a senator at all, diminishing her influence nationally. In light of this belief, he urged the Democrats to withdraw his name and nominate <b>someone</b> <b>more</b> palatable to Union sympathizers. This they did, putting forth the name of Garrett Davis, who was subsequently elected.|$|E

According to Suetonius, when Domitius was congratulated by his friends {{for the birth of}} his son he replied that any child born to him and Agrippina would have a detestable nature and become a public danger, a fact that became true during the second part of Nero's reign. When Nero castrated a boy named Sporus and married him as a wife, Suetonius quoted one Roman who lived around this time who remarked that the world {{would have been better off}} if Nero's father had married <b>someone</b> <b>more</b> like the castrated boy.|$|E

Once she acquires her dream dress, Elle goes to dinner with Warner, where he tells her that he needs <b>someone</b> <b>more</b> serious and breaks up with her ("Serious"). Elle is devastated and sulks for twelve days ("Daughter Of Delta Nu") but decides to chase Warner to Harvard Law School to show him that she can be serious. With help from Delta Nu sister Kate, Elle studies for the LSAT. Instead of writing a personal essay, Elle bursts into the Harvard admission offices backed by a squad of cheerleaders.

500|$|After seeing men {{working on}} an open {{escalator}} in a mall around Christmas time, Glen Morgan decided to revisit the character of Eugene Victor Tooms, from the first episode he and co-writer James Wong wrote for the series, [...] "Squeeze". [...] "Tooms" [...] introduced the character of Walter Skinner, although this would be his only appearance in the first season. The character had been conceived as playing against the stereotypical bureaucratic [...] "paper-pusher", being instead <b>someone</b> <b>more</b> [...] "quietly dynamic".|$|E
500|$|The judging panel, {{headed by}} Calcedonio Ferrari, ruled {{following}} a swift deliberation that Feletti should be released {{as he had}} acted under instructions from {{the government of the}} time. The interval between the priest's arrest and his trial, coupled with the swift progress being made towards Italian unification, meant that the Mortara case had lost much of its prominence, so there was little protest against the decision. The Jewish press expressed disappointment—an editorial in the Italian Jewish paper L'Educatore israelitico suggested that it had perhaps been unwise to target Feletti rather than <b>someone</b> <b>more</b> senior. In France Archives Israélites took a similar line, positing: [...] "what good does it do to strike at the arm when it is the head that in this case conceived, carried out, and sanctioned the attack?" ...|$|E

500|$|Vice President Henry Wallace {{was popular}} among Democratic voters, {{but he was}} viewed as {{too far to the}} left and too {{friendly}} to labor for some of Roosevelt's advisers. The President and several of his confidantes wanted to replace Wallace with <b>someone</b> <b>more</b> acceptable to Democratic Party leaders and Roosevelt's advisors, knowing that Roosevelt might not live out a fourth term. Outgoing Democratic National Committee chairman Frank C. Walker, incoming chairman Hannegan, party treasurer Edwin W. Pauley, strategist Ed Flynn, Chicago Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly, and lobbyist George E. Allen all wanted to keep Wallace off the ticket. Roosevelt told party leaders that he would accept either Truman or Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. State and city party leaders strongly preferred Truman, and Roosevelt agreed. Truman did not campaign for the Vice-Presidential spot, though he welcomed the attention as evidence that he had become more than the [...] "Senator from Pendergast".|$|E
500|$|Catesby {{and fellow}} {{conspirator}}s Thomas Percy, John Wright {{and his brother}} Christopher {{were killed by the}} Sheriff of Worcester's men early on 8 November, but Digby had already left to give himself up (the only conspirator to do so). [...] With two servants, possibly Bates and his son, he took several horses and hid in nearby woods. [...] Their tracks were soon found however, and with some hesitation (Digby had intended to surrender himself to <b>someone</b> <b>more</b> worthy), early that morning he presented himself to the most senior-looking of his adversaries. [...] While Digby was taken to the Tower of London, Gayhurst was ransacked; the servants' belongings were stolen, the livestock was sold cheaply, and Mary Digby was left destitute. [...] The sheriff later remarked [...] "All goods are carried away, even to the very floor of the great parlour." [...] At the Tower, Digby's two trunks of clothing were searched, and found to contain £100 in gold, and £50 in white money. [...] William Waad, Lieutenant of the Tower, asked if he could take £50 to pay for Digby's food and bedding.|$|E
500|$|... "Tooms" [...] {{introduced}} {{the character of}} Walter Skinner, although this would be his only appearance in the first season. The character had been conceived as playing against the stereotypical bureaucratic [...] "paper-pusher", being instead <b>someone</b> <b>more</b> [...] "quietly dynamic". Actor Mitch Pileggi had auditioned unsuccessfully for several other parts on the series before being cast as Skinner. At first, {{the fact that he}} was asked back to audition for the role had puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not cast for the previous parts—Chris Carter had been unable to imagine Pileggi as any of those characters, due to the fact that the actor had been shaving his head. When Pileggi attended the audition for Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow back. Pileggi's attitude fit well with the character of Skinner, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. After successfully auditioning for the role, Pileggi thought he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed the opportunity to play the recurring role of Skinner.|$|E

500|$|Blakeman {{said that}} she read the book in a single sitting, before [...] "crying her eyes out".

For Blakeman, April's [...] "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." [...] Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke {{of the limits of}} taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's [...] "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. And that is an amazing liberation when you discover <b>someone</b> <b>more</b> important to you than you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent – you care about your child more than you care about yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{review in}} the New York Times noted that the basic premise is a good idea, but [...] "studded {{as it is with}} undigested chunks of {{scientific}} jargon, sociology-speak and polemical rhetoric Batman: The Ultimate Evil misses out almost completely on the pure pulp thrills that {{lie at the heart of}} its title character's appeal." [...] In the St. Petersburg Times, Adam Begley also noted the use of what he called [...] "techno-babble". In The Washington Post, Jack Womack wrote that Vachss describes the Batmobile [...] "lovingly yet gnomically, as if a Motor Trend review had been translated into Slovakian by <b>someone</b> <b>more</b> familiar with Czech" [...] and concluded that the novel was [...] "as satisfying — aesthetically, ethically, morally — as a pulse-pounding yarn in which pulp-fiction hero Doc Savage ransacks the shantytowns of South America in a terribly successful search for Doc Mengele." [...] In Kirkus Reviews, the story was compared to a generic [...] "Destroy All Exploiters" [...] video game where Batman [...] "disposes of each lower-level pimp, then moves up to the next level". Sybil Steinberg in Publishers Weekly noted that [...] "while no classic, this is likely the [...] most stylish adaptation yet of a comic-book figure, its cold stiletto prose and white-hot passions lifting it leagues above recent Spider-man and Incredible Hulk offerings. It's also Vachss' best work since Shella". [...] Both the Library Journal and Booklist predicted heavy demand for it at public libraries.|$|E
