50|$|B. Cohen & Co. {{pioneered the}} use of these {{synthetic}} fabrics as lining materials and took the market by storm as expensive silk was substituted for these new fabrics. By the 1950s, B. Cohen & Co. along with Collins and Cawthorn, were the foremost merchant converters in Europe, with ranges of lining fabrics woven and dyed to their own specification. The major supplier of loom state fabric to both companies was Carrington & Dewhurst of Eccleston near Chorley; who were also innovators in the production of cellulosic and synthetic fibres. These complex fabrics were dyed by Thomas Robinson, a traditional northern dye house owned by B. Cohen & Co at Ramsbottom, Lancashire. Thomas Robinson with the help of ICI had developed nylon and polyester and then futuristic <b>spun</b> <b>fabric</b> blends of viscose and acetate. With their fine silk handle and vibrant colour these fabrics proved to be ideal for lining garments. It is estimated that around 1,700,000,000 garments were made with linings sold under the brand name Morada.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The garment {{stretch and}} {{recovery}} characteristics due to body movements can be indirectly assessed by the dynamic elastic recovery (DER) value of the fabrics at different extension levels. In order to study DER of elastic fabrics, a comparative analysis was made between spandex-plated cotton fabric and spandex core cotton spun (SCCS) fabric. It {{was found that the}} spandex-plated cotton fabric has higher DER value than that of SCCS fabric. The results of this study show that this phenomenon is due to the residual energy of the elastane unraveled from these fabrics. The stress values of these fabrics have no significant effect at 95 % confidence level. It is concluded that the spandex-plated cotton fabric is suitable than SCCS fabric, for the tight fit garments meant for the sports like Javelin, shot-put, and athletics.

In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} different concentrations of aramid sta-ple fibers on the mechanical properties of wool/PET/aramid blended <b>spun</b> yarn and <b>fabric.</b> Three different fiber com-positions were used to produce aramid fabrics with aramid fiber contents of 0 − 10 %. We measured the mechanical properties of these aramid blended fabrics: the tensile strength, wear strength, and fastness against washing, friction, and daylight. The tensile test results demonstrated that the mechanical properties of the aramid blended fabric change with the amount of aramid staple fibers. In particular, 6 % aramid blended fabrics showed the best physical properties, but higher aramid concentrations produced no further changes. One reason could be the decrease in mechanical prop-erties due to the low cohesion stress of individual aramid fibers. In conclusion, a woven fabric made of 3 − 6 % arami...|$|R

40|$|A {{non-woven}} capillary matting fabric (Tex-R® Pro), {{coated with}} a latex polymer-based formulation of cupric hydroxide (Spin Out®), developed to cover standing-out areas for weed control and to prevent rooting through, was assessed for its potential to reduce the spread of Phytophthora root rot in container-grown hardy nursery-stock. As well as production bed covers, the fabric was cut into discs and (a) used to cover the tops of plant containers (pot toppers) and (b) inserted to cover {{the holes in the}} bottoms of plant containers (disc inserts). These were all tested as barriers to the passage of infective zoospores of Phytophthora cryptogea in enclosed re-circulating irrigation systems growing test plants of Chamaecyparis lawsoniana. Bed covers and disc inserts significantly reduced disease spread, as indicated by the incidence of symptoms and infection, and by bait and colony-forming unit tests of re-circulating water, both in overhead- and trickle-irrigated systems. Pot toppers were not effective. This may be explained by the mode of spread of Phytophthora in such irrigation systems, which appears to be largely via capillary water and therefore not intercepted by toppers. These results were supported by in vitro studies on the passage of zoospores through fresh and used fabric samples which showed that all Tex-R Pro fabric materials significantly reduced the survival of zoospores and zoospore cysts (to between 0 % and 4. 8 %) compared with untreated fabrics (between 32. 3 % and 42. 8 %). Analysis of Cu 2 + concentrations in re-circulating irrigation water and in matting samples {{at the end of the}} field experiments showed that the majority of the active ingredient stayed bound to the fabric.
