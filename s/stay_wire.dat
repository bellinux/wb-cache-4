40|$|This is a Theoretical and {{experimental}} investigation concerning {{the reduction of}} the insulation distance of distribution lines, when a <b>stay</b> <b>wire</b> (a steel wire that supports the pole of the distribution network) is heated by a ground fire. It has been experimentally proved that a ground fire can drastically reduce the mechanical strength of the <b>stay</b> <b>wire,</b> to a point where wire breakage can be caused even from a small ground fire resulting from dead wood and small bushes near the wire. Theoretical results lead {{to the conclusion that the}} fire causes a permanent expansion of the wire, which results in the loosening of the bare conductors and {{the reduction of the}} insulation distance. © 2009 The Institution of Engineering and Technology...|$|E

50|$|TCU {{has a small}} {{commercial}} strip {{located along}} University and Berry Streets, which feature a number of popular venues {{within walking distance of}} the campus. Fuzzy's Tacos, Perotti's Pizza, and Dutch's Hamburgers (named after longtime TCU football coach Dutch Meyer) are favorite student venues for lunch and dinner. Popular bars within walking distance include The Pub and The Aardvark, the latter of which hosts live music performances Thursday through Saturday. The nearby coffee shop, <b>Stay</b> <b>Wired,</b> is also popular among students for its rotating exhibits of local artists, its computer repair and technology services, and the open-mic night it hosts on Thursdays. <b>Stay</b> <b>Wired</b> is also known for staying open 24/7 during finals week.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{official}} documents {{the cause of}} death was [...] "drowning" [...] although his body was injured in the impact. The official cause of the crash was attributed to [...] "fracture of one of the wing <b>stay</b> <b>wires</b> when running into a gust of wind".|$|R

5000|$|The rig is a sloop, but {{the forward}} <b>stay</b> (the <b>wire</b> from mast to bow) only reaches {{to a place}} 7/8s up the mast. This makes the mast better-braced, and the boat less top-heavy than a {{standard}} sloop. It also makes the boat {{far more likely to}} point into the wind.|$|R
50|$|Of his experiment, Beck wrote:The set {{used was}} a rough, {{makeshift}} affair, weighing thirty-two pounds. It {{consisted of a}} small spark-gap and interrupter, an ordinary telegraph-key, a small storage cell and a by-path or shunt to prevent overcharging the cell. All of these were combined in a wooden box which was carried on my lap. For aerial we used one hundred and twenty feet of phosphor-bronze wire, stranded, dependent from {{the tail of the}} aeroplane and connected with the sending apparatus by a number sixteen copper insulated wire. For conductive ground we simply connected {{the other side of the}} sending apparatus to one of the <b>stay</b> <b>wires</b> of the aeroplane. It took us about ten minutes to fit the outfit to the aeroplane. The wave-length measured by the wave-meter at the receiving station was 575 meters in length. This is rather longer than we had thought it would be.|$|R

5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600–700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The <b>stay</b> <b>wires</b> were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, {{he was forced to}} leap from the rope and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who had paid for tickets on the steamers, felt they had been scammed.|$|R
50|$|On December 14 in the Helmand {{province}} {{there was}} increased activity around British bases {{prior to the}} announcement of the operation.

60|$|Up and up {{went the}} biplane, {{guided by the}} steady hand and keen eye of Dick. The wind rushed over the canvas planes and sang merrily through the <b>wire</b> <b>stays.</b> The engine banged away steadily, and the {{propellers}} left only a blur {{in the air as}} they kept whizzing around and around.|$|R
60|$|Soon Dick {{was on the}} way, {{standing}} behind the biplane and using the long pole as best he could. He was in water up to his ankles and as the planks were slippery he had to watch his footing.

50|$|In {{earthquake}} prone areas (e.g., California) diagonal <b>wire</b> <b>stays</b> {{are often}} required by building codes {{in order to}} ensure the ceiling grid won't sway laterally during an earthquake, which can lead to partial or total collapse of the ceiling grid on the occupants below during a severe tremor. Compression posts may also be added to keep the ceiling from bouncing vertically during an earthquake.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stays</b> are ropes, <b>wires,</b> or rods on sailing {{vessels that}} run fore-and-aft along the {{centerline}} from the masts to the hull, deck, bowsprit, or to other masts which serve {{to stabilize the}} masts. On a ship with a single mast, stays that run aft are called backstays and stays that run forward are called forestays. Along with shrouds, they form the primary stabilization for the standing rigging.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} device {{used in the}} {{surgical}} correction of hammer toes is the K-wire. After bone has been removed and the toe has been re-aligned, the wire is inserted through the open end of the afflicted toe to hold the joint in place and stabilize it. The <b>wire</b> <b>stays</b> in place {{for up to six}} weeks during the healing process. K-wires can be painful, uncomfortable and prone to infection. Because the wound is open, K-wires can lead to [...] "pin tract" [...] infection requiring additional treatment and further complicating the recovery period.|$|R
50|$|Difficult to {{re-route}} - When {{compared to}} motorbuses, trolleybuses have greater difficulties with temporary or permanent re-routings, wiring for {{which is not}} usually readily available outside of downtown areas where the buses may be re-routed via adjacent business area streets where other trolleybus routes operate. This problem was highlighted in Vancouver in July 2008, when an explosion closed several roads in the city's downtown core. Because of the closure, trolleys were forced to detour several kilometers off their route in order to <b>stay</b> on the <b>wires,</b> leaving major portions of their routes not in service and off-schedule.|$|R
50|$|Qualitatively, at low {{frequencies}} and within limits, {{increasing the number}} of turns N improves Q because L varies as N2 while R varies linearly with N. Similarly, increasing the radius r of an inductor improves Q because L varies as r2 while R varies linearly with r. So high Q air core inductors often have large diameters and many turns. Both of those examples assume the diameter of the <b>wire</b> <b>stays</b> the same, so both examples use proportionally more wire (copper). If the total mass of wire is held constant, then there would be no advantage to {{increasing the number of}} turns or the radius of the turns because the wire would have to be proportionally thinner.|$|R
5000|$|The Wiegand {{interface}} uses three wires, one {{of which}} is a common ground and two of which are data transmission wires usually called DATA0 and DATA1, alternately labeled [...] "D0" [...] and [...] "D1" [...] or [...] "Data Low" [...] and [...] "Data High". When no data is being sent, both DATA0 and DATA1 are pulled up to the [...] "high" [...] voltage level — usually +5 VDC. When a 0 is sent the DATA0 wire is pulled to a low voltage while the DATA1 <b>wire</b> <b>stays</b> at a high voltage. When a 1 is sent the DATA1 wire is pulled to a low voltage while DATA0 stays at a high voltage.|$|R
5000|$|The Broomway was {{formerly}} {{marked by a}} series of markers resembling short-handled besoms or brooms, hence its name. The [...] "brooms" [...] were driven two feet into the sands, protruded about a foot above them, were positioned around 30 yards apart, and were <b>stayed</b> with <b>wire</b> shrouds. The author Herbert W. Tompkins, who walked the Broomway in the early 1900s, described how as the tide ebbed the brooms would [...] "lift their heads and appear as a line of black dots", providing an indication of when the traveller might start their journey. The [...] "brooms" [...] required regular maintenance and replacement due to the effects of tides and storms: since at least the 18th century, this had been funded by a regular payment split between the parish and the island's major landowner. The headways, at least in later years, were marked with fingerposts of the type then found on conventional roads, also driven into the sand. At night, when the [...] "brooms" [...] could be harder to spot, locals were accustomed to use the lights of the Nore, Mouse, and Swin lightvessels and the Maplin lighthouse to help judge their position.|$|R
50|$|Both {{aircraft}} {{were single}} bay biplanes with wings of rectangular plan mounted with strong stagger. Both {{upper and lower}} wings were one-piece, two spar structures. Normally such wings were braced together on each side {{by a pair of}} interplane struts, one between each of the two corresponding upper and lower spars and <b>stayed</b> by incidence <b>wires,</b> but the de Marçays had instead rigid interplane braces of parallelogram form. The upper wing was supported over the fuselage with two pairs of N-form cabane struts and the lower one passed under the fuselage and was joined to it by three short struts, two to the forward spar linked to the engine mounting and the other, centrally, to the rear. The wingspan and wing area of the Limousine were about 17% greater than that of the single seater.|$|R
60|$|The {{two boys}} walked {{to where the}} biplane had been put together, in a large open wagon shed {{attached}} {{to the rear of}} the big barn. The biplane has a stretch from side to side of over thirty feet, and the shed had been cleaned out from end to end to make room for it. There was a rudder in front and another behind, and in the centre was a broad cane seat, with a steering wheel, and several levers for controlling the craft. Back of the seat was the engine, lightly built but powerful, and above was a good-sized tank of gasoline. The framework of the biplane was of bamboo, held together by <b>stays</b> of piano <b>wire,</b> and the planes themselves were of canvas, especially prepared so as to be almost if not quite air proof. All told, the machine was a fine one, thoroughly up-to-date, and had cost considerable money.|$|R
5000|$|Cable is {{very strong}} in tensile strength, with a {{breaking}} strength in excess of 1000 lbs for these types of uses, and is a suitable in-fill material for a railing ("guard" [...] in ICC codes). Typical diameters are 1/8", 3/16" [...] for residential and 3/16" [...] and 1/4" [...] for commercial applications. [...] There are many different types cable and strand (also referred to as wire rope). Cable and strand is available in galvanized carbon steel, type 304 stainless steel, or the highly corrosion resistant, type 316 stainless steel (best for coastal areas). The most common cable construction is 1x19 type construction strand, which is 19 cables twisted in a single bundle, whereas for example, 7x7 would be 7 cable bundles of 7 cables twisted. This type of stainless strand is designed to have limited stretch, as compared to galvanized, making it a good long term cable railing solution. It has long been used for yacht <b>stays</b> and guy <b>wires,</b> proving its outdoor durability and strength.|$|R
60|$|Foot by foot {{he worked}} forward, and, {{stopping}} for some moments, {{tried to get}} up by the shrouds. He slipped back with only three fingers on the rail, and the risk he had run of letting go altogether unnerved him. He waited until he recovered, and then dragged himself forward, moving one hand over the other a few inches at a time. This was more difficult now, because as the boat’s sheerline rose sharply at the bows he was higher {{out of the water and}} there was a greater weight on his arms; but at last he clutched the bowsprit and hung on by it, splashing feebly as he felt for the <b>wire</b> <b>stay</b> with his feet. Now that he was almost in safety, terror seized him. He found the wire, slid his foot along it, and lifting himself to the bowsprit fell forward, limp and inert, on deck. He lay there for a minute, and then with an effort roused himself, realizing that if he remained much longer he would perish of exhaustion and cold.|$|R
40|$|Studies of Majorana bound {{states in}} {{semiconducting}} nanowires frequently neglect the orbital {{effect of a}} magnetic field. Systematically studying its role leads us to several conclusions for designing Majoranas in this system. Specifically, we show that for experimentally relevant parameter values the orbital effect of a magnetic field has a stronger impact on the dispersion relation than the Zeeman effect. While Majoranas do not require the presence of only one dispersion subband, we observe {{that the size of}} the Majoranas becomes unpractically large, and the band gap unpractically small, when more than one subband is filled. Since the orbital effect of a magnetic field breaks several symmetries of the Hamiltonian, it leads to the appearance of large regions in parameter space with no band gap whenever the magnetic field is not aligned with the wire axis. The reflection symmetry of the Hamiltonian with respect to the plane perpendicular to the wire axis guarantees that the <b>wire</b> <b>stays</b> gapped in the topologically nontrivial region as long as the field is aligned with the wire. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Lack {{of funds}} meant that little {{could be done}} to improve {{military}} aviation {{in the first years of}} the new state, although in 1922, Uzelac went on a European tour to study military aviation in foreign armies. Efforts were also made to develop a civil aviation sector with a view to forming a reserve pool of pilots and mechanics. The following year, Uzelac retired, and the British military attache noted that there were several former Russian Empire aviators serving in the air force, two of whom attempted to defect to the Soviet Union with an aircraft during that year. In 1924, the first Yugoslav-built aircraft was produced at the Ikarus plant in Novi Sad, albeit with a foreign-made engine. The next year, 150 Breguet 19 biplane light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft were purchased on credit from the French government, signalling the first significant expansion of the air force. The new aircraft were assembled at Novi Sad, then distributed to the other military aerodromes at Sarajevo, Mostar, Zagreb and Skopje. The Ikarus plant was producing training aircraft and seaplanes using Austrian engines captured at the end of World War I, and imported steel tubing and <b>wire</b> <b>stays.</b> [...] In 1926, the aerodrome at Zemun was developed in order to provide a military airfield near the capital, Belgrade, and a military air race was held for the first time, with a gold cup presented by King Alexander.|$|R
40|$|The Problem: Interconnect delays {{have become}} the major limit in VLSI system speeds today. For {{frequencies}} in and above the GHz range on chip, on-chip electrical interconnect bandwidthislimited by the DC resistance, skin effect (AC resistance), capacitance, and dielectric dispersion of wires. [1, 2]. Also, the inductance of long on-chip wires {{can no longer be}} ignored when switching frequencies are over several GHz. The speed of transistors in modern ICs increases substantially with every improving generation; however the raw, unbuffered speed of the electrical interconnect wiring is reaching a plateau, limited by material, electrical and geometry constraints. The intrinsic RC time constant of electrical <b>wires</b> <b>stays</b> approximately constant throughout process scaling; the l 2 dependence of the interconnect delay onthelength, l,oftheconnection does not go away for chips with smaller feature sizes. In fact, since today’s chips are becoming more complex, the average interconnect distance is actually increasing. While pipelining may seem like a simple solution to this problem, the latency penalty simply cannot be tolerated for some critical signals. As minimum wire widths and pitches decrease in moreadvancedtechnologies, wire heigths are increased to provide lower parasitic resistance, to increase current capacity and to reduce delays. However, this steep wire aspect ratio translates into greater mutual capacitance coupling between adjacent wires, increasing crosstalk noise. Simultaneous switching noise has also increased due to faster signalling rates and increased complexity of modern ICs. Power supply distribution for both on-chip and in chip packaging has also become a major design issue becaus...|$|R
5000|$|A Wire gauze is a {{sheet of}} thin metal that has net-like crosses or a wire mesh. Wire gauze {{is placed on the}} support ring that is {{attached}} to the retort stand between the Bunsen burner and the beakers in order to support the beakers or other glassware or flasks during heating. Moreover, the glassware has to be flat-bottomed to <b>stay</b> on the <b>wire</b> gauze. The wire gauze is made of a [...] This type of material provides long life expectancy and can be used over and over again without a risk of it being torn. The sides/corners of the wire gauze are turned inward to help prevent fraying, improve handling and reduce safety risk from protruding ends of wire. The wire gauze is an important piece of supporting equipment in a laboratory because beakers or any type of glassware cannot be heated directly with a flame from the Bunsen burner, and the wire gauze will help protect the glassware. There are two types of wire gauze: woven wire gauze and a wire gauze with a ceramic center. These two types of wire gauze that are made of metal have the same ability to transmit the heat efficiently, but the gauze with a ceramic center will allow the heat to be dispersed more evenly. The ceramic {{at the center of the}} wire gauze is enmeshed at high pressure to prevent it from peeling. There are three sizes of wire gauze with ceramic center: 4 inches, 5 inches, and 6 inches, so that different sizes of glassware can be accommodated.|$|R
40|$|Farmed blue foxes {{are willing}} to work for access to an earth floor. However, when the foxes have free access to earth and wire mesh floors they prefer the wire mesh floor, in {{particular}} while resting. Consequently, it seems that blue foxes are motivated to access an earth floor, but in some circumstances they may even consider the earth floor aversive. We compared the earth floor use in blue foxes working to leave an wire mesh floor to enter an earth floor and foxes working to leave the earth floor to enter the wire mesh floor. The subjects were 16 blue fox males in two cohorts of eight foxes. From the age of 12 weeks, the foxes were individually housed in test cages. Each test cage consisted of two traditional fox cages (115 × 105 × 70 cm, L×W×H), with two openings (23 × 28 cm, W×H) between the cages. The openings had one-way doors. The force needed to open the one-way doors could be altered. There was a wire mesh floor in one of the cages and an earth floor with a 30 cm layer of sand in the other cage. In four test cages of each cohort, door weight was altered in the door leading from the wire mesh to earth floor (TOEF), and in four test cages in the door leading from the earth to wire mesh floor (FROEF). After 10 days of training, the foxes were exposed three times to door weighs of 0, 0. 5, 1. 5 and 2. 5 kg. The door weights were changed after every 24 h. The number and duration of visits, and the percentage of time spent on the floor materials were measured. One FROEF fox was removed from the experiment. The data for 15 foxes were analysed using Linear Mixed Model analysis (SPSS). As expected, the number of visits decreased with increasing workload (p 0. 05). As the workload increased the percentage of time spent on the earth decreased in the TOEF (29 % on 0 kg weight to 15 % on 2. 5 kg weight), but increased in the FROEF (23 % on 0 kg to 50 % on 2. 5 kg) (p 0. 05) or group-workload interaction (p> 0. 05). The results confirm the earlier findings that blue foxes {{are willing to}} visit the earth floor, but they still prefer to <b>stay</b> on the <b>wire</b> mesh floor. TOEF did not compensate for the higher door weight by increasing the duration of the visits on the earth floor, which indicates that the value of an earth floor visit does not increase by staying longer on the earth floor. This supports the earlier findings that blue foxes value the earth floor for behaviours of short duration, e. g. exploration. Although, the FROEF accepted to stay longer (rest) on the earth floor when it became costly to leave the earth floor, we conclude that blue foxes {{are willing to work}} for leaving earth floor. A detailed behavioural analysis will clarify the reasons to enter and leave the earth floor. vo...|$|R
