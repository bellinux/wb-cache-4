50|$|Weavers' Hall {{began his}} second season by {{finishing}} second to <b>Starboard</b> <b>Buoy</b> over seven furlongs. He was then moved up in class and distance for the Nijinsky Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse {{in which he was}} matched against older horses. He finished fifth behind Ballymore who recorded an upset victory over the 1972 Epsom Derby winner Roberto. In the Lumville Stakes over one mile at the Curragh Racecourse in May he finished third behind the dead heaters Status Seeker and Boone's Cabin but was promoted to second when Boone's Cabin was disqualified. In the Players-Wills Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown he finished second, beaten two lengths by the Vincent O'Brien-trained Hail The Pirates.|$|E
50|$|The channel {{over the}} bar and into the harbour changes {{from time to time}} {{although}} the established buoyage system on the channel can usually be relied on to stay constant. A look out should be made for temporary pellet buoys and beacons to show changes in the channel. 175 degrees in from the leading buoy is a large conical buoy Number 1 flashing green and the large red Number 2, can buoy flashing red on the bar itself are both visible in most weather conditions. It is advisable to make good a course between these buoys until the smaller buoys of the channel become visible, after which it is better to favour the starboard side because there is a considerable east going tidal stream across the harbour entrance from approximately two hours before every high water. From the <b>starboard</b> <b>buoy</b> No.9 known as the 'Knock', the channel bends away towards the South East into considerably quieter waters. The wide sweep to the eastward just past the lifeboat house must be made with the red beacons close to port as the channel is quite narrow at this point. On passing the green buoy named the 'Pool', turn to the South West and follow the buoys to the last red can buoy (Number 14) then arc back Easterly close to the marsh edge and follow the red beacons to the Quayside.|$|E

2500|$|Exactly at midnight, {{shortly after}} passing the {{entrance}} <b>buoy,</b> <b>starboard</b> lookout reported breaker {{on the surface}} of the water right on the nose. According to the Indian Navy's claims, Captain Singh changed the course at full speed across the specified point and ordered to drop two depth charges, which was done. The explosions were [...] "stunning", and Rajput suffered a serious material concussion to its structure. However, visible results of this attack are not given. Rajput for some time surveyed the area dumping bombs, no longer found any contact — either visual or acoustic. A few minutes later, the destroyer continued her way to the coast of East Pakistan.|$|R
50|$|Haisborough Sands (or Haisboro Sands or Haisbro Sands) is a {{sandbank}} off {{the coast}} of Norfolk, England at Happisburgh. The shoal is 10 mi long and 1 mi wide and lies parallel to the North east coast of Norfolk. The shoal is marked to the north-west by north by the Haisbro Light Buoy, North cardinal. To the south-east by south is a light buoy South cardinal, and to the west by Mid Haisbro light <b>buoy</b> <b>starboard</b> hand. In 1995 there were three drying patches recorded to the north-north east and east-south east of the Mid Haisbro light buoy. Except at slack water their positions are indicated by tidal eddies and in slight or moderate seas the swell breaks on the shallower parts of the banks. There are a number of foul patches on {{the southern part of the}} shoal. There are very strong eddies on and around the bank especially on the north west. Over the years this shoal has claimed many ships.|$|R
50|$|It was {{now after}} 3:00 am and the Captain {{waited for the}} change of watch {{and went into the}} chart room before turning in for the night. There he and the chief officer studied the charts of the Haisbro buoys. The chief officer {{recommended}} that they steer a course more to port to avoid the flood tide carrying them farther starboard. As they spoke it was reported from the bridge that there was a light on the port bow. The captain and chief checked this sighting from the port rail. Realising that the Monte Nevoso was now by the South Middle Haisbro Light, the Captain ordered the bridge to turn hard to port. The Captain needed to be <b>starboard</b> of the <b>Buoy</b> for a safe passage. No sooner had he given the order, he got a reply that the ship wouldn’t answer to the helm. The captain soon realised that the Monte Nevoso had run aground on the Haisborough Sands. It was now 4:00 am and for the next four hours the Captain tried in vain to dislodge the Monte Nevoso from the Sands.|$|R
5000|$|The {{passengers}} and crew on Sophia realized their extreme danger. Many wrote letters to loved ones. At least two of these were later recovered. The letter of John R. [...] "Jack" [...] Maskell, found on his body, was widely printed in newspapers at the time: Shipwrecked off coast of AlaskaS.S. Princess SophiaOctober 24, 1918My own dear sweetheart,I am writing this my dear girl while the boat is in grave danger. We struck a rock last night which threw many from their berths, women rushed out in their night attire, some were crying, some too weak to move, but the lifeboats were swung out in all readiness but owing to the storm would be madness to launch until {{there was no hope}} for the ship. Surrounding ships were notified by wireless and in three hours the first steamer came, but cannot get near owing to the storm raging and the reef which we are on. There are now seven ships near. When the tide went down, two-thirds of the boat was high and dry. We are expecting the lights to go out at any minute, also the fires. The boat might go to pieces, for the force of the waves are terrible, making awful noises {{on the side of the}} boat, which has quite a list to port. No one is allowed to sleep, but believe me dear Dorrie it might have been much worse. Just hear there is a big steamer coming. We struck the reef in a terrible snowstorm. There is a big buoy near marking the danger but the captain was to port instead of to <b>starboard</b> of the <b>buoy.</b> I made my will this morning, leaving everything to you, my own true love and I want you to give £100 to my dear Mother, £100 to my dear Dad, £100 to dear wee Jack, and the balance of my estate (about £300) to you, Dorrie dear. The Eagle Lodge will take care of my remains.In danger at Sea.Princess Sophia24th October 1918To whom it may concern:Should anything happen to me notify, notify Eagle Lodge, Dawson.
