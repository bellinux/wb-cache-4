5|$|The {{concept of}} a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether {{remained}} in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking {{for changes in the}} speed of light depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the null result indicated <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference.|$|E
25|$|Despite the minuteness of {{the spatial}} terms, the first {{indications}} that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> Newtonian gravitation were discovered over a century-and-a-half ago. In 1859, Urbain Le Verrier, {{in an analysis}} of available timed observations of transits of Mercury over the Sun's disk from 1697 to 1848, reported that known physics could not explain the orbit of Mercury, unless there possibly existed a planet or asteroid belt within the orbit of Mercury. The perihelion of Mercury's orbit exhibited an excess rate of precession over that which could be explained by the tugs of the other planets. The ability to detect and accurately measure the minute value of this anomalous precession (only 43 arc seconds per tropical century) is testimony to the sophistication of 19th century astrometry.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} to the US, Spitzer {{calculated}} that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the ZETA results. He noticed that the apparent temperature, 5 million K, would not have time to develop during the short firing times. ZETA did not discharge enough energy into the plasma to heat it to those temperatures so quickly. If the temperature was increasing at the relatively slow rate his calculations suggested, fusion would not be taking place early in the reaction, and could not be adding energy that might make up the difference. Spitzer suspected the temperature reading was not accurate. Since it was the temperature reading that suggested the neutrons were from fusion, if the temperature was lower, it implied the neutrons were non-fusion in origin.|$|E

500|$|Oxbow drew post {{position}} {{five for}} the Haskell, carried the highest weight at 122 pounds, {{and was the}} second favorite in the race behind Verrazano. [...] Leading for {{the early part of}} the race, Oxbow was challenged for the lead by Verrazano at the three-quarter-mile marker, then weakened and finished fourth, earning another $60,000. Stevens felt <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> Oxbow at the half-mile pole, later saying the horse [...] "didn’t feel like he did in any of the Triple Crown races", and Lukas stated the jockey [...] "kind of held" [...] Oxbow from that point on. Oxbow was pulled up soon after crossing the finish line, then his rider jumped off and removed the saddle when Oxbow failed to jog sound on the track. [...] The horse walked back to the barn without obvious sign of injury, and radiographs of his right front ankle revealed no fracture, but he did have a soft tissue injury to the area, described as a [...] "sprain". Of Oxbow's overall health, Lukas commented, [...] "he had a pretty set of X-rays. It's amazing. For a horse with that many , they were really clean." [...] Nonetheless, as a result of the soft tissue injury, Oxbow was taken out of races for the duration of the summer, and after three weeks of hand-walking at Saratoga was shipped home to Calumet in mid-August, with an announcement that he was not anticipated to run again in 2013. Lukas said: [...] "He's been a warrior and a hell of a nice horse for us and I don't want to do anything to jeopardize his future down the line." [...] On October 25, 2013, Calumet Farm announced the decision to retire Oxbow. Combined with his winnings in his two-year-old season, his lifetime race earnings were $1,243,500. [...] He stood at stud for the 2014 breeding season at [...] Taylor Made Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, for an introductory stud fee of $20,000. He closed out the year ranked 17th in earnings with $1,146,000 won in 2013. For the 2015 season he moves to Calumet Farms, where he joins seven other stallions, including English Channel, who sired 2014 Travers Stakes winner V.E. Day.|$|E

2500|$|Predicate logic was {{primarily}} {{introduced to the}} mathematical community by C. S. Peirce, who coined the term second-order logic and whose notation is most similar to the modern form (Putnam 1982). However, today most students of logic are {{more familiar with the}} works of Frege, who actually published his work several years prior to Peirce but whose works remained in obscurity until Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead made them famous. [...] Frege used different variables to distinguish quantification over objects from quantification over properties and sets; but he did not see himself as doing two different kinds of logic. [...] After the discovery of Russell's paradox it was realized that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> his system. [...] Eventually logicians found that restricting Frege's logic in various ways—to what is now called first-order logic—eliminated this problem: sets and properties cannot be quantified over in first-order-logic alone. [...] The now-standard hierarchy of orders of logics dates from this time.|$|E
2500|$|Several of Desmond's lines, such as, [...] "All right Mr. DeMille, I'm {{ready for}} my close-up," [...] and [...] "I am big, it's the {{pictures}} that got small!" [...] are often quoted. Much of the film's wit is delivered through Norma Desmond's deadpan comments, which are often followed by sarcastic retorts from Gillis. Desmond appears to not hear some of these comments, as she is absorbed by her own thoughts and in denial, and so some of Gillis's lines are heard only by the audience, with Wilder blurring {{the line between the}} events and Gillis's narration. Gillis's response to Desmond's cry that [...] "the pictures got small" [...] is a muttered reply, [...] "I knew <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> them". Wilder often varies the structure, with Desmond taking Gillis's comments seriously and replying in kind. For example, when the two discuss the overwrought script Desmond has been working on, Gillis observes, [...] "They'll love it in Pomona." [...] "They'll love it everyplace," [...] replies Desmond firmly.|$|E

He posted five top 10s in 2001, but dropped to 19th in the standings. While competing in the Daytona 500, {{he was involved in}} a final-lap crash where Dale Earnhardt crashed into the wall and died. The image of Schrader peering into Earnhardt's car, only to jump back and frantically signal for assistance, is etched into the minds of many racing fans; his interview with Jeanne Zelasko during Fox Sports' post-race show was the first sign to many that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the seven-time Winston Cup champion, as he appeared visibly shaken and upon being asked if Earnhardt was okay, he said [...] "I don't really know. I'm not a doctor. I got the heck {{out of the way as}} soon as they got there." [...] In 2002, Schrader did not finish in the top 10 in a single race, the first time since 1984. Following that season, he departed MB2.|$|E

2500|$|On Sunday afternoon, July 1, 1928, Yale {{was in his}} Sunrise Club, {{located at}} 14th Avenue and 65th Street, when he {{received}} a cryptic phone call. The caller said <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> Yale's new wife Lucy, who was at home looking after their year-old daughter. Refusing Joseph Piraino's offer to drive him, Yale dashed out to his brand new, coffee-colored Lincoln coupe and took off up New Utrecht Avenue, where a Buick sedan carrying four armed individuals stopped next to him. While Yale's new Lincoln was fashioned with armor plating, the dealer had neglected to bullet-proof the windows. Recognizing his peril, when the light changed, Yale [...] took off. After a chase up New Utrecht, Yale swerved west onto 44th Street, with the Buick close behind. Yale's car was soon overtaken by the Buick, whose occupants opened fire at close range. A shotgun blast struck the Brooklyn gang boss {{on the left side}} of the head while a submachine gun bullet sliced through his brain. Either wound would have killed Yale instantly. The now out-of-control Lincoln veered to the right, hopped the curb, and crashed into the stoop of a brownstone at No. 923. This was the first time a submachine gun had been used in a Gangland killing in New York City.|$|E
