This study compares results using modified changzhu population GDP per capita data with results using official <b>statistical</b> <b>materials.</b> The empirical results are as follows: (1) Studies since the 1990 s have overestimated interprovince disparities; (2) inter-province disparities have decreased since 2005; and (3) The western region has experienced an increase in intra-regional disparities since 2002. These results suggest that provincial GDP per capita statistics should be used more carefully. Regional Disparities, GDP per capita, Statistics, China...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{progress}} {{that has been made}} in studies on geographic differentials of mortality in Africa. In general, there is very little known about adult mortality in many Third World countries, and the contributions of geographers have been limited in this area. In many African countries, enormous problems in studies on mortality were encountered due to incomplete and unreliable information. Differential levels of mortality are reported in different regions of the African continent and even within each country. Higher childhood mortality rates are recorded in West and Central Africa when compared with East and Southern Africa; relatively low rates are reported in the Magreb and the lowest in the small island territories. However, the role of geographic and environmental factors at both regional and urban levels are least exploited. Hence, many analyses of mortality in Africa have concentrated more on formal <b>statistical</b> <b>materials</b> and not on the realities of the existing ecological and environmental situation. The paper calls on geographers to exploit ways of utilizing the enormous clinic-based data in the continent. However, even more can be accomplished when geographers conduct interdisciplinary research on mortality in Africa. nature and quality of data environmental conditions <b>statistical</b> <b>materials</b> clinic-based data...|$|R

It is a centrally air-conditioned, state-of-the-art building housing a library, a cyber network centre, faculty chambers and class rooms. The library is well equipped with over 30,000 volumes consisting of reference books, back volumes of journals and law reports, current legal periodicals and a wealth of <b>statistical</b> <b>material</b> and rare collections. The students maintain the computerized ‘knowledge management system’ that adds around 5000 student projects to the database annually and aids in disseminating information for research. Photocopying facility is available within the premises. A range of online access like lexis-nexis, Manupatra and other legal research based software such as SCC Online and Grand Jurix are available for research. More databases on Legal and Humanities and Social Sciences are in the process of addition to the existing array of Electronic Databases. It is in the process of implementing the advances in Information and Communication Technologies and RFID enabled solutions for all its transactions, inventory and resource management. The library has received wide acclaim and recommendation from legal luminaries and experts like Justice G. K. Acquah, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ghana, Justice V. S.

50|$|Even when {{concentrating on}} {{dedicated}} mobility programmes (or programmes where mobility {{is a distinct}} activity) are we faced with problems.First, problems of definition can make comparability difficult.Second (and partly {{as a consequence of}} this), the way in which information is gathered (and what is gathered) may differ from programme to programme, which makes it yet more difficult to come up with robust and comparable information. It is not possible to see from the <b>statistical</b> <b>material</b> available whether some activities were undertaken as placements or as another form of mobility. Moreover, mobility programmes (or programmes incorporating mobility activities) are undertaken in many different contexts, and there is virtually no national level overview of all mobility activities.The annual Dutch BISON monitoring report of international mobility within education and training remains an isolated initiative, but it includes only mobility taking place within the framework of educational establishments. In addition, all the information available is concerned with outgoing mobility (the sending aspect), and there is no indication of incoming mobility (hosting). This lack of quantitative data makes it very difficult to arrive at any figures concerning both the participation rates and financing involved.For the Leonardo da Vinci programme, we can give very precise indications on participation rates and the amount of funding in the programme, but we do not have figures on funding that also involves national cofinancing. Given the different ways of calculating this from project to project, and the varying percentage of Commission funding, a conservative estimate would put this at a level equal to the Commission’s contribution (e.g. for {{the second phase of the}} Leonardo da Vinci programme, approximately EUR 600 million).|$|E
