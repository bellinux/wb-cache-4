[...] This development was stifled by commercialism, Nicholson <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> genre [...] "mutated into a peculiar species of jazz-inflected pop music that eventually took up residence on FM radio" [...] {{at the end of the}} 1970s.|$|E

[...] Correlli, devised by Australian actress Denise Roberts, was a 10-part drama series on ABC, Jackman's first major professional job, and where he met his future wife Deborra-Lee Furness. [...] "Meeting my wife was the greatest thing to come out of it," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> show lasted only one season. After Correlli Jackman went on the stage in Melbourne.

2500|$|At around 5:00a.m. on July 9, 2011, {{at least}} eight alleged gunmen of the Gulf Cartel entered the first {{domicile}} of the Cázares family in neighborhood San Francisco in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico {{to carry out a}} kidnapping. The first house was owned by Rodolfo Cázares Garza. The kidnappers were wearing military-style uniforms and ski-masks, but the victims noticed that they were sporting white-colored sneakers, speaking vulgarities, and looking for valuable house possessions, which suggested they were not law enforcement or military personnel. They stormed each of the bedrooms in the house to round up the victims before blindfolding them (except for two children). Once the kidnappers ordered the patriarch to open the family's safe, they forced all the family into their vehicles before taking off. By 7:00a.m., the Gulf Cartel kidnappers reached the second home of the Cázares in neighborhood Río and forced the family to open their front door. [...] "We have your brother", one of the kidnappers <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> others guarded the entrance booth of the neighborhood with assault rifles. Four more relatives were kidnapped at the second domicile, owned by Rodolfo's brother Héctor Cázares Garza. However, one of them managed to escape through {{the back door of the}} house before running to the third house of the Cázares a few blocks away. A few minutes later, the kidnappers made their way into the third house, owned by Alberto Cázares Garza, one of the other brothers. By 8:00a.m., 18 members of the Cázares family were kidnapped. This mass abduction stood out from other kidnapping cases in Mexico because all of the victims were related.|$|E
2500|$|On January 3, 1958, at 6:15 pm, a {{few days}} before Frances was {{scheduled}} to lead a junket of editors to Brazil, the Rushmores met inside the lobby of their apartment building in a final attempt at reconciliation. Frances was due to have dinner at the Dobbins' at 8 pm. When an argument broke out between the couple, Frances left to hail a taxi. Taxi driver Edward Pearlman picked her up at Madison Avenue and 97th Street. Simultaneously, Howard entered the cab. As the two continued arguing, Pearlman ordered him out of the cab to which he replied, “I’m her husband, don’t worry about it.” “Where do you want to go?” Pearlman asked. “Take me to a police station,” Frances <b>said.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> cab raced to the 23rd Precinct at Third and 104th, they were only two blocks away when Frances screamed, “Oh my God!” Suddenly, three gunshots fired inside the cab. Rushmore had shot his wife in {{the right side of the}} head and neck then put the pistol to his temple and shot himself. At the police station, an unregistered [...]32 Colt revolver was found in Rushmore's hand and a seven-inch commando knife inside the waistband of his trousers. Jean Dobbins speculated that her mother's refusal to take Rushmore to Brazil might have started the argument that ended in the shooting. Contrary to general expectations, Dobbs said her parents quarreled [...] "over personal things, not Rushmore's controversial public life ... 'He was very possessive, very jealous, and wanted to go everywhere with her." [...] Frances Rushmore's father, Louis Everitt, the owner of a women's shoe store in Charlotte, brought his daughter's body back to North Carolina.|$|E
