25|$|Growing up she famously <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> {{fit into}} the {{religious}} and conservative views of Nigeria.

Later, after a government review discovered some of her emails contained classified information, she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> sent or received information that was marked classified.

25|$|Ventura filed a {{defamation}} {{suit against}} Kyle in January 2012. Ventura initially considered dropping the lawsuit, but said several retired Navy SEALs (including {{the owner of}} McP's) demanded that Ventura continue his lawsuit, which Ventura did after Kyle failed {{to agree on a}} settlement in which he would state that the incident never happened. In a motion filed by Kyle's attorney in August 2012 to dismiss two of the suit's three counts, declarations by five former SEALs and the mothers of two others supported Kyle's account. However, in a motion filed by Ventura, Bill DeWitt, a close friend of Ventura and former SEAL who was present with him at the bar, suggested that Ventura interacted with a few SEALs but was involved in no confrontation with Kyle, and said that Kyle's claims were false. DeWitt's wife also <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> witnessed any fight between Kyle and Ventura.|$|E
500|$|After the song's release, {{the phrase}} [...] "material girl" [...] became another {{nickname}} for Madonna. She often remarked that [...] "Material Girl" [...] is the song she most regrets recording, {{as it became}} a label that has been attached to her for decades. She also said if she had known this, she probably would never have recorded it. After making the video, Madonna <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> wanted to be compared to Monroe, despite posing as the Hollywood icon and recreating many of Marilyn's signature poses for various photos shoots, most notably a 1991 issue of Vanity Fair. Reflecting on the song, Madonna told author J. Randy Taraborrelli: ...|$|E

500|$|Moore {{frequently}} {{moved around}} the United States as a child, due to her father's occupation. She was close to her family as a result, but has <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> had the feeling of coming from one particular place. The family lived in multiple locations, including Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Panama, Nebraska, Alaska, New York, and Virginia, and Moore attended nine different schools. The constant relocating made her an insecure child, and she struggled to establish friendships. Despite these difficulties, Moore later remarked that an itinerant lifestyle was beneficial to her future career: [...] "When you move around a lot, you learn that behavior is mutable. I would change, depending on where I was... It teaches you to watch, to reinvent, that character can change." ...|$|E
500|$|Woodburne has <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> gets bored {{of playing}} Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of {{this job is}} that in a week you might be doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, you might be doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe some nice subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character. It was good to see those dents in her armour I think".|$|E
500|$|The People v. Jackson {{trial began}} in Santa Maria, California, on January 31, 2005. During the trial, the judge allowed {{testimony}} about past allegations, including the 1993 case, to establish whether the defendant had a propensity to commit certain crimes. However, Jordan Chandler {{had left the}} country to avoid testifying. In a lecture at Harvard after the trial, Thomas Mesereau said, [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get him}} to show up and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] June Chandler testified that she had npt spoken to her son in 11 years. At one point in her testimony, she claimed that she could not remember being sued by Jackson (who had counter-sued for extortion) and at another point said that she had never heard of her own attorney. However, she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> witnessed any molestation.|$|E

500|$|Quintanilla, Jr. {{sought to}} {{maintain}} Selena's image clean and family-oriented. In 1989, she was offered sponsorship from beer companies {{but her father}} turned them down. Selena was often refused gigs at Tejano venues {{because she was a}} female singer in a male-dominated music scene. Manuel Peña wrote that after 1989, Selena's popularity increased and she became a sex icon following the release of her debut album. Charles Tatum said Selena drew most attention from her [...] "beauty, sexuality, and youthful impact on the Tejano music scene". Selena <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> wanted to record explicit songs because of her upbringing and because her fan base consisted largely of young children, who regarded her as a role model. She further commented on the question of her sexual appeal to men during her crossover attempt, asserting that she will [...] "stay the same" [...] and that her English-language recordings will refrain from foul language and sexual themes. In 1997, María Celeste Arrarás wrote in her book about Selena's death that the singer was a [...] "sweet and charismatic girl". According to Arrarás, Selena [...] "trusted everyone"; she often went shopping alone, despite her father's concerns over her safety.|$|E
500|$|In January 1995, Debra Ramirez, Selena's cousin, {{was hired}} {{to work in the}} boutiques and to help Selena expand the {{business}} into Mexico. Ramirez quit within a week, telling Saldívar she was dissatisfied with the failure of staff members to report sales. Ramirez also found receipts were missing from the sale of several boutique items. Saldívar told her to [...] "mind [...] business" [...] and that it was not her concern. Saldívar frequently clashed with Martin Gomez, Selena's fashion designer, who complained that Saldívar was mismanaging Selena's affairs. Their animosity intensified during Selena's fashion shows; Gomez accused Saldívar of mutilating or destroying some of his original creations and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> paid bills. Gomez stated that Saldívar had [...] "established a reign of terror"; the two were constantly complaining about each other to Selena. Saldívar began recording their conversations without Gomez's consent to persuade Selena he was not working for the boutiques' best interests. Gomez was relegated to a supporting role when Selena decided to design her clothes herself. Between late 1994 and early 1995, Saldívar often traveled to Monterrey, Mexico, to expedite the process of opening another Selena Etc. store. When Saldívar visited the factory in Mexico, she intimidated the seamstresses by telling them to either side with her or leave.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{has stated}} that the song she most regrets {{recording}} is [...] "Material Girl" [...] and if she had known that the label would be attached to her for decades, she would probably never have done so. After making the video, Madonna <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> wanted to be compared to Monroe, despite posing like her and recreating many of Monroe's signature poses for various photos shoots, most notably in a 1991 issue of Vanity Fair. Guilbert commented that [...] "material girl" [...] designated {{a certain type of}} liberated women, thus deviating from its original coinage which meant a girl who is tangible and accessible. Author Nicholas Cook said that the meaning and impact of [...] "material girl" [...] was no more circumscribed by the video, rather by its song. Its influence was seen later among such diverse groups such as female versus male, gay versus straight, and academic versus teenage. In 1993, a conference was held at the University of California at Santa Barbara, with the subject as Madonna: Feminist Icon or Material Girl? The conference pondered on the duality of Madonna as both of them and deduced that the question of Madonna's feminism is not easy to decide. Some of the feminists left the conference, citing that they {{had not been able to}} make up their minds.|$|E

500|$|During {{their second}} meeting, Cisneros asked Martínez {{to cast a}} spell on Fischer. Martínez said {{she was unable to}} do that, and Cisneros grew angry and left the store. A few days later, Cisneros called Martínez and asked her to pray for Fischer to get back {{together}} with Cristina. Cisneros returned for a third visit to Martínez's shop in October 1992, and asked her if she knew anyone willing to beat up Fischer. By winter, she changed her request and asked to have Fischer killed, offering US$3,000 to the person who would do it. According to Martínez, Cisneros told her that Fischer had raped Cristina and was telling his classmates at St. Joe that he had sex with her. However, Cristina <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> had sex with him. Although Garza assured Martínez that he would find someone to carry out the job, he kept calling and visiting her to discuss his marriage problems. Under pressure from Cisneros, Martínez would often interrupt the sessions with Garza to remind him of the plan. Garza lied to Martínez on several occasions telling her he had someone lined up to kill Fischer. Cisneros contacted Martínez in November to ask her why the job had not been done. Martínez responded that she did not know when the murder would be carried out. Garza eventually divorced his wife on January 4, 1993, and kept calling Martínez to tell her his personal problems had not been fixed. On January 9, he traveled to Brownsville from San Antonio to talk about the divorce, and Martínez reminded him that a client of hers wanted Fischer dead. She told him again that if he facilitated Fischer's murder, Garza's personal problems would be solved.|$|E

When the program first aired, the Food Network received mail accusing the network of hiring a model or actress pretending to cook instead of a real chef.|$|E

It was a place where some unxplained paranormal activities had occurred including a crow bar being thrown and her husband Karl Beattie collapsing on the floor. She had <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> wanted to return there again, but for Halloween, she decided the location was perfect for another investigation.|$|E
2500|$|During October 2009, Clinton said, [...] "this {{is a great}} job. It is a 24/7 job" [...] and [...] "this job is {{incredibly}} all-encompassing." [...] She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> thought about if she were making the same foreign policy decisions as president, and {{had no intention of}} ever running for that office again. While some friends and former advisers thought she was primarily saying that to focus attention on her current role and that she might change her mind about running for president in the future, others felt that she was genuinely content with the direction her career and life had taken and no longer had presidential ambitions.|$|E

However, Walker's girlfriend Louise, who was present on the night of his murder, <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> would forgive them adding, [...] "I hate them for what they have done. Anthony and I shared something special. Now he has been taken away from me by those two evil young men. I still feel that he (Anthony Walker) is around. Yesterday, I sent Anthony a text and just told him he (Barton) had been found guilty. It seemed the natural thing to do." ...|$|E
