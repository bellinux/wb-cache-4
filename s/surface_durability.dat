The fact that the diamond-ground surface is nearly always dry (except during storms) reduces any freeze-thaw problems.

A disadvantage is their low precision: measurement results may differ 10% and more.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the effects of the shot-peening process on the fatigue characteristics of austempered ductile iron (ADI). Experiments mainly involve <b>surface</b> <b>durability</b> tests using cylindrical roller specimens and bending fatigue tests, as well as X-ray stress measurements. The elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) theory was used in the determination of <b>surface</b> <b>durability.</b> It was found that the <b>surface</b> <b>durability</b> of the shot-peened ADI was slightly lower than the of the non-shot-peened ADI, and this difference was attributed to the difference in surface roughness. Moreover, it was found that residual stress does not affect the <b>surface</b> <b>durability</b> of the shot-peened ADI. Results also showed that the shot-peening of the ADI is useful for improving the bending fatigue strength. Consequently, from the viewpoint of fatigue strength of ADI, surface roughness, especially as related to the <b>surface</b> <b>durability,</b> should be strongly considered in the case of application of shot-peened ADI to machine elements subjected to bending and/or sliding abrasion. 歯車材の表面改質の研究の一環...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to study the {{influence}} of manufacturing variations on gear performance. The manufacturing variations inherent in different manufacturing methods were studied to include the effect of real surfaces. Real surfaces have surface irregularities at least on some scale, which can significantly influence how loads are transmitted at the gear contact. To some extent, the lubricant design can help to prevent contact {{that could lead to}} tooth failures by forming a protective surface boundary layer. An experimental study was used to consider the compositions of these layers with a surface analysis method. In Paper A a robust design approach was used to find out to what extent the current standard for calculation of <b>surface</b> <b>durability</b> treats manufacturing variations and the choice of lubricant. The results show that the simplest calculation method used is not enough to predict the effect of these on <b>surface</b> <b>durability.</b> Additionally, the standard quality levels are poorly incorporated in the standard calculating procedures for <b>surface</b> <b>durability,</b> {{and the quality of the}} gear tooth is restricted to include only a few parameters. In Paper B a pin-on-disc machine was used to evaluate the tribofilm formation by the additives and the corresponding wear occurring in the boundary lubrication regime in environmentally adapted lubricants. Studies of the additive and base fluid interaction were carried out using glow discharge-optical emission spectroscopy. It was found that the chemically reacted surface boundary layers played an important role in terms of wear. More specifically, the oxide layer thickness had significant influence on wear. The findings also demonstrate the complexity of lubrication design formulations coupled to these layers. For example, it was found that the pre-existing surface boundary layer (before any lubricant had been added) played an important role in allowing the lubricant to react properly with the surfaces. The aim of Paper C was to contribute to the knowledge of how different surface topographies, tied to manufacturing methods, influence the early life contact conditions in gears. Topographical measurements of differently manufactured tooth flanks were used as data input to a contact analysis program. The variation in surface topography inherent in the manufacturing method was found to have a strong influence on the contact area ratio...|$|E

The purpose of this thesis is to clarify the impact of variation in the gear tooth flank tribological system on the gear contact load capacity – to increase the understanding of how surface topography and lubricant interact. In this thesis the variation in surface topography inherent in the manufacturing method has been shown, by experimental work and computer simulations, {{to be an important}} factor for the contact condition in the early life of gears. Surface analysis revealed that the formation and composition of surface boundary layers depends strongly on the chemical composition of the lubricant, but also on pre-existing surface boundary layers.
