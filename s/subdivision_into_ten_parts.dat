This paper has investigated the vulnerability of irregular buildings in near-field earthquakes using cumulative damage indices (ductility, energy, Park-Ang). In this study, the panel zone is considered, and irregular buildings are modeled three dimensionally. In order to do nonlinear dynamic analysis, each element was divided <b>into</b> <b>ten</b> <b>parts.</b> In these parts, the stresses and strains were derived from three points at the top, middle, and bottom corners of the section.|$|R

Firstly, the basic characteristics of mergers are described, followed by their segmental classification and the main causes of their existence. The largest part of the thesis deals with mergers according to the Czech precept of law. Moreover, mergers are analyzed from the accounting point of view involving the perspective of both Czech accounting regulations and International accounting standards.

30|$|Cross {{validation}} is {{a practical}} method of statistically cutting a sample of data into smaller subsets. The basic idea is to group the data set in a sense, one part as a training set and the other as a validation set or test set. First, train the classifier with the training set, and then use the validation set to test the trained model, {{and use it as}} a performance indicator for evaluating the classifier. This paper selects 10 -fold cross validation to divide the data set <b>into</b> <b>ten</b> <b>parts</b> and takes 9 of them as training and 1 of them as verification. The average of the 10 results is used as an estimate of the accuracy of the algorithm.|$|R
60|$|The {{scheme of}} {{encouraging}} clergymen to build houses by dividing a living of £500 a-year <b>into</b> <b>ten</b> <b>parts,</b> is a contrivance, the meaning whereof hath {{got on the}} wrong side of my comprehension; unless it may be argued, that bishops build no houses, because they are so rich; and therefore, the inferior clergy will certainly build, if you reduce them to beggary. But I knew a very rich man of quality in England, who could never be persuaded to keep a servant out of livery; because such servants would be expensive, and apt, in time, to look like gentlemen; whereas the others were ready to submit to the basest offices, and at a cheaper pennyworth might increase his retinue.|$|R

30|$|For {{nonlinear}} dynamic analysis, using OpenSees, an open-source {{finite element}} platform {{has been developed}} at the University of California-Berkeley for earthquake performance assessment (Mazzoni et al. 2006). Fy, E, G, and strain hardness {{were considered to be}} 2, 400 kg/cm 2, 2.1 × 106, 807, 692.30, and 3 %, respectively. For nonlinear dynamic analysis, a nonlinear beam column element is used, which is based on the non-iterative (or iterative) force formulation, and considers the distribution of plasticity along the element. In order to do nonlinear dynamic analysis, each element was divided <b>into</b> <b>ten</b> <b>parts.</b> In these parts, the stresses and strains were derived from three points at the top, middle, and bottom corners of the section by which cyclic energy dissipation in each frame element was calculated.|$|R
30|$|For {{the first}} mode and all modes with {{cumulative}} mass participation factor exceeding 90  %, Rayleigh equivalent damping {{was defined as}} 5  %. The strain–stress hysteresis behavior of steel was modelled as a bilinear with a strain hardening ratio of 3  %. To perform NTHA, time steps and sub-steps have been considered to be 0.005  s and 1000, respectively. In all analysis, P-Delta effect has been included. To model plastic hinge {{at the end of}} elements, inelastic force-based element with fiber-distributed plasticity was selected. To do nonlinear dynamic analysis by means of Opensees, each element was divided <b>into</b> <b>ten</b> <b>parts</b> (McKenna et al. 2000). In these parts, the stresses and strains were derived from three points at the top, middle, and bottom corners of the section.|$|R
50|$|The Act {{consisted}} of 137 sections organised <b>into</b> <b>ten</b> <b>parts.</b> Part 1 outlined {{the functions of}} Ministers in relation to water resources. Part 2 dealt with the setting up of River Authorities and the Water Resources Board. Part 3 covered the assessment of water resources. Part 4 dealt with the abstraction and impounding of water, while part 5 dealt with charges for abstraction and impounding of water. the The powers of River Authorities in relation to land were covered by part 6, while part 7 outlined additional functions of River Authorities. Part 8 dealt with financial considerations, part 9 detailed the transfer of undertakings of River Boards, and part 10 covered miscellaneous and supplementary provisions. This was followed by 14 schedules.|$|R
5|$|The Years of Rice and Salt is an {{alternate}} history novel written by science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson {{and published in}} 2002. The novel explores how world history {{might have been different}} if the Black Death plague had killed 99% of Europe's population, instead of a third. Divided <b>into</b> <b>ten</b> <b>parts,</b> the story spans hundreds of years, from the army of the Muslim conqueror Timur to the 21st century, with Europe being re-populated by Muslim pioneers, the indigenous peoples of the Americas forming a league to resist Chinese and Muslim invaders, and a 67-year-long world war being fought primarily between Muslim states and the Chinese and their allies. While the <b>ten</b> <b>parts</b> take place in different times and places, they are connected by a group of characters that are reincarnated into each time but are identified to the reader by the first letter of their name being consistent in each life.|$|R

30|$|Decile is any of {{the nine}} values that divides the sorted data <b>into</b> <b>ten</b> equal <b>parts</b> so that each part {{represents}} 1 / 10 of the sample or population.

50|$|Sixteen is {{the fourth}} power of two. For this reason, 16 was used in {{weighing}} light objects in several cultures. The British have 16 ounces in one pound; the Chinese used to have 16 liangs in one jin. In old days, weighing was done with a beam balance to make equal splits. It {{would be easier to}} split a heap of grains into sixteen equal parts through successive divisions than to split <b>into</b> <b>ten</b> <b>parts.</b> Chinese Taoists did finger computation on the trigrams and hexagrams by counting the finger tips and joints of the fingers with the tip of the thumb. Each hand can count up to 16 in such manner. The Chinese abacus uses two upper beads to represent the 5s and 5 lower beads to represent the 1s, the 7 beads can represent a hexadecimal digit from 0 to 15 in each column.|$|R

Sixteen subjects estimated the cover level of artificial vegetation patterns displayed on the screen for various levels of resolution (from presence/absence to 100 different states, each measured on the ratio scale). We found that estimation error is minimum when the range of cover is divided <b>into</b> <b>ten</b> equal <b>parts.</b> Finer resolution gives less precise estimation since subjects tend to divide cover level <b>into</b> <b>ten</b> or at most twenty intervals in their mind...|$|R
