40|$|Abstract- In {{order to}} {{conserve}} {{natural resources and}} economize energy, weight reduction has been {{the main focus of}} automobile manufacturer in the present scenario. Weight reduction can be achieved primarily by the introduction of better material, design optimization and better manufacturing processes. The suspension leaf spring is one of the potential items for weight reduction in automobile as it accounts for ten to twenty percent of the unsprung weight. This helps in achieving the vehicle with improved riding qualities. It is well known that springs, are designed to absorb and store energy and then release it. Hence, the strain energy of the material becomes a major factor in designing the springs. It can be easily observed that material having lower modulus and density will have a greater specific strain energy capacity. The introduction of composite materials was made it possible to reduce the weight of the leaf spring without any reduction on load carrying capacity and stiffness. Since; the composite materials have more elastic strain energy storage capacity (1) and high strength-to-weight ratio as compared to those of steel. It is seen that from the graph that when load increases the bending stress increases linearly. So load-stress graph gives the straight line relationship. At lower loads both theoretical and ANSYS results are very close, but when load increases the ANSYS results are uniformly reduced compared to theoretical results. The deflection in steel leaf spring is less as compared to the composite leaf spring as shown in the above graphs. Springs are placed between the road wheels and the body. When the wheel comes across a bump on the road, it rises and deflects the spring, there by storing energy there in. On releasing, due to the elasticity of the spring material, it rebounds there by expending the stored energy. In this way the spring starts vibrating, of course, with amplitude decreasing gradually on account of internal friction of the spring material and friction of the <b>suspension</b> <b>joints,</b> till vibrations die down.

40|$|The portal axle is an {{off-road}} technology {{which is}} designed to provide higher ground clearance and increased torque at the wheels. The portal axle is typically mounted on the knuckle of the vehicle, allowing both the axle tubing and differential casing to be mounted higher under the vehicle. The usage of the portal axle system brings about two distinctive drawbacks; compromised ride comfort and increased torsional loadings on the drive shaft. In this study, an experimental test was carried out to determine the torsional strength and failure mode of the portal axle drive shaft. The experimental results were then verified using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Results from both experimental and FEA methods indicate that shaft failure occurs at the gear spline. However, there is a big discrepancy in the torsional stress values, in which the FEA results are significantly higher than the measured experimental values. This is reasonable considering that the shaft simulation analysis is conducted in a static structural manner, in which the flanged side of the shaft is fixed (zero displacement). On the other hand, this study also describes the influence of portal axles on passenger ride comfort. Here, the on road experiment is conducted by placing an accelerometer in the cabin of a portal axle equipped vehicle. The ride comfort experiments are conducted using two vehicles. The first being a normal pickup truck and the second being a pickup truck with the portal axles equipped. Both vehicles are of the same make, model and age. All measurements are performed on normal highways and over regular speed humps. The results from the ride comfort experiment indicate that the use of the portal axles result in significant deterioration of ride comfort. In order to validate the experimental results, a quarter car model representing the portal axle vehicle is simulated using Matlab’s Simulink function. Simulation results also indicate that the use of the portal axles adversely affects the ride comfort. However, when comparing the simulation to the experimental results, there is an 18 % discrepancy in the results. This is primarily attributed {{to the fact that the}} quarter car model does not take into account the suspension bushings, <b>suspension</b> <b>joints</b> and chassis bending (flex) of the vehicle...|$|E

40|$|For good crop emergence, {{the seed}} {{should be placed}} at a depth where good {{conditions}} concerning oxygen, temperature and water are provided. To place the seed in the soil, some type of see d coulter is used. Väderstad-Verkens Rapid is a seed drill that places the seed at a certain depth {{in relation to a}} wheel running on the ground. This can lead to a to shallow seed placement. On fields with clayey soils and spring sown cereals a to shallow seed placement can lead to poor emergence, especially if there is no rainfall after seeding. To improve the ability of the Rapid drill to place the seed in moist soil, Väderstad-Verken has developed a spring-loaded coulter. This coulter, like the ordinary Rapid coulter, is placed beside a disc but it can move up and down approximately 15 mm. The idea is to make a coulter which is adjusted to follow the soil mechanical resistance and place the seed in an environment favorable for germination. The aim of this thesis was to compare the performance of the new spring-loaded coulter with the ordinary Rapid coulter. A field experiment was carried out to investigate seed placement and germination. Oats were sown in the spring with three different coulters, one ordinary Rapid coulter and two spring-loaded coulters with different spring-forces, at three different sowing depths. In another experiment the go al was to study how the spring-loaded coulters were moving during sowing. Two linear position sensors were used to measure the movement, one on a coulter with high spring-force and one on a coulter with low spring-force. Three different working speeds and four different sowing depths were used during the test. Compared with the ordinary Rapid coulter the spring-loaded coulters placed a higher proportion of the seeds at a correct depth. Also the plant emergence was better for the spring-loaded coulter. There was little difference in seed placement and plant emergence between the high and low spring-force coulter. The coulter with high spring-force worked deeper and with less standard deviation than the coulter with low spring-force. Both coulters worked more shallow in relation to the disc when the sowing depth or working speed was increased. The standard deviation of the coulter movements was only slightly affected by the sowing depth. The coulter movements were compared with the relief of the seedbed bottom, as measured by a laser. There was no significant relation between the coulter movements and the shape of the seedbed bottom. The advantage of the spring-loaded coulter was that it manages to work deeper than the ordinary Rapid coulter. To make the spring-loaded coulter more able to follow the uneven bottom under the harrowed layer some changes in the design might be necessary. The coulter must be able to move more, especially downwards. The coulter should have longer pivot arm with a low pivot axis and less friction in the <b>suspension</b> <b>joint.</b> Furthermore the spring force should be adjustable.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the area of}} Metal Matrix Composites (MMC's) have brought these materials to a maturity stage where the technology is ready for transition to large-volume production and commercialization. The new materials seem to allow the fabrication of higher quality parts at less than 50 percent of the weight as compared to steel, especially when they are selectively reinforced with carbon, silicon carbide, or aluminum oxide fibers. Most of the developments in the MMC materials have been spurred, mainly by applications that require high structural performance at elevated temperatures, the heavy vehicle industry could also benefit from this emerging technology. Increasing requirements of weight savings and extended durability are the main drivers for potential insertion of MMC technology into the heavy vehicle market. Critical elements of a typical tractor-trailer combination, such as highly loaded sections of the structure, engine components, brakes, <b>suspensions,</b> <b>joints</b> and bearings could be improved through judicious use of MMC materials. Such an outcome would promote the DOE's programmatic objectives of increasing the fuel efficiency of heavy vehicles and reducing their life cycle costs and pollution levels. However, significant technical and economical barriers are likely to hinder or even prevent broad applications of MMC materials in heavy vehicles. The tradeoffs between such expected benefits (lower weights and longer durability) and penalties (higher costs, brittle behavior, and difficult to machine) must be thoroughly investigated both from the performance and cost viewpoints, before the transfer of MMC technology to heavy vehicle systems can be properly assessed and implemented. MMC materials are considered to form one element of the comprehensive, multi-faceted strategy pursued by the High Strength/Weight Reduction (HS/WR) Materials program of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) for structural weight savings and quality enhancements in heavy vehicles. The research work planed for the first year of this project (June 1, 2003 through May 30, 2004) focused on a theoretical investigation of weight benefits and structural performance tradeoffs associated with the design, fabrication, and joining of MMC components for heavy-duty vehicles. This early research work conducted at West Virginia University yielded the development of integrated material-structural models that predicted marginal benefits and significant barriers to MMC applications in heavy trailers. The results also indicated that potential applications of MMC materials in heavy vehicles are limited to components identified as critical for either loadings or weight savings. Therefore, the scope of the project was expanded in the following year (June 1, 2004 through May 30, 2005) focused on expanding the lightweight material-structural design concepts for heavy vehicles from the component to the system level. Thus, the following objectives were set: (1) Devise and evaluate lightweight structural configurations for heavy vehicles. (2) Study the feasibility of using Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) for critical structural components and joints in heavy vehicles. (3) Develop analysis tools, methods, and validated test data for comparative assessments of innovative design and joining concepts. (4) Develop analytical models and software for durability predictions of typical heavy vehicle components made of particulate MMC or fiber-reinforced composites.

In this paper, we will describe the basic behavioral properties of hexapod walking, as they are known from stick insects, and a simple neural network called Walknet, which exemplifies these properties and also shows some interesting emergent properties. The network contains internal recurrent connections, but important recurrent connections utilize the loop through the environment. This approach leads to a subnet for controlling the three joints of a leg during its swing which is arguably the simplest possible solution. The task for the stance subnet appears more difficult because the movements of a larger and varying number of joints (9 - 18 : three for each leg in stance) have to be controlled such that each leg contributes efficiently to support and propulsion and legs do not work at cross purposes. Already inherently non-linear, this task is further complicated by four factors: 1) the combination of legs in stance varies continuously, 2) during curve walking, legs must move at different speeds, 3) on compliant substrates, {{the speed of the}} individual leg may vary unpredictably, and 4) the geometry of the system may vary through growth and injury or due to non-rigid <b>suspension</b> of the <b>joints.</b> This task appears to require some kind of “motor intelligence”. We show that an extremely decentralized, simple controller, based on a combination of negative and positive feedback at the joint level, copes with all these problems. This is possible because we exploit the physical properties of the system to simplify explicit calculations. Walknet is able to control walking at different speeds with an emerging tripod or tetrapod gait pattern, curve walking without any explicit calculation of leg trajectories, walking uphill and downhill, climbing over obstacles, and walking with partly amputated legs...|$|R
