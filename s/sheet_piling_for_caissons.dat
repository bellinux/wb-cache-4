40|$|In {{geotechnical}} practice frequently use is made {{of steel}} <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls <b>for</b> soil and/or water retaining constructions. High demands are made {{with respect to the}} deformations, in particular in urban surroundings. Often these walls are composed of V- or Z-shaped profiles, whereby both profiles have their specific advantages and disadvantages. A common used variant is a <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall composed of so called double If-profiles. A double If-profile is made up of two single U-profiles which are connected by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double If-profile is the rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of that, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall tends to deflect both in forward (lateral) direction as well as in sideway (transverse) direction. This phenomenon is called oblique bending, and it results in a loss of stiffness and strength (compared to a continuous wall) and thus larger deformations. Oblique bending goes together with slip in the free interlocks and a transverse deflection of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall relative to the soil body. Oblique bending might be influenced by the transverse bearing capacity of the soil, i. e. the soil reduces or even prevents the transverse deformation of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Besides, the shear stress in the free interlock possibly reduces oblique bending. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine the transverse bearing capacity of the soil. Therefore a three dimensional finite element model {{is made of}} a cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a dry excavation in front and without friction in the sliding interlocks. This is a 'worst case' model, i. e. if a <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall is modelled in this way, oblique bending can be observed most clearly. Emphasis has been put on the generation of an appropriate mesh which is also useful for further investigations regarding oblique bending. Use is made of the finite element system DIANA, version 6. 1.

40|$|Ports are {{civil works}} {{which have a}} major {{societal}} and economic importance. Quay structures are infrastructural elements of primary significance for the functioning of a port system. The ability to economically design quay structures with sufficient seismic resistance is therefore of great importance when situated {{in areas that are}} prone to earthquakes. Conventional seismic design is force-based i. e. that structures are designed to have sufficient capacity to withstand a pseudo-static seismic design force. This methodology is associated with no insight in the performance of the structure when exceeding the pseudo-static limit equilibrium state and uneconomic design due to the demand that the structure can resist a very high seismic design force without deforming. A more advanced alternative is Performance-Based Design (PBD) methodology. In this methodology the key design parameters for the seismic performance of structures are stress states and deformations of soil and structure, rather than just a seismic design force. Furthermore it recognizes that varying amounts of permanent deformations associated with different degrees of (repairable) damage are allowable. The present study is embedded in the topic of performance-based seismic design of quay structures. Typical quay types are gravity-based quay walls, <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay walls and pile-deck structures. The observed trend in seismic quay design is that gravity and <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> type structures (i. e. retaining walls) are associated with areas with zero to low seismicity while pile-deck structures are generally the preferred solution in areas with higher seismicity. This can be explained by more favourable seismic performance (i. e. more deformation capacity) of pile-deck structures compared to retaining walls. In line with this trend it is found that PBD methodology is developed to significant lesser extent for retaining walls (especially anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls) than <b>for</b> pile-deck structures. Therefore the present study focuses on performance-based seismic design of anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay walls. In the seismic design methodology there are generally three levels of seismic analysis available, i. e. simplified analysis (pseudo-static), simplified dynamic analysis and dynamic analysis. Simplified analysis of anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay walls is associated with conventional design methodology. Simplified dynamic analysis can be used to obtain a first estimate of permanent-displacement of a structure after exceeding limit equilibrium, based on an assumed failure mode. This type of analysis has to be made more suitable <b>for</b> anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay walls. In dynamic analysis the seismic behaviour of a structure can be simulated by means of finite element software. Experience has shown that it is desirable to consider <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay walls in a less conservative way in (preliminary) seismic design for which pseudo-static methodology is commonly applied. Therefore the general objective of the present study is to propose improvements on (simplified) seismic design methodologies <b>for</b> anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay walls by considering deformation behaviour. For this purpose a research methodology is developed in which pseudo-static, permanent-displacement and FE analysis are employed, calibrated with an experimental reference case that considers a typical anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay wall. The reference case is taken from a conference paper. It reports on a shake table test under centrifugal gravity which is performed on a scale model of an existing <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay wall with a batter pile anchor. The quay is situated in homogeneous soil that consists of coarse densified sand. Due to the soil condition liquefaction effects are prevented. Sequential seismic loading of increasing severity is applied during the shake table testing. Measurement results that are reported in the reference case paper comprise bending moments in the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall, normal forces in the anchor rod and horizontal displacements of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall. <b>For</b> simplified analysis a calibrated D-SHEET PILING model of the reference case anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay wall is created. Through an iterative pseudo-static calculation procedure in which D-SHEET PILING and reference case dynamic bending moment results are fitted, it is attempted to find a deformation-based seismic load reduction for structural forces in the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall that can be applied in pseudo-static design methodology. For simplified dynamic analysis an analytical limit equilibrium model is developed, based on the failure behaviour of the reference case. The goal of this model is that it can compute the critical acceleration of the anchored quay structure and estimate the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> forces at this critical state. These abilities are validated with PLAXIS 2 D and checked with the reference case measurements respectively. Six accelerograms in the reference case soil column, obtained with equivalent linear site-response analysis (with SHAKE 2000), are combined with the computed critical acceleration for permanent-displacement (sliding-block) analysis. For dynamic analysis a calibrated PLAXIS 2 D model of the reference case anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay wall is created. Dynamic performance of the PLAXIS 2 D model is validated with SHAKE 2000 by comparing site-response analysis results of both models. Pseudo-static and pseudo-dynamic calculations are applied to obtain the critical acceleration. Dynamic calculations with six bedrock motions are carried out to simulate the reference case experiment. PLAXIS 2 D calculation results are used to validate simplified and simplified dynamic analysis results and to gain insight in the seismic failure behaviour of the anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay wall. Approaches for (simplified) performance-based seismic analysis of a typical anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay wall are proposed {{as a result of the}} research. For pseudo-static methodology a deformation-based seismic load reduction for structural forces in the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall is proposed. For the present reference case it is concluded that a reduction in the range of 45 % to 50 % is allowable. For simplified dynamic analysis a limit equilibrium model is proposed to compute the critical acceleration of the present quay structure and to estimate <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> forces at this critical state. It is concluded that the ability of the limit equilibrium model is satisfactory. Although subjected to uncertainty, permanent-displacement analysis results indicate that the sliding-block analysis, originally developed for embankments, is possibly not suitable <b>for</b> anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay walls. <b>For</b> dynamic analysis it is concluded that PLAXIS 2 D is able to compute the reference case failure behaviour reasonably well, despite some computational setbacks. Complementary is the conclusion that PLAXIS 2 D pseudo-static approach proves to be suitable to determine the critical acceleration of an anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> structure in contrast to pseudo-dynamic approach which appears less suitable for that matter. In addition the performance-based design principle is linked to the present study so that an idea about the seismic performance limits of anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay walls in quantitative terms can be provided. As a result of the present study findings it is recommended to perform more extensive research on the ability of permanent-displacement analysis to evaluate the amount of sliding displacement of an anchored <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> quay wall. In line with this recommendation it is found that further research on site-response analysis is desirable in the application of simplified dynamic and dynamic analysis. In general it is recommended to create more seismic test cases with different setups for a broader validity of the present results, to develop a seismic test case for the Groningen earthquake situation, to add measurement instrumentation to new and existing structures for verification of research results and to make such (raw) measurement data available to the public.

40|$|Vibratory {{driving is}} today {{the most common}} {{installation}} method of <b>sheet</b> <b>piles.</b> The knowledge of the induced ground vibrations is however still deficient. This makes predictions of the vibration magnitudes difficult to carry out with good reliability. To avoid exceeding the limit values, resulting in stops of production, or that vibratory driven <b>sheet</b> <b>piles</b> are discarded <b>for</b> more costly solutions, a need for increased knowledge of the vibration process is imminent. With increased knowledge, a more reliable and practical prediction model can be developed.   The aim of this thesis is to analyze measured data from a field study to increase {{the understanding of the}} induced vibrations and their propagation through the soil. The field study was performed in Karlstad in May 2010, where a trial <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> prior to an extension of Karlstad Theatre was carried out. During the trial <b>sheet</b> <b>piling,</b> two triaxial geophones were mounted at the ground surface at two different distances from the <b>sheet</b> <b>piles,</b> to measure the vibration amplitude. The field test is associated with some limitations. Only four <b>sheet</b> <b>piles</b> were driven, with one measurement per <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Some measurements were less successful and some parameters had to be assumed. This limits the accuracy but still provides some interesting results. Another aim is to compare the measured values to existing models for predicting vibrations from <b>piling</b> and <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> operations. There are today several prediction models available, which however often provide too crude estimations or alternatively are too advanced to be incorporated in practical use. Two basic empirical prediction models are compared to the measured values in Karlstad, where the first is one of the earliest and most well known models and the other is a later development of the first model. The purpose of this comparison is to evaluate these models to {{contribute to the development of}} a new prediction model. The results show that the earlier model greatly overestimates the vibration magnitude while the later developed model provides a better estimation.   A literature study is performed to gain a theoretical background to the problem of ground vibrations and how they are related to the method of vibratory driving of <b>sheet</b> <b>piles.</b> The analysis considering the field study and prediction models is mainly performed by using MATLAB to obtain different graphical presentations of the vibration signals. The conclusions that can be drawn from the results are that the focus of vibration analysis should not always be the vertical vibration components. Horizontal movements of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> might be introduced, e. g. by the configuration of the clamping device, which generates additional vibrations in horizontal directions. The soil characteristics influence the magnitude of the vibrations. As the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> reaches a stiffer soil layer, the vibration magnitude increases.

This MSc. thesis in particular, focuses on a crucial link in the vibration transfer chain: the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil interface, which {{is also one of}} the least documented. The aim of this thesis is first, to carry out a full-scale field test consisting in the monitoring of <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> and ground vibrations during <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibratory driving. And second, to analyze a selected portion of the collected data with focus on the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer. Both aspects of the thesis work aim, more generally, to contribute to the understanding of ground vibration generation under vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> driving. The full-scale field study was performed in Solna in May 2013. It consisted in the vibratory driving of seven <b>sheet</b> <b>piles,</b> out of which three were fitted with accelerometers. During the driving, ground vibrations were measured by accelerometers, the closest ones placed only 0. 5 m from the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> line. The design and installation of the soil instrumentation was innovative in as much as accelerometers were not only set on the ground surface but also at three different depths (~ 3 m, 5 m and 6 m). The analysis presented in this thesis is primarily a comparison between <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibrations and ground vibrations measured 0. 5 m from the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> line. The principal aspects considered in the comparison are: the influence of penetration through different soil layers, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer efficiency, the frequency content of <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> and soil vibrations, and differences between toe- and shaft-generated vibrations. The main conclusions from this study are:  Most of the vibration loss occurs in the near field: 90 - 99 % of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibration magnitude was dispersed within 0. 5 m from the driven <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Moreover, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer efficiency was reduced <b>for</b> higher <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> acceleration levels and higher frequencies.  The soil characteristics strongly influence the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibration levels.

40|$|Iowa Highway Research Board Project TR- 568 was {{initiated}} in January 2007 {{to investigate the}} use of steel <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> as an alternative foundation component for Low Volume Road (LVR) bridges. A total of 14 different sites were initially investigated in several counties as potential candidates {{for the construction of}} demonstration projects utilizing steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> abutments. Based on site conditions, three sites were selected for demonstration projects; these are located in Black Hawk, Boone, and Tama Counties. Each of the demonstration projects utilizes a different experimental abutment system. Steel <b>sheet</b> <b>piling,</b> typically used <b>for</b> retaining structures in the United States, has been used as bearing <b>piles</b> in Europe <b>for</b> the past 50 years and is a potential alternative for use as the primary component in LVR bridge substructures. To investigate the viability of axially-loaded <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> abutments, a demonstration project was constructed in Black Hawk County, Iowa. The project involved construction of a 40 ft, single-span bridge utilizing axially-loaded steel <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> as the primary foundation component. The site chosen for the project consisted of primarily silty clays underlain by shallow bedrock into which the <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> was driven. An instrumentation system (consisting of strain gages, deflection transducers, earth pressure cells, and piezometers) was installed on the bridge for obtaining live load test data as well as long term performance data. Live load testing of the bridge structure was performed on November 3, 2008 by placing two loaded trucks (approximately 24 ton each) at various locations on the bridge and recording data. Maximum axial stresses occurring in the piles were approximately 0. 5 ksi and were comparable to estimates made by analysis for a design lane-load distribution width of 10 ft. Flexural stresses, in general, were significantly less than those estimated by analysis and maximum values were approximately 0. 2 ksi. Earth pressures recorded during live load testing (with maxima of approximately 100 psf) were also significantly lower than earth pressures estimated by analysis. These results suggest the method of analysis for lateral earth pressures applied to the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall was conservative. Long-term monitoring of the bridge from November 2008 through February 2009 was also performed; the datalogging system was damaged by flooding in March 2009 and subsequent long-term monitoring was terminated. Variations in earth pressure over time were observed with the largest variations in earth pressure occurring behind the abutment cap. The earth pressures experienced cycles that varied in magnitude from 50 psf to 1500 psf, suggesting long-term loading due to freeze/thaw cycles of the soil and the thermal deformation of the superstructure elements may be the critical factors in the design of <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> abutment and backfill retaining systems rather than vehicular live loads. The demonstration projects in Boone and Tama Counties were designed using a geosynthetically reinforced soil backfill with a steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> backfill retention abutment system. Each of the bridge superstructures is supported by spread footings bearing on the reinforced soil mass abutment systems. The bridge superstructure in Boone County is a 100 ft long, three span J 30 C- 87 continuous concrete slab bridge while the superstructure for Tama County utilizes two 89 ft railroad flatcars bolted together. Structural monitoring systems (including strain gages, earth pressure cells, and piezometers) were developed for load testing and long-term monitoring of these projects as well. Construction of the project in Boone County was completed in fall 2009 and live load testing was subsequently performed on November 13, 2009. Maximum flexural stresses experienced in the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> elements were 0. 08 ksi and were significantly lower than estimated by analysis. Vertical and horizontal earth pressures in the backfill (with maxima of 410 psf and 50 psf, respectively) were also lower than expected, suggesting a conservative design approach. Construction of the project in Tama County was completed in August 2010 with subsequent load testing performed in October 2010.

The {{diversion}} of sewer, river embankment, and steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> cofferdam <b>for</b> construction of the new lock were all complete by May 1932. The embankment was constructed primarily of tipped chalk, faced on the seaward side with concrete blocks. Dock construction required excavation of approximately [...] of material, primarily by dragline excavator, much of which was used to fill {{other areas of the}} newly enclosed land. Spoil and slag from Scunthorpe was also used as fill on the reclaimed land. The new 45 ft lock was 240 ft long total with three gates. It was built on 12 in square timber piles, supporting a square bottomed concrete lock pit. 'Blows', (underground springs) were encountered when excavating the lock's west wall foundations, undermining the work, and causing the newly laid concrete to crack. Work was delayed by remedial work to counter these springs, consisting of sunken centrifugal pumps used to draw of the water, temporarily reducing the local level of the water table. The lock was faced with granite. A pipe subway lined with cast iron segmental rings ran under part of the lock, carrying services (hydraulic, water, electricity). The initially installed gates were of oak, operated by hydraulically activated chains. The new east pier was 500 ft long and constructed of timber, on the west side part of the old pier was removed and a new 175 ft pier section added, meeting the old at a [...] "V".|$|R

40|$|Bored {{concrete}} piles {{have been used}} widely on commercial developments in London for about the last 50 years. The life of a commercial building is between 25 – 30 years and, as each building is demolished and rebuilt, the piles from the previous buildings remain in the ground causing obstructions to the new foundations. This paper describes a preliminary study to explore the viability of <b>sheet</b> <b>piled</b> foundations as a genuine alternative to cast in situ {{concrete piles}} {{and all of the}} complications inherent in their construction and the obstruction they create to subsequent foundations. If it is possible to use steel piles as foundations they can be easily removed, recycled and will not cause obstructions for future developments. However, individual <b>sheet</b> <b>piles</b> have relatively low capacity when axially loaded and it is therefore necessary to consider a <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> group in conjunction with a pilecap, which can be considered a hybrid foundation; a combination of shallow (pilecap) and deep (<b>sheet</b> <b>pile).</b> A short series of centrifuge tests is reported in which model <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> groups in over-consolidated clay were loaded axially whilst vertical displacements were measured.

The proposed procedure employs inverse first order reliability method {{to obtain the}} design penetration depth and section modulus of the steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall in order that {{the reliability of the}} wall against failure modes must meet a desired level of safety. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the effect of uncertainties in design parameters on the reliability of cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls.

Two limit states, viz., rotational and flexural failure of <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall are considered.

40|$|For {{over three}} {{quarters}} of a century steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are applied in geotechnical practice. For example in quay walls and construction pits in urban surroundings. Steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are often composed of so called double U-profiles. These profiles consist of two single U profiles fixed in the common interlock by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double U-profile is an asymmetric cross-section which can lead to a rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of this, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall tends to deflect both forward (lateral) and sideways (transverse). This phenomenon is called oblique bending. As a result of oblique bending, the strength and lateral stiffness of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall may be decreased considerably up to values of 60 % to 70 % compared to a continuous <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall. This leads to uneconomical designs. Four different methods to reduce oblique bending in a steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall have been studied: 1) Cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall in dry sand. 2) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a fix of the horizontal displacement at the top. 3) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a capping beam on top. 4) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> with the sliding interlock welded during the excavation. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine which method is able to give the highest resistance against oblique bending. Therefore calculations have been made with a 3 D-finite element model (DIANA) of a dry excavation of a sand body in front of a cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall consisting of double U-profiles. The lower limit of the strength and stiffness is obtained when no transverse bending moment is activated and the in plane deformation is free. The maximum or upper limit strength and stiffness is derived if oblique bending is prevented by fixing the free interlocks (no in plane deformation). Depending on the loading conditions, the stiffness varies from 0. 49 to 1 time the maximum stiffness. The strength appeared to vary from 0. 59 to 1 time the maximum strength. 3 D-finite element calculations have been made for the mentioned four methods to reduce oblique bending. From the 3 D calculations it followed that the use of these methods may increase the strength and stiffness up to about 0. 8 times the maximum value for strength and stiffness. Welding of the interlock during excavation gave the highest reduction of oblique bending. Foundation Engineering GroupHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|During {{vibratory}} <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> {{quite often}} the soil near the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall will settle. In many cases {{this is not}} a problem. For situations with houses, pipelines, roads or railroads at relative short distance these settlements may not be acceptable. The purpose of the research described in this thesis is to develop a model that is capable of predicting the settlement due to vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> with reasonable accuracy. The research is limited to <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> in sand. First a description is given of the processes during vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>piling.</b> From this description the main mechanisms that are responsible for the settlement during vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> are identified. These are the densification of the soil and the displacement of a soil volume due to the volume of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Presently available models to predict the settlement are described and commented. It is concluded that all models possess some shortcomings. As densification {{is one of the main}} causes for the settlement much attention is paid to the behaviour of sand during cyclic loading. Available models to predict the densification for large numbers of loading cycles are described. Attention is paid to the combined effect of generation and dissipation of excess pore pressure. To supplement the findings from the literature a series of cyclic triaxial tests is performed to clarify some aspects. These tests show that the history of the sand greatly influences the behaviour during cyclic loading. A numerical model is developed that takes into account the different sub processes during vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> (interface behaviour <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> - soil, propagation of vibrations, densification, dissipation excess pore pressure and summation of the local volume strains). For the propagation and the densification different options are considered and implemented. The selected constitutive models are extended to handle both undrained and drained soil behaviour. To validate the developed model a well instrumented field test is designed and executed. This test is performed at Raamsdonksveer, The Netherlands. Measured data are the vibrations near the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile,</b> the pore pressure, the local densification, the settlement at surface and at two depths and the change in cone resistance. The measured data are processed and interpreted. In addition to the results of this test, measured surface settlements from a number of projects are used as well to compare predictions with the developed model with actual behaviour. A reasonable agreement between measured and predicted settlement is found. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
