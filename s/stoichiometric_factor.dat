40|$|The aim of a {{volumetric}} titration is to {{find the}} analyte concentration from the consumed volume of titrant and its molarity. For calculations, the use of stoichiometric factors is compulsory if the concentration is expressed in moles/liter. When analyte and titrant react with each other during the titration, the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>factor</b> is just the stoichiometric coefficients ratio for both in the chemical equation. It happens so in the titration of HCl with sodium carbonate. Sometimes, analyte and titrant take part in a chain of reactions in which the former is chemically converted to a titrable species. This is the case of Cu(II) titration with thiosulfate: Cu(II) ions react first with excess iodide to yield I 2 which is titrated with a thiosulfate solution of known molarity. In these instances, a relationship between the moles of analyte and moles of titrant should be established as the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>factor.</b> In this exercise, the data from a volumetric titration are converted finally to mass percent of analyte in the sample.

Both bath composition and deposition potential were varied {{over a wide}} range. Large variations of the mercury content of the films can be realized by appropriate choice of the deposition potential while for a given deposition potential the mercury content increases steeply with increasing mercury concentration in the bath and tends towards a limiting value. The deposition potential is therefore the chief parameter permitting a predetermined film composition to be established. For a series of films deposited at potentials between - 0. 5 and - 1. 0 V vs. SCE, the lattice parameter a of the cubic ternary compound obtained from the X-ray diffractograms (XRD) gives a <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>factor</b> x matching closely the mercury content (at. %) found by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA).

We have calculated the free energy barriers and reaction energies at 25, 80, and 260 0 C in the gas phase and in aqueous solution for a broad range of reactions that might, potentially, be involved in amine/nitroxide cycling, as well as several novel pathways proposed as part of the present work, including that of N-alkyl hindered amine light stabilizer activation. We find that most of the literature nitroxide regeneration cycles should be discarded on either kinetic or thermodynamic grounds; some are even inconsistent with existing experimental observations.

An unknown 50 mL sample is titrated using sequentially the indicators phenolphthalein and methyl orange.

We show that the choice of reference enthalpies {{plays a crucial role}} in the assessment. Due to the large <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>factors</b> involved, errors of various origin are strongly amplified. Inconsistent reference data are avoided by computing reference energies at the CCSD(T) /CBS level. These are compared to results for a variety of standard DFs. Two different versions of London dispersion corrections (DFT-D 2 and DFT-D 3) are applied and found to be very significant. The most accurate results are obtained with B 2 GPPLYP-D 2 (MAD= 0. 4 kcal*mol - 1), B 2 PLYP-D 2 (MAD= 0. 5 kcal*mol - 1) and B 97 -D 2 (MAD= 0. 9 kcal*mol - 1) methods. Dispersion corrections not only improve the computed BSR energies but also diminish the accuracy differences between the DFs. The previous DFT-D 2 version performs better due to error compensation of medium-range correlation effects between the semi-classical and the density-based description.

Caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and chlorogenic acid with or without 2 -mercaptoethanol (ME), {{as a substitute for}} GSH, was investigated by the induction period (IP) method for polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) initiated by thermal decomposition of 2, 2 '-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN, a source of alkyl radicals, R.) and benzoyl peroxide (BPO, a source of peroxy radicals, PhCOO.) using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Upon PhCOO. radical scavenging, the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>factors</b> (n, number of free radical trapped by one mole of antioxidant) for caffeic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid and chlorogenic acid were 2. 4, 1. 8, 1. 7 and 0. 9, whereas upon R. radical scavenging, the corresponding values were 1. 3, 1. 2, 1. 0 and 0. 8, respectively. Antioxidants with n values close to 2 suggest the stepwise formation of semiquinone radicals and quinones. By contrast, those with n values close to 1 suggest the formation of dimers after single-electron oxidation, possibly due to recombination of corresponding aryloxy radicals. The ratio of the rate constant of inhibition to that of propagation (kinh/kp) declined in the order chlorogenic acid > p-coumaric acid > ferulic acid > caffeic acid. The ratio of the observed IP for the phenolcarboxylic acid/ 2 -mercapto-ethanol (ME) mixture (1 : 1 molar ratio) (A) to the calculated IP (the simple sum of phenol acid antioxidant and ME) (B) was investigated. Upon R. scavenging, the caffeic acid or p-coumaric acid/ME mixture was A/B > 1, particularly the former was 1. 2, suggesting a synergic effect.

40|$|Despite {{the wealth}} of {{published}} data on the beneficial or detrimental effects of silver, lead, sulfide, and carbonaceous matter on the rate of gold cyanidation at an anode or by dissolved oxygen, the lack of comparative studies on relative effects has hampered rationalisation {{of the role of}} these activators or passivators of gold. In the present study, the published rate data per unit surface area of gold, silver, and gold–silver alloys based on electrochemical or chemical dissolution of rotating discs or foils of constant surface area in aerated cyanide solutions at ambient temperatures are analysed {{on the basis of the}} Levich equation. The current status of the reaction mechanism is also reviewed and updated on the basis of species distribution and potential–pH diagrams, <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>factors,</b> and interim chemical species of gold(I), silver(I), and lead(II). The anodic peak potentials of reported voltammograms closely follow the potential–pH lines of Au(I) /Au(0) and Pb(II) /Pb(0) couples. Despite the formation of stable complexes between lead(II), nitrate, and hydroxide ions, the total calculated soluble lead(II) in alkaline solutions of pH range 10 – 11 saturated with lead hydroxide is shown to be < 0. 1 g/m 3. A comparison of the reported diffusion coefficients of cyanide ions and dissolved oxygen with the values based on the Levich plots of reported rates reveals the rate-controlling stoichiometric M/CN or M/O 2 molar ratios. The difference between some of these ratios and the generally accepted ratios of M/CN = 1 / 2 and M/O 2 = 1 / 0. 5 or 1 / 0. 25 based on the formation of M(CN) 2 −, H 2 O 2 or OH− in the overall cyanidation reaction is attributed to the oxidation of cyanide to cyanate and passivation due to the formation of gold hydroxides/oxides. The alloyed or dissolved silver and lead eliminate passivation due to the involvement of mixed hydroxo–cyano complexes of silver and lead ions in the surface reaction. Gold dissolution by oxygen in cyanide-rich solutions is limited by oxygen diffusion, but enhanced by the presence of a low concentration of sodium sulfide due to the involvement of hydrosulfide ion in the surface reaction. However, excess lead or sulfide retards gold cyanidation due to surface blockage by metallic lead, lead hydroxide, or due to passivation by Au 2 S/S. Even low concentrations of hydrosulfide passivate gold–silver alloys due to the formation of Ag 2 S. This can be eliminated by adding stoichiometric quantities of lead(II) to precipitate sulfide as PbS. Large stoichiometric ratios of O 2 /M for the cyanidation of graphite coated gold appears to be a result of the enhanced oxidation of cyanide by oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, leading to a cyanide deficiency at the surface and passivation of gold by hydroxide/oxide. The presence of excess cyanide or lead(II) does not override this effect...|$|R

Numerous experiments – both at the laboratory scale and large scale – have been performed to optimise cementation as part of zinc sulfate production, by studying the effects of parameters such as temperature, the type and concentration of impurities and the quantity of zinc dust used. These studies have employed both technical zinc sulphate solutions (working solutions) and solutions with much lower concentrations of heavy metals (pharmaceutical solutions). The present study primarily concentrated on investigating the effect of metals on the cementation of nickel, which is almost always contained in the starting solution in the large scale production of zinc sulfate. In accordance with the literature, the results showed that the cementation of nickel can be described as a first order reaction. Moreover, there was significant correlation between the rate constants for nickel cementation and the stochiometric proportions in the solution. This made it possible {{for the first time to}} eliminate two <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>factors</b> from the rate constants which unambiguously describe the concentrations in the solution. In practice, this signifies that the initial conditions in the solution are of decisive importance for the course of nickel cementation. Thus the course of nickel separation is only complete and adequately rapid when the concentrations of lead, cadmium and copper in the starting solution, at the beginning of the cementation process, are high and their ratios to the nickel concentration are also high (about 10). If these conditions are fulfilled, and other parameters (such as temperature, pH and stirring rate) are kept constant, the cementation is only influenced by the zinc dust/metal ratio in the starting solution, which must always be greater than 2. Evaluation of the temperature dependence of the rate constants found that the activation energy for nickel cementation was 49. 41 kJ/mol. This indicates that the rate of nickel separation from zinc sulfate solutions in the technical cementation process is not determined by diffusion, but is determined, or strongly influenced, by a chemically or electrochemically controlled reaction. In addition, practical possibilities are listed for reliable quantitative removal of nickel and for avoiding overdosage with zinc dust. The cementation product produced during zinc lye purification is a sludge, in which analysis of the structure and composition of the individual substance phases is not possible. For this reason, an attempt was made to simulate the cementation process by using thermodynamic calculations. This was intended to describe the basic behaviour of the metals and the possible composition of the cementation products. In this manner, it was possible to describe the effect of the formation of intermetallic phases and the coupled sequence of the separation of the metals during cementation...|$|R
40|$|A proper thermal {{management}} strategy {{is needed to}} maintain uniform temperature distribution and derive optimal performance in high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFC). In HT-PEMFCs, {{more than half of}} the chemical energy is converted into thermal energy during the electrochemical generation of electrical power. We investigate the viability of three heat removal strategies: (a) using cooling plates through which cathode air is passed in excess of stoichiometric requirement for the purpose of heat removal, (b) using forced convection partly in conjunction with cooling plates, and (c) using forced convection alone for heat removal. Calculations, partly done using computational fluid dynamics simulations, for a 1 kWe HT-PEMFC stack, which is suitable for scooter type of transport applications, show that a combination of excess <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>factor</b> and forced draft appears to provide the optimal strategy for {{thermal management}} of high temperature PEM fuel cells. With proper cooling strategy, the temperature variations within the cell may be reduced to about 20 K over most of the cell and to about 50 K in isolated spots...|$|E
40|$|Reaction {{kinetics}} of betanin and its aglycone betanidin towards peroxyl radicals {{generated from}} the azo-initiated oxidation of methyl linoleate in methanol, and of a heterogeneous aqueous/soybean phosphatidylcholine liposomal system, were studied by monitoring formation of linoleic acid hydroperoxides and consumption of the pigments. Betanin was a weak retarder in methanol, and an effective chain breaking antioxidant in the liposomal model, indicating that kinetic solvent effects and partition in lipid bilayers may affect its activity. Betanidin behaved as a chain terminating antioxidant in both models. Kinetic parameters characterizing peroxyl radical-scavenging activity showed that betanidin was more effective than betanin, {{in terms of both}} radical-scavenging rate constant and <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>factor,</b> with effectiveness of the same order as vitamin E under comparable conditions. Products identified by spectrophotometric and HPLC techniques indicated reaction of the glucose-substituted monophenol and ortho-diphenol moieties of betanin and betanidin, respectively, and suggested mechanisms of the antioxidant activity. Either betanin or betanidin incorporated in liposomes with -tocopherol, had additive effects, supporting partition of the pigments in the bilayer and lipoperoxyl radical reduction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The radical-scavenging {{activities}} of the flavanones hesperetin and hesperidin were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) monitoring of the polymerization of methyl methacrylate initiated by 2, 2 ’-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN, an Rñ radical) or benzoyl peroxide (BPO, a PhCOOñ radical) at 70 ÆC under nearly anaerobic conditions. Their <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>factor</b> (number of free radicals trapped by one mole of antioxidant moiety (n)) and {{the ratio of the}} rate constant of inhibition to that of propagation (kinh/kp) were determined and compared with that for trolox. The n value declined in the order trolox (2. 0) > hesperetin (0. 8) > hesperidin (0. 2) in the AIBN system, whereas it declined in the order hesperetin (0. 9) > trolox (0. 1) > hesperidin (0. 0) in the BPO system. The kinh/kp value declined in the order hesperidin (195) > hesperetin (33) > trolox (12) in the AIBN system, whereas it declined in the order hesperidin (362) > trolox (127) > hesperetin (18) in the BPO system. The n value of about 1 for hesperetin with a relatively small kinh/kp value suggests th...|$|E
40|$|Concentrations and {{ratios of}} {{nutrients}} in Jiaozhou Bay, China, have changed {{much in the}} past decades, with trends indicating an increase in nitrogen {{and a decrease in}} silicate. Statistical analysis has shown that the long-term variations of nutrients are associated with agricultural activities, precipitation, and anthropogenic <b>factors.</b> <b>Stoichiometric</b> calculations indicate that the nutrient structure has become more and more unbalanced. There has been almost no possibility for nitrogen limitation since the 1980 s, the probability of P limitation has increased, and the probability of Si limitation has also increased markedly from the 1980 s to the 1990 s. As a consequence of changes in nutrient structure, a decrease in the abundance of net phytoplankton was evident, whereas total chlorophyll a levels have remained roughly unchanged at around 3. 55 mu g/L. Thus, it is likely that smaller species have taken the niche vacated by the larger species. Changes in phytoplankton size and species composition may ultimately lead to various functional and structural changes at the system level...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of ecological stoichiometry {{has centered on}} organisms and their interactions, with less emphasis on the meaning or value of a comprehensive ecosystem stoichiometry at larger scales. Here we develop a conceptual framework that relates internal processes and exogenous factors in spatially- and temporally-linked ecosystems. This framework emerges from a functional view of ecosystem stoichiometry rooted in understanding the causes and consequences of relative stoichiometric balance, defined as the balance between ratios of resource supply and demand. We begin by modifying a graphical model based on resource ratio competition theory that relates resource supply and demand to ecosystem processes. This approach identified mechanisms, or stoichiometric schemes, through which ecosystems respond to variable resource supply. We expand this view by considering the effects of exogenous factors other then resource supply that comprise a stoichiometric template that influences stoichiometric balance within ecosystems. We then describe a number of examples of patterns in organismal stoichiometry in several types of ecosystems that illustrate <b>stoichiometric</b> schemes and <b>factors</b> that impinge directly on stoichiometri...|$|R
40|$|Gas blowout {{occurred}} during drilling may cause catastrophic environmental hazards and economic losses. It is thus {{one of the}} important tasks to accurately determine the gas blowout volume so that an effective rescue plan can be worked out in case of gas blowout. In this paper, a numerical method for estimating the gas blowout volume was presented based on the Bernoulli Equation and the corresponding software was programmed. In the process of numerical estimation, the velocity distribution of the blowout flame characterized by the axisymmetric laminar flow was investigated through an analysis of the dynamic flowing features of the gas gusher, and the relationship between the gas production of a well and the height of the blowout flame was then analyzed with the Bernoulli Equation to obtain the numerical results of the gas blowout volume. The results were then compared with those laboratory measurements, and the software was revised based on the comparisons. Some conclusions were drawn. First, when the spout shape of a gusher is constant, the gas production is proportional to the height of the blowout flame, and inversely proportional to the gas kinematic viscosity, the <b>stoichiometric</b> ratio <b>factor</b> and the oxygen concentration. Second, the errors between the results estimated using the revised software and the laboratory measurements are within the allowable range, and the software can automatically generate a report. In a word, the method and software presented in this paper can be an effective technique for preparing a sound and safe rescue plan in case of gas blowout, and is of great significance in relieving the hazards of a well with uncontrolled blowout.
