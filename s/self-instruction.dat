On its main gimmick, the holes in the stars meant to show the constellation when held in front of a light, he notes that, as the size of the holes marked correspond to the magnitude of the stars, a quite realistic depiction of the constellation is provided. Ian Ridpath mostly concurs. He describes the device as an [...] "attractive feature", but notes that, due to the light at the time being provided primarily by candles, many cards likely burned up due to carelessness when trying to hold them in front of the flame. He notes three other attempts to use the same gimmick—Franz Niklaus König's Atlas céleste (1826), Friedrich Braun's Himmels-Atlas in transparenten Karten (1850), and Otto Möllinger's Himmelsatlas (1851), but states that they lack Urania's Mirrors artistry.|$|E

2500|$|Karl Knaths {{was born}} October 21, 1891, in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. His parents were Otto Julius Knaths and Maria Theresa Knaths. Shortly after Knaths's birth {{the family moved}} to Portage, Wisconsin where he spent his {{childhood}} years. When he was in his late teens his father died and he became apprenticed to his mother's brother, George Dietrich, in the baking trade. Although he had begun making sketches, he had no art instruction and little time for <b>self-instruction.</b> While attending Portage High School he met the local author, Zona Gale. She encouraged his interest and, upon his graduation in 1910, both convinced his uncle to release him from apprenticeship and introduced him to [...] of the Milwaukee Art Institute. During the next year he studied art at the Institute. He obtained the job by which he supported himself when Gale introduced him to Laura Sherry, the director of the Wisconsin Players. Despite his youth and inexperience, Sherry took him on as caretaker of the playhouse and one of its set designers. In 1911, on advice from Gale and Craft, Knaths began studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. There, he mainly supported himself as janitor's assistant but when the 1913 Armory Show came to town he landed a job at the show as one of the guards. The show was his first substantial exposure to European modernism and he later reported that the experience both confused and awed him. Uncomfortable with most of the work on display, he found much to like in the works of Cézanne, particularly the blocks of muted color out of which he built his compositions.|$|E
60|$|As {{suggesting}} a final reason for making education {{a process of}} <b>self-instruction,</b> and by consequence a process of pleasurable instruction, we may advert to the fact that, in proportion as it is made so, is there a probability {{that it will not}} cease when schooldays end. As long as the acquisition of knowledge is rendered habitually repugnant, so long will there be a prevailing tendency to discontinue it when free from the coercion of parents and masters. And when the acquisition of knowledge has been rendered habitually gratifying, then will there be as prevailing a tendency to continue, without superintendence, that self-culture previously carried on under superintendence. These results are inevitable. While the laws of mental association remain true--while men dislike the things and places that suggest painful recollections, and delight in those which call to mind by-gone pleasures--painful lessons will make knowledge repulsive, and pleasurable lessons will make it attractive. The men to whom in boyhood information came in dreary tasks along with threats of punishment, and who were never led into habits of independent inquiry, are unlikely to be students in after years; while those to whom it came in the natural forms, at the proper times, and who remember its facts as not only interesting in themselves, but as the occasions of a long series of gratifying successes, are likely to continue through life that <b>self-instruction</b> commenced in youth.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} pain {{coping strategies}} used by children during dental treatment. Design: A single cross-sectional survey with a questionnaire {{carried out in}} 199 children aged 10 - 17 years. Methods: The Waldron/Varni Pediatric Pain Coping Inventory was used. Interpretation of the results was preceded by exploratory factor analysis and Varimax orthogonal rotation. Statistical analysis of results concerning coping strategies was performed with descriptive statistics methods: the mean, standard deviation and median. Quantitative parameters were compared with the two-sample t-test, Mann-Whitney and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. All the tests were performed {{at a level of}} significance of α = 0. 05. Results: The results were interpreted based on analysis of 25 items structured into five factors of the modified questionnaire, revealing strategies used by children to cope with pain and perceived as effective by them. The most frequently reported strategies were cognitive <b>self-instructions.</b> Younger children preferred the use of social support; passive relaxation and cognitive <b>self-instructions</b> were preferred by girls and boys, respectively. Hospitalized children needed social support more often than outpatients, and so did children undergoing dental treatment with parental accompaniment. Conclusion: Differences in the use of coping strategies were noted, particularly with regard to children's age category, gender, hospitalization and parents being present during treatment. Routine recommendations of how to effectively cope with pain during dental treatment without considering the child’s individuality and particular situation are not advisable...|$|R

6000|$|The {{greatest}} {{defect in}} our programmes {{of education is}} entirely overlooked. While much is being done in the detailed improvement of our systems in respect both of matter and manner, the most pressing desideratum {{has not yet been}} even recognised as a desideratum. To prepare the young for the duties of life is tacitly admitted to be the end which parents and schoolmasters should have in view; and happily, the value of the things taught, and the goodness of the methods followed in teaching them, are now ostensibly judged by their fitness to this end. The propriety of substituting for an exclusively classical training, a training in which the modern languages shall have a share, is argued on this ground. The necessity of increasing the amount of science is urged for like reasons. But though some care is taken to fit youth of both sexes for society and citizenship, no care whatever is taken to fit them for the position of parents. While it is seen that for the purpose of gaining a livelihood, an elaborate preparation is needed, it appears to be thought that for the bringing up of children, no preparation whatever is needed. While many years are spent by a boy in gaining knowledge of which the chief value is that it constitutes [...] "the education of a gentleman;" [...] and while many years are spent by a girl in those decorative acquirements which fit her for evening parties; not an hour is spent by either in preparation for that gravest of all responsibilities--the management of a family. Is it that this responsibility is but a remote contingency? On the contrary, it is sure to devolve on nine out of ten. Is it that the discharge of it is easy? Certainly not: of all functions which the adult has to fulfil, this is the most difficult. Is it that each may be trusted by <b>self-instruction</b> to fit himself, or herself, for the office of parent? No: not only is the need for such <b>self-instruction</b> unrecognised, but the complexity of the subject renders it the one of all others in which <b>self-instruction</b> is least likely to succeed. No rational plea can be put forward for leaving the Art of Education out of our curriculum. Whether as bearing on the happiness of parents themselves, or whether as affecting the characters and lives of their children and remote descendants, we must admit that a knowledge of the right methods of juvenile culture, physical, intellectual, and moral, is a knowledge of extreme importance. This topic should be the final one in the course of instruction passed through by each man and woman. As physical maturity is marked by the ability to produce offspring, so mental maturity is marked by the ability to train those offspring. The subject which involves all other subjects, and therefore the subject in which education should culminate, is the Theory and Practice of Education.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{evidence}} that cognitive deficits remain stable over time is reliable and abundant, {{much of the research}} in this domain focuses on methods to improve attention and working memory. Efforts to improve learning ability in individuals with schizophrenia using a high- versus low-reward condition and an instruction-absent or instruction-present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance, highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase cognitive performance. Training individuals with schizophrenia to alter their thinking, attention, and language behaviors by verbalizing tasks, engaging in cognitive rehearsal, giving <b>self-instructions,</b> giving coping statements to the self to handle failure, and providing self-reinforcement for success, significantly improves performance on recall tasks. This type of training, known as self-instructional (SI) training, produced benefits such as lower number of nonsense verbalizations and improved recall while distracted.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of a cognitive behavior modification self-instructional training procedure on the reading comprehension performances of fifth grade students with reading comprehension difficulties. Twelve fifth grade students nominated by their classroom teacher as adequate decoders but poor comprehenders served as the subject pool from which the selection of subjects was made. Students were screened to establish adequate decoding skills and below average reading comprehension ability. Additionally, on the basis of the screening process, students were judged to have average intellectual functioning and an adequate receptive vocabulary. Of the students meeting the above criteria, four were randomly selected to participate in the study. A modified multiple baseline design across subjects was utilized to analyze the effects of self-instructional training on reading comprehension. Baseline data was collected according to Homer and Baer's (1978) multiple-probe technique. Self-instructional training was sequentially introduced across subjects. At the completion of the training sequence, posttraining assessments of reading comprehension were made for each subject. Self-instructional training was modeled after Meichenbaum and Goodman's (1971) cognitive behavior modification self-instructional training procedure. Training consisted of five, approximately thirty minute, sessions. Procedural steps of the cognitive behavioral paradigm were progressively introduced over a training period of five days. During training, subjects were individually taught to verbalize <b>self-instructions</b> while reading. The <b>self-instructions</b> consisted of self-statements to be utilized by the subject in comprehending a reading passage. Functional analysis of the treatment effects indicated an increase in reading comprehension performances for three of the four subjects after they were exposed to the training sequence. Only one subject's performance indicated maintenance of the treatment effects over time. All subjects demonstrated individual clinically significant posttraining performances. However, the overall average increase in each subject's posttraining performance did not reach clinical significance. As a result of the data analysis, it was concluded that self-instructional training can be an effective procedure in improving the reading comprehension performances of fifth grade poor comprehenders. Discussion of the obtained results and recommendations for future research were presented. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
40|$|Autonomous {{systems are}} the result of {{self-sustaining}} processes of constitution of an identity under precarious circumstances. They may transit through different modes of dynamical engagement with their environment, from committed ongoing coping to open susceptibility to external demands. This paper discusses these two statements and presents examples of models of autonomous behaviour using methods in evolutionary robotics. A model of an agent capable of issuing <b>self-instructions</b> demonstrates the fragility of modelling autonomy as a function rather than as a property of a system’s organization. An alternative model of behavioural preference based on homeostatic adaptation avoids this problem by establishing a mutual constraining between lower-level processes (neural dynamics and sensorimotor interaction) and higher-level metadynamics (experience-dependent, homeostatic triggering of local plasticity and re-organization). The results of these models are lessons about how strong autonomy should be approached: neither as a function, nor as a matter of external vs. internal determination...|$|R

6000|$|The Hamlet of Fechter, {{which rose}} ghostlike {{out of the}} gulf of the past, and cloudily possessed the stage where the Hamlet of Mme.

It was romantic as Shakespeare himself was romantic, in an elder sense of the word, and not romanticistic as Dumas was romanticistic. It was, therefore, the most {{realistic}} Hamlet ever yet seen, because the most naturally poetic. Mme.

Bernhardt's Hamlet, as in his, nothing was trusted to chance, or [...] "inspiration." [...] Good or bad, what one saw was what was meant to be seen. When Fechter played Edmond Dantes or Claude Melnotte, he put reality into those preposterous inventions, and in Hamlet even his alien accent helped him vitalize the part; it might be held to be nearer the Elizabethan accent than ours; and after all, you said Hamlet was a foreigner, and in your high content with what he gave you did not mind its being in a broken vessel. When he challenged the ghost with [...] "I call thee keeng, father, rawl-Dane," [...] you Would hardly have had the erring utterance bettered.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{cognitive}} mechanisms {{have been proposed}} to apprehend the maintenance of delusional beliefs, a typical feature of schizophrenia. However, none of these mechanisms {{takes into account the}} verbal properties of delusions. An alternative behavioral approach is proposed, which considers delusional beliefs as verbal rules and maintenance of delusions as a form of rule-based insensitivity to changing environmental contingencies. A pilot study is described in which patients formerly presenting with delusional ideas and control participants were exposed in a repeated measures design to three different instructional conditions, instructions, no instructions, and <b>self-instructions,</b> {{in the context of a}} non-signaled changing multiple reinforcement schedule. Results suggest that, in the presence of instructions, patients formerly presenting with delusional ideas demonstrate greater insensitivity to changes in schedule contingencies than control participants.

5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use <b>self-instructions</b> to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to assess the relationship between coping mechanisms and eating disorders as well as to determine coping strategies as predictors of eating disorders pathology. Subjects and methods: Participants included 52 females meeting the DSM-IV criteria for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa and 55 university students. Assessment tools were the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Scale and the Stress Coping Questionnaire. Results: Eating disorders were positively related to substance use, substitute gratification, avoidance, aggression, and drug use. Additionally, significant negative correlations were found between eating disorders and relaxation, planning, using instrumental support, acceptance as well as venting. The regression analysis revealed that eating disorders were positively associated with coping strategies focused on substance use and religion, and negatively associated with using emotional support, positive <b>self-instructions</b> and positive reframing. The non linear principal components analysis allowed for exploring similarities and differences in the latent structure of the configuration of coping strategies between the clinical group and the control group. Conclusions: Since women with anorexia and bulimia nervosa apply emotion-focused coping strategies to manage their stress, psychotherapeutic intervention with these patients should focus on changing inappropriate coping mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Background: Children’s {{reactions}} to painful events vary widely {{but there is}} a fairly wide consensus on the fact that children with leukemia may have special difficulties in dealing with the stressful medical procedures needed for the treatment of their disease. In problem/emotion focused coping three factors categories must be examined: Illness parameters (type, severity, treatment), personal factors (cognitive resources, age and past experiences, gender, temperament) and social factors (protective or risk factors related to family, peers support, environment support). This chapter has two aims: the first is to show and to discuss models on how a child with cancer cope with the illness; the second is to understand how children’s and parents’ factors impact on their coping with the illness and which can be the best strategy adopted by them. Method: Eighty-three leukemic children and their families, recruited at the Haematology-Oncologic Clinic of the Department of Child and Woman Health, University of Padua, participated in this study. Children’s mean age was 6. 69 years (SD = 3. 85, range = 1 year- 17 years), 46 males and 37 females. Mostly children had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) (N = 70), while 13 had Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). All the parents were Caucasian, {{with a mean age of}} 37. 95 years (SD = 5. 93) and a mean of 11. 83 years of schooling (SD= 3. 75). The parents who participated were mostly mothers (N = 73) and only a few were fathers (N = 10) because the mothers were more proximal to the child during hospitalization while fathers stayed with other siblings or continued to work to maintain the family. The families were contacted by a clinical psychologist during the first hospitalization of their children. The project aims were explained and informed consent was asked for. Parental perceptions on child’s coping during hospitalization (EFI-C, Tremolada et al., 2013) and child’s coping with pain (PPCI questionnaire, Varni et al., 1996; Italian version by Bonichini & Axia, 2000) were assessed in the first month after the diagnosis. Results: Problem solving and Cognitive <b>self-instructions</b> were more used with age increasing; Seek for social support was the preferred strategy; Catastrophizing was negatively correlated with child’s coping and adaptability measured at the second week from the diagnosis. Family routine and time reorganization was associated with a major use of Problem solving and Cognitive <b>self-instructions</b> during the first month of therapy. Discussion: These data give relevant information on coping with pain used by children with leukemia at their first hospitalization. Specific interventions can be applied to children taking into consideration their age and their preferred coping strategy. Other supportive interventions can be studied for parents at more risk for their family routine and time reorganization at the diagnosis so to increase the use of cognitive strategies by all the family during the first hospitalization...|$|R

The comparison of automated grades with the instructors grades ms based on correlations between them. In study II, a 2 x 2 between subjects factorial design was used to devise and conduct an experiment. Comparison was made between real time training and above real time training and between feedback and no feedback in training. The performance measure to monitor progress in training was based on deviations in bank angle and altitude. The performance measure was developed after completion of the experiment including the training and test flights. It was not envisaged before the experiment. The experiment did not include <b>self-instructions</b> as it was originally planned, although feedback by experimenter to the trainee was included in the study...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: No {{research}} has yet focused on hypomanic states in non-clinical early adult populations. The {{aim of the}} present study was therefore to assess hypomania in a large non-clinical sample of young adults. METHODS: A total of 862 participants (639 females and 223 males; mean age: M= 24. 67; SD= 5. 91) took part in the study. They completed a series of validated self-report questionnaires assessing hypomania (HCL- 32) and other aspects of psychological functioning, sleep, stress, quality of life, cognitive-emotional elaboration of pain, self-efficacy, and physical activity. RESULTS: Based on the HCL- 32, 19 % of the participants (n= 169) were categorized as currently being in a hypomanic state. Of those, 57. 6 % were classified as "active/elated" ('bright side'), whereas 42. 4 % were classified as "irritable/risk-taking" ('dark side'). Compared to non-hypomanic participants and the 'bright side' group, 'dark side' hypomanic participants reported more depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, somatic complaints, perceived stress, negative coping strategies, and lower self-efficacy. By contrast, 'bright side' hypomanic participants had lower stress scores, more positive <b>self-instructions,</b> and higher levels of exploration, self-efficacy, and physical activity. LIMITATIONS: A cross-sectional design was adopted, assessing university students, who may not be representative of the stage of early adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: The present results underscore the notion of a continuity between a mood state and both favorable ('bright side') and unfavorable ('dark side') hypomanic states. In early adulthood, 'bright' and 'dark side' hypomania differs with respect to physical activity, psychological functioning and sleep...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{clinics are}} {{diagnostic}} laboratories handling plant protection problems {{submitted by the}} extension service or by farmers. In many less-developed countries, plant clinics have a wider function as plant health advisory centres. The Plant Clinic expert system (developed using the KnowledgePro shell) is designed as a training aid for better decision-making and resource use in diagnostic laboratories. It {{can also be used}} to analyse decision making in previous case material. The program stimulates the diagnostic process in a plant clinic, bearing in mind the conditions that occur in many less-developed countries. The package comprises a 3. 5 floppy disc containing the software, together with a user's manual. The program is designed to operate on a personal computer using DOS. The minimum requirements are a 80286 processor and 2 MB of extended memory. Plant Clinic, developed from the extensive experience of the senior author, is designed mainly for students in crop protection courses and for working diagnosticians who desire <b>self-instructions</b> or who are receiving in-service training.
