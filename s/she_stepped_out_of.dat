2500|$|Dennett {{also has}} a {{response}} to the [...] "Mary the color scientist" [...] thought experiment. He argues that Mary would not, in fact, learn something new if <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her black and white room to see the color red. Dennett asserts that if she already truly knew [...] "everything about color", that knowledge would include a deep understanding of why and how human neurology causes us to sense the [...] "quale" [...] of color. Mary would therefore already know exactly what to expect of seeing red, before ever leaving the room. Dennett argues that the misleading aspect of the story is that Mary is supposed to not merely be knowledgeable about color but to actually know all the physical facts about it, which would be a knowledge so deep that it exceeds what can be imagined, and twists our intuitions.|$|E

60|$|In {{those days}} Mary had the loveliest ideas for her sad little book, {{and they came}} to her mostly {{in the morning when}} she was only three-parts awake, but as <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed they all flew away like startled birds. I {{gathered}} from David that this depressed her exceedingly.|$|E

[...] with the very reverse of a smile.|$|E

60|$|As <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the cars}} at Cambridge, Jack opened his honest {{blue eyes and}} indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if there was {{anything}} he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tiny bonnets then in fashion.

5000|$|Rowan Kaiser, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club praised Mac's, Logan's, and Duncan's {{characterization}} in the episode. [...] "This was easily Mac's best episode.

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{their little}} hut, and {{the flames of}} the wood fire leaped up and cast sharp colour upon her face. Of late Philip had only seen her in the trim frocks she had taken to since {{she was at the}} dressmaker's, and there was {{something}} very charming in the print dress she wore now, loose and easy to work in; the sleeves were tucked up and showed her strong, round arms. She too had a sun-bonnet.|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall see," [...] she continued. [...] "Yes, {{you shall}} see. Tell me of disgrace! I have only disgraced myself by being with you. Ah--very well. Yes; I will get out.

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the doorway}} even {{more rapidly than}} she had stepped into it. I might have been mistaken, but I thought Cristel seemed to be {{actually}} alarmed by my proposal. We {{walked up and down}} the river-bank. On every occasion when we approached the cottage, I detected her in stealing a look at the ugly modern part of it. There could be no mistake this time; I saw doubt, I saw anxiety in her face. What was going on at the mill? I made some domestic inquiries, beginning with her father. Was the miller alive and well? ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looks as}} if <b>she</b> had just <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a bandbox of last century, thought Mary.|$|R

50|$|Spells begins {{six months}} after Laurel's close {{encounter}} with death due to Barnes the troll. <b>She</b> <b>steps</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her car, {{ready to go to}} the Academy of Avalon to train as a Fall faerie and is greeted by Tamani. Her supposed summer vacation isn't all that fun because she has to work hard honing her skills as a Fall faerie in order to be prepared to defend herself against situations like the one that happened six months ago. She gets a little time off every now and then, much to her relief, when Tam comes to visit and take her on a tour of Avalon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Steele--wait!" [...] called Miss Sampson as {{he stepped}} out. He uttered a little sound like a hiss or a gasp or an intake of breath, I did not know what; and then the incomprehensible fellow {{bestowed}} a kick upon me that I thought about broke my leg. But I understood and gamely endured the pain. Then {{we were looking at}} Diane Sampson. She was white and wonderful. <b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the door, close to Steele. She did not see me; she cared nothing for my presence. All the world would not have mattered to her then.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{an awfully}} funny house," [...] {{she said to}} herself. [...] "If I could see any stairs, I might go up a little way and call. Surely there must be {{somebody}} alive somewhere." [...] Then the thought suddenly came into her mind that perhaps want {{of life in the}} particular person she had come to see might be the reason of this dreadful stillness and desertion, and without a moment's hesitation <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the back door into the open air. She could not stay in that house another second until she knew. Surely there must be some one on the place who could tell her what had happened.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had made}} a goddess of Nettie, and behold she was a fellow-creature! She came, warm-wrapped and tremulous, to me, with the tender promise of tears in her eyes, with her hands outstretched and that dear smile quivering upon her lips. <b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the dream I had made of her, a thing of needs and regrets and human kindliness. Her hands as I took them were a little cold. The goddess shone through her indeed, glowed in all her body, she was a worshipful temple of love for me--yes. But I could feel, like a thing new discovered, the texture and sinews of her living, her dear {{personal}} and mortal hands. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... "Lawful heart!" [...] puffed Mrs. Stapp, as <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> in <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the biting wind. [...] "I'm right <b>out</b> <b>of</b> breath. Mrs. March, {{allow me}} to {{introduce}} Mrs. Kent. We're looking for Mrs. Baxter. She has run away, and we thought perhaps she came here. Did she?" ...|$|R
60|$|So it {{came about}} that the first words she spoke to him were {{somewhat}} rough in their texture. <b>She</b> <b>stepped</b> forward <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the shadow of the}} Georgian tomb and confronted him with a defiant air, her head thrown back, looking, to tell the truth, rather stately.|$|R
50|$|Act Three returns us to 1919 {{and we see}} how {{the seeds}} of the {{downfall}} of the Conways were being sown even then.
