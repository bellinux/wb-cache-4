40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate issues concerning "inapparent carcinoma" of the gallbladder and the effectiveness of a radical <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> in the treatment of inapparent carcinoma. Ninety-eight patients with inapparent carcinoma were analyzed according to the "pT" category of TNM (tumor, nodes, and metastases) classification. Eighty patients underwent cholecystectomy alone, and 14 patients had a subsequent radical operation. After cholecystectomy alone it was found that (1) Patients with pT 1 cancer had a 5 -year survival rate (5 ysr) of 100 %; (2) In patients with pT 2, 5 ysr was 40 %; and (3) Patients with pT 3 showed 5 ysr of 0 %. Results of a radical <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> showed that (1) Patients with pT 2 cancer showed a 5 ysr of 90 %, significantly better (p less than 0. 05) than pT 2 treated with cholecystectomy alone; (2) There was a prolongation of survival in patients with pT 3 or pT 4. It was concluded that a radical <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> should be carried out for pT 2 or more advanced inapparent carcinoma, whereas follow-up without a <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> is recommended for pT 1 cancer without positive margin...|$|R

According to the literature (Singh, 2010), between 20 - 60 % of patients treated with lumpectomy undergo a <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> (either repeat lumpectomy or mastectomy) because of inadequate margins. The frequency of re-excision varies because of individual institutional definitions of what constitutes an acceptable margin, with most centers preferring 1 - 3 mm {{as opposed to the}} NSABP historical definition of no cancer cells on ink. (Singletary, 2002) Many patients who undergo a <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> have no residual disease.

40|$|Background: To {{examine the}} {{survival}} function and prognostic factors of the adjacent segments {{based on a}} <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> after thoracolumbar spinal fusion. Methods: This retrospective study reviewed 3, 188 patients (3, 193 cases) who underwent a thoracolumbar spinal fusion at the author’s hospital. Survival analysis {{was performed on the}} event of a <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> due to adjacent segment degeneration. The prognostic factors, such as the cause of the disease, surgical procedure, age, gender and number of fusion segments, were examined. Sagittal alignment and the location of the adjacent segment were measured in the <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> cases, and their association with the types of degeneration was investigated. Results: One hundred seven patients, 112 cases (3. 5 %), underwent a <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> due to adjacent segment degeneration. The survival function was 97 % and 94 % at 5 and 10 years after surgery, respectively, showing a 0. 6 % linear reduction per year. The significant prognostic factors were old age, degenerative disease, multiple-level fusion and male. Among the <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> cases, the locations of the adjacent segments were the thoracolumbar junctional area and lumbosacral area in 11. 6 % and 88. 4 % of cases, respectively. Sagittal alignment was negative or neutral, positive and strongly positive in 47. 3 %, 38. 9 %, and 15. 7 %, respectively. Regarding the type of degeneration, spondylolisthesis or kyphosis, retrolisthesis, and neutral balance in the sagittal view was noted in 13. 4 %, 36. 6 %, and 50 % of cases, respectively. There was a significant difference according to the location of the adjacent segment (p = 0. 000) and sagittal alignment (p = 0. 041) ...|$|R

The five layers in the final seam are then called; a) End, b) Body Hook, c) Cover Hook, d) Body, e) Countersink. All sanitary cans require a filling medium within the seam because otherwise the metal-to-metal contact will not maintain a hermetic seal. In most cases, a rubberized compound is placed inside the end curl radius, forming the critical seal between the end and the body.|$|R
40|$|The {{surgical}} indications in 770 {{patients with}} Crohn's disease undergoing intestinal resection at The Mount Sinai Hospital from 1960 - 83 have been reviewed. Surgical indications {{were divided into}} two principal categories: 375 cases with perforating indications and 395 cases non-perforating. Among 292 patients who underwent <b>second</b> <b>operations</b> for recurrent Crohn's disease, the indications for <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> were closely dependent on the indication for primary resection. <b>Second</b> <b>operations</b> were undertaken for perforating indications much more often among cases where the initial indication had been perforating, than among those whose initial indications had been non-perforating (73 % v 29 %, p less than 0. 00001). This trend to similarities in the indications which bring patients to surgery was maintained within each anatomical category of Crohn's disease and even between <b>second</b> and third <b>operations</b> (p less than 0. 001). Operations for perforating indications were followed by reoperation approximately twice as fast as operations for non-perforating indications, whether going from first to <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> (perforating 4. 7 v non-perforating 8. 8 years, p less than 0. 001), or from second to third (perforating 2. 3 v non-perforating 5. 2 years, p less than 0. 005). Crohn's disease thus seems to occur in two different clinical patterns, independent of anatomic distribution. These are a relatively aggressive perforating type and a more indolent non-perforating type, which tend to retain their identities between repeated operations and to influence the speed with which reoperation occurs...|$|R
40|$|Machining is {{the process}} of removal of excess {{material}} from the given work piece to finish it to the required dimensions required as per use. Various metals and alloys are machined with the help of cutting tools like HSS, carbides etc. Majority of the industry manufactured products require machining at some stage ranging from relatively rough or nonprecision work such as cleaning of sprues, risers and gates to high precision work involving tolerances of 0. 0001 inch and high surface finish. Machining <b>operations</b> on <b>lathes</b> involve rotating of work pieces and feeding of cutting tool against it in a specified manner with correct feed. This process involves constant rubbing of tool and work piece which generates a large amount of heat. This heat is usually carried away by the coolant or it is dissipated in the atmosphere. With every passing day, the need for sustainable living on Earth is increasing greatly. For this we need to start extracting and recovering the lost energy. The following paper shows how electricity can be generated from the lost heat produced during machining <b>operation</b> on <b>lathe</b> by using thermocouples. ...|$|R

Although the <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> contained a wide wedge resection, the actual postoperative pulmonary functional parameters measured 1  year after the <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> were almost equal to the predicted ones, given that the volume of wide-wedge resection was similar to that of a single subsegment.|$|R
30|$|A {{decision}} tree outlining the three surgical scenarios was constructed with one decision branch (decision node), 14 chance branches (chance nodes), and 17 outcomes (terminal nodes) (Fig.  1).

In the PPE scenario, implant migration refers to one or several pins migrating under the skin requiring a <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> to remove. Finally, in the PPB scenario, implant migration refers to where buried pins protrude through the skin. If one or more pins were still buried, a <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> for implant removal was still required.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this case}} report is to attract the {{attention}} of related clinicians to similar cases because of their rarity. We believe this case and other similar cases in the literature could initiate studies that may explain the pathways of metastasis. A 50 -year-old female patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of symptomatic cholelithiasis. Postoperative pathologic examination of the specimen led to a diagnosis of signet ring carcinoma in the wall of gallbladder. After this incidental diagnosis, this patient underwent a <b>second</b> <b>operation,</b> which was a radical cholecystectomy. After pathological examination of the <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> material, we decided to call this patient for periodic controls, as the tumor was graded as stage I. A cutaneous lesion 33 months after the <b>second</b> <b>operation</b> was diagnosed as metastasis of signet ring cell carcinoma. Signet ring carcinoma of the gallbladder is a rarely seen malignancy. Cutaneous metastasis of this rare malignancy is also quite rare. There are only a few reports of cutaneous metastasis of signet ring carcinoma of the gallbladder.
