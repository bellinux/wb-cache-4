5|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{probably}} acts as a <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E

25|$|Another type of {{modification}} {{is found}} in male diving beetles (of the family Dytiscidae), who are equipped with <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> structures on their front legs. They use these to grab passing females and attach to their dorsal surfaces. To get the females to submit, males shake the females violently and keep them submerged underwater (diving beetles cannot go long without atmospheric oxygen). Unable to get air, female diving beetles submit to the male’s advances {{in order to avoid}} drowning (and they lose the energy to resist). Once the males attach, copulation can occur.|$|E
30|$|Other {{important}} elements in soft robotics are <b>suction</b> <b>cups.</b> Three types of <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> can be currently {{found in the}} literature: <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> that are actuated by a dielectric elastomer [23], <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> that are actuated by negative [24], and <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> that are actuated by positive air pressure [25].

25|$|Speciation {{has been}} {{observed}} to be a possible consequence of sexual coercion. In diving beetle species family Dytiscidae, an intersexual arms race occurs between males and females. Males have evolved <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> structures on their forelegs to help grasp females; females have counter-evolved setose dorsal furrows to impede forceful copulation. This continuous evolution (in both the forward and reverse directions) {{has led to the}} recent speciation of A. japonicus and A. kishii, where females of A. kishii have lost their dorsal furrows while those of A. japonicus have not.|$|E
25|$|A {{surfboard}} leash or leg rope is {{the cord}} that attaches a surfboard to the surfer. It prevents the surfboard from being {{swept away by}} waves and prevents a runaway surfboard from hitting other surfers and swimmers. Modern leashes comprise a urethane cord where one end has a band with a velcro strap attached to the surfer's trailing foot, and the opposite has a velcro strap attached to {{the tail end of}} the surfboard. The surfboard leash was invented in 1970 by Santa Cruz, California resident Pat O'Neill, son of wetsuit innovator Jack O'Neill, who fastened surgical tubing to the nose of his surfboard with a <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> looped to the end of his wrist in order to leverage turns and cutbacks in the water. However, modifications in 1971 by O'Neill made the surf leash attached to the ankle and to a surfboard's tail, a practice still in use today.|$|E
25|$|Round gobies are small, soft-bodied fish, {{characterized}} by a distinctive black spot on the first dorsal fin. Their eyes are large and protrude slightly {{from the top of}} the head and, like most gobies, round gobies have pelvic fins that are fused to form a single disc on the belly of the fish shaped like a <b>suction</b> <b>cup.</b> Round gobies range in length from 4 to 10nbsp&inches (maximum of 9.7nbsp&inches (24.6nbsp&cm)), and in weight from 0.176 ounces to 2.816 ounces, increasing as they age. Male round gobies are larger than females. Juvenile round gobies (less than one year old) are grey. Upon maturation, round gobies become mottled with gray, black, brown, and olive green markings. Adult male round gobies turn inky black during the spawning season and develop swollen cheeks. Male and female round gobies are easily differentiated through the shape of their urogenital papilla, which is white to grey, long and pointed in males, and brown, short and blunt-tipped in females.|$|E

40|$|Both the {{bioavailability}} of a trace metal (TM) in a {{soil and}} the risk of leaching to the ground water are linked to the metals concentra-tion in the soil solution. Sampling soil solution by tension lysimetry with <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> is a simple and established technique that is increas-ingly used for monitoring dissolved TM in soils. Of major concern, however, is the sorption of TM by the walls of the samplers. Metal sorption by different materials used in <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> can vary widely, depending also on the chemistry of the soil solution. We compared the sorption of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb by different standard-size and micro <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> in the laboratory at two pH values (4. 5 and 7. 5 or 8. 0) in absence and presence of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In addition, we investigated the sorption of DOC from different origins by the cup materials.

25|$|Lepeophtheirus salmonis {{tends to}} be {{approximately}} {{twice the size of}} most Caligus spp. (e.g. C. elongatus, C. clemensi, etc.). The body consists of 4 regions: cephalothorax, fourth leg-bearing segment, genital complex, and abdomen. The cephalothorax forms a broad shield that includes all of the body segments up to the third leg-bearing segment. It acts like a <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> in holding the louse on the fish. All species have mouth parts shaped as a siphon or oral cone (characteristic of the Siphonostomatoida). The second antennae and oral appendages are modified to assist in holding the parasite on the fish. The second pair of antennae is also used by males to grasp the female during copulation. The adult females are always significantly larger than males and develop a very large genital complex which in many species makes up the majority of the body mass. Two egg strings of 500 to 1000 eggs (L. salmonis), which darken with maturation, are approximately the same length as the female’s body. One female can produce 6-11 pairs of egg strings in a lifetime of approximately 7 months.|$|E
500|$|During early {{discussions with}} Obsidian, Parker and Stone were adamant {{that the game}} should {{faithfully}} replicate the show's unique 2D-style visuals, {{which are based on}} cutout animation. Obsidian provided proofs of concept that they could achieve the South Park look; Stone and Parker were satisfied with this. Skyrim was the game's initial influence and further inspiration came from the 1994 role-playing game EarthBound. Parker and Stone said that the blended 2D/3D visuals of Paper Mario and the silent protagonist Link from The Legend of Zelda series also provided inspiration for the design. The characters' costumes and classes are taken from the 2002 South Park episode [...] "The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers". Obsidian created various fantasy-styled items, armor, and weapons but Parker and Stone told them to [...] "make it crappier" [...] to create the impression that the children had found or made the objects themselves; weapons consisted of golf clubs, hammers, <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> arrows and wooden swords, while bathrobes, oven mitt gloves, and towels worn as capes served as clothing. South Park studios provided Obsidian with access to the show's full archive of art assets, allowing Obsidian to include previously unused ideas, such as discarded Chinpokomon designs. Actors from the show provided voice work, and Obsidian was given access to South Parks audio resources, including sound effects, music, and the show's composer Jamie Dunlap.|$|E
500|$|Storylines for a {{potential}} series had been drafted by writer Mike Bullen during production of the pilot. When production on the series began, producer Christine Langan worked with him to create detailed plots for all six episodes, also acting as a script editor to redraft Bullen's work. Many of the plots were drawn from his own life; Pete and Jenny bringing up their new baby paralleled Bullen and his wife, whose first child was born in late 1997. The scenes where Pete and Jenny attend the antenatal classes were written from Bullen's memory, {{when he and his}} wife were [...] "given callipers, forceps and a <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> to play with". The conclusion of the fourth episode, in which Pete's father dies on the way to his grandson's christening, was suggested by Harries, whose own experience of the death of his father taught him that people rarely have the opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones in real life. Not all storylines were based on real life: For Karen and David's marriage guidance scenes in Episode 5, Bullen consulted the relationship support charity Relate. Actors and directors also had input into the scripts; Bullen's original script for the marriage therapy scenes ended with David shouting and apparently using a fire extinguisher as an offensive weapon. Bathurst was not convinced that was something that his character would do, as David is [...] "too much of a coward to do anything overtly" [...] and would not leave himself so [...] "exposed": ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Darwin {{illustrated}} {{his sexual}} selection theory with {{male and female}} morphology of diving beetles, but maintained a cooperative view of their interaction. Present theory suggests that instead sexual conflict should be a widespread evolutionary force driving both intersexual coevolutionary arms races and speciation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We combined Bayesian phylogenetics, complete taxon sampling and a multi-gene approach to test the arms race scenario on a robust diving beetle phylogeny. As predicted, <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> in males and modified dorsal surfaces in females showed a pronounced coevolutionary pattern. The female dorsal modifications impair the attachment ability of male <b>suction</b> <b>cups,</b> but each antagonistic novelty in females corresponds to counter-differentiation of <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> in males. CONCLUSIONS: A recently diverged sibling species pair in Japan is possibly one consequence of this arms race and we suggest that future studies on hypoxia might reveal {{the key to the}} extraordinary selection for female counter-adaptations in diving beetles...|$|R
