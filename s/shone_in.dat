Among his influences at Oxford were WS Watt, R Meiggs, RM Hare, Elizabeth Anscombe, Eric Dodds, Eduard Fraenkel, David Pears and Gilbert Ryle. He <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> {{the first part of}} the course, the pure classics (being particularly fond of writing Latin verses in the style of Ovid) and graduated in 1951 with a congratulatory first in the second part of the course and a prize fellowship at All Souls.|$|E
5|$|The ancient oracles of the prophets, {{delivered}} {{to us in}} the Scripture, declare this; the lives of pious men, who <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> old time with every virtue, bear witness to posterity of the same; and our own days prove it to be true, wherein Constantine, who alone of all that ever wielded the Roman power was the friend of God the Sovereign of all, has appeared to all mankind so clear an example of a godly life.|$|E

25|$|A {{comfortable}} {{victory for}} West Indies won them the Prudential Trophy for a faster scoring rate {{over the two}} games. Only Keith Fletcher, with 63, <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> England's innings as Lance Gibbs bowled his 11 overs for just 12 runs and Clive Lloyd, drafted in to bowl because Sobers was unfit, took two for 25. Man of the Match Roy Fredericks made 105 and put on 143 with Alvin Kallicharran (53 not out) to take his side to within four of victory.|$|E
25|$|Bennett {{was also}} a noted talent spotter. He took note of and {{encouraged}} the young Lester Pearson in the early 1930s, and appointed Pearson to significant roles on two major government inquiries: the 1931 Royal Commission on Grain Futures, and the 1934 Royal Commission on Price Spreads. Bennett saw that Pearson was recognized with an OBE after he <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> that work, arranged a bonus of $1,800, and invited him to a London conference. Former Prime Minister John Turner, who as a child, knew Bennett while he was prime minister, praised Bennett's promotion of Turner's economist mother to the highest civil service post held by a Canadian woman to that time.|$|E
25|$|With the West Indies touring England in 2004, it was {{expected}} that Harmison, who had also <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> the three-match Test series against New Zealand earlier in 2004, would again be England's lead bowler, and the West Indies captain Brian Lara went as far as suggesting that England had no plan B after Harmison. However, Harmison was outshone by spin bowler Ashley Giles for the first three Tests, before he took 9 wickets in the final Test match. In that final match, he also punished the West Indies bowling with the bat, hitting three sixes and three fours in a brief innings ending at 34 not out. Harmison's bowling performance in this match took him {{to the top of the}} Pricewaterhousecoopers cricket ratings. In 2004, Harmison took 67 wickets in just 13 matches, at a superb average of 23.92.|$|E

25|$|In 1927, after {{scoring the}} top {{marks on the}} Canadian foreign service entry exam, he then {{embarked}} on {{a career in the}} Department of External Affairs. Prime Minister R. B.

Pearson was assigned to the High Commission of Canada to the United Kingdom in 1935, and he served there during World War II from 1939 through 1942 as the second-in-command at Canada House, where he coordinated military supply and refugee problems, serving under High Commissioner Vincent Massey.|$|E
25|$|Real Madrid {{subsequently}} accepted first an £11million bid from Middlesbrough {{and then}} a £12million bid for McManaman from Chelsea that included the exchange of Tore André Flo, {{in the summer of}} 2000, both of which the player rejected. A Sky Sports report in August 2000 also stated that eight other clubs were racing for his signature at the time, including Manchester United, Parma and Fiorentina, but McManaman remained adamant even as Sir Alex Ferguson also declared his admiration for McManaman by arranging a contingent to convince him to sign but McManaman said he wanted to succeed in Spain. His stance was rewarded when Real relented after a Spanish poll in El Mundo showed 90% of the fans demanded the club keep McManaman, while Míchel Salgado complained to the management about the way McManaman was treated after McManaman turned down yet again, another transfer attempt, this time to Lazio, who came in with an £8million offer. Real's change toward McManaman began when Del Bosque gave him his first appearance of the 2000–01 season as a substitute in a 3–3 draw against Málaga in September. McManaman reportedly won over the manager by October, and managed to feature in two thirds of the club's matches, becoming a first team regular for {{the second half of the}} campaign, and held the unique distinction of being described as the only top class football player from England playing overseas at the time. McManaman <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> this second season at Madrid as his club side challenged for the La Liga title and Champions League; they lost in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich, but won their 28th La Liga crown by a seven-point margin over the previous season's champions, Deportivo de La Coruña.|$|E
500|$|Rugby, {{like other}} English public schools, had evolved its own variant of football. The game in Wills' era—a rough and highly {{defensive}} struggle involving hundreds of boys—was {{confined to a}} competition amongst the houses. Spanning his school years, Wills {{is one of the}} few players who is named in the newspapers' brief match reports. His creative play and [...] "eel-like agility" [...] baffled the opposition, and his penchant for theatrics endeared him to the crowds. One journalist noted his use of [...] "slimy tricks", a possible early reference to his gamesmanship. As a [...] "dodger" [...] in the forward line, he was a long and accurate shot at goal and served as his house's kicker. Wills also <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> the school's annual athletics carnival and his long-distance running ability in Hare and Hounds was unparalleled.|$|E

500|$|After {{reviewing}} the hype surrounding the book, author Barbara Schaaf concluded that its prose [...] "was first-rate – literate and with flashes of timeless insight. Anyone {{who can take}} a 15-year-old heroine... and dash off over 700 pages just {{to get her to}} age 21 without losing the reader, has real talent." [...] Schaaf added that Koen has a [...] "fine eye for art, architecture, fashion, manners and relays the everything," [...] though she critiqued the author for sometimes inserting too many historical details. She believed that the book especially <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> depicting the South Sea Bubble; [...] "most historical writers," [...] Schaaf opined, [...] "neglect the economic background of their periods, regardless of its importance, and [...] grasp of a complicated situation makes it as fascinating as her descriptions of the sexual behavior of the upper and lower classes." ...|$|E
500|$|The Twenty20 Cup gave White {{another chance}} to display his skills in the {{shortest}} format of the game. [...] White was joined at Somerset by fellow Australian Justin Langer for the tournament, and the pair <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> Somerset's opening match of the competition. [...] Opening the innings, Langer made 90 runs off 46balls, but was outscored and outpaced by White's 116*, scored at more than two runs a ball. [...] The century was White's first in Twenty20 cricket, and he capped off his performance by claiming Gloucestershire's tenth wicket to wrap up a 117run victory. Just under two weeks later, White surpassed this score, {{at the time the}} joint highest made in Twenty20 cricket, with 141* against Worcestershire. His runs, made off 70 balls, set a new world record Twenty20 total that would stand for almost two years before being beaten by Brendon McCullum. He finished the competition with the leading batting average, and his 403runs trailed only teammate Langer's 464 and Leicestershire batsman Hylton Ackerman's 409.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{as a whole}} has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from critics. AOL TV's Brad Trechak wrote that it [...] "showed a level of imagination that the recent Halloween episodes have been lacking" [...] and that it [...] "started good and got progressively better [...] ". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, on the other hand, commented that the segments [...] "got weaker as they went along". He added the episode [...] "wasn't awful, and it did have some solid laughs, but the quality of the segments was decidedly hit and miss." [...] These two critics both praised Bart's dream for being funny and Lisa's dream for its Inglourious Basterds parody. They had different opinions on the last two sequences, though. Trechak thought Stewart [...] "really <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> , playing some sort of parody of herself crossed with Mary Poppins and Satan," [...] and singled out the live-action sequence as his favorite because he is a fan of Jim Henson, the creator of The Muppets. VanDerWerff commented that [...] "Marge's visit from Martha Stewart was one joke stretched too far, and the final segment with the Muppet Simpsons was far too stilted." ...|$|E

500|$|After his {{impressive}} {{form for}} Australia A during January 2005, White {{was selected as}} part of the Australia A side to tour Pakistan in September that year. [...] After claiming four wickets, and averaging 35.50 with the bat in the 2 four-day matches, White <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> the subsequent one-day games. [...] Not required to bat in the first, he then scored 106 not out in the second and 59 not out in the third, also claiming a tail-end wicket. Having now demonstrated his ability as a big-hitting all-rounder, White was selected to make his international debut during the 2005 ICC Super Series against the ICC World XI. [...] Shaun Pollock, captaining the World XI team, said that his batsmen would target the young leg-spinner, but Australia captain Ricky Ponting said he expected White to bowl, after he'd [...] "handled things well in the Victoria game against them". He was named as supersub in the first two matches, being on field only during the ICC World XI innings, therefore being unable to bat. [...] He did not bowl in the first match, and only bowled three wicket-less overs in the second. [...] Despite controversy regarding the official status of the matches, these two appearances as supersub signified White's first two One Day International (ODI) appearances. [...] He started the third match, but as Australia closed their innings on 293/5, White was again not required to bat, nor did he bowl in the following ICC World XI innings.|$|E
500|$|David Denby {{described}} Smith's {{performance as}} contrasting with his performances {{in his other}} films. He said, [...] "For {{the first time in}} his life, Will Smith doesn’t flirt with the audience... he stays in character as a self-hating lonely guy." [...] Stephen Hunter argued that Smith and his co-stars had misunderstood the material in the same manner as Berg. He added that the examination of Smith's character came across at first as an examination of [...] "phenomenally gifted" [...] black sporting superstars who were [...] "marginalized", [...] "dehumanized" [...] and exploited as a product by society. Manohla Dargis was struck by Theron's performance, saying that she enabled Smith to deepen the film's emotional complexity. Todd McCarthy said that Smith's [...] "attitude-laden quips" [...] helped to carry the film's superior first half, and that all three leads performed capably, but he said no opportunity was offered for the supporting characters to register. Roger Ebert writing in the Chicago Sun Times praised the three leads, saying that Smith avoided playing Hancock [...] "as a goofball" [...] and instead portrayed him as a more subtle and serious character. Stephen Farber said that Hancock was a good showcase for the leads, affirming that Smith <b>shone</b> <b>in</b> a film that was only sporadically worthy of his performance, while Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent said that despite the mix of themes [...] "the laughs are frequent and genuine (no forced slapstick), the fight scenes exciting and the emotional stuff quite moving [...] ".|$|E
