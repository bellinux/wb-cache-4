The club receives from the school a budget which allows the hiring of professional directors, music directors, and choreographers but the shows are student produced, with all elements of technical design run by the club's executive board.|$|E

5|$|A dyarchy {{was created}} in Madras Presidency in 1920 as per the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms with {{provisions}} made for elections in the presidency. Democratically elected governments would henceforth share power with the Governor's autocratic establishment. Following the first elections held in November 1920, the Justice Party, an organisation established in 1916 to campaign for increased representation of non-Brahmins in the administration, came to power. A. Subbarayalu Reddiar became the first Chief Minister of the Madras Presidency but resigned soon after due to declining health {{and was replaced by}} P. Ramarayaningar, Minister of Local Self-Government and Public Health, popularly known as the Raja of Panagal. The party split in late 1923 when C. R. Reddy resigned from primary membership and formed a <b>splinter</b> <b>group</b> allied with the opposition Swarajists. A motion of no-confidence was proposed against Ramarayaningar's government on 27 November 1923, but was defeated 65–44. Ramarayaningar remained in power until November 1926. The enactment in August 1921 of the first communal Government Order (G.O. No. 613), which introduced caste-based communal reservations in government jobs, remains one of the high points of his rule. In the following elections of 1926 the Justice Party lost. However, as no party was able to obtain a clear majority, the Governor, Lord Goschen, set up a cross-party government under the leadership of P. Subbarayan and nominated its supporting members. In the election of 1930, the Justice Party was victorious, and P. Munuswamy Naidu became Chief Minister. The exclusion of Zamindars from the Ministry split the Justice Party once again. Fearing a no-confidence motion against him, Munuswamy Naidu resigned in November 1932 and the Raja of Bobbili was appointed Chief Minister in his place. The Justice Party eventually lost the 1937 elections to the Indian National Congress, and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari became Chief Minister of Madras Presidency.|$|E

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{existence}} of the <b>splinter</b> <b>groups</b> in any society, the disintegration myth arises inevitably. This is not due to the historic necessity referred to the movement, but because it is believed that social cohesiveness will always be broken by the religious subversion. Therefore, the way to handle any subversion is normally power approach, starting from decree of deviation, stigmatization which causes social unrest in the society, and even religion disgracing. The effect is violence to the <b>splinter</b> <b>groups</b> movement in the name of religion. For this time being, dialogue (although does not touch the essential part of the problem) is always focused on the status of the religions. While the relationship among religions is protected under the constitution and nationalism imagination, the dialogue intra religion is avoided which makes any <b>splinter</b> <b>groups</b> movement result in mass violence either cognitively, verbally, or physically. </p...|$|R
