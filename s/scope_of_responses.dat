Up to date, more than 22, 000 students from 29 different health divisions have been trained. This strategy was designed to provide more flexibility and diversity to the training programs of the Health System within the framework of a deep and complex organizational change promoted by Health Reform. The main results show that the integration of organizational, teaching, logistic and budgetary aspects {{has turned out to be}} a key element in its success, validating the relevance of the provided solutions. The access to training by means of e-learning or blended learning (electronic education that includes traditional and distance learning activities) allowed employees to choose more independently what, where and when to study. This fact accounts for the high demand for this program. Through this initiative, the National Health System, introduced a wider <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> to training needs, which will mean a better adaptation to the challenges associated to health care...|$|E

PTH was found to regulate the activity of only the apical Na Pi cotransporter, having {{no effect on the}} basolateral transport systems. Transport inhibition was approximately 100 -fold more sensitive to apical PTH application (Kd: 5 x 10 (- 12) M) than to basolateral application (Kd: 5 x 10 (- 10) M). The time-course <b>of</b> the inhibitory <b>response</b> was identical from the two cell surfaces, with half-maximum inhibition occurring at about 20 min and almost full inhibition by 90 min. Experiments on diffusion and degradation demonstrated that the difference in Kd at the two cell surfaces was not due to differential metabolism or diffusion. Tests of cooperativity between the apical and basolateral regulatory events at intermediate concentrations suggested that the presence of PTH {{on one side of the}} monolayer reduced the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> from the other side. At maximum doses of PTH (10 (- 7) - 10 (- 8) M) the transport inhibition from either side was equal and not additive.

We aimed to identify barriers or facilitators to people from minority ethnic groups accessing prehospital care {{and to explore}} the causes and consequences of any differences in delivery. Methodology We conducted a systematic literature review and narrative synthesis. Electronic searches from 2003 through to 2013 identified studies; systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental, case and observational studies. A researcher extracted data to determine characteristics, results and quality, each checked by a second reviewer. Outcome measures were delays in patient calls, mortality rates and survival to 30 days post-discharge. Results Sixteen studies met criteria for the review, two from the UK and 14 from the United States. Barriers to accessing care included difficulties in communication where English was the patient’s second language, new migrants’ {{lack of knowledge of}} the healthcare system leading to inappropriate calls and cultural assumptions among clinical staff resulting in inappropriate treatment. There were limited facilitators to access including translation services and staff education, but the latter were poorly described or developed. Where outcomes were discussed, there was evidence for ethnicity-related disparity in mortality and survival rates. This could reflect differences in condition severity, delays between onset and initiation of calls, or the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> and assistance.

40|$|Demand {{response}} and distributed generation are {{key components of}} power systems. Several challenges are raised at both technical and business model levels for integration of those resources in smart grids and microgrids. The implementation of a distribution network as a test bed can be difficult and not cost-effective; using computational modeling is not sufficient for producing realistic results. Real-time simulation allows us to validate the business model’s impact at the technical level. This paper comprises a platform supporting the real-time simulation of a microgrid connected to a larger distribution network. The implemented platform allows us to use both centralized and distributed energy resource management. Using an optimization model for the energy resource operation, a virtual power player manages all the available resources. Then, the simulation platform allows us to technically validate the actual implementation of the requested demand reduction in the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> demand <b>response</b> programs.

40|$|Introduction Research {{addressing}} inequalities {{has focused}} predominantly on primary and community care; few initiatives {{relate to the}} prehospital environment. We aimed to identify in the literature barriers or facilitators experienced by patients from black and minority ethnic (BME) communities in accessing prehospital care and to explore the causes and consequences of any differences in delivery. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review and narrative synthesis. Electronic and journal hand searches from 2003 through 2013 identified relevant evaluative studies (systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental, case and observational studies). A researcher extracted data to determine characteristics, results and quality, each checked by a second reviewer. The main outcome measures were delays in patient calls, mortality rates and 30 -days survival post discharge. Results Eighteen studies met criteria for the review: two concerned services in England and Wales and 15 were United States based. Reported barriers to accessing care were generic (and well-known) given the heterogeneity of BME groups: difficulties in communication where English was the patient’s second language; new migrants’ {{lack of knowledge of}} the health care system leading to inappropriate emergency calls; and cultural assumptions among clinical staff resulting in inappropriate diagnoses and treatment. There were limited reported facilitators to improvement, such as the need for translation services and staff education, but the latter were poorly described or developed. Where outcomes were discussed, there was evidence for race-related disparity in mortality and survival rates. This could reflect differences in condition severity, delays between onset and initiation of calls, or the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> and assistance. Conclusion The paucity of literature and difficulties of transferring findings from US to UK context identified an important research gap. Further studies should be undertaken to investigate UK differences in prehospital care and outcomes for BME groups, followed by qualitative approaches to understand barriers and enablers to equitable access...|$|R
40|$|D. E. Berlyne's {{principle}} that uncertainty leads to exploration is extended to situations involving frustrativc nonreward. Both empirical evidence and logical analysis support the frustration-exploration hypothesis, which posits that uncertain frustration leads to exploration, whose primary {{function is to}} broaden the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> selection. The facilitative effects of frustration-motivated exploration in learning are documented, and their implications for education are discussed. One of Daniel Berlyne's abiding interests was in curiosity and exploration. Perhaps, among his many significant contributions to psychology, his {{work in this area}} has made the greatest impact. His 1960 monograph Conflict, Arousal and Curiosity is among the 100 books most cited by social scientists (Garfield, 1978). Few will disagree that it is mainly due to Berlyne's influ-ence that exploration or information seeking has been elevated to the same status as hedonism as one of the primary sources of motivation. In view of the prevalence of information seeking (Berlyne, 1966), a case may be made that it is a more important motivation than the pursuit of hedonic goals. In paying tributes to Berlyne, I cannot help but reminisce on the good old days of being a grad-uate student at the University of Toronto, when both Daniel Berlyne and Abram Amsel were on the psychology faculty. To be taught by these two eminent psychologists was to be influenced by them in a profound way. Although different in many ways in their approaches to research, both of them demonstrated a remarkable degree of independence of thought in the midst of shift-ing paradigms and changing fashions in psycho-logical research.

40|$|The {{explanation}} of obesity {{as a simple}} result of positive energy balance fails {{to account for the}} <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>responses</b> to diets and lifestyles. It is postulated that individual physiological and anatomical variation may be responsible for developing obesity. Girls in poor families develop greater adiposity than their male siblings, a trend not present in richer environments. This indicates strong influence of estrogen on fat accumulation irrespective of poor socioeconomic conditions. Obesity rates in males and females of developed nations are similar, while in poorer nations obesity is much more prevalent in females. Female to male ratio of obesity correlates inversely with gross domestic product. Therefore, the parity of male and female obesity in developed countries may result from male exposure to environmental estrogen-like substances associated with affluence. These hormonally driven mechanisms may be equally active within both sexes in more developed areas, thereby increasing overall obesity. James P. Grantham, Maciej Henneber...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a question {{motivated by the}} third law of thermodynamics: can there be a local temperature arbitrarily close to absolute zero in a nonequilibrium quantum system? We consider nanoscale quantum conductors with the source reservoir held at finite temperature and the drain held at or near absolute zero, a problem outside the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> linear <b>response</b> theory. We obtain local temperatures close to absolute zero when electrons originating from the finite temperature reservoir undergo destructive quantum interference. The local temperature is computed by numerically solving a nonlinear system of equations describing equilibration of a scanning thermoelectric probe with the system, and we obtain excellent agreement with analytic results derived using the Sommerfeld expansion. A local entropy for a nonequilibrium quantum system is introduced, and used as a metric quantifying the departure from local equilibrium. It is shown that the local entropy of the system tends to zero when the probe temperature tends to zero, consistent with the third law of thermodynamics. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R

40|$|The {{parasitic}} angiosperm Orobanche aegyptiaca (Pers.) (Egyptian broomrape) is a root holoparasite {{that causes}} severe losses in yield {{and quality of}} many crops. Control of Orobanche is extremely challenging, {{in part because the}} parasite is hidden underground for most of its life cycle. However, the dependence of the parasite on the host suggests that broomrape-resistant hosts could be an ideal control method. Genetic engineering strategies may facilitate realization of this goal, but require an understanding <b>of</b> host defense <b>responses</b> to parasitism. Previous studies with tobacco indicated that broomrape parasitism induces host genes associated with jasmonic acid (JA) -mediated defenses such as wound responses and localized production of phenylpropanoid and isoprenoid phytoalexins. However, the gene for the pathogenesis-related (PR) protein, PR- 1 a, was not induced by parasitism in tobacco. Expression of PR- 1 a is correlated with the salicylic acid (SA) -mediated defense pathway that leads to systemic acquired resistance (SAR).

Currently, whether working inde-pendently, in collaborative practice with physicians, or as members of geriatric teams, geriatric nurse practition-ers and clinical specialists have been shown to improve care to older adults in the community, in hospitals, and in skilled nursing facilities. Sixty-three master’s programs now prepare advanced practice geriatric nurses. Geri-atric nurse researchers have contributed to our understanding of the most pressing problems that impact pro-foundly on the health and quality of life of older adults.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis has posed profound threats to pension welfare worldwide. This is particularly {{so in the}} United Kingdom with the closure of private defined benefit plans, and the heavy losses experienced by many defined contribution pension plan participants. Meeting these challenges has placed a premium on plan governance, given its link to fund performance. This paper begins by considering the academic literature on institutional change, including {{an analysis of the}} most common ways of responding to a changing environment. It is noted that the nature and <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> institutional <b>response</b> to a changing environment depends, in part, upon funds’ governance budgets, including time, expertise and common commitment. Our research on UK governance suggests that incremental adaptation has been the operative strategy augmented, in some cases, by the adoption of UK corporate governance practices. Three types of innovation in the governance of UK pension plans are identified: the transformation of decision-making, the pension buy-out and fiduciary management alongwith an emerging ‘new’ model of pension fund governance. In the penultimate section of this paper, lessons from UK best practice are drawn for institutions that face unprecedented challenges in realising the pension promise. Thereafter, we suggest a possible approach for regulators to strengthen the pension fund sector, based on improved disclosure, independent board chairs and the skills of board members...|$|R

To increase the scalability and usability of the CUE, we set out to create {{a new version of the}} assessment that preserves the insights afforded by a free-response format while exploiting the logistical advantages of a multiple-choice assessment. We used our extensive database <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> to the free-response CUE to construct distractors for a new version where students can select multiple responses and receive partial credit based on the accuracy and consistency of their selections. Here, we describe the development of this modified CUE format, which we call coupled multiple-response (CMR), and present data from direct comparisons of both versions. We find that the two formats have the same average score and perform similarly on multiple measures of validity and reliability, suggesting that the new version is a potentially viable alternative to the original CUE for the purpose of large-scale research-based assessment.

To limit the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> this contribution we address two controversial issues with different impact and responses: mandatory information on country of origin/place of provenance (COO/ PP) and voluntary information governed by the Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation (NHCR).

In recent years this ‘classical Dunantist paradigm’ has been paralleled and partly overtaken by a radically different paradigm, which can be called the ‘resilience paradigm’. Whereas the classical paradigm centres on principled aid, the resilience paradigm foregrounds building on local response capabilities. Both paradigms have a strong logic that dictates a specific way of seeing the nature of crisis, the humanitarian system, the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the humanitarian <b>response,</b> the identity <b>of</b> humanitarian actors {{and the nature of}} institutions and people in crisis-affected areas.

30|$|According to {{importance}} <b>of</b> demand <b>response</b> {{programs in}} smart grids and microgrids, many {{efforts have been}} made to change the consumption patterns of the users, and the use of renewable resources has also increased. Significant part of energy consumption belongs to buildings such as residential, commercial, and office buildings. Many buildings are equipping with components {{that can be used for}} the participation in demand response programs. The SCADA system plays a key role in this context, which enables the building operator to have control and monitor the consumption and generation. This paper presents a real implementation of an optimization based SCADA system, which employs several controlling and monitoring methods in order to manage the consumption and generation of the building for decision support and participating in demand response events. Since the air conditioning devices are suitable controllable appliances for direct load control demand response, and lighting system as flexible loads for reduction and curtailment, they can play a key role in the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> demand <b>response</b> programs. In this system, several real controller components manage the consumption of lighting system and air conditioning of the building based on an optimization model. In the case study of the paper, the SCADA system is considered as a player of an aggregation model, which is considered as demand response managing entity, and its performance during demand response events will be surveyed. The obtained results show that with adequate small reduction in the lighting system and air conditioning devices, the electricity customers are able to actively participate in the electricity markets using demand response programs and also for internal efficient use of electricity.|$|R
