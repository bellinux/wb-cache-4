40|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} multicore processors in {{all kind of}} computing devices is <b>springing</b> <b>interest</b> for parallel computing, {{which is the only}} approach to achieve the promised performance boosts. Parallel computing is not easy, and the resulting complexity, which is usually tolerated in the computational science field, must be strictly controlled in commercial software life cycles. OpenMP is a widely supported industrial standard for parallel computing on multiprocessors systems. Its basic principles, simplicity and incremental approach, make it an extremely productive paradigm. Up to version 2. 5, OpenMP didn’t directly support parallelization of algorithms in which more work is generated dynamically and with irregular patterns as data are processed. These algorithms are of growing relevance in the scientific realm, and are widespread in most commercial software. OpenMP 3. 0 introduced a new tasking model, that allows work to be dynamically generated and assigned to idle processors. CASPUR was a very active contributor to the new model development...|$|E

This article sets out those issues and seeks a solution to them. Key points.

25|$|The two agents {{attempt to}} get {{information}} on Masters by putting one of his criminal associates, attorney Max Waxman, under surveillance. Vukovich falls asleep on watch, and consequently they fail to catch Masters {{in the act of}} murdering Waxman. While Vukovich wants to go by the book, Chance becomes increasingly reckless and unethical in his efforts to catch Masters. While Chance relies on his sexual-extortion relationship with parolee/informant Ruth for information, Vukovich meets privately with Masters' attorney, Bob Grimes. Grimes, acknowledging a potential conflict of interest that could ruin his legal practice, agrees to set up a meeting between his client and the two agents, who engage Masters by posing as bankers from Palm <b>Springs</b> <b>interested</b> in Masters' counterfeiting services. Masters is reluctant to work with them, but ultimately agrees to print them $1,000,000 worth of fake bills.|$|R

Individual self-control improves with age as a result of many factors: changing biology through hormonal development, socialization and increasing opportunity costs of losing control. In addition, criminal acts are often markedly non-controlled; they are both opportunistic and short-sighted.|$|R

40|$|Resource {{demand and}} {{environmental}} degradation have reached unsustainable levels. A sustainable future requires industrial systems’ attention and improvement. Industrial ecology <b>springs</b> from <b>interests</b> {{to integrate the}} notions of sustainability into environmental and economic systems (Allenby 1992). The {{fact is that the}} economy operates as an open system, drawing raw materials from the environment and returning vast amounts of unused by-products in the form of pollution and waste. The products that firms market are {{only a small portion of}} what their processes turn out; a significant portion of their output eventually leaves the economy as waste and returns to the environment in forms that may stress it unacceptably. (Ehrenfeld & Gertler, 1997). Increased economic output will still cause increased environmental harm.

5000|$|Deeds {{of trust}} differ from {{mortgages}} in that deeds of trust always involve {{at least three}} parties, where the third party holds the legal title, while {{in the context of}} mortgages, the mortgagor gives legal title directly to the mortgagee. [...] In either case, equitable title remains with the borrower. Both mortgages and deeds of trust are essentially security instruments in the form of conveyances; that is, they appear to provide on their face for absolute conveyances of legal title, but it is implicitly understood that the borrower is retaining equitable title and the conveyance is intended to merely create a security interest. This confusing situation is a legacy of the archaic (and now-obsolete) common law requirement of livery of seisin, under which English common law courts had refused to enforce shifting fees or <b>springing</b> freehold <b>interests</b> (that is, a gage for years that was supposed to automatically expand to fee simple title if the underlying debt was not repaid).|$|R

50|$|In 1899, John Brisben Walker (editor of Cosmo, {{and early}} {{investor}} {{in the area}} around Colorado <b>Springs)</b> expressed <b>interest</b> in purchasing the Stanley’s car business. The brothers were reluctant and decided to ask for a good deal more than they thought he would accept - $250,000. To their surprise, Walker accepted their offer immediately although he had to seek the financial backing of “Asphalt King” Amzi L. Barber to close the deal. For a few months, Walker and Barber managed the enterprise together. During this period, although they no longer owned the company, the Stanley Brothers stayed on as consultants; Francis in manufacturing and Freelan in marketing. This period marked a number of publicity stunts for which Stanley automobiles received much notoriety. In August 1899, Freelan and Flora Stanley became the first of many motorists to reach the top of Mt. Washington, the tallest peak in New England. In November of the same year, Freelan gave William McKinley a tour of Washington DC in a Stanley automobile marking the first time a sitting U.S. President had ridden in a car.|$|R

This <b>interest</b> <b>springs</b> from Dr. Shibata's unique observation that cold-storage modifies the responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle to certain drugs (1). Dr. Shibata's subsequent research has provided evidence for differential effects of cold storage on the autonomic nervous system in isolated perfused tissue (2, 3). At a recent FASEB meeting in Atlantic City, this laboratory presented evidence supporting the theory that with prolonged cold storage there is a depletion of tissue stores of catecholamines.

This <b>interest</b> <b>sprang</b> mainly from self-conscious nationalism which makes it curious at least that a foreigner chose a text about Britain. Vergil did, however, have a motive; this project provided a background for his anti-Arthurian position.

40|$|Science {{reporting}} {{in the media}} often involves contested issues, such as, e. g., biotechnology, climate change, and more recently, geoengineering. The reporter’s framing of the issue is likely to influence readers’ perception of it. The notion of framing is related to how individuals and groups perceive and communicate about the world. Framing is typically studied by means of content analysis, focusing primarily on the ‘stories’ told about the issue. The current paper, on the other hand, <b>springs</b> from an <b>interest</b> in writer behavior. I wish to investigate how news writers strategically exploit their rhetorical competence when reporting on contested issues, and I argue that text linguistics represents a fruitful approach to studying this process.
