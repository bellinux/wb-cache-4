5|$|The new Virginia {{counties}} {{were growing}} rapidly, {{and with this}} growth came trouble. Trigg was appointed {{as one of the}} judges to the Virginia Land Court commission of 1779–80 charged with settling land disputes in Kentucky County, Virginia. The Virginia Land Act of 1779 had <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>this</b> court of four judges in order to examine the numerous land claims and to certify valid titles. The four judges arrived at St. Asaph in October and triggered emigration to Kentucky as people wished to either certify their claims or seek unclaimed land. They closed their court on February 26, 1780, and prepared to return home. However, in March they were told that they had to reopen the court and stay through April, as claimants were delayed due to weather. Trigg and two fellow judges reconvened on April 16 and heard another 134 cases. In all, the court judged 1,328 claims covering over 1 million acres (4,000km²) of land. After these sessions ended, Trigg stayed and established his home on 1,000 acres (4km²) of land at Trigg's Station about four miles (6km) north-west of Harrodsburg in Kentucky County, Virginia.|$|E

25|$|We {{should note}} that Descartes' doubt is a methodological and {{rational}} doubt. That is, the Meditator is not just doubting everything at random, but is providing solid reasons for his doubt at each stage. For instance, he rejects {{the possibility that he}} might be mad, since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his doubt. Descartes is trying to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>this</b> doubt within a rational framework, and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.|$|E

25|$|Also {{known as}} Grosse Isle and the Irish Memorial National Historic Site, {{the island was}} the site of an {{immigration}} depot which predominantly housed Irish immigrants coming to Canada to escape the Great Famine, 1845-1849. In 1832, the Lower Canadian Government had previously <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>this</b> depot to contain an earlier cholera epidemic that was believed to be caused by the large influx of European immigrants, and the station was reopened in the mid-Nineteenth Century to accommodate Irish migrants who had contracted typhus during their voyages. Thousands of Irish were quarantined on Grosse Isle from 1832 to 1848.|$|E
25|$|In India the {{majority}} of these schools follow the Hanafi school of thought. The religious establishment forms part of the mainly two large divisions within the country, namely the Deobandis, who dominate in numbers (of whom the Darul Uloom Deoband constitutes one of the biggest madaris) and the Barelvis, who also make up a sizeable portion (Sufi-oriented). Some notable establishments include: Al Jamiatul Ashrafia, Mubarakpur, Manzar Islam Bareilly, Jamia Nizamdina New Delhi, Jamia Nayeemia Muradabad {{which is one of the}} largest learning centres for the Barelvis. The HR ministry of the government of India has recently declared that a Central Madrasa Board would be <b>set</b> <b>up.</b> <b>This</b> will enhance the education system of madaris in India.

25|$|While {{the backs}} prepare {{to receive a}} kick, the other {{defenders}} will attempt to apply pressure to the kicker. It is usually rather predictable when a side is about to kick: normally {{one member of the}} attacking team is in charge of kicking, and as the team prepares to kick, he will drop back and make himself available deep behind the dummy half, to give himself space and time to set up for the kick. To limit the kicker's effectiveness, the defenders will often rush up out of the defensive line towards him. As well as giving him less time to <b>set</b> <b>up,</b> <b>this</b> action can cloud the kicker's mind, distracting him with thoughts of the upcoming tackle or encouraging him to consider switching to another attacking option due to the sudden change in the defensive line. This combination of physical and mental pressure may lead to a poor kick, giving an advantage to the non-kicking team. This manoeuvre could also result in a 'charge-down', if a defending player manages {{to get in the way}} of the ball very shortly after it is kicked (If the ball travels forward this is an exception to the knock-on rule). This often results in a line break or try to the previously defending team, however it runs the risk of having the attacking team regather the ball for a new set of tackles.|$|E

500|$|... 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925 {{requires}} that [...] "a {{declaration of trust}} respecting any land or any interest therein must be manifested and proved by some writing signed by some person {{who is able to}} declare such trust or by his will". section 53(1)(a) said [...] "no interest in land can be created or disposed of except by writing signed by the person creating or conveying the same, or by his agent thereunto lawfully authorised in writing, or by will, or by operation of law". [...] Two cases, [...] Re Baillie and Ottaway v Norman, have concerned secret trusts over land. In neither case the formality requirements are said to be neglected, but neither judgment expressly considered why 53(1)(a) and 53(1)(b) made an impact that an prima facie express trust could be <b>set</b> <b>up.</b> <b>This</b> has been used to be an argument that secret trusts are constructive but in light of both cases it appears not. However, an express trust may still be exempted from the requirements of 53(1)(a) and 53(1)(b) by a separate application of the equitable maxim [...] "equity will not allow a statute {{to be used as a}} cloak for fraud" [...] the fraud would be for the trustee to deny the existence of the secret trust, but this time the statute concerned would be the Law of Property Act, a line of reasoning dependent upon the case of Rochefoucauld v Boustead. Also, the correct interpretation of secret trust in light of [...] "au dehor" [...] theory strongly affirms that the secret trust can operate outside the Law of Property Act and still be an express trust.|$|E

30|$|In the 1990 s, park staff {{returned}} to routine prescribed burning towards an objective of maintaining at least 20 % of the park’s long-term fire cycle (Parks Canada 1999). Initially, {{this use of}} prescribed fire was planned to facilitate a biophysical paradigm stressing subsequent management of lightning-ignited, high-intensity fires. Burn probability modeling suggested that a strategy of linking the large lakes with managed fuel breaks, including prescribed burns, could be a viable strategy for containing lightning fires within park boundaries (Parisien et al. 2007). <b>Setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>this</b> network of strategic burn units is currently underway, with burns conducted when funding and weather conditions permit. However, park staff recognized that in boreal mixedwood stands dominated with conifers, only a narrow range of weather conditions exists between a controllable prescribed fire and a rapidly moving wildfire. Thus, <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>this</b> fuelbreak network has proceeded cautiously and gradually.|$|R
