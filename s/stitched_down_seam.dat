50|$|Blue serge {{trousers}} {{with blue}} <b>seams</b> <b>down</b> each <b>seam</b> {{and a white}} and blue striped short-leeved shirt.|$|R
50|$|The pleats {{across the}} fell are tapered {{slightly}} since the wearer's waist is usually narrower than the hips and the pleats are usually <b>stitched</b> <b>down</b> either by machine or by hand.|$|R
60|$|It was a dog-skin glove {{stitched}} with red, {{with three}} lines {{of black and}} red <b>stitching</b> <b>down</b> the back. While the glove was produced and examined by the jury, Ronald Mervyn was talking in whispers to some friends standing round him.|$|R
40|$|Short full {{skirt with}} unpressed pleats to waistband. Short metal zip to centre-back with two {{hooks and eyes}} to secure waistband. Pockets in each of side <b>seams.</b> Pleats are <b>stitched</b> <b>down</b> 5 cm from waistband. Fabric is a Morris-type print of stylised flowers in browns cream and black - from the The Betty Smithers Design Collection at Staffordshire University. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{reason for}} the limited {{production}} of the Egg couch, besides the wish for exclusivity, is the difficulty involved in making it, plus a design flaw: the couch is too big to be covered by two entire cow-hides, which is only just possible with the Egg-chair. This leaves a very visible <b>stitching</b> <b>down</b> {{the middle of the}} couch. This problem can, however, be solved by making the upholstery in fabric rather than leather.|$|R
40|$|Fragment of yellowed woven wool fabric {{with two}} smaller, similar {{fragments}} {{that have been}} sewn on. All three were sewn on with the warps parallel but part of fragment B has been twisted and is now perpendicular to the part that is <b>stitched</b> <b>down.</b> Part of fragment A has also been folded over on itself.; Dirty and worn. There are a few small interior holes in fragment A. All three fragments have edge tears. Edges are somewhat frayed...|$|R
50|$|The ribbon {{must be in}} one piece. The {{end that}} is {{attached}} to the stick is doubled for a maximum length of 1m (3'). This is <b>stitched</b> <b>down</b> both sides. At the top, a very thin reinforcement or rows of machine stitching for a maximum length of 5 cm is authorized. This extremity may end in a strap, or have an eyelet (a small hole, edged with buttonhole stitch or a metal circle), to permit attaching the ribbon.|$|R
40|$|A) Dress {{of yellow}} wool knit. Full-length. Mandarin collar, with ends <b>stitched</b> <b>down</b> to form slight collar points. Center front opening with 17 self-covered {{circular}} buttons and bound button holes, two buttons non-functional due to sewn-down collar, and one extra button hole at top in collar, but no button. Long or 3 / 4 length sleeves. Two large patch pockets at front hips. Lined in yellow silk. Designer's label: "Norman Norell / New York" B) Tie belt of same fabric...|$|R

50|$|In Highland dancing, {{it is easy}} to see {{the effect}} of the {{stitching}} on the action of a kilt. The kilt hugs the dancer's body from the waist down to the hipline and, from there, in response to the dancer's movements, it breaks sharply out. The way the kilt moves in response to the dance steps is an important part of the dance. If the pleats were not <b>stitched</b> <b>down</b> in this portion of the kilt, the action, or movement, would be quite different.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the modern short kilt (or feilidh-beag, meaning little wrap, and often Anglicized to philabeg with various spellings) are still debated. What {{is clear is that}} the philabeg {{originated}} from the belted plaid sometime in the early 18th Century, or perhaps somewhat earlier. The philabeg consisted essentially of the lower half of a plaid, gathered or pleated and held around the waist with a belt. Later, the gatherings were <b>stitched</b> <b>down</b> to hold them in place, and thus originated the modern tailored kilt.|$|R

Mandarin collar is <b>stitched</b> <b>down</b> at ends. There are two large patch pockets at front, and a center front closure with twelve circular mother-of-pearl buttons mounted with gold-colored metal rims.

Designer's label inside of skirt, underneath lining, at side seam: "Norman Norell / New York...|$|R
5000|$|This {{arrangement}} is called [...] "drop feed" [...] {{in reference to}} the way the dogs drop below the needle plate when returning for the next stroke. Allen B. Wilson invented it during the time period 1850 to 1854, while also developing the rotary hook. Wilson called it a [...] "four-motion feed", {{in reference to the}} four movements the dogs perform during one full stitch: up into the fabric, back to pull the fabric along to the next <b>stitch,</b> <b>down</b> out of the fabric and below the needle plate, and then forward to return to the starting position.|$|R
60|$|A soft wind {{swept the}} prairie, {{which was now}} bare of snow. Larry rode down the trail that led through the Cedar Bluff. He was freely {{sprinkled}} with mire, for spring had come suddenly, and the frost-bleached sod was soft with the thaw; and when he pulled up on the wooden bridge to wait until Breckenridge, who appeared among the trees, should join him, the river swirled and frothed beneath. It had lately burst its icy chains, and came roaring <b>down,</b> <b>seamed</b> by lines of foam and strewn with great fragments of half-melted snow-cake that burst against the quivering piles.|$|R
50|$|A close-bodied gown, English nightgown, or robe à l'anglaise was a women's {{fashion of}} the 18th century. Like the earlier mantua, {{from which it}} evolved, {{the back of the}} gown {{featured}} pleats from the shoulder, <b>stitched</b> <b>down</b> to mould the gown closely to the body until the fullness was released into the skirt. Through the 1770s, the back pleats became narrower and closer to the center back, and by the 1780s these pleats had mostly disappeared and the skirt and bodice were cut separately. The gown was open in front, to reveal a matching or contrasting petticoat, and featured elbow-length sleeves, which were finished with separate frills called engageantes.|$|R
5000|$|These were {{sky blue}} with tin buttons. NCOs had {{a dark blue}} (infantry), red (artillery) or yellow (cavalry) stripe down the leg. However, junior NCOs which {{included}} corporals, wore a French blue stripe <b>down</b> the <b>seam</b> of the trousers.|$|R
60|$|But Prue {{preferred}} to rock violently, and boggle <b>down</b> a <b>seam</b> {{as the best}} quietus for her fluttered nerves, while she told her romance, received congratulations, and settled a few objections made by Sylvia, who tried to play the prudent matron.|$|R

40|$|Large {{fragment}} of yellowed woven wool fabric with a purple band at one end, 3. 5 cm from the edge, which measures 2. 4 cm wide. At {{the opposite end}} there is a divided purple pinstripe, 2 cm from the edge. Each half is 4 picks with 3 picks of yellow in between. The total measurement for the divided band is 0. 3 cm. There {{is part of a}} folded hem at one edge, warpwise and several <b>stitches</b> <b>down</b> the center.; Localized dirt and staining. Very worn. Numerous interior holes, some fairly large. Many edge tears. Some of the weft in the larger purple band is worn, leaving exposed warps. Edges are frayed. This wool retains some of its luster...|$|R

6000|$|There the {{two pairs}} of rulers met them and headed the long {{procession}} of soldiers toward the palace of the High Ki. First came a band of music, in which many queer sorts of instruments were played in pairs by twin musicians; and it was amusing to Nerle to see the twin drummers roll their twin drums exactly {{at the same time}} and the twin trumpets peal out twin notes. After the band marched the double Ki-Ki and the double Ki, their four bodies side by side in a straight line. The Ki-Ki had left their musical instruments in the palace, and now wore yellow gloves with green <b>stitching</b> <b>down</b> the backs and swung gold-headed canes jauntily as they walked. The Ki stooped their aged shoulders and shuffled along with their hands in their pockets, and only once did they speak, and that was to roar [...] "Great Kika-koo!" [...] when the Ki-Ki jabbed their canes down on the Ki's toes.|$|R

50|$|The Infantry of the Imperial Guard wore a {{dark blue}} uniform with white {{leggings}} for both parade and service wear until 1905. It was distinguished from the uniform of line infantry by a red band and piping on the peaked service cap (instead of yellow). Officers wore {{a dark blue}} tunic with five rows of black mohair frogging and dark blue breeches with a red stripe <b>down</b> each <b>seam.</b>|$|R
2500|$|If {{vertical}} <b>stitches</b> are stepped <b>down</b> quickly, {{the design}} forms sharp points or zig-zags. This type of Bargello motif is often known as [...] "flame stitch". Flame stitch {{can be found}} on the Bargello Museum chairs.|$|R

60|$|Avoiding all {{conversation}} with any one (for such was his charge), Quentin Durward proceeded hastily to array {{himself in a}} strong but plain cuirass, with thigh and arm pieces, and placed on his head a good steel cap without any visor. To these was added a handsome cassock of chamois leather, finely dressed, and laced <b>down</b> the <b>seams</b> with some embroidery, such as might become a superior officer in a noble household.|$|R
60|$|Felipe {{came and}} {{stood before the}} collector. He was a lad of twenty, not ill-favoured in looks, but with an {{expression}} of distant and pondering vacuity. He wore white cotton trousers, <b>down</b> the <b>seams</b> of which he had sewed red stripes with some vague aim at military decoration. A flimsy blue shirt fell open at his throat; his feet were bare; he held in his hand the cheapest of straw hats from the States.|$|R
5000|$|Felled seam, or flat-fell seam, is a seam made {{by placing}} one edge inside a folded edge of fabric, then <b>stitching</b> the fold <b>down.</b> It {{includes}} a topstitched finish. It {{is useful for}} keeping seam allowances flat and covering raw edges.|$|R

50|$|Carrickmacross lace {{is a form}} of lace {{that may}} be {{described}} as decorated net. A three-layer 'sandwich' is made consisting of the pattern (at the bottom), covered with, first, machine-made net and then fine muslin, through which the pattern can be seen. A thick outlining thread is <b>stitched</b> <b>down</b> {{along the lines of the}} pattern, sewing net and fabric together. Loops of thread known as 'twirls' are also couched along the outer edge. The excess fabric is then cut away. Some of the net is then usually decorated further with needle-run stitches or small button-holed rings known as 'pops'. Occasionally bars of buttonhole stitches are worked over fabric and net before both are cut away. Carrickmacross lace was introduced into Ireland in about 1820 by Mrs Grey Porter of Donaghmoyne, who taught it to local women so that they could earn some extra money. The scheme was initially of limited success, and it was only after the 1846 potato famine, when a lace school was set up by the managers of the Bath and Shirley estates at Carrickmacross as a means of helping their starving tenants, that the lace became known and found sales.|$|R
40|$|Fragment of woven wool fabric with brown/gold warp and yellowed weft with 5 cm {{of a blue}} weft band. Two rows of weft twining occur {{just below}} the blue band. The row closest is very {{deteriorated}} and has most {{of at least one}} strand of twining missing. The second row is 1. 5 cm from the blue band and is countered. Each twining loop passes over two warps. There is a row of <b>stitching</b> <b>down</b> the center of the fragment which attaches a narrow strip of brown fabric (10362 B). The attached fragment measures 16 cm x 1. 5 cm.; 10362 A; Dirty and worn. Several large edge tears. Much of one strand of one of the twining rows is missing. A few very small interior holes, including pinholes. Some weft damage leaves exposed warps, especially in the blue band. Edges are frayed.; 10362 B; Fairly clean, but very worn. It is difficulty to distinguish individual weft yarns because they are so worn and frayed. Some wefts are missing, leaving exposed warps. Some bluish fibers have become enmeshed in the brown weft. Edges are frayed...|$|R
