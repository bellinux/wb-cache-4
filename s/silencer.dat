5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the <b>silencer</b> having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the <b>silencer</b> on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the <b>silencer,</b> it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the <b>silencer</b> belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E
5|$|That the gun had a <b>silencer</b> on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the <b>silencer,</b> the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned the gun on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the <b>silencer</b> could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That the <b>silencer</b> was found in the gun {{cupboard}} was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E
5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search for the source of the red paint on the <b>silencer.</b> In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint {{on the underside of the}} mantelpiece above the Aga cooker. DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a paint sample from the mantelpiece on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the <b>silencer.</b> Casts were taken of the marks on the mantel, and the marks were deemed consistent with the <b>silencer</b> having come into contact several times with the mantelpiece. The implication was that the <b>silencer</b> had scratched the mantelpiece during a fight for the gun.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the <b>silencer</b> to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and blood on it, {{and the surface}} of it had been damaged. When the police collected the <b>silencer</b> from them on 12 August, {{five days after the}} murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had gone by the time the <b>silencer</b> arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon. A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the <b>silencer,</b> the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the <b>silencer</b> or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the <b>silencer</b> was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{commissioned}} {{a report from}} Peter Sutherst, a British forensic photographic expert, who was asked in 2008 to examine negatives of the kitchen taken {{on the day of}} the murders and later. In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the scratch marks in the red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken. The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as the <b>silencer,</b> attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece. The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece were found on or inside the <b>silencer.</b>|$|E

Over the frequency range in which analytic mode matching predictions are available, excellent agreement with point collocation transmission loss predictions is observed for a range of large splitter <b>silencers.</b> The validity of using point collocation to tackle large dissipative <b>silencers</b> is established, as is the computational efficiency of the method and its suitability for tackling dissipative <b>silencers</b> of arbitrary, but axially uniform, cross sections. ...|$|R
5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the <b>silencer</b> and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and <b>silencer</b> attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target practice.|$|E
5|$|The <b>silencer</b> {{played a}} central role. It was deemed to {{have been on the}} rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The {{prosecution}} said the blood had come from Sheila's head when the <b>silencer</b> was pointed at her. Had she discovered that she could not shoot herself with the <b>silencer</b> attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence was that she would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.|$|E
5|$|Bamber brought 16 {{issues to}} the {{attention}} of the court. Two (grounds 14 and 15) related to the <b>silencer</b> and DNA testing; the rest were about failure to disclose evidence or the fabrication of evidence. The defence withdrew ground 11 ("the proposed purchase of a Porsche by the appellant").|$|E

50|$|In most countries, <b>silencers</b> are {{regulated}} by firearm legislation to varying degrees.

5|$|Great {{confidence}} {{was placed in}} being able to reduce the noise of a turbojet and massive strides by SNECMA in <b>silencer</b> design were reported during the programme. However, by 1974 the spade silencers which projected into the exhaust were reported to be ineffective. The Olympus Mk.622 with reduced jet velocity was proposed to reduce the noise but it was not developed.|$|E
5|$|The rifle, {{without the}} <b>silencer</b> or sights attached, {{was lying on}} her body {{pointing}} up at her neck. June's Bible {{lay on the floor}} to the right of Sheila. It was normally kept in a bedside cupboard. June's fingerprints were on it, as were others that could not be identified, including one made by a child.|$|E
5|$|Bamber protested {{his innocence}} throughout, {{although}} his extended family remained convinced of his guilt. Between 2004 and 2012, his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. They {{argued that the}} <b>silencer</b> {{might not have been}} used during the killings, that the crime scene may have been damaged then reconstructed, that crime-scene photographs were taken weeks after the murders, and that the time of Sheila's death had been miscalculated.|$|E

The first {{series-produced}} {{variant of the}} T-26 that was equipped with turrets differing from the initial Vickers design (Soviet turrets were higher and had an observation window). Tanks produced from 1931 to March 1932 had a riveted hull and turrets, a <b>silencer</b> affixed with two clamps, and lacked any cover over the air outlet window. About 1,177 T-26 mod. 1931 tanks armed with machine guns were accepted by the Red Army, which had 1,015 such twin-turreted tanks on 1 April 1933.|$|E
5|$|The {{financial}} {{ties and}} inheritance issues within {{the immediate and}} extended family added a layer of complexity to the case. Bamber's parents' estate included land and buildings occupied by Bamber's cousins, who were made aware, after the murders, that Bamber intended to sell them. It {{was one of those}} cousins who found the <b>silencer</b> in the gun cupboard after the murders, with the flecks of blood and paint that proved pivotal to the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|The {{police did}} not find the <b>silencer</b> in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with what {{appeared}} to be flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the <b>silencer</b> during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The police {{searched the}} gun {{cupboard}} {{on the day}} of the murders but found nothing. Three days later, on 10 August, Bamber's extended family visited the farm with Basil Cock, the estate's executor. During that visit, one of the cousins, David Boutflour, found the <b>silencer</b> and rifle sights in the gun cupboard. The court heard that this was witnessed by Boutflour's father and sister, as well as by Basil Cock and the farm secretary.|$|E
5|$|Three prime untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of {{messenger}} RNAs (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally cause RNA interference. Such 3'-UTRs often contain both binding {{sites for}} microRNAs (miRNAs) {{as well as}} for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3'-UTR also may have <b>silencer</b> regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of a mRNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the <b>silencer</b> on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E
