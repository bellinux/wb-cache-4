5|$|As bikinis leave most of {{the body}} exposed to {{potentially}} dangerous UV radiation, overexposure can cause sunburn, <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> {{as well as other}} acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes, and immune system. As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad-spectrum sunscreen, which has been shown to protect against sunburn, <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> wrinkling and sagging skin. Certain sunscreen ingredients can cause harm if they penetrate the skin over time.|$|E

40|$|The p 53 gene (TP 53) is mutated in {{numerous}} human cancers. We {{have used it}} as a molecular target to characterize the induction of mutations in human <b>skin</b> <b>cancers.</b> About 50 % of all <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> in normal individuals exhibit p 53 mutations. This frequency rises to 90 % in <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> of patients with the DNA-repair deficiency known as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). These mutations are characterized by a specific signature, attributed to the ultraviolet uvB part of the solar spectrum. In this review, we will describe different p 53 mutation spectra, in relation to the various histopathological types of <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and malignant melanoma {{as well as to the}} DNA repair efficiency of the patients. In particular, different mutational hot spots are found among the various spectra.

5|$|In early 2008, he was {{diagnosed}} with malignant melanoma, a severe form of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> He had fought the disease before, when he had a form of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> removed from his back in 2006. Cooksey suspected his cancer originated from a six-month spell coaching schoolchildren in the searing heat of Las Vegas in the United States. In April 2008, Grays Athletic staged a benefit match for Cooksey. The match consisted of former professional players, as well as current professionals such as Leroy Lita, Nicky Shorey, Aaron McLean, Ray Parlour, Justin Edinburgh, Iain Dowie, Bob Dowie, Clive Allen, Scott Fitzgerald and Paul Merson. He returned to his former club Oldham Athletic in May 2008, where another benefit match was staged for his appeal at Boundary Park, attended by 1,500 fans to see such former players as John Barnes, Luther Blissett and Chris Waddle as well as television actors from Coronation Street.|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{history of}} {{cutaneous}} malignancies puts patients at {{an increased risk}} of developing additional <b>skin</b> <b>cancers,</b> but there is little data available regarding compliance with any recommended follow-up regimens. Purpose: To report on compliance with physician recommended follow-up regimens among patients diagnosed with melanoma and non-melanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancers.</b> Methods: 105 patients with cutaneous melanoma and 1151 patients with non-melanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> diagnosed between December 1996 and December 2001 were identified through biopsy records.   The records of all identified patients were then retrospectively reviewed for compliance with physician recommended follow-up regimens over a 60 -month period. Results: At 60 months following initial diagnosis, 22. 6 % of melanoma patients and 19. 3 % of non-melanoma patients were still continuing follow-up examinations.   However, only 10. 5 % of melanoma patients and 7. 2 % of non-melanoma patients were compliant with the recommended follow-up schedule.   Among melanoma patients, Breslow thickness correlated positively with duration of follow-up (P = 0. 03).   The frequency of additional primary non-melanoma and melanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> was positively correlated with duration of follow-up among patients with non-melanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> (P ≤ 0. 001). Conclusions: Patient compliance with physician recommended follow-up regimens is generally poor; further research and intervention is necessary to identify and address the underlying causes...|$|R
25|$|Currently, {{surgical}} excision is {{the most}} common form of treatment for <b>skin</b> <b>cancers.</b> The goal of reconstructive surgery is restoration of normal appearance and function.

Zinc oxide ointment is also mentioned by the Greek physician Dioscorides (1st century AD.)
