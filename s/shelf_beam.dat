It {{is important that the}} locking devices be properly installed and remain engaged.|$|E

In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{supporting}} roller producing steel tube AS/RS (Automated Storage & Retrieval Systems) system based on the finite element analyzing of shelf structure and logistics optimizing of system layout. The cantilever beam structure of steel tube AS/RS shelf is different from normal type {{and the strength of}} shelf is one key point in design. Based on the data of raw/residual steel tubes, we first set the dimension and type of the <b>shelf</b> and <b>beams,</b> and then the finite element analysis is used in single beam design and whole shelf structure strength analysis. Based on the characteristics of steel tube manufacture and the requirements of processes connection, one U type production line is given. The practical application indicates that the mechanical strength, logistics efficiency and flexibility of the AS/RS system we designed accord the needs of manufacture...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} analysis of stress {{distribution in the}} reinforced concrete support beam bracket which is a component of prefabricated reinforced concrete building. The building structure is spatial frame where dilatations were applied. The proper stiffness of its structure is provided by frames with stiff joints, monolithic lift shifts and staircases. The prefabricated slab floors are supported by <b>beam</b> <b>shelves</b> which are shaped as inverted letter ‘T’. Beams are supported by the column brackets. In order to lower the storey height and fulfill the architectural demands at the same time, the designer lowered the height of beam at the support zone. The analyzed case refers to the bracket zone where the slant crack. on the support beam bracket was observed. It could appear {{as a result of}} overcrossing of allowable tension stresses in reinforced concrete, in the bracket zone. It {{should be noted that the}} construction solution applied, i. e. concurrent support of the “undercut” beam on the column bracket causes local concentration of stresses in the undercut zone where the strongest transverse forces and tangent stresses occur concurrently. Some additional rectangular stresses being a result of placing the slab floors on the lower part of <b>beam</b> <b>shelves</b> sum up with those described above...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} a concept of two columned <b>shelf</b> stacker’s upper <b>beam.</b> The first part {{contains}} a research of storage systems used in logistics and {{a description of the}} shelf stack’s basic parts. The second part is dedicated to the draft of the pulley arrangement with a rope calculation, pulleys and shafts, in the same the draft of the pulley attachment to the rope leading to the counterweights. It is followed by the concept of the couple winch drive ensues synchronized with the electronic cardan. The final part depicts the dynamic analysis of the lifting truck’s movement in the dependence on the load size and distribution respecting the dynamic effect of the counterweight act...|$|R
