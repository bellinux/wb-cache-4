40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The genetic {{variability}} in and association between 14 traits that affect maturity, yield, and chemical properties of its product. The plant characters measured were: vigor, flowering date, harvest date, yield, lateral length, nodes per lateral, cones per lateral, cones per vine, cone weight. Alpha-acid and beta-acid {{content of the}} cone, alpha:beta-acid ratio, total <b>soft</b> <b>resin,</b> and lupulin content of the cone {{were included in the}} chemical evaluation. Genetic variance, genetic coefficient of variation, broad sense heritability and expected gain were calculated for each of the traits. The degree of association between traits was determined on the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and environmental correlations. The phenotypic correlations were further analyzed by path coefficient analysis to determine the interrelationships of the traits. Highly significant differences among genotypes were shown for all characters measured. The genetic coefficients of variation, broad sense heritability, and expected gains indicated there was a large genetic potential for improvement of most traits studied. Vigor, flowering date, and harvest date appear to have the least genetic potential for improvement. Application of a five percent selection pressure should result in a 90 percent gain in number of cones per vine and yield, and a 70 percent gain in lateral length and cones per lateral. All agronomic characteristics other than cone weight were positively correlated with yield. Also, all possible combinations of harvest date, lateral length, nodes per lateral, cones per lateral, cones per vine, and yield had significant positive phenotypic correlations. With the exception of vigor, phenotypic correlations between agronomic characters and the quality traits, alpha-acid and betaacid content of the cone, were either significant in a positive direction or showed no relationship. Correlations between alpha-acid and beta-acid concentration tend to support the concept that the two compounds are genetically independent after their common biosynthetic pathways diverge. Path coefficient analyses of phenotypic correlation coefficients showed that lateral length and cones per vine have more of a direct and indirect effect on yield than does vigor, flowering date, harvest date, nodes per lateral, or cone weight. The results reported in this study are important to the hop breeder whose objective is to improve yield and quality. The results indicate: 1. There is a large genetic potential for improving most traits studied. 2. Associations between and among agronomic and quality traits show that selection can be practiced on either group separately without having a negative effect on the other. 3. Lateral length and cones per vine have a strong influence on yield. Improvement of these two traits provides a means for increasing yeild in early maturing cultivars...|$|E

METHOD: With a given energy density and for each of two different light-curing units (QTH or LED), the curing rate was reduced by modulating the curing mode. Thus, the irradiation of resin composite specimens (Filtek Z 250, Tetric Ceram, Esthet-X) was performed in a continuous curing mode and in a pulse-delay curing mode. Wallace hardness {{was used to determine}} the softening of resin composite after storage in ethanol. Degree of conversion was determined by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Wear was assessed by a three-body test. Data were submitted to Levene's test, one and three-way ANOVA, and Tukey HSD test (alpha = 0. 05). Results: Immersion in ethanol, curing mode, and material all had significant effects on Wallace hardness. After ethanol storage, resin composites exposed to the pulse-delay curing mode were <b>softer</b> than <b>resin</b> composites exposed to continuous cure (P< 0. 0001).

The control of a non-planar topography would be very valuable since a number of structures that are pervasive in artificial applications (e. g. fibers, lenses) are curved interfaces. This potential of enabling applications that incorporate non-planar geometries was the motivation for this thesis. The first study of this thesis comprises the study of patterning the circumference of micrometer sized fibers. Specifically, a unique technique was described to pattern the fiber with a periodic array of colloids. The effect of immobilizing fibers on different substrates and the parameters that govern a successful transfer of the colloidal array onto 7 mm diameter fibers were studied. Finally, replication of inverse submicrometer patterns onto the diameter of the fiber is completed with mild removal of the colloidal template. The second component of the thesis is the patterning of fabric assemblies of fibers. Composites of <b>soft</b> elastomer <b>resins</b> and rigid fiber materials are explored for their complimentary properties. Specifically, the organization of the fiber structure was contrasted with other homogenous materials. These composites were shown to possesses rigid in-plane strength, yet remain flexible to bending deformation. Furthermore, the carbon fiber fabric composites demonstrate superior tensile strength and greater flexibility than common homogenous materials such as PET and crosslinked elastomers. Finally, the use of a liquid resin permits submicrometer patterns to form on the periphery of the fabric assembly. The final component of the thesis is the use of the patterned fabric assemblies for adhesive applications. Carbon fiber-elastomer composites were patterned with submicrometer shear adhesion. The effects of the pattern size and orientation on the shear adhesion were studied. By varying the velocity of the sample testing, adhesion was observed to change for different patterned samples.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of CubeSat nano-satellites {{shows that it}} is an effective way to send a payload onto orbit, as it is a relatively inexpensive and quick access to space. If the small size of these satellites is their main advantage, it is also the principal source of problems when it comes to designing it. The control electronics, electric power system and the payload are limited in mass and have to t in a tiny ten-centimeter cube. The necessity of a compact deployable structure to hold the payload once the satellite reached its orbit is one of the principal subject of study for the design of a CubeSat. In the CubeSat program SWIM (Space Weather using Ion Spectrometers and Magnetometers) that KTH takes part in, the  deployablestructure developed consists of bi-stable semi-tubular booms made by a woven-composite fabric. Preliminary tests show that this structure is very compact and stable in the packaged con guration while being suciently long and stiin the deployed con guration. However {{little is known about the}} deployment phase, the physical model of the booms is very inaccurate in determining the deployment force and speed, because of the complexity of the material mechanics behind it. Modeling a woven composite material in a nite element analysis software is a dicult task due the structure of the material itself. The ber yarns interlace each other like in textile material, and they are impregnated in a <b>soft</b> matrix <b>resin.</b> Although in-plane properties of these materials can be calculated accurately using the classic lamination theory (CLT), the corresponding out-of-plane properties lack any accuracy for one-ply woven composites. Solutions are found through micromechanical approaches but these models are dicult to implement and are computationally expensive. The solution to this problem is to decline the CLT model of the material in two versions, each with a its own purpose. This paper presents rst a CLT model of the woven composite which aim is to predict in-plane properties accurately and giving a good estimation of the out-of-plane properties. The second version of the CLT model is developed with the aim of predicting accurately the amount of strain energy stored and the stable radius of the rolled-up con guration. The purpose of this version is to be used in deployment analysis. This paper also presents the main lines of a fully parameterized nite element model of the deployment analysis for future use...|$|R
40|$|Silicone-based soft liners can {{be useful}} for {{patients}} who have difficulty to tolerate the hard-based dentures. However lack of adhesion to the denture base resin {{can be a problem}} that limits their clinical use. This study evaluated the tensile bond strengths (TBS) of four silicone soft liners (GC Soft, GC XSoft, Silagum, Mollosil) to two chemically different denture base resins, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA). Specimen consisted of soft liner material self-cured between two square plates of cured denture base resin measuring 20 x 20 x 4 mm. The circular bonding area of soft liner to each plate was 10 mm in diameter. Proprietary primer was applied {{to the surface of the}} denture base specimens before bonding following the manufacturers' recommendations. Ten specimens for each denture base-soft liner combination were prepared and tested under tension on a Shimadzu Universal Testing Machine at a cross head speed of 5 mm/min. The mode of failure was determined using a stereo-microscope at magnification of 10 x. Two- and one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Dunnett-T 3 and t-test were used for statistical analysis. There were significant differences in TBS values for the effect of denture base <b>resins,</b> <b>soft</b> liner and their interaction (p < 0. 05). The TBS of soft liners to PMMA was significantly higher than to UDMA denture base resins except for Silagum where no significant difference was observed. A mixed mode of failure was more common for all soft liners bonded to PMMA except for Silagum while adhesive failure was more predominant in the UDMA group...|$|R
