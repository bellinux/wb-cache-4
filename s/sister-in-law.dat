5|$|When {{confronted with}} {{inaccuracies}} or inconsistencies, {{those who are}} suspected of perpetrating fabrications may compound the deceit by accusing forum members of imposing greater stresses upon them, exacerbating their conditions, or worsening their depression. Users may employ sockpuppets—separate online identities controlled by the same person—to accuse other forum members of disloyalty and persecution, or support the user who is under suspicion. Feldman's 1998 article in the Western Journal of Medicine notes {{a case in which}} a member of a support group for people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome created a husband, <b>sister-in-law,</b> and family friend who simultaneously engaged in arguments with and about the original member; when the amount of attention directed toward the original member became inadequate, she claimed the <b>sister-in-law</b> committed suicide in response to the lack of support.|$|E

5|$|While Vali's {{acquisition}} of Ruma— elder brother taking his younger <b>sister-in-law</b> as wife—is universally condemned; however as in Tara's case, elder brother's widow marrying her younger brother-in-law {{seems to be}} a social norm. Ramashraya Sharma considers that Rama's silence on marriage of Tara and Sugriva does not signal non-acceptance of the act, but rather that he is not concerned with the issue of the sexual relations of the loose charactered vanaras, in which Tara and Ruma exchange hands between the brothers. Ramayana mentions that Sugriva indulges in sexual pleasures of women, including Ruma and Tara, who he coveted. In Ramayana however, Angada criticizes Sugriva for his lustful marriage to his elder <b>sister-in-law</b> Tara, who is like a mother to him. Though a political marriage, Tara serves Sugriva loyally.|$|E
5|$|After 1147, {{however, the}} {{relations}} between the two leaders became friendlier.

Unfortunately for the Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, and despite repeated attempts, Manuel could not reach an agreement with his successor, Frederick I Barbarossa.|$|E

Philip persuaded his wife that Elizabeth should marry his cousin Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, to secure the Catholic succession and preserve the Habsburg interest in England, but Elizabeth refused to comply and parliamentary consent was unlikely.|$|E
