40|$|<b>Stripe</b> <b>smut</b> <b>of</b> grasses, Ustilago striiformis s. l., is {{a complex}} <b>of</b> <b>smut</b> fungi widely {{distributed}} over temperate and subtropical regions. The disease results in the shredding and death of leaf tissue following the rupture of elongated sori. Nearly 100 different grass species in more than 30 genera are infected by <b>stripe</b> <b>smut.</b> During {{the last two centuries}} more than 30 smut taxa have been described from members of this complex. The present study attempts to clarify the taxonomy and phylogeny <b>of</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>smuts</b> on grasses by analysing both morphological and molecular data. More than 200 specimens from different continents and host plants were examined. DNA was extracted from teliospores of 23 specimens from different hosts collected in Europe, Asia, and North America. The ITS and LSU regions of ribosomal DNA were ampliﬁed and used in phylogenetic analyses. The results of Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian analyses demonstrated that there are several lineages <b>of</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>smut</b> fungi. Analyses <b>of</b> morphological characters assessed with light and scanning electron microscopy showed high support for the differentiation of two clades as distinct from U. striiformis s. l., i. e., U. nunavutica sp. nov. and U. bromina. Two additional clades, U. striiformis s. str. on Holcus and a clade containing specimens from Elymus, were identiﬁed with molecular data although morphological differences were not apparent.

5000|$|During {{his days}} at Hindustan Antibiotics Limited, Thirumalachar focused on medical {{mycology}} and plant disease control. [...] As {{the head of the}} research and development division, he led a team of scientists who developed a number antibiotic preparations, including Antiamoebin of Emericellopsis sp, an antimicrobial polypeptide which has reported use as a carrier, as a pore-forming peptaibol, as a de-worming agent, and as a yield-enhancing supplement in dairy and poultry industries. Antifungal antibiotics, such as Hamycin, Dermostatin, Aureofungin, MYc-4 and Tetraenenin are some of the other products developed by his team at Hindustan Antibiotics. At Wisconsin, he developed a set of chemicals, New chemotherapeutic agents for the control of plant and animal diseases, which has since been put to use as a product, Phyton-27, by Phyton Corporation. He documented his researches by way of several monographs and articles published in peer-reviewed journals and his work has been cited by a number of authors and researchers. The monographs and other edited books published by him include Ustilaginales of India, Revisions of and additions to Indian fungi : I, Revisions of and additions to Indian fungi : II, Revisions of and additions to Indian fungi : III, Check list of Cercospora species in India, Plant disease problems : proceedings of the First International Symposium on Plant Pathology, 27, 1966 - January 1, 1967, Studies on some <b>stripe</b> <b>smuts</b> <b>of</b> grasses in Wisconsin, Puccinia Droogensis Butler on Berberis Aristata and Tuberculina on Uromyces Hobsoni Vize. He also held a number of US patents which included Synthesis of pharmaceutical compositions with lactams and [...]beta.-lactams/oxo thia azabicyclo compounds, Microbial degradation of petroleum materials, Method, compound and composition for effecting degradation of crude petroleum and petroleum products in an environment,Process for the production of insulin by genetically transformed fungal cells, Process of producing hamycin antibiotic and product produced and N,N'Dibenzylethylenediamine-diacetylsalicylate, a novel chemotherapeutic agent for pain relief by external application, several of them for processes he developed jointly with his father and son. Many of the chemotherapeutants developed by him are in commercial use under various names such as Jai-Pro, MJN-1891 and Gopi-80. He also mentored many students and B. G. L.

40|$|Ways to {{identify}} and treat smut fungi are given here. Smut fungi infect various grasses, either cultivated or found naturally in the wild. In turfgrass, {{one of the most}} common <b>smut</b> diseases is <b>stripe</b> <b>smut</b> caused by Ustilago striiformis. <b>Stripe</b> <b>smut</b> occurs most commonly on Kentucky bluegrass, occasionally on bentgrass and rarely on fine fescues and perennial ryegrass; it has not been reported to occur on zoysia. The widespread use of susceptible Kentucky bluegrass cultivars has contributed to the common occurrence <b>of</b> <b>stripe</b> <b>smut.</b> <b>Stripe</b> <b>smut</b> should not be taken lightly by turfgrass managers.

40|$|In {{the late}} spring or early fall some lawns exhibit yellow or brown stunted areas which are not {{necessarily}} confined to patches.

Other smut fungi also attack various grass species. During very hot dry periods however, the <b>striped</b> <b>smut</b> infection may become severe enough that individual plants are killed. During wet summer weather, a <b>striped</b> <b>smut</b> infection may weaken plants enough that a simultaneous invasion by other disease organisms may also cause plants to die.

40|$|With the aim to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of techniques and measures for control of cereal bunts and smuts in organic farming systems, field trials were carried out in multiple locations from 2004 to 2006. The relevant fungal diseases included in the trials were common bunt (Tilletia tritici), dwarf bunt (T. controversa), loose smut (Usti-lago tritici, U. nuda), covered smut (U. hordei) and black loose smut (U. avenae). The following treatments were found to be effective. Common bunt: different physical methods, Tillecur, acetic acid. Loose <b>smut</b> <b>of</b> barley and wheat: warm and hot water treatment, seed treatment with ethanol (more trials needed). Covered <b>smut</b> <b>of</b> barley: warm water treatment, ethanol, Lebermooser. Loose <b>smut</b> <b>of</b> oats: hot water treat-ment, ethanol.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} {{irradiation}} (60 Co) on the nutritional value <b>of</b> <b>rye</b> war determined using a chick growth assay. In vitro irradiation increased significantly the solubility <b>of</b> <b>rye</b> solids in water. Total protein (N X 6. 25) was not changed appreciably by irradiation but its {{solubility in water}} was increased. Compared with non-irradiated <b>rye,</b> the pH <b>of</b> irradiated <b>rye</b> suspension in water was reduced. In vitro digestibility <b>of</b> irradiated <b>rye</b> protein determined by a mixture of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and peptidase was increased. Solubility <b>of</b> carbohydrate from <b>rye</b> in water was increased and viscosity of a water extract was decreased by irradiation. In vitro a-amylolysis of water extracts of the grain indicated no beneficial effect of gamma irradiation for a-amylase activity. In vitro enzymatic digestibility of a diet containing 62. 55 % irradiated rye was enhanced by a combined pepsin-pancreatin treatment over a non-irradiated rye containing dye. Dry feces, expressed as percentage of dry matter consumed, were less for chicks fed irradiated rye diets than for those fed nonirradiated rye diets. The nutritional value <b>of</b> <b>rye,</b> based on a chick growth assay, was significantly increased by gamma irradiation (60 Co).
