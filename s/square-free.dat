The operations of greatest common divisor, least common multiple, and division into n (that is, ¬x = n/x), can be shown to satisfy all the Boolean laws when their arguments range over the positive divisors of n. Hence those divisors form a Boolean algebra. These divisors are not subsets of a set, making the divisors of n a Boolean algebra that is not concrete according to our definitions.|$|E

Therefore, if there are only finitely many Wieferich primes, then there will be at most finitely many Mersenne numbers with prime index that are not <b>square-free.</b> Rotkiewicz showed a related result: if there are infinitely many <b>square-free</b> Mersenne numbers, then there are infinitely many non-Wieferich primes.|$|E
