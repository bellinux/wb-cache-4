5000|$|In 1804, Richard Trevithick, in {{the first}} {{recorded}} use of self-propelled steam power on a railway, ran a high-pressure steam locomotive with <b>smooth</b> <b>wheels,</b> on an 'L' section plateway near Merthyr Tydfil, but it was found more expensive than horses. He made three trips from the iron mines at Penydarren to the Merthyr-Cardiff Canal and each time broke the rails that were designed for horse wagon loads. There was general doubt {{at the time in}} the grip that <b>smooth</b> <b>wheels</b> could obtain on smooth rails, and this resulted in proposals using rack or other drive mechanisms. Mr Blenkinsop of Middleton Colliery patented the use of cogged wheels in 1811, and in 1812, the Middleton Railway (edgeway, rack rail) successfully used twin cylinder steam locomotives made by Matthew Murray of Holbeck, Leeds. George Stephenson made his first steam locomotive in 1813 (patented 1815) for the Killingworth colliery, and found <b>smooth</b> <b>wheels</b> on <b>smooth</b> rails did give adequate grip. Although he later recounted that they called this locomotive 'My Lord' as it was financed by Lord Ravensworth, it seems it was known at the time as Blücher. In 1814 William Stewart was engaged by Parkend Coal Co in the Forest of Dean {{for the construction of a}} steam locomotive, which when trialled was reported to be very successful, but Mr Stewart didn't receive his expected reward and the two parties parted on bad terms and he was 'obliged to abandon the engine to that Company'. In 1821, a wagonway was proposed that would connect the mines at West Durham, Darlington and the River Tees at Stockton, George Stephenson successfully argued that horse-drawn wagonways were obsolete and a steam-powered railway could carry 50 times as much coal. [...] Shortly after the completion of the Stockton and Darlington railway in 1825, coal transport prices began falling rapidly.|$|R

Only after block brakes have been either removed or optimized will the rail require any attention. An exception to this rule is rail corrugation, which was found to occur locally.

A round and <b>smooth</b> <b>wheel</b> tread and an initially straight and non-corrugated rail surface are assumed in the present optimisation study. Asymmetric linear three-dimensional beam structure model of a finite length of the track is suggested including rail, pads, sleepers and ballast with spatially non-proportional damping. Transient bending tensions in sleepers and rail are calculated. The influence of eight selected track parameters on the dynamic behaviour of the track is investigated. A two-level fractional factorial design method is used in the search for a combination of numerical levels of these parameters making the maximum bending tensions the minimum.

40|$|Abstract: Optimum {{planning}} for heavy construction equipment {{is a vital}} task in succeeding the construction projects. In a construction plan one should significantly concentrate on the type, number and schedule of presence of the equipment at the project site. In this paper, we have studied the hourly production of a model of dozer, a wheel-type loader, a crawler-type loader, a grader, a crawler-type excavator, a sheepsfoot roller and a <b>smooth</b> <b>wheel</b> roller, {{at the site of}} several earth-fill dams around Iran. Each model was individually considered and the site conditions were taken into account. The nominal hourly production of the equipment was derived according to the data obtained from Caterpillar, Komatsu, and Volvo manufacturers. The actual production was calculated according to the statistical data from various earth-fill dams in Iran. The derived results showed that the actual production of a sheepsfoot roller had the least difference with its nominal production; whilst the loader had the most difference in actual and nominal production (i. e. it had the lowest working efficiency) ...|$|E
40|$|Road {{friction}} information {{is very important}} for vehicle active braking control systems such as ABS, ASR, or ESP. It is not easy to estimate the tire/road friction forces and coefficient accurately because of the nonlinear system, parameters uncertainties, and signal noises. In this paper, a robust and effective tire/road friction estimation algorithm for ABS is proposed, and its performance is further discussed by simulation and experiment. The tire forces were observed by the discrete Kalman filter, and the road friction coefficient was estimated by the recursive least square method consequently. Then, the proposed algorithm was analysed and verified by simulation and road test. A sliding mode based ABS with <b>smooth</b> <b>wheel</b> slip ratio control and a threshold based ABS by pulse pressure control with significant fluctuations were used for the simulation. Finally, road tests were carried out in both winter and summer by the car equipped with the same threshold based ABS, and the algorithm was evaluated on different road surfaces.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{dynamics of}} a two-phase flow around a rotating solid body. Under consideration {{is a model}} of a gear wheel in a gearbox which rotates and is partially submerged in oil. The flow of interest is complex and involves effects of free surface dynamics, rotation, and formation of bubbles and drops. Occurring flow regimes include laminar, transitional and turbulent. The major focus of the investigation is on details of the developed flow, and the purpose is validation of numerical methods developed for design and optimization of such components. Current experiments are performed in a test rig which is modelling a generic simplified gearbox with a single isolated rotating wheel. The flow measurements are carried out by using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and the test rig is specially designed for this purpose with the optical access maximized. The flow similarity with respect to a real gearbox is fully maintained and the working fluid is a transparent mineral oil. The PIV measurements are performed at four different rotation speeds for two different wheel configurations in order to cover a spectrum of operational conditions needed for numerical modelling. The emphasis is on the result of experiments on a <b>smooth</b> <b>wheel.</b> The measurements are providing velocity distribution around the wheel and details on bubble and drop distribution...|$|E
40|$|A {{state-of-the-art}} {{study on}} ground-borne vibration induced by railway turnouts (switches & crossings) is presented. Vibration generating mechanisms and possibilities for cost-effective mitigation measures are discussed. A brief literature survey {{and examples of}} results from vibration measurements performed by the Schweizerische Bundesbahnen (SBB) are presented. The present work was performed within the EU FP 7 project RIVAS (Railway Induced Vibration Abatement Solutions). Mitigation measures for turnouts described in the literature mainly aim at reducing the dynamic wheel-rail contact force (impact load) in the crossing panel. This is supported by field observations of amplified ground-borne vibration at turnouts, indicating {{that there is a}} need to improve the design of these track components. A <b>smooth</b> <b>wheel</b> transition between wing rail and crossing nose is important to achieve low energy impacts on the crossing. Measures to mitigate the vibrations include the use of soft or stiff Under Sleeper Pads (USP) for better and more stable turnout geometry over time. The use of USP may also reduce the magnitude of vibrations transferred from turnout to soil. Other measures include improving the design of the crossing panel (material and geometry of crossing nose and wing rails) and the use of more resilient rail pads. Results from a Swiss test campaign at two different sites (Rubigen and Le Landeron), using stiff USP in four turnouts, are presented and compared to results from four nominal turnouts without USP. However, the vibrations measured at Le Landeron, and even more so for Rubigen, seem to be significantly influenced by the turnout and soil conditions. It is important to accurately determine the condition of each turnout to enable a meaningful comparison between the turnouts and to draw conclusions on the influence of turnout mitigation measures on vibration emission. The best approach to reduce the amplification of vibration is a system approach where different parameters (such as rail profiles, rail material, resilient layers) are designed to interact in a harmonious and robust way. It is thus important to identify the combination of parameters that defines the design of an optimum turnout. Modelling is required to optimize the wheel transition over the crossing panel. Further tests are needed to define the relevant geometric parameters influencing the wheel trajectory and the amplified vibrations. If an improvement of the dynamic wheel-rail interaction (wheel transition) can be accomplished that reduces impact loads on the crossing panel, both vibration magnitudes and the need for crossing panel maintenance can be reduced...|$|E

2500|$|Born in Wylam in 1786, Timothy Hackworth was {{the eldest}} son of John Hackworth who {{occupied}} the position of foreman blacksmith at Wylam Colliery {{until his death in}} 1804; the father had already acquired a considerable reputation as a mechanical worker and boiler maker. At the end of his apprenticeship in 1807 Timothy took over his father's position. Since 1804, the mine owner, Christopher Blackett had been investigating the possibilities of working the mine's short [...] colliery tramroad by steam traction. Blackett set up a four-man working group including himself, William Hedley, the viewer; Timothy Hackworth, the new foreman smith and Jonathan Foster, a [...] "wright". The first step in 1808 was the relaying of the Wylam tramway with cast iron plates, until then a simple timber-way. In 1811, the four-man team began investigating the adhesive properties of <b>smooth</b> <b>wheels</b> using a manually operated carriage propelled by a maximum of four men, and in the same year a single-cylinder locomotive devised by one Waters, reportedly on the Trevithick model, was built and tried for a few months with erratic results.|$|R

Those made by Robey & Co. used their standard steam wagon engine and pistol boiler fitted in a girder frame with rolls and a chain drive to produce a quick-reversing roller suitable for modern road surfaces such as tarmacadam and bituminous asphalt. A number of Robey & Co. tandem rollers were modified to make a further variant, the tri-tandem, which was a tandem with a third roll, mounted directly behind the rear one. Robey supplied the parts, but the modification was undertaken by Goodes of Royston. Ten tandem and two tri-tandem Robey rollers survive in preservation, and one of the tri-tandems is known to have been used to construct parts of the M1 motorway.|$|R

5000|$|Modern beveled {{glass is}} machine made. The {{automation}} of this traditionally hand made craft was {{facilitated by the}} development of plastic based metal deburring wheels which provided adequate smoothing of the ground glass face without the difficulties involved with traditional aluminum oxide and natural sandstone smoothing stones. The best natural smoothing stones came from a quarry in Newcastle, England and would be round wheels with a central hole several feet in diameter and 8" [...] thick. The stone's quality was dictated by the consistency of the sandstone, as any imperfection would scratch the glass being smoothed. These large stones would smooth the rough scratches created by the grinding process. The type of grinding and smoothing equipment depended upon whether one was creating straight line, outside or inside curved bevels. Outside curves and straight lines are ground on a flat rotating platter covered in a thin slurry of silicon carbide and water. Inside curves were ground on a silicon carbide grinding wheel of appropriate grit with water running on the <b>wheel.</b> <b>Smoothing</b> the ground face was done using the Newcastle stone for outside curves and straight line bevels and a cone shaped polishing wheel of relatively fine grit aluminum oxide. Despite the advantages of the plastic <b>smoothing</b> <b>wheels,</b> the crispness of the bevel edge is superior on the stone smoothed traditionally beveled pieces and can distinguish hand made beveled glass. The final step was polishing the beveled face using a felt covered wheel with a slurry of water and optical polishing powder. It was not uncommon to have pieces with a combination of outside and inside curve as well as straight line bevels. The objective was to have an even bevel width, even edge thickness with no facets in the bevel face and a crisp bevel edge. In the early 1900s in USA it was not uncommon to see beveled oval door glass 5' in length with 2" [...] wide bevels on 3/8" [...] thick plate glass. Creating such bevels required two craftsmen working as a team.|$|R
5000|$|A further {{reason for}} {{suspension}} was {{to improve the}} frictional contact between the wheels and rail.

The ability of an 'adhesion-hauled' locomotive to draw a train was much questioned at this time, as {{it was thought that}} the friction between a <b>smooth</b> iron <b>wheel</b> and the rail would be inadequate. Some designers, such as Blenkinsop with his Salamanca thought that a system of geared teeth would be necessary.
