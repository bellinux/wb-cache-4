5|$|During {{the reign}} of Frederick II, Kronborg Castle was {{designed}} by two Flemish architects, Hans Hendrik van Paesschen who <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> in 1574 and Anthonis van Obbergen who finished it in 1585. Modelled on a three-winged French castle, it was finally completed as a full four-winged building. The castle burnt down in 1629 but, under orders from Christian IV, was quickly rebuilt {{under the leadership of}} Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger, son of the famous Flemish artist. It is widely recognized as one of Europe's most outstanding Renaissance castles and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} tunnel water and frost tight, {{the walls were}} covered with {{polyethylene}} mats. Because they are highly flammable, they were then covered in a layer of gunite. Also installed were fire water pipes and ventilation systems to remove smoke. To sound-insulate the tunnel and avoid vibrations spreading to nearby housing, the entire tunnel was covered in a layer of rock wool. By December 2010, the ballast had been laid, and in January 2011 laying of the tracks and ties <b>started.</b> <b>The</b> <b>work</b> to build the tracks and overhead wires has been contracted to Baneservice. The contract for the electro-technical installations was awarded to YIT Building Systems for NOK120 million. As of 2006, the whole section from Lysaker to Sandvika was estimated to cost NOK2.7 billion.|$|E
5|$|Forglen House is {{a mansion}} house {{that forms the}} centrepiece of the Forglen estate in the parish of Forglen, {{northwest}} of Turriff, Aberdeenshire, in the northeast of Scotland. The lands {{were given to the}} abbots of the Abbey of Arbroath by King William the Lion before 1211 and the Monymusk Reliquary was held there. The original castle, built around 1346, was replaced by a vernacular harled house that was later extended. Significant development of the estate began when it was acquired by the family of Lord Banff and they <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of landscaping and planting trees. It became their main family seat during the 18th century. After the death of William Ogilvy, the eighth and final Lord Banff, the estate passed by marriage to the Abercromby baronets who continued to enhance the property and maintained it as their main residence. Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet commissioned the Aberdeen City Architect, John Smith to design the present house in 1839.|$|E

500|$|Film {{scholars}} and historians view Citizen Kane as Welles's {{attempt to create}} a new style of filmmaking by studying various forms of film making, and combining them all into one. However, Welles stated that his love for cinema began only when he <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> on the film. When asked where he got the confidence as a first-time director to direct a film so radically different from contemporary cinema, he responded, [...] "Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance—you know there's no confidence to equal it. It's only when you know something about a profession, I think, that you're timid or careful." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1777, {{in colonial}} times, a modest guardia (fortlet or lookout post) was {{established}} at Humaitá, a place about 15 {{miles above the}} mouth of the River Paraguay. [...] However, a more formidable version was built in stages on the orders of López I. [...] He <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> hurriedly in 1854 during conflict with Brazil over boundaries and navigation, when Paraguay was threatened by a Brazilian flotilla; [...] fortunately for López, the Brazilians were delayed by the low state of the river. [...] The Paraguayan author and diplomat Gregorio Benítes − who was in the Paraguayan army at the time − gives a different explanation. [...] López I, hearing the Brazilian squadron was on its way, immediately transferred 6,000 troops from Paso de Patria to Humaitá; working night and day, in 15 days they fortified that place, including furnaces for making red hot cannonballs. [...] The Brazilian squadron desisted because of the strength of the fortifications; the low state of the water is mentioned only incidentally. [...] Thomas Jefferson Page USN wrote an independent account that tends to confirm Benites' version.|$|E

2500|$|After Richardson <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> on 10 November 1739, {{his wife}} and her friends became so {{interested}} in the story that he finished it on 10 January 1740. Pamela Andrews, the heroine of Pamela, represented [...] "Richardson's insistence upon well-defined feminine roles" [...] and {{was part of a}} common fear held during the 18th century that women were [...] "too bold". In particular, her [...] "zeal for housewifery" [...] was included as a proper role of women in society. Although Pamela and the title heroine were popular and gave a proper model for how women should act, they inspired [...] "a storm of anti-Pamelas" [...] (like Henry Fielding's Shamela and Joseph Andrews) because the character [...] "perfectly played her part".|$|E
2500|$|The {{familiar}} {{story is}} that the stone bridge was commissioned by either Bishop Henry Cheyne or Robert the Bruce, or indeed was begun by the former and completed by the latter, and that the work was done by Richard Cementarius. It is said that Cheyne <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> but fled Bruce's troops, and then Bruce finished the work later on. However, the earliest written version {{of the origins of}} the bridge is slightly at odds with later ones. The first written history of the bridge was by Sir Alexander Hay, in a charter of 1605. In the charter he wrote that the bridge [...] "was built by command, and at the expense of, the deceased most invincible prince, Robert Bruce, king of the Kingdom of Scotland." [...] This account only contains one element of what becomes a fairly consistent story. Parson Gordon was the first to record a fuller version of the story some sixty years after Hay. He wrote: [...] "No man can certainly tell who builded the Bridge of Done. The commone and most probable reporte is that the renouned Prince Robert Bruisse, King of Scotland, at such tyme as he banished B. Henrie Cheyne from his sea, and drave him out of Scotland beside, did command for to sequester the bishops yeerlie revenue to be imployed towards pious uses, and that this bridge (which is lyke to be true) was builted with a part of that revenue." [...] Thus the two earliest versions of this story both put the onus for building the bridge on Robert the Bruce, and neither mention involvement by Bishop Cheyne. This story has been repeated a number of times over the centuries often with only minor changes. In 1780 Francis Douglas wrote that it [...] "is said to have been built by Henry Cheyne, bishop of Aberdeen, about the year 1290, or by King Robert the Bruce, who perhaps completed what the bishop had begun." [...] In the 19th century Camden wrote that [...] "it was projected by Bishop Henry Cheyne … and built at his expense". In the 20th century Alexander Keith tells all elements of the story: that it was started by Bruce or Cheyne, but certainly completed by the former. He favours the Bruce version citing Hay and Boece as his evidence. The story about the involvement of Cementarius is an entirely new one, and seems to be no older than the 20th century. It was perhaps first stated by W. Douglas Simpson.|$|E

40|$|Using {{emotional}} labor and {{conservation of resources}} (COR) theory, this diary study aims to gain insight {{into the role of}} daily strain in {{emotional labor}} and service performance on a day-to-day basis. Strain was taken into account both as an antecedent (at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> shift), and as a consequence (at the end of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> shift) of emotional labor (surface acting, deep acting) and emotional dissonance. The participants were 53 Dutch police officers who completed a three-day diary questionnaire (i. e. 159 measurement occasions). The results of multilevel analyses showed that, as hypothesized, daily strain at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> shift was positively related to daily surface acting and unrelated to daily deep acting. Furthermore, daily surface acting mediated the relationship between strain at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> shift and (a) service performance and (b) strain at the end of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> shift. Additionally, as predicted, daily surface acting was particularly related to emotional dissonance when strain at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> shift was high...|$|R
