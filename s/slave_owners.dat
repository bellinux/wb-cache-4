5|$|In Glasgow, he {{was trained}} in the {{emerging}} science of statistics. He published numerous articles applying his statistical training. For example, he used statistics to refute the arguments of <b>slave</b> <b>owners,</b> who wrote that blacks were inferior and that slaves were better off than free blacks or white urban laborers. To do this, he drew up statistical tables of data from the census.|$|E
5|$|Most slaves {{worked as}} {{plantation}} laborers. Relatively few Brazilians owned slaves and most {{small and medium-sized}} farms employed free workers. Slaves could be found scattered throughout society in other capacities: some were used as house servants, farmers, miners, prostitutes, gardeners and in many other roles. Many emancipated slaves went on to acquire slaves and there were even cases of slaves who had their own slaves. While slaves were usually black or mulatto there were reported cases of slaves {{who appeared to be}} of European descent—the product of generations of inter-ethnic sexual relations between male <b>slave</b> <b>owners</b> and their female mulatto slaves. Even the harshest <b>slave</b> <b>owners</b> adhered to a long-established practice of selling slaves along with their families, taking care not to separate individuals. Slaves were regarded by law as properties. The ones who were freed immediately became citizens with all civil rights guaranteed—the only exception being that, until 1881, freed slaves were barred from voting in elections, although their children and descendants could vote.|$|E

Additionally, 1,785 <b>slave</b> <b>owners</b> in the county held 11,376 people in bondage, about one-quarter of the total county population of 41,130 people.|$|E
5000|$|According to Abeid, {{the group}} {{moved on to}} more direct action in its protests because, “whenever we brought a slavery case to the police, they would release the slave owner.” In 2010-11, the group won a [...] "seminal victory" [...] when it {{gathered}} {{in front of the}} house of a <b>slave</b> <b>owner</b> and demanded the police arrest him. Both Abeid and the <b>slave</b> <b>owner</b> were arrested—Abeid jailed for three months, the <b>slave</b> <b>owner</b> was released after nine days—but it was the first time that police in Mauritania had imprisoned a <b>slave</b> <b>owner.</b> Other protests and arrests of owners followed (the organization has helped to put about twenty owners in jail as of September 2014).

5|$|Senator Henry Wilson, {{founder of}} the unit, was well known during the war for his antislavery {{political}} stance. After the war, {{he became one of}} the leading Radical Republicans in Congress, pressing for civil rights for former slaves and harsh treatment of former Confederates. In 1872, the same year he was elected Vice-President under Ulysses Grant, Wilson published the first volume of his History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power, a severe criticism of <b>slave</b> <b>owners</b> and their primary role, according to Wilson, in bringing about the Civil War.|$|E

He won the canvass, defeating Democrat Matthew Flournoy 38,587 to 30,491. In his first address to the legislature, he outlined an ambitious agenda of reforms, including the establishing a public school system, strengthening the office of state auditor, and combating an increase in crime. Believing that banks should be held to their responsibilities, he insisted that the state banks not suspend specie payments. He also strongly believed in the rights of <b>slave</b> <b>owners,</b> and encouraged Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to cooperate in returning escaped slaves.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton is {{not known}} to have ever owned slaves, {{although}} {{members of his family}} were <b>slave</b> <b>owners.</b> At the time of her death, Hamilton's mother owned two slaves named Christian and Ajax, and she had written a will leaving them to her sons; however, due to their illegitimacy, Hamilton and his brother were held ineligible to inherit her property, and never took ownership of the slaves. Later, as a youth in St. Croix, Hamilton worked for a company trading in commodities that included slaves. During his career, Hamilton did occasionally purchase or sell slaves for others as their legal representative, and one of Hamilton's grandsons interpreted some of these journal entries as being purchases for himself.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the final}} {{convention}} in 1792, a committee composed of Garrard, Ambrose Dudley, and Augustine Eastin {{reported to the}} Elkhorn Baptist Association in favor of forbidding slavery in the constitution then being drafted for the new state. Slavery was {{a major issue in}} the 1792 convention that finalized the document. Delegate David Rice, a Presbyterian minister, was the leading voice against the inclusion of slavery protections in the new constitution, while George Nicholas argued most strenuously in favor of them. Garrard encouraged his fellow ministers and Baptists to vote against its inclusion. The motion to delete Article 9 of the proposed document, which protected the rights of <b>slave</b> <b>owners,</b> failed by a vote of 1626. Each of the seven Christian ministers who served as delegates to the convention (including Garrard) voted in favor of deleting the article. Five Baptist laymen defied Garrard's instructions and voted to retain Article 9; their votes provided the necessary margin for its inclusion. Historian Lowell H. Harrison wrote that the anti-slavery votes of the ministers may have accounted for the adoption of a provision that forbade ministers from serving in the Kentucky General Assembly. Garrard and the other ministers apparently expressed no dissent against this provision.|$|E
5|$|The British {{campaign}} {{to abolish the}} slave trade is generally considered to have begun in the 1780s {{with the establishment of}} the Quakers' antislavery committees, and their presentation to Parliament of the first slave trade petition in 1783. The same year, Wilberforce, while dining with his old Cambridge friend Gerard Edwards, met Rev. James Ramsay, a ship's surgeon who had become a clergyman on the island of St Christopher (later St Kitts) in the Leeward Islands, and a medical supervisor of the plantations there. What Ramsay had witnessed of the conditions endured by the slaves, both at sea and on the plantations, horrified him. Returning to England after fifteen years, he accepted the living of Teston, Kent in 1781, and there met Sir Charles Middleton, Lady Middleton, Thomas Clarkson, Hannah More and others, a group that later became known as the Testonites. Interested in promoting Christianity and moral improvement in Britain and overseas, they were appalled by Ramsay's reports of the depraved lifestyles of <b>slave</b> <b>owners,</b> the cruel treatment meted out to the enslaved, and the lack of Christian instruction provided to the slaves. With their encouragement and help, Ramsay spent three years writing An essay on the treatment and conversion of African slaves in the British sugar colonies, which was highly critical of slavery in the West Indies. The book, published in 1784, was to have an important impact in raising public awareness and interest, and it excited the ire of West Indian planters who in the coming years attacked both Ramsay and his ideas in a series of proslavery tracts.|$|E
5|$|Three Hieronymite friars, Luis de Figueroa, Bernardino de Manzanedo and Alonso de Santo Domingo, were {{selected}} as commissioners {{to take over}} the authority of the Indies. Las Casas had a considerable part in selecting them and writing the instructions under which their new government would be instated, largely based on Las Casas's memorial. Las Casas himself was granted the official title of Protector of the Indians, and given a yearly salary of one hundred pesos. In this new office Las Casas was expected to serve as an advisor to the new governors with regard to Indian issues, to speak the case of the Indians in court and send reports back to Spain. Las Casas and the commissioners traveled to Santo Domingo on separate ships, and Las Casas arrived two weeks later than the Hieronimytes. During this time the Hieronimytes had time to form a more pragmatic view of the situation than the one advocated by Las Casas; their position was precarious as every encomendero on the Islands was fiercely against any attempts to curtail their use of native labour. Consequently, the commissioners were unable to take any radical steps towards improving the situation of the natives. They did revoke some encomiendas from Spaniards, especially those who were living in Spain and not on the islands themselves; they even repossessed the encomienda of Fonseca, the Bishop of Burgos. They also carried out an inquiry into the Indian question at which all the encomenderos asserted that the Indians were quite incapable of living freely without their supervision. Las Casas was disappointed and infuriated. When he accused the Hieronymites of being complicit in kidnapping Indians, the relationship between Las Casas and the commissioners broke down. Las Casas had become a hated figure by Spaniards all over the Islands, and he had to seek refuge in the Dominican monastery. The Dominicans had been the first to indict the encomenderos, and they continued to chastise them and refuse the absolution of confession to <b>slave</b> <b>owners,</b> and even stated that priests who took their confession were committing a mortal sin. In May 1517, Las Casas was forced to travel back to Spain to denounce to the regent the failure of the Hieronymite reforms. Only after Las Casas had left did the Hieronymites begin to congregate Indians into towns similar to what Las Casas had wanted.|$|E

25|$|The most {{influential}} abolitionist tract was Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), the best-selling novel and play by Harriet Beecher Stowe.

Her depiction of the evil slave owner Simon Legree, a transplanted Yankee who kills the Christ-like Uncle Tom, outraged the North, helped sway British public opinion against the South and inflamed Southern <b>slave</b> <b>owners</b> who tried to refute it by showing some <b>slave</b> <b>owners</b> were humanitarian. It inspired numerous anti-Tom novels, several written and published by women.|$|E
