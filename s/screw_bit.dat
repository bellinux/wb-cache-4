25|$|Infinite helical symmetry: If {{there are}} no {{distinguishing}} features {{along the length of}} a helix or helix-like object, the object will have infinite symmetry much like that of a circle, but with the additional requirement of translation along the long axis of the object to return it to its original appearance. A helix-like object is one that has at every point the regular angle of coiling of a helix, but which can also have a cross section of indefinitely high complexity, provided only that precisely the same cross section exists (usually after a rotation) at every point {{along the length of the}} object. Simple examples include evenly coiled springs, slinkies, drill bits, and augers. Stated more precisely, an object has infinite helical symmetries if for any small rotation of the object around its central axis there exists a point nearby (the translation distance) on that axis at which the object will appear exactly as it did before. It is this infinite helical symmetry that gives rise to the curious illusion of movement along the length of an auger or <b>screw</b> <b>bit</b> that is being rotated. It also provides the mechanically useful ability of such devices to move materials along their length, provided that they are combined with a force such as gravity or friction that allows the materials to resist simply rotating along with the drill or auger.|$|E
40|$|There are few {{reports in}} the {{literature}} of complete obstruction of the vertebral artery (VA) due to an electric <b>screw</b> driver <b>bit</b> penetration through the neural foramen into the spinal canal with Brown-Séquard syndrome (BSS). A 25 -year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with a penetrated neck injury by an electric <b>screw</b> driver <b>bit</b> after a struggle. The patient presented the clinical features of BSS. Computed tomography scan revealed that the electric <b>screw</b> driver <b>bit</b> penetrated through the right neural foramen at the level of C 3 - 4, and it caused an injury to the right half of the spinal cord. Emergent angiography revealed VA dissection, which was managed by immediate coil embolization at both proximal and distal ends of the injury site. After occlusion of the VA, the electric <b>screw</b> driver <b>bit</b> was extracted under general anes-thesia. Bleeding was minimal and controlled without difficulties. No postoperative complications, such as wound dehiscence, CSF leakage, or infection, were noted. Endovascular approaches for occlusion of vertebral artery lesions are safe and effective methods of treatment...|$|R
60|$|At {{first it}} {{exhibited}} {{a strong desire}} to topple over and fall on people, but by the liberal use of nails and <b>screws</b> and <b>bits</b> of firewood, I made life {{in the same room with}} it possible, and then, being exhausted, I had my wounds dressed, and went to bed.|$|R
50|$|Some {{screwdriver}} tips are magnetic, so {{that the}} screw (unless non-magnetic) remains attached to the screwdriver without requiring external force. This is particularly useful in small screws, which are otherwise difficult to handle. Many screwdriver designs have a handle with detachable tip (the part of the screwdriver that engages the <b>screw),</b> called <b>bits</b> as with drill bits. This provides a set of one handle and several bits that can drive a variety of screw sizes and types.|$|R
5000|$|Jagger {{said the}} song was about [...] "a girl who's {{in some sort of}} manhood problems", not that she was going crazy but she's [...] "just a little <b>bit</b> <b>screwed</b> up and he wants {{to be the one to}} help her out".|$|R
50|$|I {{would have}} to say From Here to Infirmary {{definitely}} started to shape things up with more of a straight up rock kind of sound. I think the previous two albums Goddamnit are really great, but are a bit meandering. I think From Here to Infirmary is when Matt Skiba and I both realized that we wanted to tighten the <b>screws</b> a <b>bit,</b> simplify things a little and focus more on punching you in the nuts with our rock; Metaphorically speaking of course.|$|R
60|$|His brother Frederick of the dim eye, palsied hand, bent form, and groping mind, submissively shuffled at his side, {{accepting}} his patronage as {{he accepted}} every incident of the labyrinthian {{world in which}} he had got lost. He held the usual <b>screwed</b> <b>bit</b> of whitey-brown paper in his hand, from which he ever and again unscrewed a spare pinch of snuff. That falteringly taken, he would glance at his brother not unadmiringly, put his hands behind him, and shuffle on so at his side until he took another pinch, or stood still to look about him--perchance suddenly missing his clarionet. The College visitors were melting away as the shades of night drew on, but the yard was still pretty full, the Collegians being mostly out, seeing their friends to the Lodge. As the brothers paced the yard, William the bond looked about him to receive salutes, returned them by graciously lifting off his hat, and, with an engaging air, prevented Frederick the free from running against the company, or being jostled against the wall. The Collegians as a body were not easily impressible, but even they, according to their various ways of wondering, appeared to find in the two brothers a sight to wonder at.|$|R
5000|$|Reactions to {{the film}} varied from mixed to positive, with Sodas and Popcorns giving it a 3 out of 5 average score and stating [...] "It’s a nice movie, its different, its creative, but some <b>screws</b> seemed a <b>bit</b> loose which didn’t make the {{experience}} any better than this for me." ...|$|R

6000|$|Here he {{fell over}} a little camel-colt that was {{sleeping}} in the Serai where the horse-traders {{and the best of}} the blackguards from Central Asia live; and, because he was very drunk indeed and the night was dark, he could not rise again till I helped him. That was the beginning of my acquaintance with McIntosh Jellaludin. When a loafer, and drunk, sings The Song of the Bower, he must be worth cultivating. He got off the camel's back and said, rather thickly:--"I--I--I'm a <b>bit</b> <b>screwed,</b> but a dip in Loggerhead will put me right again; and I say, have you spoken to Symonds about the mare's knees?" ...|$|R

40|$|Producing ceramic or powder {{metallurgical}} components with a helical external contour involves: (a) {{forming a}} thermoplastic slip of 0. 05 - 4. 0 Pa. sec. viscosity from ceramic or powder metallurgical materials {{and one or}} more thermoplastic binders; (b) introducing the slip at 40 - 180 deg. C into a mould which has an inner contour corresponding to the helical contour to be produced and which is evacuated to 5 Pa to 0. 09 MPa before, during and/or after slip introduction; and (c) heat treating the resulting green body. Preferably a self-sharpening composition of dense silicon nitride containing 1 - 20 wt. % {{of one or more}} of MgO, CaO, Y 2 O 3 or rare earths, 0 - 0. 8 wt. % Al 2 O 3 and 0 - 30 wt. % TiC and/or TiN is used as the ceramic material, and hard metal is used as the powder metallurgical material. USE - Used e. g. for production of drill <b>bits,</b> <b>screws,</b> etc. useful in machine, vehicle and appliance construction, and in surgery. ADVANTAGE - The process allows simple and inexpensive production of components which have a helical external contour and which have high wear resistance, are less brittle, have chemical resistance and can be sterilised...|$|R
5000|$|... "Well, when I was in Boston, I {{went into}} a {{recording}} studio...Intermedia Studios ... the first Aerosmith album was recorded there. I took an engineering course there....from there I kept on doing things.... I went to my family and I borrowed like a thousand dollars, from my grandmother, my father, just about anyone. Got money from them and I decided to make an album. Something like a Gamble & Huff album. It was like doing a full album with strings on every track. I mean it was crazy, and I probably spent like 15 grand. And then Tom Moulton's brother heard it and said [...] " [...] Oh we love the songs, we'll buy it from you but we're going to re-record everything." [...] So {{this was the first}} time I got f***ed in the record business. Listen up for this one! So, basically he said: [...] "Here's the money, you'll get publishing." [...] Because you know, I'd written all the songs. And he said : [...] " [...] We just want the tapes, we're not going to use them but we just want them so we can listen to them better." [...] So of course, I gave him the multitracks, and a year later it came out as T.J.M. He'd used everything I'd done, and he sort of remixed it or mixed it.So, I got a <b>bit</b> <b>screwed</b> on that one." [...] Arthur Baker ...|$|R
