5000|$|Since the {{creation}} of the foundation IDUM has successfully hosted five international dialogues on <b>Sea</b> <b>Dumped</b> Weapons (SDW) related issues. Their work is recognized by inter-governmental institutions such as the United Nations (UN) and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). The UN identified our work in the 2014 ‘UN Resolution on <b>Sea</b> <b>Dumped</b> Munitions’ and in the 2013 Secretary General’s report titled ‘Cooperative Measures on <b>Sea</b> <b>Dumped</b> Chemical Munitions.‘ In 2014, the OPCW report titled ‘Third Review Conference of State Parties’ outlined the need for international cooperation on SDWs. Apart from working to bring together the various stakeholders that can create effective policy responses to SDWs, IDUM has been active in collaborative research as well. Their work seeks to expand knowledge on the detrimental impacts of SDWs, as well as detection, and removal procedures and technologies. IDUM have published a two-part co-edited journal in collaboration with the Polish Scientific Committee titled ‘The Legacy of Underwater Munitions: Policy and the Science of Assessment, Evaluation of Impacts and Potential Response’ and have helped to create two international documentaries titled ‘Deadly Depths‘ (which won best international documentary at the German Green Screen Film Fest in 2014), and ‘Foot Prints of War.’ ...|$|R

50|$|Burial at sea within Australian {{territorial}} waters, exclusive {{economic zone}} and continental shelf is covered by the Environmental Protection (<b>Sea</b> <b>Dumping</b> Act) 1981 administered by the federal Department of the Environment. A permit is required for burial of bodies at sea. Permits are usually only granted in cases of a strong connection to the sea, for example long serving navy personnel. The body must not be embalmed or placed in a casket, it may only be sewn into a weighted shroud. The burial must be in water deeper than 2000 m and not interfere with shipping, fishing or undersea communications. Australian Defence Force vessels engaged in armed conflicts or emergency situations are exempt from these requirements.|$|E

Due to the extended isolation periods of sea-going vessels and off-shore platforms {{there is an}} issue of how to store and dispose of refuse in an efficient and sanitary way. Worldwide legislation on <b>sea</b> <b>dumping</b> is strict and does not allow, under stringent penalties, any ships or sea vessels to dump waste, gray water, or even ballast water that has been collected in a remote geographic location due to the danger of biological contamination. Ship-generated waste is either held and disposed of in port waste disposal facilities or can be converted directly on the vessel for easier storage and at times (depending on waste composition) for additional fuel.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>dumping</b> {{was used}} by the U.S. Army to dispose of World War II {{lewisite}} stocks prior to Geranium. One such dumping operation was reported on by The New York Times in 1946, 10,000 tons of lewisite was dumped about 160 miles off the Charleston, South Carolina coast. Before Operation Geranium, however, lewisite dumping was mostly accomplished by simply dropping loose munitions overboard. In this operation, the Army loaded the merchant hulk with the lewisite containers, sailed the vessel out to sea and then scuttled the ship with the muntions aboard. Most of the 20,000 tons of lewisite produced during World War II by the U.S. was disposed of by dumping at sea. This method of operation and disposal was not used again for some time, though the Army did employ it again.|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in quantifying bathymetric evolution of estuaries, specifically to determine past changes, monitor ongoing and ultimately predict future trends. The importance and urgency of this need arises from accelerating changes in mean sea level, growing evidence {{of climate change}} (influencing storminess and river flows) and changes in usages of estuaries. Analyses of existing long-term intensive observations in the Mersey indicate their value in addressing these issues. The Mersey is a macro-tidal estuary with extensive industrial and commercial activity, where long-term planning strategies are vital. The estuary has been widely studied because of its vital role in transport (in particular shipping), and the designation of parts of the inner estuary basin as nature reserves and ‘Sites of Special Scientific Interest’. Historically, the Mersey has been seriously polluted by industrial discharges and adjacent <b>sea</b> <b>dumping.</b> A comprehensive programme is presently being undertaken to improve water quality.

40|$|In {{recent years}} new {{emphasis}} {{has been placed}} on problems of the environmental aspects of waste disposal, especially investigating alternatives to landfill, <b>sea</b> <b>dumping</b> and incineration. There is also a strong emphasis on clean, economic and efficient processes for electric power generation. These two topics may at first appear unrelated. Nevertheless, the technological advances are now such that a solution to both can be combined in a novel approach to power generation based on waste-derived fuels, including refuse-derived fuel (RDF) and sludge power (SP) by utilising a slagging gasifier and advance fuel technology (AFT). The most appropriate gasification technique for such waste utilisation is the British Gas/Lurgi (BGL) high pressure, fixed bed slagging gasifier where operation on a range of feedstocks has been well-documented. This gasifier is particularly amenable to briquette fuel feeding and, operating in an integrated gasification combined cycle mode (IGCC), is particularly advantageous. Here, the author details how this technology has been applied to Britain's first AFT-IGCC Power Station which is now under development at Fife Energy Ltd., in Scotland, the former British Gas Westfield Development Centre...|$|E

40|$|In {{pursuit of}} its Antarctic interests, Australia has {{nominated}} a single agency, the Australian Antarctic Division to exercise legislative and managerial responsibility for Antarctic operations. This agency has a dual role in undertaking station development and resupply {{activities on the}} one hand and the responsibility of enuironrnental watchdog over these same official activities on the other. There is potential conflict between these roles and in practice this can result in the subversion of the latter function and thus the promotion of environmental degradation with both short and longterm impacts on the terrestrial and marine Antarctic and sub-Antarctic environment. The situation described below typifies the problems encountered in implementing environmental protection policy by agencies charged with conflicting responsibilities. Recourse is had to policy implernentation theory in the context of analyses of pertinent Antarctic and sub-Antarctic environmental legislation, of policy interpretation and management within the Australian Antarctic Division, and of onsite decision-making. Observations of recent <b>sea</b> <b>dumping</b> activities off subAntarctic Heard Island are used to illustrate the problem of the Division's role ambiguity. Conclusions and recommendations point touiard serious inadequacies in the implementation of environmental policy and to the possibility of improving the enuironrnental record by strengthening the enuironmental responsibilities of other agencies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Over {{the last}} twenty years, {{numerous}} proposals have been made for the long-term treatment of radioactive graphite waste. These plans have ranged from <b>sea</b> <b>dumping</b> through incineration to land-based disposal, sometimes preceded by a variable period of “safe-storage ” within the original reactor containment, {{to allow for the}} decay of shorter-lived isotopes ahead of dismantling. A number of novel chemical or physical pre-treatments of the graphite, with the objective of facilitating its subsequent disposal or improving the environmental consequences of the chosen disposal route, have also been suggested. There are patents issued on systems for transmutation of long-lived isotopes to reduce the radiological consequences of disposal of intact graphite, and for separation of certain isotopes such as carbon- 14 from the matrix in an incineration process. Although these far-reaching proposals are not apparently cost-effective, scope for cost-recovery does exist, i. e., in terms of disposal of the separated carbon- 14 in cements used for immobilisation of other radioactive solid waste materials. More recently, political and environmental factors have further complicated the issue. Nuclear regulators are challenging the proposed length of “safe-storage ” schemes on the basis that essential knowledge on the reactor materials may be lost in the interim. International agreements such as OSPAR have effectively eliminated the possibility for disposal at sea, whilst public opinion is strongly expressed against any expansion of existing land-based disposal sites or the creation of new ones. As a particular example, the United Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to determined heavy metal concentration in water and sediment at selected sites of Sg. Pahang, Pekan, Pahang (Pahang River). A total of three monitoring stations were established along Sg. Pahang. Three selected sampling point is located near Kampung Batu Sawar, Kampung Padang Rambia and Taman Merdeka, Pahang. Samplings were conducted seven times over a period of seven months from March 2010 to September 2010. Concentrations of heavy metals such as Zinc (Zn), Plumbum (Pb), Copper (Cu) and Cadmium (Cd) were determined. The results were then compared with the Interim National Water Quality Standards for Malaysia (INWQS). In determination of heavy metals, water and sediment samples were analysed using Inductive Coupled Plasma- Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) and Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). Results of this study indicated that Sg. Pahang is classified into class I –class II base on (INWQS). The trend of heavy metals in water and sediments of Sg. Pahang is Zn> Pb> Cu> Cd. All heavy metals were detected at low concentartion in water and sediment samples. The concentrations of heavy metals in the river water ranged between Zn, (15. 22 – 52. 91) µg/ L.; Pb, (2. 75 – 12. 38); µg/ L. Cu, (2. 79 – 9. 92) µg/ L.; Cd, (0. 16 – 0. 37) µg/ L and the concentrations of heavy metals in sediment ranged between Zn, (20. 92 – 189. 34) µg/ g.; Pb, (8. 91 – 38. 52) µg/ g.; Cu, (3. 83 – 26. 54) µg/ g. It was found that the concentration for metals increased as the river water flow from Kampung Batu Sawar to Taman Merdeka. This may be due to agricultural activities, sand mining, fishing activities, <b>sea</b> <b>dumping</b> and industrial development near Pekan. Generally, the concentrations of heavy metals were relatively low and it can be concluded that the river status is clean...|$|E
