40|$|Abstract Background Annotation {{of protein}} {{functions}} {{is an important}} task in the post-genomic era. Most early approaches for this task exploit only the sequence or global structure information. However, protein surfaces {{are believed to be}} crucial to protein functions because they are the main interfaces to facilitate biological interactions. Recently, several databases related to structural surfaces, such as pockets and cavities, have been constructed with a comprehensive library of identified surface structures. For example, CASTp provides identification and measurements of surface accessible pockets as well as interior inaccessible cavities. Results A novel method was proposed to predict the Gene Ontology (GO) functions of proteins from the pocket similarity network, which is constructed according to the structure similarities of pockets. The statistics of the networks were presented to explore the relationship between the similar pockets and GO functions of proteins. Cross-validation experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results and codes are available at: [URL]. Conclusion The computational results demonstrate that the proposed method based on the pocket similarity network is effective and efficient for predicting GO functions of proteins in terms of both computational complexity and prediction accuracy. The proposed method revealed strong relationship between small surface patterns (or pockets) and GO functions, which can be further used to identify active sites or functional motifs. The high quality performance of the prediction method together with the <b>statistics</b> <b>also</b> <b>indicates</b> that pockets play essential roles in biological interactions or the GO functions. Moreover, in addition to pockets, the proposed network framework can also be used for adopting other protein spatial surface patterns to predict the protein functions. </p...|$|E

An example is canine hip dysplasia (CHD), which has a moderate heritability and a high prevalence in some large-sized breeds. To date, selection using phenotypes has led to only modest improvement, and alternative strategies such as genomic selection may prove more effective. The primary aims of this study were to compare the performance of pedigree- and genomic-based breeding against CHD in the UK Labrador retriever population and to evaluate the performance of different genomic selection methods. A sample of 1179 Labrador Retrievers evaluated for CHD according to the UK scoring method (hip score, HS) was genotyped with the Illumina CanineHD BeadChip. Twelve functions of HS and its component traits were analyzed using different statistical methods (GBLUP, Bayes C and Single-Step methods), and results were compared with a pedigree-based approach (BLUP) using cross-validation. Genomic methods resulted in similar or higher accuracies than pedigree-based methods with training sets of 944 individuals for all but the untransformed HS, suggesting that genomic selection is an effective strategy.

Access to high-quality multibeam echosounder data (bathymetry and backscatter) has been central to many of MAREANO's mapping activities, but in order to maximize the cost-effectiveness of future mapping and ensure timely delivery of scientific information, seabed mappers worldwide may increasingly need to look to existing bathymetry data as a basis for thematic maps. This study examines the potential of compiled single-beam bathymetry data for sediment and biotope mapping. We simulate a mapping scenario where full coverage multibeam data are not available, but where existing bathymetry datasets are supplemented by limited multibeam data to provide the basis for thematic map interpretation and modelling. Encouraging results of sediment interpretation from the compiled bathymetry dataset suggest that production of sediment grain size distribution maps is feasible at a 1 : 250 000 scale or coarser, depending on the quality of available data. Biotope modelling made use of full-coverage predictor variables based on (i) multibeam data, and (ii) compiled single-beam data supplemented by limited multibeam data.

This paper discussed the characteristics of the major NDs that occurred in mainland China between 1980 and 2011 {{based on the number of}} disasters and fatalities, the affected population, and the resulting economic damages. We further examined the relationships between the level of social/economic development and the disaster losses. At last, we also explored the trend variations in disaster losses and losses expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product (losses/GDP) for 31 provinces in China over the period from 1990 to 2011. The results show that over the past three decades, the number of major NDs and the number of affected population appear to exhibit a detectable increasing trend, while the direct economic losses and the deaths show a slight increase trend. The correlations between the number of disasters and the economic losses as well as deaths and between the economic losses and socioeconomic status were not significant (p > 0. 05), which indicates that the growth in the number of disasters do not result in a significant increase in the disaster losses. Further investigations demonstrate that as economies develop, there are fewer losses/GDP in China over the past two decades. The per capita accumulative losses and losses/GDP in the western and central regions were higher than that in the eastern parts of China. There are significant regional differences in the trends in disaster losses and losses/GDP in China. <b>Statistics</b> <b>also</b> <b>indicate</b> that more than 70 % provinces in underdeveloped regions show an increasing trend in disaster losses, whereas exceeding 90 % provinces exhibit a decreasing trend in their losses/GDP. These results suggest that the economic development may have played an important role in improving the capacity of disaster prevention and reduction...|$|R

40|$|In 2010, 16. 5 {{percent of}} all fatal vehicle crashes in Iowa {{involved}} large trucks compared to {{the national average of}} 7. 8 percent. Only about 16 percent of these fatalities involved the occupants of the heavy vehicles, meaning {{that a majority of the}} fatalities in fatal crashes involve non-heavy truck occupants. These statistics demonstrate the severe nature of heavy truck crashes and underscore the serious impact that these crashes can have on the traveling public. These <b>statistics</b> <b>also</b> <b>indicate</b> Iowa may have a disproportionately higher safety risk compared to the nation with respect to heavy truck safety. Several national studies, and a few statewide studies have investigated large truck crashes, however no rigorous analysis of heavy truck crashes has been conducted for the state of Iowa. This thesis uses the most current statewide crash data to perform an in-depth analysis of heavy truck crashes in Iowa. The objective of this study is to investigate and identify the causes, locations, and other factors related to heavy truck crashes in Iowa. To conduct this study, crash data for the years of 2007 - 2012 for the state of Iowa were used to develop statistical models for single and multiple vehicle heavy truck crash severity. Single vehicle crashes were modeled using a binary probit model with outcomes of injury (fatal, major, minor, or possible injury) or no injury (property damage only). Multiple vehicle crashes were modeled using a nested logit model with severity outcomes of severe injury (fatal or major injury), minor injury (minor or possible injury), and no injury (property damage only), with the two injury outcomes placed in a nest. Findings from the two models were both complimentary and contradictory. Both models found older drivers to be associated with more severe injuries. Both models <b>also</b> <b>indicated</b> crashes impacting and damaging the front of both heavy trucks and non-heavy trucks to play a significant role in the severity outcome of the crash. The main disparity of the two models relates to the effect single unit and combination trucks have on crash severity, with combination trucks increasing the probability of a severe injury in the multiple vehicle model and single unit trucks increasing the probability of an injury in single vehicle crashes. Other factors found to be significant in either of the two models relate to the manner of the collision, temporal factors (season, day of week, time of day), vehicle characteristics, roadway characteristics, and environmental factors...|$|R
40|$|When the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) instituted the FAA {{industry}} training standards (FITS) program in 1995, {{it was expected}} that FITS would mitigate the hazards present in technologically advanced aircraft (TAA) accidents. The 2010 Leon Groff NTSB report on TAA accidents rates does not support this conclusion. The Groff report showed that TAA have a higher fatal accident rate than conventional instrument equipped aircraft. The <b>statistics</b> <b>also</b> <b>indicate</b> that the pilots involved in these accidents are older and more experienced. This is a qualitative study which attempts to observe the effects of age and recency of experience in the completion of complex tasks using a Technologically Advanced Aircraft (TAA). All participants were asked to perform 10 non-flight systems tasks using a Garmin G 1000 ® personal computer (PC) simulation program that increases in complexity (number of steps required to perform the function). The time to complete each of the ten tasks was recorded by timing device on a scoring sheet. The spacial dimensions of procedure, memory, attention, and technique were scored on a scale of 0 to 4 with 0 being no error on a scoring sheet. Video was recorded with no sound to later review the data for reliability purposes. It was expected that the observations would show no significant differences in the age groups for those who have had recent G 1000 ® experience and significant differences in age groups of those who did not have recent G 1000 ® experience (thirty plus days). The results of this study showed there were differences between the older and younger age groups. Older age participants did perform tasks slower than younger participants and committed more errors. Younger participants, though faster, were more likely to make impulsive decisions and therefore more attention based mistakes. Recency of experience was not seen to have a significant role. It is theorized that the reason for this may have been due to not using a long enough time period to observe time and error differences. A follow up study would be needed to confirm this. It is suggested that the approach to teaching TAA avionics should be multifaceted, specifically catered to address the brand and type of equipment installed in the aircraft, and the age of the individual being taught. ...|$|R

The main results, contained in Theorems 2 and 3 below, are shown to apply not only to the Bessel polynomials, the classical orthogonal polynomials including, for example, Hermite, Jacobi (and, of course, Gegenbauer, Legendre, and Tchebycheff), and Laguerre polynomials, and to their various generalizations studied in recent years, but indeed also to such other special functions as the Bessel functions, a class of generalized hypergeometric functions, the Lauricella polynomials in several variables, and the familiar Lagrange polynomials which arise in certain problems in <b>statistics.</b> It is <b>also</b> <b>indicated</b> how these general results are related to a number of known results scattered in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand {{construction}} industry {{is comprised of}} a diverse workforce with {{a substantial number of}} Pacific Island workers whose employment is more often than not precarious in nature (Lamm et al., 2010). Government <b>statistics</b> <b>also</b> <b>indicate</b> that Pacific Island construction workers are over-represented in injury and fatality rates and precarious employment (Jager et al., 2013; Statistics New Zealand, 2013 a, 2013 b). Applying the Pacific research methodology talanoa, the aim of the research reported in this thesis was to investigate how best to manage occupational health and safety (OHS) among precariously employed Pacific Island construction workers. Given that orthodox, single-method, survey-based research designs are inadequate when trying to attain information about the Pacific Island group of people, talanoa was arguably a more appropriate research method to use in this study. Talanoa is the traditional Pacific Island method of communicating and its principles have been used to illuminate often inaccessible individuals working within industries, such as construction. The talanoa approach overplayed all exchanges between the researcher and the participants and informed the unstructured/semi-structured interview schedule (Vaioleti, 2006). The findings presented here highlight the complex set of issues that surround the sample of Pacific Island construction workers. The talanoa sessions with the participants provided an in-depth understanding of their views about OHS within their working environment. It showed the tension between trying to financially survive in New Zealand and being relegated to working in dangerous, demeaning and dirty jobs. Another key finding is that imposing OHS policy and practices onto a Pacific Island workforce that emanate from a different cultural perspective may not be effective. Moreover, as supported by the literature (Loosemore & Lee, 2002; Ochieng & Price 2010), a multicultural workforce can also create unique challenges around communication. The cultural appropriateness must be considered, therefore, in order to accommodate the diverse workforce operating in most construction sites. However, a diverse workforce may not necessary be undesirable as different points of views and varied talents can be drawn upon to create robust OHS policy and practices. The contribution {{of this study is to}} highlight the fact that one of the greatest risks in the {{construction industry}} is to ignore the issues around managing a culturally diverse workforce, in particular, communication issues and issues stemming from cultural insensitivity. More research, however, is needed on how to best manage this culturally diverse workforce as there is still a sizeable gap between the views of management on one hand and the workers on the other. Improving our understanding of how Pacific Peoples view their jobs and what their experiences are of their pay and working conditions will enable the formulation of more appropriate OHS policies and practices...|$|R
