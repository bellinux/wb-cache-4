Three groups of <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations were differentiated based on genetic research (seed protein analysis) and plant community research. The first group consists of <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> populations on Šargan (FMU “Šargan“) and on Tara (FMU “Kaluderske Bare”), where the forests belong to the community of <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> and Austrian pine (Pinetum sylvestris-nigrae Pavlovic 1951).

This study aims to reveal the bio-ecological characteristics of the Igdırdag and Sisorta <b>scots</b> <b>pine</b> forests in Koyulhisar. Also, to compare two <b>scots</b> <b>pine</b> forests in terms of their characteristics. Five stations were determined in each forest.

The amount of accumulated litter on the soil surface and the physical properties of soil were also determined in the laboratory.

40|$|<b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} tree species in the Netherlands (39 % of the forest area), and one of the three main conifer species in Belgium (10 % of the forest area). The management goals for <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> have changed very much during the twentieth century: from the production of mining timber until the 1970 ’s, to multifunctional forest management {{at the end of the}} century. The natural forest types with <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> in the Netherlands are dis-cussed. In Belgium, <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> is not considered to be indigenous. The forest succession with <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> is de-scribed, mostly from degraded heathland or windblown sand to forest ecosystems. Usually, <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> plays an im-portant role in the beginning of this succession, but decreases when broad-leaved tree species become dominant in the forest canopy in later successional stages. The silviculture has changed very much, both through forest succes-sion and change in management goals. The early, planted monocultures are replaced with more diverse forest structures often using natural regeneration. Clearcutting is performed less and less; with many interventions taking place on a small scale. Stand age is increasing, and the canopy becomes progressively more open through ongoing thinnings until the complete canopy is removed.

40|$|Background and Purpose: <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus sylvestris L.) is {{the most}} {{extensively}} distributed pine, covering the whole Eurasian continent. The detection of genetic variability of <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> is of greate importance from the evolutionary point of view {{as well as for}} genetic conservation. Mitochondrial genome in <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> is maternally inherited and dispersed through seeds. Molecular studies have indicated high genetic diversity in <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> genome, allowing the detection of variation between and within population. Mitochondrial genome possesses variable regions in the gene encoded NADH dehydrogenase. The variable region is nad 1 B/C intron. The different haplotypes of nad 1 B/C intron allowed confirming the Iberian refugia in Holoecen and confirming the genetic diversity between different stands of <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> in Poland. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find out the genetic variability of nad 1 B/C intron in two International <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> provenance experiments and native <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> provenance in Croatia in order to detect multiple origin and haplotype variation between provenances. Material and Methods: The samples of <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> were taken from two International experiments of provenances, one established in Croatia (22 provenances) and the other established in Hungary (20 provenances) and Croatian native provenance (Forest office Vrhovine, Forest administration Gospić). The samples of needles were collected from randomly chosen trees of each provenance. Eight samples per provenance were collected for haplotype analyses. DNA was extracted and amplified with specific primers for nad 1 B/C intron of the mitochondrial DNA. PCR products were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis and capillary electrophoresis on the bioanalyzer Agilent 2100. Results and Conclusion: We investigated samples from 42 provenances of <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> that originated from a broad range in Eurasia and were included in two international provenance experiments, and samples from native Croatian population. A total of 344 individual trees of <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> were analyzed. The datawere analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and by capillary electrophoresis. We did not detect variability in mitochondrial nad 1 B/C region in analyzed samples. All analyzed samples were haplotype a. Based on our data, we could conclude that none of the tested samples originated from the Iberian glacial refugia. All tested samples could have the origin in glacial refugia placed in Mediterranean, Balkan region or in the northeastern Europe. More variable region of the nuclear DNA and themitochondrial DNA should be tested on a greater number of samples to obtain more informative data...|$|R

In this thesis, the foliar fungi of <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> needles were investigated with the aim of exploring spatial and temporal patterns, and development with needle age and health status. Using 454 sequencing, diverse fungal communities were detected from <b>Scots</b> <b>pine</b> needles sampled along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients in Sweden and from forests along the Lithuanian coast. Latitude and altitude, as well as the forest edge, were found to influence the fungal community.
