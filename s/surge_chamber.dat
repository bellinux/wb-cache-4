40|$|Construction of {{underground}} {{structures in the}} Himalaya is a challenging issue due to the complex nature of the rock mass in the region. Proper engineering sological assessment of the rock mass conditions in which the structures are to be located is a compulsion {{in order to ensure}} that the structures are optimized, cost effective and safe. Due to the scale and complexity, this is even more important for the underground structures proposed for Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project. Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project in Nepal is a run of the river scheme with daily peaking reservoir and is currently under construction. The total installed capacity of the project is 456 MW utilizing the flow of 66 m 3 /s from the Tamakoshi River and gross head of 822 m. The project is located in the metamorphic units of higher Himalayas. The major underground structures for this project consists of 7. 9 km long Headrace tunnel, surge tank which is a combination of 400 m long vertical shaft and <b>surge</b> <b>chambers,</b> powerhouse cavern for housing six 79. 5 MW pelton turbines and generating units and approximately 3 km long tailrace tunnel. The headrace tunnel consists of approximately 4. 8 km long high pressure tunnel. In the Himalayan region, constructing an unlined pressure tunnel is a challenge because due to the active tectonics, the rock mass is highly jointed, sheared, deformed and provide a favorable condition for excessive leakage. Leakage prediction in the pressure tunnel is a major part of this thesis. The assessment has been carried out by using two different approaches; Tokheim and Janbu approach and Panthi’s approach. Possible mitigation measures to control the leakage have been then proposed. Further, the headrace tunnel for the project experiences a hydrostatic pressure of upto 4 Mpa. The possibility of hydraulic fracturing in pressure tunnel has also been analyzed. This has been performed by carrying out Numerical modeling using the Phase 2  Program. Stability analysis of the headrace tunnel and the surge tank has been carried out using numerical models. The Phase 2 program and the Hoek and Brown failure criterion have been used to determine the state of stress, strength factor and deformations in the openings. The input parameters needed to carry out the numerical modeling have been estimated based on the pre‐construction phase geological investigations carried out at the project area. Finally, based on the analyses mentioned above, overall discussion on the stability of the proposed underground structures has been presented and recommendations have been made for further work. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis was {{to conduct}} a {{stability}} analysis of Herand power plant. Herand is a hydropower plant under planning by Herand Kraft, and it is planned to have a generator of 27 MVA. The size of the power plant puts it under the requirements in Norway stating that all generators above 10 MVA must have frequency regulation {{and be able to}} operate in an isolated grid. This paper presents a conducted analysis of Herand that examines whether the plant will be able to meet these requirements, and maintain a stable regulation system. The conducted analysis was based on control theory. A block diagram was set up from differential equations for each element in Herand power plant. The transfer function of the system was found, and by the use of Simulink and Matlab, as well as an analytical approach, the Amplitude - Phase - Frequency (APF) diagrams were found. The focus in the analysis was three dynamic aspects; the mass oscillations between inlet and air cushion <b>surge</b> <b>chamber,</b> water hammer occuring in the penstock following a regulation when including the elastic property of the penstock, and regulation stability. The challenge for Herand when it comes to obtaining acceptable frequency regulation is concerning the topography at the location. The penstock will be long, and an air cushion <b>surge</b> <b>chamber</b> will be implemented upstream of the turbine to enhance stability. An objective of this paper was to find the optimal dimensions of the air cushion <b>surge</b> <b>chamber,</b> and to examine whether Herand then will have acceptable regulation stability. The conducted simulations showed that Herand power plant will have a stable regulation system when implementing an air cushion <b>surge</b> <b>chamber.</b> The elastic frequency will lie above the crossover frequency, hence the controller will not attempt to regulate the pressure surges. The system will be unstable without an air cushion <b>surge</b> <b>chamber.</b> The Thoma critical area was calculated to find the minimum required surface area of the air cushion that will result in stable mass oscillations.

40|$|Abstract: The {{interest}} for new large hydropower pumped storage plants in Norway is increasing. Such large plants have massive hydraulic transients, and the <b>surge</b> <b>chamber</b> design have crucial impact. The air cushion <b>surge</b> <b>chamber</b> design {{is the preferred}} design for large hydropower plants in Norway since the 1970 ’s, and new research is now initiated {{in order to further}} investigate the physical properties and optimum design of these constructions. A new physical model of a hydropower waterway with an air cushion <b>surge</b> <b>chamber</b> is currently under construction at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The model design is difficult due to huge impact of atmospheric air pressure.

40|$|Investigations of the {{development}} of hydro power in the upper Walawe river basin using the head difference of about 350 m between the two pineplaines of the south eastern part of the central high lands of Sri Lanka had commenced in mid 1950 's. Several studies have been conducted since then on the possible ways of developing this potential. These studies lead to the finalization of Samanalawewa hydro power project in 1985. The scheme envisaged {{the development}} of the potential in two stages. Under the stage I major components such as main dam, low pressure tunnel,surge chamber,a single penstock add power plant of 120 MW capacity housing two generating units were to be developed. Work under stage I was completed and plant was commissioned in 1992. Stage II of the scheme envisaged the construction of Diyawini Oya reservoir, a second penstock and an extension to the stage I power house to install two additional generating units to bring the total installed capacity of Samanalawewa hydro power project to 240 MW. According to the studies the installation of additional 120 MW capacity in the second stage of the project was aimed at providing the needs of additional peaking capacity in the CEB generating system at a future date. The studies conducted in 1985 expected such requirement to be in the CEB system in early 21 st century. After completion of the wet blanketing of the reservoir to arrest the leakage which developed on the right abutment of the dam Ceylon Electricity Board wished to evaluate the feasibility {{of the development}} of stage II of the scheme {{in the early years of}} 21 " century as envisaged ill 1985. In 1999, CEB requested Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau to review the feasibility of implementing the stage II of Samanalawewa hydro power project. During this review the capacity of the existing system to cater for the conditions after the installation of additional units the feasibility of construction of Diyawini Oya reservoir and the installed capacity to be developed in the near future were evaluated. Most of components of the existing project are found to have sufficient capacity to cater for the increased flows after stage II. Some modifications are required in the <b>surge</b> <b>chamber</b> in order to connect the Intake from the Diyawini oya reservoir. A provision has already been made available for this purpose in the <b>surge</b> <b>chamber.</b> Review of the feasibility {{of the development of}} Diyawini reservoir by CECB indicated that the water tightness of the reservoir is uncertain in the light of the latest geological information available. It was also noted that any treatment of reservoir to improve the water tightness will be prohibitively costly. Accordingly CEB apparently had given up the proceeding of stage II studies. However it was interesting to investigate the possibility of using Diyawini Oya waters diverted in the direction of the <b>surge</b> <b>chamber</b> and released in to the <b>surge</b> <b>chamber</b> at a feasible point. This way additional water quantity from the stream can be pumped in to the <b>surge</b> <b>chamber</b> and it is added to generate electricity at the power station. It is very important to check the electrical energy loss when pumping such a quantity of water and then compared with the energy gain at the end. All relevant calculations were done and it indicates that the project is well profitable and impacts on Environmental and social aspects are in favor of the project...|$|E
40|$|The Nordic grid {{quality is}} stated to be {{unsatisfactory}} {{in regards to}} the quality of frequency. The increasing amount of unregulated hydropower, interconnecting cables and increased flow of power on the grid are reasons given by Statnett SF (2014). If the stability of the grid is to be improved, small hydropower plants may be required to provide stable energy to the grid, a requirement that small hydropower plants have been exempt from. Achieving regulation stability for small hydropower is found to be achievable with the same toolkit as is used for large hydropower. Open or closed <b>surge</b> <b>chamber,</b> increased conduit area, increased amount of rotating masses and heating elements or modern variants of such as hydrogen production are all transferable to small hydropower. In addition a responsive bypass valve is proposed as a new solution which will achieve regulation stability at the cost of water loss. The optimal solutions will vary for every hydro power plant and is very dependent on the hydrology, topography and the design choices of the hydro power plant. This master thesis studies two cases, Usma (9. 98 MW) which is an existing power plant and Storvatnet (1. 4 MW) which has received its license. Both cases may be required to achieve regulation stability if the legislation regarding small hydro power plants are changed. A generalized method for achieving regulation stability is proposed and used for the two cases. A key financial ratio is proposed as a comparison tool for power plants which are required to achiever regulation stability. The additional cost of achieving regulation stability is divided by the total amount of provided power in kWh. For Usma a closed <b>surge</b> <b>chamber</b> solution in steel was found to be the optimal solution. The cost of regulation stability for Usma were found to be 0. 26 NOK/kWh which will result in 5 % of the total cost of the power plant. For the second case, Storvatnet, the cost of regulation stability for was found to be 0. 06 NOK/kWh where the optimal solution were a closed <b>surge</b> <b>chamber</b> made in steel. These two cases were compared to an estimated cost of an existing large hydropower plant, Tonstad which has four closed surge chambers estimated at a cost of 0. 08 NOK/kWh...|$|E
