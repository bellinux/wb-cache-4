5|$|Later in the decade, Portland {{upgraded}} City Hall {{by adding}} fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> prevent moisture from eroding the fragile stone. It was {{later learned that}} this process was harmful as the silicon coating sealed the moisture inside the rock. In 1974, City Hall {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. The following year the rooftop penthouse was converted into an employee break room that included an outdoor deck. In 1978, the city constructed a wheelchair ramp to provide access to the handicapped.|$|E
5|$|The Woolwich Rotunda Artillery Museum and the States of Jersey lent {{examples}} of Warriors original primary guns, the muzzle-loading 68-pounder and the breech-loading 110-pounder, which {{were used as}} moulds for fibreglass replicas. The Armstrong guns were built with working breeches; they, and the muzzles of all the guns, had to be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> prevent people leaving rubbish in them. Little information was available on the wooden gun carriages despite extensive research, and a prototype had to be developed and tested before they could be built.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{stricken}} from the Navy List on 30 November and salvage work began on 5 December. The {{holes in the}} ship's hull had to be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> pump the water out and decrease her draft. The remains of her flight deck and upper hangar could not be made watertight and were removed using dynamite. Pontoons were used to right the ship and she was refloated on 31 July 1946. The salvage job was conducted by the Hitachi Zosen facility in Kure and they scrapped the ship afterward. The job was completed by 12 December 1947.|$|E

5|$|To {{reach the}} cathedral, Garrett ventures through Old Quarter, a haunted, {{abandoned}} district of the City. Through {{an opening in}} the cathedral, The Eye informs Garrett of a nearby Keeper sanctuary, where he may learn how to unseal the cathedral. There, Garrett discovers that the cathedral was <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> prevent the City's destruction by the Trickster. He learns that there are four talismans needed to remove the seal: two hidden in ancient ruins beneath the City, and two inside a Hammerite temple (in Thief Gold, one talisman is in possession of the mages and another was found at an opera house after it was taken from the caves below, while the other two are in the Lost City and the Hammerite Temple as in the original game). Garrett recovers the talismans and returns to the cathedral. After unsealing the cathedral, he learns that its inhabitants had been killed and made undead by The Eye. He returns The Eye to Constantine, who reveals himself to be the Trickster. Viktoria says that The Eye requires a flesh eye to function; she binds Garrett with vines and removes his right eye. The Trickster places it on the gemstone, and the two disappear through a portal. Garrett, left for dead, is found and freed by two Keepers. During his escape from the Trickster's mansion, he learns that the Trickster plans to use The Eye to revert the world to a wild state.|$|E
25|$|In the LDS Church today, {{both men}} and women may enter a {{celestial}} marriage with only one living partner at a time. A man may be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> more than one woman. If his wife dies, he may enter another celestial marriage, and be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> both his living wife and deceased wife or wives. Many Mormons believe that all these marriages will be valid in the eternities and the husband will live together in the celestial kingdom as a family with all to whom he was sealed. In 1998, the LDS Church changed the policy and now also allows women to be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> more than one man. A woman, however, may not be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> more than one man at a time while she is alive. She may only be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> subsequent partners after she has died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely offered to the person in the afterlife. According to church teachings, the celestial marriage covenant, as with other covenants, requires the continued righteousness of the couple to remain in effect after this life. If only one remains righteous that person is promised a righteous eternal companion in eternity.|$|E
25|$|Celestial {{marriage}} is {{an instance of}} the LDS Church doctrine of sealing. Following a celestial marriage, {{not only are the}} couple sealed as husband and wife, but children born into the marriage are also <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> that family. In cases where the husband and wife have been previously married civilly and there are already children from their union, the children accompany their parents to the temple and are <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> their parents following the marriage ceremony.|$|E
