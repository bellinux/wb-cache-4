5000|$|Before it was {{established}} that the yellow-billed <b>stork</b> was {{closely related to the}} American woodstork, the former was classified as belonging to the genus Ibis, together with the milky <b>stork</b> and painted <b>stork.</b> However, the yellow-billed <b>stork</b> has actually long been recognised as a true <b>stork</b> [...] and along with the other 3 related <b>stork</b> species, it should not strictly be called an ibis.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stork</b> is a 1971 Australian comedy film {{directed}} by Tim Burstall. <b>Stork</b> {{is based on}} the play The Coming of <b>Stork</b> by David Williamson.

5|$|<b>Storks</b> are large, long-legged, long-necked {{wading birds}} with long, stout bills. <b>Storks</b> are mute, but bill-clattering is an {{important}} mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory.|$|E

5000|$|This {{species is}} very similar and {{closely related to the}} woolly-necked <b>stork</b> [...] whose range {{partially}} overlaps with that of the Storm's <b>Stork.</b> Although the Storm's <b>stork</b> has long been considered a separate species, it has also been previously treated as a subspecies of the woolly-necked <b>stork</b> in the more recent past. However, Storm's <b>stork</b> is characterised by a yellowish-orange facial skin patch around the eye that is absent in the woolly-necked stork; and the neck is black and white, whereas it is completely white in the woolly-necked <b>stork.</b> However, the specific distinguishing features of Storm's <b>stork</b> have been poorly known in the past, which in the field has frequently led to confusion with the woolly-necked <b>stork.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In South Africa, a baby shower {{is called}} a <b>stork</b> party (named after the folk myth that a white <b>stork</b> {{delivers}} babies), and takes place typically when the mother is about 6 months pregnant. <b>Stork</b> parties are usually not attended by men. The <b>stork</b> party is accompanied by silliness such as dressing up, and gifts of baby supplies are given to the mother. A <b>stork</b> party is often organised as a surprise without the mother's knowledge.|$|R

5|$|Because {{the cypress}} domes and strands retain {{moisture}} and block out {{much of the}} sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood <b>storks</b> (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests {{and in the past}} 100years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, <b>storks</b> are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000wood <b>storks</b> nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the 1990s less than 2,000 were counted.|$|E
5|$|During the non-breeding season, <b>storks</b> in the Indian region {{disperse}} widely, {{mainly in}} the Gangetic Plains and sightings from the Deccan region are rare. Records of flocks from further south near Mahabalipuram have been questioned. In the 1800s, adjutant <b>storks</b> were extremely common within the city of Calcutta {{during the summer and}} rainy season. These aggregations along the Ghats of Calcutta however declined and vanished altogether by the early 1900s. Improved sanitation has been suggested as a cause of their decline. Birds were recorded in Bangladesh in the 1850s, breeding somewhere in the Sundarbans, but have not been recorded subsequently.|$|E

5|$|The {{black stork}} {{is a member}} of the genus Ciconia, or typical <b>storks,</b> a group of seven extant species, characterised by {{straight}} bills and mainly black and white plumage. The black stork was long thought to be most closely related to the white stork (C. ciconia). However, genetic analysis via DNA–DNA hybridization and mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA by Beth Slikas in 1997 found that it was basal (an early offshoot) in the genus Ciconia. Fossil remains have been recovered from Miocene beds on Rusinga and Maboko Islands in Kenya, which are indistinguishable from the white and black <b>storks.</b>|$|E

5|$|Azhdarchids are now {{well-known}} {{as being}} terrestrial predators akin to ground hornbills or some <b>storks,</b> eating any prey item they could swallow whole.

5|$|Hunters {{threaten}} the black stork {{in some countries}} of southern Europe and Asia, such as Pakistan, and breeding populations may have been eliminated there. The black stork vanished from the Ticino River valley in northern Italy, with hunting a likely contributor.

50|$|The Yellow-billed <b>stork</b> (Mycteria ibis), {{sometimes}} {{also called}} the wood <b>stork</b> or wood ibis, is a large African wading <b>stork</b> species in the family Ciconiidae. It is widespread in regions south of the Sahara and also occurs in Madagascar.|$|R
5|$|Like others <b>storks,</b> {{it lacks}} vocal muscles and {{produces}} sound mainly by bill-clattering, although low grunting, mooing or roaring sounds are made especially when nesting. The bill-clattering display {{is made with}} the bill raised high and {{differs from that of}} the closely related African marabou which holds the bill pointed downwards.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the turkey}} vulture, this vulture {{is often seen}} {{standing}} in a spread-winged stance. The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria.

5|$|Most of {{the black}} <b>storks</b> that summer in Europe migrate to Africa, with those from western Germany and points west heading south via the Iberian Peninsula and the rest via Turkey and the Levant. Those flying via Spain spend winter in the Falémé River basin of eastern Senegal, Guinea, {{southern}} Mauritania, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and western and central Mali, while those flying via the Sinai end up in northern Ethiopia, the Kotto River basin in the Central African Republic, the Mbokou river basin in Chad and northeastern Nigeria. Black <b>storks</b> summering in western Asia migrate to northern and northeastern India, ranging mainly from Punjab south to Karnataka, and Africa. They are occasional visitors to Sri Lanka. Those summering further east in eastern Russia and China winter mainly in southern China, and occasionally in Hong Kong, Myanmar, northern Thailand, and Laos. They were first recorded in western Myanmar in 1998.|$|E
