40|$|Embodiments of {{the present}} {{invention}} are directed to a simple apparatus and a convenient and accurate method of mounting the components to form an off-axis reflective optical apparatus such as a collimator. In one embodiment, an off-axis reflective optical apparatus comprises a mounting block having a ferrule holder <b>support</b> <b>surface</b> and an off-axis reflector <b>support</b> <b>surface</b> which is generally perpendicular to the ferrule holder <b>support</b> <b>surface.</b> An optical reflector is mounted on the off-axis reflector <b>support</b> <b>surface</b> and has a reflected beam centerline. The optical reflector has a conic reflective surface and a conic center. A ferrule holder is mounted on the ferrule holder <b>support</b> <b>surface.</b> The ferrule holder provides a ferrule for coupling to an optical fiber and orienting a fiber tip of the optical fiber along a fiber axis toward the optical reflector.

40|$|Aim: External chest {{compression}} (ECC) efficacy {{is influenced by}} factors including the <b>surface</b> <b>supporting</b> the patient. Air-filled <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> are deflated for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, with little evidence to substantiate this. We investigated the effect that differing <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> had on ECC efficacy using a CPR manikin model. Methodology: Four participants carried out four cycles of ECC with an assistant ventilating. The subjects were blinded to the seven <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the order was randomised. For each participant/surface combination, ECC variables and the participants' perceptions were measured. Results: Participants produced effective ECC with the manikin on the floor (mean proportion correct, 94. 5 %; mean depth, 42. 5 mm). Compared with the floor: the proportion of correct ECC was less for the overlay inflated (P < 0. 05); the depth of ECC was less effective (30 - 37 mm) for the overlay inflated/deflated and low-air-loss inflated and foam mattresses (P < 0. 05). The foam mattress, overlay inflated/deflated, and low-air-loss inflated were perceived as being less stable and as having reduced ECC efficacy compared with the floor. There was no difference or agreement, regarding subjects' perceptions or ECC variables, between the <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> or between inflated/deflated air-filled <b>support</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Conclusion: The efficacy of ECC {{is affected by the}} <b>support</b> <b>surfaces.</b> There seems little evidence to substantiate deflating all air-filled <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> for CPR.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if increasing the potential risk of slipping on <b>support</b> <b>surface</b> materials decreases postural dynamics and task performance. Seated subjects were asked to exert maximum horizontal two-handed isometric pushes as quickly as possible on a dynamometric bar. Reaction forces exerted at seat (Rxs and Rzs) and footrest (Rxf and Rzf) were measured using force sensors. A dynamometric bar measured horizontal push force (Fx). Global adherence ratio (micro) was calculated. Three <b>support</b> <b>surface</b> materials, characterised by different coefficients of friction, were tested. The same surfaces were placed on the seat and the footrest during a series of pushes. It was shown that the different <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> significantly influence Fx, Rxs, Rzs, Rzf and micro maximum values obtained at the end of the push. Even when the instructions given to the subject are to produce a maximum push, the maximum horizontal force applied to the bar differs according to the <b>support</b> <b>surface</b> material.
