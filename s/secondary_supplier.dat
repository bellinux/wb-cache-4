40|$|Structural {{changes in}} the global {{commodity}} markets have particularly serious implications to the food security of import-dependent countries. Adapting importation policy to that global change is essential given that many commodities are imported to fulfill domestic demand. Using Singapore as a case study, this paper examines rice (Oryza) import allocation for seeking adaptive measures, which have broad implications to import-dependent countries. Its quarterly trade data (between 1999 and 2008) have been analyzed using an almost ideal demand system (AIDS) model. Our findings in respect to expenditure elasticity reveal that Singapore will continue its importation from its current range of suppliers, and add new import sources, fulfilling its national diversification strategy. New sources that located in different regions will also strengthen Singapore’s regional diversification strategy. Both national and regional diversification strategies enable any country to tap into associative import sources when unfavorable events deplete supply from a normally preferred supplier. In addition, the results in respect to own-price elasticity suggest that Thailand is Singapore’s primary preferred source while other exporters are <b>secondary</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Supported by the outputs of cross-price elasticity, secondary sources are substitutable. Within a diversified import portfolio, their competitive relationship gives an import-dependent country a strategic position to hedge against price manipulation and escalation, and to substitute expensive suppliers with cheaper alternatives. For these reasons, an import diversification policy is recommended both as an adaptive measure {{in response to the}} global change in commodity markets and, at the same time, as a mean for sustaining food security in import-dependent countries.

50|$|Following the July 17 Revolution, the Ba'ath Party assumed {{power in}} Iraq {{and turned to}} the Soviet Union as its {{principal}} supplier of arms. Between 1968 and 1970 the Iraqi Army underwent a second major rearmament programme with Soviet assistance. However, the Soviet government also used this relationship to exert political pressure on the Ba'athist regime. Iraqi officials also believed the Soviets were withholding their most sophisticated weapons from export and therefore embarked on a diversification effort to find <b>secondary</b> <b>suppliers</b> of arms, preferably in the West. In 1972 the Ba'ath Party repaid France for not opposing its nationalisation of Iraqi oil by placing an order for some AML-90s. Estimates of the number initially sold and delivered to Iraq vary from 8 to 38; however, it is clear that this largely symbolic purchase was instrumental in re-igniting defence ties with France. In 1974 the Iraqis placed a second order for another 20 AML-60s and 42 AML-90s, and subsequently for 2 AML-60s and 25 AML-90s. Most of the orders were small and timed to coincide with Iraqi requests for access to far more advanced French defence technology, but they rapidly accumulated; Panhard recorded the sale of 131 AML-60s and 101 AML-90s to Iraq between 1972 and 1980. In Iraqi service, AML platoons were typically attached at the brigade or battalion level and utilised for their traditional role of reconnaissance. A single Iraqi armoured reconnaissance platoon may have consisted of up to 8 AMLs. Each Iraqi Army corps and infantry division also had its own reconnaissance battalion with 46 AMLs and BRDM-2 scout cars divided into two companies. Most conventional reconnaissance duties were carried out by the AML-90s, which were valued for the size and range of their armament, while the AML-60s were relegated to secondary battlefield tasks.|$|R
40|$|In tide-dominated systems, {{fine-grained}} deposits {{occur in}} intertidal areas of inner estuaries as loci of convergence of fluvial and marine material. Even {{in the vicinity}} of estuaries, mud deposits are rare on open sandy beaches. This study focuses on temporary occurrences of muddy sediments on marine beaches along the Calvados coastline in Normandy, adjacent to the macrotidal Seine estuary (France). Clay mineralogy, majoreminoretrace elements and radionuclides were used as particulate markers to determine the provenance of the mud deposits. The fine fraction, defined here as particles < 50 mm, was analysed, in surficial muddy sediments on seven beaches between the Seine estuary and the Orne river mouth, sampled between February 2002 and June 2003. The deposits were compared to earlier Holocene relict deposits, which crop out on some beaches and on the shoreface, and to Mesozoic marls and limestones, which have detached from the coastal cliffs. The use of the three types of particulate markers revealed no significant seasonal or geographical variations between the beaches. The muddy deposits were made up of the same sedimentary pool of particles. The clay mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of these mud deposits enabled modern (i. e. present-day and earlier Holocene fine silts and clays) to be distinguished from ancient (i. e. Mesozoic) sediments. The use of radionuclides (60 Co and 137 Cs) confirmed the marine influence in the modern deposits, with a decreasing gradient along the Calvados beaches towards the east. The presence of several specific majoreminoretrace elements (e. g. Ti, P) revealed that some of the fine material originated in the Seine estuary. Despite the occurrence of easily erodable rocks (i. e. clays, marls and limestones) in the coastal cliffs, this source represented a limited supply, which is only of local significance. Small rivers, such as the Orne, Dives and Touques which discharge in the study area act as <b>secondary</b> <b>suppliers</b> of fine-grained material to this system. In spite of the exposed coastal setting where strong tidal currents and waves occur, the beaches have become a distal part of the Seine estuarine system and form a temporary sink for strongly mixed fine material mainly of riverine (Seine River) and open marine (Bay of the Seine and the Central English Channel) origins. This is consistent with the infilling of the estuary, the reduction in accommodation space in its inner part, and the offshore shifting of the depocentre of the mud...|$|R
40|$|Polymer matrix composites’ high {{strength}} to weight ratio has made them an ideal material choice for use in lightweight transportation vehicles. Aptera Motors, a company based out of Oceanside, CA, is currently developing a next-generation high efficiency passenger vehicle called the Aptera 2 e. The 2 e’s body is composed of a sandwich core composite containing laminates of E-glass fibers embedded within an epoxy matrix sandwiched between a polyester hexagonal core. This project looked to validate a <b>secondary</b> fabric <b>supplier</b> for use in Aptera’s composite and characterize the core shear properties of two alternate core materials for future iterations of Aptera’s vehicle. Validation of the <b>secondary</b> fabric <b>supplier</b> was achieved by experimentally determining and comparing the tensile strength and modulus, in-plane shear strength, and short-beam strength of laminates containing Aptera’s current fabric (Vectorply) and alternate fabric (Saertex). All mechanical testing followed appropriate ASTM standards (D 3039, D 3518, D 2344). Using a two sample t-test, the mechanical properties of the laminates were determined to be statistically different. Laminates that contained Saertex fabrics had a greater mean tensile strength and modulus than laminates with Vectorply fabrics (95 % CI: 7 - 29 MPa and 0. 3 - 1. 5 GPa, respectively). The mean short beam strength of laminates containing Saertex fabrics was also statistically greater than those containing Vectorply fabrics (95 % CI: 4. 6 - 7. 3 MPa). Fracture surfaces of the two fibers were examined with a scanning electron microscope to qualitatively compare the adhesion at the fiber-matrix interface. Fibers within Saertex fabrics appeared to have greater adhesion at the fiber-matrix interface compared to Vectorply. Characterization of the alternate core materials was accomplished by measuring the core shear strength and flexural modulus of the composite in three-point bending following ASTM C 373. The mechanical properties of the two alternate cores (TF 2, LRC 3) were compared to Aptera’s current core material (XF 6). The TF 2 core exhibited a greater mean core shear strength than XF 6 (95 % CI: 0. 77 - 0. 96 MPa), while LRC 3 was less then XF 6 (95 % CI: 0. 25 - 0. 45 MPa). There was no statistical difference between the flexural modulus of the XF 6 and TF 2 cores, whereas LRC 3 ’s flexural modulus was statistically less than XF 6 (95 % CI: 0. 35 - 0. 87 GPa). The difference in core shear properties was attributed to the varying amount of resin uptake of the various cores during the fabrication process...|$|R

Forestry’s recent advancements {{are the product of}} decades of ongoing collaboration among market and environmental experts seeking to strike an ideal balance between forestry projects’ market risks and shared benefits. Market dynamics in 2011 demonstrated that these efforts have never been more pivotal, or complex, as forest carbon projects mature – and find themselves positioned squarely in the midst of some of today’s most challenging policy debates. This year, a record number of forest project developers and <b>secondary</b> market <b>suppliers</b> from around the world shared data about their projects and transactions. This third annual State of the Forest Carbon Markets tracks, reports, and analyzes trends in these responses. This information is primarily based on data collected from respondents to Ecosystem Marketplace’s 2011 forest carbon project developer’s survey, combined with data from the 2012 State of the Voluntary Carbon Markets report.

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{analytical}} framework {{to investigate the}} competitive implications of electronic secondary markets which promote concurrent selling of new and used goods. In <b>secondary</b> markets where <b>suppliers</b> cannot directly use second-hand goods for practicing inter-temporal price discrimination, the threat of cannibalization of new goods by used goods become significant. We examine conditions under which it is optimal for suppliers to operate in such markets, explaining why these markets {{may not always be}} a threat to <b>suppliers.</b> Intuitively, <b>secondary</b> markets provide an active outlet for some consumers to sell their second-hand (used) goods. Such sales lead to an increase in their valuation for the new good due to the potential for an increase in the disposable income from resale. This increased valuation leads them to to buy an additional new good. Thus the âincome effectâ can mitigate the losses incurred by suppliers from the direct âcannibalization effectâ in the presence of secondary markets. We highlight the strategic role which used goods commission set by the retailer plays in determining profits for suppliers. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our model predicts the reduction in the price of new goods with an increase in the availability of used goods. Further, we show that as the used good price increases, the new good price also increases. We conclude the paper by empirically testing some implications of our model using data from the online book industry. ...|$|R

Especially to companies who focus on sustainability, purchasing is important, because purchasing can function as a gateway and prevent companies from reputational damage at other entities in the supply chain. On the other hand, also SMEs start to recognise the contribution that purchasing can make to a company’s performance. This research uses {{a combination of a}} survey and grounded theory approach to discover whether there are differences between sustainable companies and SMEs related to the amount of strategic relationships and the way they manage their strategic relationships with <b>suppliers.</b> <b>Secondary</b> data from thirty-two SMEs and thirty-nine sustainable companies in the Netherlands, combined with data from ten interviews (five SMEs and five sustainable companies) was gathered.

Other findings are that strategic relationships are dependent on the kind of product and trust. Reasons to be involved in strategic relationships with suppliers are satisfaction with a supplier’s performance and third party influences, whereas reasons to avoid strategic relationships are dependency, previous experiences, the type of company, and financial instability.

40|$|The thesis {{evaluates the}} impact of {{just-in-time}} (JIT) strategies on retailers and cut make and trim (CMT) manufacturers within the apparel supply chain. A simulation approach is adopted based on a case study within the apparel sector, involving a major high street retailer and a manufacturing supply chain. A range of procurement strategies are subsequently modelled (including manufacturing resource planning [MRPII], safety stock [SS]. ship to forecast [STF] and JIT) within manufacturers of differing scale, and varying levels of dependence on primary customers (major high street retail chains) and impact on the variation of demand against forecast are evaluated against {{a wide range of}} parameters; these include: net margin, delivery, manufacturing profit and impact on a manufacturing company's ability to satisfy its secondary customers (smaller retail outlets with less buying power). Analytical methods are used to evaluate performance measures within three perspectives: Primary and <b>Secondary</b> customers, and <b>Suppliers</b> (manufacturers). A further perspective is evaluated combining all three views. Findings indicate that JIT retail strategies, notably where power of the retailer is high {{and the power of the}} manufacturer is low (compared to the raw material supplier), necessitate inventory holding and biased work scheduling at a supply level, leading to reduced manufacturing margin and loss of secondary customers; the latter imposes hidden costs in attracting new custom, which is not evaluated in this thesis. The thesis concludes by comparing the variation of parameters across each of the four perspectives, and proposes recommendations for conventional JIT policy, based upon optimising benefits for all parties within the supply chain.
