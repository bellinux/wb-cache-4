5000|$|When large format film is <b>contact</b> <b>printed</b> {{to create}} {{finished}} work, it is possible, but not easy, to use local controls {{to interpret the}} image on the negative. [...] "Burning" [...] and [...] "dodging" [...] (either increasing the amount of light that one area of the print receives, or decreasing the amount of light in order to achieve the ideal tonal range in a particular area) require painstaking work with photographic masks, or the use of a production <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> machine (Arkay, Morse, Burke and James are manufacturers who make <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> machines).|$|R
5000|$|Photographers {{generally}} begin printing {{a roll of}} film {{by making}} a <b>contact</b> <b>print</b> of their negatives {{to use as a}} quick reference to decide which images to enlarge.

A QD-LED was fabricated with an emissive layer consisting of 25-µm wide stripes of red, {{green and blue}} QD monolayers. <b>Contact</b> <b>printing</b> methods also minimize the amount of QD required, reducing costs. The demonstrated color gamut from QD-LEDs exceeds the performance of both LCD and OLED display technologies.|$|R

40|$|Novel {{thin film}} {{optoelectronic}} devices containing both inorganic colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and organic semiconductor thin films {{have been widely}} investigated in recent years {{for a variety of}} applications. Here, we review one of the most versatile and successful methods developed to integrate these two dissimilar material classes into a functional multilayered device: <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> of colloidal QD films. Experimental details regarding the <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> process are outlined, and the key advantages of this QD deposition method over other commonly encountered techniques are discussed. The use of tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) to effectively characterize QD film morphology both on an elastomeric stamp (before <b>contact</b> <b>printing)</b> and as-transferred to the organic semiconductor receiving film (after <b>contact</b> <b>printing)</b> is also described. Finally, we offer suggestions for future efforts directed toward the goal of rapid, continuous QD deposition over larger substrates for the advancement of hybrid optoelectronic thin film devices...|$|R
50|$|Since {{this process}} {{produces}} neither enlargements nor reductions, {{the image on}} the print is exactly the same size as {{the image on the}} negative. <b>Contact</b> <b>prints</b> are used to produce proof sheets from entire rolls of 35 mm negative (from 135 film cassettes) and 120 (2 film rolls) in order to aid in the selection of images for further enlargement, and for cataloging and identification purposes. For 120 roll film (once a common negative size for popular cameras) and larger film, <b>contact</b> <b>prints</b> are often used to determine the final print size. In medium and large format photography, <b>contact</b> <b>prints</b> are prized for their extreme fidelity to the negative, with exquisite detail that can be seen with the use of a magnifying glass. A disadvantage to using <b>contact</b> <b>prints</b> in the fine-arts is the laboriousness of modifying exposure selectively, when the use of an enlarger can achieve the same purpose.|$|R

The thesis takes the reader through an extensive literature review of the suite of soft lithography techniques - Near Field Soft Optical Lithography, Replica Molding and Micro <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> - focused on the critical factors for taking these techniques from research facilities to commercial manufacturing facilities. Micro <b>Contact</b> <b>Printing</b> was studied more extensively than the others.

50|$|Often {{however, they}} are used {{with one of the}} {{alternative}} processes such as Inkodye or cyanotype.

Smaller <b>contact</b> <b>prints,</b> from films and formats such as 135 film cassettes, 35 mm (24×36 mm images), and 120/220 roll film (6 cm), are useful for evaluation of exposure, composition, and subject.|$|R

50|$|Baldus {{was well}} known {{throughout}} France for his efforts in photography. One of his greatest assignments was to document {{the construction of the}} Louvre museum. He used wet and dry paper negatives as large as 10x14 inches in size. From these negatives, he made <b>contact</b> <b>prints.</b> In order to create a larger image, he put <b>contact</b> <b>prints</b> side by side to create a panoramic effect. He was renowned for the sheer size of his pictures, which ranged up to eight feet long for one panorama from around 1855, made from several negatives.|$|R
50|$|To apply a {{homogeneous}} pressure during the printing step, a magnetic force is used.

5000|$|Computer {{screens and}} other {{electronic}} display devices provide {{an alternative approach}} to <b>contact</b> <b>printing.</b> A permanent image (negative, positive film or transparency, or translucent original) is not used, instead the light sensitive material is exposed directly to the display device {{in a dark room}} for a controllable duration. The resulting image generated by this mixed digital/analogue technique has been coined [...] "laptopogram". While limited by the image display device resolution, which can be much inferior to film negatives, the widespread use of electronic displays provides great potential to this unorthodox <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> method.|$|R

50|$|Research and {{prototyping}} processes {{often use}} contact or proximity lithography, because it uses inexpensive hardware and can achieve high optical resolution. The resolution in proximity lithography is approximately the square {{root of the}} product of the wavelength and the gap distance. Hence, except for projection lithography (see below), <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> offers the best resolution, because its gap distance is approximately zero (neglecting the thickness of the photoresist itself). In addition, nanoimprint lithography may revive interest in this familiar technique, especially since the cost of ownership is expected to be low; however, the shortcomings of <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> discussed above remain as challenges.|$|R
