40|$|It is of high actual {{importance}} to clarify historical climate variations and their impact, {{because it is}} not possible to predict future developments and its motors, if the past way of climate is not understood. The Decapolis area in northern Jordan provides excellent opportunities to investigate this question. Environmental change could have been responsible for the abandonment of the area, caused by human activities or climate variation. Recent investigations let the climatic possibility seem more and more likely, because climatic models match very well to the historical development, while mismanagement becomes less probable, as it is evident that medieval Arabs were highly skilled farmers. Our investigations revealed a very heterogeneous land use and soil development pattern, and no indicators for a sudden and general erosion event. In contrast, relic surfaces and the <b>soil's</b> <b>genesis</b> point to moister conditions in the past and differences in the soil's development point to diverse land use intensities.

In spite of this, Marbut's work reveals his personal understanding of the contributions of geology to soil science.

In humid regions, B horizons are the layers of maximum accumulation of materials such as silicate clays, iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) oxides, and organic material. These materials typically accumulate through a process termed illuviation, wherein the materials gradually wash in from the overlying horizons. Accordingly, this layer is also referred to as the [...] "illuviated" [...] horizon or the [...] "zone of accumulation". In addition, it is defined as having a distinctly different structure or consistency than the horizon(s) above and the horizon(s) below.

Both systems reflected the concepts and theories of <b>soil</b> <b>genesis</b> of the time, which were themselves predominantly qualitative in character. Modification of the 1938 system in 1949 corrected some of its deficiencies but also illustrated the need for a reappraisal of concepts and principles.

These aspects are of paramount importance to understand the dynamics of sustainability and preservation of this natural resource. In this study mangrove soils in the Subaé river basin were described and classified and inorganic waste concentrations evaluated. Seven pedons of mangrove soil were chosen, five under fluvial influence and two under marine influence and analyzed for morphology. Samples of horizons and layers were collected for physical and chemical analyses, including heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Mn, Zn, and Fe). The moist soils were suboxidic, with Eh values below 350 mV. The pH level of the pedons under fluvial influence ranged from moderately acid to alkaline, while the pH in pedons under marine influence was around 7. 0 throughout the profile. The concentration of cations in the sorting complex for all pedons, independent of fluvial or marine influence, indicated the following order: Na+>Mg 2 +>Ca 2 +>K+. Mangrove soils from the Subaé river basin under fluvial and marine influence had different morphological, physical, and chemical characteristics. The highest Pb and Cd concentrations {{were found in the}} pedons under fluvial influence, perhaps due to their closeness to the mining company Plumbum, while the concentrations in pedon P 7 were lowest, due to greater distance from the factory.

Limestone-derived soils in the southeast of Tocantins state, Brazil, are less notorious than similar soils in other regions of Brazil and their characterization could contribute to the Brazilian System for Soil Classification (SiBCS). Given that little is known of these soils, despitetheir agricultural potential, the objective of this study was to characterize their properties and the processes leading to <b>soil</b> of <b>genesis,</b> and also contribute to developing the Brazilian System of Soil Classification (SiBCS). Soils profiles were located on the summit (P 1), shoulder (P 2), backslope (P 3), and footslope (P 4) of a toposequence in the municipality of Lavandeira, Tocantins. Morphological, physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties of the profiles were determined. The soils were classified as: P 1 - Chernossolo Rêndzico Lítico típico (Lithic Haplustolls); P 2 - Cambissolo Háplico Ta Eutrófico léptico hipocarbonático (Lithic Haplustolls); P 3 - Cambissolo Háplico Carbonático léptico (Lithic Haplustepts); and P 4 - Luvissolo Háplico Órtico típico (Typic Rhodustalfs). All the profiles showed high contents of silt, calcium, and magnesium, which resulted in high pH and low exchangeable aluminum content. Base saturation and calcium carbonate equivalent contents were also high, and the horizons showed dark colors due to high organic matter content, which contained humin as the dominant fraction. Mineralogical analysis of the clay fraction indicated predominance of hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite, followed by illite, kaolinite, and quartz, whereas the sand fraction exhibited reflections characteristic of the quartz mineral.

Also, different pesticides can be ranked with respect to their ecological risk for a specific area under consideration. Such a 'regionalization' of the ecological risk can be approached as follows: (1) Small-scale scenarios being representative for the regions under consideration have to be selected and characterized. The characterization has to comprise: <b>soils</b> (types, <b>genesis,</b> thickness, permeability to subsoils), topology (e. g., slope), climatic conditions, surface water (occurrence of ditches, ponds and creeks), portion of the drained area, portion of land under agricultural use, typical cultures and types of pesticides, application rates and frequency. (2) The representativity of the selected scenarios for the region under consideration has to be determined. (3) For the various regions predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) are assessed for the different paths of entry (mainly spraydrift and runoff), the different ecological systems, the different durations of the impact (fate consideration). If appropriate, sensible average values (e. g., for an average distance of the aquatic system from the target area) have to be agreed upon.
