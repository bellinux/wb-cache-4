This property makes the multifractal traffic model a versatile tool in modeling traffic streams in computer communication networks. There, a node is loaded by a traffic flow resulting from the superposition of source streams and aggregated LRD (and other) streams. The structure and the burstiness of the superimposed process is studied, and useful mathematical relations are obtained. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{detecting}} the {{major changes in the}} stream of service requests is formulated. The change of <b>stream</b> <b>component</b> varies over time and depends on, e. g., a time of a day. The underlying cause of the change is called a context. Hence, at each mo-ment there exists a probability distribution determining the probability of requesting the system service conditioned by the context. The aim is to find such a moment in which the distributions change. To solve that problem dissimilarity measures between two probability distribu-tions are given. Nevertheless, detecting every change is not interesting but only long-lasting changes because of the costs of the service system resources reallocation. Therefore, in the proposed algorithm an issue of sensitivity to temporary changes detection is considered...|$|E

Process networks are concurrent processes communicating streams of data through FIFO channels. They can be executed e#ciently and determinately on multiprocessor platforms. However, such stream processing applications are becoming more dynamic, often requiring run-time reconfigurations. Moreover, stream processing is not always an application on its own, but may be a component of a larger application. This application, e. g. a game application, may be control oriented and event driven; events may interact with the <b>streaming</b> <b>component</b> and (re) configure it. In order to capture the interaction between reactive and <b>streaming</b> <b>components</b> as well as reconfiguration in dynamic stream processing, we introduce in this paper a formal, operational and compositional semantics of so-called reactive process networks.

At the molecular level, however, knowledge about mechanisms underlying alcoholism remains limited. In this study we examined the superior frontal cortex, one of the most vulnerable brain regions, of alcoholics and of age- and gender-matched control subjects by means of antibody microarrays and Western blot analyses, and identified an up-regulation of beta-catenin level in the superior frontal cortex of alcoholics. Beta-catenin is the orthologue of the Drosophila armadillo segment polarity gene and a down <b>stream</b> <b>component</b> of the Wnt and Akt signaling pathway. Beta-catenin was identified as a cell adhesion molecule of the cadherin family which binds to the actin cytoskeleton. Genetic and biochemical analyses also found that beta-catenin can be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor. In addition, electron microscopy performed on rat brain tissue sections has localized the beta-catenin and cadherin complexes to the synapses where they border the active zone. Because of the multi-functional role of beta-catenin in the nervous system, this study provides the premise for further investigation of mechanisms underlying the up-regulation of beta-catenin in alcoholism, which may have considerable pathogenic and therapeutic relevance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the first}} part of the paper a short review of the {{computer}} meteor stream searching techniques is given. Different fractions of the <b>stream</b> <b>component</b> obtained amongst radio, photographic and TV data are partially due to the use of different methods applied in the stream search. A new objective approach is proposed in order to obtain the threshold value Dc of the orbital similarity corresponding to the probability of chance occurrence of the stream. The 502 Canadian TV data has been used to test this approach. It appears, that the values of Dc given by Southworth & Hawkins (1963), and Lindblad (1971 b) formulae are too high to warrant sufficient reliability of the identified streams. Indeed using these formulae the result is that the probability to obtain by chance at least one stream of 4 - 5 members goes from 21 % to 68 %. The effect of the three different distance functions used to measure the orbital similarity (Southworth & Hawkins (1963), Drummond (1979, 1981), and Jopek 1993) has been investigated. For all functions taking the same 95 % reliability level, the number of streams detected is considerably less than in the case of the traditional approach (Jopek 1993 a). However, results are different using different distances. Finally, we give the list of the orbits of eight streams identified at the reliability level WM = 95 % using the Jopek distance. Key words: meteors – a stream searching algorithm which, together with the D-criterion and Dc, can be considered as a definition of a meteor stream. Three distance functions have been proposed (see Appendix for the mathematical formulation) : the Southworth & Hawkins (1963) distance DSH, its modification DD made by Drummond (1979, 1981) and an alternative hybrid DH given by Jopek (1993 b). Southworth & Hawkins (1963) proposed two definitions of a meteor stream given below. In both cases a meteor stream is defined as a significant concentration of orbits in orbital elements space...|$|E

40|$|Costa Rican {{tropical}} premontane rainforests {{are among}} the world's most valuable ecosystems in terms of diversity of animals, plants, and natural resources. These environments are dependent on water resources which fluctuate in quantity during the dry and wet seasons and which are significantly influenced by vegetation feedbacks. Currently, tropical premontane forest watersheds are insufficiently characterized in terms of groundwater and stream water interactions due to their limited accessibility and complex geological conditions. However, water produced from these watersheds is a critical renewable resource in Costa Rica. It {{plays a significant role}} in the production of downstream hydropower and acts as a supply for water distribution systems in many rural areas. In this study, stable isotope tracing of ?^(18) O and ?D was used to determine the source of water in a stream, and the relative contributions of water budget components (e. g., groundwater, soil water). Samples were collected beginning in the dry season and continuing through the wet season from 2013 - 2014 as the soil became progressively wetter. The ?^(18) O and ?D samples represent precipitation in the tropical forest, as well as groundwater, soil water, and stream water at several locations. This data is important to understanding the influence of vegetation and hydrogeological properties on groundwater and stream water in tropical headwater catchments. Streamflow averaged 0. 06 m^(3) /min in baseflow and greater than 0. 10 m^(3) /min during storms. Groundwater was seen to contribute to 80 % of streamflow and was the main <b>stream</b> <b>component</b> even during storm events. A small proportion of the total amount of streamflow came from interflow and soil water (1 %). Additional findings indicated that precipitation, about 4200 mm/yr, in the rainforest can be recycled source water. Storm tracks alternate from distribution starting in the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea over the course of the wet season. Overall precipitation was seen to be dominated by deep convection and enhanced during the wet season due to the North American Monsoon and the Intertropical Convergence Zone...|$|E

Several North American studies have acknowledged the effects of interactions between wood, sediment, and flow regimes (Bilby, 1981; Keller, E. A., and Swanson, F. J., 1979; Montgomery et al., 1995; Wohl, E., 2008), linking the triad to geomorphic changes, the redistribution of bed materials, and ecological benefits. A consensual baseline reference for LWD’s function over time does not exist however, partly due to previous research being primarily conducted in the Northeast and Pacific Northwest regions where historic actions of humans, particularly riparian logging and stream clearing, have greatly impacted {{the condition of the}} watersheds. Researchers having long-overlooked the Great Plains and other regions not commonly associated with woody vegetation has increased the ambiguity regarding the transferability of LWD findings between regions. By shifting the focus to a non-forested region, the goal of this thesis is to measure the dynamics and influence of a prairie stream’s wood load on sediment storage and bed morphology. The Kings Creek network study area is located on the Konza Prairie Biological Station in northeastern Kansas, and drains one of few remaining unaltered North American watersheds. Results document the ongoing forest expansion into the surrounding pristine grassland, and provide a temporal context of the regions changing climate representative of atypical stream conditions caused by drought. In total, 406 individual pieces of wood were measured. The wood load was lower than most forest streams referenced (13. 05 m[superscript]³/ 100 m), though higher than expected resulting from the absence of streamflow. LWD stored 108 m[superscript]³ of sediment within the channel, and the cumulative volume of LWD-formed pools was 169 m[superscript]³. Additionally, statistical analysis showed longitudinal bed variations to be strongly associated to LWD abundance, further indicating that LWD influences prairie stream processes similarly to those in a forest stream...|$|E

40|$|When {{handling}} large datasets {{that exceed}} {{the capacity of}} the main memory, movement of data between main memory and external memory (disk), rather than actual (CPU) computation time, is often the bottleneck in the computation. Since data is moved between disk and main memory in large contiguous blocks, this has {{led to the development of}} a large number of I/O-efficient algorithms that minimize the number of such block movements. TPIE is one of two major libraries that have been developed to support I/O-efficient algorithm implementations. TPIE provides an interface where list stream processing and sorting can be implemented in a simple and modular way without having to worry about memory management or block movement. However, if care is not taken, such streaming-based implementations can lead to practically inefficient algorithms since lists of data items are typically written to (and read from) disk between components. In this paper we present a major extension of the TPIE library that includes a pipelining framework that allows for practically efficient streaming-based implementations while minimizing I/O-overhead between <b>streaming</b> <b>components.</b> The framework pipelines <b>streaming</b> <b>components</b> to avoid I/Os between components, that is, it processes several components simultaneously while passing output from one component directly to the input of the next component in main memory.
