5|$|The Arizona senator {{subsequently}} {{resumed his}} familiar {{position as a}} political underdog, riding the Straight Talk Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events. By December 2007, the Republican race was unsettled, {{with none of the}} top-tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the Republican base electorate. McCain was showing a resurgence, in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire– the scene of his 2000 triumph– and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe, the New Hampshire Union Leader, and almost two dozen other state newspapers, as well as from <b>Senator</b> <b>Lieberman</b> (now an Independent Democrat). McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3, 2008, Iowa caucuses, which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, as Chairman of {{what was}} then known as the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, <b>Senator</b> <b>Lieberman</b> led the fight {{to create a new}} Department of Homeland Security. One month after the {{terrorist}} attacks on September 11, 2001, he introduced legislation to reorganize the federal government to better protect the American people from terrorism and natural disasters and steered a bipartisan plan through his committee. After months of opposing the plan, the White House eventually endorsed the concept. Legislation that passed Congress in 2002 created a department incorporating key organizational elements <b>Senator</b> <b>Lieberman</b> advocated.|$|E

[...] House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi added, [...] "I completely disagree with Lieberman. I believe that {{we have a responsibility to}} speak out if we think that the course of action that our country is not making the American people safer, making our military stronger and making the region more stable."

2500|$|Early polling showed Lieberman {{with as much}} as a 46-point lead, but {{subsequent}} {{polls showed}} Lamont gaining until Lamont took the lead just weeks before the primary. A controversy about a [...] "kiss" [...] Lieberman supposedly received from President Bush during the 2005 State of the Union address highlighted concerns that the senator was too close to the unpopular president to be a credible Democratic nominee. Lieberman released several campaign advertisements over the summer of 2006, seeking to connect himself to former President Bill Clinton and to portray Lamont as standing for little more than opposition to Lieberman. Lamont struck back against some of Lieberman's more negative ads with an advertisement produced by well-known political consultant Bill Hillsman. In Lamont's ad, a foreboding narrator says, [...] "Meet Ned Lamont. He can't make a decent cup of coffee, he's a bad karaoke singer, and he has a messy desk." [...] Lamont then chimes in, [...] "Aren't you sick of political attack ads that insult your intelligence? <b>Senator</b> <b>Lieberman,</b> let's stick to issues and pledge to support whoever wins the Democratic primary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ned Lamont (D): On August 8, Greenwich {{businessman}} Ned Lamont received 52% of {{the vote}} in the statewide Democratic Primary for one of Connecticut's seats in the United States Senate. He defeated incumbent Senator Joe Lieberman, who ran in the November election as a petitioning candidate of the Connecticut for Lieberman party line. [...] In order to get onto the primary ballot on May 19, 2006, Lamont received 33% {{of the vote}} at the Democratic State Convention, well above the 15% threshold needed to appear on the primary ballot without having to collect signatures. Sean Smith, who at the time was the campaign manager for <b>Senator</b> <b>Lieberman,</b> dismissed his performance, claiming that many delegates at the convention saw the endorsement question as a [...] "free vote" [...] to [...] "register displeasure with Lieberman without it costing them anything," [...] and speculated that those voters would return to Lieberman in the August primary. Lieberman dismissed Smith as his campaign manager the morning after Lieberman's primary defeat on August 8. [...] Lamont differed from Lieberman on various issues. He opposed the Iraq War and the USA Patriot Act, opposed the creditor-friendly changes to U.S. bankruptcy law, opposed federal intervention in cases such as the Terri Schiavo case, opposed the federal earmark system, and said he would have led the charge against the Samuel Alito nomination. (Although Lieberman was one of 41 Democrats who voted against the Alito confirmation, he was one of 18 Democrats to vote for cloture. If cloture did not pass, a vote on the confirmation would have been blocked (unless Republicans had taken the controversial step of invoking the so-called [...] "nuclear option").|$|E
