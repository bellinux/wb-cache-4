Abstract. Nowadays contingency analysis {{being a part}} of a power system <b>security</b> <b>calculations</b> is a mandatory procedure for a short-term operational stage of the electrical power system (EPS). Nevertheless, {{there are still a lot}} of problems, concerning <b>security</b> <b>calculations.</b> For instance, recent studies have shown necessity to consider simultaneous failures of several power system elements during contingency analysis. This brings complexity and voluminosity of <b>security</b> <b>calculations</b> to the new level. On the one hand, analysis of all possible contingency combinations results in unreasonably high computing time. On the other hand, many contingency combinations, especially with verylarge number of simultaneously failed elements (SFE), have little impact on overall result of security estimation due to very low probability of such combinations. This paper presents novel mathematical algorithm allowing estimation of significant number of simultaneously failed elements (SNSFE). Proposed algorithm was tested on the 14 -bus IEEE reliability test system. Results show adequate accuracy of the technique and also confirm the necessity to simulate simultaneous failures of several network elements...|$|E

Evidence from the 1978 - 79 Uganda-Tanzania war, and the post- 1994 DRC-Rwanda conflict, indicates that given these conditions forced migration strains interstate security relations by arousing suspicion and fear of migrants living in neighbouring States among leaders of refugees’ home country; and provoking migrants’ desire to forcefully return home expressed through politico-military mobilisation and declaration of war. Sending States pressure host States to ‘contain’ refugees’ mobilisation for forceful return. When recipient States are {{unable or unwilling to}} satisfy sending States’ demands, refugees become infused in both countries’ <b>security</b> <b>calculations.</b> These convergent processes generate interstate conflicts and may result in armed confrontation.

It is just such a formulation of a calculus or grammar – ‘decision trees’, ‘event trees’, ‘attribute-based algorithms’ – that characterizes contemporary security. As for Turing, the logic comprises ‘two faculties, which we may call intuition and ingenuity’. The intuitive realm of imagination and speculation reaches toward a possible solution, while the ingenuity seeks arrangements of propositions. The advent of ‘rules-based’ and ‘risk-based’ security decisions, then, are always already political because they precisely involve combinatorial possibilities whose arrangement has effects in the world...|$|E

The "relative dominance of the environment " and "decision making imagery " are suggested as two principal organizing dimensions. A brief survey of the literature demonstrates some of the principal themes that are apparent using this framework. Drawn from one of the many approaches, the Competing Aspiration Levels Model(CALM) is described and then applied to the recent budgetary history of twelve developed market systems. The results of the empirical analysis suggest that some features of the budgetary process in the U. S. make it quite distinctive relative to other industrialized democracies. In particular, it is shown that U. S. fiscal authorities are relatively less committed to balancing revenues and expenditures and that the military sector is more sensitive to international <b>security</b> <b>calculations</b> in the formulation of budgetary targets. Comparison of the results for the twelve countries studied also suggest little support for the hypothesis that wealth/predictability in the budgetary environment leads to greater use of incrementalist strategies. The results of the comparative analysis, however, do support the contention that the defense and civilian sectors are enmeshed in a competitive situation implying trade-offs between the two in spending levels.

Since China launched its open-door policy in 1979, the way the Chinese think and assess the field has significantly changed. Today, the once widely supported realist approach is being rejected by a growing body of Chinese experts who now view the world as increasingly interdependent in both economic and security terms. This paper shows how the Chinese perspective on security issues has diversified and significantly transformed into a more interdependent viewpoint. Despite general skepticism over whether China has learned the inevitability of state sovereignty infringement in the globalization age, Chinese analysts came to understand and believe in the necessity of the security regime and multilateralism in the post-Cold War period. The “new security concept” exemplified the development of the mutual security in the late 1990 s.

40|$|Abstract: By {{providing}} ubiquitous Internet connectivity, wireless networks {{offer more}} convenient ways for users to surf the Internet. However, wireless networks encounter more technological challenges than wired networks, such as bandwidth, security problems, and handoff latency. Thus, this paper proposes {{new technologies to}} solve these problems. First, a Security Access Gateway (SAG) is proposed to solve the security issue. Originally, mobile terminals were unable to process high <b>security</b> <b>calculations</b> because of their low calculating power. SAG not only offers high calculating power to encrypt the encryption demand of SAG’s domain, but also helps mobile terminals to establish a multiple safety tunnel to maintain a secure domain. Second, Robust Header Compression (RoHC) technology is adopted to increase the utilization of bandwidth. Instead of Access Point (AP), Access Gateway (AG) is used {{to deal with the}} packet header compression and de-compression from the wireless end. AG’s high calculating power is able to reduce the load on AP. In the original architecture, AP has to deal with a large number of demands by header compression/de-compression from mobile terminals. Eventually, wireless networks must offer users “Mobility ” and “Roaming”. For wireless networks to achieve “Mobility ” and “Roaming, ” we can use Mobile IPv 6 (MIPv 6) technology. Nevertheless, such technology might cause latency. Furthermore, how the security tunnel and header compression established before the handoff can be used by mobile terminals handoff will be another great challenge. Thus, this paper proposes to solve the problem by using Early Binding Updates (EBU) and Security Access Gateway (SAG) to offer a complete mechanism with low latency, low handoff mechanism calculation, and high security...|$|E
40|$|Seng Tan From any vantage point, {{the shift}} in {{relations}} between China and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) {{in the past four}} decades has been nothing less than remarkable. Branded by Beijing at its inception in 1967 as an anti-China and anti-communist regional grouping, ASEAN, in 2007, was openly acknowledging ‘the important role that China has been playing in regional and global affairs ’ and the ‘significant ’ contributions that close China–ASEAN relations had brought ‘to peace, stability and prosperity in the region and the world at large ’ (ASEAN 2007). At the risk of oversimplification, contemporary theoretical assessments of the evolution of China–ASEAN relations largely coalesce around two main propositions. On one hand, social constructivists argue that normative suasion and change as well as regional identity formation have taken place as a result of efforts by both parties at complex engagement with one another (Acharya 1996; Ba 2006; Johnston and Evans 1999). By and large, these efforts in part attribute the stabilisation and enhancement of China–ASEAN ties to the shared reliance on the non-contractual, non-confrontational, consensus-seeking and process-oriented diplomatic convention advanced by ASEAN—namely, the so-called ‘ASEAN way’. They highlight China’s transition from its initial mistrust of regional arrangements, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, as nefarious strategies aimed at encircling China, to its keen embrace of such and of multilateral diplomacy at large (Johnston 2003; Kuik 2005). For social constructivists, the ASEAN way constitutes a ‘counter-Realpolitik ’ philosophy of regional security, which promotes reassuring behaviour over traditional Realpolitik approaches that emphasise competition and coercion (Acharya 1997; Johnston 2003 : 123). 1 On the other hand, realists and English School pluralists are considerably less sanguine about prospects for regional peace.

40|$|Although {{mathematical}} cryptography {{has been widely}} used, its security has only been proven under certain assumptions such as the computational power of opponents. As an alternative, quantum communication, in particular quantum key distribution (QKD) can get around unproven assumptions and achieve unconditional security. However, the key generation rate of practical QKD systems is limited by device imperfections, excess noise from the quantum channel, limited rate of true random-number generation, quantum entanglement preparation, and/or post-processing efficiency. This dissertation contributes to improving the performance of quantum communication systems. First, it proposes a new continuous-variable QKD (CVQKD) protocol that loosens the efficiency requirement on post-processing, a bottleneck for long-distance CVQKD systems. It also demonstrates an experimental implementation of the proposed protocol. To achieve high rates, the CVQKD experiment uses a continuous-wave local oscillator (CWLO). The excess noise caused by guided acoustic-wave Brillioun scattering (GAWBS) is avoided by a frequency-shift scheme, resulting in a 32 dB noise reduction. The statistical distribution of the GAWBS noise is characterized by quantum tomography. Measurements show Gaussian statistics upto 55 dB of dynamical range, which validates the <b>security</b> <b>calculations</b> in the proposed CVQKD protocol. True random numbers are required in quantum and classical cryptography. A second contribution of this thesis is that it experimentally demonstrates an ultrafast quantum random-number generator (QRNG) based on amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Random numbers are produced by a multi-mode photon counting measurement on ASE light. The performance of the QRNG is analyzed with quantum information theory and verified with NIST standard random-number test. The QRNG experiment demonstrates a random-number generation rate at 20 Gbits/s. Theoretical studies show fundamental limits for such QRNGs. Quantum entanglement produced in nonlinear optical processes can help to increase quantum communication distance. A third contribution is the research on nonlinear optics of graphene, a novel 2 D material with unconventional physical properties. Based on a quantum-dynamical model, optical responses of graphene are derived, showing {{for the first time}} a link between the complex linear optical conductivity and the quantum decoherence. Nonlinear optical responses, in particular four-wave mixing, is studied for the first time. The theory predicts saturation effects in graphene and relates the saturation threshold to the ultrafast quantum decoherence and carrier relaxation in graphene. For the experimental part, four-wave mixing in graphene is demonstrated. Twin-photon production in graphene is under investigation.

40|$|Excerpt] U. S. -China {{relations}} were remarkably smooth {{for much of}} the George W. Bush Administration, although there are signs that U. S. China policy now is subject to competing reassessments. State Department officials in 2005 unveiled what they said was a new framework for the relationship — with the United States willing to work cooperatively with China while encouraging Beijing to become a “responsible stakeholder” in the global system. U. S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in December 2006 established a U. S. -China Strategic Economic Dialogue with Beijing, the most senior regular dialogue yet held with China. But other U. S. policymakers have adopted tougher stances on issues involving China and U. S. -China relations. They are concerned {{about the impact of the}} PRC’s strong economic growth and a more assertive PRC diplomacy in the international arena; about procedures to assure the quality of Chinese pharmaceuticals, food, and other products being imported into the United States; and about trade practices and policies in China that contribute to a strong U. S. -China trade imbalance in the latter’s favor. Taiwan, which China considers a “renegade province,” remains the most sensitive issue the two countries face and the one many observers fear could lead to Sino-U. S. conflict. But U. S. relations with Taiwan have also been plagued by what some U. S. officials see as that government’s minimal defense spending and the recurrent independence-leaning actions and rhetoric of its President and other government officials, which U. S. officials have called “unhelpful” to regional stability. On March 11, 2008, the anniversary of a large-scale anti-Chinese uprising in 1959, the political status of Tibet re-emerged as an issue when monks in Lhasa launched a protest against PRC rule. The protests, at times apparently resulting in violent clashes with police, judging from news reports, have spread to several other cities in Tibet and beyond. Beijing’s response has led some Tibetan activists to add their voices to other calls urging a boycott of the Summer Olympics in Beijing in August 2008. Other concerns about China appear driven by <b>security</b> <b>calculations</b> in Congress and at the Pentagon, where officials question the motivations behind China’s expanding military budget. One congressionally mandated DOD report concluded Beijing is greatly understating its military expenditures and is developing anti-satellite (ASAT) systems — a claim that gained more credence when the PRC used a ballistic missile to destroy one of its own orbiting satellites in January 2007. Bilateral economic and trade issues also are growing matters of concern. U. S. officials and lawmakers particularly criticize China’s massive bilateral trade surplus, its failure to halt piracy of U. S. intellectual property rights (IPR), and its continued constraints on currency valuation.

Although the overall impact of China and India's engagement in Africa has been positive in the short-term, {{partly as a result of}} higher returns from commodity exports fuelled by excessive demands from both countries, little research exists on the actual impact of China and India's growing involvement on Africa's economic transformation. This book examines in detail the opportunities and challenges posed by the increasing presence of China and India in Africa, and proposes critical interventions that African governments must undertake in order to negotiate with China and India from a stronger and more informed platform.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} of the paper is to identify the structural factors {{that led to a}} chronic insufficiency of the Romanian agri-food domestic supply in the last decades. The paper makes an update and re-evaluation of problems related to Romania's agriculture production potential, {{in the context of the}} current evolutions of the agrarian and production structures and of the possible effects of the Common Agricultural Policy Reform. The changes produced in the last decade are investigated with regard to farm consolidation, increase of farm area, agricultural land operation modality and land market problems. At the same time, the production structures are also analyzed in relation to farm size. The main conclusion of the study is that the current agrarian structures contribute by different modalities to ensuring the domestic agricultural supply and food <b>security.</b> The <b>calculation</b> of certain statistical indicators on production variability and its diversification on the large, medium and small-sized farms revealed the strong specialization of production on the large farms and production diversification on the small farms...|$|R
40|$|While cloud {{computing}} infrastructures proliferates in nowadays computing and communications technology {{there are few}} reports investigating models for their security. In this paper, new efficient models are developed and evaluated for analyzing the security-related behavior of {{cloud computing}} architectures and networks comprising complex interconnected communication systems adapted towards a generalized analysis. These cloud related models, based on Markov processes, allow <b>calculation</b> of critical <b>security</b> factors for the cloud infrastructure, related to intrusion detection, of such interconnected and distributed systems components and {{the evaluation of the}} associated security mechanisms. Although, at this step an architecture of at least three interconnected systems is analyzed, the systematic model introduced allows for a generalized model of N interconnected systems in a cloud architecture under reasonable assumptions. We herein show the principles of such an analysis. <b>Security</b> parameters <b>calculation</b> and <b>Security</b> mechanisms evaluation may support the risk analysis and the decision making process in resolving the trade-offs between security and quality of service characteristics corresponding to the complex interconnected computing and communication systems...|$|R
