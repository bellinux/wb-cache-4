40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the study}} of lung and heart {{diagnosis}} application is investigated based on frequency separation of breath <b>sound</b> <b>frequency.</b> The aim of study is to investigate how to separate and process the breath <b>sound</b> <b>frequency</b> into lung <b>sound</b> <b>frequency</b> and heart <b>sound</b> <b>frequency.</b> Since the lung and the heart are the vital organ of human, therefore the needs of immediate preventive and curative actions are primarily important. Here, the frequency separation of breath sound is carried out by using the modulation filtering method.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of the nonlinear {{effects of the}} gas motion {{as well as of}} the acoustic lining material on the transmission and attenuation of sound in a circular duct with a uniform cross-section and no mean flow. The acoustic material is characterized by an empirical, nonlinear impedance in which the instantaneous resistance is a nonlinear function of both the frequency and the acoustic velocity. The results show that there exist frequency bandwidths around the resonant frequencies in which the nonlinearity decreases the attenuation rate, and outside which the nonlinearity increases the attenuation rate, in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, the effect of the gas nonlinearity increases with increasing <b>sound</b> <b>frequency,</b> whereas the effect of the material nonlinearity decreases with increasing <b>sound</b> <b>frequency...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Sound</b> <b>frequency</b> {{patterns}} and <b>sound</b> pressure levels of distress calls from pups of several litters of albino mice were analysed. Practically all the characteristics measured (length of the calls, initial, terminal, minimum and maximum <b>sound</b> <b>frequency,</b> total bandwidth and sound pressure) changed with successive days of age. However, only {{the length of}} the calls, their bandwidth and their sound pressure developed in a regular way and all decreased as the pups grew older. The other measures fluctuated considerably but did not show any definite trend. It is suggested that reduction in the acoustic energy of the calls (intensity × duration) could decrease their effectiveness in eliciting maternal responses and could be the result of reduced cold stress as the pups develop homoiothermy. © 1969.
