40|$|AbstractBrazilian wine {{production}} {{is dominated by}} the use of American grape cultivars (Vitis labrusca L.) and their hybrids. In this context, this study analyzed the phenolic composition and sensory profile of Bordô and BRS Carmem red wines elaborated from traditional and two alternative winemaking technologies: grape pre-drying and <b>submerged</b> <b>cap</b> of chaptalized musts. Anthocyanins and pyranoanthocyanins apparently seemed to be affected by the thermal process (60 °C), causing their degradation. In addition, the decrease of the concentration of these compounds could be suggested as a result of possible oxidation and hydrolysis reactions of anthocyanin 3 -glucosides. Stilbenes were also affected by thermal degradation; however, flavan- 3 -ols and HCAD seemed to be less affected by the drying process. <b>Submerged</b> <b>cap</b> winemaking resulted in an increase of the anthocyanin and pyranoanthocyanin compounds due to the constant contact between the must and pomace during the alcoholic fermentation. The antioxidant capacity seemed not to be affected by thermal degradation, since the products of Maillard reaction also present antioxidant properties. Pre-dried wines were described as structured due to their higher flavan- 3 -ols content, and with high color intensity probably due to the formation of Maillard reaction products. The <b>submerged</b> <b>cap</b> wines presented an intense violet hue due to their high anthocyanin derivative concentrations and showed strong correlation with all other classes of the phenolic compounds...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{contrast}} to the most worldwide used grape varieties, wine production in Brazil is mainly devoted to the elaboration of table wines from American grapes and hybrids. These grapes show initial disadvantages such as low soluble solids content in their optimal stage of ripening and poor color quality. Based on this, the Brazilian Agency EMBRAPA Grape and Wine has developed BRS type cultivars {{in order to enhance}} the quality of the table wines. This study analyzed the phenolic composition and sensory profile of BRS Rúbea and BRS Cora red wines elaborated by traditional and two alternative winemaking technologies: grape pre-drying and <b>submerged</b> <b>cap</b> of chaptalized musts. Pre-dried wines presented low concentrations of anthocyanins/pyranoanthocyanins and flavonols, suggesting that they were partially degraded by the thermal treatment (60 °C). These wines were described as bitter and full-bodied because of their higher flavan- 3 -ols content, suggesting that these compounds were not greatly influenced by thermal degradation. <b>Submerged</b> <b>cap</b> was described as persistent to the palate and with an intense violet hue due to its high anthocyanin and flavonol concentrations. The antioxidant capacity presented a weak relationship with the anthocyanins and stilbenes, but was intensely related to the % of galloylated flavan- 3 -ols...|$|E

30|$|In {{high density}} {{polyethylene}} bottles, 1  L drinking water samples were collected from Shang valley of Besham in District Shangla. A convenient sampling plan was applied for collecting the samples from wells where as rapidly flowing shallow streams and rivers, and shallow (<  5  m) lakes are usually well mixed depth. Grab samples were conveniently collected by <b>submerging</b> a <b>capped</b> polyethylene bottles below the surface and removing the cap. After the sample bottle was filled, the cap was replaced and the bottle removed. 0.45  µm polycarbonate membrane Nucleopore filters (Millipore) was used to filter the water samples and then pH 2.5 was retained.|$|R
50|$|The {{vineyards}} {{feature the}} gravelly soils that characterise the better vineyards {{of the left}} bank of the Gironde, although there are also areas of sand and clay. There are approximately 30 hectares to the estate, with vines aged over 25 years on average, these being 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, the remainder mostly Merlot at 39% and a mere 1% accounted for by Cabernet Franc. The fruit is hand-harvested before going to a sorting table positioned in the vineyard, from where it travels to the reception area where the grapes are destemmed, lightly crushed and then fermented according to the plot of origin. During the fermentation the must is pumped over to <b>submerge</b> the <b>cap,</b> and the temperature regulated to around 30ºC, with subsequent maceration of the solids at about two degrees below this figure. Following this the wine is run off into fresh vats for malolactic, tasting and assigning the wines to either the grand vin, Château Desmirail, or the second wine which {{goes by the name}} of Château Fontarney for the French market and Initial de Desmirail for export and for the French restaurant trade. The grand vin goes into oak for 12-18 months, with one-third of the barrels new each year; racking is performed every three months, and the fining is achieved with egg whites prior to bottling.|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic global ocean {{warming is}} {{predicted}} to cause bleaching of many near-sea-surface (NSS) coral reefs, placing increased importance on deeper reef habitats to maintain coral reef biodiversity and ecosystem function. However, the location and spatial extent of many deep reef habitats is poorly known. The question arises: how common are deep reef habitats in comparison with NSS reefs? We used a dataset from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to show that only about 39 % of available seabed on <b>submerged</b> banks is <b>capped</b> by NSS coral reefs (16 110 km²); the other 61 % of bank area (25 600 km²) is submerged at a mean depth of around 27 m and represents potential deep reef habitat that is spatially distributed along the GBR continental shelf in the same latitudinal distribution as NSS reefs. Out of 25 600 km² of submerged bank area, predictive habitat modelling indicates {{that more than half}} (around 14 000 km²) is suitable habitat for coral communities...|$|R
