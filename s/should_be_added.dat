5|$|Aspect weavers take {{instructions}} {{known as}} advice specified {{through the use}} of pointcuts and join points, special segments of code that indicate what methods should be handled by aspect code. The implementation of the aspect then specifies whether the related code <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> before, after, or throughout the related methods. By doing this, aspect weavers improve modularity, keeping code in one place that would otherwise have been interspersed throughout various, unrelated classes.|$|E
5|$|The {{obedience}} of Anacletus II may be reconstructed basing on {{the letter}} addressed to king Lothair III of Germany by his cardinals {{soon after his}} coronation.

Pulsed current is particularly useful for these applications, as it helps limit the heat input.

5|$|Topological sorting is the {{algorithmic}} {{problem of}} finding a topological ordering of a given DAG. It can be solved in linear time. Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting builds the vertex ordering directly. It maintains a list of vertices that have no incoming edges from other vertices that have not already {{been included in the}} partially constructed topological ordering; initially this list consists of the vertices with no incoming edges at all. Then, it repeatedly adds one vertex from this list {{to the end of the}} partially constructed topological ordering, and checks whether its neighbors <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to the list. The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been processed in this way. Alternatively, a topological ordering may be constructed by reversing a postorder numbering of a depth-first search graph traversal.|$|E
5|$|To {{ameliorate}} {{the situation}} the old Republic maintained {{a policy of}} severe austerity during the century, especially economizing on its defense outlays (which in large part explains why its military and political role declined so much). Up to the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War this policy succeeded in bringing down the level of debt, but this war brought a large uptick in the public debt: between 1780 and 1794 the province of Holland alone issued 120 million guilders of new bonds. In 1795, its total debt stood at 455 million guilders. To this <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> the debts of the United East India Company and its sister, the WIC, and the five Dutch Admiralties {{for a total of}} about 150 million guilders. The other provinces owed 155 million guilders. The grand total in 1795, {{at the beginning of the}} Batavian Republic, came to 760 million guilders; this imposed a debt service of 25 million guilders annually. The indemnity of the Treaty of The Hague immediately added 100 million guilders to this total, and the maintenance of the French army of occupation added about 12 million annually (while the other funding requirements of the republic added another 20 million annually). In 1814 the public debt stood at 1.7 billion guilders.|$|E

5|$|In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records {{commissioned}} {{the release of}} You Can Dance—Madonna's first retrospective—which was aimed at the dance segment of her audience. It was an album containing seven of Madonna's songs in remixed format, which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s. By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular {{and the concept of}} remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Mixing was an interpretative process, where the artist was usually involved, but the development was generally looked after the record producer. The different parts of a song, including the lead vocals, background vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machine—all went through the process of mixing to sound considerably different from their original counterpart. Mixing determined how loud these instruments were going to sound in relation to each other and what particular sound effects <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to each instrument. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way, after it has been recorded. The arrangements were itself created at the mixing stage, rather than being created previously. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass.|$|E
