500|$|If it {{were not}} for Shen Kuo's {{analysis}} and quoting in his Dream Pool Essays of the writings of the architect Yu Hao (fl. 970), the latter's work would have been lost to history. Yu designed a famous wooden pagoda that burned down in 1044 and was replaced in 1049 by a brick pagoda (the 'Iron Pagoda') of similar height, but not of his design. From Shen's quotation—or perhaps Shen's own paraphrasing of Yu Hao's Timberwork Manual (木經; Mujing)—shows that already in the 10th century there was a graded system of building unit proportions, a system which Shen states had become more precise in his time but stating no one could possibly reproduce such a sound work. However, he did not anticipate the more complex and matured system of unit proportions embodied in the extensive written work by scholar-official Li Jie (1065–1110), the Treatise on Architectural Methods (營造法式; Yingzao Fashi) of 1103. Klaas Ruitenbeek states that the version of the Timberwork Manual quoted by Shen is most likely Shen's <b>summarization</b> of Yu's work or a corrupted passage of the original by Yu Hao, as Shen writes: [...] "According to some, the work was written by Yu Hao." ...|$|E

500|$|Carme Juncadella {{produced}} a systematic review of research as of 2013 {{related to the}} impact of NVC on the development of empathy. She found 13 studies which met her inclusion criteria (three were published in peer reviewed journals; ten were unpublished theses or researcher reports). Eleven of these suggested an increase in empathy subsequent to the application of NVC (five of these with evidence of statistical significance) and two did not. Juncadella notes several shortcomings of her review. None of the studies she included were randomized and only three used validated instruments. As a result she used a narrative synthesis review format, which, [...] "lacks precision," [...] but allows the <b>summarization</b> of studies of different types, sizes, outcome measures and aims. She suggests the primary limitation of her review is that a number of relevant studies exist that could not be included due to lack of availability. She suggests these might have significantly altered her results. Finally, she includes the following caveat: [...] "I must mention the inevitable subjectivity bias present throughout the whole review. In spite of the efforts made towards 'disciplined subjectivity'... my decisions show a degree of uncertainty and inaccuracy born via the tension between the weak evidence of the studies and my own convictions about the NVC model." [...] Her overall assessment of the current research on NVC's efficacy in promoting the development of empathy is that the results are promising, but [...] "would need to be confirmed with further studies bearing stronger designs and more appropriate measures." [...] She notes that a major shortcoming of the existing research is the [...] "mismatch between the constructs of the model and the validated empathy measures" [...] and suggests that improved instruments need to be developed to adequately test NVC.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} technique for structured sequential programs based upon abstract reasoning over symbolic traces. The novelty {{is that the}} technique performs abstraction on demand, as opposed to systematically, {{in the pursuit of}} a safety proof. The idea is to maintain precision to enhance the likelihood of proof, performing abstraction only when efficiency is at stake. The technique is automatic in the sense that no user input is required. The main technical result is analysis of bounded programs, those whose symbolic traces are bounded in length, where the analysis is exact. For example, loop-free programs fall into this class. While the problem is exponential-time in general, we introduce a notion of dynamic <b>summarizations</b> which can enable substantial pruning of the search space of traces. <b>Summarizations</b> also allow our analysis to be compositional, key to extending the boundedprogram analysis technique to the general case. Finally, the technique is tunable, primarily for two reasons. First, the technique is compositional. Second, the technique at its core is a function which generalizes a set of constraints, and custom functions may be directly used. 1...|$|R

40|$|Packet {{sampling}} {{methods such as}} Cisco’s NetFlow are widely employed by large networks {{to reduce the amount}} of traffic data measured. A key problem with packet sampling is that it is inherently a lossy process, discarding (potentially useful) information. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the impact of sampling on anomaly detection metrics. Starting with unsampled flow records collected during the Blaster worm outbreak, we reconstruct the underlying packet trace and simulate packet sampling at increasing rates. We then use our knowledge of the Blaster anomaly to build a baseline of normal traffic (without Blaster), against which we can measure the anomaly size at various sampling rates. This approach allows us to evaluate the impact of packet sampling on anomaly detection without being restricted to (or biased by) a particular anomaly detection method. We find that packet sampling does not disturb the anomaly size when measured in volume metrics such as the number of bytes and number of packets, but grossly biases the number of flows. However, we find that recently proposed entropy-based <b>summarizations</b> of packet and flow counts are affected less by sampling, and expose the Blaster worm outbreak even at higher sampling rates. Our findings suggest that entropy <b>summarizations</b> are more resilient to sampling than volume metrics. Thus, while not perfect, sampling still preserves sufficient distributional structure, which when harnessed by tools like entropy, can expose hard-to-detect scanning anomalies...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{estimating}} the Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) for bounded programs, formalized as discovering a tight upper bound of a resource variable. One main obstacle is the role of complicated loops, where each iteration exhibits different behavior. Here traditional methods such as abstract interpretation often are too inaccurate. Our basic approach addresses complicated loops by simply unrolling them. The challenge therefore is how to make this scalable while preserving accuracy. In this paper, we present a fully automated algorithm which performs symbolic simulation of the program, unrolling its loops. It maintains accuracy because it preserves, at critical points, pathsensitivity. In other words, the simulation detects infeasible paths. Scalability, on the other hand, is dealt wih by using <b>summarizations,</b> a compact representation of the analysis of loop iteration. This is obtained by a judicious use of abstraction which preserves critical information needed to flow from one iteration to another. More importantly, these <b>summarizations</b> can be compounded {{in such a way as}} to produce superlinear behavior: that is, the length of the symbolic execution can in fact be shorter than a concrete execution. This is important because the cost of symbolic simulation is, clearly, far more than concrete simulation. Finally, we present a comprehensive experimental evaluation using a standard benchmark suite. We show that our algorithm is fast, and importantly, we often obtain not just accurate but exact results. 1...|$|R
