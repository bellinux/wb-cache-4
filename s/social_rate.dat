For example, Fogel estimated the private {{rate of return on}} the Union Pacific Railroad at 11.6%, whereas the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> that accounts for social benefits, such as improved firm efficiencies and government subsidies, was estimated at 29.9%. [...] In another study, Heckelman and Wallis estimated that the first 500 miles of railroad in a given state led to major increases in property values between 1850 and 1910. They calculated the revenue gain from the land appreciation to be $33,000-$200,000 per mile, while construction costs were $20,000-$40,000 per mile. Hence, on average the revenue from construction of a new railroad outweighed the costs. While initial construction returns were high, the profitability diminished after the first 500 miles.|$|E

40|$|The present paper compares {{estimates}} of the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return to education for Indigenous Australians with those for non-Indigenous Australians. The <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return measures the net benefits to society of educating its citizens. If education is treated as an investment by society in its people, then Australian society will be made better off {{by an increase in}} educational investment as long as the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return is higher than that for other public investments. This paper provides a discussion of the concept of the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return to education and some estimates for Indigenous Australians. Higher levels of education, in general, lead to an increased probability of finding employment and higher levels of income in employment. Hence, an increased level of education for an Indigenous person would be of advantage in economic terms; the private rate of return to education is likely to be quite high. In addition, we argue that increasing education has important social benefits (so-called 'externalities') for Indigenous people, and society in general: improved education would lead to better nutrition, to better living conditions, to better access to health services, and hence to a longer and healthier life. This means that productivity would be higher for Indigenous people and they would have higher incomes {{over a longer period of}} time. In addition, we argue that improved levels of education have the capacity to contribute to a decrease in the numbers of Indigenous people who are imprisoned, and thus lead to a direct reduction in the costs of imprisonment. Thus, increased education increases the earnings span, decreases prison costs and hence increases the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return. We find that the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return for education is generally higher for Indigenous Australians than for non-Indigenous Australians. This suggests, from a public policy perspective, that government should allocate increased funding for the education of Indigenous people since this <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of return is greater than the Department of Finance recommended cut-off rates for government investment projects. ...|$|E

The main {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the private and social returns of education at the secondary and higher education levels between 2010 and 2014, giving also an outlook based on gender and country. This study is a document research. The data have been taken from the OECD Education at a Glance issued between 2010 and 2014. It is observed that private rates of return at higher education level are higher than the secondary education level except for the male context in 2014.

40|$|Most {{discussions on}} the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of {{discount}} have assumed that the economy under consideration is isolated {{from the rest of}} the world, and that there are no capital movements. This paper explicitly analyzes the determination of the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of discount in a small open developing economy. It is shown that under general conditions, the discount rate will bea weighted average of the marginal return to capital in the private sector(p), the rate of time preference (r), and the marginal cost of foreign indebtedness (n). It is also shown that unless the country faces an upward-sloping supply curve for foreign funds the weights of p and r will be zero. Finally, it is shown that if the country in question faces a foreign borrowing constraint imposed from abroad, the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of discount becomes equal to a weighted average of the domestic marginal return to capital and the rate of time preferences. Data for a group of LDCs is then used to show that financial markets have indeed attached a default country risk premium to LDCs. This provides some evidence in favor of the hypothesis that developing countries face an upward-sloping supply curve of foreign funds, and that, in general, the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of discount should be a weighted average of p, r and n. Finally,some numerical examples are used to show that ignoring the open economy aspects can result in a substantial overstatement of the <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> of discount. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{risk-adjusted}} <b>social</b> <b>rate</b> {{of return}} remains substantially lower for housing than for {{other types of}} investment. Savvy investors allocate their resources across different types of investment to maximize their returns; savvy societies do likewise. Just as with the private sector, society’s returns are maximized when risk-adjusted social rates of return equalize across all types of investment (Auerbach 1983; Hendershott 1987). After all, if these rates of return are not equal, society could increase its income by shifting resources from low-return investments into those with a higher return. Unfortunately, while market arbitrage ensures that risk-adjusted private rates of return equalize, no similar mechanism exists to guarantee that social rates of return do the same. Thus, society may invest relatively too much in some types of capital and relatively too little in others. History suggests that the United States overinvests in housing.
