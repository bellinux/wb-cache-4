40|$|Mn-Mediated radical {{addition}} {{has been}} developed within the Friestad laboratory as a versatile method toward addition to C=N bonds. N-Acylhydrazones generated by condensation between an aldehyde and an N-acylamine serves as the substrate toward radical addition. A bulky directed group attached with the N-acyl moiety and restricted rotation around N-N bond due to a three point chelation with a Lewis acid differentiates {{the faces of the}} C=N bond of the N-acylhydrazones. Radical generation initiated by photolysis of Mn 2 (CO) 10 causing homolysis of C-X bond in alkyl halide serves as the radical donor to the N-acylhydrazones. Radical addition thereafter occurs stereoselectively from the less hindered face of the C=N bond of the N-acylhydrazones. The product N-acylhydrazines can be effectively transformed to α-chiral amines. In this thesis, a new protocol toward generation of non-proteogenic γ-amino esters using Mn-mediated radical addition has been described. Moreover, the utility of the Mn-mediated radical addition has been demonstrated through studies <b>toward</b> <b>synthesis</b> of tubulysin U and V. Chapter 3 describes a new strategy for asymmetric synthesis of γ-amino esters starting from non-amino precursors. The α-substituted γ-amino esters are prevalent in drugs, drug candidates, and in peptidomimetics. As a part of progressing the Mn-mediated radical addition reaction, highly stereoselective reactions were devised for addition to N-acylhydrazonoesters in absence of Lewis acid. Spectroscopic investigations were carried out to decipher the Lewis acid chelation of N-acylhydrazones. Finally, a novel microwave mediated trifluoroacylation of N-acylhydrazinoesters facilitated the cleavage of N-N bond to liberate γ-aminoester. Chapter 4 describes application of Mn-mediated radical addition <b>toward</b> <b>synthesis</b> of tubulysin natural products. Tubulysins are natural products, isolated from myxobacteria, that have exhibited potent cytotoxicity toward cancer cells in the picomolar regime. The Mn-mediated radical addition was used to prepare two chiral amine subunits in highly diastereoselective fashion. The subunits were then assembled after required manipulations into the tetrapeptide structure characteristic of tubulysins. This strategy to synthesize tubulysins is the most stereoselective of all efforts <b>toward</b> the <b>synthesis</b> of this molecule. <b>Synthesis</b> <b>toward</b> tubulysin was achieved in 18 steps as the longest linear sequence with a 31 % overall yield to tubulysin V in benzyl protected form. Chapter 5 describes a new strategy toward installation of N-hydroxymethyl unit into a peptide chain. N,O-Acetals are acid-base labile species that is present in some tubulysin natural analogs. This new approach exploits Fleming-Tamao oxidation and hence introduce the hydroxymethyl unit of the N,O-acetal in a masked form. Following peptide construction the masked hydroxy group is released to liberate the N-hydroxymethyl moiety. Acylation of the free hydroxy group furnishes the N,O-acetal moiety in a strategy that is potentially applicable <b>toward</b> <b>synthesis</b> of tubulysin D...|$|R

Sequence stratigraphic studies resulted in recognition of 5 Aptian third-order <b>sequences</b> <b>toward</b> Bab Basin (SW—well 1) and 4 Aptian third-order <b>sequences</b> <b>toward</b> Qeshm Island (NE wells 5 and 6). Toward wells 1, 5, and 6, a typical long-lasting transition from carbonate platform to intrashelf basin has been identified. The present of higher gamma ray peaks as maximum flooding surfaces in Apt 2 –Apt 4 indicates {{that there might be a}} good source rock similar to the Arabian Platform. We interpret that salt movement, crustal warping, and basement fault reactivations were probably responsible for creation of an intrashelf basin in Qeshm Island {{and offshore}}. On the other hand, rudist and coral rudstone lithofacies, which probably have good reservoir properties, were deposited mid-ramp during deposition of Apt 3 (wells 2 – 4, 7 and partly in well 1) and Apt 4 (wells 1, 5, and 6) sequences. The Dariyan Formation around Qeshm Island mainly deposited in an intrashelf basin and should be considered as a new intrashelf basin in future Aptian paleogeographic maps.|$|R
40|$|The {{herpesvirus}} maturational proteinase, assemblin, is made as {{a precursor}} that undergoes at least two autoproteolytic cleavages [...] one in a <b>sequence</b> <b>toward</b> its carboxyl end, called the maturational (M) site, and one in a <b>sequence</b> <b>toward</b> its midpoint, called the release (R) site. The M- and R-site sequences are both well conserved among the herpesvirus proteinase homologs, suggesting that the proteinase of one herpesvirus {{might be able to}} cleave the substrates of another. To test this possibility, we cloned and expressed in human cells the long (i. e., full-length open reading frame of proteinase gene) and short (i. e., proteolytic domain, assemblin) forms of the proteinase from human and simian cytomegalovirus (HCMV and SCMV, respectively) and from herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1), as well as the genes for their respective assembly protein precursor substrates. Data from cotransfections of these proteinase genes with appropriate homologous and heterologous substrates showed that although the SCMV and HCMV enzymes cleaved the M-sites of the assembly protein substrates of all three viruses and an SCMV R-site substrate, the HSV- 1 proteinase cleaved only its own substrate. This finding demonstrates that the substrate specificity properties of the HSV- 1 enzyme differ from those of the two CMV enzymes...|$|R
