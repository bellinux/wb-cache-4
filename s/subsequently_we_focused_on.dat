These organisms have acquired an array of survival mechanisms through their evolution, including highly efficient digestive systems. Therefore, the coleopteran intestinal microbiota constitutes {{an important source of}} novel plant cell wall-degrading enzymes with potential biotechnological applications. We isolated and described the cultivable fungi, actinomycetes and aerobic eubacteria associated with the gut of larvae and adults from six different beetle families colonizing decomposing logs in protected Costa Rican ecosystems. We obtained 611 isolates and performed phylogenetic analyses using the ITS region (fungi) and 16 S rDNA (bacteria). The majority of fungal isolates belonged to the order Hypocreales (26 % of 169 total), while the majority of actinomycetes belonged to the genus Streptomyces (86 % of 241 total).

40|$|Various {{arrays of}} microtubules are present {{throughout}} the plant cell cycle and {{are involved in}} distinct functions. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) regulate microtubule dynamics by acting as stabilizers, destabilizers, and promoters of microtubule dynamics. The MAP 65 family is a specific group of cross-linkers required for structural maintenance of microtubules. In plants, different isoforms of MAP 65 are differentially expressed according to their developmental program. In this work, we analyzed the differential distribution of proteins immunologically related to MAP 65 - 1 during bud development in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). First, we annotated the MAP 65 genes present in the Vitis genome in order to compare the number and sequence of genes to other species. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> a specific isoform (MAP 65 - 1) by characterizing its accumulation and distribution.

We found seven spots immunologically related to MAP 65 - 1, grouped in two distinct clusters, which accumulate differentially according to the developmental stage. In addition, we analyzed the localization of MAP 65 - 1 during three different stages of bud development.

We found that the mild detergent n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (β-DM) is suitable for PPC solubilization of spruce tBMs, but longer solubilization and a higher ratio of detergent to total chlorophyll are needed for spruce than are needed for barley. We also unified CN-PAGE protocols to optimize the separation of spruce and barley PPCs that resulted in the separation of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) supercomplexes (SCs), PSI and PSII core dimers, PSII core monomers, trimeric and monomeric light-harvesting complexes of PSII, and bands with free pigments. Studying the effect of elevated temperature on PPCs using CN-PAGE revealed different thermal stability of PPCs in spruce and barley tBMs. Pronounced PPCs changes were observed at temperatures at or above 40 °C. We observed partial disappearance of PSII SCs bands at 44 °C in barley and at 52 °C in spruce. In addition, spruce PSI SCs exhibited slightly higher thermal stability than did barley PSI SCs. The increased thermal stability of spruce tBMS in comparison to that of barley tBM was also confirmed by the circular dichroism spectra of isolated tBMs at different temperatures (Karlický et al. 2015) ...|$|E

40|$|During {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) latency, gene {{expression}} is tightly repressed except for the latency-associated transcript (LAT). The mechanistic basis for this repression is unknown, but its global nature suggests regulation by an epigenetic mechanism such as DNA methylation. Previous work demonstrated that latent HSV- 1 genomes are not extensively methylated, but these studies lacked the resolution to examine methylation of individual CpGs that could repress transcription from individual promoters during latency. To address this point, we employed established models to predict genomic regions with the highest probability of being methylated and, using bisulfite sequencing, analyzed the methylation profiles of these regions. We found no significant methylation of latent DNA isolated from mouse dorsal root ganglia {{in any of the}} regions examined, including the ICP 4 and LAT promoters. This analysis indicates that methylation is unlikely {{to play a major role}} in regulating HSV- 1 latent gene expression. <b>Subsequently</b> <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> differential histone modification as another epigenetic mechanism that could regulate latent transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the latent HSV- 1 DNA repeat regions demonstrated that a portion of the LAT region is associated with histone H 3 acetylated at lysines 9 and 14, consistent with a euchromatic and nonrepressed structure. In contrast, the chromatin associated with the HSV- 1 DNA polymerase gene located in the unique long segment was not enriched in H 3 acetylated at lysines 9 and 14, suggesting a transcriptionally inactive structure. These data suggest that histone composition may be a major regulatory determinant of HSV latency...|$|E

Many organs and systems present several modifications and specialisations and the nervous system either displays peculiar features. Despite {{a strong interest in}} studying these peculiarities, many areas of the cetaceans nervous system lack a detailed anatomical, histological and neurochemical description. The aim of the present research is to investigate the neurochemistry of different central and peripheral regions of the Delphinidae nervous system, including anatomical and histological features. We developed four anatomical studies on the central and peripheral nervous system of dolphins under healthy and pathological conditions. We investigated the architecture and distribution of calretinin-immunoreactivity in the lateral nucleus of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) amygdala, and the Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) expression in the spinal cord and spinal ganglia of the bottlenose dolphin. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> nitrergic and substance P immunoreactive (SP) neurons in the enteric nervous system of the bottlenose dolphin intestine.

40|$|Background/Aims: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the relationship between differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and the pathogenesis of oleic acid (OA) -induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. Methods: Eight-week-old male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were injected with OA through the tail vein and sacrificed 6 hours after OA administration to identify protein expression levels in lung tissue using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) technology. Then, DEPs such as antithrombin III (AT III), 12 -lipoxygenase (12 -LO), dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK 2), polycystin- 2 and plasminogen were identified by western blotting. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> investigating the effect of AT III on endothelial integrity using siRNA interference technology. The levels of IL- 6, IL- 1 β, TNF-α and TGF-β expression were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Alterations in the tight junction component ZO- 1 and the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (pMLC) were determined by western blotting. The stress fiber F-actin were also detected by immunofluorescence staining. In addition, endothelial permeability was determined via a transwell permeability assay. Results: A total of 5152 proteins were found to be expressed in lung tissues from the OA-treated and saline-treated mice. Among these proteins, 849 were differentially expressed between the two groups, including 545 upregulated and 304 downregulated proteins. After AT III knockdown, the levels of inflammatory factors and endothelial permeability were elevated, the expression of ZO- 1 was decreased, and the expression of F-actin and pMLC was increased. All these results illustrated that AT III knockdown exaggerated the disruption of endothelial integrity mediated by OA. Conclusion: These findings using iTRAQ technology demonstrate, for the first time, differences in the lung tissue expression levels of proteins between OA-treated mice and saline-treated mice. This study reveals that 12 -LO, DOCK 2 and especially AT III may be candidate biomarkers for OA-induced acute lung injury...|$|E

40|$|The loss {{of native}} {{riparian}} vegetation and its replacement with non-native species or grazing land for agriculture is a worldwide phenomenon, {{but one that}} is prevalent in Europe, reflecting the heavily-modified nature of the continent's landscape. The consequences of these riparian alterations for freshwater ecosystems remain largely unknown, largely because bioassessment has traditionally focused on the impacts of organic pollution on community structure. We addressed {{the need for a}} broader perspective, which encompasses changes at the catchment scale, by comparing ecosystem processes in woodland reference sites with those with altered riparian zones. We assessed a range of riparian modifications, including clearance for pasture and replacement of woodland with a range of low diversity plantations, in 100 streams to obtain a continental-scale perspective of the major types of alterations across Europe. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> pasture streams, as an especially prevalent widespread riparian alteration, by characterising their structural (e. g. invertebrate and fish communities) and functional (e. g. litter decomposition, algal production, herbivory) attributes in a country (Ireland) dominated by this type of landscape modification, via field and laboratory experiments. We found that microbes became increasingly important as agents of decomposition relative to macrofauna (invertebrates) in impacted sites in general and in pasture streams in particular. Resource quality of grass litter (e. g., carbon : nutrient ratios, lignin and cellulose content) was a key driver of decomposition rates in pasture streams. These systems also relied more heavily on autochthonous algal production than was the case in woodland streams, which were more detrital based. These findings suggest that these pasture streams might be fundamentally different from their native, ancestral woodland state, with a shift towards greater reliance on autochthonous-based processes. This could have a destabilizing effect on the dynamics of the food web relative to the slower, detrital-based pathways that dominate in woodland streams...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of celiac disease (CD) is approximately 1 % worldwide. The disease {{is characterized by}} an immunological response to gluten, the storage protein in wheat, barley and rye. This response causes intestinal inflammation but can also be detected serologically by measuring disease specific (auto-) antibodies. Detecting this immunological response against gluten through histological and/or serological methods {{is used in the}} diagnosis of CD. However, none of these methods is perfect yet, so in this thesis we aimed at improving diagnostic strategies in CD. Small intestinal histology was considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of CD. However, in this thesis we showed that the agreement between 2 pathologists was only moderate, and that disagreement on the final diagnosis is found in almost 10 % of the patients who are suspected to have CD. So, we cannot totally rely only on histology when diagnosing CD. Therefore, when a discrepancy between serology and histology is found, the first step should be to revise the biopsies. Moreover, we also showed that performing CD 3 staining in order to detect intra-epithelial lymphocytes aids in making the correct histological diagnosis. Secondly, we studied methods to improve non-invasive tests in the diagnosis of CD. HLA typing is the best available test to exclude CD, because virtually all patients with CD are either HLA-DQ 2. 5 or HLA-DQ 8 positive. However, in our studies we found that almost 6 % of CD patients lack both HLA-DQ 2. 5 and HLA-DQ 8, but all are HLA-DQ 2. 2 positive. This heterodimer should therefore also be considered as positive when screening for CD. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> serological tests as markers for CD. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against tissue-transglutaminase (tTGA) or endomysium (EMA) are considered to be specific and sensitive screening tools for the disease, although they do not reach 100 % accuracy.

40|$|The {{petrochemical}} industry {{is essential for}} many consumer goods currently in use. Implementing innovative biobased processes, renewable resources are used as substitutes for crude oil in goods such as household detergents, producing bioderived cleaning agents. However, biosurfactants are still expensive compared to their chemically synthesized counterparts. In this work, the exploitation of Pseudomonas putida for the heterologous synthesis of rhamnolipids was the main focus. Rhamnolipids are glycolipids that have a high potential for industrial applications. However, the production of rhamnolipids using the wild-type producer Pseudomonas aeruginosa entails {{a number of significant}} limitations, as P. aeruginosa is a human pathogen, and purification is expensive because rhamnolipid production by P. aeruginosa requires plant oils as a carbon and energy source. Introducing rhamnolipid synthesis genes into P. putida enabled the first microbial cell factory for the production of rhamnolipids from glucose. The synthesis of these secondary metabolites was uncoupled from growth and circumvented sophisticated fermentation procedures. A closer look at the underlying metabolic network during rhamnolipid synthesis revealed that P. putida upregulated its central carbon metabolism {{in order to meet the}} created demand. This finding was exploited as a metabolic engineering strategy and led to the development of a high-producing strain featuring a 3 g/L titer and a 40 % carbon yield. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the enhancement of transcriptional activity by introducing synthetic promoter libraries. This approach was successful, and a wide range of rhamnolipid productivity was achieved; however, the high flux towards the product was unstable in the long run. After establishing rhamnolipid production, we focused on the diversification of the product spectrum. Initially, only mono-rhamnolipids were synthesized. By introducing and eliminating specific genes in the rhamnolipid biosynthesis pathway, we were also able to produce di-rhamnolipids and the rhamnolipid precursor, hydroxyalkanoyloxy alkanoic acid. Lastly, we streamlined the host metabolism and optimized the fermentation conditions, including medium composition. The highest titer was achieved in a fed-batch flask experiment in which 7 g/L of surfactants were produced.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} low tax compliance in Indonesia, focusing {{on the role of}} public officials as taxpayers. Through the analysis of literature and policy documents, we identified four main factors affecting tax compliance: modernized tax administration system (MTAS), tax sanctions, tax services, and tax morale. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the role of public officials. In the scope of Indonesia’s laws and social system, public officials are viewed as representatives of government and as role models (“father-figures”) and change agents. We found that to date no research has been done on tax compliance by public officials specifically. In the first step, we conducted a survey study among 400 respondents working in the public sectors (as government and state enterprise employees). We found that public officials perceive their tax compliance as good, even though they behave far from perfect. The perception of public officials on MTAS and tax services was sufficient, but on tax sanctions and tax morale was bad. In terms of correlations, we found rather low (but significant) correlations with tax compliance for MTAS, tax services, and tax morale, but no significant for tax sanctions. We found similar results when we looked specifically at government and state enterprise employees. In its second (follow-up) step, the empirical research focused on two variables: tax sanctions and tax morale. It consisted of an on-line survey, in-depth face-to-face interviews, and a simulation game. We found that this model worked quite well, in terms of the model as a measurement model. However, as a structural (explanatory) model the captured effect was rather low, and further improvements and extensions are needed. The follow-up research also showed that rewards are potentially more effective in increasing tax compliance than punishment. We recommend the proper use of tax revenues, providing regular and transparent information, and the strong commitment of government in their implementations. For further research, we suggest exploring potential additional underlying factors for tax compliance, clarifying differences in tax compliance between government employees, state enterprise employees and private wolkers, and investigating potential difference between the use of rewards and punishment in raising tax compliance...|$|E
40|$|Cartilage has {{a limited}} {{endogenous}} ability for self-repair and current clinical treatments for damaged or diseased cartilage tissue are insufficient. Additionally, {{there is a}} biological and mechanical interplay between cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone, linking the pathogenesis/regeneration of both tissues. Thus, this thesis seeks to develop hydrogel composites as growth factor and cell delivery vehicles to study the regeneration of osteochondral tissue. First, we investigated the release of growth factors from acellular hydrogel composites containing gelatin microparticles (GMPs) to stimulate the repair of cartilage tissue in an in vivo osteochondral defect model. Transforming growth factor-β 3 (TGF-β 3) with varying release kinetics and/or insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) were delivered from the chondral layer of bilayered hydrogel composites while the subchondral layer remained growth factor-free. Results demonstrated that dual delivery of TGF-β 3 and IGF- 1 did not synergistically enhance cartilage repair, regardless of release kinetics, and the delivery of IGF- 1 alone positively stimulated osteochondral tissue repair. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> improving the repair of the subchondral bone. The second part of this thesis investigated the delivery of IGF- 1 and bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) from the chondral and subchondral layers, respectively, of bilayered scaffolds in vivo. Results showed that BMP- 2 enhanced subchondral bone repair, and that while the dual delivery of both growth factors did not improve cartilage repair, they synergistically enhanced subchondral bone formation over the delivery of IGF- 1 alone. Using {{the results from this}} study, we also investigated relationships between specific cartilage and bone repair metrics to provide a fuller understanding of the osteochondral repair process. Correlation analysis revealed an intrinsic association between the degree of subchondral bone formation and cartilage surface regularity. Lastly, the third part of this thesis investigated the hydrogel composites as stem cell delivery vehicles. Degradable GMPs were used as temporary adherent substrates for anchorage-dependent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs were seeded onto GMPs and subsequently encapsulated in hydrogels to investigate their role on influencing MSC differentiation and aggregation. Non-seeded MSCs co-encapsulated with GMPs in the hydrogels were used as a control for comparison. Results revealed that MSC-seeded GMPs exhibited more cell-cell contacts, greater chondrogenic potential, and a down-regulation of osteogenic markers compared to the controls. Overall, these hydrogel composites demonstrate potential as growth factor and cell delivery vehicles for the stimulation and study of osteochondral tissue regeneration...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this work is the {{structural}} study of the HrcQB protein from the plant pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. Interestingly, high sequence conservations between the HrcQB and homologues from plant and animal pathogens are concentrated at the carboxy-terminal part (79 residues) where our crystallographic study focused. HrcQB is a conserved component of the type III secretion apparatus in Gram-negative bacteria with homologous proteins participating in the export mechanism for the flagellum assembly. The method of X-ray crystallography was used for structure determination. Initially, the full length HrcQB protein, overexressed in Escherichia coli cells, was purified by chromatography. The molecule was very sensitive to proteolysis even {{in the presence of}} protein inhibitors at low temperatures. After the optimization of the purification scheme, stable and pure protein was produced. However, all the crystallization attempts were unsuccessful. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the 79 residues of the C-terminal region (HrcQB-C) where significant similarities with the homologous proteins are observed. The HrcQB-C is a stable molecule and was crystallized with the vapour diffusion method from MPD and Mg(AcO) 2. The crystals were thin plates and most of them exhibited crystal lattice defects that were reflected in the diffraction patterns. All attempts for optimizing the crystals’ quality or finding another crystal form remained unsuccessful. The bad quality {{of the majority of the}} crystals made the solution of the phase problem difficult. We did not find any useful isomorphous heavy atom derivative while the Multiple Anomalous Diffraction technique (MAD) was successful only after the mutation of a leucine in the protein interior to a methionine and then substitution of this methionine by selenomethionine. The substituted mutant was isolated and crystallized without significant deviations from the corresponding conditions of the native protein. The structure was determined from three data sets which were collected at three wavelengths around the absorption edge of selenium and was refined to 2. 3 A resolution. HrcQB-C is an elongated, gently curved homotetramer which can be characterized as an overwhelmingly beta structure. The four monomers assemble into two tightly bound homodimers which are packed together to form a dimer of dimers. There are three indications which support that the tetramer is the biologically relevant molecule: (i) A relatively large, total surface area (~ 1200 A 2) is buried upon tetramer formation via dimer-association. (ii) The tetramer is stabilized by several hydrogen bonds. (iii) The Stokes radius of the protein in solution which was estimated by size exclusion chromatography is in excellent agreement with the value calculated from the crystal structure of the whole tetramer. It is worth noting that the distribution of the conserved residues on the molecular surface is markedly asymmetric, with the majority of them being concentrated on the concave side of the tetramer The striking analogies between HrcQB and its flagellum homologous FliN protein may support the hypothesis that HrcQB participates in the formation of a C-ring like assembly. ...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, via {{impedance}} spectroscopy and transient analysis, we {{confirm that}} di-[4 -(N,N-ditolyl-amino)-phenyl] cyclohexane (TAPC) and 4, 7 -diphenyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline (Bphen) {{can be used}} to play multiple roles in OLEDs. Combined with bipolar transport material 4, 4 ′-N,N′-dicarbazole-biphenyl (CBP), we fabricate efficient trilayer PHOLEDs. Obviously, the performance of trilayer OLED is comparable with the common multilayer OLEDs and even possesses better efficiency roll-off. It is interpreted by the mathematical model of exciton-quenching mechanisms. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the carrier recombination and exciton-quenching mechanisms which occurred in monochromatic phosphorescent devices in order to proceed the further optimization of the structure. With the existence of Langevin and trap-assisted recombination in CBP-doped tris(2 -phenylpyridine) iridium [Ir(ppy) 3] and iridium (III) bis-(2 -methyldibenzo-[f, h] quinoxaline) (acetylacetonate) [Ir(MDQ) 2 (acac)], two exciton-quenching mechanisms, i.e., triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) and triplet–polaron annihilation (TPA), can be observed via the mathematical model.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{a context for}} the {{modeling}} approaches {{that have been developed}} to describe non-Gaussian diffusion behavior, which is ubiquitous in diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging of water in biological tissue. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the formalism of the continuous time random walk theory to extract properties of subdiffusion and superdiffusionthrough novel simplifications of the Mittag-Leffler function. For the case of time-fractional subdiffusion, we compute the kurtosis for the Mittag-Leffler function, which provides both a connection and physical context to the much-used approach of diffusional kurtosis imaging. We provide Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the concepts of anomalous diffusion as stochastic processes of the random walk. Finally, we demonstrate the clinical utility of the Mittag-Leffler function as a model to describe tissue microstructure through estimations of subdiffusion and kurtosis with diffusion MRI measurements in the brain of a chronic ischemic stroke patient...|$|R
40|$|With the {{ubiquity of}} mobile devices, spatial {{crowdsourcing}} is emerging as a new platform, enabling spatial tasks (i. e., tasks related to a location) assigned to and performed by human workers. In this paper, {{for the first time}} we introduce a taxonomy for spatial crowdsourcing. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> one class of this taxonomy, in which workers send their locations to a centralized server and thereafter the server assigns to every worker his nearby tasks with the objective of maximizing the overall number of assigned tasks. We formally define this maximum task assignment (or MTA) problem in spatial crowdsourcing, and identify its challenges. We propose alternative solutions to address these challenges by exploiting the spatial properties of the problem space. Finally, our experimental evaluations on both real-world and synthetic data verify the applicability of our proposed approaches and compare them by measuring both the number of assigned tasks and the travel cost of the workers.
