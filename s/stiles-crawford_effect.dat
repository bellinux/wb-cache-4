50|$|The <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> (subdivided {{into the}} <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> {{of the first}} and second kind) is a {{property}} of the human eye that refers to the directional sensitivity of the cone photoreceptors.|$|E
50|$|Initially, it {{was thought}} that the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> may be caused by the {{screening}} of light that passes {{near the edge of the}} pupil. This possibility was ruled out because variations in light extinction along different light paths through the pupil do not account for the significant reduction in the luminance efficiency. Furthermore, light screening does not explain the significant wavelength dependence of the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect.</b> Due to the large reduction in the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> for rod vision tested under scotopic conditions , scientists concluded that it must be dependent on properties of the retina; more specifically the photon capture properties of the cone photoreceptors.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>Effect</b> is {{quantified}} as {{a function}} of distance (d) away {{from the center of the}} pupil using the following equation: ...|$|E
40|$|Arguments are {{put forward}} {{to explain the}} basic facts about color vision in the frame work of a zone theory, a {{combination}} of the Young-Helmholtz and the Hering theory. Data on wavelength discrimination in particular as a function of luminance, necessitate to assume separate mechanisms for red-green and for yellow-blue discrimination (Hering). Some psychophysical data on the other hand, like the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effects</b> and those on chromatic adaptation, give reason to assume three different visual pigments in the reception, of which the spectral absorption curves and the densities can be derived...|$|R
40|$|The {{changes in}} {{brightness}} and colour of a monochromatic test light as its {{angle of incidence}} on the retina was changed from normal (pupil centre traverse) to oblique (3. 5 mm temporal pupil traverse), was measured by matching it with three normally incident primaries. Results on two normal trichromats were generally in accord with published data on the Stiles-Crawford intensity and colour effects. One observer was also {{the subject of the}} preceding paper (Alpern & Kitahara, 1983) in which the field sensitivities of his foveal IIj(mu) (j = 3, 4, 5) mechanisms for normally, and obliquely, incident backgrounds were reported. For normal incidence, the colour matching functions are in rough accord with expectation if the action spectra of the three cone mechanisms, which provide the photoreceptor basis for his trichromacy, were the same IIj mechanisms for normal incidence. A unified theory is developed for both Stiles-Crawford intensity and colour effects, assuming that the same visual pigments in the same set of univariantly signalling cones absorbs both the normal incident primaries and the obliquely incident test. Given no free parameters for curve fitting, the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> intensity <b>effect</b> data are in reasonable agreement with the theory if the photoreceptor basis of these matches were the normally and obliquely incident IIj(mu) mechanisms. The <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> colour <b>effect</b> data contradict the expectations of the unified theory applied with these same IIj(mu) mechanisms. Either II 3 (mu) is not a valid operational definition of the action spectrum of his short-wave sensitive photoreceptors or at least one assumption of the unified theory is false...|$|R
40|$|Field sensitivities of {{the three}} IIj (j = 3, 4, 5) {{mechanisms}} of Stiles were measured for monochromatic backgrounds of different wave numbers (mu) - 1 traversing the eye through different points (r) displaced along a horizontal chord through {{the centre of the}} entrance pupil. Each mechanism shows an insensitivity to the direction of retinal incidence of short-wave backgrounds not previously described. The spectral densities of the centre-most part of the lens and of the macular pigment were measured on this eye. With reasonable assumptions the former allowed for correction at the receptor level of the directional sensitivity; together with the latter it allowed correction for the spectral sensitivity as well. No correction for the attenuation of the high spatial frequencies of the background as it traversed the pupil at different r was needed. The anomalies of section 2 (above) disappear after correction for losses in the eye media. After these corrections, for every mu and r, the results are well described by the parabola 'tentatively' suggested by Stiles (1939) for each mechanism, allowing only a small amount of variance attributable to experimental imprecision alone. Each mechanism is most sensitive to backgrounds going through essentially the same point of the pupil, independent of background. This result is inconsistent with a qualitative explanation of the 'hue shift' suggested by Safir, Hyams & Philpot (1971). The field sensitivity spectra for backgrounds traversing the pupil at this most effective point and at the 3. 5 mm margin, are the data needed to predict this observer's brightness and colour matches of monochromatic lights passing through the entrance pupil at these two points according to a unified theory of the two <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effects.</b> In the following paper these predictions are quantified and confronted with results of the matching experiments (Alpern, Kitahara & Tamaki, 1982) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{response}} of cone cells to light is also directionally nonuniform, peaking at {{a direction that}} receives light {{from the center of}} the pupil; this effect is known as the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
50|$|Stiles and Crawford {{subsequently}} measured {{this effect}} more precisely by observing the visual stimulus of narrow beams of light selectively passed through various {{positions in the}} pupil using pinholes. Using similar methods, the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> has been verified by the scientific community.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> of {{the second}} kind is the {{phenomenon}} where the observed color of monochromatic light entering the eye {{near the edge of}} the pupil is different compared to that for the same wavelength light entering near the center of the pupil, regardless of the overall intensities of the two lights.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for ray tracing {{in the living}} human eye. It {{consists}} of delivering a narrow light pencil from an unexpanded laser beam and recording the integrated energy and position of the aerial image formed by the outgoing beam (after reflection off the retina and passage through the fully open pupil of the eye and camera lens). The lateral displacement of the aerial image {{is proportional to the}} geometrical aberration (displacement) of the incoming ray at the retina. In addition, its integrated energy is proportional to retinal reflectance that is highly directional [related to the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> (SC) <b>effect</b> and to the effective pupil transmittance]. This method permits us, by delivering rays through different equispaced positions at the pupil plane, to sample the complex pupil function: Its magnitude {{is a measure of the}} effective pupil transmission and its phase is the wave aberration. Experimental results, aberrations, and reflectometric directionality for four subjects are consistent with previous findings. | We propose a new method for ray tracing in the living human eye.

40|$|AbstractThe {{properties}} of small monochromatic targets as accommodative stimuli {{are not well}} understood. We used a dynamic optometer to record accommodation responses to monochromatic disc targets (1. 0 – 27. 3 minarc) and to a Maltese cross. Accommodation responded adequately to points as small as 13. 6 minarc. The response to these small targets is relevant {{to the question of}} whether the <b>Stiles–Crawford</b> (SC) <b>effect</b> could provide a stimulus to accommodation. Previous studies have used pupil apodizing filters to neutralise the natural SC function and so determine how visual performance or accommodation is influenced by the SC effect. However, these filters cannot correct for known inhomogeneities in the SC function across the retina for extended targets. Therefore, we calculated the SC function inhomogeneities across the retinal image of a smaller 13. 6 -minarc target. Unfortunately, even this small target is too large to permit a homogenous SC function across its extent. Alternatives to the apodizing filter approach are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Foveal dark-adaptation {{undertaken}} {{to test the}} hypothesis that the excitation of rods causes the desaturation of 'yellow' lights in a 1 degree field traversing the margin of the pupil, fails to exclude that possibility. The desaturation is largest for a 1 degree outside diameter annular test, is still measurable with a 0. 5 degree circular disk, but disappears for a 0. 29 degree disk. The supersaturation of obliquely incident 501. 2 nm test light follows the opposite pattern; it disappears with an annulus and is largest for a 0. 29 degree circular field. It is unlikely that rods replace short-wave sensitive cones in the trichromatic match of an obliquely incident test with normally incident primaries. If rods as well as all three cones species are involved, the matches might not be trichromatic in the strong sense. Grassmann's law of scalar multiplication was tested and shown not to hold for the match of an obliquely incident test with normally incident primaries, though it remains valid whenever, both primaries and test strike the retina at the same angle of incidence (independent of that angle). The result in section 3 (above) cannot be due to rod intrusion. It persists (and becomes more conspicuous) on backgrounds (4. 0 log scotopic td) which saturate rods. Moreover obliquely incident 'yellow' lights remain desaturated in intervals in the dark after a full bleach, whilst the test field is below rod threshold. The amount of desaturation does not differ appreciably from that normally found. The assumption of the unified theory of Alpern, Kitahara & Tamaki (1983) that the outer segments of only a single set of three cone species (with acceptance angles wide enough to include the entire exit pupil) contain the visual pigments absorbing both the normally incident primaries and the obliquely incident test is disproved by these results. Failure of Grassmann's law is most conspicuous under the conditions for which the changes in saturation upon changing from normal to oblique incidence are greatest and least when the saturation changes are the smallest. Either all unified theories of the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effects</b> are wrong or all the effects of oblique incidence operate at a stage in the visual process at which the effects of radiation of different wave-lengths are no longer compounded by the simple linear laws...|$|R
5000|$|... where p(&lambda;) is a {{wavelength}} {{dependent parameter}} {{which represents the}} magnitude of the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect,</b> with larger values of p corresponding to a stronger falloff in the relative luminance efficiency as a function of distance {{from the center of the}} pupil. Measurements indicate that the value of p(&lambda;) ranges from 0.05 to 0.08.|$|E
50|$|Measurements of the {{relative}} luminance efficiency are typically largest and symmetric about some distance (dm), which is typically ranges from -0.2 to -0.5 mm, away {{from the center of}} the pupil towards the nasal side. The significance of the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> is evident the drop of relative luminance efficiency by up to 90% for light entering near the edge of the pupil.|$|E
50|$|Electromagnetic {{analysis}} of light rays incident on a model human cone {{revealed that the}} <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> is explained by the shape, size, and refractive indices of the various parts of cone photoreceptors, which are roughly oriented towards {{the center of the}} pupil. Since the width of human cone cells is on the order of two micrometers, which is on a similar order of magnitude as the wavelength of visible light, electromagnetic analysis indicated that the light capture phenomena in human cone cells are similar to those observed in optical waveguides. More specifically, due the narrow confinement of light within cone protoreceptors, destructive or constructive interference of the electromagnetic field may occur within the cone photoreceptors for particular wavelengths of light, thus significantly affecting the overall absorption of light by the photopigment molecules. This was the first analysis that sufficiently explained the non-monotonic wavelength dependence of p parameter that describes the strength the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{effective}} optical {{density of the}} cones are sufficient to explain changes in color matches with retinal illuminance and pupil entry. We performed three experiments. In the first experiment, six observers made color matches under both bleached and unbleached conditions {{to a series of}} six standard wavelengths. The effects of bleaching could be modeled by a decrease in optical density of the L and M cone photopigments. Slight spectral shifts in the peak wavelengths of the photopigments were required for different observers. In the second experiment we varied retinal illuminance of the color-matching field from 2. 4 to 5. 4 log Td for a series of long-wavelength primaries. The shape of the color match versus the intensity function was un-changed by the wavelength composition of the matching field. In the third experiment we measured the change in color match with retinal illuminance for different pupil entry positions. At low luminances there was a marked dependence of the color match on pupil entry positions. At high illuminance there was only a small dependence. The half-bleach illuminance values varied as expected from the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> I <b>effect.</b> We conclude that for wavelengths> 540 nm, changes in color matches with bleaching and pupil entry can be explained by changes in {{the effective}} optical density of the cones. 1...|$|R
50|$|Both of the Stiles-Crawford {{effects of}} the first and second kind are highly wavelength-dependent, and they are most evident under {{photopic}} conditions. There are several factors that contribute to the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect,</b> though it is generally accepted that it is primarily a result of the guiding properties of light of the cone photoreceptors. The reduced sensitivity to light passing {{near the edge of the}} pupil enhances human vision by reducing the sensitivity of the visual stimulus to light that exhibits significant optical aberrations and diffraction.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{research}} {{has attempted to}} extend {{the basis for the}} traditional chromostereoptic theory, including work done by Stiles and Crawford. In 1933, Stiles and Crawford accidentally discovered that the light sensitivity differed for rays entering through center versus those entering from peripheral regions of the eye. The efficiency of the rays is less when the rays enter via the peripheral region because the shape of the cone cells that collect the incident quanta are different from cone receptors {{in the center of the}} eye. This effect can cause both positive and negative chromostereopsis depending on the position of the pupil. If the pupil is centered on optical axis, it causes positive chromostereopsis. However, if the pupil is significantly off-center from the optical axis, negative chromostereopsis will ensue. Because most people have a point of maximum luminous efficiency that is off-center, the Stiles-Crawford Effects generally will have [...] chromostereoptic effects. Therefore, instead of seeing red in front of blue, blue will be seen in front of red and the effect will be reversed. The <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> also explains why positive chromostereopsis is decreased when illumination is lowered. At lower illumination, the dilation of pupil increases the pupillary peripheral region and therefore increases the magnitude of the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1933, Stiles and Crawford {{discovered}} that the light sensitivity of the fovea differs significantly for rays entering the eye {{through the center of}} the pupil versus rays entering from its peripheral regions. They observed that the usual [...] "intensity multiplied by aperture" [...] rule did not apply in foveal vision and that rays entering the eye via peripheral regions of the pupil were less efficient by roughly a factor of five. This effect is now known as the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> and also has implications for the reverse chromostereoptic effect.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> of {{the first}} kind is the {{phenomenon}} where light entering the eye {{near the edge of}} the pupil produces a lower photoreceptor response compared to light of equal intensity entering near the center of the pupil. The photoreceptor response is significantly lower than expected by the reduction in the photoreceptor acceptance angle of light entering {{near the edge of the}} pupil. Measurements indicate that the peak photoreceptor sensitivity does not occur for light entering the eye directly through the center of the pupil, but at an offset of approximately 0.2-0.5 mm towards the nasal side.|$|E
5000|$|However, due to {{simplicity}} of the cone models {{and the lack of}} accurate knowledge of the optical parameters of the human cone cell used in the electromagnetic analysis, it is unclear whether other factors such as the photopigment concentrations [...] may contribute to the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect.</b> Due to the complexity of a single cone photoreceptor and the layers of the retina which lie ahead of the cone photoreceptor on the light path, as well as the randomness associated with the distribution and orientation of cone photoreceptors, it is extremely difficult to fully model all of the factors which may affect the production of the visual stimulus in an eye.|$|E
5000|$|The {{binocular}} {{nature of}} the chromostereopsis was discovered by Bruecke and arises due {{to the position of}} the fovea relative to the optical axis. The fovea is located temporally to the optical axis and as a result, the visual axis passes through the cornea with a nasal horizontal eccentricity, meaning that the average ray bound for the fovea must undergo prismatic deviation and is thus subject to chromatic dispersion. The prismatic deviation is in opposite directions in each eye, resulting in opposite color shifts that lead to a shift in stereoptic depth between red and blue objects. The eccentric foveal receptive system, along with the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect,</b> work in opposite directions of one another and roughly cancel out, offering another explanation to why subjects may show color stereoscopy [...] "against the rule" [...] (a reversal of the expected results).|$|E
40|$|The <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> {{is often}} invoked by vision {{scientists}} when {{predictions of the}} effects of aberrations and defocus on spatial visual performance are not borne out experimentally. Modeling the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> as an apodization, we investigated the expected influence that it would have on spatial visual performance in the presence of 1 -diopter primary spherical aberration {{at the edge of a}} 6 -mm-diameter centered pupil. The changes in refraction produced by a high <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect,</b> according to various criteria, were small at approximately 0. 10 diopter. The <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> has only a small capability to compensate for defocus and spherical aberration. These results indicate that the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> has little influence on spatial visual performance in the case of centered pupils. We suggest that the faith that has often been placed in the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> to account for discrepancies between experimental results and expected results is not justified, at least for well-centered pupils and Stiles-Crawford effects...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} color-match-area effect and the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> in 10 {{observers}} with age-related macular changes. Observers were graded {{on a scale}} of I to IV according to the Sarks classification, which correlates fundus appearance and visual acuity with the severity of postmortem histological changes in Bruch's membrane. Observ-ers in group II showed subtle abnormalities of color matching; those in groups III and IV showed more-severe abnormalities. The <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> was abnormal in 9 of 10 eyes tested. Only one observer showed a <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> that had a well-defined peak {{near the center of the}} pupil and a near-normal bandpass. The results suggest that early age-related changes visible in the fundus can be revealed by psychophysical tests of photoreceptor architecture...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> of {{the first}} kind {{describes}} a gradually diminished visibility of light that enters the eye towards the pupil rim. Although of retinal origin, it is commonly described by a Gaussian pupil apodization whose width is determined by a directionality parameter that depends on retinal eccentricity, wavelength and spatial coherence of the light. As the measurements are done psychophysically they are prone to subjective variations and difficult to obtain across the visible spectrum. In this work, requirements for accurate refractive correction when determining the directionality parameter at any given wavelength are discussed and we show that a current-controlled tunable liquid-polymer lens provides a convenient means to accomplish this without requiring mechanical readjustments. This {{may be the most}} convenient way to combat defocus across the visible spectrum in the analysis of the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> as demonstrated through experiments and with a detailed Zemax eye-and-system analysis...|$|E
40|$|A semi-automated bipartite Maxwellian {{illumination}} system {{was used to}} examine the Stiles–Crawford effects of the first and second kind for the fovea of the authors’ eyes. The illumination was realised with a tungsten–halogen source in combination with tuneable liquid-crystal spectral filters. Visibility and hueshift dependencies were examined spatially and spectrally. They {{have been found to be}} in fair agreement with former studies in terms of overall appearance but with a notable reduction in directionality for the blue spectral range. The observations are discussed in relation to recent theory that relates the <b>Stiles–Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> of the second kind to the <b>Stiles–Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> of the first kind via a pigment-specific colour visibility function. The results confirm a direct relationship between the two effects and a reduction in hueshift for narrowband illumination. Differences in the green spectral range remain, however, that may be a consequence of a different directionality of S-cones as compared to the M- and L-cones...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn 1958, Campbell {{observed}} that certain artificial pupil displacements could considerably change acuity (measured by viewing gratings) while others {{had very little}} effect. He sought {{an explanation of the}} small retinal contribution to those effects that was consistent with the <b>Stiles-Crawford</b> <b>effect.</b> This paper suggests an explanation that satisfies that requirement using a waveguide model of the retinal cones. We show that the waveguiding properties of the receptors make them sensitive to obliquely incident exciting waves and this provides some support for the hypothesis that both the Stiles-Crawford and Campbell effects are manifestations of the same underlying waveguide nature of the receptors...|$|E
40|$|THE <b>Stiles–Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> 1, 2, or the {{dependence}} of luminous efficiency on the eccentricity of the point of entry of {{the light in the}} pupil, {{is a function of the}} wavelength of the light. In Fig. 1 is given the inverse 1 / of the luminous efficiency as a function of wave-length at a distance of 3. 5 mm from the point of maximum efficiency, according to the measurements of Stiles 3. In the same graph is a theoretical curve according with the explanation by Walraven and Bouman 4. The dip in the curve in the yellow-green is due to the high absorption (about 80 percent) by the visual pigments of perpendicularly incident light in that region of the spectrum. Perpendicularly, light traverses the whole amount of pigment, while obliquely incident light leaks out of the receptor and therefore has a much shorter absorbent pathway to travel. But shortening of the pathway through a solution of high optical density is accompanied by a narrowing of the spectral absorption curves of the pigments. In other words, when the pigment has a high absorption, there is only a small chance that light will leak out of the receptor obliquely, so that nearly all of it will be absorbed. With low density, however, there is more opportunity for leakage, which is why the <b>Stiles–Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> is larger at both ends of tlrs spectrum than in the middle...|$|E

Transverse aberrations were measured using a vernier alignment technique in three subjects, with the natural SCE operating, with the SCE neutralised by filters optically conjugate with the eye’s pupil, and for one subject with filters that shifted the SCE by more than 2 mm.

The SCE was modeled as a pupil apodization. The SCE appears to improve image quality by providing compensation for aberrations induced by pupil decentration, but this improvement is usually small. When a criterion of the placement of the image is used as the centroid of the line-spread function, an average SCE reduces the influence of pupil decentration on subjective transverse chromatic aberrations (TCA's) for 5 -mm-diameter pupils by 30...|$|E
40|$|Stiles and Crawford showed over 75 {{years ago}} that the {{sensitivity}} of the retina varies with the place of entry of the light into the pupil, and thus with the direction of incidence of light upon the retina. The effect is a property of the cones. Rods have a very limited directional sensitivity with a common centre of symmetry with the hotopic SC-function. One reason, amongst others, for the existence of the <b>Stiles–Crawford</b> <b>effect</b> {{is supposed to be the}} suppression of stray light in the ocular media. The light from, for example, the sun or the bright sky, will be scattered in the ocular media, and cause a haze over the visual scene, thereby decreasing contrast. Thanks to the <b>Stiles–Crawford</b> <b>effect,</b> this scattered light will not be perceived. In order to judge the weight, with respect to other reasons, of this stray light theory, a quantitative study of the amount of stray light is required. This suggestion is based on indications that the scattering in the ocular media is mainly forward scattering, and that stray light coming from the retina seems not to contribute much either. Indirect evidence in favour of the stray light hypothesis is that in nighttime conditions, the visual surround is dark, disturbing stray light does not exist, and the rods therefore do not need directional sensitivity. This is indeed the case, and therefore the pupil size is fully used for the few incoming light quanta. At mesopic levels, the disturbing effects of a large pupil, such as spherical and chromatic aberrations, will be limited for the cones by their directional sensitivity, in the same way as a small pupil does at high luminance levels. It is therefore proposed to consider the directional sensitivity of cones as a virtual pupil...|$|E

Variation of image quality with focus is evaluated with a double-pass technique. Objective DOF is defined as the dioptric range for which the image quality does not change appreciably, based on optical criteria. Subjective DOF is based on the accuracy of focusing a point source. Additional DOFs are obtained by simulation from experimental wavefront aberration data from the same subjects.

The technique is not significantly affected by reflections at the limiting membrane, or by changes in entrance and exit pupil configuration, or by location of bleaching light entry.
