5|$|Although Batman Returns was a {{financial}} success, Warner Bros. felt the film <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> more money. The studio {{decided to change}} {{the direction of the}} Batman film series to be more mainstream. Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton as director, while Burton decided to stay on as producer. However, Michael Keaton did not like the new direction the film series was heading in, and was replaced by Val Kilmer as Batman. Chris O'Donnell was introduced as Robin, Jim Carrey starred as The Riddler, while Tommy Lee Jones starred as Two-Face. Filming started in September 1994, and Schumacher encountered problems communicating with Kilmer and Jones. Batman Forever was released on June 16, 1995 with financial success, earning over $350 million worldwide and three Academy Award nominations, but the film was met with mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, {{due to the}} weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large metacentric height, which <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. Bilge keels were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard rudder.|$|E

As a result of the accident, all departures until 22 November were cancelled. Investigations revealed that the cause for the accident was the new duty rosters: the officer on duty was inspecting the new roster and because of that failed to notice that the ship <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a course change whilst approaching Mariehamn.|$|E
25|$|Since rabbinical sources held Judah to {{have been}} the leader of his brothers, these sources also hold him {{responsible}} for this deception, even if it was not Judah himself who brought the coat to Jacob. Even if Judah had been trying to save Joseph, the classical rabbinical sources still regard him negatively for it; these sources argue that, {{as the leader of the}} brothers, Judah <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> more effort, and carried Joseph home to Jacob on his (Judah's) own shoulders. These sources argue that Judah's brothers, after witnessing Jacob's grief at the loss of Joseph, deposed and excommunicated Judah, as the brothers held Judah entirely responsible, since they would have brought Joseph home if Judah had asked them to do so. Divine punishment, according to such classical sources, was also inflicted on Judah in punishment; the death of Er and Onan, and of his wife, are portrayed in by such classical rabbis as being acts of divine retribution.|$|E
25|$|Former President Joseph Estrada {{expressed}} condemnation {{towards the}} rebels {{saying that a}} peace talk with them would not work and believes a declaration of an all-out war against them is only {{the solution to the}} peace process in Mindanao. Former President Fidel V. Ramos remains supportive of the peace process even though he explains that the finalization of the peace process may be after President Benigno Aquino III's term. Despite his expression of support towards the peace process, Ramos still criticized Aquino saying “There should be no hesitation {{on the part of the}} commander in chief. Otherwise, it will be part of your legacy to be always hesitant, flip-flopping.” He criticized Aquino, who is also the commander-in-chief of the PNP and the AFP, for his apparent poor strategic direction and asserts that it is the soldier, the policeman, the law enforcer, the guardian of security that suffers because of his decisions. Ramos also insists that Aquino <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> consultation with retired police officers and soldiers before the security operation in Mamasapano.|$|E

25|$|The torrid scoring pace slowed {{during much}} of the third quarter, as both teams began to assert {{themselves}} on the defensive side of the ball. But late in the quarter, a 12-yard punt return by Cowboys receiver Butch Johnson gave Dallas good field position on their 42-yard line. The Cowboys subsequently drove down to the Steelers 10-yard line, mostly with Dorsett's rushing. Then on third down with less than three minutes remaining in the period, Staubach spotted 38-year-old reserve tight end Jackie Smith wide open in the end zone and threw him the ball. Head coach Tom Landry said Staubach tried to throw the ball soft when he saw how wide open Smith was and that it came in low, and that when Smith tried to stop, his feet seemed to come out from under him. Jackie Smith states that it was still a catchable ball and that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the play. Instead, Smith dropped the pass and the Cowboys had to settle for a field goal from kicker Rafael Septién, cutting their deficit to 21–17. Though Smith played 16 years in the league and is now enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he is perhaps best known for this dropped touchdown, particularly in a championship game that was ultimately decided by four points.|$|E

Daybreaker had the same production and engineering team as did Hollow Crown; John Mitchell acted as Daybreaker's mixing engineer, and Mitchell described Daybreaker as [...] "the album they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> after Hollow Crown". Tom Searle said that during the recording, he and Hillier-Brook were constantly practising to perfect the highly technical guitar riffs.|$|E

500|$|Campbell {{gained control}} of the city at the cost to his forces of seven killed and {{seventeen}} wounded, not including the four men killed and five wounded during preliminary skirmishing. [...] Campbell took 453 prisoners, and {{there were at least}} 83 dead and 11 wounded from Howe's forces. [...] When Howe's retreat ended at Purrysburg, South Carolina he had 342 men left, less than half his original army. [...] Howe would receive much of the blame for the disaster, with William Moultrie arguing that he should have either disputed the landing site in force or retreated without battle to keep his army intact. [...] He was exonerated in a court martial that inquired into the event, although the tribunal pointed out that Howe <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a stand at the bluffs or more directly opposed the landing.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, Jackson {{won three}} awards at the American Music Awards for his solo efforts: Favorite Soul/R Album, Favorite Male Soul/R Artist and Favorite Soul/R Single (for [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"). That year, he also won Billboard Music Awards for Top Black Artist and Top Black Album and a Grammy Award for Best Male R Vocal Performance (for [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"). Despite its {{commercial}} success, Jackson felt Off the Wall <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> {{a much bigger}} impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release. In particular, Jackson was disappointed that he had won only a single Grammy Award at the 1980 Grammys, a Grammy Award for Best Male R Vocal Performance for [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". Jackson stated that [...] "It was totally unfair that it didn't get Record of the Year and it can never happen again".|$|E
500|$|After Atkinson's {{arrival at}} Rock Island on April 12, 1832, he, Keokuk, and Meskwaki chief Wapello sent emissaries to the British Band, {{which was now}} {{ascending}} the Rock River. Black Hawk rejected the messages advising him to turn back. Colonel Zachary Taylor, a regular army officer who served under Atkinson, later stated that Atkinson <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> an attempt to stop the British Band by force. Some historians have agreed, arguing that Atkinson could have prevented the outbreak of war with more decisive action or astute diplomacy. Cecil Eby charged that [...] "Atkinson was a paper general, unwilling to proceed until all risk had been eliminated". Kerry Trask, however, argued that Atkinson was correct in believing {{that he did not}} yet have enough troops to stop the British Band. According to Patrick Jung, leaders on both sides had little chance of avoiding bloodshed at this point, because the militiamen and some of Black Hawk's warriors were spoiling for a fight.|$|E

500|$|On December 19, 1991, {{the band}} played their final show of the tour in Hollywood at the Whisky a Go Go opening for The Smashing Pumpkins, which ended with Love smashing her guitar {{headstock}} onstage {{at the end of}} their set after lukewarm reception from the audience. Los Angeles Times journalist David Cromelin noted in his review of the concert: Smashing Pumpkins' singer-guitarist Billy Corgan referred to himself as [...] "a frustrated Midwestern youth" [...] at the Whisky on Tuesday... Smashing Pumpkins was preceded by smashing guitars, courtesy of Hole. The tortured, transfixing L.A. group's pairing with the headliners <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> this a bill to remember, but the audience was primed for Pumpkin and didn't take to Courtney Love's powerful howls of anguish. Hole ended its set in a tantrum, as Love ordered the band to halt and hurled her guitar to the ground. Guitarist Eric Erlandson finished things off by demolishing his instrument with a few impressive swings. Frustrated Midwestern youth, meet frustrated California youth.|$|E
500|$|Davies {{believed}} that Lee's film did not overcome [...] "the {{problem of the}} guys who get the girls not seeming quite good enough", and set out {{to try to find a}} way of making them into heroes in his script. He said that Austen <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the reader feel that Edward was worthy of Elinor and explained how Marianne falls in love with Colonel Brandon, after having her heart broken by Willoughby. The writer increased the male roles, so they could be turned into stronger characters. Davies told Hill that the team [...] "worked very hard" [...] on the men. Brandon is seen rescuing people and doing a lot of fast horse riding, while Edward was given a wood-chopping scene where he vents his frustrations about his engagement. Davies also made the Dashwood sisters younger and [...] "more vulnerable" [...] than how they were portrayed in Lee's film. Hattie Morahan, who portrayed Elinor in the drama, stated, [...] "We are trying to play the story as it was written. In the novel the girls are 19 and 17, so these romantic relationships are real rites of passage for them." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Paper Clip" [...] has {{received}} highly positive reviews from critics, who generally consider {{it among the}} best of the series. In an overview of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Paper Clip" [...] was rated as A−. It was called an [...] "outstanding episode", although Scully's unwillingness to accept the paranormal after making contact was seen as [...] "exacerbat a maddening trend". Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode an A+. He felt that its strengths came from its parallels with real world history, such as its handling of Operation Paperclip and the actions of the West during the Cold War, noting that [...] "the compromises the United States and other Western nations made to survive the onslaught of communism in the Cold War were ones that <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> more of those nations' citizens take pause, stop to think about the cost of living free, but they almost never did". The episode, along with both other parts of the story arc, were listed concurrently as the second-best episode of the series by Den of Geek's Nina Sordi. Sordi noted that the plotline [...] "laid the groundwork for the mythology arc {{for the rest of the}} series", adding that it [...] "brought much more significance to what is to come".|$|E
