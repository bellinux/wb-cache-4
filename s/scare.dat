5|$|After {{the release}} of Kids Can Say No!, many {{teachers}} who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of {{how to deal with}} the disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the <b>Scare.</b> Kids Can Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the <b>Scare</b> advises teachers about what to do if a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the <b>Scare,</b> {{filmed in}} a North London school, {{consists}} of role-playing scenes with actual teachers. The film instructs teachers {{to listen to}} the child, to discuss the incident with the child's parents and to contact the appropriate authorities. The Tavistock Clinic helped with the film's production, and an expert from the organisation appears on-camera to promote child protection projects in schools. Although Harris appears in Beyond the <b>Scare,</b> his role is less prominent than in Kids Can Say No! and his activism against child abuse ended soon afterwards.|$|E

40|$|Summary 1. Increasing {{population}} {{sizes of}} geese are {{the cause of}} numerous agricultural conflicts in many regions of the Northern Hemisphere. <b>Scaring</b> is often used {{as a tool to}} chase geese away from fields, either as a means to protect vulnerable crops or as part of goose management schemes to drive geese to accommodation areas. Geese are quick to habituate to stationary <b>scaring</b> devices; hence, active <b>scaring</b> by humans is often employed. However, it remains undocumented how much effort is required for active <b>scaring</b> to be effective. 2. We explored the relationship between intensity of active human <b>scaring</b> on field use and behaviour by geese. Using an experimental framework, we applied four different <b>scaring</b> doses per day (geese were <b>scared</b> either 2, 5, 7 or 10 times per day), to random pastures in a pink-footed goose spring staging area in mid-Norway, and recorded goose flock sizes, fleeing response distances, and average weekly goose densities assessed by dropping densities. In addition, we counted droppings in fields without <b>scaring.</b> We used mixed models to test for changes in the effects of different <b>scaring</b> doses over time and compared observed with predicted dropping levels. 3. Cumulative dropping densities increased at different rates depending on the <b>scaring</b> dose. <b>Scaring</b> dosage did not affect flock size and fleeing response distance during the study period, but both flock sizes and fleeing response distances changed with time. 4. <b>Scaring</b> dose 2 did not show any decrease in relative goose use compared to the fields without <b>scaring,</b> whereas doses 5, 7 and 10 all showed 74 – 78 % fewer droppings {{by the end of the}} spring staging period, indicating a possible threshold between dose 2 and 5. The largest effect of <b>scaring</b> appeared during the first week of <b>scaring.</b> 5. Synthesis and applications. This study is the first to show a dose–response relationship between active <b>scaring</b> and field use of flocking geese. For individual farmers, the study provides guidance on the level of <b>scaring</b> effort needed to be cost-effective. If implemented as part of a management scheme with subsidy/accommodation areas in combination with systematic and persistent <b>scaring,</b> it can be used as a tool to keep geese away from areas where they are not wanted, thereby assisting in the alleviation of goose–agriculture conflicts. The approach in this study can be adapted and used in a wider range of wildlife interactions with human economic interests...|$|R

He attempted to be reinstated but never was even after the legislation that had been developed during the Red <b>Scare</b> was later deemed unconstitutional.|$|E
