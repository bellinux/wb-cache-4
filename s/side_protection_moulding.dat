40|$|This report {{describes}} a Dutch demonstration project concerning <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> for trucks. The {{aim of this}} project was to gain practical experience in: the purchase, fitting and maintenance of side protection; driving trucks with side protection; the fuel consumption of these trucks; and in any damage or accidents involving the vehicles in question. The project also included a practical test to determine the `subjective safety feelings' of cyclists and pedestrians in relation to trucks with <b>side</b> <b>protection.</b> For the project, 42 closed trucks and 27 articulated trucks belonging to the Van Gend & Loos transport company were employed. Over a period of six months, this transport company recorded the fuel consumption company recorded the fuel consumption of 28 trucks and 14 articulated trucks fitted with <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> and of vehicles {{that were part of}} a control group. At the same time, the road transport department of the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) carried out separate measurements under controlled conditions using an articulated truck and a closed truck. The study showed {{that in the case of}} closed trucks a saving of 4 - 5 % can be achieved. In the case of articulated trucks, a not insignificant saving of 1 - 2 % was determined...|$|R
5000|$|The Sverdlov-class cruisers were {{improved}} and slightly enlarged {{versions of the}} [...] They had the same main armament, machinery and <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> as the earlier ships, but had increased fuel capacity for greater range, an all welded hull, improved underwater protection, increased anti-aircraft artillery and radar.|$|R

50|$|The Portland class {{originally}} had 1 in armor for deck and <b>side</b> <b>protection,</b> but in construction {{they were given}} belt armor between 5 in (around the magazines) and 3.25 in in thickness. Armor on the bulkheads was between 2 in and 5.75 in; that on the deck was 2.5 in, the barbettes 1.5 in, the gunhouses 2.5 in, and the conning tower 1.25 in.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the complete vehicle weighs around 40,000 lbs and costs about $500,000 (three times more than a Humvee). The Bull prototypes had two side hatches at the front (meeting MRAP II specs), used mainly for emergency exits. This design gave more <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> than larger traditional doors. The Bull had no gun ports, but these could be added in the final production model.|$|R
50|$|Modern fell running {{trainers}} use light, non-waterproof {{material to}} eject water and dislodge peat after traversing boggy ground. While the trainer {{needs to be}} supple, to grip an uneven, slippery surface, a degree of <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> against rock and scree (loose stones) may be provided. Rubber studs have been the mode for two decades, preceded by ripple soles, spikes and the flat soled ‘pumps’ of the fifties.|$|R

50|$|The use of {{aluminum}} armor and {{the storage of}} large quantities of ammunition in the vehicle initially raised questions about its combat survivability. Spaced laminate belts and high hardness steel skirts {{have been added to}} improve the <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> of later versions, although this increases overall weight to 33 tons. In friendly fire incidents in Desert Storm, many crew members survived hits that resulted in total losses for lighter U.S. Marine Corps LAV-25 vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, Wasp was {{launched}} {{with almost no}} armor, modest speed and, more significantly, no protection from torpedoes. Absence of <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> of the boilers and internal aviation fuel stores [...] "doomed her to a blazing demise". These were inherent design flaws that were recognized when constructed but could not be remedied within the allowed tonnage. These flaws, combined with a relative lack of damage control experience {{in the early days}} of the war, were to prove fatal.|$|R

50|$|Manufacturers offer {{a variety}} of styles and colors to meet {{different}} needs and preferences. Some make claims of superior <b>side</b> <b>protection,</b> comfort, anti-fog coatings, interchangeable lenses, transition lenses, etc. At least one product from more than a half dozen manufacturers are listed on the U.S. Army’s Authorized Protective Eyewear List (APEL). Some options, including the Wiley X PT-1 and Talon as well as Revision's Sawfly and the Desert Locust Goggle can be obtained in prescription lenses that meet the ballistic protection standards.|$|R

50|$|The IOTV {{provides}} {{the ability to}} don the vest in two ways. The first is to simply place the vest over the head and pull down, {{and the second is}} to remove fasteners on the wearer's left shoulder, sliding into the vest to the right. To complete the procedure for both methods the wearer then lifts up the front panel of the vest and fastens the waistband, which takes the weight of the vest off the shoulders somewhat, and then fastens the <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> modules.|$|R
40|$|This {{cost-benefit}} analysis helps road hauliers to select profitable measures.
