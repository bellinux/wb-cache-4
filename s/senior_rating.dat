40|$|A large {{national}} sample {{of high school}} <b>seniors</b> <b>rated</b> their preferences for the allocation of work and family duties within their own prospective marriages.

Virtually all seniors view less than full-time employment by the husband as unacceptable. With regard to child care and housework, most seniors prefer equal sharing between the spouses.
