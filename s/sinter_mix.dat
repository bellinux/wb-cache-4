40|$|Major {{structural}} change occurs during sintering on melt formation. Melts activate surface forces that drive coalescence processes, as surface energy is reduced. The {{extent to which}} coalescence occurs depends {{on the relationship between}} surface and viscous forces, which in turn are determined by composition and temperature. In this study, a coal ash fusion furnace was utilised to investigate the impact of composition and temperature on analogue <b>sinter</b> <b>mix</b> tablet reshaping over alumina tiles. <b>Sinter</b> <b>mix</b> compositions were comparable to small size fractions of plant sinter mixes; as they are the first to form melt during sintering operations. A factorial experiment showed basicity to be the dominant driver for reshaping with increasing temperature. Alumina was found to retard reshaping, but only at low sintering temperatures. Material properties, calculated using FactSage and published correlations, were determined as a way to investigate forces acting in the system. Results showed the main determinant of reshaping was apparent viscosity, which was primarily dependent on the amount of melt formed in the <b>sinter</b> <b>mix.</b> The study also used a novel experimental technique, which demonstrated the ability of surface forces to drive reshaping and surface energy reduction when the tablet was suspended from a downward facing tile. This study found that while melt surface tension and wetting behaviour drive system reshaping to reduce surface energy, the extent of <b>sinter</b> <b>mix</b> reshaping was predominately determined by resistance from viscous forces...|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} of sufficient melt of appropriate properties {{is essential for}} the transformation of a blended <b>sinter</b> <b>mix</b> bed into a bed composed of large discrete sinter particles. For a chosen <b>sinter</b> <b>mix,</b> melt properties are determined by the quantity of heat transferred from the moving flame front and the chemical properties of the bed. Temperature-time profiles from embedded thermocouples are used to assess the transferred heat. From considerations of melt initiation and solidification temperatures, a critical sintering reaction area in the profiles is defined. The area is about three times the flame front area as it includes high temperature regions outside the front. It represents the total amount of heat available to the material in the partially molten state. Reasonable correlations are obtained between this area and the tumble strength of the sinter product. Temperature-time profiles are quite variable and strong correlations cannot be expected...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{optimise}} the grain size distribution of the raw material mixture for the production of iron sinter. It well known that the constitution of the <b>sinter</b> <b>mix</b> is based on the knowledge of chemical composition and grain size distribution. Although Mittal Vanderbijlpark has fixed specifications on the physical and chemical properties of the sinter for optimal blast furnace performance, the particle size distribution of the <b>sinter</b> <b>mix</b> has not yet been optimized. This was achieved by using the granulation characteristics of the <b>sinter</b> <b>mix</b> and the green bed permeability tests. The influence of the moisture content of the feed, granulation time, and mean granule diameter on permeability was investigated on Thabazimbi and Sishen iron ore, as well as on their mixture with fluxes and without fluxes. The iron ore results indicated that the mixture containing 20 % Thabazimbi iron ore and 80 % Sishen iron ore with fluxes where the coke, lime and return fines were sized by removing the – 0. 5 mm size fraction of the return fines and coke, and the 1 mm size fraction of lime has the highest permeability of all the studied mixtures. The sintering properties of the mixtures of optimised grain size distributions were also investigated and the results were very similar for all the mixtures and better than the base case mixture, which was not optimised with respect to grain size distribution.

40|$|Iron ore {{sintering}} is {{a complex}} agglomeration process that converts iron ore fines into a lumpy form suitable for charging into an ironmaking blast furnace. To achieve agglomeration iron ore fines are mixed with coke (fuel) and fluxes (which promote melt formation). During sintering high temperatures (~ 1350 °C) are reached and melts form amongst ore particles. Major structural transformation occurs in this high temperature region, where the packed bed of granulated material transforms into a bed with large agglomerated regions and voids. There is limited understanding of the forces driving agglomeration {{and it is not}} possible to observe the transformation process in-situ. Sintering melts play a fundamental role in driving structural change due to their wetting nature, resulting in strong surface forces. This exploratory study demonstrates how an ash fusion furnace can be utilised to investigate surface forces driving high temperature melt driven agglomeration. Wetting and reshaping of pressed analogue <b>sinter</b> <b>mix</b> tablets, with compositions that reflect melt forming regions in the sinter bed, were observed on alumina tiles as they were heated. <b>Sinter</b> <b>mix</b> tablets were then suspended in different configurations adjacent to pressed hematite substrates.

50|$|The most {{practical}} sensor for measuring temperature change in titrating solutions {{has been found}} to be the thermistor. Thermistors are small solid state devices which exhibit relatively large changes in electrical resistance for small changes in temperature.

The thermistor is encapsulated in a suitable electrically insulating medium with satisfactory heat transfer characteristics and acceptable chemical resistance.

The thermistor is supported by suitable electronic circuitry to maximize sensitivity to minute changes in solution temperature. The circuitry in the Metrohm 859 Titrotherm thermometric titration interface moldule is capable of resolving temperature changes as low as 10−5 K.|$|R
40|$|With the {{formation}} of melt, {{the structure of a}} sintering bed transforms because of material coalescence. The drivers of coalescence were studied using two bench-scale techniques. Analogue sinter mixes of varying the basicity and gangue levels were taken to high temperatures using thermomechanical analysis (TMA) and in an ash fusion test (AFT). In TMA, the penetration of a piston into the <b>sinter</b> <b>mix</b> as melt was generated provided information on the deformation, shrinkage, densification and flow of the sample as a function of temperature. Projected sample shapes in the AFT were used to determine sample density and densification level. A computer model FactSage and reported equations were used to provide estimates of melt volume and viscosity. Trends indicated by the TMA and AFT results were similar and large changes in results were only obtained with significant melt generation. Differences in results between the samples could not always be explained because varying the composition of the <b>sinter</b> <b>mix</b> altered the porosity of the sample. Increasing sample porosity meant that the generated melts were not as connected and more work is required to achieve the same level of densification. On a sinter strand, coalescence occurs under a normal load and this effect is simulated in the TMA. However, the excessive flow of melt from the crucible and chemical reactions means that TMA results are unreliable at temperatures greater than 1300 °C. For this reason, the AFT is the preferred technique to understand the factors that cause material coalescence on a sinter strand...|$|E
40|$|Iron ore {{sintering}} is {{the most}} popular process used to produce a suitable feed for the blast furnace. With changing iron ore supplies and composition, steel mills have to continually adjust the blended ore mix composition to the sinter plant. To help decision making in this area, and also obtain increased understanding of the process to allow improvements in sintering operations, laboratory-scale sinter pot tests are conducted. The use of a pot for routine testing and for research is discussed. When used as a research tool, the experimental approach used to simulate a plant will have to be modified to facilitate the interpretation of results.

In this work, the effect of suction, coke addition and mix moisture on flame front speed was studied in a pilot-scale sinter pot and also using a recently developed theoretical model. Airflow through the bed has a large influence on flame front speed. It was found that increasing sintering airflow rate will lead to increased flame front speed, but the increases become smaller at higher airflow rates. Sinter pot test results showed that increasing coke addition decreased green bed permeability and increased flame front temperature, which resulted in increased flame front resistance and decreased flame front speed.

40|$|In {{iron ore}} sintering, the {{properties}} of the flame front are clearly critical as they determine the heat imparted to the particulate bed and, hence, the strength of the formed sinter. This study explores the factors that influence flame front temperature and also the speed at which it descends down a bed. These two properties are dependent on post-ignition airflow rate and {{the properties of}} the <b>sinter</b> <b>mix.</b> Post-ignition airflow rate is a strong function of the pre-ignition airflow rate and the flow resistance of the flame front. This study reiterates the strong dependence of flame front resistance on gas flow velocity, flame front temperature and applied suction. Dense ores produce higher bulk density and lower porosity beds and, as a consequence, they have the effect of slowing down and broadening the flame front. The influence of flame front speed on flame front properties for different ores was also established. For comparable flame front properties results show that sinter basicity has a large influence on sinter strength and yield. Studies of coke combustion efficiency show decreasing values with increasing flame front speed and values increased significantly when sintering YANDI ore. Many of the obtained quantitative dependences will be used to verify a sintering mathematical model that is under developmen...|$|E

Mass balance {{calculations}} after measurement of output samples (ESP dust, sinter product and stack emissions) revealed net reduction of PBDEs during sintering. After PBDD/Fs were detected in stack emissions, PBDEs and PBDD/Fs were investigated using a sinter pot (SP) - a laboratory scale version of the sintering process - under various conditions. Results suggested de novo synthesis of PBDD/Fs occurs within the process, but this was not caused by the PBDE content of RSM. The results from the SP ruled out PBDE formation within the sintering process. Measurement of PBDEs in UK air and soil demonstrated that whilst PBDEs appeared to have decreased since legislative use restrictions, their persistence is highlighted by their continued detection. PBDEs decreased in air and soil with distance from Birmingham City Centre, highlighting the higher density of PBDE sources in urban areas. Australian soils were less contaminated with PBDEs than the UK.

40|$|In an {{iron ore}} {{sintering}} bed, the combustion behaviour of coke particles together with {{velocity of the}} flowing gas stream determines the temperature, width and speed of the traversing flame front. A bed heat treatment mathematical model was formulated in an earlier study to describe this complex relationship. An area of improvement in the model is {{the description of the}} coke combustion process, which is highly dependent on the resistances controlling the flow of gases to and from the coke particles. These vary for different coke particles because of the prior coarsening of the <b>sinter</b> <b>mix</b> by granulation. The characteristic structure of granules – nuclear particle with an adhering fines layer – indicates that gases have better access to finer coke particles. In this study, an available granulation model is integrated into the heat treatment model to provide a novel description of coke positioning within granules. In addition to this change, two endothermic reactions were introduced into the model. Using the previous and modified models, predicted bed temperature–time profiles as a function of position down the bed, were compared against embedded thermocouples results from seventeen laboratory sinter tests. Generally, the modified definition of coke combustion behaviour resulted in improved comparison with experimental results. In the sintering literature, studies have been reported on: the use of charcoal/biomass char to replace coke, the preferential placement of coke particles on the outside of granules, and varying the size distribution of the coke particles. Improving the access of gases to coke particles and decreasing coke size are comparable to using more reactive fuels. Combustion rate, efficiency and flame front properties are all influenced by fuel reactivity. Model predictions of changes in bed temperatures, flame front properties and sintering performance caused by fuel type, location and size are consistent with reported observations...|$|E

40|$|Iron ore {{sintering}} blends in the Asia-Pacific contain significant {{levels of}} Australian ores which are lower in bulk density compared to Brazilian ores. This study explores {{the impact of}} further decreasing the bulk density of a fairly typical ore blend. This was done by introducing small amounts of a very porous ore into the blend. Measured decreases in bulk density were up to 3 %. All the sinter quality parameters could be maintained or improved without the need to increase coke rate. Changes in sinter density results were not significant, indicating that the changes in bed bulk density {{did not have a}} significant effect on sinter porosity. The study was then extended to include a comparable blend and two hematite blends of higher bulk density. Decreasing green bed bulk density, bed shrinkage and sinter density did not have a detrimental effect on sinter tumble strength. The associated increase in porosity with the measured changes in sinter density is estimated to be up to 10 %. Results showed that sinter density values obtained for the low bulk density mixes at increased coke addition were still lower than equivalent values for the hematite mixes. As expected flame front speed was dependent on post-ignition airflow rate and both these parameters influence sinter strength.

40|$|In a {{sintering}} bed {{the generation}} of melt in the descending flame front causes the coalescence of material and {{the transformation of the}} particulate bed. Interspersed between the large voids are the densified lumps of sinter which are released on crushing and used as blast furnace feed. The bed transformation process is critical in sintering and is an outcome of the work done on the material by the surface and opposing viscous forces. Less densified, weaker sinter forms when the level of coalescence achieved is low. The process is extremely complex in that it involves a three-phase melt–solids–gas system. In this study, the composition of the sinter bed was simulated using the pressed cylinders of laboratory grade chemicals and the coalescence process was studied by characterising the densification of the cylinders. The alumina, magnesia and basicity of the cylinders were altered (1 – 4 %, 0 – 2 % and 0 – 3, respectively) to change the properties of the melt and also its solid content. The estimation of solid–melt content, melt composition, viscosity and surface tension was obtained using a thermodynamic model (FactSage) and the reported equations in the literature. Using these results Laplace number of the system was determined as a function of temperature. At the completion of some tests the cooled solidified samples were studied under a microscope. The experimental results showed that the higher sinter density and densification factor were obtained when temperature and <b>sinter</b> <b>mix</b> basicity increased and alumina levels decreased. The effect of magnesia level on densification was less because the porosity of the cylinders altered with magnesium carbonate levels. The trends obtained in sinter densification are consistent with the micro-structural information indicated by optical micrographs. The use of Laplace number to quantify the relative influence of the surface to viscous forces on coalescence was encouraging with a prediction error within ± 10 %. It was also concluded that the most influential factor determining densification factor was the apparent viscosity of the molten mix as the change in surface force was comparatively small...|$|E
40|$|The sinter {{quality is}} {{dependent}} on sinter mineralogy, which in turn depends on the chemical compositions of the <b>sinter</b> <b>mix.</b> Although many research works have been conducted, further investigation {{on the effect of}} chemical compositions (MgO, A 2 O 3, Basicity) on the sinter quality is still required for further improvement of the sinter and more alternative additives are still being tested. In this project, a sinter pot has been used to manufacture sinters, which were characterized using point-counting to quantify the different phases and X-Ray diffraction to identify the polymorphic forms of Ca 2 SiO 4 of the silicate phases. The produced sinters were evaluated with respect to reducibility index (RI), reduction degradation index (RDI), physical breakdown (TI and AI), and production properties (yield, coke breeze rate and production rate). The influence of ignition temperature, magnesium oxide, alumina addition and basicity on the mineralogy as well as physical and chemical properties of iron ore sinters were investigated. Results were obtained as follows: For the Base case with a basicity of 2, 2. 8 mass% MgO content, 1. 7 mass % Al 2 O 3 and 10 mass% CaO, the effect of ignition temperature, which ranged between 864 oC and 1100 oC, on the sinter quality was investigated. Results showed that the ignition temperature had an effect on the sinter properties: reducibility (RI), physical strength (TI and AI), production properties (yield, coke breeze rate and production rate). The temperature 1053 oC was the best ignition temperature for an economically acceptable sinter. A further increase in ignition temperature was found to form melt {{on the surface of the}} sinter produced, leading to a sinter of low quality. Also, X-rays diffraction pattern showed that the allotropic transformation of the Ca 2 SiO 4 did not take place. The Low SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter had the highest reducibility index and had the highest Abrasion index and the lowest coke breeze rate at 2. 8 mass% MgO content compared to all the sinters produced in this project. For the High SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter MgO was added through dolomite and fused magnesia. A comparative study on the effect of dolomite and fused magnesia was conducted. The sinter to which fused magnesia was added had lower reducibility, higher reduction degradation, higher tumble index, lower abrasion index and lower coke breeze rate than the sinter to which dolomite was added. High SiO 2 – High Al 2 O 3 sinter had the lowest reducibility index, the lowest reduction degradation, the lowest tumbler index and the highest coke breeze rate. The increase in MgO content in all the sinters produced increased the coke breeze rate. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{replacing}} fine ore by coarse ore on sintering reactions was investigated using an infrared furnace on laboratory scale and sinter pots on pilot plant scale. Five sinter mixes were prepared {{by changing the}} percentage coarse ore from 0 % to 100 % in 25 % increments. Coarse ore fraction, sintering temperature, holding time and oxygen partial pressure were selected as sintering parameters, and two-level factorial design was used for identification of parameters that significantly influence the formation of sinter phases. Experimental {{results showed that the}} coarse ore fraction has a higher effect on the sintering process compared to those of other parameters. The experiment design also enabled to set these parameters to their optimum values. The porosity of compacted pellets was measured using a helium pycnometer. The replacement of fine ore by coarse ore resulted in a decrease in porosity (increase in packing density) of compacted pellets. The particles are closer to each other in pellets consisting of more coarse particles than fine particles. Laboratory experiments were performed at 1300 °C in air, using a high heating rate (15 °C/s). The holding time was set to 2. 5 minutes. X-ray diffraction (XRD), reflected light microscopy (RLM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) were used to characterize sintering reactions and sinter phases. XRD analysis revealed that sintered pellets consisted of hematite, SFCA, SFCA-I and calcium silicate. The proportions of SFCA slightly increased when the fraction of coarse ore varied from 0 % to 25 %, but decreased with a further increase in percentage coarse ore. At 25 % coarse ore fraction, the porosity of the compacted pellets decreased, resulting in an increase in packing density and sintering rate. More hematite reacted, resulting in the formation of high amounts of SFCA. Above 25 % coarse ore fraction, the amount of hematite increased, and the concentrations of columnar SFCA decreased despite a further decrease in porosity. This was attributed to the decrease in reaction surface area for coarse ore, and the short reaction time, which limited the extent of reaction of the coarse particles. The variation of SFCA-I and calcium silicate was not significant under laboratory conditions. Reflected light microscopy and SEM analysis easily identified two major sinter phases: hematite and SFCA. A clear distinction between the different types of SFCA could not be made using EDS analysis. Sinter pot tests were carried out in order to examine the effect of coarse ore fraction on physical and metallurgical properties of sinters. The tumbler and reduction disintegration indexes increased with increasing coarse ore fraction in the sinter bed. This was presumably due to the increase in amounts of hematite and decrease in surface area for reaction. Consequently, the reducibility of sinter decreased as the percentage coarse ore increased. This study has concluded that the presence of 25 % coarse ore in the <b>sinter</b> <b>mix</b> led to enhance sintering reactions. The amounts of SFCA increased, and sinter quality was improved. It is recommended that in future work, sintering reactions should further be investigated by also measuring the permeability of the sinter bed and the reaction surface area of solid particles.

The effects of titania on the properties were studied for the reduced state as well as the oxidized state of the <b>sintered</b> <b>mixed</b> oxides. X-ray analysis showed that the materials were not always single phase.

The electrical conductivity increased with temperature at approximately 0. 1 mhos/cm at 1700 C for all compositions. The thermal expansion coefficient decreased with increasing titania as did the monoclinic to tetragonal transformation temperature. The fracture strength of the oxidized bars tended to decrease with the addition of titania owing to the presence of the second phase titania. The fracture strength of the reduced bars exhibited a minimum corresponding to a two-phase region of monoclinic and cubic phases.

40|$|AbstractRecently {{innovative}} {{solid state}} / ‘meltless’ recycling techniques {{have been developed}} and proposed for the consolidation of aluminium alloy scrap, aiming both at energy and material savings by eliminating the melting step. In this context, a powder metallurgy route is examined as a solid state recycling technique for the fabrication of a two-phase material via Spark Plasma <b>Sintering.</b> By <b>mixing</b> aluminium atomized powder and machining chips of the same alloy, a two-phase material was produced, where the powder phase acts as a binder/matrix for the Al scrap. Hardness, density, compression testing along with microstructural and computed tomography analysis of the densified Al 6061 alloy are presented...|$|R
40|$|High density ceramic sinters are {{manufactured}} by coating premolded or presintered porous ceramics with a sealing material of high SiO 2 porous glass or nitride glass and then sintering by hot isostatic pressing. The ceramics have excellent abrasion and corrosion resistances. Thus LC- 10 (Si 3 N 2 powder) and Y 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 type <b>sintering</b> were <b>mixed</b> and molded {{to give a}} premolded porous ceramic (porosity 37 %, relative bulk density 63 %). The ceramic was dipped in a slurry containing high SiO 2 porous glass and an alcohol solution of cellulose acetate and dried. The coated ceramic was treated {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} and then sintered by hot isostatic pressing to give a dense ceramic sinter...|$|R
50|$|A {{mixture of}} uranyl nitrate and {{plutonium}} nitrate in nitric acid is converted by treatment with a base such as ammonia {{to form a}} mixture of ammonium diuranate and plutonium hydroxide. After heating {{in a mixture of}} 5% hydrogen and 95% argon will form a mixture of uranium dioxide and plutonium dioxide. Using a base, the resulting powder can be run through a press and converted into green colored pellets. The green pellet can then be <b>sintered</b> into <b>mixed</b> uranium and plutonium oxide pellet. While this second type of fuel is more homogenous on the microscopic scale (scanning electron microscope) it is possible to see plutonium rich areas and plutonium poor areas. It can be helpful to think of the solid as being like a salami (more than one solid material present in the pellet).|$|R
