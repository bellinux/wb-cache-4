40|$|Advanced {{steps of}} tumor {{progression}} are generally {{characterized by an}} increased growth fraction within the neoplastic cell population. The presence of a relevant growth fraction is also related to widely accepted prognostic parameters in some human malignancies. Our aims were to evaluate {{the presence of a}} growth fraction with Ki 67 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), and to correlate it with tumor progression and HLA-DR antigen expression in 88 melanocytic lesions. The lesions were 19 acquired melanocytic nevi, 58 primary melanomas [divided into 26 <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas</b> (SSM), 24 <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas</b> with nodular areas (SS + NM), and five nodular melanomas (NM) ], and 11 metastases from malignant melanomas. Ki 67 MoAb stained 16 %, 19 %, 71 %, 100 %, and 82 % of nevi, SSM, SS + NM, NM, and metastases, respectively. Among primary melanomas, Ki 67 MoAb stained 12 %, 28 %, 50 %, and 70 % of tumors < 0. 75, 0. 75 - 1. 49, 1. 5 - 2. 9, and ≥ 3 mm thick, respectively. A concordant reactivity pattern for Ki 67 and HLA-DR antigens was found in 72 % of lesions (p < 0. 000 1). We have shown that a representative growth fraction (ie, Ki 67 reactivity) is present in melanocytic lesions only in advanced steps of tumor progression and correlates with HLA-DR antigen expression. Despite the different biologic values of Ki 67 and HLA-DR antigens, we suggest the joint evaluation of both antigens as a useful marker of aggressive behavior in melanoma...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cutaneous {{melanoma}} is {{a highly}} aggressive malignancy with increasing incidence worldwide. The southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina {{has one of the}} highest incidence rates of melanoma in the country. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiological profile of melanoma patients in a southern city of Brazil. METHODS: a cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted, aiming to detect the clinical and histopathological characteristics of cutaneous melanoma diagnosed in the city of Brusque - SC, between 1999 and 2013. RESULTS: A total of 213 cases in 212 individuals were studied. More than 50 % of the patients were females (p< 0. 05). The trunk was the most commonly affected site (p< 0. 05), followed by the upper limbs. Nodular and <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas</b> were the most commonly detected in histological analyses. They did not differ statistically in frequency, but were more prevalent than other histopathological subtypes (p< 0. 05). There was no statistically significant difference between invasive and noninvasive melanomas (p= 0. 2441). Among the invasive melanomas, those with Breslow thicknesses < 1 mm and between 1 - 2 mm were more prevalent (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found a higher frequency of melanomas in female patients and patients aged over 51. The trunk was the most commonly affected site. Nodular and <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas</b> prevailed. Among invasive melanomas, those with Breslow thicknesses < 2 mm were the most frequent.

40|$|Diagnosis of <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanoma</b> in {{the early}} stage is often difficult, even with dermoscopy. We report {{the case of a}} 37 -year-old Japanese woman with <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanoma</b> in her left buttock. The lesion {{developed}} 20 years before becoming visible and gradually enlarged {{over the past few years}} without any symptoms. Physical examination showed a well-demarcated dark-brown macule 10 mm in diameter. Dermoscopy demonstrated a central dark area with a blue-grey structureless area, a milky-red area with irregular blue-grey dots or globules suggestive of regression structures, and multifocal black pigmentation with whitish scaly areas. An abrupt intralesional change in color from a central dark area to a peripheral light-brown area was also seen. The peripheral area showed an atypical pigment network with an obscure mesh and holes. Histopathologic examination of the lesion showed acanthosis with melanocytic proliferation and nuclear atypia, a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate, melanophages and a few nests of melanocytes just beneath the epidermis. The epidermal melanocytes were positive for S- 100, Melan-A and HMB- 45, but the dermal nests of melanocytes were negative for HMB- 45 and positive for S- 100 and Melan-A. A diagnosis of <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanoma</b> with a tumor thickness of 0. 4 mm (pT 1 aN 0 M 0, stage 1 A) was established based on the clinical, dermoscopic and histopathologic findings.

40|$|Using {{a silver}} {{staining}} technique, we studied nucleolar organizer regions (AgNOR) in paraffin sections of junctional nevi, compound nevi, intradermal nevi, blue nevi, dysplastic nevi, Spitz nevi, lentigo maligna, malignant <b>melanomas</b> in nevus, <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas,</b> and nodular melanomas. Two methods of counting black dots within nuclei were employed. One method was {{to count the}} discrete black dots within the nuclei, including the tiny black dots seen within the nucleolus; the second method did {{not take into account}} the subsidary cluster of tiny black dots seen within the nucleolus, instead treating these dots as a single structure. Whichever method we used, a significant difference was found between the pooled mean AgNOR numbers for benign and malignant lesions. We found an overlap, however, between benign, in particular Spitz and dysplastic nevi, and malignant lesions when considering individual counts of AgNOR using both methods.

40|$|Electron {{microscopic}} {{studies of}} 4 surgically excised human primary <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas</b> {{of the skin}} were done with special emphasis on the host inflammatory and vascular responses to tumor. Host cells participating in the inflammatory response included numerous small lymphocytes, activated macrophages, and mast cells. Some mast cells had lost local portion of granule content, but complete degranulation of mast cells was not seen. Activated macrophages had avidly ingested melanin granules and cellular debris and often were close to dying tumor cells. Lymphocytes, many displaying motile forms, were actively invading the epidermis; formed perivascular cuffs around damaged vessels; and were in intimate contact with living, damaged, and dead melanoma cells. Basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils were absent from inflammatory infiltrates. Changes of the microvasculature included focal endothelial necrosis and hypertrophy as well as basal lamina changes indicative of repeated episodes of endothelial injury, necrosis and regeneration. These findings are discussed in relationship {{to a number of}} recent studies of the immunologically-mediated inflammatory responses to contact allergy, graft rejection, and syngeneic tumor rejection, in man and animals...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prognostic}} {{significance of}} spontaneous regression in melanoma, especially thin lesions, {{has been a}} controversial issue for the past 20 years, although recent studies suggest that extensive and late regression {{may be related to}} worse prognosis. Many data suggest that lymphangiogenesis predicts metastatic <b>spread</b> in <b>melanoma.</b> Methods: We have quantified lymphatic microvascular density (LMVD) in thin (<= 1. 0 mm) <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas</b> comparing regressive and nonregressive melanomas, regressive and nonregressive areas from the same tumor, and early and late histological stages of regression in the same tumor. In addition, we tried to correlate lymphangiogenesis and tumor growth phase. We conducted histological examinations and immunohistochemical analyses using monoclonal antibody D 2 - 40 with subsequent quantification by image analysis of 37 melanomas, 16 regressive and 21 nonregressive (controls). Results: We found higher LMVD in the late stage of regression compared with nonregressive area (internal control) of regressive melanomas. Conclusions: Our study suggest that the late stage of spontaneous regression in thin melanomas may be related to worse prognosis as it showed higher LMVD, and evidence shows that this is related with increased risk of metastatic spread. But this supposition must be confirmed by a longer follow-up for detection of lymph node metastases...|$|R

40|$|The {{two major}} {{melanoma}} histologic subtypes, superficial spreading and nodular melanomas, {{differ in their}} speed of dermal invasion but converge biologically once they invade and metastasize. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that distinct molecular alterations arising in primary melanoma cells might persist as these tumors progress to invasion and metastasis. Ribosomal protein S 6 kinase, 90 kDa, polypeptide 1 (RSK 1; official name RPS 6 KA 1) was significantly hyperactivated in human melanoma lines and metastatic tissues derived from nodular compared with <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanoma.</b> RSK 1 was constitutively phosphorylated at Ser- 380 in nodular but not <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanoma</b> and did not directly correlate with BRAF or MEK activation. Nodular melanoma cells were more sensitive to RSK 1 inhibition using siRNA and the pharmacological inhibitor BI-D 1870 compared with superficial spreading cells. Gene expression microarray analyses revealed that RSK 1 orchestrated a program of gene expression that promoted cell motility and invasion. Differential overexpression of the prometastatic matrix metalloproteinase 8 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 in metastatic nodular compared with metastatic <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanoma</b> was observed. Finally, using an in vivo zebrafish model, constitutive RSK 1 activation increased melanoma invasion. Together, these data reveal a novel role for activated RSK 1 in the progression of nodular melanoma and suggest that melanoma originating from different histologic subtypes may be biologically distinct and that these differences are maintained as the tumors invade and metastasize...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{predominance}} of melanomas {{on the left}} side of the body has recently been described. No associations between tumour laterality and gender, age or anatomical site have been identified. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of left-sided melanomas in an Irish population and to examine potential associations with various patient and tumour characteristics. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with cutaneous melanoma who were treated over a 10 -year period was carried out. Lateral distribution of melanoma on either side of the body was compared using chi(2) analysis and evaluated by gender, age group, anatomic location, histologic subtype and Breslow depth. RESULTS: More melanomas occurred {{on the left side}} (57 %, P = 0. 015), and this finding was particularly significant in females. For both genders combined, there were no statistically significant differences in laterality by age group, anatomic location, type of melanoma and Breslow depth. There were significantly more <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas</b> on the left side in both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a {{predominance of}} left-sided melanomas in Irish patients.

40|$|Immunohistochemical {{analysis}} of {{the expression of the}} cyclin kinase inhibitor p 21 WAF 1 /CIP 1 in a panel of primary and metastatic human melanocytic tumors was performed. It was found that, independent of the p 53 status, approximately 30 % of the primary melanomas and 40 % of the metastases completely lacked expression of this cell cycle inhibitor. Some tumors were also analyzed by Northern blotting, and in most of the cases a consistant correlation between mRNA and protein expression was observed. In four benign nevi studied, WAF 1 /CIP 1 mRNA was expressed whereas the protein was not detected, suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation of the inhibitor in these cases. In <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas,</b> a significant correlation between protein expression and tumor thickness was found, with thin lesions showing low protein levels. Interestingly, by comparing primary and metastatic specimens obtained from the same patient, a reduction in p 21 WAF 1 /CIP 1 antibody staining was observed in the latter, probably reflecting a more aggressive phenotype of the metastases. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the complexity in the relationship between p 21 WAF 1 /CIP 1 expression and tumor phenotype and furthermore suggest that aberrant expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor may be of importance in the development and progression of sporadic malignant melanoma...|$|R
40|$|Mutations {{in the p}} 53 tumor {{suppressor}} gene, {{located at}} chromosomal locus 17 pI 3, are the most commonly seen genetic alterations found in human malignancies. Their role in the pathogenesis of malignant melanoma {{is thought to be}} limited, although variable results have been reported in reference to immunoreactivity for putatively mutant p 53 protein (mp 53) in melanocytic lesions in general. In that light, the au-thors undertook an immunohistologic evaluation of 256 well-characterized tumors in that category, including common nevi (CN; n= 73); Spitz nevi (SN; n= 40); nodular melanomas (NMMs; n= 32), <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas</b> (SMMs; n= 65); lentigo maligna melanomas (LMMs; n= 23); and melanomas arising in preexisting nevi (MANs; n= 23). One hundred cells were counted manually in randomly selected high-power microscopic fields, in regard to nuclear labeling for mp 53. Results were recorded semiquantitatively, as negative, positive (1 - 4 % of tumor cells); and positive (> 5 % of tumor cells). No examples of CN or SN demonstrated any immunoreactivity whatever for mp 53, whereas 105 of 143 melanomas (73 %) did so. However, an mp 53 index of> 50 % was seen in only 29 % of the latter lesions.

40|$|While {{mutations}} of CDKN 2 A {{are associated}} with melanoma predisposition, the precise role of its gene product p 16 {{in the development of}} sporadic melanoma is less clearly understood. We sought to determine the prevalence of p 16 expression using immunohistochemical analysis in a population-based sample of melanoma tumours, and also to identify histological, phenotypic and environmental factors associated with {{the presence or absence of}} p 16 expression. We conducted face-to-face interviews with 108 patients newly diagnosed with melanoma to ascertain their history of sun exposure, and recorded various phenotypic parameters. Paraffin sections of tumours from these patients were stained with an anti-p 16 monoclonal antibody following antigen retrieval. Overall, 52 (48 %) tumours expressed p 16; nodular melanomas had significantly lower levels of p 16 immunoreactivity than <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas</b> (P = 0. 015). While no association was found between p 16 expression and host phenotype, loss of p 16 staining was associated with thicker lesions (p = 0. 084) and a high mitotic index (P = 0. 013). Taken together, these findings are consistent with loss of p 16 being a late event in the progression of sporadic primary melanomas, being associated with tumours of a more aggressive nature.

There were 31 males and 91 females. All primary lesions were retrospectively microstaged by Clark's levels and Breslow's thickness criteria {{by one of}} the senior authors. Morphologically, 71 % were <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas</b> (SSM), 16. 5 % were nodular melanomas (NM), and 11. 9 % were acral lentiginous melanomas.

Twenty-three patients (18. 8 %) recurred and of these, 15 died of their disease. This included six of the seven patients with histologically positive lymph nodes. Complications were not only acceptable but preventable and will be discussed. Microstaging provides a valid basis by which to compare treatment regimens and, more importantly, a valid criteria by which to select treatment for a given patient. These data compare favorably with other reported series. At the time these studies were initiated, five-year survivals for clinically Stage I and II melanoma were roughly 55 % and 15 %, respectively.

40|$|Cancerous {{inhibitor}} {{of protein}} phosphatase 2 A (CIP 2 A) {{is an important}} onco-gene contributing to cancer progression partially by regulating cMYC and AKT. We examined CIP 2 A expression in cutaneous melanomas, its association with clinicopathological parameters and mapped molecular mechanisms regulated by CIP 2 A in vitro. CIP 2 A expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 17 nevi, 132 primary melanomas and 49 metastases. Effects of siRNA-mediated down-regulation on proliferation, apoptosis and signaling pathways were assessed in melanoma cell lines. In <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas</b> (SSM), high nuclear CIP 2 A expression was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (P = 0. 0018). Surprisingly, high cytoplasmic expression was related to improved relapse-free (P = 0. 031) and OS (P = 0. 014) in nodular melanomas (NM). In vitro experiments revealed that CIP 2 A can regulate proliferation and/or apopto-sis partially through the PI 3 K/AKT pathway but also independently. In sum-mary, CIP 2 A could represent a potential therapeutic target in SSM. However, in NM cytoplasmic CIP 2 A is associated with improved prognosis indicating that CIP 2 A has distinct, complex functions dependent on the molecular context and histological subtype. As seen in other cancer types, CIP 2 A can influence cMYC and AKT, but our data also suggest that in melanoma it has additional targets which need to be identified...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) is {{the most}} common {{hereditary}} neurocutaneous disorder and it is associated with an elevated risk for malignant tumors of tissues derived from neural crest cells. The NF 1 gene is considered a tumor suppressor gene and inactivation of both copies can be found in NF 1 -associated benign and malignant tumors. Melanocytes also derive from neural crest cells but melanoma incidence is not markedly elevated in NF 1. In this study we could analyze a typical <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanoma</b> of a 15 -year-old boy with NF 1 for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) within the NF 1 gene. Neurofibromatosis in this patient was transmitted by the boy's farther who carried the mutation NF 1 c. 5546 G/A. Results Melanoma cells were isolated from formalin-fixed tissue by liquid coverslip laser microdissection. In order to obtain statistically significant LOH data, digital PCR was performed at the intragenic microsatellite IVS 27 AC 28 with DNA of approx. 3500 melanoma cells. Digital PCR detected 23 paternal alleles and one maternal allele. Statistical analysis by SPRT confirmed significance of the maternal allele loss. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first molecular evidence of inactivation of both copies of the NF 1 gene in a typical <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanoma</b> of a patient with NF 1. The classical double-hit inactivation of the NF 1 gene suggests that the NF 1 genetic background promoted melanoma genesis in this patient. </p...|$|E
40|$|Human {{pituitary}} tumour-transforming gene 1 or hPTTG 1 is a proto-oncogene that {{codes for}} securin, a protein involved in sister chromatid separation. Based on previous microarray data, we studied {{the expression of}} hPTTG 1 /securin in melanocytic lesions. In contrast to nevi and radial growth phase melanomas, securin was expressed by scattered cells in the vertical growth phase, suggesting a role in tumour progression. In a series of 29 nodular and 29 <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas,</b> matched for all histological prognostic parameters, securin expression was significantly correlated with the nodular subtype (P= 0. 018) and not related to thickness. In other cancers, hPTTG 1 is involved in various oncogenic pathways, including induction of neovascularisation and aneuploidy, and inhibition of p 53 activity. We found coexpression of securin with wild-type p 53 in the same neoplastic cells in a minority of melanomas. Expression of securin was significantly correlated with the extent of aneuploidy but not with {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} immunoreactivity or microvessel density. DNA cytometry revealed that nuclei-overexpressing securin frequently showed tetraploidy or aneuploidy. Our data show that hPTTG 1 is frequently overexpressed in nodular melanoma, and suggest that hPTTG 1 may act as an oncogene in the vertical growth phase, either by inhibiting anaphase, thereby causing aneuploidy and genomic instability, or by modulating the function of p 53, thereby impairing apoptosis. status: publishe...|$|R

In this population-based study of 279 HNMs diagnosed in a French region between 2004 and 2009, major {{differences were found between}} genders. A clearcut, sex-related distribution was found between a “peripheral” area (scalp, forehead, temples, ears, and neck) and a “central” one (other parts of the face), with 56. 7 % of HNMs being located in the peripheral area in men and 79. 3 % in the central area in women (P< 0. 0001). Moreover, HNMs located in the peripheral area occurred on the left side in 57. 6 % of men and on the right side in 73. 1 % of women (P= 0. 009). Peripheral HNMs differed from central HNMs by a higher proportion of invasive tumors, nodular or <b>superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas,</b> and a lower proportion of lentigo maligna melanomas (LMMs). We hypothesized that this differential distribution between men and women could be explained mostly by a major role of long-term photoprotection by hair and sun exposure in a car.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} melanoma {{in the general}} population during the last few decades has provoked a great deal of research, aiming to identify the possible relationship between old and new etiological factors involved in the pathogenesis of this tumor The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the incidence of melanoma in central Greece, especially in the prefecture of Larissa from January 1988 to December 1998. Data were collected from the General Hospital of Larissa. Seventy-one cases of melanoma were studied (41 females, 30 males). The incidence increased from 1. 36 / 100, 000 patients during the first year of the study (1988) to 5. 2 / 100, 000 patients in the last year of the study (1998). The patients' skin types were: type 12. 8 %, type II 52. 1 %, type III 45. 1 %. The median age of patients was 61. 9 years, 61. 4 years in female and 62. 5 years in male patients. Concerning their occupation, farmers accounted for 56. 3 %. Melanomas were most frequently located on head and neck (36. 6 %), extremities (30. 98 %) and trunk (11. 3 %). <b>Superficial</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>melanomas</b> were observed in 44 % of the patients and nodular melanomas in 20 %. In conclusion, there was a rapid increase in the incidence of melanoma in our region especially during the last 3 years...|$|R
