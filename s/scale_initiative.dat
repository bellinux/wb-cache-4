They are examples collected by ReCivitas itself and confirmed in field analysis and by the independent study of Mathias Rudolph, which prove the bonding capacity of BIG and its capacity of becoming and a safety net for those involved. The certainty of BIG, regardless of the family’s socioeconomic status or of the ability to comply with conditions allowed those involved to develop and implement plans. There are cases such as the mother who was able to set BIG aside for the development and growth of her small daughter, without compromising the household expenses. Such as the two young men who were able to buy a motorbike together to move around between the farms where they work. The example of the woman who discovered she had chronic health problems and was {{able to go to the}} doctor and buy medicines for her monthly treatment. The mother who could save her son from pneumonia, with the purchase of medicines. The mother who buys her medicine in installments from the city pharmacist, who knows about her right and about the certainty of the BIG, in the same way as the local grocery owner. The families who were able to feed their children with meat and fruit, to give them school supplies, clothing. The mothers who had better pregnancies with babies born without malnutrition, which used to be so frequent. The child who can read today for 15 having glasses. The families who built their houses, vegetable gardens, cages, chicken coops. Who paid their debts with banks. The difference, therefore, between a conditioned program and the unconditional citizen's income goes far beyond normative structures or different theoretical conditions. The non-conditionality allows a result that was not only not reached by a program with conditions, but even prejudiced." ...|$|E

ICT-EARTH approaches the energy-efficiency problem holistically [15], where all aspects and elements, i.e. social impact, energy efficiency metrics, green network management mechanism, components and green radio transmission aspects, are joined into a common integrated platform [63]. An important contribution of this project is the E 3 F framework [21] where the network modelling (traffic behaviour, BS energy model, deployment structure, etc.), the necessary energy-efficiency performance metrics, the energy-aware RRM techniques which can be applied, the network architecture and extension devices (e.g. femtoBS and relays) are blocks that constitute such approach.|$|E

40|$|International audienceHigh-throughput {{next-generation}} sequencing such as whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing are being rapidly integrated into clinical practice. The {{use of these}} techniques leads to the identification of secondary variants for which decisions about the reporting or not to the patient need to be made. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recently published recommendations for the reporting of these variants in clinical practice for 56 "actionable" genes. Among these, seven are involved in Marfan Syndrome And Related Disorders (MSARD) resulting from mutations of the FBN 1, TGFBR 1 and 2, ACTA 2, SMAD 3, MYH 11 and MYLK genes. Here, we show that mutations collected in UMD databases for MSARD genes (UMD-MSARD) are rarely reported, including the most frequent ones, in global <b>scale</b> <b>initiatives</b> for variant annotation such as the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), and ClinVar.

UMD-MSARD databases are therefore the only resources providing access to {{the full spectrum of}} known pathogenic mutations.

Both initiatives have faced significant challenges in reaching their connection goals but have availed of opportunities, such as different strategies of multi-level and multi-stakeholder collaboration and partnership to advance their agendas. A virtuous cycle is recognized in relation to the positive feedback generated by sustained network expansion over time. It is hoped that the insights offered from this thesis may offer guidance to inform the development of similar projects elsewhere, particularly in less developed countries...|$|R

We present a multiscale model of angiogenesis that heralds the start of a large <b>scale</b> <b>initiative</b> to integrate related biological models. The goal of the integrative project is to better understand underlying biological mechanisms from the molecular level up through the organ systems level, and test new therapeutic strategies. Model methodology includes ordinary and partial differential equations, stochastic models, complex logical rules, and agent-based architectures. Current modules represent blood flow, oxygen transport, growth factor distribution and signaling, cell sensing, cell movement and cell proliferation. Challenges of integration lie in connecting modules that are diversely designed, seamlessly coordinating feedback, and representing spatial and time scales from ligand-receptor interactions and intracellular signaling, to celllevel movement and cell-matrix interactions, to vessel branching and capillary network formation, to tissue level characteristics, to organ system response. We briefly introduce the individual modules, discuss our approach to integration, present initial results from the coordination of modules, and propose solutions to some critical issues facing angiogenesis multiscale modeling and integration...|$|E
40|$|This paper summarises the {{findings}} of a review of policy and strategy documents published circa 2008 by a diverse set of eleven development partners in the rural water sector.

Based on the reviewed documents, the policies of the development partners included in this analysis demonstrate a clear commitment towards a number of important elements believed to be necessary for sustainable service delivery including learning and adaptive management, coordination and collaboration, capacity support for local government, and harmonisation and alignment. However, the analysis of the policy documents results in low scores for planning for asset management (i. e. renewals) and recognition and promotion of alternative service delivery options to community management (e. g. self- supply of, or delegated management to, the private sector). Thus, this study indicates that these areas, considered by Triple-S to be crucial for improving sustainability, are relatively neglected and merit more attention in the policies of organisations...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} 2014 Helsinki {{planning}} department {{published the}} draft of their new general plan. It includes an initiative to convert several of its major roads from expressways to urban boulevards, in order to utilize this central land for development of housing and workplaces. Such a large <b>scale</b> <b>initiative</b> is bound to result in much accumulated experience and knowledge about this topic which other cities could learn from. In Stockholm projects to utilize land along roads has occurred but none has yet been at the scale of motorways. Considering the extreme housing shortage in the region it can be assumed {{that there would be}} an interest in Stockholm to learn from experiences in Helsinki. However, planning experiences can often be quite case specific; not always translatable from one project to another. Different cities will have different conditions. The main objective of this research is therefore to investigate the similarities and differences in the conditions for boulevardisation in Stockholm and Helsinki. Factors considered are laws, regional and national regulations, political and public opinion and physical circumstances such as structure of development and transport networks. The investigation is done through examinations of plan documents, statistics and through case studies of three projects. One of the projects is the boulevardisation project of Helsinki. The other two cases are projects in two different municipalities of Stockholm county in which the possibilities for conversion have been investigated by planners. The conclusions present several similarities and differences between conditions for boulevardisation in Stockholm and Helsinki. Some of the differences are favorable to Stockholm and some to Helsinki. Some of the conclusions suggest the need for the county to have a larger role in a boulevardisation project on a similar scale as the one in Helsinki...|$|E

40|$|The rural {{development}} policy community is calling for new transdisciplinary approaches to convey meaningful measures (e. g. indicator sets, indices) for assessing High Nature Value farming systems at different spatial scales (IEEP, 2009). At broader spatial scales there has been huge efforts for example by IRENA (Indicator Reporting on the Integration of Environmental Concerns into Agriculture Policy) in developing a set of agri-environmental indicators at the European scale (Paracchini et al., 2010). Another European <b>scale</b> <b>initiative</b> was the High Nature Value farming project which worked on developing High Nature Value Farming area indicators. In parallel, there is a rich literature reporting local case study data on {{high nature value farming}} systems throughout Europe. Nevertheless, transforming the local case study data on a local level indicator set is yet far from being accomplished. Furthermore, is still missing cross scale work on integrating European and local scale high nature value farming indicators. Land cover patterns, being dynamic landscape components, are essential features in High nature value systems. Thus, one promising avenue for devising indicators that bridge the agri-environmental and social spheres at different scales of analysis is that of land cover (vegetation structures such as grass, glades and forests) (Wiggering et al., 2006). However, landscape structure and composition will alter with changes in scale, and also across regions throughout Europe, and land cover patterns will also shift accordingly. Therefore, {{it is likely that the}} metrics/indexes framed at the European scale will not be transferable across scales in a straightforward way. There is thus the need to explore what are the set of indicators(including but not exclusively land cover) that can be framed in a comprehensive methodological approach for upscaling and downscaling HNV farming indicators (EEA, 2010). This paper particularly focuses on methodological issues in the light of the state of the art methodological approaches. It finishes by pointing out the challenges ahead for progressing on the development of multi scale indicators for gauging High Nature farming systems in Europ...|$|E
