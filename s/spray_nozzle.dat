25|$|Hair spray is {{a beauty}} aqueous {{solution}} {{that is used}} to keep hair stiff or in a certain style. Weaker than hair gel, hair wax, or glue, it is sprayed to hold styles for a long period. Using a pump or aerosol <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle,</b> it sprays evenly over the hair. Hair spray was first invented and manufactured in 1948 by Chase Products Company, based in Broadview, Illinois.|$|E

The <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> swung {{back and forth to}} cover a width of [...] Approximately 67 were built in 193839. On 15 April 1942 the Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres - OKH) ordered the tanks on the 65 vehicles in storage dismounted, the spray system disabled and the vehicles modified to carry 216 rounds of anti-tank ammunition. The vehicles were to be issued to rebuilding Nebeltruppen units. By this stage of the war they were equipped with Nebelwerfer rocket launchers and had organic anti-tank guns.|$|E
2500|$|Military carburetors {{may have}} [...] an anti-detonation {{injection}} (ADI) system. [...] This {{consists of a}} [...] "derichment valve" [...] located in the fuel control portion, a storage tank for the ADI fluid, a pump, a regulator that provides a specific amount of ADI fluid based on the fuel flow, and a <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> that is mounted in the air stream entering the supercharger.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> can be {{categorized}} based on the energy input used to cause atomization, {{the breakup of the}} fluid into drops. [...] <b>Spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> can have one or more outlets; a multiple outlet nozzle is known as a compound nozzle.|$|R
40|$|Used {{residual}} <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles,</b> {{which have}} been discarded because {{of the increase in}} discharge rates, may be used again if their discharge rates are reduced by a metering orifice placed in the nozzle tip. A suitable orifice in a polyethylene disc is described. On the basis of laboratory test results, such a disc appears to be an inexpensive and satisfactory metering device for use in combination with worn <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles...</b>|$|R
50|$|Limestone slurry is {{sprayed with}} single fluid <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> to control acid gas {{emissions}} especially sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from {{coal-fired power plants}} with liquid scrubbers. Calcium hydroxide (lime) is atomized into a spray dryer absorber to remove acid gases (SO2 and HCl) from coal-fired power plants. Water is sprayed to remove particulate solids using a spray tower or a cyclonic spray scrubber Cooling towers use <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> to distribute water.|$|R
2500|$|A floatless {{pressure}} carburetor {{is a type}} {{of aircraft}} fuel control that provides very accurate fuel delivery, prevents ice from forming in the carburetor and prevents fuel starvation during negative [...] "G" [...] and inverted flight by eliminating the customary float-controlled fuel inlet valve. [...] Unlike the float-type carburetor fuel system that relies on venturi suction to draw fuel into the engine, a pressure carburetor only uses the venturi to measure the mass airflow into the engine and manages the flow of fuel that is continuously under pressure from the fuel pump to the <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle.</b> In 1936, the first Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburetor (a model PD12-B) was installed and flown on an Allison V-1710-7.|$|E
2500|$|Daimler and Maybach {{continued}} to work together. They built a four-cylinder engine with Maybach' <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> carburetor. It {{was in the first}} organized automobile race, the [...] "Paris to Rouen" [...] and defeated all the entries from DMG. This caused DMG stock to fall. Frederick Simms, a major investor from Britain insisted that Daimler be brought back into the company. British investor industrialist Frederick Simms was so embarrassed that Daimler and Maybach's car had beaten the DMG entries that he made it a condition of his 350,000 mark purchase of a Phoenix engine license, which would stabilize the corporation's finances, that Daimler, now aged sixty, should return to DMG. Gottlieb Daimler received 200,000 goldmarks in shares, plus a 100,000 bonus. Simms received the right to use the name [...] "Daimler" [...] as his brand name for the engines. In 1895, the year DMG assembled its 1,000th engine, Maybach returned as chief engineer, receiving 30,000 shares.|$|E
2500|$|Aqueous {{film-forming}} foam (AFFF), used on A and B {{fires and}} for vapor suppression. The {{most common type}} in portable foam extinguishers. [...] AFFF {{was developed in the}} 1960s under Project Light Water in a joint venture between 3M and the U.S. Navy. AFFF forms a film that floats out before the foam blanket, sealing the surface and smothering the fire by excluding oxygen. AFFF is widely used for ARFF firefighting at airports, often as a twin agent unit (TAU) with purple-K dry chemical.It contains fluoro-tensides [...] which can be accumulated in the human body. The long-term effects of this on the human body and environment are unclear at this time. AFFF can be discharged through an air-aspirating branchpipe nozzle or a <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle,</b> and is now produced only in pre-mix form, where the foam concentrate is stored mixed with water. In the past, as solid charge model was produced, where the AFFF concentrate was housed as a dry compound in an external, disposable cartridge in a specially designed nozzle. The extinguisher body was charged with plain water, and the discharge pressure mixed the foam concentrate with the water upon squeezing the lever. These extinguishers received double the rating of a pre-mix model (40-B instead of 20-B), but are now considered obsolete, as parts and refill cartridges have been discontinued by the manufacturer.|$|E

50|$|The {{method of}} liquid {{injection}} at the venturi throat {{can also cause}} problems. <b>Spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> are used for liquid distribution {{because they are more}} efficient (have a more effective spray pattern) for liquid injection than weirs. However, <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> can easily plug when liquid is recirculated. Automatic or manual reamers can be used to correct this problem. However, when heavy liquid slurries (either viscous or particle-loaded) are recirculated, open-wear injection is often necessary.|$|R

50|$|A <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> is a {{precision}} device that facilitates dispersion of liquid into a spray.

40|$|According to EU Directive 2009 / 128 /EC {{pesticide}} application equipment must function reliably and be {{used properly}} for its intended purpose ensuring that pesticides can be accurately dosed and distributed. The transverse distribution of the spray mixture in the target area must be even, where relevant. Spray jets of double flat <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> are angled forward and backward. Depending {{on the design of}} the sprayer and boom height, parts of the equipment get splashed by the angled spray jet. Problems arise with lift masts which are fitted very close to the frame of the sprayer. Solutions might be technical modifications of the boom and tube. If technical changes are not possible, the use of flat <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> on the boom is recommended in the critical area in combination with double flat <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Results from sprayer inspection are shown with regard to cross distribution. Oftentimes, the deepness of the scanner patternator is not suitable in order to catch both spray jets of double flat <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles.</b> An upgrade for Herbst scanner patternator SPRAYERTEST 1000 is available. A modified table HV 1000 -L with 2 m in depth, which is double of the current one, is introduced to deal with that specific problem. An easy replacement of the patternator table in existing operating equipments is suggested...|$|R
