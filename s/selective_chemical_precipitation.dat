See DOI: 10. 1039 / c 4 gc 02246 gThe dissolution and subsequent selective recovery of elements from complex mixtures naturally necessitates redox chemistry. The majority of processes involve hydrometallurgical dissolution followed by <b>selective</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>precipitation</b> or electrochemical winning. The atom and energy efficiencies {{of these processes}} are poor, leading to a large volume of aqueous waste which needs to be treated before disposal. In this study it is demonstrated that electrocatalysis is an atom effective method of carrying out digestion and subsequently recovering elements from solution. Here deep eutectic solvents are used to simplify the speciation of solutes and to allow redox potentials to be modified compared to standard aqueous values. The redox catalyst used is iodine, as it demonstrates high solubility, fast electron transfer {{and the ability to}} oxidise most elements, including precious metals such as gold. The efficacy of this electrocatalyic method is demonstrated using three samples; Cu/Zn, Ga/As and Au/Ag/sulfidic ore. The authors thank the EPSRC and 5 NPlus for a studentship for JH.
