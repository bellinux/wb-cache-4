40|$|This study {{proposes a}} mixed integer dynamic capacitated {{intermodal}} facility location model that incorporates downside risk {{to determine a}} system level <b>strategic</b> intermodal <b>facility</b> <b>investment</b> plan in a region under uncertainty in freight commodity flow. Downside risk, which is associated here with the failure to achieve a desired target revenue for an intermodal facility (port or terminal), is incorporated in the model to capture {{the impact of the}} risk associated with the uncertainty in the commodity flow. The allowed system level downside risk is a parameter determined by the decision-maker, and a low value for it implies a lesser tolerance of risk. The downside risk analysis entails identifying the set of intermodal <b>facility</b> <b>investment</b> plans that represents tradeoffs between two objectives: expected system costs minimization and risk reduction associated with uncertainty in commodity flows. A scenario-based solution approach is used to characterize that uncertainty based on different estimates of future international trade and different emerging infrastructure projects that impact the commodity flows. Numerical experiments using the U. S. national level data demonstrate the potential applicability of the proposed model in assisting the <b>strategic</b> intermodal <b>facility</b> <b>investment</b> decision-making process. The downside risk analysis reveals that investing in intermodal terminals is preferable to investing in ports when low system level downside risk is allowed, and vice versa when high system level downside risk is allowed. The expected system costs increases with lower allowed system level downside risk because fewer investment plans for intermodal facilities are feasible under it, reducing the flexibility in commodity flow distribution. Also, the cost variance increases with lower allowed system level downside risk because commodity flows under different estimates of future international trade need to be allocated to the same capacity of intermodal facilities. The proposed methodology can provide a holistic view of the tradeoffs of <b>strategic</b> intermodal <b>investment</b> at the national level to aid policy development, and assist in the <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> decision-making process of individual facility operators by factoring commodity flow uncertainty. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} how oil price volatility affects the <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> decisions {{of a large}} panel of US firms. This paper uses key insights from the real options literature to develop {{a model of a}} company's <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> and shows how changes in oil price volatility can impact <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> decisions. The model is estimated using recently developed generalized method of moment estimation techniques for panel data sets. Empirical results are presented to show that there is a U shaped relationship between oil price volatility and firm investment. This is consistent with the predictions from the strategic growth options literature. The results should be useful to decision makers, investors, managers, policy makers and others who need to make <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> decisions in an uncertain world.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the foreign financial institutions ‟ spillover effects in China‟s banking sector through three channels, foreign <b>strategic</b> <b>investment,</b> employee turnover, and competition using qualitative analyses and quantitative analyses. Through comparing Chinese banks performance between pre- and post- foreign <b>strategic</b> <b>investment,</b> and the OLS regression analyses, {{we found that}} the foreign <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> did benefit Chinese banks, but the impact of <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> is not very obvious. Employee turnover gives Chinese banks opportunity to learn from foreign banks, but the employee mobility from Chinese banks to foreign banks benefit foreign banks more. Although Chinese banking sector is open to foreign banks, the growth of foreign banks in China is restricted, and the competition effects are not very obvious...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the timing and}} the valuation of <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> aimed at enhancing entry opportunities in related market segments. As demand is uncertain, entry options should be exercised at the optimal time, trading off the market share gain against the option to wait until more information is revealed, while anticipating competitors' entry behaviour. When the <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> grants a strong competitive advantage, the innovator can optimally choose the timing of entry; in case of weaker advantage, the investing firm enters just before its competitor would. In a context of increased uncertainty, the value of waiting to invest rises, but {{the value of a}} <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> increases even more. In some cases, <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> can act as a threat to discourage cross-entry, making parallel monopoly sustainable. entry; growth opportunities; real options; strategic investment; technological innovation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{crude oil}} price {{volatility}} plays {{an essential role}} for the oil companies when making a <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> decision. Different economic and political backgrounds could drive oil companies in North America, Asia, and Europe to make different <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> decision. Real options methodology is applied in analyzing the impact of oil price volatility on <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> of oil companies in the three regions. The empirical {{results show that the}} regional differences do exist, where the relationship between oil price volatility and oil companies' <b>strategic</b> <b>investment</b> in North America shows a reverse U shaped curve; meanwhile in Asia is exhibits a U shaped curve; while that in Europe shows a positive correlated linear relationship. These different regional results of oil price uncertainty could provide companies and governments essential information to make investment and policy decisions based on the according regions...|$|R

40|$|Project based capital {{investment}} planning {{for developing a}} railroad company's infrastructure facilities does not necessarily allow managers the optimal use of their limited capital resources, because such planning simply focuses on the required cash spending and expected return from the single project. A portfolio based investment strategy aims at increasing or maximizing {{the value of a}} company's set of ground facilities, i. e., infrastructure portfolio, through quantifying the impact of <b>strategic</b> <b>investments</b> on the value of a portfolio. This study makes two approaches to the measurement of the value of infrastructure portfolios and the effect of <b>strategic</b> <b>investments.</b> First, <b>strategic</b> <b>investments</b> are considered to add certain economic values to a company, which can be interpreted as residual returns from the portfolio after rewarding its investors.
