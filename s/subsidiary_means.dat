Furthermore, net loan sales are used to allow efficiency-enhancing specialization among bank subsidiaries, insofar as those subsidiaries with the best loan origination opportunities are able to focus on loan originations even if they do not have sufficient capital to hold the loans. Our evidence is consistent with banks affiliated with holding companies more actively participating in loan sales and purchases because, by using their internal secondary loan market, they are able to avoid the "lemons" problem faced by stand-alone banks.

Since 2006, train-to-train communication has been studied to respond to such requirements. A key characteristic of train-to-train communication is that operation control to avoid possible accidents is conducted among trains without help of a base station. This paper proposes a novel train-to-train communication model in a physical layer based on multihop and cooperation, taking a high-speed railway propagation channel into account. The mechanism of this model lies in {{the idea that a}} source train uses trains on other tracks as relays to transmit signals to destination train on the same track. Based on occurrence of these potential relays, such mechanism can be divided into three cases. In each case, BER is applied to evaluate properties of the proposed communication model.

40|$|The {{idea of the}} {{so-called}} "soft urban renewal" has been pursued in Vienna {{since the middle of}} the eighties. It's central point is the preservation and modernisation of the old building substance with regard of the inte rests of the inhabitants. Considering this objective the "Vienna Land Procurement and Urban Renewal Fund" subsidised the housing improvement to the amount of 23, 7 billion ATS between 1984 and 1995. Thereby it was possible to set off a renewal-volume of 27, 3 billion ATS and to finance at least 65 % of the general rehabilitation in Vienna. The means concentrate on the area of Vienna built on in the period of promoterism. However, the distribution of the means shows interesting differences between t he single rehabilitation bodies. 56, 5 % of the means got into the private building stock and fell nearly exclusively to buildings from the period of promoterism and before. A regression analysis shows that the spatial distribution of the means is predominantly determined by the share of flats from this period. Working places in the retail trade and connections to the tube show {{at the same time a}} significant negative influence. Thus the rehabilitation support mainly reached areas with a bad location quality and was made compensationally to the free financed rehabilitation works. In spite of urban renewal political objectives and the information activities of the di strict renewal offices the Vienna urban-renewal areas have no influence on the localisation of <b>subsidiary</b> <b>means.</b> Although the municipal housing stock comprises only 16 % of the Viennese flats built before 1945 it gained 38, 8 % of the means and profited by the improvement subsidy above average. Since the municipality manly conveys large-scale projects the distribution of the means shows a very heterogeneous spatial pattern with the stress on the verge of the densely built urban area. The explanation substance of the regression model for the rehabilitation subsidy of the municipal building stock is with 18 % very poor. The selection of the housing estates that are to be improves turns out to be a primarily political decision. The preservation state of the building as well as the incorporation of the rehabilitation into urban-development policies and objectives are of only secondary importance. Considering the new general condition of the Viennese urban development in the 90 ies a more effective use of <b>subsidiary</b> <b>means</b> seems to by absolutely necessary. The improvement support has to concentrate stronger on urban areas mostly from the period of promoterism that really require a renewal and has to be combined organisationally with the improvement of the residential surroundings. The stronger consideration of distributional- and housing-political effects of the improvement subsidy is also imperative...|$|E

Methods of questioning, interrogation are applied; the content-analysis and the correlation analysis of the received data. Results. Stages of the person’s creative self-development composing a dialectic cycle of formation and development of research skills of the pupil in educational process are noted. The interrelation between scientifically-methodical readiness of the teacher for development of research potential of students and features of the organisation of their work with the text is established. Ways of activization of pupils’ creative self-development are offered and shown while working with the electronic text and the Internet resources. The given ways allow to realize the idea of subjectiveness and the subjectivity, pointed within the limits of culturological and anthropological approaches to education; to stimulate the process of formation and personality growth of the student; to provide sensibleness of a student’s choice of own trajectory of education; to open its intellectual and creative abilities.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. In classical international law, States alone were the makers and subjects of the law. Times have changed. Contemporary international law admits, not only States as its subjects but also individuals and international organisations; it controls not just the needs of States but also the needs of individuals as it continues to venture into areas which, in the classical era, were exclusively reserved to domestic law. The fact that international law now applies to entities other than States {{is no longer a}} subject of controversy both in theory and practice. On the contrary, the question relating to whether international law could originate from a source other than through the consent of States in the positivist sense of the law has remained a question of controversy. The question has been made more complex by the multiplicity of international institutions created by States and vested with authority to perform the functions entrusted to them under international law. The functions they perform influence the behaviours and expectations of both States and individuals; but the powers they exercise belong to the States which delegated the powers. Since the powers are delegated by States, it should follow that the powers be confined by the very fact of delegation to the functions for which the powers had been granted. Such powers cannot be used for any other purpose, perhaps. With this in mind, the question sought to be answered in this work is whether the powers granted to International Court of Justice to “decide disputes” – article 38 (1) of the Statute of the Court) – implicates the power of judicial lawmaking. In other words, whether rules and principles arising from the decisions of the Court can be properly referred to as rules and principles of international law. The question becomes quite intriguing when placed within the context of article 38 (1) (d) and article 59 of the Statute of the Court on the one hand, and the practice of the Court and of the States appearing before it on the other hand. Articles 38 (1) (d) provides: “subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as <b>subsidiary</b> <b>means</b> for the determination of rules of law. ” By article 59 : “The decision of the Court has no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case”. Notwithstanding the language of the above provisions, it is shown in this work that like judges in municipal law, judges in the ICJ lay down rules and principles having legal implications for the decisions in subsequent cases {{as well as for the}} conduct of States, in general, regarding areas within the degrees of the settled case-law of the Court. It is accordingly argued that to the extent that rules and principles in the decisions of the Court are relevant as rules and principles of international law (in subsequent decisions of the Court) to the determination of international law rights and obligations of States, judicial decisions in article 38 (1) (d) are a source of international law. This is notwithstanding the unhelpful language of paragraph (d) and the influence of article 59. Concerning article 59, the writer argues that the article has no bearing on the authority of judicial decisions in article 38 (1) (d); its real function being to protect the legal rights and interests of States from a decision given in a case to which they were not parties...|$|E

Nakon toga govori se o sporazumima između suugovaratelja koji se ne smatraju obnovom. U nastavku se obrađuje razgraničenje obnove od sličnih instituta, a zatim pravni učinci valjanog ugovora o obnovi. U završnom poglavlju su sumirani rezultati analize izvršene u radu. According to the Obligations act (Official gazette, Nr. 35 / 05 and 41 / 08), renewal (novation, lat. novatio) is {{a contract}} between the creditor and debtor {{in which the}} existing obligation is terminated and {{is replaced by a}} new one, while the new contract has a different main obligation or different legal basis. Change of a subsidiary obligation is not considered a novation. For the novation it is necessary to cumulatively fulfil the following assumptions: 1. existence of a valid (old) main obligation, 2. will of the parties to exchange the existing obligation for a new one 3. difference between the main obligation or the legal basis, 4. will of the contractor (animus novandi). If the previous obligation was voidable, a legally valid novation is possible, but only if the debtor knew for the reasons of voidance. It is than taken that the debtor, by agreeing to novation, has given up the right to void the contract from which the obligation arises that is being renewed. If the debtor did not know about the voidance of the previous obligation, he is authorised to demand the termination of the contract about novation; after the contract on novation was terminated, it is considered that there was no novation and that the previous obligation did not stop. Novation has certain similarities with settlements and exchange of fulfilment, but still differs from these institutes. With novation, {{there has to be an}} intention and expressed will of the contract parties that by creating the new obligation the old one seizes to exist, while with settlement the previous legal relation is modified so that the first claim or obligation remain in some limited form. When talking about the realtion of novation and exchange of fulfilment, the difference is the following: whit novation the existing obligation is exchanged with a new one so that the old obligation seizes to exist without fulfilment, while with exchange of fulfilment the first obligation does not seize immediately – it seizes after he completes his new obligation. The basic legal impact of the legally valid contract on novation is shown in the fact that the previous obligation seizes to exist, and a new one starts instead. Means of insurance connected to the old obligation seize to exist as well (e. g. deposit, guarantee), as well as all the other <b>subsidiary</b> <b>means</b> – unless otherwise agreed upon in the contract. Nach dem Obligationengesetz (Amtsblatt Narodne novine Nr. 35 / 05 und 41 / 08) ist die Novation (novatio) ein Vertrag zwischen einem Gläubiger und einem Schuldner, durch den die bestehende Schuld erlischt und durch eine neue ersetzt wird, wobei sich der neue Vertrag auf eine andere Hauptleistung oder einen anderen Rechtsgrund bezieht. Die Veränderung einer Nebenleistung gilt nicht als Novation. Für die Novation müssen kumulativ folgende Voraussetzungen erfüllt sein: 1. das Bestehen einer gültigen (alten) Hauptschuld, 2. der Wille der Parteien, die bestehende Schuld durch eine neue zu ersetzen, 3. die Unterschiedlichkeit der Hauptleistung oder des Rechtsgrundes sowie 4. der Wille der Vertragsparteien (animus novandi). War die frühere Schuld anfechtbar, so ist eine rechtsgültige Novation möglich, allerdings nur, wenn der Schuldner den Grund der Anfechtbarkeit kannte. Dann wird davon ausgegangen, dass ein Schuldner, der der Novation zustimmt, auf sein Recht, den Vertrag, aus dem die erneuerte Schuld hervorgeht, anzufechten, verzichtet hat. Wusste der Schuldner nicht von der Anfechtbarkeit der früheren Schuld, ist er berechtigt, die Aufhebung des Novationsvertrags zu verlangen. Ist der Novationsvertrag aufgehoben, gilt, dass es keine Novation gab und die frühere Schuld nicht erloschen ist. Die Novation hat gewisse Ähnlichkeiten mit dem Vergleich und dem Erfüllungsersatz, unterscheidet sich aber von diesen Instituten. Bei der Novation muss die Absicht und der bekundete Wille der Vertragsparteien bestehen, dass mit Entstehung einer neuen Schuld die alte erlischt, während beim Vergleich das frühere Rechtsverhältnis modifiziert wird, sodass der ursprüngliche Anspruch beziehungsweise die Schuld in einer geminderten Form weiter bestehen. Zwischen der Novation und dem Erfüllungsersatz wiederum besteht der Unterschied, dass bei der Novation die bisherige Schuld durch eine neue ersetzt wird, sodass die alte Schuld ohne Erfüllung endet, während beim Erfüllungsersatz die ursprüngliche Schuld des Schuldners nicht sofort erlischt, sondern erst, wenn er seine neue Schuld geleistet hat. Die grundlegende Rechtswirkung eines rechtsgültigen Novationsvertrags äußert sich darin, dass die frühere Schuld erlischt und statt ihrer eine neue entsteht. Auch Sicherheiten (z. B. Pfand, Bürgschaft), die an die frühere Schuld geknüpft waren, sowie sonstige Nebenansprüche erlöschen, sofern nichts anderes vereinbart wurde...|$|E
40|$|The {{velocity}} {{fields of}} a turbulent wake behind a flat plate {{obtained from the}} direct numerical simulations of Moser et al. are used to study {{the structure of the}} flow in the intermittent zone where there are, alternately, regions of fully turbulent flow and non-turbulent velocity fluctuations either side of a thin randomly moving interface. Comparisons are made with a wake that is 'forced' by amplifying initial velocity fluctuations. There is also a random temperature field T in the flow; T varies between constant values of 0. 0 and 1. 0 {{on the sides of the}} wake. The value of the Reynolds number based on the centreplane mean velocity defect and halfwidth b of the wake is Re approx. = 2000. It is found that the thickness of the continuous interface is about equal to 0. 07 b, whereas the amplitude of fluctuations of the instantaneous interface displacement y(sub I) (t) is an order of magnitude larger, being about 0. 5 b. This explains why the mean statistics of vorticity in the intermittent zone can be calculated in terms of the probability distribution of y(sub I) and the instantaneous discontinuity in vorticity across the interface. When plotted as functions of y - y(sub I), the conditional mean velocity (U) and temperature (T) profiles show sharp jumps Delta(U) and Delta(T) at the interface adjacent to a thick zone where (U) and (T) vary much more slowly. Statistics for the vorticity and velocity variances, available in such detail only from DNS data, show how streamwise and spanwise components of vorticity are generated by vortex stretching in the bulges of the interface. Flow fields around the interface, analyzed in terms of the local streamline pattern, confirm previous results that the advancement of the vortical interface into the irrotational flow is driven by large-scale eddy motion. It is argued that because this is an inviscid mechanism the entrainment process is not sensitive to the value of Re, and that small-scale nibbling only plays a <b>subsidiary</b> role. While <b>mean</b> Reynolds stresses decrease gradually in the intermittent zone, conditional stresses are found to decrease sharply towards zero at the interface. Using one-point turbulence models applied to either unconditional or conditional statistics for the turbulent region and then averaged, the entrainment rate E(sub b) would, if calculated exactly, be zero. But if computed with standard computational methods, E(sub b) would be non-zero because of numerical diffusion. It is concluded that the current practice in statistical models of approximating entrainment by a diffusion process is computationally arbitrary and physically incorrect. An analysis shows how E(sub b) is related to Delta(U) and the jump in shear stress at the interface, and correspondingly to Delta(T) and the heat flux...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there have}} been a number of {{critical}} works on the novel given over to topics such as adventure, colonization or the politics of the frontier, a comparative study of novels in which an encounter with unknown territory holds central importance has till now been lacking. My aim in this thesis is to analyse and relate a variety of texts which show representatives of a home culture in confrontation with terra incognita or unfamiliar peoples. There is, as it turns out, a strong family resemblance between the novels that fall into this category whether they belong, like Robinson Crusoe, Coral Island or Lord of the Flies, to the "desert island" tradition where castaways have exploration thrust upon them or present, as in the case of Moby Dick, The Lost World or Voss, ventures deliberately undertaken. There are frequent indications, too, that many of the novelists in question are aware of working within a particular, <b>subsidiary</b> genre. This <b>means,</b> in sum, even when it comes to texts as culturally remote as, say, Captain Singleton and Heart of Darkness that there is firm ground for comparison. The emphasis of this study is, in consequence, historical as well as critical. In order to show that many conventions which are recurrent in the fiction inhere in the actual business of coming to grips with the unknown, I begin with a theoretical introduction illustrated chiefly from the writings of explorers. Travelogues reveal how large a part projection plays in every rendering of unvisited places. So much is imported that one might hypothesize, for the sake of a model, a single locality returning a stream of widely divergent images over the lapse of years. In effect it is possible to demonstrate a shift of cultural assumptions by juxtaposing, for example, a passage that tricks out a primeval forest in all the iconography of Eden with one written three centuries later in which - from essentially the same scene - the author paints a picture of Malthusian struggle and survival of the fittest. And since the explorer is not only inclined to embody his image of the natural man in the people he meets beyond the frontiers of his own culture, but is likely also to read his own emancipation from the constraints of polity in terms of a return to an underlying nature, the concern with genesis is one that recurs with particular persistence in texts dealing with exploration. With varying degrees of awareness novelists have responded, ever since Defoe, to the idea that the encounter with the unfamiliar mirrors the identity of the explorer. Their presentations of terra incognita register the crucial phases of social history - the institution of mercantilism, the rise and fall of empire - but generally in relation to psychological and metaphysical questions of a perennial kind. The nature of man is a theme that proves, indeed, remarkably tenacious in these works, for a reason Lawrence notes in Kangaroo: "There is always something outside our universe. And it is always at the doors of the innermost, sentient soul"...|$|R

This paper examines how differences in the institutional environments of a multinational enterprise (MNE) shape the role of management control systems (MCSs) and social capital in the headquarters-subsidiary relationship of an emerging economy MNE. A case study design was adopted in this research {{in order to understand}} how the differences in the institutional environments of an MNE shape the design and use of MCSs. Data was gathered by means of semi-structured interviews, document analysis and observations. Interviews were conducted at the Nigerian headquarter (HQ) and United Kingdom (UK) subsidiary of the Nigerian service multinational enterprise (NSMNE). The study found that the subsidiary operated autonomously, given its residence in a stronger institutional environment than the HQ. Instead of the HQ depending on MCSs means of coordination and control, it relied on social capital that existed between the HQ and subsidiary to coordinate and integrate the operation of the foreign subsidiary studied. The evidence from this research indicates that social capital could be effective in the integration and coordination of multinational operations. However, where social capital becomes the main mechanism of coordination and integration of HQ-subsidiary operations, the focus may have to be, as in this case, on organisational social capital and the need to achieve group goals, rather than specifically designated target goals for the subsidiary. The implication of this is that it may limit the potential of the subsidiary to explore its environment and search for opportunities. These are important insights into the relationship between developed country based subsidiaries and their LDC based HQs. A practical implication of this research is in the use of local or expatriate staff to manage the operation of the subsidiary. While previous studies on the MNE, from the conventional perspective of multinational operation, suggest expatriates may be sent to the subsidiary to head key positions so as to enable the HQ to have control of the subsidiary operation, it is different in this case. The NSMNE has adopted a policy of using locals who have the expertise and understanding of the UK institutional environment to manage the subsidiary’s operation. This research shades some light on how development issues associated with a multinational institutional environment may shape the business activities and the relationship between the headquarter and subsidiary. It gives some understanding of how policies and practices may have different impacts on employees as businesses attempt to adjust to pressures from their external environment(s). The reliance on social capital as a means of coordination and control of the foreign subsidiary in this study is significant, given that previous studies have indicated that multinational HQs normally transfer controls and structure to foreign <b>subsidiaries</b> as a <b>means</b> of control. Also, while previous studies have suggested that MNEs HQ have better expertise that enables them to design and transfer MCSs to foreign subsidiaries, this study found that such expertise relates to the institutional environment from which the HQ is operating from. Through the lens of institutional sociology theory, these findings directly contribute to the literature on the transference of practices and control systems in international business discourse...|$|R
