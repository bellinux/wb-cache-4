5|$|In 2012, {{a report}} was {{published}} stating {{the first case}} of CCD, according to more <b>stringent</b> definitions, occurring outside of the US was in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|In many European {{countries}} (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) {{the risk}} or dose limit for {{a member of}} the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more <b>stringent</b> than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more <b>stringent</b> than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20, and more <b>stringent</b> by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository for the first 10,000 years after closure. Moreover, the U.S. EPA’s proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, benzodiazepines are Schedule IV drugs {{under the}} Federal Controlled Substances Act, even when {{not on the}} market (for example, {{nitrazepam}} and bromazepam). Flunitrazepam is subject to more <b>stringent</b> regulations in certain states and temazepam prescriptions require specially coded pads in certain states.|$|E
5|$|Students who {{successfully}} complete the school's required curriculum earn the Baltimore City College diploma upon graduation, {{which has been}} granted since 1851. The requirements are more <b>stringent</b> than those designated by the State of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{led to more}} <b>stringent</b> {{gun control}} laws in Canada. It also introduced changes in the tactical response of police to shootings, changes which were later credited with minimizing casualties at the Dawson College shootings.|$|E
5|$|The “sea-bittered sailors” {{were not}} pleased with these <b>stringent</b> regulations, and in 1825 the English whaler Daniel caused rioting {{in the town}} {{for three days and}} even gave out life threats to Reverend William Richards.|$|E
5|$|A {{sport or}} {{discipline}} {{appears on the}} Pan American Games program if it is included on the Olympic program. For the traditional Pan American Games sports, PASO determines if they are widely practised around the Americas; that is, the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sport's prevalence. PASO's requirements reflect participation in the Pan American Games as well, especially more <b>stringent</b> toward men (as they are represented in higher numbers).|$|E
5|$|As it is {{constructed}} using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take {{on the same}} form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more <b>stringent</b> general principle of relativity, namely that {{the laws of physics}} are the same for all observers. Locally, as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and the laws of physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} {{nature and the}} beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively <b>stringent</b> and can be difficult to meet in cultivation. As a result, most species are unavailable commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have made their way into the mainstream nursery business and can often be found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E
5|$|Christy was {{appointed}} Vice President and Provost of Caltech in 1970. Under Christy and President Harold Brown Caltech expanded its humanities and added economics to {{allow students to}} broaden their education. He had David Morrisroe appointed as Vice President for Financial Affairs, and they steered Caltech through the financially <b>stringent</b> 1970s. The first women were admitted as undergraduates in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms {{about the}} ISA {{and the state}} of freedom of speech and {{assembly}} in Singapore also appear in reports by some foreign and international organizations. A 2007 report by Lawyers' Rights Watch Canada, Rule of Law in Singapore, alleged that defamation and bankruptcy law had been used to oppress the political opposition, and expressed concern about <b>stringent</b> limits on the freedom of assembly and detention under the ISA.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{considers}} the topology of coupled tuned circuits to involve a separate approximation technique to the insertion-loss method, but also producing nominally flat passbands and high attenuation stopbands. The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, {{or in the}} case of a two-section filter, by mutual inductance. These are most useful where the design requirement is not too <b>stringent,</b> that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband ripple.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{rationing}} {{was imposed}} almost immediately. Restrictions were immediately more <b>stringent</b> {{than in the}} Great War as with effect from 8 January 1940 ration books were issued and most foods were subject to ration. By August 1940, legislation was passed that made the wasting of food a prisonable offence. Posters encouraged kitchen waste {{to be used for}} feeding animals, primarily swine but also poultry.|$|E
5|$|Fine-mapping {{requires}} all variants in {{the associated}} region {{to have been}} genotyped or imputed (dense coverage), very <b>stringent</b> quality control resulting in high-quality genotypes, and large sample sizes sufficient in separating out highly correlated signals. There are several different methods to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior probability that a variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are often difficult to satisfy, there are still limited examples of these methods being more generally applied.|$|E
5|$|In a {{political}} and economic referendum held in November 1987, 67% of the eligible voters participated {{and most of them}} approved the government-proposed reforms, but a popular mandate was formally missed because of the unrealistically <b>stringent</b> passage requirements self-imposed by the regime. The referendum debacle dealt a blow to the process of market-oriented economic reforms, which had been pursued by Polish governments since the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In both later {{works such}} as Caroline Mordaunt and her earlier evangelical texts, Sherwood participated in the Victorian project of {{prescribing}} gender roles; while her later works outlined ever more <b>stringent</b> and narrow roles for each sex, her early {{works such as}} The Fairchild Family suggested such demarcations as well: Lucy and Emily learn to sew and keep house while Henry tends the garden and learns Latin.|$|E
5|$|In mid-November 2008, Zardari's {{government}} officially sent {{a letter}} of intent to the IMF regarding a bailout to help increase its foreign exchange reserves. In a $11.3 billion multi-year loan package, Pakistan received a $7.4 billion loan for 2008–10. The IMF stipulated <b>stringent</b> reform conditions, which included rebuilding the tax structure and privatising state enterprises. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank withheld a combined $3 billion aid in the 2010–11 fiscal year and the IMF withheld since May 2010 the last segment of its aid package.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, {{platinum}} wire {{is used for}} electrodes; platinum pans and supports are used in thermogravimetric analysis because of the <b>stringent</b> requirements of chemical inertness upon heating to high temperatures (~1000°C). Platinum is used as an alloying agent for various metal products, including fine wires, noncorrosive laboratory containers, medical instruments, dental prostheses, electrical contacts, and thermocouples. Platinum-cobalt, an alloy of roughly three parts platinum and one part cobalt, is used to make relatively strong permanent magnets. Platinum-based anodes are used in ships, pipelines, and steel piers.|$|E
5|$|Its design {{began in}} September 2005 with {{sketches}} by Jason Castriota moving through computer aided sculpture and <b>stringent</b> wind tunnel testing. More than 200 components were designed {{especially for the}} car. Most components, including the engine, drivetrain, are modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo from which it was derived. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on August 18, 2006 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elégance and shown again at the Paris Motor Show in late September.|$|E
5|$|Nazi {{society had}} {{elements}} supportive of animal rights {{and many people}} were fond of zoos and wildlife. The government took several measures to ensure the protection of animals and the environment. In 1933, the Nazis enacted a <b>stringent</b> animal-protection law that affected what was allowed for medical research. However, the law was only loosely enforced {{and in spite of}} a ban on vivisection the Ministry of the Interior readily handed out permits for experiments on animals.|$|E
5|$|One of Morgan's stated {{interests}} was to lead {{a program}} of research into household practices; {{she did not want}} to teach traditional home economics principles if they could not be supported by science. This meant that her students were required to possess a science background that was more <b>stringent</b> than other U.S. home economics programs. Consequently, her graduates found themselves prepared for roles that had not usually been open to traditional home economics graduates, such as hospital nutrition management and teaching in the basic sciences.|$|E
5|$|Presidential {{elections}} in Singapore, {{in which the}} President of Singapore is directly elected by popular vote, were introduced through amendments to the Constitution of Singapore in 1991. Potential candidates for office have to fulfil <b>stringent</b> qualifications {{set out in the}} Constitution. Certificates of eligibility are issued by the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC). In particular, the PEC must assess that they are persons of integrity, good character and reputation; and if they have not previously held certain key government appointments or were the chief executives of profitable companies with shareholders' equity of an average of S$500 million for the most recent three years in that office, they must demonstrate to the PEC that they held a position of comparable seniority and responsibility in the public or private sector that has given them experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs. The general strictness of the required qualifications led to the walkovers in 3 out of 5 of the presidential elections, as presidents S. R. Nathan and Halimah Yacob were the sole candidates to receive a certificate of eligibility from the PEC in their respective years in the 1999, 2005 and 2017 elections. The <b>stringent</b> criteria, the transparency of the PEC's decision-making process and the practice of political parties endorsing candidates have drawn criticism.|$|E
5|$|Some {{specialized}} {{types of}} oil tankers have evolved. One {{of these is}} the naval replenishment oiler, a tanker which can fuel a moving vessel. Combination ore-bulk-oil carriers and permanently moored floating storage units are two other variations on the standard oil tanker design. Oil tankers have been involved in a number of damaging and high-profile oil spills. As a result, they are subject to <b>stringent</b> design and operational regulations.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution vests {{the three}} {{branches}} of the state with different aspects of governmental power. The executive {{is made up of}} the President and the Cabinet, which is headed by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet is accountable to the electorate and is an embodiment of representative democracy. The President is elected by the people to act as a constitutional safeguard in protecting the national reserves and preserving the integrity of the public service. To qualify as a presidential candidate, <b>stringent</b> criteria must be satisfied.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{initially}} {{took the}} form of symbolic protests and a campaign by Spanish diplomats and the state-controlled media. From 1954, Spain imposed increasingly <b>stringent</b> restrictions on trade and the movements of vehicles and people across the border with Gibraltar. Further restrictions were imposed in 1964, and in 1966 the frontier was closed to vehicles. In 1969, after the passing of the Gibraltar Constitution Order, to which Spain strongly objected, the frontier was closed completely and Gibraltar's telecommunications links through Spain were cut.|$|E
5|$|The main {{tension between}} {{fisheries}} {{science and the}} fishing industry {{is that the two}} groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing. In places such as Scotland, Newfoundland, and Alaska the fishing industry is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it. On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for <b>stringent</b> protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>stringent</b> {{tests are}} {{reserved}} for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting {{less than a month}} (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.|$|E
5|$|The {{new rules}} {{adopted in the}} 1997 annexes to the SOLAS {{convention}} focused on problems such as reinforcing bulkheads and the longitudinal frame, more <b>stringent</b> inspections (with a particular focus on corrosion) and routine in-port inspections. The 1997 additions also required bulkers with restrictions (for instance, forbidden from carrying certain types of cargoes) to mark their hulls with large, easy-to-see triangles.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} model utilised the same Alcan bonded honeycomb aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT) as the concept {{car for the}} chassis. The chassis design featured two box section rails which acted as the suspension mounting points and would provide an energy absorbing structure {{in the event of}} a frontal impact, these were successfully tested at speeds up to , an integral roll cage formed part of the chassis and monocoque, providing additional structural rigidity for the car and allowing the XJ220 to easily pass <b>stringent</b> crash testing.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that the President should be a person of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this <b>stringent</b> screening process is necessary as the President does not stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E
5|$|The <b>stringent</b> {{rules of}} Ubi periculum {{were used in}} the conclaves that elected Pope Innocent V (January 1276) and Pope Adrian V (July 1276), lasting one and nine days respectively. However, at the urgings of the College, the newly elected Adrian V {{suspended}} the constitution on July 12, 1276—indicating that he wished to revise it—and died on August 18, without having promulgated a revised version.|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{initially}} taken as postulates, but {{today there are}} efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine structure constant {{over much of the}} age of the universe is of order 10−5. Also, general relativity has passed <b>stringent</b> tests on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.|$|E
5|$|To {{operate on}} these lines would require new or heavily {{modified}} rolling stock designed {{to operate at}} these different voltages, {{in addition to those}} already in use. Signalling systems also differ. In addition to the infrastructure difficulties, any potential Eurostar services beyond Paris and Brussels would also require the installation of <b>stringent</b> security measures, due to the UK's not having signed up to the Schengen Agreement, which allows unrestricted movement across borders of member countries.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving with}} the Grand Fleet, Battleship Division Nine {{was forced to}} adapt quickly to {{unfamiliar}} British methods and standards. New signals and maneuvers were adopted relatively smoothly, while more <b>stringent</b> gunnery standards proved more difficult to achieve. On a personal level, relations between American and British officers and men were notably cordial.|$|E
5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Harry Blackmun held that natural parents have a right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the burden of proof used by New York State is not <b>stringent</b> enough to satisfy the constitutional requirements of the due process clause. In striking down New York's burden, the Court utilized the Mathews test to determine what burden of proof was due.|$|E
5|$|A 1983 {{industry}} crash, {{caused by}} the market being overrun with low-quality products, prompted {{a higher degree of}} regulation by future console manufacturers: when the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was launched in the United States in 1985, Nintendo of America instituted requirements and restrictions on third-party developers, including the requirement for all games to be licensed by the company. The console itself also included a lockout chip to enforce this requirement and prevent the console from loading unlicensed games. Such leverage on developers has since become a standard practice among console makers, although Nintendo of America also had <b>stringent</b> content policies, frequently censoring blood, sexual content, and references to religion, tobacco and alcohol from games released on its consoles in the United States.|$|E
