5|$|Veronica Nicholson, {{a friend}} with {{connections}} in the publishing trade, persuaded David to continue writing, with the aim that she write a book. She showed some of David's work to Anne Scott-James, {{the editor of the}} British magazine Harper's Bazaar, who thought the writing showed a widely travelled person with an independent mind. <b>She</b> <b>offered</b> David a contract, and David's work began appearing in the publication from March 1949.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing the}} last girl, Yogesh's mother beseeches him to choose with his heart {{instead of his}} mind. Yogesh sees all of the girls in a dream, {{and in the morning}} decides who he will marry. He goes to Rajni's office because <b>she</b> <b>offered</b> a 50-million-rupee dowry, and is {{relieved}} to discover that she is marrying someone else. Yogesh goes to Devu's house to tell him he wants to marry Vishakha, but Devu calls her and rejects her. He says {{there is no need for}} Yogesh to marry her; he knows about Jitu's debt, and says he will choose Yogesh's bride himself.|$|E

5|$|Alice's sister, Melisende, Fulk's wife, persuaded Fulk {{to allow}} Alice {{to return to}} Antioch in 1135. Alice wanted to tighten the {{relationship}} of the principality and the Byzantine Empire; therefore, <b>she</b> <b>offered</b> Constance's hand to Manuel, a son of the Byzantine Emperor, John II Komnenos. To prevent the Byzantine marriage, Fulk sent his envoy France to Raymond of Poitiers to urge him to come to Antioch, which he did, traveling in disguise, because RogerII of Sicily wanted to capture him in southern Italy.|$|E
5|$|Aphrodite– The Goddess of Love and Sexuality, and {{widow of}} Hephaestus. In God of War, Aphrodite helped Kratos by {{empowering}} {{the head of}} the slain Medusa and giving it to Kratos as a magical weapon. In God of War III, <b>she</b> <b>offered</b> advice regarding the architect Daedalus. After seducing Kratos, Aphrodite directed him to her estranged husband. She is the only god that Kratos did not kill that was present in God of War III. The character was voiced by Carole Ruggier in God of War, and April Stewart in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|Back at {{the house}} her odd {{behaviour}} continued; most notably <b>she</b> <b>offered</b> the men cigarettes, only to quickly snatch {{them out of their}} mouths as the men smoked them, claiming the cigarettes to be poisoned. She was also carrying multiple mobile phones, as well as a laptop. She appeared to be paranoid and constantly looked out of the windows; this behaviour caused Molloy to assume that she had run away from an abusive partner. Shortly before midnight Molloy left the two, and Sabina stayed the night in Hollinshead's home.|$|E

5|$|Despite the polls, Douglas was {{confident}} that the Democratic registration edge would lead her to victory, {{so much so that}} <b>she</b> <b>offered</b> a Roosevelt staffer a job in her senatorial office. On election day, November 7, 1950, Nixon defeated Douglas by 59percent to 41. Of California's 58counties, Douglas won only five, all in Northern California and with relatively small populations; Nixon won every urban area. Although Warren defeated Roosevelt by an even larger margin, Nixon won by the greatest number of votes of any 1950 Senate candidate. Douglas, in her concession speech, declined to congratulate Nixon. Marcantonio was also defeated in his New York district.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Elissa Wall filed {{a multimillion-dollar}} {{lawsuit against the}} FLDS, Warren Jeffs, and the UEP Trust with the {{expressed}} intention to assist {{other members of the}} FLDS in leaving the community. The suit was ongoing for several years afterwards, and a CPA filed a counter-lawsuit in response, charging that Wall's family, not the FLDS or the UEP Trust, was responsible for her underage marriage. In June 2009, <b>she</b> <b>offered</b> to settle the suit for $308,000, the land her family lives on, and some other properties.|$|E
5|$|Laing, who {{was charged}} with maleficium, confessed she had made spells with buckets of water and burning coals as well as {{stabbing}} needles into a wax model of her intended victim. She met the Devil {{in the form of}} a black dog on Ceres Moor and made a bargain with him; she knew he was the Devil as he had the ability to change shape and had undergone a transformation in front of her. Initially <b>she</b> <b>offered</b> him her daughter then her granddaughter who was six years old. The four other women were named as co-conspirators in her confession.|$|E

5|$|Laurent {{had also}} planned another feature film, Putain de pluie!, {{produced}} by Alain Attal's Productions du Trésor, whose script she co-wrote with Morgan Perez and which {{she intended to}} direct. Originally set for filming {{in the spring of}} 2009, it was postponed because of her work on Inglourious Basterds. Knowing that she could speak French, and had already acted in French in one of the short films in Paris, je t'aime, <b>she</b> <b>offered</b> the first role to Natalie Portman, who declined because of the script's language.|$|E
5|$|Pound {{was also}} {{introduced}} to sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, painter Wyndham Lewis {{and to the}} cream of London's literary circle, including the poet T. E. Hulme. The American heiress Margaret Lanier Cravens (1881–1912) became a patron; after knowing him a short time <b>she</b> <b>offered</b> a large annual sum {{to allow him to}} focus on his work. Cravens killed herself in 1912, after the pianist Walter Rummel, long the object of her affection, married someone else. She may also have been discouraged by Pound's engagement to Dorothy.|$|E
5|$|Recent historians, however, {{have taken}} a more {{complicated}} view of Elizabeth. Her reign is famous for {{the defeat of the}} Armada, and for successful raids against the Spanish, such as those on Cádiz in 1587 and 1596, but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea. In Ireland, Elizabeth's forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record. Rather than as a brave defender of the Protestant nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. <b>She</b> <b>offered</b> very limited aid to foreign Protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.|$|E

5|$|With the {{acquisition}} of speed in a trade with the Pittsburgh Pirates, including Dots Miller, Art Butler, Cozy Dolan and Chief Wilson, the Cardinals contended for the NL pennant in 1914. Finishing in third place, it was the Cardinals' best finish since 1876, but they fell back to sixth in 1915 and last in 1916. When Britton sold the team after that season, <b>she</b> <b>offered</b> Huggins a chance to buy {{a part of the}} team. While he was attempting to raise money from the Fleischmann family, Britton sold the team to a group headed by Samuel Breadon, who hired Branch Rickey to run the team's day-to-day operations in the front office.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. <b>She</b> <b>offered</b> an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 until 1966 she dwelt {{in a flat}} at 8 Holly Hill, Hampstead, {{which was}} owned by the husband {{of one of her}} OMS students, the Latvian exile and poet Velta Snikere. After leaving Holly Hill, Montalban moved to a flat in the Queen Alexandra Mansions at 3 Grape Street in the St. Giles {{district}} of Holborn. Here, she was in close proximity to the two primary bookstores then catering to occult interests, Atlantis Bookshop and Watkins Bookshop, {{as well as to the}} British Museum. <b>She</b> <b>offered</b> one of the rooms in her flat to a young astrologer and musician, Rick Hayward, whom she had met in the summer of 1967; he joined the OMS, and in the last few months of Montalban's life authored her astrological forecasts for Prediction. After her death, he continued publishing astrological prophecies in Prediction and Prediction Annual until summer 2012.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, the {{publishing}} company Robert Hale brought out Valiente's second book, An ABC of Witchcraft, {{in which she}} provided an encyclopaedic overview of various topics related to Wicca and esotericism. In 1975, Hale published Valiente's Natural Magic, a discussion of what she {{believed to be the}} magical usages and associations of the weather, stones, plants, and other elements of the natural world. In 1978 Hale then published Witchcraft for Tomorrow, in which Valiente proclaimed her belief that Wicca was ideal for the dawning Age of Aquarius and espoused James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis. It also explained to the reader how they could initiate themselves into Wicca and establish their own coven. In 1978 <b>she</b> <b>offered</b> a book of poetry to Hale, although they declined to publish it, believing that there would not be sufficient market for such a publication. In 1982 she then submitted a book of short stories, The Witch Ball, to Hale, but again they declined to publish it.|$|E
5|$|James Nesbitt and {{his agent}} {{attended}} {{a meeting with}} Jane Tranter in late 2005 regarding the 2006 series of Murphy's Law. At {{the conclusion of the}} meeting, <b>she</b> <b>offered</b> him a script for Jekyll, suggesting that he might like the role. Nesbitt took the script role as a way of putting a distance between his previous work. The casting of Nesbitt as Tom Jackman and Hyde was publicised on 12 December 2005, but filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006, increasing Nesbitt's anticipation to play the roles. Writer Steven Moffat said that the dual-role required a very skilled actor, and a well-known actor was necessary because it was such an expensive show to produce. The production team decided Nesbitt's two characters would be mainly differentiated over a change in performance rather than by extensive make-up because they wanted Hyde {{to be able to walk}} around in public without attracting attention.|$|E
5|$|Opening {{arguments}} by both {{prosecution and}} defense set up cases based on purported times of death. Basing their assertion on pathologist-given testimony that Jones had died {{about six hours}} after she ate lunch on May 26, the prosecution claimed that Jones had died more than 24 hours before Kinne and Boldizs found her body; defense attorneys argued that death had more likely occurred six to eight hours prior. Prosecutor J. Arnott Hill cited testimony by Chief of Detectives Lieutenant Harry Nesbitt and by Patricia Jones's husband, Walter, as evidence of Kinne's motive for the crime: the detective recalled statements by Kinne that she was afraid Jones was drifting away from her despite the financial support <b>she</b> <b>offered</b> him, and Jones testified that Kinne had {{told him she was}} pregnant by him and he had thereafter attempted to end the relationship.|$|E
