40|$|When {{considering}} hub-and-spoke networks with <b>single</b> <b>allocation,</b> {{the absence}} of alternative routes makes this kind of systems specially vulnerable to congestion effects. In order to improve the design of such networks, congestion costs must be addressed. This article deploys two different techniques for addressing congestion on <b>single</b> <b>allocation</b> hub-and-spoke networks: the Generalized Benders Decomposition and the Outer Approximation method. Both methods are able to solve large scale instances. Computational experiments show how the adoption of advanced solution strategies, such as Pareto-optimal cut generation on the Master Problem branch-and-bound tree, may be decisive. They also demonstrate that the solution effort is not only associated {{with the size of}} the instances, but also with their combination of the installation and congestion costs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} a <b>single</b> <b>allocation</b> problem in {{hub-and-spoke}} networks.

We handle the case where the number of hubs is three, which {{is known to be}} NP-hard, and present a (5 / 4) -approximation algorithm. The <b>single</b> <b>allocation</b> problem includes a special class of the metric labeling problem, defined by introducing an assumption that both objects and labels are embedded in a common metric space. Under this assumption, we can apply our algorithms to the metric labeling problem without losing theoretical approximation ratios. As a byproduct, we also obtain a (4 / 3) -approximation algorithm for an ordinary metric labeling problem with three labels...|$|R

40|$|Hub-and-spoke {{designs are}} {{frequently}} {{used in many}} types of transportation and communication networks. The challenge to academics is to develop effective solution procedures for determining the number of hubs, locating hub facilities and allocating the non-hubs to the hubs. In this note, {{we deal with the}} capacitated <b>single</b> <b>allocation</b> hub location problem (CSAHLP) in which each non-hub can only be allocated to a single hub, each hub has its capacity constraint, and the objective function includes fixed costs for establishing hubs. A problem closely related to the CSAHLP is the uncapacitated <b>single</b> <b>allocation</b> hub location problem (USAHLP). We have proposed a hybrid heuristic for solving the USAHLP with competitive results obtained. In this note, an effective procedure to allocate the non-hubs to the capacitated hubs is developed to be embedded in the previous hybrid heuristic to solve the CSAHLP. Computational results show the presented heuristic is capable of obtaining optimal solutions for almost all small-scale problems and outperforms a simulated annealing algorithm from the literature in solving the large-scale CSAHLP. It is expected that this note can provide distribution managers an effective heuristic to design hub-and-spoke networks where the volume of traffic that a hub can collect is restricted. capacitated hub location problem; CHLP; p-hub median problem; uncapacitated hub location problem; UHLP; hub-and-spoke design; hub allocation. ...|$|R
