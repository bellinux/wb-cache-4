5|$|By 1974, the {{majority}} of the freeway that US-64 was to occupy in Tulsa was complete, and it was relocated onto the completed portion of the freeway. Only the portion in the downtown <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was yet to be completed. The remainder of the freeway, the concurrency with Interstate 444, was not completed until about 1983. The next and final major modification to the designation of US-64 took place when it was moved from its route through eastern Tulsa onto the newly constructed Creek Turnpike over the first half of 1992. The route has undergone only minor changes since then.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen lost around 22,000 of its {{population}} of 65,000 to the plague in 1711. The city was also struck by two major fires which destroyed much of its infrastructure. The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was {{the largest in the}} history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was completely lost. Along with the 1795 fire, it is the main reason that few traces of the old town {{can be found in the}} modern city.|$|E

5|$|High waves caused beach erosion northward through Virginia.

In Newport News, lightning set a roof on fire in the Lee Hall <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Emily's light rains in the area were not enough to break a prolonged drought that plagued Virginia.

5|$|In Bay County, M-15 follows Tuscola Road {{where it}} meets the western {{terminus}} of M-138 which runs along Munger Road in Munger. As the highway enters Bay City on the southeast side of town, Tuscola Road leaves the farmlands for residential areas of Bay City. The roadway runs northerwesterly near the St. Stanislaus, St. Patrick and Elm Lawn cemeteries, before turning north on Trumbull Street at 10th Street. The highway follows Trumbull Street for five blocks, where the highway designation ends at a four-way intersection with M-25/Center Avenue.

During the storm, about 100people ran to a trash incinerator, a concrete-reinforced building. A few of the local Black churches suffered significant damage. Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church lost many bricks on its front facade {{and much of the}} metal grillwork around the entrances, while the building itself was deroofed. Payne Chapel AME Church, then located at Banyan Boulevard and Tamarind Avenue, was destroyed by the storm. St. Patrick's Catholic Church received about $40,000 in damage.|$|E

It ascends to meet York Mills Road and ends at Highway401.|$|E
5|$|After that, {{the highway}} enters Lower Saucon Township in Northampton County and crosses under I-78 without an interchange. Past this, PA 378 heads north through the {{community}} of Seidersville, where it passes homes and businesses as a four-lane road parallel to Old Philadelphia Pike. The road traverses South Mountain where it runs through forested areas with some homes. Descending the mountain, PA 378 bends northwestward as a four lane arterial known as Wyandotte Street until leaving the University Heights area near Holy Ghost Cemetery. PA378 continues into the city of Bethlehem, where it turns northward into residential areas as a two-lane road and is called Wyandotte Street. In the South Side <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> PA378 intersects with the northern terminus of PA412 (Broadway). The route continues northward and intersects a ramp to 3rd Street that provides access to PA412, at which point it widens to four lanes.

When the Germans did invade, they forced Syvia's family to relocate, along with other Łódź-area Jews, into a segregated section of the city: a ghetto. The book relates Syvia's explanations of what life in the ghetto is like: her friends, people around the ghetto, jobs, and her schedule. It relates how Syvia's family is forced to sell her doll, leaving her with rags and buttons as her playthings.|$|E

5|$|Leland {{is home to}} Fishtown, and the ferries to the Manitou Islands off {{the coast}} of the Leelanau Peninsula. Continuing northward, M-22 reaches its northernmost extent in Northport before turning south. It passes through the {{reservation}} of the Grand Traverse Band of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians in Peshawbestown, home to one of the tribe's two casinos. Further south is the community of Suttons Bay located on the small bay of the same name. From here south, the highway runs just off the shore of the Grand Traverse Bay south to Greilickville. Just south of Greilickville, M-22 enters a <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Traverse City that's located in Leelanau County, Michigan formed by an acquisition of a neighborhood of Greilickville. Here is the eastern junction between M-22 and M-72. The two highways run concurrently along Grandview Parkway to Division Street. There they meet US31/M-37 and M-22 ends. A portion of this road has been designated a what is now called a Pure Michigan Scenic Byway by the state of Michigan.|$|E

Here, MDOT has calculated the lowest average daily traffic counts of all on US131: 5,114cars and 448trucks in 2009. The highway passes through rural Charlevoix County where the terrain has many rolling hills and begins to descend to Lake Michigan. As the highway enters the southern <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Petoskey it runs along Spring Street passing retail establishments and the Odawa Casino, owned by the Little Traverse Bay Indian Reservation of the Odawa Indians.

5|$|Early on the {{afternoon}} of Thursday, March1, at 1:08pm CST (19:08 UTC), a destructive tornado first developed near the Enterprise Municipal Airport. The tornado lifted off the ground briefly before returning to the ground as an even stronger storm. It quickly slammed into Enterprise, Alabama, at 1:12pm CST (19:12 UTC). The tornado left severe damage throughout a large <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> The most severe damage took place at Enterprise High School, where a section of the school was destroyed {{during the middle of the}} school day. Eight students were killed at the school and 50 other people were taken to local hospitals. Some early reports suggested that there had been as many as 15 deaths at Enterprise High School and 18 deaths statewide, which was found to be an over-estimation. It was the first killer tornado at a US school since the Grand Isle, Louisiana tornado in 1993, and the deadliest tornado-related school disaster since one in Belvidere, Illinois in 1967. One other death was reported in Enterprise at a nearby private residence when a woman's living room window was shattered by the tornado.|$|E
5|$|St John's Church {{was built}} in 1769 by Edward Byrom, a co-founder of the first bank in Manchester. Its parish {{encompassed}} a large and important <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Manchester. The first rector, John Clowes, held the office for 62 years {{until his death in}} 1831. Clowes preached the first Sunday school sermon in the Manchester area, introduced Swedenborgianism there and was prominent in championing Whit Walks. Clowes was succeeded by William Huntington, who had held the post of curate since 1826 and continued as rector until his death in 1874. Huntington established the Sunday school, for which he laid the foundation stone in 1827. In 1906, around 250 children attended the Sunday school and the church had numerous affiliated groups, such as a Penny Bank and a Choral Society. By the early 1900s, the graveyard was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse built on the Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence, and with a declining congregation and some redundancy of provision given the nearby St Matthew's Church, the Manchester diocese decided to merge the parish of St John's with St Matthew's in 1927. As a result, the church was demolished in 1931.|$|E

Wright Street passes through residential neighborhoods east of CR550 before meeting Presque Isle Avenue.
