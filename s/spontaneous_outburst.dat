40|$|A {{physical}} {{mechanism that}} drives FU Orionis-type outbursts is reconsidered. We study {{the effect of}} inner part of a circumstellar disk covering a region from near the central star to the radius of approximately 5 AU (hereafter, the inner disk). Using the fluctuated mass accretion rate onto the inner disk Ṁ_ out, we consider the viscous evolution of the inner disk and the time variability of the mass accretion rate onto the central star Ṁ_ in by means of numerical calculation of an unsteady viscous accretion disk in a one-dimensional axisymmetric model. First, we calculate {{the evolution of the}} inner disk assuming an oscillating Ṁ_ out. It is shown that the time variability of Ṁ_ in does not coincide with Ṁ_ out due to viscous diffusion. Second, we investigate the properties of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>outbursts</b> with temporally constant Ṁ_ out. Outburst occur only in a limited range of mass accretion rates onto the inner disk 10 ^- 10 <Ṁ_ out< 3 × 10 ^- 6 M_ yr^- 1 due to gravo-magneto limit cycle (GML). Finally, we discuss the case with a combination of episodic Ṁ_ out and accretion outbursts cause by the GML in the inner disk. The GML can drive accretion outbursts onto the star even for the case of fluctuating Ṁ_ out, although fluctuations of Ṁ decay during transmitting the inner disk inwards. We newly identified two modes of <b>outburst</b> which are <b>spontaneous</b> one and stimulated one. In a stimulated mode of outburst, Ṁ_ out does appear directly in Ṁ_ in (the latter defining the stellar accretion luminosity).

40|$|Context. The compact {{radio and}} {{near-infrared}} (NIR) source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) {{associated with the}} supermassive black hole in the Galactic center was observed at 7 mm {{in the context of}} a NIR triggered global Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) campaign. Aims. Sgr A* shows variable flux densities ranging from radio through X-rays. These variations sometimes appear in <b>spontaneous</b> <b>outbursts</b> that are referred to as flares. Multi-frequency observations of Sgr A* provide access to easily observable parameters that can test the currently accepted models that try to explain these intensity outbursts. Methods. On May 16 - 18, 2012 Sgr A* has been observed with the VLBA at 7 mm (43 GHz) for 6 hours each day during a global multi-wavelength campaign. These observations were triggered by a NIR flare observed at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Accurate flux densities and source morphologies were acquired. Results. The total 7 mm flux of Sgr A* shows only minor variations during its quiescent states on a daily basis of 0. 06 Jy. An observed NIR flare on May 17 was followed 4. 5 hours later by an increase in flux density of 0. 22 Jy at 43 GHz. This agrees well with the expected time delay of events that are casually connected by adiabatic expansion. Shortly before the peak of the radio flare, Sgr A* developed a secondary radio off-core feature at 1. 5 mas toward the southeast. Even though the closure phases are too noisy to place actual constraints on this feature, a component at this scale together with a time delay of 4. 5 +- 0. 5 hours between the NIR and radio flare provide evidence for an adiabatically expanding jet feature...|$|R

5000|$|... "The socio-religious {{revolution}} or renaissance {{which took}} place in India in the nineteenth century is generally known for its three facets: the change in Indian thought current under the hypnotic impact of the West; a positive leaning towards puritanic revivalism as a reaction to the influx of western ideas; and a deliberate attempt at synthesis of the Oriental and the Occidental. But besides these currents, there was one more - a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>outburst</b> of an inner urge of the Spirit, which was far away from any external influence whatsoever. The father of this spiritual renaissance was Soamiji Maharaj, the founder of the Radhasoami Faith, who started his teachings as early as the twenties of the nineteenth century. Whatever he said or wrote was the outcome of his intuitive realization and mystic revelations. Under this spiritual impulse he could draw a super-sensitive and English educated disciple like Hazur Maharaj towards him. The devotion of the disciple for the Master was matchless in form and precedence. And it was on his repeated requests that Soamiji Maharaj founded this esoteric faith in 1861. The chief characteristics of this faith are love and devotion. It revitalized the medieval Bhakti trends and revived the ancient Guru traditions. The faith presents a new concept of the Supreme Being, a novel revelation of the name [...] "Radhasoami" [...] and introduces a well-defined and developed method of internal practice -- surat-shabd-yoga—to the seekers after Truth. Not only an ascetic but also a man living in family can practise this Yoga. The faith has many other spiritual observances and a well spelled code of moral conduct to be followed by devotees. The faith owes its systematization to the second guru, Rai Saligram Bahadur (Hazur Maharaj), who was its real architect. The Radhasoami Faith has made a remarkable contribution in the socio-religion field as well. The founder gurus of the faith made direct hit upon the prevalent malpractices and anomalies in the indigenous socio-religious beliefs. They advocated for steady and gradual reforms in Indian society and simplified religion so as to make it accessible to all who desire salvation from worldly bondage, without any distinction of caste, colour and nationality." ...|$|E

[...] "It is a classic in its ascetical unction and perfect in its artistic style" [...] (Hamm, [...] "Die Schönheit der kath. Moral", Munich-Gladbach, 1911, p. 74). In four books it treats of the interior spiritual life in imitation of Jesus Christ. It pictures the struggle which man must wage against his inordinate passions and perverse inclinations, the indulgence of which sullies his conscience and robs him of God's grace: [...] "Vanity of vanities and all is vanity, except to love God and serve Him alone" [...] (Vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas præter amare Deum et illi soli servire: I, i). It advises mortification and self-denial as the most efficacious weapons in this struggle. It teaches man to establish God's kingdom in his soul by the practice of virtues according to the example of Jesus Christ. It finally leads him to union with Christ by exciting love for him as well as by pointing out the frailty of all creatures: [...] "It is necessary to leave the beloved thing for the beloved, because Jesus wishes to be loved above all things" [...] (Oportet dilectum propter dilectum relinquere, quia Jesus vult solus super omnia amari: II, xvii). The thoughts of the [...] "Imitation" [...] are thrown into epigrams so simple that they are within the mental grasp of all. Though the book betrays that the author was well versed not only in Scholastic philosophy and theology, but also in the secrets of the mystical life, yet this fact never obtrudes itself on the reader, nor does it obscure the meaning of the contents. A number of quotations from the great doctors Augustine, Bernard, Bonaventure and Thomas, from Aristotle, Ovid and Seneca do not mar the impression that the whole work is the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>outburst</b> of an intensely glowing soul. It has often been said that the teachings of the [...] "Imitation" [...] are [...] "unworldly" [...] and show little appreciation for science, but one must take into consideration the peculiar circumstances of the time: Scholasticism had entered on a period of decline and had lost itself in intricate subtleties; mysticism had gone astray; all classes had been more or less infected with the spirit of licentiousness; conditions like these are the key to interpret phrases such as the following: [...] "I would rather feel compunction than know how to define it" [...] (Opto magis sentire compunctionem quam scire ejus definitionem) or [...] "This is the highest wisdom: through contempt of the world to strive for the kingdom of heaven" [...] (Ista est summa sapientia: per contemptum mundi tendere ad regna coelestia).|$|E
5000|$|When de Cerralbo {{resigned}} as Jefe Delegado in 1899 {{there were many}} personalities counting as his potential successors, including Juan Vázquez de Mella, Tirso de Olazábal, conde de Melgar, Romualdo Cesáreo Sanz Escartin, marqués de Valde-Espina, Joaquín Lloréns or Manuel Polo y Peyrolón. Despite Olazábal having been rumored to get the post, Carlos VII opted for Matías Barrio. As {{at that time the}} conservative and liberal press was widely speculating about another Carlist war approaching, the appointment of a “notorious legalist” and “conciliator” Barrio might have been interpreted as calming the waters, though actual intentions of the claimant remain rather unclear. Barrio did not manage to prevent isolated and probably <b>spontaneous</b> <b>outbursts</b> of Carlist insurgency, especially the 1900 Badalona uprising dubbed [...] "La Octubrada". As unlike many Carlist personalities Barrio was spared the resulting governmental repressive action, his primary task turned out to be reconstruction of the party, suffering from closures of circulos, suspension of periodicals and exile of its leaders. The reopening of circulos produced their visible reformatting, with increased female presence and more focus on youth, including sport (especially football). The resumption of press activities produced a conflict with de Mella, already averse towards Barrio, as the claimant ordered his Jefe Delegado to purge El Correo Español of the Mellista influence.In the early 20th century Matías Barrio was already suffering from leukemia, which was gradually taking its toll. In 1903 the claimant intended to relieve him of some duties by forming Junta Central with Barrio as president, but the body seemed inept and was dissolved after half a year. During the last years of his activity Barrio kept focusing on building a strong parliamentary minority. Except Navarre, where thanks to Barrio’s conciliatory strategy towards Integristas the Traditionalists gained almost a monopoly in political representation, in other regions of Spain these efforts remained rather fruitless. Ready to take the blame Barrio submitted his resignation, which was rejected by Carlos VII. His endeavours were finally crowned two years before death, in the 1907 elections, as the Traditionalists, mostly thanks to joining Solidaritat Catalana, recorded their largest electoral success so far and gained 16 mandates in the Cortes, the result bettered only once, 26 years later.|$|R

An ethnic conflict only occurs when a critical number of people have made the calculated decision to pursue their goals with violent means (Wolff 2007 : 6). Such a decision is part of a longer history of political organizing along ethnic lines. This longer process can be called ‘ethnic mobilization’; leaders decide to speak for ‘their’ ethnic group, thereby making the abstract idea of ethnic belonging a somewhat more tangible reality, and engage the members of this group into political action. This doesn’t mean that such mobilization inevitably leads to violence; as Rogers Brubaker and David Laitin (1998 : 424) have argued, ‘measured against the universe of possible instances, actual instances of ethnic and nationalist violence remain rare’. In many cases ethnic mobilization firmly remains within the limits of peaceful democratic political competition (Habyarimana 2008). Neither does it mean that the grievances invoked by such political action are not deeply felt by the population prior to the process of mobilization, or that the population is not genuinely or spontaneously angered by ‘the ethnic other’. But the step from grievances to ethnic strife should never simply be regarded as an automatic linear chain from cause to consequence; ethnic mobilization is a complex, multidirectional and not necessarily convergent or coherent process. Therefore, it needs careful examination. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to present a brief and non-exhaustive overview of recent thinking and research on ethnic mobilization in the social sciences. I will do this in three sections. The first will define the term mobilization and situate the literature on ethnic mobilization within the larger body of scholarly inquiry on political mobilization and social movements. The second part will consider the main theoretical strands in the study of ethnic mobilization. Here I will distinguish between culturalist, reactive, competition and institutionalist perspectives. And finally, in the brief third section, which also functions as a conclusion to the paper, I will explore the question of differentiated outcomes: what factors account for the radicalization of ethnic claims and the turn from ethnic mobilization to ethnic violence?nrpages: 18 status: publishe...|$|R
60|$|The poet, recalling how Rafael when {{he would}} all-express his love, wrote sonnets to the loved one, and how Dante {{prepared}} to paint an angel for Beatrice, draws the conclusion {{that there is no}} artist but longs to give expression to his supreme love in some other art than his own which would be the medium of a <b>spontaneous,</b> natural <b>outburst</b> of feeling in a way impossible in the familiar forms of his own art. Thus he would gain a man's joy and miss the artist's sorrow, for, like the miracles of Moses, the work of the artist is subject to the cold criticism of the world, which expects him nevertheless always to be the artist, and has no sympathy for him as a man. Since there is no other art but poetry in which it is possible for Browning to express himself, he will at least drop his accustomed dramatic form and speak in his own person; though it be poor, let it stand as a symbol for all-expression. Yet does she not know him, for he has shown her his soul-side as one might imagine the moon showing another side to a mortal lover, which would remain forever as much a mystery to the outside world as the vision seen by Moses, etc. Similarly, he has admired the side his moon of poets has shown the whole world in her poetry, but he blesses himself with the thought of the other side which he alone has seen.|$|R
