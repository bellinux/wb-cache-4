Other topics discussed include: the body reference in abstraction, the <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>titles,</b> and the relation between modern self/world.

5000|$|The Man'yōshū (extra=literally [...] "Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves", but see Name below) is {{the oldest}} {{existing}} collection of Japanese poetry, compiled sometime after 759 AD during the Nara period.

The compiler, or the last in a series of compilers, is today widely believed to be Ōtomo no Yakamochi, although numerous other theories have been proposed. The last datable poem in the collection is from AD 759 (#4516).

Chapter 1 considers the <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> Rossetti's sonnet-sequence The House of Life. Chapter 2 looks at the opening sonnets of that sequence. Chapter 3 scrutinises the sonnet quartet of the Willow-wood sequence. Chapter 4 evaluates the influence of Platonism and Neoplatonism in Rossetti's art. Chapter 5 is concerned with Rossetti's use of allegory. Chapter 6 surveys the influence of Rosicrucianism on Rossetti and his immediate circle of the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and on the Aesthetic School that succeeded it. This chapter closely {{examines the}} symbolic motifs of Rosicrucianism, and how these may be traced in the paintings of these artists. Chapter 7 explores the Rosicrucian influence in Rossetti's poetry. Chapter 8 further traces these influences in Rossetti's painting.

40|$|Conference paper. 'Art Out of Time', Institute of Visual Research, University of Oxford. The {{exhibition}} Raid the Icebox (1969) was {{a pioneering}} engagement with institutional collection-holding in which Andy Warhol negotiated the conflicting practices and sensibilities that still impact on artists {{working at the}} interface of contemporary art and traditional museum display. Framed by the trope of liberating frozen material from the museum store, Warhol’s ‘icebox raid’ now stands as a seminal example of historic art objects serving as installation material in a contemporary art exhibition. In an academic world dominated by theories of embodied meaning and environmental crisis, the <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> Warhol’s <b>title</b> is surely on-going. The aim was to bring stored artworks {{into the light of}} day and, within Warhol’s conceit of liberation, the notion of refrigeration operates alongside the metaphor of darkness as a key representation of the non-compliant and non-contemporaneous character of the museum environment...|$|R

40|$|In {{the second}} half of the 16 th century, after the {{definitive}} Turkish conquest of Constantinople, the titulus of Constantine came to be perceived in a fundamentally new way within the design to reaffirm papal authority, culminating in the pontificate of Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini. Diplomatic wrangling and the strategic plan to save Byzantium in the West in the two decades after the fall of Constantinople had and would have had the precise aim of reinstating the hereditary <b>title</b> <b>of</b> the Byzantine Caesars, transferred to the East by Constantine and never extinguished, within the orbit of papal influence. The seat of Peter and the sceptre of Eastern Christianity should have been symbolically reunited in the ‘New Byzantium,’ which would have had its base at Rome and its bridgehead at Mystras. The project failed also because its main supporters died one after the other within a short period of time. But during the decades when it was pursued, we witness a true revival of the figure of Constantine and an accentuation of the symbolic primacy and legal <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> his <b>title</b> in the deliberations and political actions of humanist intellectuals, and their reflection in the artistic commissions of the period...|$|R
