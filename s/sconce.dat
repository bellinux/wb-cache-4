5|$|Zutphen {{was secured}} for the Spanish, {{though in the}} {{following}} weeks the English managed to capture a major Spanish fort, Zutphen's <b>sconce,</b> {{on the bank of}} the IJssel river opposite the town. Most of the English gains were negated when, months later, the English governors of Deventer and Zutphen's <b>sconce</b> defected to the Spanish ranks and handed over their places to Farnese.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 1603 recorded that Upnor Castle had 20 guns of various calibres, plus another 11 guns split between two sconces or outworks, known as Bay and Warham Sconces. The castle's armament {{consisted of a}} demi-cannon, 7 culverin, 5 demi-culverin, a minion, a falconet, a saker, and four fowlers with two chambers each. Bay <b>Sconce</b> was armed with 4 demi-culverin, while Warham <b>Sconce</b> had 2 culverin and 5 demi-culverin. Eighteen guns were recorded as being mounted in the castle twenty years later. The garrison's armament included 34 longbows, an indication that archery was still of military value even at this late date. By this time, however, the castle {{was in a state}} of disrepair. The drawbridge and its raising mechanism were broken, the gun platforms needed repairs, and the courtyard wall had collapsed. A new curtain wall had to be built to protect the landward side of the castle. The foundations of Warham <b>Sconce</b> were reported to have been washed away by the tide, and it appears that both sconces were allowed to fall into ruin.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October, for {{the third}} time, Farnese {{supplied}} the garrison of Zutphen, personally, {{as he had done}} the first time. Later on, he sent Verdugo back to Friesland and left Johann Baptista von Taxis in charge of Zutphen. After that, the Spanish army took its winter quarters. When Farnese moved to Brussels to spend the winter there, the Earl of Leicester continued the siege of Zutphen. He was not able to take the town, but succeeded in occupying several forts beyond the IJssel, including Zutphen's <b>sconce,</b> which was carried by surprise by Edward Stanley, brother of William Stanley, and 12 other soldiers. Shortly after the English and Dutch also took their winter quarters. Sir William Stanley was given the command of Deventer, Sir John Burroughs of Doesburg, and Rowland York of Zutphen's <b>sconce.</b> Stanley and York's appointments were met with suspicion by the Dutch States, because Stanley was openly Catholic and York a man of dissolute character. Leicester expressed his full confidence in both soldiers, but in 1587 Stanley and York shifted sides to the Spanish party and handed Deventer and Zutphen's <b>sconce</b> over to Taxis.|$|E

5|$|In 1628 {{the castle}} site was {{granted by the}} Crown to Giles Clutterbuck; the local gentry complained, leading to a legal {{case in which the}} county {{successfully}} reclaimed the site. In 1642 England descended into a period of civil war between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. Worcester's city walls were refortified and a <b>sconce,</b> or small fort, was built on top of the motte of Worcester Castle.|$|E

5|$|Stanley and York's acts {{not only}} negated the gains of the 1586 campaign, but also {{undermined}} Leicester's reputation and the Dutch States {{confidence in the}} English troops. The Dutch States decided to appoint Count Maurice of Nassau as Governor-General of the Netherlands and Philip of Hohenlohe as his lieutenant. With the loss of Deventer and Zutphen's <b>sconce,</b> the Spanish were able to levy war contributions in the provinces of Utrecht, Overijssel and Gelderland. Zutphen and Deventer remained in Spanish control until their capture in 1591 by Maurice of Nassau.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War in the 1640s the old medieval {{walls were}} {{reinforced}} with modern earthwork bastions and an outlying fort, called a <b>sconce.</b> Worcester changed hands {{several times during}} the conflict, and after the war ended the newer fortifications were dismantled. During the 18th century the older medieval stone walls and gatehouses were sold and mostly destroyed: by the 20th century, few parts survived. Post-war archaeology in the 1950s and 1960s and construction work in the 1970s revealed previously hidden stretches of the wall, and in the 21st century plans have been drawn up to improve the conservation and maintenance of this historic monument.|$|E
5|$|When Farnese besieged Rheinberg in September 1586, Leicester's army marched towards Zutphen {{and took}} a Spanish <b>sconce</b> on the left bank of the IJssel river. On 18 September Leicester laid a pontoon bridge over the IJssel and took {{positions}} on the right bank of the river, thus encircling Zutphen. Leicester's Anglo-Dutch army consisted of 8,000 infantry– mainly English and Scottish, but also 1,400 Irish– and 3,000 cavalry. Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, led the cavalry, John Norreys the infantry and William Pelham the camp, in which Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, the deposed Archbishop of Cologne, and Manuel, son of the Prior of Crato, claimant to the Portuguese crown, all resided.|$|E

5|$|In 1642 the English Civil War {{broke out}} between the Royalist {{supporters}} of Charles I and those of Parliament. South Wales was predominantly Royalist in sympathy, and during the conflict, a <b>sconce,</b> or small fort, was built overlooking Caerphilly Castle to the north-west, {{on the site of}} the old Roman fort. It is uncertain if this was built by Royalist forces or by the Parliamentary army that occupied the area during the final months of the war in March 1646, but the fort's guns would have dominated the interior of the castle. It is also uncertain whether or not Caerphilly Castle was deliberately slighted by Parliament to prevent its future use as a fortification. Although several towers had collapsed by the 18th century, possibly as a result of such an operation, it is probable that this deterioration was actually the result of subsidence damage caused when the water defences retreated, as there is no evidence of deliberate destruction having been ordered.|$|E
5|$|The Royalist {{commander}} Prince Maurice conscripted {{the adult}} {{men and women}} of Worcester to work on the walls, threatening the death penalty if they did not attend. To form these new defences, the buildings outside the old city walls were cleared and six large bastions were attached to them along the north and east sides of the city, while a <b>sconce,</b> Fort Royal Hill was built outside Sidbury Gate in the south, linked to the walls by a walkway. The ditch protecting the new earthworks was relatively shallow at about eight feet (2.4 m) deep, but when combined with the high ramparts of the bastions, which were probably protected by sharpened stakes and a banquette firing platform, the bastions would have been well defended. During the short unsuccessfully siege 1643 and the long successful siege of 1646 the reinforced defences were able to withstand the artillery bombardments – the surrender in 1646 was mainly the result of a shortage of food and the collapse of the wider Royalist position across the south-west of England.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{pressure}} on the Spanish infantry, the Marquis del Vasto collected his cavalry and charged over Stanley's infantry, being in turn repelled. He was nearly killed when an English soldier attacked him with a battleaxe, but a Spanish light horseman surnamed Arenas saved him by transfixing the English with his lance. Del Vasto retired from the fight and met Verdugo and Johann Baptista von Taxis, who sallied from Zutphen with several troops to join the battle. At the same time they were conversing, English troops unsuccessfully attacked Zutphen's <b>sconce</b> {{on the other side of}} the IJssel, which was defended by Count Herman van den Bergh with some men. For a moment, Verdugo thought that the skirmish was inside Zutphen and the town burghers had risen in arms against the few Spanish troops he had left behind the walls. Leicester committed the same mistake, believing that the Frisons under Count William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg were fighting against the Spanish inside Zutphen.|$|E

25|$|Fort de Kock was a 19th-century Dutch <b>sconce</b> {{fortification}} established over a hill in Bukittinggi, West Sumatra, Indonesia.

25|$|As Maurice had his {{soldiers}} motivated {{to construct a}} <b>sconce,</b> the Anglo-Dutch force was sufficiently entrenched {{by the beginning of}} May.

Mansfeld in desperation even called upon his son, Karl von Mansfeld, with his detachment in France to assist his own army but this was to no avail.|$|E
25|$|On July 21 Parma soon {{surrounded}} {{and then}} laid siege to the <b>sconce</b> of Knodsenburg.
