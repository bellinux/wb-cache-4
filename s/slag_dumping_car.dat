A concrete weir and foundations of a pump house are situated on the creek. Evidence of the smelter housing precinct lies across the creek from the <b>slag</b> <b>dump.</b> One family house survives in situ.

40|$|A {{deterministic}} {{mathematical model}} for ecosystem development on <b>slag</b> <b>dumps</b> has been formulated based on five {{components of the}} ecosystem—soil total nitrogen, plant biomass, plant cover, soil mois-ture, litter, and soil fine particles. Nitrogen and soil moisture, which regulate vegetation development on the <b>slag</b> <b>dumps,</b> {{have been used as}} the driving parameters of the model. The numerical results obtained from the model were compared with the field values estimated in five sites representing an age series of 5 to 40 years. The percentage deviation between the model and field values at the end of 40 years was less than 16 %, except in the case of silt and clay, which was less than 44 %. Unlike earlier published ecosystem models dealing mostly with steady-state systems, this model deals with an ecosystem evolving from a bare and sterile substratum and can be used to predict changes in various components in the <b>slag</b> <b>dump</b> ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the sites that have a pollution potential due to metallurgical activities in Romania. The amount of metallurgical slag generated depends on the steel production (Iluiu- Varvara, 2007). The total quantities of metallurgical slag generated far exceed 200 million tons of slag (Blan, 2010). In (Fig. 1.) is presented the distribution of <b>slag</b> <b>dumps</b> and existing steel plants in Romania. The <b>slag</b> <b>dumps</b> are located inside or near metallurgical plants, representing a permanent source of pollution to the environment Fig. 1.

40|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of appearance and relief evolution in mining areas cannot {{be done without}} mining engineering concepts. Over time, researchers {{around the world have}} responsibly been involved in this matter necessary for the development of society, also with obvious implications and repercussions over the quality of life. The purpose of the scientific research detailed in this paper comprises in monitoring the <b>slag</b> <b>dump</b> from Buituri, Hunedoara County using space geodetic technology. <b>Slag</b> <b>dump</b> is the result of steel production activities carried out under the steel factory Arcelor Mittal Hunedoara S. A., formerly known as the steel factory Hunedoara - Siderurgica S. A. Therefore it was decided to conduct monthly topographic measurements to monitor possible dynamic changes that may appear in the context of continuous exploitation of the above mentioned <b>slag</b> <b>dump.</b> Monitoring possible movements is performed by comparing transversal and longitudinal profiles drawn based on zero measurement carried out on 20. 05. 2011, with the ones obtained after processing of the monthly measurements realized throughout the years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Also, for observing the displacements, comparative charts or tables with records regarding coordinates differences are studied. The issue of measuring and graphic representation of settlements, horizontal linear movements and landslides for structures such as <b>slag</b> or sterile <b>dumps,</b> requires further studies and interdisciplinary research, creating links between specialists in the fields of terrestrial measurements science and geology...|$|R

With time, vegetation redeveloped on these dumps as a result of natural succession. In the ash dump of the “Kosova A” power plant, a total of 125 species were recorded (belonging to 29 families and 93 genera), whereas 72 species (belonging to 24 families and 58 genera) were recorded in the <b>slag</b> <b>dump</b> of the “Ferronikeli” smelter. Twenty-eight species were recorded in both locations. In the old parts of the ash dump of the “Kosova A” power plant, plants had established communities where three plant associations were recorded (Echio-Melilotetum Tx. 1942, Bromo-Sambucetum ebuli Br. -Bl. and Sisymbrio-Diplotaxidietum tenuifolia). The process of vegetation development at the ash disposal site indicates that natural colonisation had established the plant communities, which will provide protection against erosion and dust dispersion by wind...|$|R

In 1897, a single-track trestle and viaduct was built on this site; in 1918, the original piers were doubled in width, the current double-tracked structure built alongside, and then slid into place.

50|$|The {{vicinity}} of the smelter has been severely impacted on by drilling rigs and the 1970s mining activities.

Carefully pouring the slag, so that it retained a smooth top, ensured that the hot slag could be moved rapidly across the dump as required.

50|$|In 1907 the Huntingdon-Heberlein {{process plant}} was erected {{at a cost}} of £60,000. Extensive {{excavations}} were done and rails laid to ore bins on the hill opposite the main smelters. The process flow involved - rock breaker, converter kettles for 12 hours desulphurising process, then to the lead furnaces. A new electric plant was also installed.A new lead furnace was blown in on 21 January 1908. However in 1908 there was hardly a mine operating outside of the company mines as an outcome of wage increases with the emergence of unions and declining copper prices. The new copper furnace was blown in on 20 February 1908 and the converter plant was operating effectively by early March that year. Much better lead recoveries were noticeable after the second converter was introduced into the line, and ores had to be preliminarily roasted as well. At a cost of £70,000 the Chillagoe Railway and Mines Company Pty Limited could treat sulphide ores from its Mungana mines as well as public ore. They could also treat the Penzance (Redcap), Boomerang (Calcifer) and Calcifer <b>slag</b> <b>dump</b> material, along with self-fluxing mixture with Ruddygore ore. To achieve this the company had to extend its tramline from the Chillagoe railway at Harper Siding to the Boomerang and Calcifer <b>slag</b> <b>dump.</b>|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{reclamation}} interventions of post-smelting <b>slag</b> <b>dumps</b> being undertaken so far either failed or produced poor results. Certain lichens, {{especially of}} the genus Cladonia, are known as effective colonisers of bare ground in anthropogenic habitats. The paper presents preliminary results of the experiment aimed at the evaluation of lichen usefulness in reclamation interventions. The cultivation in vivo involving transplantation of lichens directly on slag substrate was established in 2015. Five species, i. e. Cladonia rei, C. cariosa, C. pyxidata, C. subulata, C. macilenta, were transplanted into 32 cuvettes filled with sterilised slag substrate. The sample weight of 2 and 6 g were used and half of cuvettes were regularly supplied with 2 % malt solution. The first important symptoms at the present stage of the experiment are as follow: the growth of thalli has appeared only {{in the case of}} first three species; C. rei shows the most effective development; cuvettes with 6 g sample weight are characterized by higher coverage of fresh lichen thalli; lichen biomass are visually higher in cuvettes treated with malt solution. The results give us reason to believe that lichens could be successfully used as an alternative element during planning of <b>slag</b> <b>dumps</b> reclamation in the future...|$|R
