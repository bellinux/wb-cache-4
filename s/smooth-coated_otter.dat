5|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to the present species, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The giant otter shares the South American continent with three of the four members of the New World Lontra genus of otters: the neotropical river otter, the southern river otter, and the marine otter. (The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) is the fourth Lontra member.) The giant otter seems to have evolved independently of Lontra in South America, despite the overlap. The <b>smooth-coated</b> <b>otter</b> (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted. Both species also show strong pair bonding and paternal engagement in rearing cubs.|$|E
2500|$|The Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve is {{situated}} in the flood plains of the Saptkoshi River in the eastern Terai. It covers an area of [...] comprising grasslands and khair–sissoo riverine forests. It was established in 1976 and was declared a Ramsar site in 1987. The reserve provides habitat for hog deer, spotted deer, wild pig, blue bull, gaur, <b>smooth-coated</b> <b>otter,</b> jackal, 485 bird species including 114 water bird species, 200 fish species, 24 reptile and 11 amphibian species. The last surviving population of wild water buffalo in Nepal {{is found in the}} reserve, as well as gharial, Gangetic dolphin, swamp francolin and rufous-vented prinia. A small population of the critically endangered Bengal florican is present along the Kosi River. There are also records of white-throated bush chat and Finn's weaver. The bristled grassbird breeds in the reserve. The reserve together with the Koshi Barrage was identified as one of 27 Important Bird Areas of Nepal.|$|E
2500|$|A similar {{situation}} {{is found in}} the lower Gangetic Plain, which includes the lower Brahmaputra River. The lower plains contain more open forests, which tend to be dominated by Bombax ceiba in association with Albizzia procera, Duabanga grandiflora, and Sterculia vilosa. There are early seral forest communities that would eventually become dominated by the climax species sal (Shorea robusta), if forest succession was allowed to proceed. In most places forests fail to reach climax conditions due to human causes. The forests of the lower Gangetic Plain, despite thousands of years of human settlement, remained largely intact until the early 20th century. Today only about 3% of the ecoregion is under natural forest and only one large block, south of Varanasi, remains. There are over forty protected areas in the ecoregion, but over half of these are less than [...] The fauna of the lower Gangetic Plain is similar to the upper plains, {{with the addition of a}} number of other species such as the <b>smooth-coated</b> <b>otter</b> (Lutrogale perspicillata) and the large Indian civet (Viverra zibetha).|$|E

2500|$|There are 10 {{recorded}} {{species of}} mammals inhabiting the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area. The Asian Small-Clawed Otter (Aonyx cinerea) [...] and the <b>Smooth-coated</b> <b>Otter</b> (Lutra perspicillata) are {{both on the}} IUCN Red List as Vulnerable species and Fishing Cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) is presently listed as Endangered. Aonyx cinerea are considered ‘bioindicators’ of wetland ecosystems, therefore declining populations within Thale Noi are concerning and indicates deteriorating ecological conditions that threatens the biodiversity of the entire ecosystem. The most significant threat to these species are the loss of habitat and population fragmentation due to land conversion into rice paddies and shrimp farms (Mukherjees et al. 2010). [...] Over-fishing and trapping may {{also contribute to the}} declining Fishing Cat population in the region, due to a reduction of food availability and increased risk of being killed by farmers protecting their stock or being sold in the illegal pet trade. A recent study in 2013 [...] found that Fishing Cats in the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area were almost completely nocturnal, making recording individual numbers difficult to establish.|$|E

Evidence is accumulating that animals are indeed selective and adopt ‘social learning strategies’. However, studies have generally focused on fish, bird and primate species. Here we extend research on social learning strategies to a taxonomic group that has been neglected until now: otters (subfamily Lutrinae). We collected social association data on captive groups of two gregarious species: <b>smooth-coated</b> <b>otters</b> (Lutrogale perspicillata), known to hunt fish cooperatively in the wild, and Asian short clawed otters (Aonyx cinereus), which feed individually on prey requiring extractive foraging behaviours.

We show that <b>smooth-coated</b> <b>otters</b> can socially learn how to exploit novel food sources and may adopt a ‘copy when young’ strategy.

40|$|Abstract: A pair of <b>Smooth-coated</b> <b>otters</b> was sighted {{in remote}} {{temperate}} {{parts of the}} Nyamjang Chu valley (Chu = River) in westernmost part of Tawang district, Arunachal Pradesh on 1 st April 2014. The otters were photographed basking on a riverside rock and identified based on their morphological features. There were no previously published records of Smooth-coated Otters; normally a species found more in plains, from western Arunachal Pradesh and {{the state as a}} whole has very scanty information regarding presence and distribution of otters. The sighting signifies the rich biodiversity of Nyamjang Chu, in Pangchen valley and implies initiation of strong conservation measures to safeguard the future of the otters...|$|R
