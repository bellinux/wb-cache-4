40|$|Sustaining {{life with}} total {{automation}} {{is a difficult}} problem for GAS canisters. The length of time between setting the experiment and flight, the conditions of a completely <b>sealed</b> <b>container,</b> <b>no</b> guarantee on launch delay, orientation {{and the possibility of}} contamination all tend to exclude experiments with living matter. This experiment examines the growth of a nontoxic, everyday fungus, Phycomyces, in a microgravity environment. Data from this experiment will help define the mechanism by which plants determine the direction of gravity. The bioengineering problems were solved only after numerous tests and design changes. Phycomyces normally have a shelf life of approximately one week. Storing the fungus for two months, activating the fungus for growth and precise timing were the major obstacles. Solutions were found for storage by drying the fungus spores onto pieces of filter paper. Activation occurs when this filter paper is dropped onto the growth medium, via a solenoid system. The problem of timing is partially solved by growing more than one chamber of the fungus at different time intervals. This experiment proves that the simpler a design, the better it works...|$|R
50|$|Containerization has lowered {{shipping}} {{expense and}} decreased shipping time, {{and this has}} in turn helped the growth of international trade. Cargo that once arrived in cartons, crates, bales, barrels or bags now comes in factory <b>sealed</b> <b>containers,</b> with <b>no</b> indication to the human eye of their contents, except for a product code that machines can scan and computers trace. This system of tracking has been so exact that a two-week voyage can be timed for arrival with an accuracy of under fifteen minutes. It has resulted in such revolutions as on time guaranteed delivery and just in time manufacturing. Raw materials arrive from factories in <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> {{less than an hour}} before they are required in manufacture, resulting in reduced inventory expense.|$|R
50|$|Lord Tomlin concurred with Lord Buckmaster. While {{he agreed}} with Lord Atkin that the duty of care a {{manufacturer}} owed to its consumers was the same regardless of the product they produced, he held that no general duty of care existed and that the fact the product was in a <b>sealed</b> <b>container</b> made <b>no</b> difference to the finding of a such duty. He further endorsed concerns that Lord Atkin's broader test of liability would have allowed everyone injured in the Versailles rail accident {{to be able to}} claim compensation from the manufacturer of the axle that broke and caused the crash.|$|R
40|$|The associated-particle sealed-tube neutron {{generator}} (APSTNG) interrogates the inspected {{object with}} 14 -MeV neutrons from d-t reaction and detects the alpha-particle {{associated with each}} neutron inside a cone encompassing the region of interest. Gamma-ray spectra from resulting neutron reactions inside the inspected volume identify fissionable materials and many nuclides. Flight times from detection times of the gamma rays and alpha particles separate the prompt and delayed gamma-ray spectra and can yield coarse tomographic images from a single orientation. The high-energy neutrons and gamma rays penetrate large objects and dense materials. The gamma-ray detector and neutron generator {{can be on the}} same side of the interrogated objects, so walls and other confined areas can be inspected as well as <b>sealed</b> <b>containers.</b> <b>No</b> collimators or radiation shielding are needed. The neutron generator is simple and small. Commercial electronics are used. A complete system could be transported in a van. Laboratory and limited field tests indicate APSTNG could be useful in analyzing radioactive waste in drums, walls, soils, and processing systems, particularly for unknown or heterogeneous configurations that may attenuate radiation. Toxic chemicals could be identified in mixed waste, and the ability to detect pockets of water may address criticality concerns...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{solution to the}} problem is to have two joined flywheels spinning synchronously in opposite directions. They would have a total angular momentum of zero and no gyroscopic effect. A problem with this solution is that when the difference between the momentum of each flywheel is anything other than zero the housing of the two flywheels would exhibit torque. Both wheels must be maintained at the same speed to keep the angular velocity at zero. Strictly speaking, the two flywheels would exert a huge torqueing moment at the central point, trying to bend the axle. However, if the axle were sufficiently strong, no gyroscopic forces would have a net effect on the <b>sealed</b> <b>container,</b> so <b>no</b> torque would be noticed.|$|R

40|$|The {{safe storage}} of pure and impure {{plutonium}} oxide materials in <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> is a current Department of Energy (DOE) concern. Plutonium oxides sorb {{moisture from the}} atmosphere, and the subsequent radiolytic and/or chemical decomposition of the water has been thought to generate excessive hydrogen pressures inside <b>sealed</b> <b>containers.</b> Eleven <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> with ten grams each of plutonium oxide materials have been studied for up to four years. The sealed materials were representative materials from the DOE complex and contain less than 0. 5 weight percent water. The samples were kept at ambient conditions. We report the final gas analysis of the headspace gas of these containers using gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and Raman spectroscopy. The results show {{that none of the}} containers have pressurized significantly, and that hydrogen was not generated in significant quantities...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion and pitting {{have been}} {{observed}} in headspace regions of stainless steel containers enclosing plutonium oxide/salt mixtures.

5000|$|If {{a liquid}} in a <b>sealed</b> <b>container</b> is boiled, the {{pressure}} inside the container increases.
