In the early 20th century the population was still overwhelmingly black: African Americans outnumbered whites {{in the area around}} Elaine by a ten-to-one ratio, and by three-to-one in the county overall. Descendants of slaves, most blacks worked as sharecroppers.

40|$|When {{the project}} is {{certified}} to be practically completed the contractor will be entitled to be paid the final payment. There {{are a lot of}} criticism regarding the final account for construction projects that have been settled unreasonably late or far beyond the period stipulated in the contract. This scenario occurs due to the duration to settle the final account by government agencies. The government agencies have failed to prepare the final accounts and final certificates according to the period stated in the condition of contract and the government agencies also failed to release the performance guarantee sum or performance bond within stipulated time. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} identify the problem associated with the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> final <b>account</b> in the government projects and to recommend the solution to the problem related to <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> final <b>account.</b> The scope <b>of</b> this study is limited to government project and government agencies.

From the analysis, it can be summarized that, there are ten (10) serious problems associated with the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> final <b>account.</b> This are listed as variation, price, time, contractor, contract, management matter (contract administrator), human, contractual, client and external factor. There are numerous solutions to resolve these problems that have been identified by the respondents in chapter 5 of the study. Therefore, by conducting this research, hopefully will help the quantity surveyor and contract administrator in identifying the problems in settlement final account and make reasonable actions as soon as possible. This also to enable quantity surveyor to reduce potential conflict in final account settlement and to ensure that the final account and final certificate can be completed in timely manner...|$|R

He had not understood enough of the previous business to be aware of the deterioration of the manner of dealing with it, though he did think it scarcely what he expected.

He had allowed his quality of gentleman to keep him an outsider, instead of using it to raise the general level of the transactions, so that the whole had gone down in the hands of the unscrupulous Goodenough.|$|E

60|$|The very {{outset of}} the career of this {{excellent}} magistrate was distinguished by an example of legal acumen, that gave flattering presage of a wise and equitable administration. The morning {{after he had been}} installed in office, and at the moment that he was making his breakfast from a prodigious earthen dish, filled with milk and Indian pudding, he was interrupted by the appearance of Wandle Schoonhoven, a very important old burgher of New Amsterdam, who complained bitterly of one Barent Bleecker, inasmuch as he refused to come to a <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts,</b> seeing that there was a heavy balance in favor of the said Wandle. Governor Van Twiller, as I have already observed, was a man of few words; he was likewise a mortal enemy to multiplying writings, or being disturbed at his breakfast. Having listened attentively to the statement of Wandle Schoonhoven, giving an occasional grunt, as he shoveled a spoonful of Indian pudding into his mouth--either as a sign that he relished the dish or comprehended the story--he called unto his constable, and pulling out of his breeches proper a huge jack-knife, dispatched it after the defendant as a summons, accompanied by his tobacco box as a warrant.|$|E

He had long been declining, {{and the last thing}} Tom had heard from Lima was, that he was dead; but of the daughter there was no intelligence; Tom had been too much occupied with his own affairs to know anything of her.

He took a night to consider; and, as Louis started at hearing of any deliberation, he said, sadly, 'You would not believe me, my Lord, but I had almost a mind. They would take away my character, any way; and what advantage was my honesty without that? And as to hurting my employers, they would only take what I did not; and such as that is thought nothing of by very many. I'd got no faith in man nor woman left, and I'd got nothing but suspicion by my honesty; so why should I not give in to the way of the world, and try if it would serve me. But then, my Lord, it struck me that if I had nothing else, I had still my God left.' ...|$|E
60|$|Excited by his situation, Ferdinand {{was soon}} tempted to incur {{expenses}} which his income did not justify. The facility of credit afforded him {{not a moment}} to pause; everything he wanted was furnished him; and until the regiment quitted the garrison he was well aware that a <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> was never even desired. Amid this imprudence he was firm, however, in his resolution never to trespass on the resources of his father. It was with difficulty that he even brought himself to draw for the allowance which Sir Ratcliffe insisted on making him; and he would gladly have saved his father from making even this advance, by vague intimations of the bounty of Lord Grandison, had he not feared this conduct might have led to suspicious and disagreeable enquiries. It cannot be denied that his debts occasionally caused him anxiety, {{but they were not}} considerable; he quieted his conscience by the belief that, if he were pressed, his grandfather could scarcely refuse to discharge a few hundred pounds for his favourite grandson; and, at all events, he felt that the ultimate resource of selling his commission was still reserved for him. If these vague prospects did not drive away compunction, the qualms of conscience were generally allayed in the evening assembly, in which his vanity was gratified. At length he paid his first visit to England. That was a happy meeting. His kind father, his dear, dear mother, and the faithful Glastonbury, experienced some of the most transporting moments of their existence, when they beheld, with admiring gaze, the hero who returned to them. Their eyes were never satiated with beholding him; they hung upon his accents. Then came the triumphant visit to Grandison; and then Ferdinand returned to Malta, in the full conviction that he was the heir to fifteen thousand a year.|$|E
