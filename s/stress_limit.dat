40|$|Understanding species {{distribution}} ecology is essential given the growing {{need to understand}} how species will react to climate change and invasion. Understanding the processes by which distribution limits are set is necessary to build accurate distribution models, yet the role of biotic interactions (e. g. competition, predation, disease, parasitism) in determining range limits is uncertain, despite evidence that incorporating biotic information improves the accuracy of these models. By examining the elevational variability of Afromontane, avian range limits across several communities, we add to reports indicating that environmental conditions are generally more important in determining both high and low <b>stress</b> range <b>limits</b> across an environmental gradient. However, we note that biotic interactions may still be more important at low <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> than they are at high <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> and that the processes that limit ranges appear to be different at low and high <b>stress</b> <b>limits.</b> High <b>stress</b> range <b>limits</b> appeared to be much more variable, stimulating new and unexpected questions. We go on to document how distribution limits of avifauna have shifted in two Ugandan national parks. We tentatively conclude that range shifts may have occurred over the last decade, at a rate faster than one would have expected species to move merely based on the warming that has occurred. This indicated that warming may not be the only factor that is causing species’ upper limits to shift upwards in elevation. ...|$|R
40|$|Increasing the <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> at {{release of}} {{prestressing}} has garnered significant interest recently. <b>Stress</b> <b>limits</b> {{are used to}} provide adequate serviceability performance and to prevent premature failure of the materials. As engineers continue {{to push the envelope}} on span length and girder spacing to reduce costs, bridge girders are subjected to increasingly higher levels of stress under service loading. The impact of increasing the <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> at release of prestressing would be {{to increase the amount of}} steel a given section can contain, to reduce or eliminate the need for draping or debonding of strands improving plant safety and to provide faster turn around for precast plants since prestressing could be released at lower concrete strengths. In addition to increasing the <b>stress</b> <b>limits,</b> an increasing number of precast plants would like to be able to reap the benefits of self-consolidating concrete, but are reluctant due to the relatively unknown behavior of the material in prestressing applications. For this program, six reduced scale prestressed concrete girders were cast with targeted release stresses between 60 % and 80 % of the initial concrete compressive strength. Time-dependant prestress losses were measured at regular intervals for 196 days, which was then followed by structural testing to failure. Three of the girders were designed and tested for flexural performance, while the other three were designed and tested for shear performance. This paper reports the results of six shear tests conducted in the Structural Engineering Research Laboratory at Missouri S&T on the high-strength self-consolidating concrete members...|$|R

50|$|In the {{northern}} waters, females often are larger, grow faster, live longer, and mature {{in three to}} four years. Males mature {{in two to three}} years at a smaller size. Perch do not grow as large in {{the northern}} waters, but tend to live longer.(contradicts size in description) Most research has showed the maximum age to be about 9-10 years, with a few living past 11 years. The preferred temperature range for the yellow perch is 17.6 to 25 °C (63 to 77 °F), with an optimum range of 21 to 24 °C (70 to 75 °F) and a lethal limit in upwards of 33 °C (91 °F) and a <b>stress</b> <b>limit</b> over 26 °C (79 °F). Yellow perch spawn once a year in spring using large schools and shallow areas of a lake or low-current tributary streams. They do not build a redd or nest. Spawning typically takes place at night or in the early morning. Females have the potential to spawn up to eight times in their lifetimes.|$|E
40|$|Rapidly applied {{transient}} {{dynamic loads}} produce stresses and deflections in structures that typically exceed those from static loading conditions. Previous acceptance criteria for structures designed for rapidly applied transient dynamic loading <b>limited</b> <b>stresses</b> to those determined from elastic analysis. Different <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> were established for different grades of structure {{depending upon the}} amount of permanent set considered acceptable. Structure allowed to sustain very limited permanent set is designed to <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> not significantly greater than yield stress. Greater permanent set in structure under rapidly applied transient dynamic loading conditions is permitted by establishing <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> that are significantly greater than yield stress but still provide adequate safety margin (with respect to failure). This paper presents a strain-based elastic-plastic (i. e., inelastic) analysis criterion developed {{as an alternative to}} the more conservative stress-based elastic analysis stress criterion for structures subjected to rapidly applied transient dynamic loading. The strain limits established are based on a fraction of the strain at ultimate stress obtained from an engineering stress/strain curve of the material. Strains limits are categorized by type as membrane or surface and by region as general, local, or concentrated. The application of the elastic-plastic criterion provides a more accurate, less conservative design/analysis basis for structures than that used in elastic stress-based analysis criteria, while still providing adequate safety margins...|$|R

50|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{is known}} {{to occur in the}} northern waters where females are often larger, grow faster, live longer, and mature in three to four years. Males mature in two to three years at a smaller size. Perch do not grow as large in the northern waters, but tend to live longer. Maximum age estimates vary widely. The age of the perch is highly based on the condition of the lake. Most research has shown the maximum age to be approximately 9-10 years, with a few living past 11 years. Yellow perch have been proven to grow the best in lakes where they are piscivorous {{due to the lack of}} predators. Perch do not perform well in cold, deep, oligotrophic lakes. Seasonal movements tend to follow the 20 °C isotherm and researchers have concluded water temperature was the most important factor influencing fish distribution. Yellow perch commonly reside in shallow water, but are occasionally found deeper than 15 meters or on the bottom. Their optimum temperature range is 21-24 °C, but have been known to adapt to warmer or cooler habitats. The common lethal limit is 26.5 °C, but some research has shown it to be in upwards of 33 °C with a <b>stress</b> <b>limit</b> at anything over 26 °C. To grow properly, yellow perch prefer a pH of 7 to 8. The tolerable pH ranges have been found to be about 3.9 to 9.5. They also may survive in brackish and saline waters, as well as water with low dissolved oxygen levels.|$|E
