Consumers attempting to discriminate between the brand they are looking for and a look-alike product often have to differentiate products which share a great deal of common context: positioning on the supermarket shelf, the type of store, aspects of the packaging, or brand claims. Trade mark and related laws aim to protect brands and reduce consumer confusion, but courts assessing allegations <b>of</b> trade <b>mark</b> infringement often lack careful empirical evidence concerning the impact of brand and context similarity, and, in the absence of such evidence, make assumptions about how consumers respond to brands that downplay the importance of context and focus on the <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> registered <b>marks.</b> The experiments reported in this paper aimed to test certain common assumptions in trade mark law, providing evidence that shared context can cause mistakes even where brand similarity is low...|$|R

On the other hand, Sita Ram, author of the Vaishnava history of Ayodhya, and George Grierson, eminent linguist and Indologist, represent Ramananda as saint who tried to transcend caste divisions of medieval India through the message of love and equality. The scholars also disagree on Ramananda's connection with Ramanuja. While Farquhar finds them completely unconnected, Sita Ram and Grierson place Ramananda within the Ramanuja tradition.|$|R

40|$|Context. The {{clustering}} {{properties of}} galaxies belonging to different luminosity ranges or having different morphological types are different. These characteristics or “marks” {{permit us to}} understand the galaxy catalogs that carry all this information as realizations <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> point processes. Many attempts have been presented to quantify the dependence of the clustering of galaxies on their inner properties. Aims. The present paper summarizes methods on spatial marked statistics used in cosmology to disentangle luminosity, color or morphological segregation and introduces a new one in this context, the mark connection function. Methods. The methods used here are the partial correlation functions, including the cross-correlation function, the normalized mark correlation function, the mark variogram and the mark connection function. All these methods are applied to a volume-limited sample drawn from the 2 dFGRS, using the spectral type η as the mark. Results. We show the virtues of each method {{to provide information about}} the clustering properties of each population, the dependence of the clustering on the <b>marks,</b> the <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marks</b> {{as a function of the}} pair distances, and the way to characterize the spatial correlation between the marks. We demonstrate by means of these statistics that passive galaxies exhibit a stronger spatial correlation than active galaxies at small scales (r 1 ̆ 0 fc 07 20 h− 1 Mpc), and that the price for galaxies to be close together is in the smaller values <b>of</b> the assigned <b>marks,</b> which means in our case that they are more passive. Through the mark connection function we quantify the relative positioning of different types of galaxies within the overall clustering pattern. Conclusions. The different marked statistics provide different information about the clustering properties of each population. Different aspects of the segregation are encapsulated by each measure, which makes the new one introduced here – the mark connection function – particularly useful for understanding the spatial correlation between the marks. martinez@uv. es; armurpa@uv. e...|$|R

Adult speakers of German, English and a Romance language (French, Italian or Spanish) were investigated {{to explore the}} role of transfer in learning the Dutch grammatical gender system. In the first language (L 1) systems, German is the most similar to Dutch coming from a historically similar system. The Romance languages have grammatical gender; however, {{the system is not}} congruent to the Dutch system. English does not have grammatical gender (although semantic gender is marked in the pronoun system). Experiment 1, a simple gender assignment task, showed that all L 2 participants tested could assign the correct gender to Dutch nouns (all L 2 groups performing on average above 80 %), although having gender in the L 1 did correlate with higher accuracy, particularly when the gender systems were very similar. Effects of noun familiarity and a default gender strategy were found for all participants. In Experiment 2 agreement between the noun and the relative pronoun was investigated. In this task a distinct performance hierarchy was found with the German group performing the best (though significantly worse than native speakers), the Romance group performing well above chance (though not as well as the German group), and the English group performing at chance. These results show that L 2 acquisition of grammatical gender is affected more by the morphological <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> gender <b>marking</b> in the L 1 and L 2 than by the presence of abstract syntactic gender features in the L 1...|$|R

The Court held that “pale pilsen” are generic words which cannot be appropriated pursuant to R.A. 166. As to the bottles, the use of Asia Brewery of the steinie bottle similar to that of San Miguel is merely similar, not identical, and therefore, unlawful. Thus, both the appellate and the High court were in agreement as to what factors to be examined, but not as to the test to be applied and especially not as to the results thereof. What the Court of Appeals perceived as confusing <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marks</b> as a whole the Supreme Court held as merely similar as to the dominant features. Furthermore, the Asia Brewery court held that since San Miguel has virtually monopolized the beer market, those who have been drinking their beer will not be deceived by the newcomer in the market. As a caveat, the Court stated that its decision did not “diminish the ruling in the Del Monte case …” The Court cautioned that the ruling in Del Monte should not be made to apply to all kinds of products, particularly, in this case, to beer, because purchasers of ketchup are “housewives and house help” unlike beer which is purchased by “the beer drinker himself”.|$|R

40|$|Trade marks are {{valuable}} intangible intellectual property (IP) assets with potentially high reputational value {{that can be}} protected. Similarity between trade marks may potentially lead to infringement. That similarity is normally assessed based on the visual, conceptual and phonetic aspects <b>of</b> the trade <b>marks</b> in question. Hence, this thesis addresses this issue by proposing a trade mark similarity assessment support system that uses the three main aspects <b>of</b> trade <b>mark</b> <b>similarity</b> as a mechanism to avoid future infringement. A conceptual model of the proposed trade mark similarity assessment support system is first proposed and developed based on the similarity assessment criteria outlined in a trade mark manual. The proposed model is the first contribution of this study, and it consists of visual, conceptual, phonetic and inference engine modules. The second contribution of this work is an algorithm that compares trade marks based on their visual similarity. The algorithm performs a similarity assessment using content-based image retrieval (CBIR) technology and an integrated visual descriptor derived using the low-level image feature, i. e. the shape feature. The performance of the algorithm is then assessed using information retrieval based measures. The obtained result demonstrates better retrieval performance {{in comparison to the}} state of the art algorithm. The conceptual aspect <b>of</b> trade <b>mark</b> <b>similarity</b> is then examined and analysed using a proposed algorithm that employs semantic technology in the conceptual module. This contribution enables the computation <b>of</b> the conceptual <b>similarity</b> between trade marks, with the utilisation of an external knowledge source in the form of a lexical ontology, together with natural language processing and set similarity theory. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using both information VI retrieval and human collective opinion measures. The retrieval result produced by the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional string similarity comparison algorithm in both measures. The phonetic module examines the phonetic <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>marks</b> using another proposed algorithm that utilises phoneme analysis. This algorithm employs phonological features, which are extracted based on human speech articulation. In addition, the algorithm also provides a mechanism to compare the phonetic aspect <b>of</b> trade <b>marks</b> with typographic characters. The proposed algorithm is the fourth contribution of this study. It is evaluated using an information retrieval based measure. The result shows better retrieval performance in comparison to the traditional string similarity algorithm. The final contribution of this study is a methodology to aggregate the overall similarity score between trade marks. It is motivated by the understanding that trade mark similarity should be assessed holistically; that is, the visual, conceptual and phonetic aspects should be considered together. The proposed method is developed in the inference engine module; it utilises fuzzy logic for the inference process. A set of fuzzy rules, which consists of several membership functions, is also derived in this study based on the trade mark manual and a collection <b>of</b> trade <b>mark</b> disputed cases is analysed. The method is then evaluated using both information retrieval and human collective opinion. The proposed method improves the retrieval accuracy and the experiment also proves that the aggregated similarity score correlates well with the score produced from human collective opinion. The evaluations performed in the course of this study employ the following datasets: the MPEG- 7 shape dataset, the MPEG- 7 trade marks dataset, a collection <b>of</b> 1400 trade <b>marks</b> from real trade mark dispute cases, and a collection of 378, 943 company names...|$|R
