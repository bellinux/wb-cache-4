25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E
60|$|A wild {{little village}} came in sight. This was the destination. Again no. Only the tall, {{handsome}} mountain youth who had <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> her, descended grumbling because the 'bus {{had brought him}} past his road, the driver having refused to pull up. Everybody expostulated with him, and he dropped into the shadow. The big priest squeezed into his place. The 'bus wound on and on, and always towards that hollow sky-line between the high peaks.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{his home}} coming {{proved to be}} a happier event than he had ever dared to hope for. Lucy was quiet and ate but little. At times Pan caught her {{stealing}} a glimpse at him, and each time she blushed. She could not meet his eyes again. Alice too stole shy glances at him, wondering, loving. Bobby was hungry, but he did not forget that Pan <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> him. Mrs. Smith watched Pan with an expression that would have pained him had he allowed remorse to come back then. And his father was funny. He tried to be natural, to meet Pan on a plane of the old western insouciance, but it was impossible. No doubt such happiness had not reigned in that household for years.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1981 and 1987, {{the pair}} {{performed}} [...] "Nightsea Crossing" [...] in twenty-two performances. They <b>sat</b> silently <b>across</b> <b>from</b> {{each other in}} chairs for seven hours a day.|$|R

60|$|Dick Hardman <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> {{the room}} <b>from</b> Pan {{and behind the}} teacher's back he made ugly faces at Pan and, more than that, put his nose to his thumb. Pan {{understood}} that, and quick as a flash, he returned the compliment.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the feast}} of Passover, Hershele once <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> a self-absorbed rich man who made {{derogatory}} remarks about Hershele’s eating habits.|$|E
5000|$|In The Complete Far Side, Larson {{says that}} his {{greatest}} disappointment in life occurred {{when he was at}} a luncheon and <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> cartoonist Charles Addams, creator of The Addams Family. Larson was not able to think of a single thing to say to him and deeply regretted the missed opportunity. (Addams died in 1988.) ...|$|E
50|$|John Hartz sold 8.65 acre of {{his land}} for the Danville Depot and granted land access to the station. He then {{subdivided}} and sold lots east of the station, shifting the town's focus from Front Street to Hartz Avenue. Eventually, a bank, drug store, saloon, doctor's office and Chinese laundry joined the houses lining the street. The Danville Hotel originally <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the station and was moved to face Hartz avenue in 1927.|$|E
6000|$|... "He didn't offer to," [...] Whitwell explained. [...] "I got {{it out of}} him {{in spite}} of him, I guess." [...] He had sat down with his hat on, as his {{absent-minded}} habit was, and he now braced his knees {{against the edge of}} the table. Cynthia <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> it <b>from</b> him with her head drooped over it, drawing vague figures on the board with her finger. [...] "What are you goin' to do?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Anya Liftig's work {{focuses on}} the body and its {{relationship}} to other bodies, other people, and the built environment. She is perhaps best known for her 2010 performance entitled [...] "The Anxiety of Influence," [...] in which she <b>sat</b> directly <b>across</b> <b>from</b> artist Marina Abramovic {{for most of the day}} at the Museum of Modern Art (New York) during Abramovic's performance entitled [...] "The Artist Is Present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Verily, yes. He <b>sat</b> right <b>across</b> <b>from</b> me in {{the corner}} pew. I didn't think him painfully changed. Iron-gray hair becomes him. But I was horribly {{disappointed}} in myself. I had expected to feel at least a romantic thrill, but all I felt was a comfortable interest, such as I might have taken in any old friend. Do my utmost, Louisa, I couldn't compass a thrill." ...|$|R
5000|$|B.F. Keith's Theatre (1894 - 1928) in Boston, Massachusetts, was a {{vaudeville}} playhouse run by B.F. Keith. It <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the Boston Common in the city's theatre district, with {{an entrance}} on Tremont Street {{and another on}} Washington Street. Personnel included Keith, E.F. Albee and H.E. Gustin. Virgilio Tojetti painted some of the interior decorations. [...] "In 1939, the theater found a new life as a movie house called the Normandie Theater." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Steinway Transit depot, {{built in}} 1939, was {{located at the}} {{northwest}} corner of Steinway Street and 20th Avenue in Astoria, Queens, near the northern terminus of the company's [...] route. It was the successor to the Steinway Railway depot. The trolley depot <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the Daimler Manufacturing Company automobile factory, opened in 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and local businessman William Steinway. The bus depot was closed prior to the company's takeover by the city, and has long been demolished, and replaced by new apartment buildings, similar to what was done at the old West Farms Depot site.|$|E
5000|$|The Fort Payne Boom Town Historic District is a {{historic}} district in Fort Payne, Alabama. The district encompasses five properties built around 1889, when Fort Payne was undergoing huge growth owing to the area's mineral deposits. Included are the Alabama Great Southern Depot; the Fort Payne Opera House; the Sawyer Building, a two-story Victorian commercial building; City Park, which <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the (now-demolished) county courthouse; and Purdy Furniture, which built as {{the headquarters of the}} Fort Payne Coal and Iron Company. Another Victorian commercial building has since been demolished. [...] The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} medical interview {{consists of}} 2–4 interviewers <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> a table <b>from</b> the candidate. Interviewers take turns {{to ask the}} candidate set questions and rate their responses on a Likert scale. Interviews last between 15–30 minutes. Questions cover a range of desirable criteria that future doctors should possess.|$|R
50|$|The {{first public}} children's {{playground}} in West Virginia {{was built in}} Welch in 1913. It was constructed using private donations and after 1918 was maintained by the Young Women's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church. The playground <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> the street <b>from</b> the McDowell County Courthouse until 1930 when it became {{the site for the}} United States Post Office.|$|R
60|$|The Pole gulped down a hasty meal, {{talking as}} he ate. Cole <b>sat</b> silently <b>across</b> <b>from</b> him, not eating or speaking. His old {{clothing}} {{had been taken}} away and new clothing given him. He was shaved and rubbed down. His sores and cuts were healed, his body and hair washed. He looked much healthier and younger, now. But he was still stooped and tired, his blue eyes worn and faded. He listened to Sherikov's account {{of the world of}} 2136 AD without comment.|$|R
5000|$|On April 5, 1879, Richardson {{had evidently}} had enough. He {{strode into the}} Long Branch Saloon, {{specifically}} looking for Loving, but Loving was not there at that time. Richardson then settled into a game of poker, and around 9:00 pm Loving strode in. Loving took a seat at a long table, at which point Richardson moved over and <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> him. The two men could be heard talking low to one another, but what was said could not be understood. Suddenly, Richardson said loudly [...] "You wouldn't fight anything you damned son of a bitch", to which Loving said calmly [...] "Try me and see".|$|E
50|$|The {{trial began}} on March 19, 1850, with Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw (Harvard class of 1800) of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court presiding. Associate Justices Samuel Wilde, Charles A. Dewey, and Theron Metcalf were also present. The trial ran for twelve days: March 19-23, March 25-30, and April 1. 60,000 people {{witnessed}} {{at least part}} of the trial (with tickets handed out to the waiting crowds and spectators quickly rotated through); journalists came from as far as London, Paris, and Berlin. The courtroom was large and noisy; Webster sat in the prisoner's dock on the left, surrounded by an iron railing. The judge <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the dock, while the jury sat to his right. On the first day, Webster carried gloves, and he pleaded not guilty.|$|E
5000|$|Jackson was strip {{searched in}} San Quentin's Adjustment Center, then escorted to the visiting room. He <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> Bingham at a wooden table {{that had no}} {{barriers}} between the two and was intermittently observed by guards. Officials speculated that during this time Bingham passed the gun to Jackson, who concealed it in his hair under a watch cap. The meeting lasted about 15 minutes. Around 2:35 pm, Jackson was escorted by officer Frank DeLeon back to the Adjustment Center, where another officer performed a second search prior to returning Jackson to his cell. When that officer asked Jackson about {{what appeared to be}} a pencil in his hair, Jackson pulled the gun out, pointed it at the officers, and inserted a magazine. He reportedly shouted, [...] "This is it!", and ordered all of the officers to lie face down on the floor. Jackson then ordered an officer to get up and activate a switch that opened all 34 cells on the first floor.|$|E

50|$|Fox then {{proceeded}} to unbutton and unzip the sleeping woman's jeans and placed {{his hand on her}} crotch. The woman awoke to find Fox fondling her and quickly confronted him. According to court transcrips, Fox apologized for touching her, then pretended to go to sleep. The woman promptly alerted her parents who <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> the aisle <b>from</b> her and then notified flight attendants, who moved them to other seats.|$|R

5000|$|On Day 29, a {{chef and}} a wine expert {{entered the house}} and served the contestants wine and food. While eating, the viewers chose who <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> who. They later did an interpretive water dance, with the viewers voting that Jeffrey and Andrea had the best dance. On Day 30, Ashley was {{eliminated}} and Kevin returned from limbo. Later that night, Mike and Holly were revealed as the team captains. On Day 31, contestants competed in the [...] "Choose Your Weapon" [...] competition, in which the teams used a weapon to try to smash the opposing team's glass. The glass was on a windmill device, constantly rotating. The first team to smash all eight of their opponent's glasses won. Mike's team won the competition. On Day 32, Holly and Andrea were sent to limbo, after Andrea received four votes from the other contestants. Later in the week, Alex returned to The Glass House and delivered the contestants their [...] "fanswers" [...] for the week.|$|E
50|$|In the study, two and three-year-old {{toddlers}} {{were tested}} on their recognition of markedness within gestures. The experiment {{was conducted in}} a room with an examiner and the test subjects, which for the first study were three-year-olds. The examiner <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> each child individually, and allowed them to play with various objects including a purse with a sponge in it and a box with a sponge in it. After allowing the child to play with the objects for three minutes, the examiner told the child it was time to clean up and motioned by pointing to the objects. They measured the responses of the children by first pointing and not marking the gesture, to see the child's reaction to the request and if they reached for the objects to clean them up. After observing the child's response, the examiner then asked and pointed again, marking the gesture with facial expression, as to lead the child to believe the objects were supposed to be cleaned up. The results showed that three-year-old children were able to recognize the markedness, by responding to the gesture and cleaning the objects up as opposed to when the gesture was presented without being marked.|$|E
5000|$|Shaker diarist Samuel Swan McClelland, whose account runs until 1827, {{notes that}} among the first {{buildings}} constructed was [...] "One hewed-log house... with 4 rooms, and all things {{seemed to be going}} well for the present." [...] A map by the Shaker cartographer Richard McNemar, drawn in the 1820s, shows that at its height, West Union contained 1300 acre of land, [...] "400 well improved." [...] A two-story brick house [...] "50 by 45," [...] with [...] "14 rooms and cellar" [...] served as the Center Family House. Surrounding the house sat a [...] "kitchen, doctor shop, skin shop, weave shop, wash house and smoke house." [...] A [...] "great frame meetinghouse two story 50 by 40" [...] <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> it. The North Family House stood nearby, [...] "30 by 21 two story and a cellar." [...] Several barns and two apple orchards were on the property (one orchard had 400 trees, the other had 700.) A sawmill, grist mill, and fulling mill stood along Busseron Creek, with another mill seven miles (11 km) distant, across the Wabash River in Illinois. In the barnyard could be found [...] "threshing and flax machines." ...|$|E
5000|$|The second location, {{opened in}} fall 1907, was {{situated}} in western Williamsburg on Marcy Avenue between Keap Street and Rodney Street. It <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> the street <b>from</b> the Williamsburgh {{branch of the}} Brooklyn Public Library and near the Marcy Avenue Station of the BMT Jamaica Line (currently served by the , , and [...] trains). The H-shaped building was constructed with gray brick, limestone, and terracotta in Collegiate and English Gothic style.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} filmed in Kansas City, Missouri. Many {{downtown}} landmarks {{can be seen}} in the introduction to the movie and throughout, including the Liberty Memorial. The hospital that was used in the film was known as St. Mary's Hospital that <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> the street <b>from</b> Liberty Memorial in Kansas City. The former hospital was slated for demolition in 2004, and razed in 2005 to make way for a new Federal Reserve Bank building.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Macy's Department Stores {{purchased}} the original Filene's chain. Because many store locations {{between the two}} chains did not overlap, most Filene's locations were spared and reopened as Macy's, but the flagship location (which <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> the street <b>from</b> an existing Macy's store) was not. Macy's shuttered the Filene's in Boston's Downtown Crossing, directly above the flagship Filene's Basement location, and sold the building for redevelopment. That Filene's Basement location was subsequently closed on September 3, 2007, to accommodate the redevelopment project.|$|R
5000|$|An American {{pilot and}} the love {{interest}} of Diana. On his role for the film, Pine said [...] "I am an American pilot who's a spy. It's like a boy's dream: You're either a spy or a fighter pilot. The first thing I wanted to be was a fighter pilot a long time ago. I wanted to be Goose Top Gun". As to how his mortal character would interact with an Amazon, Pine stated [...] "When I first read the script, it had elements of Romancing the Stone, kind of a very classic fish out of water. Two people that don't really bond well at first and they're butting heads and just fun, witty banter". When speaking about meeting the director and being cast, Pine said [...] "Patty is a pretty incredible human being. When we first met about the part of Steve, she <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> me and essentially acted out the entire film {{over the course of}} a two-hour lunch. She was so specific, so articulate, and so ardent. I would've said yes just for Patty alone." [...] Pine went through a workout regime for the film, commenting [...] "I got in incredible shape for this film" [...] but also joking [...] "I was also wearing about 75 pounds of clothing. What I realized is that I made a major mistake, I got in great shape and they just put clothes over all my hard work." ...|$|E

What else do you want?” But all those things didn’t add up to 100 % love. There was nothing between them...|$|E
50|$|In 1928, the {{institute}} was incorporated as a nonprofit, independent research center {{and planning for}} a new Mellon Institute building began that same year. When completed in 1937, {{the institute}} moved into its new building which <b>sat</b> directly <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the newly completed Cathedral of Learning, and handed its original facility, now known as Allen Hall, back to the University of Pittsburgh. The original design called for two more pillars than architect Janssen decided on. The two extra pillars were buried in the large lawn beside the Cathedral of Learning. The pillars are set to be unburied in 2014 as a new pipe system is installed {{in the basement of}} the Cathedral.|$|R

60|$|Miss Cynthia did not {{get much}} comfort out of life that summer. Almost {{everywhere}} she went she was sure to meet Wilbur, engaged in some hard task. She could not help seeing how miserably pale and thin he had become. The worry had its effect on her. The neighbours said that Cynthy was sharper than ever. Even her church-going was embittered. She had always enjoyed walking up the aisle with her rich silk skirt rustling over the carpet, her cashmere shawl folded correctly over her shoulders, and her lace bonnet set precisely on her thin shining crimps. But she could take no pleasure in that or in the sermon now, when Wilbur <b>sat</b> right <b>across</b> <b>from</b> her pew, between hard-featured Robins and his sulky-looking wife. The boy's eyes had grown too large for his thin face.|$|R
