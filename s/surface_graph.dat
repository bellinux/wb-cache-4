Pixel learning takes the input image as the training example and the low frequency component of input as the label to learn (pixel by pixel) based on the look-up table model. The proposed method is very fast and can restore a high-quality image with fine details.

40|$|Increasing age {{heterogeneity}} within {{organizations is}} pressing researchers {{to better understand}} the effects of a multigenerational workforce, teams, and dyads. In response to this, the present research aimed to investigate the effect of employee and supervisor age (in) congruence in relation to job and life satisfaction, as well as retirement intentions, all mediated by leader-member exchange (LMX), using a time-lagged design. Two different theoretical foundations were investigated. Based on the relational demography literature, better outcomes were expected to be associated with age similarity. Theories about implicit expectations relating age and social role guided hypotheses suggesting that beyond just similarity or difference, the direction of age differences would matter. Based on traditional social assumptions that age is associated with experience and wisdom, it was expected that work outcomes would be better when the supervisor was older than the employee, and worse when the supervisor was younger than the employee. Results did not support any of the proposed hypotheses, {{with the exception of the}} established relationship between LMX and job satisfaction. However, response <b>surface</b> <b>graphs</b> and polynomial regression results directed post hoc analyses which did reveal a main effect of supervisor age on LMX and an indirect effect of supervisor age on Time 2 job satisfaction through Time 1 LMX.

30|$|From a neuropsychological {{point of}} view, {{surfaces}} {{are the primary}} factors of 3 D object recognition. 3 D shapes are spatial configurations of surface fragments encoded by IT neurons [4]. Ecological psychologist Gibson regarded that the composition and layout of surfaces to be perceived constitute what they afford [5]. Gestalt psychologists try to settle how local discontinuities in motion or depth are evaluated with respect to object boundaries and surfaces, and it hints that surfaces and their boundaries be the enhanced and ultimate cognitive elements of objects [6]. Similarly, Marr believed that 3 D shape representation is to describe surface geometry [1]. The surface-based representation of 3 D object is the intermediate stage between the image-based representation and 3 D shape representation [7].

From this density estimate we obtain the regularity theorems for soap film-like surfaces spanning graphs with small total curvature. In particular, when n = 3, this density estimate implies that if T C(Γ) < 3. 649 π + κ 2 inf Area(p ×Γ), p∈M then the only possible singularities of a piecewise smooth (M, 0, δ) -minimizing set Σ are the Y-singularity cone.

40|$|Background: Prediction of B-cell epitopes from antigens {{is useful}} to {{understand}} the immune basis of antibodyantigen recognition, and is helpful in vaccine design and drug development. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to this long-studied problem, however, existing methods {{have at least two}} common limitations. One is that they only favor prediction of those epitopes with protrusive conformations, but show poor performance in dealing with planar epitopes. The other limit is that they predict all of the antigenic residues of an antigen as belonging to one single epitope even when multiple non-overlapping epitopes of an antigen exist. Results: In this paper, we propose to divide an antigen <b>surface</b> <b>graph</b> into subgraphs by using a Markov Clustering algorithm, and then we construct a classifier to distinguish these subgraphs as epitope or non-epitope subgraphs. This classifier is then taken to predict epitopes for a test antigen. On a big data set comprising 92 antigen-antibody PDB complexes, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art epitope prediction methods, achieving 24. 7 % higher averaged f-score than the best existing models. In particular, our method can successfully identify those epitopes with a non-planarity which is too small to be addressed by the other models. Our method can also detect multiple epitopes whenever they exist. Conclusions: Various protrusive and planar patches at the surface of antigens can be distinguishable by usin...|$|E
