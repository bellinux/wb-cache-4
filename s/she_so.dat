25|$|In the end, West's anti-Communism {{remained}} {{the centerpiece of}} her politics because <b>she</b> <b>so</b> consistently challenged the Communists as legitimate foes {{of the status quo}} in capitalist countries. In West's view, Communism, like fascism, was merely a form of authoritarianism. Communists were under party discipline and therefore could never speak for themselves. And West was a supreme example of an intellectual who spoke for herself, no matter how her comments might injure her. Indeed, few writers explicitly acknowledged how much West's embrace of unpopular positions hurt her on the left. A whole generation of writers abandoned West and refused to read her, as Doris Lessing suggested.|$|E

The Marschallin {{recognizes that the}} day <b>she</b> <b>so</b> feared has come, as Octavian hesitates between the two women (Trio: Marie Theres'! / Hab' mir's gelobt). In the {{emotional}} climax of the opera, the Marschallin gracefully releases Octavian, encouraging him to follow his heart and love Sophie. She then withdraws elegantly to the next room to talk with Faninal. As soon as she is gone, Sophie and Octavian run to each other's arms. Faninal and the Marschallin return to find the lovers locked in an embrace. After a few bittersweet glances to her lost lover, the Marschallin departs with Faninal. Sophie and Octavian follow after another brief but ecstatic love duet (Ist ein Traum / Spür' nur dich), and the opera ends with little Mohammed running in to retrieve Sophie's dropped handkerchief, and racing out again after the departing nobility.|$|E
25|$|Manon {{had never}} {{let go of}} her desire to act.

With her dark long hair and beauty, <b>she</b> <b>so</b> impressed the theater director Max Reinhardt, that he offered the part of First Angel in a revival of his and Hugo von Hofmannsthal's adaptation of Calderón's The Great Theater of the World for the Salzburg Festival of 1934. Werfel, however, did not think Manon had the training for such an important role, having only performed in a few theater productions that he had directed himself to entertain her mother and their friends on the long back porch of Haus Mahler in Breitenstein, a porch designed by her father in 1916. So, as her stepfather, Werfel refused to allow Manon the opportunity.|$|E

The king, the prince and Marinoni (disguised as each other) enter. Elsbeth is not impressed by the aide-de-camp's song. When she and Fantasio are alone he casts more doubt in her mind about going ahead with the liaison with the prince, and she longs for a reason to delay the union. The court enter and while Marinoni (as the prince) sings her a pompous song in praise of beauty Fantasio climbs a tree and with a stick lifts the wig from the head of the false prince. The marriage of the Mantuan prince is immediately compromised but Fantasio is taken away.|$|E

25|$|On October 16, 1906, in Murray, Kentucky, Brooks {{was born}} to a Methodist minister, the Reverend Cleanth Brooks, Sr., and Bessie Lee Witherspoon Brooks (Leitch 2001). He {{was one of three}} children: Cleanth and William, natural born sons, and Murray Brooks, {{actually}} born Hewitt Witherspoon, whom Bessie Lee Witherspoon kidnapped from her brother Forrest Bedford Witherspoon as a young baby after the natural mother had died. She later was able to change his name to Murray Brooks and continued to raise him as her own, causing quite a rift in her own family and alienating herself from Cleanth and William. Cleanth mentioned {{on more than one occasion}} that <b>she</b> <b>so</b> doted on Murray (Hewitt) that she no longer had a relationship with Cleanth and William. Attending McTyeire School, a private academy, he received a classical education and went on to study at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he received his B.A. in 1928 (Leitch 2001). In 1928, Brooks received his Master of Arts from Tulane University and went on to study at Exeter College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar. He received his B.A. (with honors) in 1931 and his Bachelor of Letters the following year. Brooks then returned to the United States and from 1932 to 1947 was a professor of English at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge (Singh 1991). In 1934, he married Edith Amy Blanchord.|$|E

Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) believed Naomi was [...] "bound to stir up trouble" [...] following her arrival.

Writing for the Hartford Courant, Greg Morago complimented Madonna's vocals and her [...] "remarkable understanding of the material... While some of the numbers have lost their sharp edge ('A New Argentina' lacks requisite anger), the recording benefits from its concentration on the characters' voices. There is a vibrant, contemporary energy and fearless cinematic sweep to this welcome new stamp on the mythic life of Eva Duarte de Perón".|$|E

Highsmith had suggested to Nagy she adapt one of her novels. According to Nagy, Highsmith was not confident that the novel could be made into a [...] "satisfying" [...] film because of its [...] "intense, subjective point of view".

500|$|On November 23, Cisneros' {{request for}} a change of venue was denied by the court. The {{prosecution}} stated that the pool of possible jurors included people from other parts of Cameron County and not just from Brownsville, where most of the county's population resided, and where the murder occurred. They stated it was unlikely that these potential jurors had read the articles from the Houston Chronicle, The Dallas Morning News, or The New Yorker magazine, which the defense provided earlier as evidence that Cisneros was depicted negatively. The trial was pushed ahead to January 31, 1994. The day of the trial, Martínez admitted that she conspired to kill Fischer and agreed to testify against Cisneros and Garza. By entering a plea bargain, Martínez was seeking to be sentenced for a conspiracy charge and to have the capital murder charges dropped. The judge stated that he was not bound by the plea bargain agreement, but clarified that she had the right to drop her guilty plea if <b>she</b> <b>so</b> decided.|$|E
500|$|Confronted by a Puritan {{friend with}} rumours about his [...] "ungodly life", Dudley defended himself in 1576: I {{stand on the}} top of the hill, where ... the {{smallest}} slip seemeth a fall ... I may fall many ways and have more witnesses thereof than many others who perhaps be no saints neither ... for my faults ... they lie before Him who I have no doubt but will cancel them as I have been and shall be most heartily sorry for them. With Douglas Sheffield, a young widow of the Howard family, he had a serious relationship from about 1569. He explained to her that he could not marry, not even in order to beget a Dudley heir, without his [...] "utter overthrow": You must think it is some marvellous cause ... that forceth me thus to be cause almost of the ruin of mine own house ... my brother you see long married and not like to have children, it resteth so now in myself; and yet such occasions is there ... as if I should marry I am sure never to have [...] favour". Although in this letter Leicester said he still loved her as he did at the beginning, he offered her his help to find another husband for reasons of respectability if <b>she</b> <b>so</b> wished. The affair continued and in 1574 [...] Douglas gave birth to a son, also called Robert Dudley.|$|E
500|$|Jocelyn Vena from MTV {{believed}} that the video was symbolic and portrayed how [...] "the old Gaga is over, here's the brand-new Gaga: the one who seems to delight in pushing the boundaries and exploring all manner of sexual proclivities". She further {{believed that}} the video was a testament to Gaga's brilliance [...] "as an artist that uses the video art form as the jump-off point for the next leg of their career". In 2011, Claire Suddath of Time said that although later Gaga videos were more elaborate, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] was Gaga at her best. In Lady Gaga: Behind the Fame, Emily Herbert drew comparisons between the underlying theme of the video and the theme of The Fame Monster—the relationship with fame. She wrote, [...] "Was this the price that Gaga {{had to pay for}} the fame <b>she</b> <b>so</b> desired? Did she feel as if she'd had to prostitute herself in some way? The themes were all based around sex, decadence, and corruption; alcohol and even cigarettes, twenty-first century society's biggest no-no, were present, and so by implication ... drugs." [...] The Wall Street Journal noted Gaga {{as one of the few}} pop stars of the present time who really understood spectacle, fashion, shock, choreography—all the things that Madonna and Michael Jackson were masters of in the 1980s.|$|E

500|$|When Rider Haggard first {{conceived}} of She he {{began with the}} theme of [...] "an immortal woman inspired by an immortal love". Although ostensibly a romance, the novel {{is part of the}} wider discourse regarding women and womanhood in late-Victorian Britain. Many scholars have noted how She was published as a book in 1887, the year of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, and Adrienne Munich argues that Haggard's story [...] "could fittingly be considered an ominous literary monument to Victoria after fifty years of her reign". Indeed, in her devotion to Kallikrates (two thousand years after his death), Ayesha echoes the long-lasting fidelity of Victoria to her husband, Albert. However, unlike the [...] "benign" [...] Victoria, the question of female authority is realised to the extreme in the figure of She-who-must-be-obeyed, whose autonomous will seemingly embodies Victorian anti-feminist fears of New Women desiring 'absolute personal independence coupled with supreme power over men'. Haggard constantly emphasises this anxiety over female authority in <b>She,</b> <b>so</b> that even the rationally minded and misogynistic Holly, who has put his [...] "heart away from such vanity as woman's loveliness", ultimately falls upon his knees and worships Ayesha [...] "as never woman was worshipped". Similarly, although the masculine and chivalric Leo is determined to reject Ayesha for killing the devoted native girl Ustane, he too quickly falls under her will. In fact, Ayesha's absolute command over the male sex {{is one of the most}} startling and unnerving aspects of the story.|$|E
500|$|Other storylines {{received}} a more mixed response. Canning disliked the focus placed on Sam and his thin, [...] "loveable dope" [...] characterization. He {{found that the}} love-triangle plot made little sense, and as such was hard to invest in. In contrast, Poniewozik called Sam's Bieber subplot the episode's strongest element, and deemed it fun if inessential. He praised Glee for capturing the [...] "disposable fun" [...] of Bieber's music, [...] "without either sneering at it or making it more than it is", and called it better in this respect than [...] "The Power of Madonna". Lauren received several positive reviews. While VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than in [...] "Silly Love Songs", Mullins and Gonzalez praised their [...] "endearing" [...] dynamic. Reiter felt that in [...] "Comeback", while new characters like Sam and Lauren [...] "managed to shine", established favorites fared less well: [...] "Finn continues to be dismayingly drained of all that once made him so adorable, and Rachel, too, has been deprived of the depth and sex appeal <b>she</b> <b>so</b> carefully developed over time." [...] Several critics raised similar criticism of Rachel—Gonzalez found her need for Brittany's help [...] "too much of a regression", and disliked her return to [...] "old, desperate habits" [...] after several episodes of personal growth. Canning felt that the storyline was forced, and Poniewozik observed that the episode [...] "seemed to be trying less to advance her character [...] simply to give her something to do." [...] VanDerWerff wrote that Rachel appeared to have five different subplots, none of which came together cohesively, and that it reflected the awkward construction of the episode.|$|E
