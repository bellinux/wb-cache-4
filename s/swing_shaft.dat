40|$|The golf stroke was {{computationally}} modelled using {{finite element}} analysis. Results for the impact between the club {{head and the}} ball compared well with previous research, both practical and theoretical. The results imply that for thick face club heads, such as irons, club head performance is independent of material stiffness but highly dependent on the friction of the interface and the clubhead geometry. The three ball flight predictors (speed, trajectory and spin rate) {{as a function of}} clubhead parameters are shown to be non-trivial. Acceptable models of impact could be achieved using rigid faces for thick face clubheads with the centre of mass and clubhead inertia accurately described. Results on ball construction effects imply that both the stiffness and mass distribution throughout the ball affect performance. The large deformations of the ball mean that classic rigid body mechanics cannot suffice in golf impact predictions. A model of the golf swing based on a double pendulum was constructed and shaft performance examined for various styles of golf <b>swing.</b> <b>Shaft</b> parameters thought to affect performance were quantitatively evaluated and results compared well with previous research. Increased club head speeds at impact were achieved with shafts of lighter weight or reduced bending stiffness for all styles of golf swing examined. The cause of bending forward of the shaft at impact was identified to occur from the large centrifugal forces acting on the head and the increased bending stiffness of the shaft also due to centrifugal force. On a detailed level shaft behaviour was affected by vibrations which appeared chaotic due to the changing stiffness of the system. This is expected to be less of an effect in an actual golf shot due to the damping provided by the human participant...|$|E
50|$|In 1957, the {{lightweight}} Goggomobil used a similar suspension design to the Scarab. Much simpler though, the Goggomobil had bare drive shafts that also acted as the suspension links, with suspension forces {{passing through the}} inboard Hooke joints. The <b>swing</b> axle <b>shafts</b> were only carried by the trailing radius rods, rather than an axle casing, and the long struts were shortened to a simple coilover shock absorber.|$|R
40|$|In the dual-axis {{rotation}} {{inertial navigation}} system (INS), besides the gyro error, accelerometer error, rolling misalignment angle error, and the gimbal angle error, the <b>shaft</b> <b>swing</b> angle and the axis non-orthogonal angle also affect the attitude accuracy. Through {{the analysis of the}} structure, we can see that the <b>shaft</b> <b>swing</b> angle and axis non-orthogonal angle will produce coning errors which cause the fluctuation of the attitude. According to the analysis of the rotation vector, {{it can be seen that}} the coning error will generate additional drift velocity along the rotating shaft, which can reduce the navigation precision of the system. In this paper, based on the establishment of the modulation average frame, the vector projection is carried out, and then the attitude conversion matrix and the attitude error matrix mainly including the <b>shaft</b> <b>swing</b> angle and axis non-orthogonal are obtained. Because the attitude angles are given under the static condition, the <b>shaft</b> <b>swing</b> angle and the axis non-orthogonal angle are estimated by the static Kalman filter (KF). This kind of KF method has been widely recognized as the standard optimal estimation tool for estimating the parameters such as coning angles (α 1, α 2), initial phase angles (ϕ 1,ϕ 2), and the non-perpendicular angle (η). In order to carry out the system level verification, a dual axis rotation INS is designed. Through simulation and experiments, the results show that the amplitudes of the attitude angles’ variation are reduced by about 20 %– 30 % when the shaft rotates. The attitude error equation is reasonably simplified and the calibration method is accurate enough. The attitude accuracy is further improved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrevious studies {{simulating}} shaft movement {{during a}} golf <b>swing</b> demonstrate <b>shaft</b> movement using a {{finite element method}} (FEM) model with the club head modelled as a concentrated mass. The objectives {{of this study are}} to simulate shaft movement while taking into account the inertia effect of the club head. A head was attached to a FEM model of the shaft as a simplified rigid model. We also compared the experimental results and simulation results of the shaft behavior. The simulated results corresponded to the experimental results and we therefore concluded that the inertia force of the club head causes deflection during the swing and torque of inertia angle of the twist during the swing...|$|R
50|$|Long {{drive shafts}} differ from {{standard}} shafts. The main difference is stiffness, as a shaft not stiff enough will lag in an inconsistent manner, causing {{a loss of}} control. These shafts are stiffer in flex and almost always made of graphite, which is lighter than steel. In order to be stiff, a shaft is usually heavier and stronger. The kick point or bend point is also higher for a lower trajectory relative to the <b>swing,</b> and the <b>shaft</b> has a lower torque, meaning {{that it will not}} twist as much, allowing the clubhead to stay straighter.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} {{to using the}} engine as a stressed member, the R1100S has a composite aluminum frame to which the suspension components are attached. The front suspension is BMW's patented Telelever, with long telescopic fork sliders containing neither springs nor damping. In order to minimize [...] "fork dive", braking forces are taken back to the frame via a pivoting wishbone. A monoshock on this wishbone copes with springing and damping. [...] The rear suspension comprises BMW's [...] "Paralever", a single-sided <b>swinging</b> arm encompassing <b>shaft</b> drive. [...] The Paralever mounts directly to the frame instead of to the gearbox as on earlier oilheads. A reviewer reported: “The result is greater frame rigidity and better handling".|$|R
40|$|Conventional golf swing-robots are {{generally}} {{used to evaluate}} the performance of golf clubs and balls. Most of the robots have two or three joints with completely interrelated motion. Therefore, subtle adjustments in swing motion that advanced golfers make according to the characteristics of individual golf clubs are not possible. Consequently, golf swing-robots can not accurately emulate the performance of advanced golfers, which is a problem for evaluation of golf club performance. In this study, a new golf swing-robot that can adjust its motion to both a specified value of swing velocity and the specific characteristics of individual golf clubs was experimentally investigated. This robot utilizes the dynamic interference force produced by <b>swing</b> motion and <b>shaft</b> vibration like advanced golfers. Thus, this new robot can emulate the performance of advanced golfers and can therefore be used for accurate evaluation of golf clubs...|$|R
50|$|Stiffness is {{much less}} complex {{than the other two}} topics. This is {{directly}} and solely tied to your swing speed. The faster the swing, the stiffer the shaft. This is because the faster you swing, the more the club will bend; if the club bends too much, it will whip through impact and the face will be square for a very short time. Stiffer shafts don't flex as much and keep the face squarer through contact. The other side is less stiff shafts will produce a higher ball speed off the face. So the goal is to get the most flexible shaft that fits your swing, but stiff enough so it doesn't hurt your control. This is why it is important that you make sure you are <b>swinging</b> the right <b>shafts</b> for you. Possible options are junior, women, senior, regular, stiff, and xstiff.|$|R
40|$|The PFC 3 D (particle flow code) that models the {{movement}} and interaction of particles by the DEM techniques was employed to simulate the particle movement and to calculate the velocity and energy distribution of collision in two types of impact crusher: the Canica vertical shaft crusher and the BJD horizontal <b>shaft</b> <b>swing</b> hammer mill. The distribution of collision energies was then converted into a product size distribution for a particular ore type using JKMRC impact breakage test data. Experimental data of the Canica VSI crusher treating quarry and the BJD hammer mill treating coal were used to verify the DEM simulation results. Upon the DEM procedures being validated, a detailed simulation {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of the machine design and operational conditions on velocity and energy distributions of collision inside the milling chamber and on the particle breakage behaviour.

50|$|Prior to 1935, hickory was the {{dominant}} material for shaft manufacturing, but it proved difficult to master for most golfers, {{as well as}} being quite frail. Steel would become the ubiquitous choice for much of {{the second half of the}} twentieth century. Although heavier than hickory, it is much stronger and more consistent in its performance. Prior to steel, a player would need a slightly different <b>swing</b> for each <b>shaft</b> given the inherent inconsistencies in the hickory shafts. The graphite shaft was first marketed in 1970 at the PGA Merchandise Show but did not gain widespread use until the mid-1990s and is now used on almost all woods and some iron sets, as the carbon-fiber composite of graphite shafts boasts increased flex for greater clubhead speed at the cost of slightly reduced accuracy due to greater torque. Steel, which generally has lower torque but less flex than graphite, is still widely preferred by many for irons, wedges and putters as these clubs stress accuracy over distance.|$|R
2500|$|Wigwags {{manufactured}} by WRRS and its predecessors were once numerous in the Midwest, with almost every town {{using them to}} protect their main crossings. The most common model was called the Autoflag #5. They functioned {{in much the same}} way as the Magnetic Flagmen. They utilized alternating electromagnets to <b>swing</b> a <b>shaft</b> with an attached illuminated banner. Bells were not integral to the devices as with the Magnetic Flagmen. They employed standard bells that were used on other types of signals, and mounted either to the mast or to a bracket on the top of the center harp style, as in the Devil's Lake, WI photo. Autoflag #5s were widely used on the C, CB, Illinois Central, Soo Line and the Milwaukee Road. A few were also used on the Louisville & Nashville and the Gulf, Mobile & Ohio as well as other roads in the US and Canada. Most of these wigwags were removed in the 1970-1980s as crossings were updated. They were made in both a lower quadrant style and a center harp style similar to the Magnetic Flagman's peachbasket style. [...] Early on, there were Autoflag [...] #5s that would hold the banner behind a shield much like the Magnetic Flagman disappearing banner-style. [...] These were replaced as time went on with the standard two-position banner that hung vertically when not energized. [...] Several railroad, such as the GM and CB, had a second light below the main light on the banner. [...] This served as a second reserve light in case of failure of both bulbs in the main light and as a signal maintainers' warning of a burned out bulb without having to climb up and open the main light to check each bulb. [...] If the secondary light was illuminated, there was an issue with burned out bulbs in the main light.|$|R

40|$|A {{work and}} power (energy) {{analysis}} of the golf swing {{is presented as a}} method for evaluating the mechanics of the golf swing. Two computer models were used to estimate the energy production, transfers, and conversions within the body and the golf club by employing standard methods of mechanics to calculate work of forces and torques, kinetic energies, strain energies, and power during the golf swing. A detailed model of the golf club determined the energy transfers and conversions within the club during the downswing. A full-body computer model of the golfer determined the internal work produced at the body joints during the downswing. Four diverse amateur subjects were analyzed and compared using these two models. The energy approach yielded new information on swing mechanics, determined the force and torque components that accelerated the club, illustrated which segments of the body produced work, determined the timing of internal work generation, measured <b>swing</b> efficiencies, calculated <b>shaft</b> energy storage and release, and proved that forces and range of motion were equally important in developing club head velocity.

40|$|Golf {{is one of}} the few {{games that}} can be enjoyed by players of all ages and its {{popularity}} has grown consistently to achieve the largest sports equipment turnover in both the UK and the USA; consequently, more effort has been expended on golf related research than any other sport. Significant increases in golf equipment performance have been achieved within the past few decades; which in turn, have brought about increased demands for high-technology, high-performance golf equipment. Golfers are used extensively by manufacturers during the testing and development of equipment, where player performances, opinions and perceptions are valued sources of information, however, golfers are inconsistent in performance and they tire. One method of overcoming these shortcomings has been the development of golf swing simulation devices or robots which have been used increasingly over the last four decades. These produce consistent repeatable swings and are now intrinsic instruments for the scientific study of golf by manufacturers, governing bodies and academic institutes alike. The capability of artificial devices to perform human dynamic motions is undoubtedly improving; however, comparatively little scientific effort has been invested to ensure that the swing motions provided by these mechanical devices are representative of golfers' swings. A three-dimensional kinematic study of golfers' swings was undertaken to determine joint positions representative of a double pendulum simplification of the <b>swing</b> and <b>shaft</b> deflection and ball launch data were recorded to permit comparison. A technique for generating golf robot swing commands from the kinematic swing data was developed using interpolation algorithms that ensured the desired number of command joint positions and increased the continuity of the command position derivatives. The swing motions of six golfers with distinctive swing performance characteristics were replicated using a commercially available golf robot with independent axes control and a bespoke modified motion control system. The research has shown that the new robot control system in conjunction with 3 D kinematic swing data enables individual golfers' swings to be replicated with both high levels of accuracy and repeatability.

50|$|The dagger-axe was {{the first}} weapon in Chinese history that was not also a dual-use tool for hunting (such as the bow and arrow) or agriculture. Lacking a point for thrusting, the dagger-axe {{was used in the}} open where there was enough room to <b>swing</b> its long <b>shaft.</b> Its {{appearance}} on the Chinese battlefield predated the use of chariots and the later dominance of tightly packed infantry formations. During the Zhou dynasty, the ji or Chinese halberd gradually became more common on the battlefield. The ji was developed from the dagger-axe by adding a spear head {{to the top of the}} shaft, thereby enabling the weapon to be used with a thrusting motion as well as a swinging motion. Later versions of the ji, starting in the Spring and Autumn period, combined the dagger-axe blade and spear head into a single piece. By the Han dynasty, the more versatile ji had completely replaced the dagger-axe as a standard infantry weapon. The ji itself was later replaced by the spear as the primary polearm of the Chinese military. By the Warring States period, large masses of infantry fighting in close ranks using the spear or ji had displaced the small groups of aristocrats on foot or mounted in chariots who had previously dominated the battlefield.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} a spring-loaded stack of thin disks on a central shaft. Around this are arranged other stacked disk packs {{on a number of}} planetary shafts, usually three. These shafts are mounted on swinging arms, so that they may be moved in and out together. The central disks are thin, with a thickened rim. The planet disks are tapered across their radius, at an included angle of around 3°. When the disks are intermeshed, they thus only contact at the rim of the central pack, no matter what the spacing of the shafts. These planetary disk packs have a gear meshing with a gear on the <b>swing</b> arms' fulcrum <b>shafts,</b> which in turn meshes with a central gear, used for the input drive. The central shaft is the output shaft and the gear is used as a reduction gear. When the disks are moved outwards, the central rim drives on the outside radius of the similar-sized tapered disks and the overall ratio is around 1:1. As the swing arms are moved inwards, the tapered disks are forced between the central rims against their spring-loading. The effective radius of the tapered disks is thus reduced and the gear ratio increases. The gear is made in a variety of ratio ranges, typically from 3:1 to 10:1. Overall efficiency is good, greater than 90%.|$|R
40|$|Dynamics of huge renovated lathe is simulated. Turning scheme {{concerns}} to heavy rotor shaft finishing. Lofty parts and milling head may create dynamic problems. Static, modal and harmonic {{frequency response function}} simulations were provided. Bearing system consists of bed, support, tool, lunettes, tailstock. Headstock didn’t take part in shaft holding. Static and dynamic rigidities founded 3 – 4 times less for support than for shaft. Tool rigidity lessens from 186. 5 to 11. 9 N/µm for speeding from slow to near resonance turning. Twelve lathe eigenmodes were evaluated. Two eigenmodes are most dangerous. It is “shaft swinging on lunettes” (M 1, 26. 7 Hz) and “support pecking” (M 3, 54. 4 Hz). Bed has excessive flexibility due to through holes and lack of inner ribbing. Polymer concrete filling is moderately effective. Changing two-lunette (2 L) scheme to three-lunette (3 L) increases rigidity of shaft at 2. 09 times at statics but gives limited action in dynamics. Resonant peaks on frequency response function are lowered only at 1. 32 times for M 1, M 3. Effect of dynamic damping is revealed under condition of proximity middle lunette to lofty support. Support serves as tuned mass damper. Measures of machine tool reinforcement are simulated. <b>Shaft</b> <b>swinging</b> according to M 1 may hardly be blocked by passive means. It {{would be better to}} bypass it. “Support pecking” resonance (M 3) succumbs to only full set of measures. Small effect of partial reinforcement is predicted. Three frequency intervals are recommended for turn-milling at huge lathe: pre-resonant ( 65 Hz). The last one is more suited. Next design step is to create triangle inner ribbing system or caissons inside of bed. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{determine}} how shaft length affects golf driving performance. Shaft length effects on the golf swing have been of interest to several researchers (including Egret et al., 2003; Reyes and Mittendorf, 1999 and Mitzoguchi and Hashiba, 2002). A range of drivers with lengths between 46 " and 52 ", representing lengths close to the 48 " limit imposed by the R&A Rules Limited (2004), were assembled and evaluated. A 5 -camera three dimensional motion analysis system tracked skin markers attached to 9 low-medium handicapped (5. 4 ± 2. 8) golfers. Clubhead and ball launch conditions and drive distance and accuracy were determined for 5 lowmedium handicapped golfers (5. 1 ± 2. 0) and 7 elite golfers (0. 21 ± 2. 41) who performed shots on a purpose-built practice hole. Finally, motion analysis was conducted for an elite golfer (+ 1 handicap) and experimentally obtained marker data was used to drive a large-scale musculoskeletal model. Low-medium handicapped golfers demonstrated more significant variation in performance due to shaft length than elite golfers. Postural kinematics remained largely unaffected, as were ball spin, launch angle and <b>swing</b> tempo. As <b>shaft</b> length increased from 46 " to 52 ", initial ball velocity (+ 1. 90 ms- 1, p 0. 98, p < 0. 05). Simulations showed that for the range of clubs modelled (46 " to 50 ") hip/shoulder differential angle {{at the top of}} the backswing increased significantly (+ 6. 13 º, p < 0. 001) as shaft length increased, and each 2 " increase in shaft length required a NS additional 4. 5 N force (p = 0. 117) to maintain normal swing kinematics. The results from this thesis indicate that modest improvements in shot performance brought about by increasing driver length are the result of increased hip/shoulder differential angle {{at the top of the}} backswing and increased predicted muscle force...|$|R
