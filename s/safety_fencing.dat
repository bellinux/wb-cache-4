5|$|The race {{took place}} in the {{afternoon}} from 14:00 CEST (UTC+2), in dry and sunny weather. At the start of the race, J.J. Lehto stalled his Benetton on the grid. Pedro Lamy, starting from further back on the grid, had his view of the stationary Benetton blocked by other cars and hit the back of Lehto's car, causing bodywork and tyres to fly into the air. Parts of the car went over the <b>safety</b> <b>fencing</b> designed to protect spectators at the startline causing minor injuries to nine people. Further back, Martin Brundle had a good start, overtaking two cars as well as Lehto, propelling him from thirteenth to tenth place.|$|E

25|$|Ballycotton has a cliff walk {{extending}} westward to Ballytrasna. The full walk {{is about}} 9km along a goat-track, with <b>safety</b> <b>fencing</b> {{where it is}} needed. Cycling and horse riding are prohibited on the trail. There is bench seating placed {{at a number of}} viewing points. The cliff walk is used annually, in March, for a charity walk in support of the Children of Chernobyl. There is also the possibility of spotting Peregrine Falcons near the rocky inlets at dawn and dusk.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} design {{did not include}} a <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> to prevent suicide attempts and base jumping. Three-metre high <b>safety</b> <b>fences</b> attached {{to the top of the}} concrete traffic barrier were later installed to prevent these incidents occurring. Anti-climbing screens are part of the second bridge's security features.|$|R
500|$|Footpaths [...] wide {{on either}} side of the bridge were formed by {{concrete}} cast in situ and cantilevered out from the adjacent beams. These footpaths were separated from the roadway and the bridge's edge by lightweight aluminium balustrades and <b>safety</b> <b>fences</b> installed by Bristile. The street lights were integrated into the <b>safety</b> <b>fence.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{speedway}} {{track was}} unusual {{because it did}} not have a <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> as the stock car circuit acted as a run-off area. It was not until 1991 that a <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> was installed, but the lack of fence encouraged the riders to ride wider lines than they would otherwise have done.|$|R
25|$|The {{station has}} 11 platforms. Platforms 1–4 are for London Underground, Platforms 5 and 8 are for inner {{suburban}} services, Platform 9 is for Thameslink and platforms 10a and 10b for Tramlink. Platforms 6 and 7 are {{adjacent to the}} fast tracks intended for express and outer suburban services, {{but most of these}} services only call at Wimbledon during the lawn tennis championships. Because long distance trains very rarely make scheduled stops at the station, access to these platforms is via sliding gates through <b>safety</b> <b>fencing</b> installed in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Kilkivan Shire Council, {{with the}} help of a grant from the National Trust, {{undertook}} work to restore the historic Mount Clara Copper Smelter.

[...] Mount Clara Chimney was registered with the National Trust of Queensland, and is on the Queensland Heritage Register.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, strong upwinds at the Mausefalle caused race {{officials}} {{to lower the}} start , shortening the course by [...] [...] This eliminated most of the Startschuss and its instantaneous speed; the Mausefalle was accordingly altered to a speed-inducing pitch, rather than a formidable jump and compression. [...] Though Didier Cuche won the race, the 2008 edition is likely best remembered for the high-speed crash of Scott Macartney on the Zielsprung, seconds before the finish, as well as Bode Miller tying for second with Mario Scheiber after riding the <b>safety</b> <b>fencing</b> in the Steilhang section.|$|E
50|$|Footpaths 8 ft wide {{on either}} side of the bridge were formed by {{concrete}} cast in situ and cantilevered out from the adjacent beams.

50|$|The shaft is {{open and}} well defined behind a chain wire <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> (14m x 14m) that was erected in the late 1960s by the Charters Towers City Council. A {{temporary}} wire chain <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> {{has been placed on}} the eastern side presumably to render safe this side from subsidence. The shaft {{is open and}} intact. 50 metres to the south-west is a brick magazine. Substantial foundations for mine machinery associated with the mine lie to the north. The Day Dawn PC No. 4 is in evidence to the east as has a temporary <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> around it. The USL on which the shaft lies is heavily grassed and is generally clear of other built or natural features.|$|R

40|$|DE 102007042454 A 1 UPAB: 20090423 NOVELTY - The <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> has a {{mechanical}} blocking unit (1) e. g. wire mesh, for preventing a penetration through the <b>safety</b> <b>fence.</b> An optical fiber (5) is provided, where an optical signal i. e. light wave (4), is injectable into the optical fiber using a transmitter. The optical signal is receivable by a receiver, where {{changes of the}} optical signal are detectable based on {{a mechanical}} load of the optical fiber. The optical fiber {{is formed as a}} portion of a casing (3) by a sub-region of the mechanical blocking unit. The optical fiber is made of a plastic material, and a core (2) is made of a metal. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for detecting an intrusion on a <b>safety</b> <b>fence.</b> USE - <b>Safety</b> <b>fence</b> for encircling a safety area. ADVANTAGE - The optical signal is injectable into the optical fiber using the transmitter and receivable by the receiver, where the changes of the optical signal are detectable based on the mechanical load of the optical fiber that is formed as the portion of the casing by the sub-region of the mechanical blocking unit, thus allowing the reliable notification of the unauthorized intrusion into a safety area as well as the destruction of the <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> encircling the <b>safety</b> area...|$|R
50|$|After {{completion}} of upgrading the A66 between Greta Bridge-Scotch Corner in 2007, two pegasus crossings were {{installed on the}} section of the dual carriageway in 2009, immediately to the west of Scotch Corner. These crossings included raised buttons for horse riders, <b>safety</b> <b>fences</b> and lights to control the traffic which consisted of only two orange lights. These crossings never became operational and {{with the exception of the}} <b>safety</b> <b>fences</b> were later removed.|$|R
40|$|This report {{proceeds}} from the basic idea that the risk factor of <b>safety</b> <b>fences</b> should be {{less than that of}} the danger so it screens off.
