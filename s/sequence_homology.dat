5|$|A {{multiple}} sequence alignment (MSA) is {{a sequence}} alignment {{of three or}} more biological sequences, generally protein, DNA, or RNA. In many cases, the input set of query sequences are assumed to have an evolutionary relationship by which they share a lineage and are descended from a common ancestor. From the resulting MSA, <b>sequence</b> <b>homology</b> can be inferred and phylogenetic analysis can be conducted to assess the sequences' shared evolutionary origins. Visual depictions of the alignment as in the image at right illustrate mutation events such as point mutations (single amino acid or nucleotide changes) that appear as differing characters in a single alignment column, and insertion or deletion mutations (indels or gaps) that appear as hyphens {{in one or more}} of the sequences in the alignment. Multiple sequence alignment is often used to assess sequence conservation of protein domains, tertiary and secondary structures, and even individual amino acids or nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|Isoform “a” {{of human}} CASS4 is {{considered}} the predominant species, and at 786 amino acids is the longest one. Amino acid <b>sequence</b> <b>homology</b> of this isoform of human CASS4 with other family members is 26% overall identity and 42% similarity. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, the CASS4 protein SH3 domain was shown {{to interact with the}} FAK C-terminus, despite the lowest overall similarity to other SH3 domains in the CAS group. In addition, human CASS4 has a limited number of candidate SH2-binding sites, estimated at 10, which is similar to EFS (estimated at 9) and in contrast to p130Cas/BCAR1 and NEDD9, which have 20 and 18 respectively. The CASS4 C-terminus has a short region of CAS family homology, but lacks obvious similarity at the level of primary amino acid sequence. It also lacks a YDYVHL sequence at the N-terminal end of the FAT-like carboxy-terminal domain, even though this motif is conserved among the other three CAS family proteins and is an important binding site for the Src SH2 domain. Although this lack of sequence similarity may mean a reduced functionality of the CASS4 protein, molecular modeling analysis performed by Singh and colleagues using p130CAS/BCAR1 structures as templates suggested an almost identical fold between CASS4 and p130CAS/BCAR1 within their SH3 domains, and substantial similarity within 432-591 residues of CASS4 and 449-610 residues of p130Cas/BCAR1 at the level of secondary and tertiary structures. Also, the similar periodicity of α-helices and β-sheets in both CASS4 and p130Cas/BCAR1 provides another confirmation for the idea of well-conserved structures within the family members.|$|E

40|$|A wide-ranging {{examination}} of plastid (pt) DNA <b>sequence</b> <b>homologies</b> within higher plant nuclear genomes (promiscuous DNA) was undertaken. Digestion with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes and Southern {{analysis was used}} to distinguish plastid and nuclear DNA in order to assess the extent of variability of promiscuous sequences within and between plant species. Some species, such as Gossypium hirsutum (cotton), Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco), and Chenopodium quinoa, showed homogenity of these sequences, while intraspecific sequence variation was observed among different cultivars of Pisum sativum (pea), Hordeum vulgare (barley), and Triticum aestivum (wheat). Hypervariability of plastid <b>sequence</b> <b>homologies</b> was identified in the nuclear genomes of Spinacea oleracea (spinach) and Beta vulgaris (beet), in which individual plants were shown to possess a unique spectrum of nuclear <b>sequences</b> with ptDNA <b>homology.</b> This hypervariability apparently extended to somatic variation in B. vulgaris.

40|$|The {{search for}} amino acid <b>sequence</b> <b>homologies</b> {{can be a}} {{powerful}} tool for predicting protein structure. Discovered <b>sequence</b> <b>homologies</b> are currently used in predicting the function of oncogene proteins. To sharpen this tool, we investigated the structural significance of short <b>sequence</b> <b>homologies</b> by searching proteins of known three-dimensional structure for subsequence identities. In 62 proteins with 10, 000 residues, we found that the longest isolated homologies between unrelated proteins are five residues long. In 6 (out of 25) cases we saw surprising structural adaptability: the same five residues are part of an alpha-helix in one protein and part of a beta-strand in another protein. These examples show quantitatively that pentapeptide structure within a protein is strongly dependent on sequence context, a fact essentially ignored in most protein structure prediction methods: just considering the local sequence of five residues is not sufficient to predict correctly the local conformation (secondary structure). Cooperativity of length six or longer must be taken into account. Also, we are warned that in the growing practice of comparing a new protein sequence with a data base of known sequences, finding an identical pentapeptide sequence between two proteins is not a significant indication of structural similarity or of evolutionary kinship...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{dissimilar}} <b>sequence</b> <b>homology</b> between {{self and}} foreign peptide, weak electrostatic interactions between foreign peptide and the MHC can also mimic self peptide to elicit an autoimmune response within the host. For example, charged residues can explain the enhanced on-rate and reduced off-rate of a particular antigen or can contribute to a higher affinity and activity for a particular antigen that can perhaps mimic that of the host. Similarly, prominent ridges {{on the floor of}} peptide-binding grooves can do such things as create C-terminal bulges in particular peptides that can greatly increase the interaction between foreign and self peptide on the MHC. Similarly, there has been evidence that even gross features such as acidic/basic and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions have allowed foreign peptides to interact with an antibody or MHC and TCR. It is now apparent that sequence similarity considerations are not sufficient when evaluating potential mimic epitopes and the underlying mechanisms of molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry, from these examples, has therefore been shown to occur {{in the absence of any}} true <b>sequence</b> <b>homology.</b>|$|E

25|$|A protein {{superfamily}} is {{the largest}} grouping (clade) of proteins for which common ancestry can be inferred (see homology).
