In 1957 he was appointed chairman of a committee which reviewed the group of departments concerned with defence. The Menzies government accepted the committee's recommendation that Supply and Defence Production be amalgamated, but dropped the key proposal that the Department of Defence absorb the Departments of Army, Navy and Air. This reform was finally carried out by the Whitlam government in 1975.|$|E

500|$|A 2007 report {{concluded}} that wood fuel exceeded hydroelectric and wind {{as the largest}} potential source of renewable energy. Scotland's forests, which made up 60% of the UK resource base, were forecast {{to be able to}} provide up to 1 million tonnes of wood fuel per annum. The biomass energy supply in Scotland was forecast to reach 450 MW or higher, (predominantly from wood), with power stations requiring 4,500–5,000 oven dry tonnes per annum per megawatt of generating capacity. However a 2011 Forestry Commission and Scottish government follow-up {{report concluded}} that: [...] "...there is no capacity to support further large scale electricity generation biomass plants from the domestic wood fibre resource." [...] A plan to build in Edinburgh a 200 MW biomass plant which would have imported 83% of its wood, was withdrawn by Forth Energy in 2012. The energy company E.ON has constructed a 44 MW biomass power station at Lockerbie using locally sourced crops while the smaller EPR Westfield power plant in Fife produces 9.8 MW of output using chicken litter as fuel. The Scottish Executive and the Forestry Commission issued a Scottish Biomass Action Plan in 2007. The Scottish Government set up the Scottish Biomass <b>Support</b> <b>Scheme</b> in 2006 with a £7.5 million grant, later increased to £10.5 million, to support biomass energy. £6 million of grants were drawn down by the time the scheme finished in March 2008 and a 2009 review of results concluded that the scheme had [...] "...achieved limited success against its strategic aims objectives." [...] A 2007 article by Renew Scotland claimed that automatic wood pellet boilers could be as convenient to use as conventional central heating systems. These boilers might be cheaper to run and, by using locally produced wood fuel, could try to be as carbon neutral as possible by using little energy for transportation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{noticeable}} {{disparity between}} the University of Edinburgh's research capacity, endowment and international status on the one hand, and its ranking in national league tables on the other, is largely {{on account of the}} central role which 'student satisfaction' plays in the latter. The University of Edinburgh was ranked bottom in the UK for teaching quality by its students in the 2012 National Student Survey. According to The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2015, [...] "The university is trying to address undergraduates' concerns with a new personal tutor system and a peer <b>support</b> <b>scheme.</b> However, Edinburgh achieved an unwanted clean sweep of rock bottom rankings among universities in this year's National Student Survey (NSS) for questions to do with the promptness, usefulness and extent of academic feedback, suggesting the university {{still has a long way}} to go to turn around a poor position". In the 2017 guide, Edinburgh fell to its worst ever position of joint 37th (placed with local Heriot-Watt University) in a domestic league table. The fall was attributed to lower NSS scores combined with a significant drop (78.6% to 73%) in the prospects of its graduates.|$|E
40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{can reduce}} carbon dioxide emissions, increase energy efficiency, {{and help to}} reduce the dependency on oil imports. However, today's technical and economic challenges are preventing mass-market adoption. In order to create an early market and support economies of scale in production, some European countries have already established <b>support</b> <b>schemes.</b> This research study aims to {{provide an overview of}} the existing <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> in Europe and to assess them using four criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, practicability, and political acceptance. The study concludes with an impact analysis of today's economic <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> which considers the total costs of ownership. While one-time <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> help to reduce the large initial investments for EVs, recurring instruments are often more effective and efficient but also smaller in volume. The comparison of the different regional incentive schemes reveals that EVs today are only economically attractive in Denmark and Norway, but at relatively high prices. Thus, regulators need to increase the volume and efficiency of the <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> establish high scoring instruments, and align these on a European scale. In addition, non-monetary support, e. g. free-parking, can help to overcome technical or smaller economic hurdles. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{applies the}} real options method to analyse the defer option value and optimal {{investment}} timing for solar photovoltaic projects in China. The {{main purpose of}} this paper is to examine investment behaviours under different market systems and <b>support</b> <b>schemes.</b> This paper further investigates the interaction of technological progress and <b>support</b> <b>schemes.</b> Four scenarios are designed, and the corresponding real options models are established. In the case study, we find that electricity market reform enhances the defer option value in the short term but makes the owners of solar PV projects postpone their investment. Nevertheless, the government can stimulate investment by implementing appropriate <b>support</b> <b>schemes.</b> Additionally, the impacts of different <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> vary according to the market system. The impacts of feed-in tariffs and price premiums are similar in a regulated market but are different in a free market. The price premium scheme greatly promotes the defer option values in the short term, but the feed-in tariff scheme excels in the long term. A feed-in tariff has a greater impact on reducing the expected execution time and its variance than the price premium. In addition, more attractive <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> are required when the technological level is improved...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{cost-effective}} RES-E deployment it is often argued that technology-neutral <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for renewables are indispensable. Against this background, RES-E support policies making widely use of technology differentiation in remuneration settings, e. g. across the EU, are frequently criticized from a theoretical point of view. However, {{in this paper we}} provide a systematic critique of the technology neutrality concept as a foundation for designing policy <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> in the RES-E technology field. Specifically, the main objective of the paper is to scrutinize the arguments for technology-neutrality, and discuss three conceptual arguments for why technology-specific <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> could in fact help minimize the societal costs of reaching future RES-E targets. We also briefly address different political economy concerns, which could constrain the choice of cost-effective policy <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> and that have {{to be taken into account}} for economic policy advice. For empirical illustration of the key arguments we refer to the case of German RES-E support...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for {{renewable}} energy sources in the electricity sector (RES-E) are currently being implemented in EU member states. The main tools {{used for this purpose}} are either price-based policy instruments such as feed-in tariffs or premiums, or quantity-based instruments such as quota systems using tradable green certificates. Much work has been devoted to the motivation for and evaluation of these instruments, mostly in the form of country/local case studies, model simulations, or econometric modeling. The main drivers behind these policies are addressing the externalities of the environmentally harmful emissions of electricity generation and stimulating technological innovation. Two frequently used evaluation criteria for <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> and instruments are their effectiveness and economic efficiency. We find that those <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> which are most effective in stimulating the growth of RES-E generation, are typically economically efficient as we ll. Generally, it can be concluded that <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> which are technology specific, and those that avoid unnecessary risks in project revenues, are more effective and efficient than technology-neutral <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> or schemes with higher revenue risk. The most recent quantitative assessment shows that some convergence can now be observed between schemes applying price- and quantity-based instruments. With respect to policy effectiveness, quota schemes show improvements. Regarding efficiency, the situation is still very heterogeneous, and remuneration levels in many EU member states are still substantially higher than generation costs...|$|R
