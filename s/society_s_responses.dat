40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} explore the ethnic consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>response</b> {{to the use of}} cultural symbols in marketing communications. In this effort, Speech Accommodation Theory was extended to the non-verbal domain, and used to develop hypotheses about the potential consequences of intercultural accommodation efforts. Intercultural accommodation is defined as the attempt of a communicator to use the ethnic group 2 ̆ 7 s culture (e. g. ethnic music or backdrops in advertising, or contributions to ethnic causes) in an attempt to gain approval or enhance communication with ethnic group members. A model was developed that can be used across ethnic groups, and was tested with African-American and Hispanic consumers. ^ The consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>response</b> to accommodation attempts is modeled as three constructs; recognition, attributional response, and affective response. The antecedents which are expected to influence the direction of the response are the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s accommodation experience, attitudes toward accommodation, agent knowledge, strength of ethnic identification, attitude toward the mainstream culture, and the 2 ̆ 2 newness 2 ̆ 2 of the communication itself. The consequences of the consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>response</b> to the accommodation attempt are hypothesized to take the form of evaluative effects (attitude toward the brand, the company, and the ad), influences on the effectiveness of the communication (comprehension and message recall), and reciprocal accommodative behaviors (positive word-of-mouth and intentions to buy). ^ The study found support for the three factor representation of the consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>response</b> to the accommodation attempt. The hypothesized consequences of the consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>response</b> were also supported. The significance of the antecedents varied between the African-American and Hispanic samples. This study contributes to theory development by validating constructs and measures {{that can be used to}} study intercultural accommodation. The model can be used to detect differences among ethnic groups, and to predict consequences of the use of accommodation in targeting. The managerial contributions lie primarily in delineating the complexity of the consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>response</b> to ethnic target marketing: intercultural accommodation efforts are not always received positively, and may have the opposite effects of those intended. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives—To {{investigate}} if {{the reduced}} P 50, N 100 and P 200 auditory evoked potential (EP) components and gating deficits seen in schizophrenia {{can be explained}} in terms of response incompleteness. Methods—Twenty-five healthy and schizophrenia participants were studied using pairs of 1000 Hz tones (S 1 and S 2, 0. 5 s apart) separated by 8. 0 s. A correlation-based clustering method identified the responses containing P 50, N 100, and/or P 200 related-activity. Results—Schizophrenia participants produced fewer S 1 and <b>S</b> 2 <b>responses</b> containing all three EP components than healthy participants. Healthy participants, but not the patient population, produced fewer and smaller S 2 than <b>S</b> 1 <b>responses</b> containing all three EP components. However, the <b>S</b> 2 <b>responses</b> following complete <b>S</b> 1 <b>responses</b> were smaller than the complete <b>S</b> 1 <b>responses</b> in both populations. Conclusions—The gating deficits observed in schizophrenia are due to two mechanisms. First, the <b>S</b> 1 <b>response</b> consistency is less in schizophrenia than in health. Second, the <b>S</b> 2 <b>responses</b> are attenuated less in schizophrenia. Significance—This research contributes to the understanding of response variability and sensory gating in health and schizophrenia.

40|$|The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) is a side-agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), {{to which}} the United States, Canada, and Mexico are {{signatory}} parties (Parties). A central feature of the NAAEC is its citizen submission on enforcement matters (SEM) process, by which citizens and citizen groups {{from any of the}} three signatory countries can call on the NAAEC Secretariat to consider whether a Party is failing to effectively enforce its environmental laws. To date, there have been eighty-one citizen submissions filed against the three Parties. Much of the scholarship surrounding the SEM process has concerned its efficacy, particularly from the perspective of citizens and non-governmental organizations. In contrast, there has been relatively little work done that seeks to understand {{the manner in which the}} Parties have interacted with this innovative SEM process. To assess whether and to what extent the SEM process is working, and to envision ways that the process (or analogous ones) might be improved, it is. important to gain a better understanding of how governments perceive and react to processes of this kind. This Article represents a tentative foray into this research area. For this Article, we examined only SEM submissions against Canada.

40|$|Kant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>response</b> to Hume in the Critique of Pure Reason is {{generally}} considered to be narrow in scope, fundamentally critical, and focused solely on Hume 2 ̆ 7 s account of causation. In this dissertation, I argue that this view is, at best, a very narrow one and, at worst, a serious distortion of the differences between Kant 2 ̆ 7 s and Hume 2 ̆ 7 s philosophical views and of Hume 2 ̆ 7 s influence {{on the development of the}} Critique. On my view, Kant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>response</b> is not only more sympathetic than is traditionally supposed but also critical of Hume in ways that have been overlooked. Once these aspects are identified, it becomes clear that, far from being limited to his account of causation, Kant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>response</b> to Hume involves arguments in every major section of the Critique. More specifically, Hume exerted a positive influence on the development of the Transcendental Dialectic and, more generally, on Kant 2 ̆ 7 s conception of a ‘critique of pure reason’. But Kant was also critical of Hume 2 ̆ 7 s diagnosis of and remedy for our natural desire to acquire knowledge of supersensible objects and of aspects of Hume 2 ̆ 7 s critique of theism in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. Although the account of Kant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>response</b> to Hume that emerges is more nuanced than others, its central theme is quite simple. The continuities between Kant and Hume are far greater than {{is generally}} believed and, indeed, almost as important as the differences. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Parental behaviors, emotions, and cognitions {{are known}} to {{influence}} children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>response</b> to pain. However, prior work has not tested the association between maternal psychological factors and children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>responses</b> to a conditioned pain modulation (CPM) task. CPM refers to the reduction in perceived pain intensity for a test stimulus following application of a conditioning stimulus to a remote area of the body, and is thought to reflect the descending inhibition of nociceptive signals. METHODS: The present study examined sex differences in the association between maternal anxiety about pain and children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> CPM <b>responses</b> in 133 healthy children aged 8 - 17 years. Maternal pain anxiety was assessed using the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale- 20. In addition to the magnitude of CPM, children 2 ̆ 7 s anticipatory anxiety and pain-related fear of the CPM task were measured. RESULTS: Sequential multiple linear regression revealed that even after controlling for child age and general maternal psychological distress, greater maternal pain anxiety {{was significantly related to}} greater CPM anticipatory anxiety and pain-related fear in girls, and to less CPM (ie, less pain inhibition) in boys. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate sex-specific relationships between maternal pain anxiety and children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>responses</b> to a CPM task over and above that accounted for by the age of the child and the mother 2 ̆ 7 s general psychological distress...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the new nativism {{movement in the}} United States. Specifically I look at groups who have formed in Arizona to combat illegal crossings over the U. S. -Mexico border. The new nativism arises from the perceived inability {{of the government to}} secure the border from illegal crossing. I draw on community policing and vigilante literatures to determine whether these groups could be considered a neighborhood watch or vigilante group. Using a sequential mixed method design, I conduct semi-structured interviews and engage in participate observation in the Sonoran desert with the Arizona Border Defenders, to identify how these groups label their actions. In addition to the qualitative methods, I employ a survey to group members to gauge the commonality between their views and the general public. Having gained a limited sample, I use t-tests to determine a significant difference between their means and use descriptive statistics to bolster the explanations provided from the interviews and participant observations. These groups respond to the threat of undocumented immigrants and their potential harm to the U. <b>S.</b> <b>society.</b> Their <b>response</b> is neither wholly vigilante nor neighborhood watch. I discover two main types of members, the wholly vigilante and the hybrid identity. I provide a critical assessment of the views group members hold to determine three main categories; mistaken beliefs, exaggerated truths, and genuine concerns.
