5|$|During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan campaigned {{heavily on}} the {{platform}} that Carter was weak on defense, citing the cancellation of the B-1 program as an example, a theme he continued using into the 1980s. During this time Carter's defense secretary, Harold Brown, announced the <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber</b> project, apparently implying {{that this was the}} reason for the B-1 cancellation.|$|E
5|$|After {{six years}} with no buyers, in late 1986 Northrop {{canceled}} the $1.2billion project. Northrop {{was reluctant to}} protest perceived favoritism of the F-16 in fear of losing support for the project for the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber.</b> Ongoing negotiations with the Royal Moroccan Air Force for 20 F-20s were canceled; along with the small order by Bahrain. Later on, a bribery scandal would emerge from the attempts to market the F-20 to South Korea, leading to several Northrop managers resigning and the reprimanding of chief executive Thomas V. Jones, who retired in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} {{restarted}} in 1981, largely as an interim measure while the <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber</b> entered service. This {{led to a}} redesign as the B-1B, which had lower top speed at high altitude of Mach 1.25, but improved low-altitude performance of Mach 0.96. The electronics were also extensively improved during the redesign, and the airframe was improved to allow takeoff with the maximum possible fuel and weapons load. The B-1B began deliveries in 1986 and formally entered service with Strategic Air Command (SAC) as a nuclear bomber in 1986. By 1988, all 100 aircraft had been delivered.|$|E

5|$|Cheney's most {{immediate}} issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate {{to cut the}} budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup {{at the height of}} the Cold War. As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, the B-2 <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber,</b> the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics. Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.|$|E
5|$|The B-1 {{was first}} envisioned in the 1960s as a {{platform}} that would combine the Mach 2 speed of the B-58 Hustler with the range and payload of the B-52, and would ultimately replace both bombers. After {{a long series of}} studies, Rockwell International (now part of Boeing) won the design contest for what emerged as the B-1A. This version had a top speed of Mach 2.2 at high altitude and the capability of flying for long distances at Mach 0.85 at very low altitudes. The combination of the high cost of the aircraft, the introduction of the AGM-86 ALCM cruise missile that flew the same basic profile, and early work on the <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber</b> all significantly affected the need for the B-1. This led to the program being cancelled in 1977, after the B-1A prototypes had been built.|$|E
25|$|In October 2012 a RQ-170 {{was used}} to conduct bomb damage {{assessment}} for a test drop of a Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb from a Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber.</b>|$|E

50|$|At 3:00 AM, ten USAF F-117 Nighthawk <b>stealth</b> <b>bombers,</b> {{under the}} {{protection}} of a three-ship formation of EF-111s, bombed Baghdad, the capital. The striking force came under fire from 3,000 anti-aircraft guns firing from rooftops in Baghdad.|$|R
25|$|In 2001, federal {{investigators}} probed NG for fraud {{of more than}} $100 million, systematic overcharging for radar jammers and other high-tech devices used in the B-1 bomber, the F-15 fighter and the B-2 <b>Stealth</b> <b>bomber.</b>|$|E
25|$|Research areas {{range from}} {{experimental}} rocket propulsion to developing {{the first ever}} lithium-ion main aircraft battery {{for use in the}} B-2 <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber.</b> At Edwards AFB, the Directorate's test area is located east of Rogers Lake.|$|E
25|$|In 1991 {{the event}} moved to Waterfront Park, and Zambelli Fireworks Internationale's Master Pyrotechnician Lorenzo Alfredi began {{handling}} the fireworks. The Air Show began in 1992, and has featured such notable aircraft as the Harrier, the B-2 (<b>Stealth</b> <b>Bomber),</b> and the F-117 (Stealth Fighter) {{as well as}} the Apache Attack Helicopter.|$|E
50|$|Two days later, the UN Security Council adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 which legitimised the operation. U.S. and British {{warships}} launched {{more than}} 120 Tomahawk cruise missiles against Jamahiriya air defences and four U.S. B-2 <b>stealth</b> <b>bombers</b> attacked several airfields.|$|R
50|$|The initial strikes were {{composed}} of Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from ships, Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk <b>stealth</b> <b>bombers</b> with an armament of laser-guided bombs, and aircraft armed with anti-radar missiles. These first attacks destroyed the air defence network and allowed fighter-bombers to gain air superiority over the country.|$|R
5000|$|March 22 [...] - [...] The U.S. and the United Kingdom {{begin their}} shock-and-awe {{campaign}} {{with a massive}} air strike on military targets in Baghdad using cruise missiles fired from U.S. Navy warships, Royal Navy submarines and B-52 bombers; and laser guided missiles fired by <b>Stealth</b> <b>Bombers.</b>|$|R
25|$|During {{his career}} in Congress, he fought the MX Missile project and opposed {{expansion}} of the B-2 Spirit <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber</b> program. When President Ronald Reagan vetoed Dellums' Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-controlled Senate overrode Reagan's veto, the first override of a presidential foreign policy veto in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|However, NATO forces relied mostly {{upon the}} Americans and the proven {{effectiveness}} of its air power {{by using the}} F-16, F-15, F-117, F-14, F/A-18, EA-6B, B-52, KC-135, KC-10, AWACS, and JSTARS from bases throughout Europe and from aircraft carriers in the region. The American B-2 Spirit <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber</b> also saw its first successful combat role in Operation Allied Force, all while striking from its home base in the continental United States.|$|E
25|$|The report, {{compiled}} {{by researchers at}} the Los Alamos National Laboratory, shows that in the hands of hoaxers and conmen, red mercury can do almost anything the aspiring Third World demagogue wants it to. You want a short cut to making an atom bomb? You want the key to Soviet ballistic missile guidance systems? Or perhaps you want the Russian alternative to the anti-radar paint on the <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber?</b> What you need is red mercury.|$|E
25|$|The 509th Operations Group (509 OG) is {{the flying}} {{component}} of the United States Air Force 509th Bomb Wing (509 BW), assigned to Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. It is equipped with all 20 of the USAF's B-2 Spirit <b>stealth</b> <b>bombers.</b> Its 394th CTS also uses T-38 Talon trainers.|$|R
50|$|Playable {{characters}} {{available to}} the player were; a regular infantryman, or a special forces soldier driving either a tank, an armored personnel carrier (APC) or a helicopter.

25|$|The MCAS El Toro Air Show {{took place}} {{annually}} from the 1950s until 1997. It featured the U.S. Navy Blue Angels, {{as well as}} the USAF Thunderbirds. The Air Show also featured new aircraft that were coming into active service, such as the B-2 <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber.</b> Other displays featured military vehicles. The show also had a large gathering of vendors of military items and memorabilia. The final Air Show in 1997 drew an estimated two million visitors.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Marrett {{returned}} from Vietnam and joined Hughes Aircraft Company as an experimental test pilot. For {{the next twenty}} years, he flew test programs which helped develop attack radar and missiles for the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-18 Hornet, and {{an early version of}} the B-2 <b>Stealth</b> <b>bomber.</b> He also flew test missions for the Hughes Aircraft AGM-65 Maverick missile. Marrett has flown over 40 types of military aircraft and logged over 9,500 hours.|$|E
25|$|The 509th Bomb Group was redesignated as the 509th Operations Group and {{activated}} on 12 March 1993 {{as part of}} the 509th Bomb Wing's reorganization {{under the}} USAF Objective Wing plan. All flying squadrons, as well as an Operational Support Squadron (OSS) were assigned to the 509th OG. The first B-2 Spirit <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber</b> arrived and was assigned to the 509th on 17 December 1993 (the date was the 49th anniversary of the activation of the 509th Composite Group and the 90th of the Wright brothers' flight).|$|E

5000|$|It {{is unclear}} if other NATO leaders {{approved}} the strike. A {{report by the}} French Ministry of Defense after the war stated that [...] "part of the military operations were conducted by the United States outside the strict framework of NATO" [...] and that a dual-track command structure existed. NATO had no authority over the B-2 <b>stealth</b> <b>bombers</b> that carried out the strike.|$|R
50|$|During Operation Desert Storm, B-52s used RAF Fairford as {{a forward}} {{operating}} base. Fairford {{was also used}} during Operation Allied Force in 1999, and during the 2003 Iraq War. During these three conflicts, the Fairford was the home to B-52s, along with the B-1 Lancer, and KC-135 aircraft, and their support personnel. In recent years Fairford {{has been used by}} Air Combat Command B-2 Spirit <b>stealth</b> <b>bombers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following its trip to Arlington, Michigan {{hosted the}} Air Force Falcons in its home opener. This {{was the first}} meeting between the teams since Michigan's season opener in 1964, which the Wolverines won 24–7. Pre-game festivities {{featured}} a trio of flyovers: a flight by three University of Michigan Survival Flight helicopters, a flight by the bald eagle Challenger, and a B-2 <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber.</b> Prior to the game, Michigan reactivated Bennie Oosterbaan's number (#47) and honored him as a Michigan Football Legend. Linebacker Jake Ryan was given Oosterbaan's number following {{the conclusion of the}} ceremony.|$|E
25|$|By 1976, these {{programs}} progressed to where a long-range strategic <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber</b> appeared viable. President Carter {{was aware of}} these developments during 1977, and {{it appears to have}} been one of the major reasons the B-1 was canceled. Further studies were ordered in early 1978, by which point the Have Blue platform had flown and proven the concepts. During the 1980 presidential election campaign in 1979, Ronald Reagan repeatedly stated that Carter was weak on defense, and used the B-1 as a prime example. In return, on 22 August 1980, the Carter administration publicly disclosed that the United States Department of Defense was working to develop stealth aircraft, including a bomber.|$|E
25|$|During {{the decade}} several {{military}} projects went into production, including Boeing {{support of the}} stealth B-2 bomber. As part of an industry team led by Northrop, Boeing built the outboard portion of the B-2 <b>stealth</b> <b>bomber</b> wing, the aft center fuselage section, landing gear, fuel system and weapons delivery system. At its peak in 1991, the B-2 was the largest military program at Boeing, employing about 10,000 people. The same year, the National Aeronautic Association of the USA awarded the B-2 design team the Collier Trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in America. The first B-2 rolled out of the bomber's final assembly facility in Palmdale, California, in November 1988 and it flew {{for the first time}} on July 17, 1989.|$|E
50|$|The initial strikes were {{composed}} of Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from warships {{situated in the}} Persian Gulf, F-117A Nighthawk <b>stealth</b> <b>bombers</b> with an armament of laser-guided smart bombs, and F-4G Wild Weasel aircraft armed with HARM anti-radar missiles. These first attacks allowed F-14, F-15, F-16, and F/A-18 fighter bombers to gain air superiority {{over the country and}} then continue to drop TV and laser-guided bombs.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the deteriorating}} {{airfield}} facilities and its unique NATO heavy bomber mission, RAF Fairford underwent a $100 million upgrade of its runway and fuel {{systems in the}} largest NATO funded airfield construction project within a NATO country {{since the end of}} the Cold War. This work lasted from May 2000 through May 2002. Additional improvements continued until 2008, including the construction of two climate-controlled hangars for B-2 <b>stealth</b> <b>bombers</b> and a low-observability maintenance dock.|$|R
50|$|Megalodon - Diabolus Darkdoom’s huge stealth {{submarine}} {{which is}} the largest sub ever constructed and was used to save Otto and his friends in Escape Velocity and in Zero Hour. It is a completely self-sufficient vessel that can operate without resupply for years at a time and has the sonar signature of a torpedo, indicating that its anti-sonar technology and construction may have been based on the B2 <b>stealth</b> <b>bombers</b> anti-radar design.|$|R
