50|$|The pressure-balanced <b>shower</b> <b>valve</b> {{compensates}} {{for changes in}} water pressure. It has a diaphragm or piston inside that reacts to relative changes in either hot or cold water pressure to maintain balanced pressure. As water pressure drops on one supply line, the valve reduces the pressure in the other supply line to match. A side effect {{of this is that}} the pressure and flow at the shower head or tub spigot will drop twice as much as if only one supply line had been affected, but without a large temperature change. There are ball bearings in the valves to regulate forces.|$|E
40|$|Bimetallic {{valve stem}} {{positions}} orifice {{at end of}} inner pipe orifice so liquid flows to outlet when temperature lies within small range of preset value. If liquid too cold or too hot, orifices misaligned and liquid returned to source. Such as in <b>shower,</b> <b>valve</b> prevents outflow of dangerously hot or uncomfortably cold water...|$|E

In view of {{the present}} that this defect of water heater <b>shower</b> <b>valve</b> of the water {{temperature}} does not direct the user to the water temperature and can't maintain a constant outlet water temperature for long time, innovating {{a new type of}} water temperature control device. The adjusting device used the system of single chip microcomputer STC 89 C 52 as the core, real-time water temperature and hot and cold water temperature were collected by digital temperature sensor DS 18 B 20, adjusted with PID control method, drive motor drive the angle of opening and closing of the blade in mechanism device, to change the water volume of the hot and cold water. the purpose of keeping water temperature gain on the userâ€™s required temperature and keeping constant temperature, through data experiment shows that the adjustment system structure is simple, running accurate effective and adjusting the steady and fast...|$|E

50|$|In the Second World War, all <b>shower</b> <b>valves</b> for British {{military}} {{use were}} made by them. By 1950 the Leonard brand of shower equipment was becoming the main brand used for institutional buildings - schools and hospitals. This was due to persuading the Ministry of Education to install temperature-regulated showers. The thermostatic mixing valves were not just used for showers but for general heating of water, including their thermostatic steam water heaters.|$|R
