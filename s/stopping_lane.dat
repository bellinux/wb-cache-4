50|$|TEDES {{equipment}} is an integrated speed camera, red light camera and automatic number plate recognition device. Mounted beside or over a road, it detects violations of traffic regulation such as speeding and red light running. Other capabilities of TEDES are monitoring of driving on emergency <b>stopping</b> <b>lane</b> and parking violations. The system {{is linked to}} an automated ticketing service.|$|E
50|$|A {{shoulder}}, or {{hard shoulder}} {{is an emergency}} <b>stopping</b> <b>lane</b> by {{the verge of a}} road or motorway, on the right in countries which drive on the right, or on the left side in Japan, the UK, Australia, and other left-side driving countries. Many wider US as well as Swedish freeways have shoulders on both sides of each directional carriageway, in the median {{as well as at the}} outer edges of the road, for additional safety. Shoulders are not intended for use by through traffic, although there are exceptions (see below).|$|E
50|$|Filtering or {{filtering}} forward describes {{moving through}} traffic that is <b>stopped.</b> <b>Lane</b> splitting means riding between two lanes of vehicles, while filtering can also refer to using {{space on the}} outside edge of same-direction traffic.|$|R

40|$|Stations on Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lines ordinarily {{control line}} {{capacity}} because {{they act as}} bottlenecks. At stations with passing lanes, congestion may occur when buses maneuvering {{into and out of}} the platform <b>stopping</b> <b>lane</b> interfere with bus flow, or when a queue of buses forms upstream of the station blocking inflow. We contend that, as bus inflow to the station area approaches capacity, queuing will become excessive in a manner similar to operation of a minor movement on an unsignalized intersection. This analogy is used to treat BRT station operation and to analyze the relationship between station queuing and capacity. In the first of three stages, we conducted microscopic simulation modeling to study and analyze operating characteristics of the station under near steady state conditions through output variables of capacity, degree of saturation and queuing. A mathematical model was then developed to estimate the relationship between average queue and degree of saturation and calibrated for a specified range of controlled scenarios of mean and coefficient of variation of dwell time. Finally, simulation results were calibrated and validated...|$|E

5000|$|The {{dwell time}} can be reduced by traffic legislation. E. g. in the Czech Republic, the drivers in the running traffic lane are obliged to enable to the bus to leave the bus stop, but this {{obligation}} applies only in built up area. The Czech technical standards from 1970s and 1990s (ČSN 73 6425) preferred to build bus bays at all classes of roads, the new version ČSN 73 6425-1 from 2007 prefers bus stops in the running lane within traffic calming concept. On roads of higher classes, bus bays or bus <b>stop</b> <b>lanes</b> are obliged.|$|R

The director of Antigen, Dr. Jacob Lane, is trying to perfect the Lycan race and wants Eve's DNA to do so. The [...] "Super-Lycan" [...] Selene faced earlier is identified as Quint - Lane's son and the prototype for Lycan modifications. Selene and Sebastian infiltrate Antigen to <b>stop</b> <b>Lane's</b> plan and manage to save Eve. Selene comes across Subject 0, who she identifies as Michael and attempts to free him by shooting his cryogenic tank. However, she is forced to leave the thawing Michael {{in order to stop}} the Lycans from escaping with Eve. After confronting Lane and his son, Selene fights Lane's son and kills him by implanting a silver grenade in his stomach, whilst Eve kills Lane by ripping out his throat. Selene and Eve return to Michael's tank and find it empty with the ice shattered. Selene states that the world will be hunting Michael and the pair vow to find him first.|$|R
