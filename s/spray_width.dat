A two-dimensional automatic measurement system, which consisted of a conveying unit, a system control unit, an ultrasonic sensor, and a deposition collecting dish, was designed and developed. The system could precisely move an ultrasonic sensor above a pesticide deposition collecting dish to measure the nozzle flow distribution. A sensor sleeve with a PVC tube was designed for the ultrasonic sensor to limit its beam angle in order to measure the liquid level in the small troughs. System performance tests were conducted to verify the designed functions and measurement accuracy. A commercial spray nozzle was also used to measure its flow distribution. The test results showed that the relative error on volume measurement was less than 7. 27 % when the liquid volume was 2 mL in trough, while the error was less than 4. 52 % when the liquid volume was 4 mL or more. The developed system was also used to evaluate the flow distribution of a commercial nozzle.

This paper proposes an innovative method of biological protection of corn against Ostrinia nubilalis with the use of an autogyro and presents the results of these operations. An autogyro adaptation for forest applications is proposed, and the preliminary results of a spray uniformity assessment are presented. Based on a two-year study (542. 5 ha), the introduction of the Tricholet preparation against Ostrinia nubilalis was found to be highly effective (73. 55 %), which is a positive indication for the innovative autogyro method for introducing Trichogramma evanescens.

Automatic CAD-guided tool planning has many applications in surface manufacturing, such as spray painting, spray forming and indirect rapid tooling.

Nonetheless, research on spray breakup mechanism under low pressure in pharmaceutical industry is still relatively rare. Numerical model in the Lagrangian approach was modified for simulating the spray formation from a nasal spray device in the current study.

The ground wheel drive mechanism ensures that the output of the sprayer is proportional to forward movement; variation in walking speed does not affect the rate of application. Both <b>spray</b> band <b>width</b> and droplet size are adjustable, enabling efficient application of the herbicide and reducing drift.

40|$|An Euler–Lagrange {{model is}} {{presented}} {{that describes the}} dynamics of liquid droplets emerging from a high-pressure spray nozzle in a relatively large volume (of the order of almost a cubic meter). In the model, the gas phase is treated as continuum, solved on an Eulerian grid, and the liquid phase is treated as a dispersed phase, solved in a Lagrangian fashion, with interphase coupling through state-of-the-art drag relations obtained from direct numerical simulations. The droplets are introduced into the system at high velocities, leading to a turbulent self-induced gas flow which is solved using large eddy simulation. Despite the relatively low liquid volume fraction in the spray, the number density of droplets at the nozzle is still more than 1010 m- 3, {{which is why we}} employ a highly efficient stochastic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach to track collisions between droplets. The droplet collision frequency is calculated on the basis of local droplet number density, droplet size and relative velocities of neighbouring droplets within a dynamically adapting searching scope, as described in Pawar et al. (2014. Chem. Eng. Sci. 105, 132 – 142). We use known correlations from literature to determine the outcome of a binary droplet collision, which depending on characteristic dimensionless numbers can be coalescence, bouncing or, for high velocity impacts, stretching or reflexive separation leading to formation of satellite droplets.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} and understand drift from field sprayers, a steady state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed. The model was developed in 3 D {{in order to increase}} the understanding of the causes of drift: a deviation in the wind direction cannot be captured by a 2 D approach, the wake behind a wind screen is not symmetrical, the effects of a changed nozzle orientation may not be symmetrical. The model's accuracy was validated with field experiments carried out according to the international standard ISO 22866. A field sprayer with a <b>spray</b> boom <b>width</b> of 27 in and 54 nozzles (Hardi ISO F 1 10 - 03 at 3 bar) was driving at 2. 22 m/s over a flat pasture. During the experiments the wind direction was perpendicular to the tractor track. The model explained the variation in drift replicates during each single field experiment through varying boom height (0. 3 - 0. 7 m), wind velocity (1. 3 - 2. 5 m/s), wind deviation (- 18 degrees to + 18 degrees) from the direction perpendicular to the tractor track and injection velocity of the droplets (17 - 27 m/s). Boom movements had the highest impact on the variations in drift values (deviations in drift deposits of 25 %), followed by variation in wind velocity (deviations in drift deposits of 3 %) and injection velocity of the droplets (deviations in drift deposits of 2. 5 %). Wind deviation from the direction perpendicular to the tractor track had a reducing effect on the drift values (deviations in drift deposits of 2 %). Small variations in driving speed had little influence on drift values. Near drift (< 5 m) is predicted well by the model but the increased complexity compromised the predictions at greater distances. The model will be further developed in order to improve far drift prediction. Dynamic simulations will be performed and the model for turbulent dispersion will be optimized. The model did not require calibration. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

This study provides the development and characterization of custom-made spray nozzles {{that could serve as}} a foundation {{for the development of a}} BioAirbrush, a platform technology for the arthroscopic application of (cell laden) hydrogels. Materials and Methods: Custom-made spray nozzles were designed and produced with 3 D printing technology. A commercially available spraying system was used for comparison. Sprays were characterized based on <b>spray</b> angle, cone <b>width,</b> droplet size, velocity, and density. This was performed with conventional and high-speed imaging. Furthermore, cell survival of chondrocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells, as well as the chondrogenic capacity of chondrocytes after spraying were evaluated. Results: Changing nozzle design from internal to external mixing significantly increased cell survival after spraying. Custom-made spray nozzles provide larger droplets compared to the current commercially available technology, potentially improving cell survival. Sufficient mixing of two gel components was confirmed for the custom-made nozzles. Overall, custom-made nozzles improved cell survival after spraying, without significantly affecting the chondrogenic capacity of the cells. Conclusions: This study provides a platform for the development of a BioAirbrush for spray-assisted cell implantations in arthroscopic cartilage repair procedures. Evaluation of the fundamental characteristics of a spray as well as a study of cell survival after spraying have further expanded the knowledge regarding cell spraying for cartilage repair.

40|$|Abstract Background: Many {{infectious}} diseases that cause significant morbidity and mortality, {{especially in the}} developing world, could be preventable through vaccination. The effort to produce safe, thermally stable, and needle-free mucosal vaccines has become increasingly important for global health considerations. We have previously demonstrated that a thermally stable nanoemulsion, a mucosal adjuvant for needle-free nasal immunization, is safe and induces protective immunity {{with a variety of}} antigens, including recombinant protein. The successful use of nanoemulsion-based vaccines, however, poses numerous challenges. Among the challenges is optimization of the formulation to maintain thermal stability and potency and another is accuracy and efficiency of dispensing the vaccines to the nasal mucosa in the anterior and turbinate region of the nasal cavity or potentially to the nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue. Methods: We have examined the effects of different diluents [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 0. 9 % NaCl] on the stability and potency of nanoemulsion-based vaccines. In addition, we have determined the efficiency of delivering them using commercially available nasal spray devices (Pfeiffer SAP- 62602 multidose pump and the BD Hypak SCF 0. 5 ?ml unit dose AccusprayTM). Results: We report the stability and potency of PBS?diluted ovalbumin?nanomeulsion mixtures for up to 8 months and NaCl-diluted mixtures up to 6 months when stored at room temperature. Significant differences in spray characteristics including droplet size, <b>spray</b> angle, plume <b>width,</b> and ovality ratios were observed between the two pumps. Further, we have demonstrated that the nanoemulsion-based vaccines are not physically or chemically altered and retain potency following actuation with nasal spray devices. Using either device, the measured spray characteristics suggest deposition of nanoemulsion-based vaccines in inductive tissues located in the anterior region of the nasal cavity.

40|$|In recent years, {{advances}} in plant protection have contributed considerably to increasing crop yields in a sustainable way. Easy to apply and rather inexpensive, pesticides {{have proven to}} be very efficient. However, when pesticides are applied to crops some of the spray may not reach the target, but move outside the intended spray area. This can cause serious economic and environmental problems. Most of the pesticides are applied using agricultural sprayers. These sprayers use hydraulic nozzles which break the liquid into droplets {{with a wide range of}} droplet sizes and velocities and determine the spray pattern. Small droplets are prone to wind drift, while large droplets can runoff from the target surface and deposit on the soil. Therefore, efforts are being undertaken to come to a more sustainable use of pesticides which is more and more regulated by international environmental laws. One of the main challenges is to reduce spray losses and maximize spray deposition and efficacy by improving the spray characteristics and the spray application process. Because mechanisms of droplets leaving a hydraulic spray nozzle are very complex and difficult to quantify or model, there is a need for accurate quantification techniques. The recent improvements in digital image processing, sensitivity of imaging systems and cost reduction have increased the interest in high-speed (HS) imaging techniques for agricultural applications in general and for pesticide applications in specific. This thesis focused on the development and application of high speed imaging techniques to measure micro (droplet size and velocity) and macro (spray angle and shape, liquid sheet length) spray characteristics. The general aim was to show that the spray characteristics from agricultural spray nozzles can be measured correctly with the developed imaging techniques in a non-intrusive way. After a review of the spray application process and techniques for spray characterization (Chapter 2), two image acquisition systems were developed in Chapter 3 based on single droplet experiments using a high speed camera and a piezoelectric droplet generator. 58 combinations of lenses, light sources, diffusers, and exposure times were tested using shadowgraph (background) imaging and evaluated based on image quality parameters (signal to noise rate, entropy ratio and contrast ratio), light stability and overexposure ratio and the accuracy of the droplet size measurement. These resulted into development of two image acquisition systems for measuring the macro and micro spray characteristics. The HS camera with a macro video zoom lens at a working distance of 143 mm with a larger field of view (FOV) of 88 mm x 110 mm in combination with a halogen spotlight and a diffuser was selected for measuring the macro spray characteristics (spray angle, spray shape and liquid sheet length). The optimal set-up for measuring micro spray characteristics (droplet size and velocity) consisted of a high speed camera with a 6 µs exposure time, a microscope lens at a working distance of 430 mm resulting in a FOV of 10. 5 mm x 8. 4 mm, and a xenon light source used as a backlight without diffuser. In Chapter 4 image analysis and processing algorithms were developed for measuring single droplet characteristics (size and velocity) and different approaches for image segmentation were presented. With the set-up for micro spray characterization and using these dedicated image analysis algorithms (Chapter 4), measurements using a single droplet generator in droplet on demand (DOD) and continuous mode were performed in Chapter 5. The effects of the operating parameters, including voltage pulse width and pulse amplitude with 4 nozzle orifice sizes (261 µm, 123 µm, 87 µm and 67 µm) on droplet diameter and droplet velocity have been characterized. The experiments in DOD mode have shown that the initial droplet characteristics from the droplet generator are a function of the double pulse width (absorption time (ta) and pulsation time (tp)) and the orifice size. By changing pulse width, it was possible to control droplet velocity and size. In general, decrease of ta and increase of tp increased the droplet diameter. Similarly, increasing the nozzle orifice size increased the droplet diameter. With the DOD mode, droplet sizes ranged between 134. 1 μm and 461. 5 μm. Foremost, the smallest and the fastest droplets were measured with the smallest nozzle orifice. The measured droplet velocities ranged between 0. 08 m/s and 1. 78 m/s. Besides, an effect of the pulse amplitude on the droplet diameter and velocity was noticed. The ratio of the droplet diameter and nozzle orifice in DOD mode ranged from 1. 3 to 3. 5. The continuous mode for every nozzle was established for a high frequency (kHz) resulting in a continuous droplet generation. This frequency together with different pulse amplitudes were used to test the effect on the droplet diameter, inter-droplet spacing and velocity. As for the DOD mode, the droplet diameter was mainly controlled by the nozzle orifice. The droplet size here was between 167. 2 μm and 455. 8 μm. Furthermore, the nozzle orifice also influenced the droplet velocity i. e., the bigger the nozzle orifice was, the higher the droplet velocity. Obviously, there was a linear trend between the droplet diameter and velocity in continuous mode. The ratios between the droplet diameter and the nozzle orifice ranged from 1. 3 to 3. 9. In continuous mode, the lowest droplet velocity of 1. 84 m/s was measured with the smallest nozzle orifice size while the highest droplet velocity of 4. 66 m/s was measured with the biggest nozzle orifice size. Based on the results in both modes, similar droplet sizes were produced in both modes but in continuous mode it was possible to achieve faster droplets which correspond better with real spray application. In Chapter 6, the image acquisition technique for measuring micro spray characteristics was used for measuring the droplet size and velocity characteristics of agricultural hydraulic spray nozzles. This included the development of an in-focus droplet criterion based on the gray level gradient to decide whether a droplet is in focus or not. Differently sized droplets generated with a piezoelectric generator and glass nozzles in continuous mode at different distances from the focal plane and lens using a micro translation stage were measured. This enabled measurement of the gray level gradient and in-focus parameter for every droplet size at different positions. From here, a critical in-focus parameter (Infc) was established for every droplet size and an in-focus droplet criterion was deduced to decide whether a droplet is in focus or not depending on its diameter and in-focus parameter. In this study the focused droplet zone (FDZ) was defined as the zone in which a droplet with a certain diameter is in focus and a linear relation between droplet size and FDZ was found. The developed in-focus droplet criterion was applied to spray images of five nozzles taken at different positions: two standard flat fan nozzles (XR 110 01 & 04 at 400 kPa), an air inclusion nozzle (AI 110 04 at 400 kPa) and two hollow cone nozzles (ATR orange at 600 kPa and red at 800 kPa). The effects of nozzle type, nozzle size and measuring position on droplet size and velocity characteristics were studied. The droplet size and velocity results from the imaging technique have shown that it is possible to measure the spray characteristics in a nonintrusive way using an image acquisition set-up and image processing. Measured droplet sizes ranged from 24 µm to 543 µm depending on the nozzle type and size. Droplet velocities at 0. 5 m below the nozzle ranged from 0. 5 m/s up to 12 m/s. Spray droplet size characteristics such as DV 0. 1, DV 0. 5, DV 0. 9 and RSF as well as spray velocity characteristics such as VVol 10, VVol 50, VVol 90 and VSF, were extracted from the images. Similar effects of nozzle type and measuring position on droplet sizes as well as on droplet velocities were found with the imaging technique as with the Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) laser technique. The developed imaging technique can be seen as an alternative to the well-established PDPA laser technique. The droplet diameter and velocity characteristics showed a relatively good comparison with the results measured with the PDPA laser. When compared with the PDPA laser, the imaging technique generally measured less small droplets and in some cases also less big droplets. Differences between both techniques can be attributed to the fact that the smallest measured droplet size with the imaging system is 24 µm while smaller droplets are measured with the PDPA. In addition, the number of droplets measured with the imaging technique was much smaller compared with the PDPA which increases the chance to miss one of the biggest droplets. This can be improved by taking more images. Differences in droplet velocity characteristics between both techniques can be attributed to the fact that the PDPA laser is only measuring droplet velocity in one dimension and hence underestimates the actual droplet velocity. In addition, the imaging technique applied did not allow the measurement of droplets faster than about 12 m/s based on FOV and the acquisition rate while some droplets with higher speeds were observed with the PDPA mainly for the XR 110 04. In future, the imaging system can be further improved to be able to measure at a higher frame rate with the same accuracy. In Chapter 7, the image acquisition system for macro spray characterization was used to measure the spray angle, spray shape and liquid sheet length of the same nozzle-pressures combinations as mentioned above. Where possible, the results were compared with the existing non-imaging measuring techniques like a horizontal patternator. The measured spray angles were higher than the nominal spray angle except for the XR 110 01 nozzle. For the hollow cone (ATR orange and red) and air inclusion nozzle (AI 110 04), the imaging technique gave a good comparison of the spray angle while the spray angle was underestimated for both standard flat fan nozzles (XR 110 01 & 04). The shortest liquid sheet was found for the XR 110 01 nozzle (18. 5 mm), followed by the two hollow cone nozzles (27. 4 and 31. 3 mm). The longest liquid sheets were found for the XR 110 04 (38. 9 mm) and AI 110 04 (43. 1 mm). In addition, from the spray shape, the <b>spray</b> pattern <b>width</b> at four heights (5, 10, 15 and 20 cm) of all selected nozzles and the corresponding spray angles were calculated and compared with the results from the horizontal patternator. For the spray angle, a good correspondence between imaging technique and patternator was found with relative errors of 0. 5 % for the XR 110 01, 0. 6 % for the XR 110 01 and AI 110 04 and 2. 8 % and 5. 4 % for the ATR orange and ATR red, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{transient}} behaviour {{of the fuel}} spray from an air assisted fuel injector has been investigated both numerically and experimentally in a Constant Volume Chamber (CVC) and an optical engine. This two phase injector is difficult to analyse numerically and experimentally because of the strong coupling between the gas and liquid phases. The gas driven atomization of liquid fuel involves liquid film formation, separation and break up and also liquid droplet coalescence, break up, splashing, bouncing, evaporation and collision. Furthermore, the liquid phase is the dominant phase in many regions within the injector. Experimental results are obtained by using Mie scattering, Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and Laser Sheet Drop sizing (LSD) techniques. Computational results are obtained by using a mixed Lagrangian/Eulerian approach in a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) code. Injector rig results show a good atomization of the spray with low <b>spray</b> <b>width</b> and penetration and Sauter Mean Diameters SMD) of droplets of order 10 μm.

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] study of normal and lateral spray penetration for small-diameter, high-pressure, liquid jets issuing {{at an angle to}} a uniform supersonic stream is reported. The experimental program was carried out in the 4 -in. by 4 -in. blowdown supersonic wind tunnel of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. The flowfield is observed by means of a schlieren system, and the spray distribution is indicated by the light scattered by the liquid droplets. Data on normal penetration, in good agreement with data inferred front other investigations, indicate that a single-parameter correlation exists between the properly nondimensionalized penetration height and the injection pressure ratio. Injecting the coolant at a forward angle to the flow produces no substantial change in the penetration height. The data on lateral penetration show the <b>spray</b> <b>width</b> behind the jet to the proportional to the jet diameter with only a weak dependence on the injection pressure ratio.

The plots (each 10  m 2) for the first 6 treatments were {{set up in a}} randomized complete block design (5 by 6) with 5 replicates each, while the plots for treatment 7 and 8 were set up in a chessboard-like pattern (3 by 4) with 6 replicates each. Treatments were applied at the following BBCH growth stages [29] with 2  weeks in between: first spray at stage 69 (end of flowering), second spray at stage 77 (~[*] 70 % of pods have final length), and third spray at stage 79 (during seed filling). This application sequence was selected based on the recommendations for Zn on wheat [5]. Treatments 1 – 6 were applied at all three spray occasions, while T 7 and T 8 were only applied at second and third sprays. Spray application was done in the early mornings (after sunrise) at 500  L ha− 1 (equivalent to 1.3  mL/plant) using a pressure-regulated knapsack sprayer equipped with a double (spray 1) or single even fan nozzle (spray 2 and 3), each nozzle having <b>spray</b> <b>width</b> 0.5  m.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the breakup {{behavior}} of swirling liquid sheets discharging from gas-centered swirl coaxial atomizers with attention focused toward {{the understanding of the}} role of central gas jet on the liquid sheet breakup. Cold flow experiments on the liquid sheet breakup were carried out by employing custom fabricated gas-centered swirl coaxial atomizers using water and air as experimental fluids. Photographic techniques were employed to capture the flow behavior of liquid sheets at different flow conditions. Quantitative variation on the breakup length of the liquid sheet and <b>spray</b> <b>width</b> were obtained from the measurements deduced from the images of liquid sheets. The sheet breakup process is significantly influenced by the central air jet. It is observed that low inertia liquid sheets are more vulnerable to the presence of the central air jet and develop shorter breakup lengths at smaller values of the air jet Reynolds number Re-g. High inertia liquid sheets ignore the presence of the central air jet at smaller values of Re-g and eventually develop shorter breakup lengths at higher values of Re-g. The experimental evidences suggest that the central air jet causes corrugations on the liquid sheet surface, which may be promoting the production of thick liquid ligaments from the sheet surface. The level of surface corrugations on the liquid sheet increases with increasing Re-g. Qualitative analysis of experimental observations reveals that the entrainment process of air established between the inner surface of the liquid sheet and the central air jet is the primary trigger for the sheet breakup...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} fluid dynamic {{behaviour}} of a specific spray nozzle used in the evaporator unit of the Tetra Pak A 6 iLine, as well as a sensitivity analysis and methodology development for general evaporating sprays used in industrial applications. The Tetra Pak A 6 is a complete sterilisation, filling and packaging machine for the Tetra Evero Aseptic carton bottle. The package is specially designed for ambient white milk. It is developed to be more user friendly than old fashion prism shaped packages due to the easier handling and reclosing feature and more environmental friendly than plastic bottles due to the separable carton body and plastic top. A spray nozzle in the evaporator injects a high-speed liquid mixture of water and hydrogen peroxide that is evaporated, swirled down into the carton bottle and used as aseptic treatment of the inside of the package before the vapor mixture is vented out and the package is filled with beverage. The behaviour of the multicomponent spray was numerically modeled using unsteady RANS and Lagrangian tracking of representative computational parcels of spray droplets. The simulations were performed using STAR-CCM+, a software package for computational fluid dynamic simulations. To break down the complex fluid dynamic problem in the high-speed spray nozzle and be able to isolate and study important physical phenomenon, two different case studies with simplified geometries were performed. The first case study was a parameter and sensitivity analysis of the behaviour of a general evaporating spray in a small cubical domain. The injector is a solid cone injector originating from a single point. Responses such as penetration length, <b>spray</b> <b>width,</b> evaporated mass for the species, diameter- and velocity distributions were studied for varying spray parameters and solver settings. The second case study originates from an experimental and numerical study of wall impingement of diesel spray in an open channel with cross flow [3]. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effect of droplet-droplet collisions, wall interaction and fluid film. The conclusions from the case studies were applied to spray simulations of the nozzle and evaporator in the Tetra Pak A 6. Comparison with experimental droplet velocities and diameters from laser measurements showed acceptable conformity. The ambition is that the results from the aforementioned studies could be used for sprays in other industrial applications such as diesel or urea spray in the automotive industry since these applications use the same models for simulating spray behaviour...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims at {{studying}} {{the breakup of}} swirling liquid sheets discharging from the outer orifice of gas centered swirl coaxial atomizers. Such atomizers are considered as propellant injection systems for semi-cryogenic liquid rocket engines. A gas centered swirl coaxial type atomizer discharges an annular swirling liquid sheet which is atomized by a gaseous jet issuing from the central orifice of the atomizer. The primary objectives of this work were to understand the fluid dynamic interaction process between the outer liquid sheet and the central gas jet and its role on the breakup process of the liquid sheet. Cold flow experiments were carried out by constructing custom made gas centered swirl coaxial atomizers. Two different atomizer configurations with varying swirl effect were studied. The jets were injected into ambient atmospheric air medium with tap water and air as experimental fluids. The flow conditions were {{described in terms of}} Weber number (Wel) and Reynolds number (Reg) for liquid sheet and the air jet respectively. Spray images were captured by employing an image acquisition system comprising a high resolution digital camera and a strobe lamp. The captured spray images at different combinations of Wel and Reg were analyzed to extract quantitative measurements of breakup length (Lb), spray cone angle (θs), <b>spray</b> <b>width</b> (SW) and two-dimensional surface profile of liquid sheets. Quantitative analysis of the variation of Lb with Reg with different values of Wel suggested that low inertia liquid sheets undergo an efficient breakup process. High inertia liquid sheets ignore the presence of central air jet at lower values of Reg however undergo air jet breakup at higher values of Reg. Qualitative analysis of experimental observations revealed that the entrainment process, established between the inner surface of the liquid sheet and the boundary of central jet, triggers the air assisted sheet breakup by drawing the liquid sheet closer to the spray axis. The entrainment process may be developing corrugations on the surface of liquid sheet which promotes the production of thick liquid ligaments from the sheet surface. The level of surface corrugations on the liquid sheet, quantified by means of tortuosity of liquid sheet profile, increases with increasing Reg. Limited studies on the effect of variation swirl intensity on the air assisted breakup process of liquid sheets did not show any significant influence for the atomizers examined in the present work...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the continuous development and improvement of the conventional diesel combustion process, the so-called homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion is a promising combustion concept that intents to simultaneously reduce NOx and soot emissions. In this process a homogeneous mixture of air and fuel is burnt, {{in a way that}} the ignition starts at the same time throughout the combustion chamber. The main challenges of the HCCI combustion at high load are the control of the ignition timing and combustion and the homogenization of air, fuel and recirculated exhaust gases before the ignition begin. The use of specific fuel compositions could help to overcome these challenges. The resistance to auto-ignition of fuels with low cetane number can increase ignition delay and therefore provide sufficient time for air and fuel to mix homogenously. Also, the increase of volatility can improve the air-fuel mixture rate due to quick evaporation. Moreover, choosing a suitable nozzle geometry or a matching injection strategy are potential approaches to enhance the control and expand the operation window of HCCI combustion. The objective of this thesis is to experimentally study the influence on the mixture formation of fuel blends with low cetane number and high volatility with variable injection strategy and variable nozzle geometry in a high pressure chamber. Therefore the injection pressure and mass flow rate, macroscopic spray characteristics and quantitative parameters like droplet size and velocity are measured. The investigated fuel blends consist of a mixture of ethanol and diesel fuel and a mixture of gasoline and diesel fuel. The multiple injection strategy implemented here is a double-injection. This injection strategy simulates the interaction between a pilot injection and a main injection, a split main injection and finally a main injection and a post injection. The delay between injections will be varied for all kinds of double-injection. To investigate the influence of variable nozzle geometry on the mixture formation, an asymmetric arrangement of the injection holes was chosen in a so-called cluster configuration. Two injection holes are closely grouped with variable divergent angles between them. Using the diesel fuel blends the mixture formation was improved by varying the nozzle geometry as well as the injection strategy, which was indicated by a reduced number of droplets. Employing these strategies leads to homogenization of the air- fuel ratio of the HCCI combustion process. For varying injection strategies the measured differences between single and double injections are stronger dependent on phase shifts of shock waves generated in the injection system than on the interaction between two consecutive injections. For varying nozzle geometries, a nozzle with a 10 ° diverging angle between sprays provides the finest atomization of all investigated nozzles and generates an adequate spatial distribution of the fuel. This is achieved by a shorter penetration and therefore increased <b>spray</b> <b>width.</b> This can lead to reduced hydrocarbon emissions in HCCI combustion. Finally, it can be summarized that the measures considered in this work are promising to extend the operation range of the HCCI combustion process...|$|E
40|$|This thesis has {{provided}} {{some insight into}} spray droplet formation after atomization of a drug formulation from a nasal spray device. A commercial nasal spray device was tested under a constant flow {{in order to better}} understand its spray formation and characteristics. External characteristics such as the spray cone angle define the range of spray that exits from the device, while the internal characteristics such as the droplet size distribution help to determine the probability of inertial impaction within the nasal cavity. The experimental method makes use of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle/droplet image analysis (PDIA) to obtain droplet diameters and spray velocities in different spray regions. Image processing techniques were applied to enhance visualization and a droplet concentration field. It was shown that there is some variation in the droplet diameters with respect to its radial and axial position from the spray orifice. Empirical curve fits for the particle size distribution were formulated to allow easier adoption of the data into CFD models. The dimensions of the external spray were shown to be much larger in comparison with the dimensions of a nasal cavity, which means that only a narrow portion of the spray will fit within the narrow cross sections of the nasal cavity. The results of another unsteady spray experiment using an in-house experimental test station to simulate the hand operations by patients have showed that there are three main phases of spray development (pre-stable, stable, and post-stable) that can be correlated by examining the <b>spray</b> <b>width.</b> A comparison with a human nasal cavity is made to put into perspective the dimensions and geometry that the spray atomization produces. The spray droplet size was analysed under different back pressures to mimic the drug delivery by adult and paediatric patients. It was found that the spray droplet size from the device operated by adult has smaller averaged Sauter mean diameter (SMD) which implies better drug absorption in nasal cavity. Also, the spray cone has less variation during stable stage. By prolonging the duration of this stage can improve the drug delivery performance and stability. The outcome has extended the current existing set of data to contribute toward a better understanding in nasal spray drug delivery. The numerical part of this thesis has presented the fine-tuned spray model constants of the linear instability sheet atomization model (LISA) and evaluated its performance for low pressure application. Some parameters that were evaluated include the dispersion angle and the liquid sheet constant that influences the droplet size distribution and dispersion. The simulation results were evaluated against experimental data that has been previously performed. It was found that the LISA model provided good comparisons when a dispersion angle of 3 ◦ and a liquid sheet constant of 1 were used. In addition, three scenarios were investigated: (i) influence of fluid droplet coupling; (ii) increase in mass flow rate; and (iii) changing the orientation from downward spray to upward spray...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} single-plume sprays into cross-flowing air is found {{extensively}} in literature, however, with the continued {{development of the}} Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) engine, the behaviour of multi-plume sprays in cross-flowing conditions is of interest. In the present work, the injection of a multi-plume spray into a high-velocity cross-flow is investigated; an experimental apparatus capable of providing a cross-flow with core velocities higher than 200 m/s is developed; analysis techniques are developed to characterize the cross-flow and multi-plume spray independently; the multi-plume spray is characterized as it issues into the cross-flowing air. The round air jet used for the cross-flow was designed using the concepts put forth {{for the design of}} wind tunnel contractions. The axial and radial velocities were measured using a Particle Image Velocimetry system from LaVision Inc. and the potential core length determined for the core velocities corresponding to Mach numbers of 0. 35 and 0. 58. It was determined that the potential core length increases with increasing Mach number and that increased compressibility, leads to reduced mixing within the core. Furthermore, velocity profiles of the air jet show that self-similarity is preserved within the shear layer of the initial region. The multi-plume spray was also characterized in quiescent conditions for 10 and 15 MPa injection pressures. It was found that the penetration depth and <b>spray</b> <b>width</b> increased with increasing injection pressure, but that the spray angle decreased with increasing pressure. The increase in penetration depth is consistent with the findings presented in literature, while the decrease in spray angle with increasing pressure is contrary to literature. Next, the multi-plume spray, injected at 10 and 15 MPa, is characterized as it issues into the cross-flowing air stream at Mach numbers equal to 0. 35 and 0. 58. The tail length and penetration are measured and it is found that for the first, the cross-flow velocity is the primary factor with higher cross-flow velocity resulting in a longer tail length, while for the latter, the injection pressure is the major factor, with higher injection pressures resulting in higher penetrations. That being said, the injection pressure does play a small role in the tail length, with the 15 MPa injection having a slightly longer tail length than the 10 MPa injection in the Mach number 0. 58 cross-flow. This is attributed to the finer atomization, which is expected from the 15 MPa injection and which leads to quicker entrainment of fuel droplets into the cross-flow. The spray axis was predicted for each set of conditions from 0. 1 ms to 1. 0 ms after Start of Fuel (SOF). It was found that before 0. 3 ms, the spray retains its multi-plume nature, while after 0. 3 ms it behaves like a single-plume spray. Once the spray has crossed this transition point, the spray axis is temporally independent and can be predicted by the logarithmic models, similar to those used for single-plume sprays in cross-flow. The accuracy of this fit is improved upon, with the presentation of a modified correlation, which includes the momentum flux ratio inside of the logarithmic term. Finally, the multi-plume spray issuing into the cross-flow is characterized using PIV to measure droplet velocities. It is observed that the cross-flow momentum is imparted to the smaller droplets within the 15 MPa spray more easily than to those of the 10 MPa injection, but that the 15 MPa sprays also retain their momentum in the radial direction longer than the 10 MPa sprays. As such, the 10 MPa sprays align with the cross-flow axis faster. 1 yea...|$|E
