The research indicates that other independent layers of protection, as a supplementary, can safeguard the public <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring</b> system lacking of protection. The number of people in a public place is not considered in the optimized three-dimension risk matrix which causes the SIL derived from the three-dimension risk matrix to be rather backward-looking.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a structural <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring</b> model of a dam {{is necessary for the}} evaluation of the dam’s deformation status. The structural <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring</b> method based on the monitoring data is widely used in traditional research. On the basis of the analysis of the high arch dam’s deformation principles, this study proposes a structural <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring</b> method derived from the dam deformation monitoring data. The method first analyzes and establishes the spatial and temporal distribution of high arch dam’s <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring,</b> overcoming the standard artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm’s shortcoming of easily falling into the local optimum by adopting the adaptive proportion and average Euclidean distance afterwards. The improved ABC algorithm is used to optimize the backpropagation (BP) neural network’s initial weight and threshold. The application example proves that ABC-BP model’s improvement method is important for the {{establishment of}} a high arch deformation <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring</b> model and can effectively improve the model’s fitting and forecasting ability.

This mechanism is easy to implement and low-cost compared to other more theoretically based mechanisms such as Kalman filter. Experimental results show that HHMSM achieves better performance on flexibility, correctness, coverage, and lifetime compared with other existing wireless mine <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems.

The optimal data model was confirmed by identifying data objects, defining relations and reviewing entities. The conversion of relations among entities to external keys and entities and physical attributes to tables and fields was interpreted completely. On this basis, a multi-dimensional database that reflects the management and analysis of a dam <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring</b> system on monitoring data information has been established, for which factual tables and dimensional tables have been designed. Finally, based on service design and user interface design, the dam <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring</b> system has been developed with Delphi as the development tool.

It is superior to other dam <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring</b> system development models and can provide a new research direction for system developers...|$|R

Based on self-regulation framework, we examined three safety-specific leader behaviours: <b>safety</b> inspiring, <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and <b>safety</b> learning on two distinct employee safety behaviours: safety participation and safety compliance. First, we demonstrated via confirmatory factor analysis that the three different safety-specific leader behaviours and the two employee safety behaviours are five distinct behavioural constructs. Then, using path analysis, we found that while safety inspiring is positively and specifically related to <b>safety</b> participation, <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring</b> is positively and specifically related to safety compliance. Further, we also showed {{that the relationship between}} <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring</b> and <b>safety</b> participation can be moderated by the degree to which leaders encourage safety related learning.
