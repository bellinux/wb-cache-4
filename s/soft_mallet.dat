50|$|Wind gongs (also {{known as}} Feng or Lion Gongs) are flat bronze discs, with little {{fundamental}} pitch, heavy tuned overtones, and long sustain. They are most commonly made of B20 bronze, {{but can also}} be made of M63 brass or NS12 nickel-silver. Traditionally, a wind gong is played with a large <b>soft</b> <b>mallet,</b> which gives it a roaring crash to match their namesake. They are lathed {{on both sides and}} are medium to large in size, typically 15 to 22 in but sizes from 7 to 60 in are available. The 22 in size is most popular due to its portability and large sound.|$|E
50|$|In 1948 Harry Partch, an American composer, {{developed}} {{a system of}} music that depended on the building of various exotic instruments that could play non-tempered scales. Some of them were based on Greek models and some on more primitive instruments like marimbas. Musician David Buck Wheat and his roommate in Sausalito, California, Bill Loughborough, a musician and electronic engineer, built such instruments for Partch as a marimba which {{was hit with a}} large <b>soft</b> <b>mallet</b> over the chamber. This device delivered low-cycled tones that were barely audible. Loughborough had scientific instruments borrowed from the Navy Yard, and using an oscilloscope and audio oscillator he and Wheat were able to work on a new technical level that had not been possible before.|$|E

50|$|The kong thom (គង់ធំ) plays a {{melodic line}} in the Cambodian pinpeat {{ensemble}} almost identical {{to that of the}} roneat thung (large xylophone). The kong thom dwells more steadily on the pulse without pulling or delaying the beat (melody). The player uses <b>soft</b> <b>mallets</b> for indoor performance, hard ones for outdoors. The kong thom is analogous to the khong wong yai used in Thailand.|$|R
5000|$|The lujon {{is played}} with <b>soft</b> <b>mallets,</b> and {{produces}} {{a sound that}} is dominated by its fundamental frequency. [...] The instrument {{is also known as}} a loo-jon or metal log drum. [...] In a 2009 Web post, Loughborough provided the following historical background: [...] "Henry Mancini's drummer, Shelly Manne had several drums I made {{and one of them was}} the Lujon (a pun on 'John Lewis' who bought the first one). Mancini was very impressed with the instrument and wrote 'Lujon' using its scale as the theme." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wheat {{had long}} been an {{advocate}} of George Russell's [...] "Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization for Improvisation", the art of tonal gravity. In 1948 Harry Partch, an American composer, developed a microtonal system of music that depended on custom-built, specialized instruments of various and exotic designs, which could play non-tempered scales, for its performance. Buckwheat (the name Wheat used in later life) and his Sausalito, California roommate Bill Loughborough, a musician and electronic engineer, built instruments for Partch, such as a marimba played with a large <b>soft</b> <b>mallet</b> over the resonator, delivering barely audible, low-Hertz tones. Loughborough borrowed diagnostic and metric instruments from the Mare Island Navy Yard; using an oscilloscope and audio oscillator, {{they were able to}} work at a technical level not previously possible. Together they moved onto a Sausalito barge with Jak Simpson, who in 1954 founded a business named the [...] "Boobam Bamboo Drum Company". Wheat, who was also working on the President Lines cruises to the Orient as a bass player, would buy large-diameter giant bamboo in the Philippines and bring them back on the ship to build the South Pacific Island bamboo drums, which they manufactured in Mill Valley, California, as Boobam's, ('bam' and 'boo' switched around). The drums fascinated several jazz groups, which added them to their percussion sections. In 1956, Chet Baker's Ensemble used them to perform on the Today Show.|$|E
3000|$|The {{nonlinearity}} of resonators {{is sometimes}} clearly audible. For example, a gong excited with a <b>soft</b> <b>mallet</b> radiates a progressively {{higher proportion of}} high-frequency energy. Cymbals have chaotic crashing sound when hit hard, and in some, the pitch glides downwards as the overall amplitude decreases. These effects can be reproduced by solving directly with finite elements [24] or more efficiently by recasting in terms of modal interactions [10, 11]. In [10], the output of each mode {{is fed to a}} quartic polynomial, and the sum of these is fed back into each mode. This has [...]...|$|E

50|$|The Scottish tenor drum is {{a musical}} {{instrument}} used within Scottish pipe bands. It is a double-headed membranophone that is held vertically with one head up, one head down, and played with <b>soft</b> <b>mallets</b> on the top head only. Common sizes of drums are 15, 16, 18, or 20 inch in diameter, with 12, 14, or 16 inch depth. The playing style of the Scottish tenor drum has varied throughout the years, but there is typically {{a variation of the}} combination of swings (or flourishes) and rhythmic accompaniment to the Scottish snare drum and the Great Highland Bagpipes. It is similar to the more common marching band style tenor drum.|$|R
50|$|In an orchestral setting, {{suspended}} cymbals {{are most}} often used for rolled crescendos, or swells. To do this, the player uses a single-stroke roll on the outside edge of the cymbal, using <b>soft</b> <b>mallets,</b> one on each side. The terminology most commonly used to describe this technique is a suspended cymbal roll. At times, a score also calls for hitting the cymbal with a stick or scraping it with a triangle beater. Other techniques utilize the bow of a string instrument, usually that of a contrabass, to be drawn slowly across the outside rim of the cymbal. This technique will give a very shrill, eerie sound, particularly useful in film music.|$|R
50|$|There {{are more}} {{choices for the}} {{performer}} than just the form. The performer can choose the tuning of the drums (since all drums can be tuned by tightening or loosening the heads), what sticks they use (there are many options of sticks, such as hard or <b>soft</b> <b>mallets,</b> or even different sizes of drum sticks), and which rhythms they play. Many of the different rhythms of the piece are almost impossible, so the performer must pick what notes they want to play, and which notes they have to skip over. These elements of indeterminacy all add {{to the idea that}} Xenakis revolutionized the solo percussion piece.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a symphony}} orchestra's {{percussion}} section, a tenor drum is a low-pitched drum, similar {{in size to}} a field snare, but without snares and played with <b>soft</b> <b>mallets</b> or hard sticks. It is larger in diameter than depth, and tonally is midway between the bass drum and unsnared side drum. Berlioz scored for 2 tenor drums in the [...] "Grande messe des morts". His [...] "Te Deum" [...] requires 6 tenor drums. Wagner wrote for this drum in [...] "Rienzi", [...] "Lohengrin", [...] "Die Walküre", and [...] "Parsifal". Struss used it in [...] "Ein Heldenleben", and Elgar in his 3rd. [...] "Pomp and Circumstance [...] " [...] march. It is noticeable in scores by 20th-century composers such as Stravinsky, Honegger, Milhaud,Benjamin Britten, William Walton, Aaron Copland and Samuel Barber.|$|R
5000|$|Marching tenor drums (also called quads, quints, tom-toms or multi-tenors) are {{single-headed}} tonal drums. Typically, {{they are}} referred to as tri-toms if there are three drums, quads if there are four, and so on for quints, and sextets. Modern tenor configurations usually have four to six drums, but there can be as few as one or as many as seven. Tenor players add pitch variety to the drumline with drums of different sizes. Tenor players use matched grip and generally play with mallets with plastic disc-shaped heads, though traditional drumsticks and <b>softer</b> <b>mallets</b> are commonly used to achieve different timbres. [...] Tenor drummers typically play in unison. Like the snare drum line, it is sometimes common for the lead tenor drum player to [...] "tap off", and set the tempo. Marching tenor drums can weigh anywhere between 30 and 60 pounds, depending on the model, and number of drums.|$|R
25|$|Part of {{what makes}} the flapamba’s {{characteristic}} sound is the tuning; for instance, the resonators are not tuned to the bars as in other standard keyboard percussion instruments. Renowned studio percussionist Emil Richards bought his original flapamba from Professional Drum Shop in Hollywood in the late 1960s or early 1970s, and added it to his giant instrument collection, the Emil Richards Collection. The staff at the store convinced him to buy it, as they told him that they were {{getting out of the}} percussion rental business since Emil was dominating much of the work in town. Emil couldn't find any info on the history or maker of the flapamba when he purchased it, but nevertheless he started using it on recording sessions, as the chromatic layout of the instrument made it an easy transition from other keyboard mallet instruments. He used the <b>softest</b> <b>mallets</b> possible or the meat of the fingers to get a warm, resonant, wooden sound. This original flapamba had a range from middle C (C4), up two full octaves.|$|R
5000|$|The ranat ek ( [...] , , [...] "alto xylophone") is a Thai musical {{instrument}} in the percussion family {{that consists of}} 21 wooden bars suspended by cords over a boat-shaped trough resonator and struck by two mallets. It {{is used as a}} leading instrument in the piphat ensemble.     Ranat ek bars are typically made from rosewood (Dalbergia oliveri; ไม้ชิงชัน; mai ching chan) and they are two types of ranat ek mallets. The hard mallets create the sharp and bright sound, normally used for faster playing. The <b>soft</b> <b>mallets</b> create the mellow and softer tone, used for slower songs.    In the Thai xylophone family, there are several similar instrument with bars made from different types of material, such as metal (ranat ek lek, ranat thum lek) and glass (ranat kaeo). There is another similar Thai xylophone that has a different kind of wooden bar, called “ranat thum”. Its appearance is similar to the ranat ek, but it is lower and wider. It is usually played in accompaniment of a ranat ek. Also, ranat ek is very similar to the Cambodian xylophone called “roneat ek”, and the Burmese bamboo xylophone called [...] "Pattalar".|$|R
50|$|A typical Whac-A-Mole machine {{consists}} of a large, waist-level cabinet with five holes in its top and a large, <b>soft,</b> black <b>mallet.</b> Each hole contains a single plastic mole and the machinery necessary to move it up and down. Once the game starts, the moles will begin to pop up from their holes at random. The object {{of the game is}} to force the individual moles back into their holes by hitting them directly on the head with the mallet, thereby adding to the player's score. The quicker this is done the higher the final score will be.|$|R
50|$|Bell plates can {{be played}} while {{suspended}} from a stand or while held in one hand of the performer depending {{of the number of}} different plates needed for a specific performance. If only one plate is needed, then the performer will simply hold that specific plate with one hand and strike it with the other. This plate can be kept on a table covered with a towel or carpet square while not being played. If the performance requires several plates to be played in succession, then the plates should be suspended from a stand. The player then strikes the plates with a wooden, hard plastic, or metal mallet which can be covered in varying thicknesses of felt to create a variety of sounds. A <b>softer</b> <b>mallet,</b> which has a thicker felt covering, can achieve a greater sounding of the fundamental pitch of the plate, while a harder mallet with a thinner covering of felt will produce stronger overtones and possibly overshadow the fundamental pitch of the plate. The sound can also be manipulated by striking different areas of the plate. Greater volume can be achieved by striking the center of the lower or upper third of the instrument, and a clearer pitch can be produced by striking the plate at the center or near the bottom edge. The Bell Plates may be dampened with the player's hand or with the mallet to quicken or immediately cut off the decay of the sound after striking.|$|R
