Sir Rudolf Bing, who remembered Callas as being [...] "monstrously fat" [...] in 1951, stated that after the weight loss, Callas was an [...] "astonishing, svelte, striking woman" [...] who [...] "showed none of the signs one usually finds in a fat woman who has lost weight: <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> though {{she had been born}} to that slender and graceful figure, and had always moved with that elegance." [...] Various rumors spread regarding her weight loss method; one had her swallowing a tapeworm, while Rome's Panatella Mills pasta company claimed she lost weight by eating their [...] "physiologic pasta", prompting Callas to file a lawsuit. Callas stated that she lost the weight by eating a sensible low-calorie diet of mainly salads and chicken.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} Soap Opera, Dorothy Hobson {{suggests}} that Raquel epitomised {{the representation of}} Northern working-class women during the 1990s: [...] "Raquel articulated the hopes of many young women in her position. The character was complex; one that the whole audience loved, she was naive, gentle, and although <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> if she would break men's hearts, {{for the most part}} it was her own heart that was broken." [...] Hobson deemed Raquel's breakdown at the registry office prior to her marriage to Curly [...] "one of the most poignant and heartbreaking of any scene in a soap opera, or indeed in any other dramas." [...] She felt that in sobbing with awareness that she was marrying not for love but security, Raquel [...] "spoke of the young working-class women, bright, intelligent, who had been failed by the education system, thus united the shared cultural knowledge of the audience as she wept for herself and millions of other women like her." ...|$|E

Bankhead, at 62 and audibly suffering from breathing difficulties from emphysema in the interview show, frankly spoke of how hopeless she would be on a desert island, admitting that she [...] "couldn’t put a key in the door, dahling. I can't do a thing for myself." [...] In the interview, host Plomley spoke of Bankhead's glory days as the most celebrated actress of 1920s London. Later he recalled of their interview, [...] "She was a very frail and ailing old lady, and I {{was shocked to see}} how old and ill <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> I helped her out of a taxi. She had come from her hotel wearing a mink coat slung over a pair of lounging pyjamas, and she leaned heavily on my arm as I supported her to the lift. Her eyes were still fine, and there was still beauty in the bone structure of her face beneath the wrinkles and ravages of hard living. Her hands shook, and when she wished to go to the loo she had to ask Monica Chapman to accompany her to help her with her clothing." ...|$|E
