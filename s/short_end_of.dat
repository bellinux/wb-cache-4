50|$|Counterweight trebuchets are {{powered by}} gravity; {{potential}} energy is stored by slowly raising an extremely heavy weight box (typically filled with stones, sand, or lead) attached by a hinged {{connection to the}} <b>shorter</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the beam, and releasing it on command. Traction trebuchets are human powered; on command, men pull ropes attached to the <b>shorter</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the trebuchet beam.

25|$|Boyle's Law {{was perhaps}} the first {{expression}} of an equation of state. In 1662 Robert Boyle performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. Mercury {{was added to the}} tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was carefully measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the tube and that in the long, open end. The image of Boyle's Equipment shows some of the exotic tools used by Boyle during his study of gases.|$|E
25|$|Adult seals {{more than}} one year old must be shot in the head with {{expanding}} bullets, and cannot be clubbed to death. The hakapik shall be used to ensure the animal is dead. This is done by crushing the skull of the shot adult seal with the <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the hakapik, before the long spike is thrust deep into the animal's brain. The seal is then bled by making an incision from its jaw to the end of its sternum. The killing and bleeding must be done on the ice, and live animals may never be brought on board the ship. Young seals may be killed using just the hakapik, but only in the aforementioned manner, i.e., they need not be shot.|$|E

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis {{had a significant}} effect on the interest rates and the term structure of interest rates around the globe. In this paper we apply the GARCH-in-mean (GARCH-M) to study the effect of the {{global financial}} crisis on the term structure volatility, persistence of volatility, risk premium, and effects of the yield spread in five European markets; Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain (PIIGS). To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first such study in the field, and thus represents the main contribution of the paper to the literature. We investigate both the longer <b>end</b> and the <b>shorter</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the term structure. We study two versions <b>of</b> the longer <b>end</b> based on the 10 -year bond (long-term rate) and the two short-term rates, (three- and six-month rates). The <b>shorter</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the term structure is based on the two short-term rates. Results indicate a substantial change in the term structure volatility, persistence of volatility, risk premium, and the effects of the yield spread due to the financial crisis.

25|$|The early Pacers {{came out}} on the <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> two of the most one-sided trades in NBA history. In 1980, they traded Alex English to the Nuggets in order to reacquire former ABA star George McGinnis. McGinnis was long past his prime, and contributed very little during his two-year return. English, in contrast, went on {{to become one of the}} {{greatest}} scorers in NBA history. The next year, they traded a 1984 draft pick to the Portland Trail Blazers for center Tom Owens, who played one year for the Pacers with little impact. In 1983–84, the Pacers finished with the worst record in the Eastern Conference, which would have given the Pacers the second overall pick in the draft—the pick that the Blazers used to select Sam Bowie while Michael Jordan was still available. As a result of the Owens trade, they were left as bystanders in the midst of one of the deepest drafts in NBA history—including such future stars as Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton.|$|E

500|$|Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve vied for {{the title}} in [...] Villeneuve, driving the {{superior}} Williams FW19, led the championship {{in the early part}} of the season. However, by mid-season, Schumacher had taken the championship lead, winning five races, and entered the season's final Grand Prix with a one-point advantage. Towards the end of the race, held at Jerez, Schumacher's Ferrari developed a coolant leak and loss of performance indicating he may not finish the race. As Villeneuve approached to pass his rival, Schumacher attempted to provoke an accident, but got the <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the stick, retiring from the race. Villeneuve went on and scored four points to take the championship. Schumacher was punished for unsportsmanlike conduct for the collision and was disqualified from the Drivers' Championship.|$|E

500|$|At some point, however, {{disagreements}} over funding evidently arose between the McDonald brothers and Hogan. On February 18, 1907, the Zanesville Signal reported that Hogan had received permission from [...] "the Messrs.

The following day, Hogan was quoted as saying, [...] "Youngstown couldn't or didn't raise enough money to cover a sparrow's blanket". The ball club manager's evident frustration during this period was reflected in comments published in The Youngstown Daily Vindicator almost a week after the team's sale. When questioned on his widely publicized decision to resign as manager of the Youngstown club before the opening of the 1907 season, Hogan reportedly said that he had received [...] "the <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the deal". No reference was made to the club's sale.|$|E
500|$|Several reviews {{criticized the}} changes made to Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock {{compared}} to previous {{games in the}} Guitar Hero series. IGN's review of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions considered the game a [...] "pretty safe effort" [...] from Neversoft, doing little to change the game due to it being their first time working on the series. [...] They also criticized the lack of customizable characters. IGN's review of the Wii version described the game's presentation and art direction as feeling [...] "forced", and, as a result, less visually appealing than previous installments. GameDaily questioned the [...] "white boy soundtrack" [...] and {{would have liked to}} have seen more tracks from legends like Jimi Hendrix and Prince in the mix." [...] GameSpy criticized some of the difficulty tweaks in the game. They stated that [...] "Medium simply feels like Hard-minus-the-orange-button," [...] and that the Star Power phrases were too long, comparing the overall game to a [...] "trial by fire" [...] in contrast to the previous games in the series. They were also critical of the dongle approach used for the PlayStation 3 controllers, and failings in the online support for the PlayStation 3 version. GameSpot criticized the game for its [...] "heavy dose of in-game advertising." [...] GameSpy stated that the PlayStation 2 version received [...] "the <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the stick" [...] because of a lack of online play. Official Xbox Magazine also criticized the game for being [...] "too competitive", a facet not readily found in the previous games. The PC version has been criticized for its high system requirements, and for lag and slowdown problems even on high-end systems.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{performed}} about 80 shots per exhibition. He {{had a large}} {{repertoire of}} practiced shots—more than 500—affording him the luxury to not having to repeat a single shot during a week-long exhibition. The abundance of shots was unusual, and was described by one sports writer as [...] "more extensive than the entire billiard fraternity put together". The following description of Adams' shots appeared in an 1891 newspaper article, which highlighted them as, [...] "among his difficult feats":Two quart wine bottles are placed at the <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the table, three feet apart; a ball {{is placed on the}} top of each bottle, and a third ball, six feet from the bottles in the opposite corner. Adams makes the hand ball jump from bottle to bottle then to take an English in space, counting on the third bail, a double shot.Fifteen balls are placed in a line, three inches apart. On the last ball is placed a piece of chalk, while two feet from the other end, at a square angle, is placed a single ball. Yank drops the hand ball with a Massé twist, which, after hitting the single ball, describes a semi-circle, taken the cushion first, then makes a carrom on the fifteen balls, but is played with such a delicate calculation as barely to reach the last ball; in fact, freezes against it so gently as not to dislodge the chalk previously placed thereon.A derby hat is placed on the table, under which is a ball. One foot from the hat are two balls a foot apart, which he carroms on, the hand ball continues striking the rim of the hat, forces it up, and goes under making the stroke on the third ball, then returns from under the hat when it rocks the second time.He also stand {{at the head of the}} table, throwing the balls with a hundred-yard force but has them stop eight feet away in such a position as to spell his name.|$|E
