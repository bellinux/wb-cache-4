40|$|Relationships between {{exposure}} to noise [metric: day-evening-night levels (DENL) ] from stationary sources (shunting yards, a <b>seasonal</b> <b>industry,</b> and other industries) and annoyance are presented. Curves are presented for expected annoyance score, the percentage "highly annoyed" (%HA, cutoff at 72 {{on a scale from}} 0 to 100), the percentage "annoyed" (%A, cutoff at 50 on a scale from 0 to 100), and the percentage "(at least) a little annoyed" (%LA, cutoff at 28 on a scale from 0 to 100). The estimates of the parameters of the relations are based on the data from a field study (N= 1875) at 11 locations (2 shunting yards, 1 <b>seasonal</b> <b>industry,</b> 8 other industries) in the Netherlands. With the same (yearly) DENL, the <b>seasonal</b> <b>industry</b> causes less annoyance than the other industries, while the other industries cause less annoyance than the shunting yards. It appears that annoyance caused by vibrations from shunting yards and annoyance caused by noise from through trains are (partly) responsible for the relatively high annoyance from shunting yards. The relatively low annoyance from the <b>seasonal</b> <b>industry</b> presumably is related to the presence of a relatively quiet period. Results for the two shunting yards and the <b>seasonal</b> <b>industry</b> are based on fewer data than the other industrial sources, and are indicative. The same patterns of influence of age and noise sensitivity that are generally found are also found in this study.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityMuch of the {{literature}} dealing with employment in seasonal industries with sharp peaks or short active seasons states or implies that all such industries employ, mostly, temporar. y entrants to the labor force during their active seasons who withdraw when that season is over. 	This {{seems to be an}} e~ension of the observation of the practice in summer resort and other industries with a short summer peak to all (resort and other) industries with short active seasons. 	It is questionable whether this is actually true for seasonal winter resort industries, particularly in non-urban areas. 	This study proposes to examine the labor supplies of a winter <b>seasonal</b> <b>industry</b> with a test of that assumption in view. It is proposed, also, that the concepts of primary and secondary members of the labor force, introduced by Wilcock, be utilized in the study. Such concepts which differentiate between workers who belong regularly to the labor force and those who enter and leave at various intervals should prove useful when dealing with seasonal employment and seasonal workers [TRUNCATED...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Canning {{workers were}} {{organised}} into the Food and Canning workers Union {{in large numbers}} when the union grew along {{with the growth of}} the South African canning industry, stimulated by the demand for canned goods during World War II. Formed in 1941, by Ray Alexander, a member of the Communist Party, the union spread into the small canning towns to become established with a base in the fruit canning districts of the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and in the West coast fish canning industry. As a consequence of developing within a geographically dispersed and <b>seasonal</b> <b>industry,</b> the union assumed a particular organisational form, promoting the autonomy of branches and seasonal fluctuations in union strength. The Food and Canning Workers Union was a non-racial and militant union that brought tremendous improvements in wages, working and living conditions to the workers who joined its ranks and participated in the struggles it led. The union also {{played a major role in}} the affairs of the labour movement and participated in political campaigns that occurred in the 1940 s and 1950 s. Through a relationship to the Communist Party in the 1940 s, to the South African Congress of Trade Unions during the mid- 1950 s to early 1960 s, the Food and Canning Workers Union reveals an approach to politics that gave priority to the economic position of its members and also sought to contribute to broader political campaigns. This dissertation provides a critical history of the union from its inception in 1941 to 1975.

40|$|The New Zealand (NZ) pipfruit {{industry}} has recently set an ambitious target {{of more than}} doubling its export by 2022. However the {{industry has}} not performed {{very well in the}} past ten years with many growers averaging substantial losses. One key government action has been to deploy Lean thinking to improve production performance. The New Zealand pipfruit industry has not taken up this opportunity for unknown reasons. One reason may be that it is not known if the Lean paradigm will suit this <b>seasonal</b> <b>industry</b> which has a large manual labour component but pushes product into market, contrary to Lean principles. Although Lean has been successfully implemented in a number of industries, there is little information about implementation in a horticultural context. Lean was not designed for pipfruit. The aim {{of this study is to}} research the concept of Lean and its theoretical ‘fit’ and practical applicability in a horticultural setting, specifically the New Zealand pipfruit industry. A complex of methodologies integrates to find the answer. The literature review discusses transferability of common theoretical Lean themes to other industries. Consultants are interviewed to assess their views on the suitability of Lean for the pipfruit industry, while an industry-wide survey determines the current state of knowledge and Lean deployment within the industry, using a unique ‘single-question-per-day’ approach. Several case studies and action research studies then obtain rich data from organisations that have started with Lean implementation in recent times. The inquiry demonstrates that Lean has many transferable elements and that the industry as a whole is not currently considered Lean. Data from action research and case studies demonstrate that Lean is largely applicable—leading to a measurable increase of Lean—supported by some positive financial indicators. The inquiry culminates in the development of a model and framework that can be applied in the future. In addition, orchards delivered some original interpretations of waste and developed a Lean assessment tool. The inquiry edified that Lean substantially fits the different elements of the NZ pipfruit industry. This paper contributes to fill the gap in knowledge about Lean in a horticultural environment...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} extent to which {{unemployment}} insurance (UI) insures workers against unforeseen events or subsidizes firms and workers engaged in temporary layoffs. Our main source of data is a 5 - year panel of UI administrative records from five states. While most claimants receive UI only once during this period, nearly forty percent of claims go to those individuals with three or more years of receipt during the 5 -year period. Most repeat recipients are concentrated in <b>seasonal</b> <b>industries</b> and are laid off by the same employer each time.

50|$|In the U.S., the {{unemployment}} insurance allowance one receives is {{based solely on}} previous income (not time worked, family size, etc.) and usually compensates for one-third of one's previous income.

Although 90% of citizens are covered by unemployment insurance, less than 40% apply for and receive benefits. However, the number applying for and receiving benefits increases during recessions. In cases of highly <b>seasonal</b> <b>industries</b> the system provides income to workers during the off seasons, thus encouraging them to stay attached to the industry.|$|R
40|$|The bullwhip {{effect is}} the {{phenomenon}} of increasing demand variability in the supply chain from downstream echelons (retail) to upstream echelons (manufacturing). The objective {{of this study is}} to document the strength of the bullwhip effect in industry-level U. S. data. In particular, we say an industry exhibits the bullwhip effect if the variance of the inflow of material to the industry (what macroeconomists often refer to as the variance of an industry 2 ̆ 7 s “production”) is greater than the variance of the industry 2 ̆ 7 s sales. We find that wholesale industries exhibit a bullwhip effect, but retail industries generally do not exhibit the effect, nor do most manufacturing industries. Furthermore, we observe that manufacturing industries do not have substantially greater demand volatility than retail industries. Based on theoretical explanations for observing or not observing demand amplification, we are able to explain a substantial portion of the heterogeneity in the degree to which industries exhibit the bullwhip effect. In particular, the less <b>seasonal</b> an <b>industry</b> 2 ̆ 7 s demand, the more likely the <b>industry</b> amplifies volatility—highly <b>seasonal</b> <b>industries</b> tend to smooth demand volatility whereas nonseasonal industries tend to amplify...|$|R
