50|$|The {{threatened}} Nubian ibex, <b>Syrian</b> <b>serin,</b> caracal, {{and lesser}} kestrel are natives of Wadi Dana {{and plans to}} save the species were put forth by Global Environment Fund in 1994. Additionally, the largest breeding colony of the <b>Syrian</b> <b>serin</b> is in Dana Nature Reserve. Threats to the animals include hunting.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Syrian</b> <b>serin</b> is {{a brightly}} {{coloured}} small passerine {{bird in the}} finch family Fringillidae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Syrian</b> <b>serin</b> is prettily {{coloured}} {{with bright}} yellow and pale grey feathers. The eyes {{are large and}} are surrounded by a bright yellow ring. The beak is grey and the legs are pale pinkish-grey. It has a long trilling call, and may also chirp and twitter.|$|E
50|$|Species which {{triggered}} the IBA designation include griffon vultures which occur in small numbers, sombre tits, Upcher's warblers, Menetries's warblers, western rock-nuthatches, white-throated robins, Finsch's wheatears, pale rock sparrows and <b>Syrian</b> <b>serins.</b> In winter the reservoir provides habitat for waders and sometimes ducks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Syrian</b> <b>serins</b> {{breed in}} Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan, at altitudes of between 900 and 1,900 metres. The {{population}} in Jordan makes local movements in winter, but {{the birds of}} Lebanon, Israel and Syria migrate to wintering grounds in Egypt, Turkey and Iraq. They inhabit rocky areas with oak and conifer shrubs or trees and frequent grasslands and fields feeding mainly on the seeds of annuals and grasses. In Southwestern Jordan, its main diet during winter is the seeds of Artemisia.|$|R
5000|$|The Aammiq Wetland is a Biosphere {{reserve in}} the Beqaa Valley {{and is the}} largest wetland area in the country, {{covering}} an area of [...] of marshes and lakes. It is an important site for migratory birds and over 250 species of bird have been recorded there including such rarities as the ferruginous duck, the great snipe, the lesser kestrel and the greater spotted eagle. In the nearby Shouf Mountains, there are such species as the endemic <b>Syrian</b> <b>serin,</b> the horned owl, the chukar partridge and the long-legged buzzard.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 426 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in Jordan. Many of these are rare or accidental arrivals, and others are migratory birds in passage between their breeding grounds and their wintering quarters. Others overwinter in Jordan and still others breed in the country. Some of them are globally threatened, and these include the white-headed duck, Atlantic petrel, northern bald ibis, Egyptian vulture, Griffon vulture, lappet-faced vulture, Pharaoh eagle-owl, barn owl, golden eagle, steppe eagle, greater spotted eagle, eastern imperial eagle, MacQueen's bustard, Siberian crane, sociable lapwing, saker falcon, marbled duck, aquatic warbler and <b>Syrian</b> <b>serin.</b> Four large raptors, the short-toed snake eagle, long-legged buzzard, Barbary falcon and Bonelli's eagle, {{are found in the}} Mujib Biosphere Reserve, and the globally threatened lesser kestrel breeds there. Other bird species prevalent in Jordan include the hooded crow, Eurasian jay, hoopoe, common cuckoo, Tristram's starling, house crow and white-spectacled bulbul.|$|E
50|$|The swamp lies {{on one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bird migration routes in the world, and over 250 species of birds have been recorded in the area, including the globally vulnerable greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), and lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni). Records of globally near-threatened bird species at the wetland include great snipe (Gallinago media), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca) and pallid harrier (Circus macrourus). In addition to the great diversity of birds in the area, there are a wide variety of animals living in and around the marsh. Twenty-three species of mammals have been recorded, including jungle cat (Felis chaus) and European otter (Lutra lutra). Five species of amphibians and twelve species of reptiles have been recorded, and a two-year weekly butterfly survey found fifty-three species of butterflies in the area. The wetland lies 7 km SSW of the city of Qab Elias on the eastern edge of Mount Lebanon. The main area of reedbeds and open pools covers 253 ha, stretching east from the foot of the mountains to the Litani River in a long strip. Rain and snow falling on the high ridge of Barouk mountain to the west provide water for the wetland. Most rain falls between December and March, soaking quickly through layers of limestone in the mountains and emerging as springs in the valley floor. The water is particularly pure, as it has not been polluted by agricultural fertilizers, pesticides, etc. In recent years the marsh dried out by mid-July (with the exception of a few deep pools and ditches) and did not fill up again until January or February. However, the introduction by A Rocha's involvement of improved management techniques, such as the reduced pumping of water for irrigation of nearby farmland, and changes to less “thirsty” crops, has helped the marsh remain wet throughout the year. This has resulted in a significant increase in wintering and breeding water birds since 2002. Surrounding the open water and reed bed are areas of rough grazing, cultivated land, drainage ditches, and an avenue of trees, all adding to the diversity of habitats in the area. On the nearby mountain slopes, small wooded areas and rocky shrubland give an even greater variety of habitats and species. Behind the nearby village of Aammiq are woods where Syrian woodpecker (Dendrocopus syriacus) and <b>Syrian</b> <b>serin</b> (Serinus syriacus) can be found. In spring and summer, shrubby hillsides are home to assorted buntings, wheatears, warblers and shrikes, and rocky gorges host western rock nuthatch (Sitta neumayer) and Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo). Mammals present include Caucasian squirrel, wildcat, wild boar and the elusive Indian porcupine..The Aammiq Wetland and some of the surrounding area is in the process of being declared a National Reserve. The main landowning family is fully engaged in the preservation of this very important ecosystem and initial plans to develop the area for ecotourism are underway.|$|E
