5|$|That night I {{asked the}} Mother of God {{what was to}} become of me. Then she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity, and the red that I should become a martyr. I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would accept them both.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} at Saint Hilda's Primary School, Presbyterian High School and other {{locations}} during the school holidays in June. Neo hired real gangsters to act in several gangster scenes as he was dissatisfied with the extras. According to him, communicating with the gangsters was difficult, but {{when he decided to}} apply the lessons from the movie and praised them for a good take, they reacted well. Several members of the cast also <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> Not Stupid Too inspired them to communicate better with their family members. On 26 January 2006, distributor United International Pictures released I Not Stupid Too on 36 screens in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be studying with him. He said something to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E

25|$|Out in {{the real}} world, however, the {{response}} has been overwhelmingly positive. I've signed books in five stores, with more than 1,000 buyers at each site. I've had one negative remark—that I should be tried for treason—and one caller on C-SPAN <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was an anti-Semite. My most troubling experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on university campuses with high Jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors. I have been most encouraged by prominent Jewish citizens and members of Congress who have thanked me privately for presenting the facts and some new ideas.|$|E
500|$|After the Dream Within a Dream Tour {{in support}} of Britney {{finalized}} in July 2002, Spears announced she would {{take a break from}} her career for six months.

500|$|What happened? I {{signed a}} shitty deal, but luckily it was non-exclusive. I {{got tired of}} doing Strapping so I said, 'I can't do it anymore.' Then I freaked out and went into a hospital. My lawyer <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was under mental duress when I signed the {{contract}} so the contract is void. At that point it was like, 'I just won't do another Strapping record.' Yeah, I went down saying 'CM was the shittiest label ever.' And they went down as saying that I was 'a complete, arrogant psychopath.' ...|$|E

500|$|... "My Moment" [...] is a self-empowerment {{song that}} lasts {{for three minutes}} and twenty-five seconds. It is {{composed}} in the key of E major, simply using three major chords (E, B, and A, respectively). According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, the song [...] "is addressing all those haters who didn't necessarily get her last viral smash, [...] "Friday". Black starts singing the lyrics [...] "Weren't you the one who <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be nothing?/ Well, I'm about to prove you wrong/ I'm {{not the only one}} who believes in something/ My one wish is about to come true." [...] As the song goes, Black addresses her negative reception even more, singing, [...] "Haters, said I'll see you later/Can't talk to you right now/I'm getting my paper". [...] "My Moment" [...] features a simple mid-tempo melody with a prominent uses of garish keyboards on its background. Uses of pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune on Black's vocals were also noticed.|$|E
500|$|On 30 August 2013, Tasci {{moved to}} Russian Premier League side Spartak Moscow for an {{undisclosed}} fee. Upon leaving Stuttgart, he told the press, [...] "It {{was not an easy}} decision. The present decision is not a decision against VfB, but for the new task. I had an incredibly great time at VfB, have played in the youth here, then I turned pro and recently been the captain. I have always <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a VfBler and that I will remain." [...] Immediately after joining the club, his debut was delayed by the injuries he sustained while at Stuttgart and he did not play for three weeks. He made his first appearance with the club on 2 October 2013 when he appeared in training. After damaging his meniscus, Tasci announced he would return in January following an operation. He made his debut for the club on 17 March 2014 in a 2–2 draw against Anzhi Makhachkala. He made three more appearances that season.|$|E
500|$|The first {{actor to}} be cast was Renee O'Connor as Dr. Jessica Ryan in December 2006; she filmed her first scenes in February 2007. O'Connor had visited her {{personal}} friend and Boogeymans producer Rob Tapert on the New Zealand set, {{where she had}} had a discussion with him about [...] "the differences of having a supernatural demon versus a real person that can come in and be a threat." [...] She concluded the former was scarier. On getting cast in the film and her approach to the character, she stated:I had a contract with Rob Tapert and I just emailed him and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really wanted to play this character. I think she would be interesting because it touches back on some of the things I've played as an actress, and that was it. [...] It was so tight in the dialogue, you just have to play with the relationships and find other things going on with the characters to make it seem like there's more depth to what's going on, that there's more of a history between them.|$|E

500|$|Soon after Tamarod's first statement, the Haq Movement for Liberty and Democracy {{announced}} {{its support for}} protest plans. [...] "Let August 14 be the day of rebellion against the ruling gang in Bahrain," [...] the movement said in a statement. The February 14 Youth Coalition also supported the protests and called for civil disobedience for 3 days. The youth group also told participants to avoid clashing with police. Ali Salman, leader of Al Wefaq opposition society welcomed the Tamarod plans. [...] "We support any peaceful movement, {{at any time and}} from any party. Everybody has the right to protest ... the call for protests on August 14 shows that the Bahraini people will not cease to demonstrate until they achieve their demands," [...] he added. Al Wefaq however, stopped short of taking part in the Tamarod movement, blaming their secession on clashes between security forces and protesters. [...] "t {{is going to be a}} peaceful movement but having <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> also expect clashes ... I only pray that there are no victims," [...] said Ali Salman.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr is {{credited}} with inventing the Beatles' moptop haircut although she disagrees, saying: [...] "All that rubbish people <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> created their hairstyle, that's rubbish! Lots of German boys had that hairstyle. Stuart [...] had {{it for a long}} while and the others copied it. I suppose the most important thing I contributed to them was friendship." [...] In 1995, Kirchherr told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles haircut. And my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [...] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work." [...] Kirchherr says that after she cut Sutcliffe's hair, Harrison asked her to do the same when she was visiting Liverpool, and Lennon and McCartney had their hair cut in the same style while they were in Paris, by Kirchherr's friend, Vollmer, who was living there at the time as an assistant to photographer William Klein.|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{the final}} episode for actor Iwan Rheon, who had played Ramsay Bolton since Game of Thrones third season. His first {{appearance}} was in [...] "Dark Wings, Dark Words", as a then-unnamed [...] "boy" [...] who helps a captured Theon Greyjoy. Before he was cast as Ramsay, Rheon auditioned {{for the role of}} Jon Snow. In an interview, he described learning about his character's fate: [...] "I had received half the scripts, five episodes, then I got the call. They joked, 'Isn't it great Ramsay ends up on the Iron Throne?' As soon as they <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> said, 'He's dead, isn't he?' It's cool. I've had four lovely seasons here. It's been great to be involved with such an amazing show. I think it's kind of right he goes down. Because what else {{is he going to do}} after this? He's done so many things. It's justified and it's the right thing to do. It's the right path. He's reached his peak. It's nice for the audience that he goes out on this high, if you will." [...] In that interview, Kit Harington talked about Rheon: [...] "I love Iwan's work. He's an incredibly detailed actor who's created a character who's remarkable and despicable." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the book}} was written, Tripathi felt {{that it would be}} {{difficult}} for him to get a big publication house to publish his novel. The manuscript for The Immortals of Meluha got rejected by 35 to 40 publication houses. Hence, he decided to apply his management skills and promote his book. The Immortals of Meluha—originally titled Shiva: The Man, The Legend—was finally released by Tripathi’s literary agent Anuj Bahri, the owner of the landmark BahriSons Booksellers in Khan Market, New Delhi. Tripathi explained with Daily News and Analysis, [...] "I would be lying if I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was sure I would get a big publisher for my first novel. I was a finance guy and a staunch believer in digital marketing that has a better reach in the books market. It actually puts up a conversation rather than a two-minute wire on the same." [...] Together with his friends, Tripathi launched his promotion of the book on the internet. He put up the entire first chapter of The Immortals of Meluha as a digital download from his website, so that the readers would get interested. With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi, he launched a live-action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter, surrounding the video, to further hold the reader's interest.|$|E
