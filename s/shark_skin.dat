500|$|The {{earliest}} {{records of}} A'a date to 1821, when the statue {{was presented to}} the missionaries of the LMS on Ra'iatea, the second largest of the Society Islands in French Polynesia. [...] It had been brought there from Rurutu, where it was made. [...] The sculpture itself could be much older: radiocarbon dating carried out in 2015 suggests that A'a was created between 1591 and 1647. [...] According to Rurutuan tradition, A'a is made from the wood of the pua keni keni (Fagraea berteriana) that is native to islands in the eastern Pacific, though tests conducted in 2015 suggested that the figure is in fact made from sandalwood, possibly Santalum insulare. [...] A'a was probably made using stone-bladed tools, though if it was made after the arrival of Europeans to Polynesia in the 1760s iron tools may also have been used in its construction. [...] Ray or <b>shark</b> <b>skin</b> rasps, breadfruit leaves, cowrie shells and coconut oil would have been used to finish and polish the statue.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile a Japanese colony was {{established}} in Ayutthaya. The colony was active in trade, particularly in the export of deer-hide and sappan wood to Japan in exchange for Japanese silver and Japanese handicrafts (swords, lacquered boxes, high-quality papers).

40|$|Research at Langley on skin {{friction}} drag was described in Tech Briefs. 3 M engineers suggested to Langley that grooves molded into a lightweight plastic film with adhesive backing and pressed on an airplane would be simpler than cutting grooves directly onto the surface.

50|$|Further testing using salt bridge {{electrochemical}} {{cells were}} conducted during 2006 and 2007 at the Oak Ridge Shark Lab.

50|$|Florida {{became a}} state in 1845, but the keys weren’t officially {{incorporated}} until 1870 after they were surveyed by Charles F. Smith. According to locals the key was named after an old settler circa 1855, other documents state the key as being named “Ellis Island before 1855.” The early pioneers suffered from clouds of mosquitos and no-see-ums. They lived in thatched roofed houses that were regularly mowed down by hurricanes, and were cut off from civilization because the island was only navigable by boat. After the FEC built the railroad in 1908, and it brought some prosperity to the area.

5|$|The blacktip shark is an {{extremely}} fast, energetic predator that is usually found in groups of varying size. Segregation by sex and age does not occur; adult males and nonpregnant females are found apart from pregnant females, and both are separated from juveniles. In Terra Ceia Bay, Florida, a nursery area for this species, juvenile blacktips form aggregations {{during the day and}} disperse at night. They aggregate most strongly in the early summer when the sharks are youngest, suggesting that they are seeking refuge from predators (mostly larger sharks) in numbers. Predator avoidance may also be the reason why juvenile blacktips do not congregate in the areas of highest prey density in the bay. Adults have no known predators. Known parasites of the blacktip shark include the copepods Pandarus sinuatus and P. smithii, and the monogeneans Dermophthirius penneri and Dionchus spp., which attach the <b>shark's</b> <b>skin.</b> This species is also parasitized by nematodes in the family Philometridae, which infest the ovaries.|$|R
60|$|The water-woman said nothing, but {{stood on}} the rock, gazing sadly after the Prince, as the {{dolphins}} drew him rapidly from the shore.

He shifted his position so often, and rolled the vehicle about so much, that once or twice the sea-boy turned round and asked him if he did not wish to get out, to which the Prince did not reply, but only urged him to make greater speed. The journey lasted until the morning of the next day, and was marked by no greater occurrence than the annoyance caused by the wild dolphins occasionally coming up around them, endeavoring to play with their brothers in harness.

5000|$|Shark skin: {{the surface}} of <b>shark</b> <b>skin</b> is covered with tiny 'teeth' or dermal denticles. The shape and {{positioning}} of these denticles varies across the shark's body, altering {{the flow of water}} in a way to minimize form drag.|$|E

30|$|Another {{non-toxic}} antifouling approach {{involves the}} development of foul-resistant topographies [14 – 17]. Some of these topography designs were inspired by naturally occurring marine topographies from organisms {{that are able to}} prevent fouling on themselves despite spending most of their lives underwater. Examples of these natural topographies include the micro sized riblets on <b>shark’s</b> <b>skin</b> and the ridge-pore covered skin of pilot whales [18, 19]. Artificially derived geometries of varying scales (from macro to nano) such as meshes, pillars, grooves, bumps and holes were also investigated to determine their effect on the settlement behaviour of marine organisms [20 – 22]. Studies have shown that micro topography has antifouling properties but topography of this scale alone only reduced the settlement of a few marine species at a time [23, 24]. Several studies have mentioned that the mixed scale on hierarchical structures might be able to discourage a wider range of fouling organisms from settling concurrently [23, 25, 26]. Since not much is known about this topography configuration, future studies are necessary to determine if it would be more effective than current foul-resistant topographies.|$|R
50|$|Drums called pasu or pabu {{were present}} in 1841 {{at the time of}} the United States Exploring Expedition, but are no longer used or even remembered. Considered unusual for Western Polynesia, the {{instrument}} was cylindrical in frame, upright in its playing position, crafted of <b>shark's</b> <b>skin,</b> and beaten with two sticks. Slit-gongs, known as lala or lali, were also described in 1841. They were created from a hollow log and struck with a heavy beater. A smaller version of slit gongs was known as kaulalo. Another smaller slit drum, the pate, was used with handclapping or pati (slapping) during taualuga dancing. Weaving boards (papa or papafailalaga) are struck with thin sticks and produce a brittle sound. Beaten with sticks, moega (rolled mats) are used as accompaniment during mauluulu dancing. Plywood is used for crafting the pokihi, a mat-covered box; it accompanies the fatele dance.
