5|$|Born in Lottah, Tasmania, on 17September 1903, Alan Charlesworth {{was the son}} of a <b>storeman,</b> Edwin Charlesworth, and {{his wife}} Louisa. The youth {{attended}} Lottah Public School and St Virgil's College, Hobart, before entering the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1920. He won the Silver Boomerang trophy, awarded to the college's champion athlete, three years running in 1921–23. In 1923 he was appointed company sergeant major at Duntroon, and received the Sword of Honour upon graduating as a lieutenant later that year. Following service as adjutant and quartermaster with the 2nd Light Horse Regiment in Queensland, Charlesworth transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a flying officer on 27January 1925. Among his classmates on the 1925 pilots' course at Point Cook, Victoria, was fellow Duntroon graduate Frederick Scherger. During a training flight on 25March, Charlesworth's Avro 504K stalled and spun into a field, injuring him and killing his instructor. Recovering, he was subsequently involved in an accident with future lieutenant general and Governor of New South Wales Eric Woodward, when their plane flipped on landing and came to rest upside down on a fence; neither man was badly hurt.|$|E
25|$|Currey was {{discharged}} from the AIF in 1919, and took up employment as a <b>storeman,</b> working for the Railways Department in New South Wales, remaining in the role until 1941. On 10 April 1920, he married Emmie Davies St Saviour's Anglican Church, in Punchbowl, and the couple later had two daughters together. Currey briefly returned to the military twice: in 1930–32 {{he served in the}} Militia in the 45th Battalion, and then during the Second World War he served in the Australian Instructional Corps as a sergeant in a training role between 1940 and 1941 before being discharged.|$|E

Six of the dead soldiers were from his company, including his clerk and <b>storeman.</b> He received a personal commendation from the General commanding in Northern Ireland for his actions on the day.|$|E
500|$|Depots were {{established}} inland {{rather than in}} the vicinity of the port because the Japanese threatened a landing on the coast. A [...] speed limit was imposed to minimise damage to the main road. This was covered with [...] of dust that turned to mud when it rained. The surface soon broke up under heavy military traffic. The road was only wide enough to allow for one-way traffic and had a number of hairpin bends that required 3-ton trucks to make three-point turns. The 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot was established at 17 Mile in prefabricated huts, erected by Papuan labour, while the 8th Advanced Ammunition Depot handled the ammunition depots at 12 Mile and 19 Mile. In the crisis days of early 1942 some [...] of ammunition was dumped where it was unloaded off the trucks and covered with tarpaulins, with only one <b>storeman</b> on hand to receive it. Soon, no one knew what lay under the tarpaulins. This was hard to rectify as there was an acute shortage of ordnance personnel due to the low priority accorded to service units. The 19 Mile site was poor and a new depot was developed on a better site at 12 Mile.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992 the Packing Room Prize was established, {{in which}} the staff who receive the portraits and install them in the gallery vote for their choice of winner.

The Packing Room Prize is awarded {{annually}} and since June 2014, the prize has been A$1,500.|$|E
2500|$|Ivor Cutler {{was born}} in Govan, Glasgow into a middle-class Jewish family of Eastern European descent. His father Jack Moris Cutler was a {{wholesale}} jeweller and had premises at 85 Queen Street, Glasgow. He cited his childhood {{as the source of}} his artistic temperament, recalling a sense of displacement when his younger brother was born: [...] "Without that I would not have been so screwed up as I am, and therefore not as creative." [...] In 1939 Cutler was evacuated to Annan. He joined the Royal Air Force as a navigator in 1942 but was soon grounded for [...] "dreaminess" [...] and worked as a <b>storeman.</b> He moved to London where he was employed by the Inner London Education Authority to teach music, dance, drama and poetry to 7- to 11-year-olds. Cutler's deeply held views on humanity meant he disliked corporal punishment and on leaving a teaching job he held in the 1950s he cut up his tawse and handed the pieces to the class.|$|E
