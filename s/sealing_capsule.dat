40|$|Two phases {{have been}} completed, {{of a program}} whose {{ultimate}} objective {{is the development of}} an alkali metal resistant, thermal shock resistant, leak-tight, and neutron radiation resistant ceramic-to-metal seal capable of operation at 1200 C for three to five years. The first phase involved the screening of platinum-base, vanadium-base and vanadium-niobium base brazes for the joining of Cb- 1 Zr or T- 111 alloys to high purity alumina. The second phase involved studies of the performance of <b>sealed</b> <b>capsule</b> samples during 5000 -hour aging tests at 800, 1000, and 1200 C in high vacuum. <b>Sealed</b> <b>capsules</b> which were made using pure vanadium braze, and were brazed at 1850 C for one minute, survived 64 thermal cycles to 1200 C at the heating/cooling rate of 100 C/minute. Vanadium braze samples survived 5000 -hour aging tests at 800, 1000, and 1200 C. One thermally cycled sample survived a subsequent 5000 -hour aging period at 1000 C, but another, at 1200 C, did not survive. It was concluded that a pure vanadium braze used to bond high purity alumina to Cb- 1 Zr alloy is the best of the systems studied, but that additional studies must be performed to establish its service temperature limitations for the desired three to five years' service...|$|R

Conveniently this was also the hottest accessible part of the cooling circuit, giving a fast response when warming up.|$|R

Pillsbury developed the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) concept to address NASA’s second concern.

The database used for the calculation is first validated by comparison with systems available in the literature and by using an experimental approach. This study reveals the lack of optimization and the lack of data concerning alkali species and particularly K 2 O-rich compositions. An experimental approach has been used to determine the liquidus temperature of ashes by a classical quenching method. Experiments using <b>sealed</b> <b>capsules</b> largely prevent the volatilization of K 2 O. The liquidus temperature of three compositions with alkali and one without alkali were measured.

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{introduce}} wet-tissue scanning electron microscopy, a novel technique for direct imaging of wet tissue samples using backscattered electrons.

The samples several millimeters thick and imaged without sectioning, makes this technique suitable for rapid analysis of tissue specimens. We applied this technique to D-limonene-induced nephropathy where accumulation of hyaline protein droplets is induced in proximal and distal convoluted tubules of the kidney. Images obtained by scanning electron microscopy of hydrated kidney specimens exhibited superior resolution, contrast, and magnification compared with those obtained by conventional light microscopy of paraffin sections. The electron micrographs can be obtained {{within an hour of}} tissue removal, whereas preparation for light microscopy requires at least 1 day.

The flow and heat transfer characteristics are analysed for a range of modified Rayleigh numbers between 0. 5 and 300 and a correlation for Nusselt number is obtained which shows that the thermal behaviour is most strongly influenced by the modified Rayleigh number and that the vertical separation of the CPUs is more influential than the vertical position of the lower CPU...|$|R
50|$|Nespresso's {{hermetically}} <b>sealed</b> <b>capsules</b> {{are made}} of aluminum foil. Depending on the Nespresso machine being used, the flat top of the capsule is pierced when inserted into the machine and the compartment lever is lowered. Some machines make a single large hole, and others make a number of smaller holes. When the machine is activated it pumps hot water under high pressure into injector holes poked into the narrow end of the capsule upon insertion. This causes the flat bottom of the capsule to bow in, as this is made of thinner foil {{than the rest of}} the capsule. The base of the capsule holder (on which the capsule sits) has a number of raised squares which cause the foil to rupture at these points. The brewed coffee exits the capsule through these rupture holes and flows through a funnel nozzle into the coffee cup. As in pressure cookers, a safety pressure release valve inside the brewing chamber prevents an explosion from occurring if the normal coffee exhaust path becomes blocked.|$|R
