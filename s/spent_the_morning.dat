5|$|Joe Biden hung drywall at a Habitat for Humanity home in N.E.Washington,D.C. Biden's wife, Jill, their daughter, Ashley Biden, Michelle Obama and the Obamas' daughters, Malia and Sasha, <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium {{where they}} helped {{thousands}} of volunteers prepare more than 85,000 care packages destined for U.S.troops overseas. Later that evening, the President-elect hosted three separate bipartisan dinners {{to honor the}} service of JohnMcCain, ColinPowell and JoeBiden.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, the President {{hosted a}} large public {{reception}} at the White House on his final full day in office. Grant had made it known that he was unwilling {{to ride in the}} same carriage as Johnson, as was customary, and Johnson refused to go to the inauguration at all. Despite an effort by Seward to prompt a change of mind, he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of March 4 finishing last-minute business, and then shortly after noon rode from the White House to the home of a friend.|$|E

60|$|They had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>morning</b> on <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} prairie, keeping {{somewhat}} out {{of sight}} {{so as not to}} disturb any game that might appear. All had enjoyed an unusually hearty dinner, and were quite content to take it easy {{during the middle of the}} day. A faint breeze was blowing which was exceedingly pleasant, for <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> had been a trifle warm.|$|R
5|$|The {{children}} <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> in the resort's Kids' Club, {{then the}} family lunched at their apartment {{before heading to}} the pool. Kate took the last known photograph of Madeleine at 2:29 that afternoon, sitting by the pool next to her father and two-year-old sister. The children returned to Kids' Club, and at 18:00 their mother took them back to 5A, while their father went for a tennis lesson. The McCanns put the children to bed around 19:00. Madeleine was left asleep in short-sleeved, pink-and-white Marks and Spencer's Eeyore pyjamas, next to her comfort blanket and a soft toy, Cuddle Cat.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July, {{the day of}} the ceremony, pilgrims <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> {{and early}} {{afternoon}} exploring the landscape of the memorial park before congregating at the monument. For the ceremony, sailors from HMCS Saguenay provided the guard of honour. Also present were The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Band, French army engineers, and French-Moroccan cavalry who had fought on the site during the Second Battle of Artois. The ceremony itself was broadcast live by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission over shortwave radio, with facilities of the British Broadcasting Corporation transmitting the ceremony to Canada. Senior Canadian, British, and European officials, including French President Albert Lebrun, and a crowd of over 50,000 attended the event. Absent, though, was Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, it being well understood that he was generally not comfortable around veterans and felt it more appropriate for a war veteran in Cabinet to act as minister in attendance.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{attacked}} {{once again}} down the Graveyard Road, with 150 volunteers (nicknamed the Forlorn Hope detachment) {{leading the way}} with ladders and planks, followed by the divisions of Blair and Brig. Gen. James M. Tuttle, arranged in a long column of regiments, hoping to achieve a breakthrough by concentrating their mass on a narrow front. They were driven back {{in the face of}} heavy rifle fire. Blair's brigades under Cols. Giles A. Smith and T. Kilby Smith made it as far as a ridge 100 yards from Green's Redan, the southern edge of the Stockade Redan, from where they poured heavy fire into the Confederate position, but to no avail. Tuttle's division, waiting its turn to advance, did not have an opportunity to move forward. On Sherman's far right, the division of Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> attempting to get into position through a ravine of the Mint Spring Bayou.|$|E

60|$|He and the mate, after warning off {{the men who}} {{had come}} down to work, <b>spent</b> all <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> in {{sponging}} their crew, waiting with an impatience born of fatigue for the rash to come out. This impatience was shared by the crew, the state of mind of the cook after the fifth sponging calling for severe rebuke {{on the part of the}} skipper.|$|R
5|$|The Mortaras <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of 24 June {{attempting}} to have Feletti's order overruled {{by either the}} city's cardinal legate, Giuseppe Milesi Pironi Ferretti, or the Archbishop of Bologna, Michele Viale-Prelà, but they found that neither was in the city. Around noon, the Mortaras decided {{to take steps to}} make the separation as painless as possible. Edgardo's siblings were taken to visit relatives while Marianna reluctantly agreed to spend the evening with the wife of Giuseppe Vitta, a Jewish family friend. Around 17:00 Momolo visited San Domenico to make one last plea to Feletti. The inquisitor repeated all he had said to Padovani and Moscato the previous night and told Momolo not to worry as Edgardo would be well cared for, under the protection of the Pope himself. He warned that it would benefit no-one to make a scene when the carabinieri returned that evening.|$|E
5|$|When {{given the}} {{opportunity}} to host a public reception for President McKinley, fair organizers chose to site it in the Temple of Music—Louis L. Babcock, grand marshal of the Exposition, regarded the building as ideal for the purpose. The large auditorium was located close to the Esplanade, {{in the heart of the}} fair, and had doorways on each of its four sides. In addition to rows of chairs on the floor of the hall, it had spacious galleries. Babcock <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of September 6 making some physical arrangements for the reception. Floor seating was removed to create a broad aisle, running from the east doors through which the public would be admitted, to where McKinley would stand. Once members of the public shook hands with McKinley, they would continue on to exit the building. An American flag was draped behind the President, both to screen him from behind and for decoration—several potted plants were arrayed around his place to create an attractive scene. Besides its utility for other purposes, the ornate building was one of the architectural features of the fair.|$|E
5|$|Maitland showed Napoleon {{the great}} cabin, {{which he had}} placed at his disposal, {{and gave him a}} tour of his ship. At 10:30 a.m. the Superb {{anchored}} in the roadstead and Maitland went to make his report. Hotham approved of his arrangements, and agreed that Napoleon should be transported to England aboard the Bellerophon. He came aboard himself to meet the former Emperor, and a grand dinner was held in the great cabin, attended by Napoleon's retinue and British officers. The following day Napoleon visited Hotham on the Superb, and after his return, Maitland began the voyage to England in company with HMS Myrmidon. A routine was soon developed, with Napoleon usually taking a walk on deck around 5 p.m., followed by a formal dinner at 6 p.m. The sailors and officers removed their hats and kept their distance when Napoleon came on deck, only talking with him if he invited them to. The routine was broken slightly early in the morning of 23 July, when Napoleon appeared at dawn, as Bellerophon came in sight of Ushant, the last piece of French land visible {{for the remainder of the}} journey. He climbed up to the poop deck, attended by a midshipman, and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> watching the coastline slowly recede from view. He was joined by members of his retinue, though he did not speak to any of them.|$|E
6000|$|Berry had by {{this time}} arrived at that {{confidential}} state to which a third bottle always brings the well-regulated mind; {{and he made a}} clean confession to Cutler and myself of his numerous matrimonial annoyances. He was not allowed to dine out, he said, and but seldom to ask his friends to meet him at home. He never dared smoke a cigar for the life of him, not even in <b>the</b> stables. He <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> dawdling in eternal shops, the evenings at endless tea-parties, or in reading poems or missionary tracts to his wife. He was compelled to take physic whenever she thought he looked a little pale, to change his shoes and stockings whenever he came in from a walk. [...] "Look here," [...] said he, opening his chest, and shaking his fist at Dobus; [...] "look what Angelica and that infernal Dobus have brought me to." ...|$|R

50|$|Before {{working for}} Red Dragon FM, Harrold hosted the breakfast show on Radio Wyvern, serving Hereford and Worcester. Harrold worked at Red Dragon for 16 years, with {{the bulk of}} those years <b>spent</b> {{presenting}} <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> or 'breakfast', show. In 2008, he was moved from Breakfast to presenting weekday evenings from 8pm - midnight but this only lasted {{a couple of months}} after which he presented his last ever show at the station in August of the same year.|$|R
5|$|On {{the other}} side, Frederick {{commanded}} 27 battalions of infantry (17,000 men) and 43 squadrons of cavalry (5,000 horse), plus 72 companies of artillery, {{for a total}} of 22,000 men. He also had several of the siege guns from Leipzig, which arrived late in the morning. He <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> watching the French from the Goldacker manor rooftop in Rossbach. The initial stages of Allied movement convinced him that the Allies had started retreating southward towards their magazines; he sent out patrols to learn from the peasants what could be gleaned. They reported back that Soubise had taken the Weissenfels road; it led not only to that village, but also toward Freiburg, where Soubise could find supplies, or to Merseburg, where they would cut the Prussians off from the Saale. At about noon Frederick went to dinner, leaving the young captain Friedrich Wilhelm von Gaudi to observe French movements. Two hours later, his watch captain reported the French approaching. Although Gaudi's excited report at first appeared to confirm a French-Austrian retreat, Frederick observed that Allied columns, which from time to time became visible in the undulations of the ground, appeared to turn eastwards from Zeuchfeld. When Frederick saw for himself that hostile cavalry and infantry were already approaching Pettstädt, he realized his enemy's intentions: to attack him in the flank and rear, and break his communications line, if not crush him completely. They now offered him the battle for which he had maneuvered in vain, and he accepted it without hesitation.|$|E
25|$|Chris Hurley is a White Australian who {{was also}} aged 36 {{at the time of}} the incident. He had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> {{investigating}} complaints by sisters Gladys, Andrea and Anna Nugent that Roy Bramwell had assaulted them. One of the sisters needed to be airlifted to Townsville Hospital due to her condition as a result of Roy Bramwell's assault.|$|E
25|$|After his {{retirement}} from playing international rugby, Don-Wauchope kept his {{connections with the}} sport {{when he became a}} referee. He first officiated an international match in 1889 when he took charge of the Home Nations Championship encounter between Wales and Ireland. It had been a busy day for Don-Wauchope, as he had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> chairing a meeting of the International Rugby Board. He went on to referee another two international games, in 1890 and 1893.|$|E
60|$|The {{description}} of this scrimmage gave the worthy seaman {{a subject for}} conversation and food for meditation during {{the greater part of}} <b>the</b> time <b>spent</b> over <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> meal, and there is no saying how long he would have kept referring to and chuckling over it--to the great admiration and sympathy of the black fellows, who are, as a race, excessively fond of jocularity and fun--had not another of the denizens of the mangrove jungle diverted his attention and thoughts rather suddenly.|$|R

6000|$|... .... For {{three days}} after I wrote last, nothing at all {{happened}} here. I <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> on <b>the</b> cliff reading, and watching the sun-sparks raining on the sea. It's grand {{up there with the}} gorse all round, the gulls basking on the rocks, the partridges calling in the corn, and now and then a young hawk overhead. <b>The</b> afternoons I <b>spent</b> out in <b>the</b> orchard. The usual routine goes on at the farm all the time--cow-milking, bread-baking, John Ford riding in and out, Pasiance in her garden stripping lavender, talking to the farm hands; and the smell of clover, and cows and hay; the sound of hens and pigs and pigeons, the soft drawl of voices, the dull thud of the farm carts; and day by day the apples getting redder. Then, last Monday, Pasiance was away from sunrise till sunset--nobody saw her go--nobody knew where she had gone. It was a wonderful, strange day, a sky of silver-grey and blue, with a drift of wind-clouds, all the trees sighing a little, the sea heaving in a long, low swell, the animals restless, the birds silent, except the gulls with their old man's laughter and kitten's mewing.|$|R
25|$|The tour {{departure}} {{date was}} set for May 17, 1877, and Grant <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> at a champagne breakfast hosted by Pennsylvania Governor John F. Hartranft. Arrangements had been made for Grant and his party to join Indiana downstream, away from the crowds that had gathered to watch the departure. Boarding the steamer Twilight, Grant and his entourage sailed to rendezvous with Indiana in midstream near New Castle, Delaware, accompanied by a huge flotilla of decorated yachts and tugs and a chorus of ships' horns and whistles.|$|E
25|$|At dawn on 13 March, the Federal troops {{began to}} disembark. A small Rebel unit trying {{to contest the}} landing was quickly driven away by fire from the gunboats, as Col. Sinclair {{interpreted}} his orders to defend against a landing at Otter Creek narrowly. Burnside <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> getting men and equipment ashore. With the infantry came six boat (Navy) howitzers and two Army howitzers. Because of the weather, he decided to land his other artillery closer to the enemy lines, but dense fog soon closed in, {{and he could not}} communicate with the fleet. His remaining guns were not landed.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{seeing the}} {{multitude}} that had gathered, however, Yahya ordered his troops to surround {{the crowd and}} blockade the streets and alleys to prevent anyone from escaping. An offer was given for any Muhallabids to enter the palace, after which the gates to the building were shut. A signal was then given for the Zanj to slaughter the crowd, and nearly everyone who had assembled was killed. After the massacre was complete, the Zanj <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and afternoon searching for anyone else they could find; anyone who was rich was tortured in order to extract their possessions and then put to death, while the poor were killed immediately. At the same time, the mosque and city port were burned down on the orders of 'Ali ibn Aban, resulting in further casualties {{and the destruction of}} goods, merchandise and livestock.|$|E
60|$|On one {{of those}} days Ugh-lomi dropped a chunk of flint over the cliff. He saw it fall, and go {{bounding}} across the river bank into the river, and after laughing and thinking it over a little he tried another. This smashed a bush of hazel in the most interesting way. They <b>spent</b> all <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> dropping stones from the ledge, and in the afternoon they discovered this new and interesting pastime was also possible from the cliffbrow. The next day they had forgotten this delight. Or at least, it seemed they had forgotten.|$|R
50|$|Thompson <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> early <b>morning</b> hours {{trying to}} {{determine}} the enemy's numbers and disposition. Unable to do so, he placed his troops and artillery in ambush along the road and awaited the Union forces. The bulk of the Missouri State Guard force was hidden from view on wooded high ground that formed a U overlooking the road. Forward of the main body, Col. Aden Lowe's infantry regiment waited in a cornfield as bait. Close behind was a supporting 12-pounder cannon as well as three 6-pounders farther to the rear and flank.|$|R
60|$|Philip began now {{to paint}} in oils. He {{experienced}} a thrill of delight when first he used that grateful medium. He {{went out with}} Lawson in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> with his little box and sat by him painting a panel; it gave him so much satisfaction {{that he did not}} realise he was doing no more than copy; he was so much under his friend's influence that he saw only with his eyes. Lawson painted very low in tone, and they both saw the emerald of the grass like dark velvet, while the brilliance of the sky turned in their hands to a brooding ultramarine. Through July they had one fine day after another; it was very hot; and the heat, searing Philip's heart, filled him with languor; he could not work; his mind was eager with a thousand thoughts. Often he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> by <b>the</b> side of the canal {{in the shade of the}} poplars, reading a few lines and then dreaming for half an hour. Sometimes he hired a rickety bicycle and rode along the dusty road that led to the forest, and then lay down in a clearing. His head was full of romantic fancies. The ladies of Watteau, gay and insouciant, seemed to wander with their cavaliers among the great trees, whispering to one another careless, charming things, and yet somehow oppressed by a nameless fear.|$|R
25|$|The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Regiments {{participated in}} the Battle of Prairie Grove under their state designations. It is {{asserted}} that Col. Charles W. Adams treated his regiment of conscripts more like prisoners than soldiers, with the men being held under guard and herded around like cattle, for example. The regiment <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of December 7 near Prairie Grove church facing south. At about {{three o'clock in the}} afternoon it was ordered into the fight. Upon reaching Battle Ridge, the regiment was placed in a gap between Fagan's Brigade and Shelby's Brigade behind the south fence of the Borden orchard. The regiment fired a volley from behind the fence toward {{the right wing of the}} Twenty-sixth Indiana. When the Hoosiers fell back the regiment climbed over the fence and advanced north through the orchard (which was filled with fearfully mangled Union and Confederate corpses from an earlier clash) directly toward the Borden house. At approximately the place where the modern tour road crosses the orchard the regiment ran into a storm of fire from the left wing of the Thirty-seventh Illinois, including the left flank company which was armed with Colt revolving rifles. That is when the regiment broke. As both Adams and Hindman noted in their reports, many of the company officers went with the men.|$|E
500|$|Bellingham's {{presence}} in the House of Commons lobby on Monday 11 May, caused no particular suspicion; he had made several recent visits, sometimes asking journalists to confirm specific ministers' identities. Bellingham's activities earlier that day did not overtly indicate a man preparing desperate measures. He had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> writing letters [...] and visiting his wife's business partner, Mary Stevens, who was in London at the time. In the afternoon he had accompanied his landlady and her son {{on a visit to}} the European Museum, in the St James's district of London. From there he made his way alone to the parliament buildings in Westminster, arriving in the lobby shortly before five o'clock.|$|E
500|$|The 7th Armoured Division {{was slow}} to redeploy and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of 12 June {{continuing}} the attack on Tilly-sur-Seulles, according to its original orders. At 12:00 Erskine ordered Brigadier Hinde (commander of the 22nd Armoured Brigade) {{to move through the}} gap at once. With the 131st Infantry Brigade ready for action, the 56th Infantry Brigade was returned to the control of the 50th Northumbrian Division. The 7th Armoured Division armoured reconnaissance regiment, the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars began to reconnoitre the route {{and the rest of the}} division departed from Trungy at around 16:00. Four hours later, the main body approached Livry after an unopposed advance of , the last [...] of which were though German-held territory.|$|E
60|$|The {{examination}} {{confirmed his}} opinion {{that they were}} shut out by the Allinson claim, which must be respected, and they moved farther up the lode. It was dusk when they stopped work, and they <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> following <b>morning</b> digging holes and firing shots before deciding on their locations. These they roughly marked with piles of stones, but there were distances to be carefully measured and bearings verified before their stakes were driven, and while they were getting dinner another party arrived. The men were ragged and weary, {{and the appearance of}} several was far from prepossessing.|$|R
60|$|On {{reaching}} Saguenay, Mrs. Keith <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> first <b>morning</b> {{sitting outside}} her hotel. Rugged mountains with dark belts of pines straggling up their sides were spread about her, but {{she gave the}} wild grandeur of the landscape scanty attention as she consulted the engagement book in her hand. It contained {{a list of the}} friends she wished to entertain and the visits she had thought of making in England during the winter, and she wondered which could be shortened and whom she could put off, because it might be desirable to spend some time in Shropshire.|$|R
60|$|They <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> next <b>morning</b> toiling {{up a long}} ascent, {{and from}} its summit a {{prospect}} of majestic beauty burst upon them. The great peaks had grown nearer, the air was clear, and the girl sat, rapt, in the saddle, gazing at the vast snow-fields that glittered with ethereal brilliance, very high up against a cloudless sky. Then the wonderful blue coloring of the shadows streaking the white slopes caught her glance, and she found it unutterably lovely. Kermode, however, had an eye for other things and carefully searched the wide valley that stretched away beneath them.|$|R
