2500|$|Initially, BS1363 did {{not require}} the [...] and neutral pins to have {{insulating}} sleeves. Plugs made to the recent revisions of the standard have insulated sleeves to prevent finger contact with pins, and also to stop metal objects (for example, fallen window blind slats) from becoming live if lodged between the wall and a partly pulled out plug. [...] The length of the sleeves prevents any live contacts from being exposed while the plug is being inserted or removed. [...] An early method of <b>sleeving</b> the pins involving spring-loaded sleeves is described in the 1967 British Patent GB1067870. [...] The method actually adopted is described in the 1972 British Patent GB1292991. Plugs with such pins were available in the 1970s, a Southern Electricity/RoSPA safety pamphlet from 1978 encourages their use. [...] Sleeved pins became required by the standard in 1984.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the American National Standards Institute and American Water Works Association have {{standardized}} {{the use of}} polyethylene <b>sleeving</b> {{to protect}} ductile iron pipe {{from the effects of}} corrosion. A 2003 report by researchers from the National Research Council of Canada noted that [...] "both good and poor performances" [...] of polyethylene <b>sleeving</b> had been reported. However, a study in the Ductile Iron Pipe Research Association's Florida test site found that, compared with uncoated pipes exposed to a corrosive environment, pipes encased in loose polyethylene <b>sleeving</b> were [...] "in excellent condition". Based on a 2005 meta analysis of 1,379 pipe specimens, loose polyethylene <b>sleeving</b> was found to be highly effective at mitigating corrosion. The only environment for which the analysis found the polyethylene <b>sleeving</b> did not provide effective corrosion control was for [...] "uniquely severe" [...] environments, a classification of a rare but extremely corrosive environment. The analysis found that a lifespan of 37 years could be expected in these [...] "uniquely severe" [...] environments.|$|E

50|$|Polyethylene <b>sleeving</b> {{does have}} limitations. In European practice, {{its use in}} the absence of {{additional}} zinc and epoxy protective coatings is discouraged where natural soil resistivity is below 750 ohm/cm. Where resistivity is below 1500 ohm/cm and where the pipe is installed at or below the water table, where there are additional artificial soil contaminants and particularly stray currents again it is recommended for use in addition to zinc and epoxy coating. Because of the vulnerability of polyethylene to UV degradation, <b>sleeving,</b> or sleeved pipe should not be stored in sunlight, although carbon pigments included in the <b>sleeving</b> can provide some limited protection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sleeving</b> {{provided}} on rolls is often {{cut to length}} and used to cover radioactive material {{to prevent the spread}} of contamination during handling. Typically made of PVC or Polyurethane film formed into a flexible tube, <b>sleeving</b> can cover pipes, hoses, and cables to provide a protective layer. To handle odd-sized objects, adequately sized <b>sleeving</b> is opened so an object can be inserted into the tube which is then twisted to enclose the item at both ends. Tape can be used to secure the twists in place, and then cut free for handling. This is commonly referred to as “horsetailing”.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examine on {{the effectiveness}} of tapered <b>sleeve</b> connector in providing confinement effect to embedded reinforcement bar. The objectives of the investigation are to study the bond mechanism of grouted <b>sleeve</b> connector and to study the effects of confinement provided by the grouted <b>sleeve</b> connector. Two different configurations (welded bar <b>sleeve</b> and tapered <b>sleeve)</b> of <b>sleeve</b> connector were used in this study. Various <b>sleeve</b> diameters were used in this research to study their effects on the bond mechanism. The bond failure progression inside the grouted <b>sleeve</b> connector was observed visually as halved welded steel bar connector and tapered head connector were used. The experimental works consisted two phases where phase I was the testing of plain grouted <b>sleeve.</b> Phase II involved the testing steel fibre reinforced grout <b>sleeve.</b> Steel fibres of 0 %, 0. 5 %, 0. 75 % and 1. 0 % were introduced to the connector in a way so the grout inside the connector will exhibit post-cracking behaviour. Pull-out tests were carried out and it was observed that the performance of tapered <b>sleeve</b> was better than welded bar <b>sleeve</b> due to higher confinement level.

40|$|This study devised {{and drew}} custom <b>sleeve</b> {{patterns}} {{by using a}} regression equation with the data from 7 models along with the <b>sleeve</b> that was slightly modified to make the general-purpose <b>sleeve</b> pattern.

Next, 30 panel members participated in a sight test of the compatibility of the <b>sleeves</b> to examine the validity of the <b>sleeve</b> drafting method acquired using the regression equation. The test proved that the custom <b>sleeve</b> pattern and the general-purpose <b>sleeve</b> pattern were more suitable for the characteristics of arm structures.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the performance of}} the proposed grouted <b>sleeve</b> connector with and without steel spiral as transverse reinforcement under incremental tensile load until failure. The connector utilized mild steel pipe as <b>sleeve</b> where the <b>sleeve</b> consists of external and internal <b>sleeve</b> with the diameter of the external <b>sleeve</b> is larger than internal <b>sleeve.</b> The mild steel pipe and the steel spiral are used to confine and reinforce the grout and the two discontinued bars spliced end-to-end configuration in the <b>sleeve.</b> The test shows that, there are two modes of failure which were bar slipped and bar fractured outside the <b>sleeve.</b> Eleven specimens out of fourteen shows satisfactory results as it failed due to bar fractured outside the <b>sleeve</b> and achieve satisfactory ultimate tensile capacity. The stiffness and the ductility of the connectors also satisfy. Grouted <b>sleeve</b> connectors with steel spiral perform better compared to connectors without a steel spiral. The test shows that {{the performance of the}} grouted <b>sleeve</b> connector with or without steel spiral was governed by grout-bar bond, anchorage length and confinement action provided by the <b>sleeve</b> and the steel spiral. The connectors have a potential to be used in connecting precast concrete structure...|$|R
30|$|Figure  7 {{also shows}} the stress arch is most obvious {{within a certain}} range from the <b>sleeve</b> end. Within the range, the soil plug {{undertakes}} the {{major part of the}} internal shaft resistance, and the stress value increases with the penetration depth. The simulation results accord with the study of Lobo-Guerrero and Vallejo (2007), the contact stress mainly was concentrated at the bottom of <b>sleeve</b> end, and was delivered to the interior of the <b>sleeve</b> in a short distance from the <b>sleeve</b> end. During <b>sleeve</b> jacking, the void ratio is slightly smaller than the void ratio in initial stress state due to the monotonic shear between the soils and <b>sleeve</b> wall. Compared to the <b>sleeve</b> jacking, the arching effect of vibratory <b>sleeve</b> driving is relatively weaker, since the cyclic shear between the soils and <b>sleeve</b> wall makes void ratio decrease to the minimum value (Henke and Grabe 2008). The soil plug is compacted under vibratory action, which makes the soils at the bottom of <b>sleeve</b> difficult to be squeezed into the <b>sleeve.</b> Consequently, the arching effect is relatively weaker.|$|R

30|$|When the <b>sleeve</b> {{is being}} driven, the <b>sleeve</b> {{transfers}} the periodic vibrating load to the soils around the <b>sleeve</b> (Ekanayake et al. 2013).

Compared to the infinite soils outside the <b>sleeve,</b> the soil plug inside the <b>sleeve</b> undergoes stronger cyclic shear force {{transferred from the}} <b>sleeve</b> wall. Therefore, the fluctuation of the internal shaft resistance is more obvious {{than that of the}} external shaft resistance. As the result, the soil strength and cohesion decrease under cyclic shearing action. Because of the decrease in the soil strength and cohesion, the soil plug becomes partially-plugged, and the penetration resistance of <b>sleeve</b> is much smaller than those by other installation methods.|$|R
