2500|$|Fourth, petitioners {{note that}} Proposition 15, the {{initiative}} {{out of which}} 25524.2 arose, and companion provisions in California's so-called nuclear laws, are more clearly written with safety purposes in mind. 27 [...] It is suggested that 25524.2 shares a common heritage with these laws and should be presumed to have been enacted for the same purposes. [...] The <b>short</b> <b>answer</b> here is that these other state laws are not before the Court, and indeed, Proposition 15 was not passed; these provisions and their pedigree do not taint {{other parts of the}} Warren-Alquist Act.|$|E
40|$|The {{examination}} of pair-list answers involving RCIC violations indicates that their derivation in the covert syntax {{is subject to}} strict constraints imposed on oblique move-ment and clusters of wh-phrases formed thereby. This makes the LF-pied-piping (LFPP) mechanism proposed in Nishigauchi (1990) the sole viable option. Therefore the LFPP mechanism is motivated independent of the RCIC at LF. Finally we show that scrambling inside the relative clause yields the edge effect, thereby making <b>short</b> pair-list <b>answers</b> in RCIC-violation environment possible.

Court Line expanded rapidly in many directions, some of which were both logical and justifiable, others not. The overall management was throughout inadequate and it was in any event never supported by the necessary financial control. This meant that as Court Line expanded, it became progressively vulnerable to any substantial setback in any of its areas of activities. When a serious setback occurred, triggered off by the oil crisis of autumn 1973, it immediately affected the shipping, aviation, and leisure divisions. The group was so highly geared, so structured and having such inadequate financial control, that it might well have been brought down by a substantial reverse in any of its major activities. As it was the cumulative effect on all three divisions, when all the cash resources which would otherwise have been available had been invested unprofitably in the Caribbean, meant that the position progressively deteriorated and rendered the collapse in August 1974 unavoidable." ...|$|E

[...] Recent seismic imaging from Geological Survey of Canada employees supported lithoprobe studies {{in the region of}} Mount Cayley in which scientists found a large reflector interpreted to be a pool of molten rock roughly [...] below the surface. The existence of hot springs at Mount Meager and Mount Cayley indicates that magmatic heat is still present beneath or near these volcanoes. This long history of volcanic activity along a still active plate boundary indicates that volcanic eruptions in the Garibaldi Belt have not ended and risks for future eruptions remain.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Chua {{emphasized}} that fears of {{abuse of power}} by the Parliament should {{not lead to a}} denial of the power to amend the Constitution or restrict this power. He referred to Loh Kooi Choon v. Government of Malaysia (1977), where the Malaysian Federal Court said: [...] "The fear of abuse of Parliament's power to amend the Constitution in any way they think fit cannot be an argument against the existence of such power, for abuse of power can always be struck down". Furthermore, Chua asserted that allowing the courts to impose limitations on the legislature through the basic features doctrine, a judge-made rule, would amount to the judiciary usurping Parliament's legislative function. A similar view was expressed in Phang Chin Hock by the Chief Justice of Malaya, Raja Azlan Shah: [...] "A <b>short</b> <b>answer</b> to the fallacy of this doctrine is that it concedes to the court a more potent power of constitutional amendment through judicial legislation than the organ for and clearly chosen by the Constitution for the exercise of the amending power." [...] This could infringe the separation of powers doctrine and blur the distinction between the functions of the judiciary and the legislature.|$|E

2500|$|The Labour Party came {{to power}} in 1997 with a {{manifesto}} saying, [...] "We will ensure greater protection for wildlife. We have advocated new measures to promote animal welfare, including a free vote in Parliament on whether hunting with hounds should be banned." [...] A new private member's bill, introduced by Michael Foster MP, received a second reading with 411 MPs voting in support, but failed due to lack of parliamentary time. The Burns Report in 2000 concluded that forms of fox hunting [...] "seriously compromise the welfare of the fox", but (in line with its remit) did not draw any conclusion on whether hunting should be banned or should continue. In a later debate in the House of Lords, the inquiry chairman, Lord Burns also stated that [...] "Naturally, people ask whether we were implying that hunting is cruel... The <b>short</b> <b>answer</b> to that question is no. There was not sufficient verifiable evidence or data safely to reach views about cruelty. It is a complex area." [...] Following the Burns inquiry, the Government introduced an 'options bill' which allowed each House of Parliament to choose between a ban, licensed hunting, and self-regulation. The House of Commons voted for a banning bill and the House of Lords for self-regulation. The 2001 general election was then called and the bill ran out of parliamentary time.|$|E

[...] Music theorist Daniel Harrison contests that the group produced work that could [...] "almost" [...] be considered art music in the Western classical tradition, and that group's innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. He explains, [...] "The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces." [...] While the group [...] "went into the great void beyond", such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the classically minded at the time. Harrison concludes: [...] "What influences could these innovations then have? The <b>short</b> <b>answer</b> is, not much. Smiley Smile, Wild Honey, Friends, and 20/20 sound like few other rock albums; they are sui generis. … It must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys' experiments was hardly motivation for imitation. In the end, we must conclude that the Beach Boys' late-1960s experiments were not reproducible." ...|$|E
