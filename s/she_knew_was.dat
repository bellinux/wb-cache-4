2500|$|Wray's {{reasons for}} not taking that advice were simple: Such {{personal}} knowledge as she had of Trumbo was over a decade old, everything else <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> hearsay, and whatever was said about him or anyone else in The Hollywood Reporter was almost certainly based on gossip, if not entirely made up. [...] Abstract philosophical ideas hotly debated over too many drinks at studio parties did not, to her mind, constitute subversive activity; and to just wave her finger {{in the direction of}} a name she didn't know -- something they actually suggested -- was unthinkable.|$|E

When Usagi wished to be a normal girl at the end of the first series, everyone's {{memories}} were magically hidden, including Mamoru's. However, Mamoru subconsciously still wanted to protect Usagi, so his memories separated from him and concentrated into Moonlight Knight. Moonlight Knight could co-exist in the same space and time as Mamoru. As with Tuxedo Mask, Usagi thought every cute guy <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> him, and was surprised when she discovered who he was. Once Mamoru recovered his memories, Moonlight Knight disappeared and rejoined with Mamoru. Mamoru returned to being Tuxedo Mask once again after that point on. Moonlight Knight mainly dresses in Arabian robes and carries a saber. He also throws white roses, instead of Tuxedo Mask's trademark red roses.|$|E

60|$|What <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> {{lost in a}} most affectionate embrace; but Caroline {{would not}} stay any longer, and left Marian as usual, regretting {{everything}} that had passed.|$|E
60|$|The {{only man}} <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> her father; and, {{as he was}} {{something}} large, looming, a kind of Godhead, he embraced all manhood for her, and other men were just incidental.|$|E
60|$|Faster, wilder, and {{stranger}} {{the music}} rose; but Elma sat still, her breast heaving hard, and her breath panting, yet otherwise as still and motionless as a statue. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> Miss Ewes could tell exactly how <b>she</b> felt. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> trying her; <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> tempting {{her to get}} up and dance; and yet, she was not one bit afraid of this strange weird woman, as she'd been afraid that sad morning at home of her own mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will come}} and dine," [...] he assented quietly. [...] "I am afraid that I cannot promise more than that. Lady Cynthia, as <b>she</b> <b>knows,</b> <b>is</b> always welcome at The Sanctuary." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “Oh, very well, trés bien,” said Mrs. Stossen reluctantly; {{in moments}} of flurry such French as <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> not under very good control. “Là, à l’autre côté de la porte, est un cochon—” ...|$|E
60|$|Every word he {{said she}} could have anticipated, so plain the {{situation}} seemed to her now. And every word he said <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> the truth. Yet her cool common sense struggled against it.|$|E

60|$|The {{girl was}} astonished. This, <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>was</b> splendid audacity, {{for the man}} had already staked very heavily on the crop he had sown, and while the daring of it stirred her she sat silent a moment.|$|E
