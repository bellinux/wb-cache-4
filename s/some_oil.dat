5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Keyser Creek {{was a clear}} stream until it reached the repair shops of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. At this point, it {{received}} <b>some</b> <b>oil</b> and refuse. At the Capouse Shaft, the creek washed an ash bank and a culm bank and was contaminated with some sulfur. More dirty waste materials drained into the creek at the Archbald Colliery and a fertilizer plant also discharged waste into it.|$|E
5|$|German {{successes in}} Europe {{encouraged}} Japan to increase pressure on European governments in Southeast Asia. The Dutch government {{agreed to provide}} Japan <b>some</b> <b>oil</b> supplies from the Dutch East Indies, but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941. In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United States, United Kingdom and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo. At the same time, Japan was planning an invasion of the Soviet Far East, intending to capitalize off the German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.|$|E

5|$|Though the Admiralty {{arranged}} {{for some of}} the ships to be salvaged, most were left {{at the bottom of the}} sound until entrepreneur Ernest Cox bought the salvage rights and began to raise the remaining ships in the early 1920s. Bremse presented particular challenges. She had come to rest perched precariously on a rock, which sloped away dramatically, causing fears that she might slip off and sink in deeper water. Cox's salvage team sealed her bulkheads and divided the hull into watertight compartments. The hull was patched up and an airlock fitted, but the team ran into difficulties with the large amount of oil which covered the wreck, more than had been found in any other of the ships salvaged previously. A three-man team using oxyacetylene torches ignited <b>some</b> <b>oil,</b> causing an explosion. The men escaped without serious injuries, and thereafter small explosions and fires were common over the two months it took to prepare the ship, though no one was injured.|$|E

25|$|The company found lots of gas {{but also}} <b>some</b> <b>oil.</b> In 1985, Panarctic became a {{commercial}} oil producer on an experimental scale.

The company delivered its largest annual volume of oil – 50,000 m³ (432,424 barrels) – to southern markets in 1988. Production continued until 1996.|$|E

25|$|After dry roasting, peanuts {{are removed}} from the oven as quickly as {{possible}} and directly placed in a blower-cooler cylinder. There are suction fans in the metal cylinder that can pull a large volume of air through, so the peanuts can be cooled more efficiently. The peanuts will not be dried out because cooling can help retain <b>some</b> <b>oil</b> and moisture. The cooling process is completed when the temperature in the cylinder reaches 30℃.|$|E
25|$|From 1914 to 1917, {{several more}} oil fields were {{discovered}} {{across the country}} include the emblematic Bolivar Coastal Field; however World War I slowed significant development of the industry. Due to the difficulty in purchasing and transporting the necessary tools and machinery, <b>some</b> <b>oil</b> companies were forced to forego drilling until after the war. By the end of 1917, the first refining operations began at the San Lorenzo refinery to process the Mene Grande field production, and the first significant exports of Venezuelan oil by Caribbean Petroleum left from the San Lorenzo terminal. By the end of 1918, petroleum appeared {{for the first time}} on the Venezuelan export statistics at 21,194 metric tons.|$|E
25|$|The second law of {{thermodynamics}} {{states that}} any closed-loop cycle can only convert {{a fraction of}} the heat produced during combustion into mechanical work. The rest of the heat, called waste heat, must be released into a cooler environment during the return portion of the cycle. The fraction of heat released into a cooler medium must be equal or larger than the ratio of absolute temperatures of the cooling system (environment) and the heat source (combustion furnace). Raising the furnace temperature improves the efficiency but complicates the design, primarily by the selection of alloys used for construction, making the furnace more expensive. The waste heat cannot be converted into mechanical energy without an even cooler cooling system. However, it may be used in cogeneration plants to heat buildings, produce hot water, or to heat materials on an industrial scale, such as in <b>some</b> <b>oil</b> refineries, plants, and chemical synthesis plants.|$|E
5000|$|Oil {{additives}} are {{chemical compounds}} that improve the lubricant performance of base oil (or oil [...] "base stock").

25|$|There is a {{difference}} between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source. Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in <b>some</b> <b>oil</b> fields has led to using natural gas to fuel enhanced oil recovery. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most Athabasca tar sands plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to ethanol fuel produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.|$|E
500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>oil</b> shales are {{suitable}} source for sulfur, ammonia, alumina, soda ash, and nahcolite which occur as shale oil extraction byproducts. <b>Some</b> <b>oil</b> shales {{can also be}} used for uranium and other rare chemical element production. During 19461952, a marine variety of Dictyonema shale was used for uranium production in Sillamäe, Estonia, and during 19501989 alum shale was used in Sweden for the same purpose. Oil shale gas {{can also be used}} as a substitute for natural gas. After World War II, Estonian-produced oil shale gas was used in Leningrad and the cities in North Estonia. [...] However, at the current price level of natural gas, this is not economically feasible.|$|E

A few minutes later, she joined other ships in some sporadic gunfire but failed to prove that a submarine was in the area.|$|E
500|$|Thanks to the {{historic}} oil price increases of 2003–2008, OPEC revenues approximated an unprecedented US$1trillion per year in 2008 and 2011–2014.
