50|$|To {{prevent the}} helmet <b>straps</b> from {{impairing}} the drivers vision, {{there is a}} design where the <b>straps</b> are held horizontal to prevent the <b>straps</b> from sagging. There are also designs in which no apparatus is needed to keep <b>straps</b> out of the drivers sight. Helmet <b>straps</b> {{are made up of}} shock absorbing material used while climbing or for security when working at high elevations. The <b>straps</b> include a woven nylon that requires up to 475 lbs. of force to cause the <b>straps</b> to tear. <b>Straps</b> that are stretchable allow the drivers brain to slow down to avoid brain damage caused from the brain slamming into the skull; but the <b>straps</b> do not let the head move too far forward to cause neck injuries.|$|R

5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather <b>strap</b> from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the <b>strap</b> from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E

50|$|Some {{filament}} tapes (or <b>strapping</b> tapes) {{are sometimes}} used similarly to <b>strapping.</b>|$|R
50|$|Corded and woven <b>strapping</b> are {{available}} in several constructions, primarily involving polyester and rayon. Some types are reusable. Because this system uses a buckle for a joint, corded and woven <b>strapping</b> can have a larger system strength than steel banding. Corded polyester <b>strapping</b> also has a higher elongation than other <b>strapping</b> systems, which gives it an ideal memory for sea and rail shipments. Because corded and woven polyester <b>straps</b> are light and soft, they are also a safer alternative to steel banding.|$|R

5|$|The seventh {{match was}} the main event from SmackDown, a Punjabi Prison match for the World Heavyweight Championship, where, Batista, defended the title against The Great Khali. In the match, two giant wooden cages {{surrounded}} the ring, and, to win, a competitor had to escape both structures. After both men prevented the other from escaping, Khali utilized a leather <b>strap</b> as a weapon. Batista later used the leather <b>strap</b> and attempted to climb over inner cage, but Khali stopped him and squeezed Batista's head with a Vise Grip. Khali then called for a door to be opened but Batista struck him with a low blow. The match ended when Khali had climbed over the inner cage and began climbing the outer cage. Batista then mounted the inner cage, jumped to the second cage and, overtaking Khali, climbed to the ground, thereby winning the match and retaining the title.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a <b>strap.</b> Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the <b>strap</b> on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
