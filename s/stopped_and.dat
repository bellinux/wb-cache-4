40|$|The {{capacity}} to <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> search citizens {{is a key}} part of the police crime reduction repertoire. This study presents findings from a survey of all police officers at one police station in a southern English town in July 2004, looking at <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> search experiences plus a glimpse at officer views on the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The Act introduced a ‘major extension to the existing powers of <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> search’ (Home Office (as cited in Keogh, 2004)). However, fewer than half of officers reported having received any formal training on the changes to <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> search procedure, and fewer than 40 per cent of officers believed that changes introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 had made <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> search ‘better’ from their perspective. Overall, and consistent with other research, a small proportion of officers made a disproportionate amount of each of <b>stops,</b> searches <b>and</b> arrests, which could have implications for training and resource allocation. Suggestions are made for further research to examine the impact of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 upon police <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> searches, and for research to examine crime reduction effectiveness...|$|R
