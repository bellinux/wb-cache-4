50|$|A <b>sporophyll</b> is a leaf {{that bears}} sporangia. Both microphylls and megaphylls can be sporophylls. In heterosporous plants, sporophylls (whether they are microphylls or megaphylls) bear either megasporangia {{and thus are}} called megasporophylls, or microsporangia and are called microsporophylls. The overlap of the prefixes and roots makes these terms a {{particularly}} confusing subset of botanical nomenclature.|$|E
50|$|The female cones open, with 13-22 cm long sporophylls with 2-4 ovules per <b>sporophyll</b> on a {{lanceolate}} triangular lamina with an apical spine.

50|$|The female cones are open, with sporophylls 16-21 cm long, {{with two}} to four ovules per <b>sporophyll.</b> The lamina is {{narrowly}} triangular, with toothed margins and an apical spine. The sarcotesta is yellow-brown with a waxy coating, the sclerotesta ovoid and flattened. The male cones are solitary, ovoid, 16-20 cm long and 7-10 cm diameter, brown, and with an upturned apical spine.|$|E
50|$|Unusually for the lycopods, which {{generally}} have microphylls {{with a single}} unbranched vein, the microphylls of Selaginella species contain a branched vascular trace. In Selaginella, each microphyll and <b>sporophyll</b> has a small scale-like outgrowth called a ligule {{at the base of}} the upper surface. The plants are heterosporous with spores of two different size classes, known as megaspores and microspores.|$|E

50|$|Male {{and female}} <b>sporophylls</b> are spirally {{aggregated}} into determinate cones that grow along the axis. Female <b>sporophylls</b> are simple, appearing peltate, with a barren stipe and an expanded and thickened lamina with 2 (rarely 3 or more) sessile ovules inserted {{on the inner}} (axis facing) surface and directed inward. The seeds are angular, with the inner coat hardened and the outer coat fleshy. They are often brightly colored, with 2 cotyledons.|$|R

5000|$|Leaves also {{function}} to store chemical {{energy and water}} (especially in succulents) and may become specialised organs serving other functions, such as tendrils of peas and other legumes, the protective spines of cacti and the insect traps in carnivorous plants such as Nepenthes and Sarracenia. Leaves are the fundamental structural units from which cones are constructed in gymnosperms (each cone scale is a modified megaphyll leaf known as a <b>sporophyll)</b> and from which flowers are constructed in flowering plants.|$|E
50|$|A second species, A. parvulum, was {{described}} in 2011. The species differ in size overall; for example, the largest strobili found were 90 mm long in A. subverticillatum, but only 17 mm long in A. parvulum. The relative size of the <b>sporophylls</b> and the sporangia is also different: they were roughly the same height in A. parvulum, whereas the sporangia were a half {{to a third of}} the height of the <b>sporophylls</b> in A. subverticillatum.|$|R
50|$|Fossils {{ascribed}} to the Lycopodiophyta first appear in the Silurian period, along {{with a number of}} other vascular plants. Phylogenetic analysis places them {{at the base of the}} vascular plants; they are distinguished by their microphylls and by transverse dehiscence of their sporangia (as contrasted with longitudinal in other vascular plants). Sporangia of living species are borne on the upper surfaces of microphylls (called <b>sporophylls).</b> In some groups, these <b>sporophylls</b> are clustered into strobili.|$|R
40|$|A new lycophyte species, Selaginella longistrobilina P. S. Wang, X. Y. Wang & Li Bing Zhang (Selaginellaceae), is {{described}} and illustrated from limestone hills in central Guizhou, China. Selaginella longistrobilina is most similar to S. prostrata H. S. Kung {{in the shape}} of the microphylls and in the arrangement, shape, and size of the <b>sporophylls.</b> However, the new species has longer strobili to 2. 5 cm, and the <b>sporophylls</b> are often navicular adaxially, while S. prostrata has strobili only 3 - 4 mm, and the <b>sporophylls</b> are flattened adaxially. Selaginella longistrobilina is only known from central Guizhou, while S. prostrata is more widely distributed from Hunan, Sichuan to Yunnan in China. A new combination, S. prostrata (H. S. Kung) Li Bing Zhang, based on Lycopodioides prostrata H. S. Kung, is made and lectotypified herein...|$|R
5000|$|Leaf: The green, {{photosynthetic}} part of {{the plant}} is technically a megaphyll and in ferns, it {{is often referred to}} as a frond. New leaves typically expand by the unrolling of a tight spiral called a [...] "crozier" [...] or [...] "fiddlehead fern". This uncurling of the leaf is termed [...] "circinate vernation". Leaves are divided into two types a trophophyll and a <b>sporophyll.</b> A trophophyll frond is a vegetative leaf analogous to the typical green leaves of seed plants that does not produce spores, instead only producing sugars by photosynthesis. A <b>sporophyll</b> frond is a fertile leaf that produces spores borne in sporangia that are usually clustered to form sori. In most ferns, fertile leaves are morphologically very similar to the sterile ones, and they photosynthesize in the same way. In some groups, the fertile leaves are much narrower than the sterile leaves, and may even have no green tissue at all (e.g., Blechnaceae, Lomariopsidaceae). The anatomy of fern leaves can either be simple or highly divided. In tree ferns, the main stalk that connects the leaf to the stem (known as the stipe), often have multiple leafy. The leafy structures that grow from the stipe are known as [...] "pinnae" [...] and are often again divided into smaller pinnules.|$|E
50|$|Schizaea {{is a small}} genus of {{specialized}} ferns in the family Schizaeaceae. Common names include curlygrass fern and comb fern. Some species are very small and inconspicuous, and so may often be overlooked in nature. The genus is distinctive {{and not at all}} like the common conception of a fern; the barren fronds (trophophylls) are grass-like, and the spore-bearing fertile frond (<b>sporophyll)</b> is similar, but with a small, pinnate fertile segment at its apex. The upper surface of the pinnules bear the sessile capsules.Various of the roughly two dozen species have been reported from widely separated regions, including much of the tropical Old and New World, parts of the Eastern USA, Chile, the Falkland Islands, and various Pacific islands, including several islands of New Caledonia, as well as Australia and New Zealand. In Africa at least two species are endemic to South Africa.|$|E
50|$|Selaginella apoda can be subcategorized {{into the}} {{subgenus}} Stachygynandrum. The genus Selaginella {{has been subjected}} to taxonomic treatments, including the arrangement of a plant’s sporangia as well as the types of spores the plant species produces. In terms of phylogenetics, S. apoda falls under the S. pallescens OPHA clade, species that are native to the American continent and have one type of <b>sporophyll</b> {{in the form of a}} megaspore network. In the Selaginellaceae family, microsporangia are larger than the megasporangia and the strobili are quadrangular in shape or flat. Selaginella apoda, under the synonymous name of Lycopodium apodum, can be identified by stomata spread across the plane of the adaxial sides of its leaves, the leaf margins of the plant are all similar to each other, the diameter of their megaspores within the range of 0.29 - 0.35 millimeters, and the plant has acute to attenuate apices on at least 5 of their leaves.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} kelps, Alaria {{demonstrate}} a heteromorphic, sporic life history, with a macroscopic, dominant sporophyte, and a microscopic gametophyte. Unique to the genus Alaria {{is that the}} sori of the unilocular sporangia are restricted to certain blades, the <b>sporophylls.</b> The <b>sporophylls</b> are formed as lateral blades from the stipe. Most species are perennial; after reproduction, the blade sloughs off, leaving the stipe and meristem. The persisting meristem produces a new blade {{at the beginning of}} the next growing season.|$|R
5000|$|The genus Isoetes, the quillworts, {{are related}} to ferns, with fossil {{evidence}} dating back more than 150 million years. Isoetes eludens grows only 6 cm tall, with root hairs growing 5 mm under the soil surface. It has up to twelve green <b>sporophylls,</b> or leaves that produce spores, growing in a tight cluster. Like other quillworts, the <b>sporophylls</b> are hollow and rounded like a quill. The spore-producing part of the leaf is at the base, producing both megaspores and microspores.|$|R
50|$|Conifers, like Ginkgo and cycads, produce microsporophylls, {{aggregated}} into pollen strobili. However, unlike {{these other}} groups, ovules are produced on cone scales, which are modified shoots rather than <b>sporophylls.</b>|$|R
