The two brothers, Anthony and Oliver Hughes, were driving home in a white Citroen GS <b>Special</b> <b>car</b> after repairing a lorry with Oliver wearing overalls like the IRA unit. About 130 yards from the base, SAS members opened fire on them from behind, killing Anthony (the driver) and badly wounding Oliver. The Citroen had approximately 34 bullet holes.

Anthony's widow was later compensated by the British Government for the death of her husband.|$|E
500|$|Kahne {{appeared}} in victory lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 170,000 to celebrate his sixth win of the season earning him $305,889. Kahne was delighted with his victory and thanked the people who worked on his car's transmission and rear-end: [...] "We had a great car. It was unbelievable all night. I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and I thought I had to break something. This isn't the <b>special</b> <b>car.</b> This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." [...] Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: “I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points.” Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and they said, {{we do not have a}} wheel loose, we know we got them tight." ...|$|E

A world record was not awarded, however, because the run was not timed by the American Automobile Association and as such could not be verified. It is considered by some that the record speed was claimed by IMCA for the promotional benefits that it would offer. If true, this record would have represented a record speed [...] faster than the official record, set by a car with a quarter less power than the current holder, five years before the official record reached this level.|$|E
2500|$|In June, Campbell left Portugal for Spain, {{going to}} Salamanca {{and then to}} Toledo.

Leaving Toledo on 30 June 1937, Campbell was driven to Talavera where he suffered [...] a serious fall, twisting his left hip. The following day, the <b>special</b> <b>car</b> travelled southwards from the front, ending its lightning tour in Seville. This visit appears to have been Campbell's only frontline experience of the war. However, that would not keep him from later suggesting that he had seen far more action than he had.

2500|$|The shells were {{propelled}} {{at such a}} {{high velocity}} that each successive shot wore away {{a considerable amount of}} steel from the rifled bore. Each shell was sequentially numbered according to its increasing diameter, and had to be fired in numeric order, lest the projectile lodge in the bore, and the gun explode. Also, when the shell was rammed into the gun, the chamber was precisely measured to determine the difference in its length: a few inches off would cause a great variance in the velocity, and with it, the range. Then, with the variance determined, the additional quantity of propellant was calculated, and its measure taken from a <b>special</b> <b>car</b> and added to the regular charge. After 65 rounds had been fired, each of progressively larger caliber to allow for wear, the barrel was sent back to Krupp and rebored to a caliber of [...] with a new set of shells.|$|E

2500|$|York's heroism went unnoticed in the United States press, even in Tennessee, {{until the}} {{publication}} of the April 26, 1919 issue of the Saturday Evening Post, which had a circulation in excess of 2 million. In an article titled [...] "The Second Elder Gives Battle", journalist George Patullo, who had learned of York's story while touring battlefields earlier in the year, laid out the themes that have dominated York's story ever since: the mountaineer, his religious faith and skill with firearms, patriotic, plainspoken and unsophisticated, an uneducated man who [...] "seems to do everything correctly by intuition." [...] In response, the Tennessee Society, a group of Tennesseans living in New York City, arranged celebrations to greet York upon his return to the United States, including a 5-day furlough to allow for visits to New York City and Washington, D.C. York arrived in Hoboken, New Jersey, on May 22, stayed at the Waldorf Astoria, and attended a formal banquet in his honor.

2500|$|In their 2006 {{readership}} survey, {{readers of}} Car Design News voted the Aston Martin V8 Vantage {{as the best}} current production car design. The survey results were based on over 1000 responses, most from working automotive designers and students of industrial and automotive design. The Vantage was also voted one of Automobile magazine's 2007 [...] "All Stars" [...] for its performance, road manners, and design. The V8 Vantage {{is also one of}} the only two cars to be added to [...] "The DB9 section," [...] – a fridge reserved for the super-"cool" [...] – on the BBC's Top Gear (on which it is described as the baby Aston to differentiate it from the V12 powered DB9). The program rates cars from seriously un-cool to sub-zero. The fridge was an extra category added when the presenters deemed the Aston Martin DB9 too cool for the sub-zero category. In the 2005 awards, Jeremy Clarkson declared the V8 Vantage as Best Sounding Car of the Year and The Coolest Car of the Year, while the award winner was actually the Porsche 911. While the V8 Vantage remains a rare and <b>special</b> <b>car</b> by any standard, the success of the model is highlighted by the completion of chassis number 10,000 – a specially ordered Onyx Coupe delivered to a customer in USA – in the first half of 2008. While the production of 10,000 cars is a tiny number by the standards of typical car manufacturers, it is a significant milestone for an Aston Martin model – the DB9 being the only other Aston Martin model to have achieved that figure.|$|E
