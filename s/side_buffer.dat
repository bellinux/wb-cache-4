40|$|Fast {{broadcasting}} (FB) is {{a popular}} near video-on-demand system where a video is divided into equal size segments those are repeatedly transmitted {{over a number of}} channels following a pattern. For user satisfaction, it is required to reduce the initial user waiting time and client <b>side</b> <b>buffer</b> requirement at streaming. Use of additional channels can achieve the objective. However, some augmentation is required to the basic FB scheme as it lacks any mechanism to realise a well defined relationship among the segment sizes at channel transition. Lack of correspondence between the segments causes intermediate waiting for the clients while watching videos. Use of additional channel requires additional bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a modified FB scheme that achieves zero initial clients waiting time and provides a mechanism to control client <b>side</b> <b>buffer</b> requirement at streaming without requiring additional channels. We present several results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FB scheme over the existing ones. Comment: 2014 9 th International Forum on Strategic Technology (IFOST...|$|E
40|$|A {{conventional}} Network-on-Chip (NoC) router uses input buffers {{to store}} in-flight packets. These buffers improve performance, but consume significant power. It {{is possible to}} bypass these buffers when they are empty, reducing dynamic power, but static buffer power, and dynamic power when buffers are utilized, remain. To improve energy efficiency, buffer less deflection routing removes input buffers, and instead uses deflection (misrouting) to resolve contention. However, at high network load,deflections cause unnecessary network hops, wasting power and reducing performance. In this work, we propose a new NoC router design called the minimally-buffered deflection (MinBD) router. This router combines deflection routing with a small 2 ̆ 2 <b>side</b> <b>buffer,</b> 2 ̆ 2 which is much smaller than conventional input buffers. A MinBD router places some network traffic that would have otherwise been deflected in this <b>side</b> <b>buffer,</b> reducing deflections significantly. The router buffers {{only a fraction of}} traffic, thus making more efficient use of buffer space than a router that holds every flit in its input buffers. We evaluate MinBD against input-buffered routers of various sizes that implement buffer bypassing, a buffer less router, and a hybrid design, and show that MinBD is more energy efficient than all prior designs, and has performance that approaches the conventional input-buffered router with area and power close to the buffer less router...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As {{technology}} scaling {{drives the}} no. of processors upward, current on-chip routers consume substantial portions of chip area, performance, cost & power budgets. Recent work proposes to apply well-known routing technique, which eliminate buffers & hence buffers power (static & dynamic) {{at the cost}} of some misrouting or deflection called bufferless deflection routing. While bufferless NoC design has shown promising area and power reductions and offers similar performance to conventional buffered for many workloads. Such design provides lower throughput, unnecessary networkhops and wasting power at high network loads. To address this issue we propose an innovative NoC router design called Single <b>Side</b> <b>Buffered</b> Defection (SSBD) router. Compared to previous bufferless deflection router SSBD contributes (i) a router microarchitecture with a double-width ejection path and enhanced arbitration with in-router prioritization.

Flooding frequencies in Bengawan Solo River <b>Side</b> <b>Buffer</b> of Bojonegoro Regency are relatively high, about 16 flooding events in 2010. Because of the flooding, government of Bojonegoro Regency built levees for flood protection. About 1. 100 houses were built in Bengawan Solo River <b>Side</b> <b>Buffer</b> which is vulnerable to flooding every year, outside the protected area and the space between houses and the river is about 1 to 5 meters in average. The interesting part of this phenomenon is that people decide to choose their home locations outside the protected area, and this happens from generation to generation. The research questions are formulated as: (1) How is the vulnerability in the flood prone area? (2) What is the most influencing factor of the home location decision making in the flood prone areas? The method to answer the first research question was the vulnerability index and the second research question was answered with Structural Equation Model (SEM). Vulnerability analysis showed that Jetak hamlet, Klangon hamlet, LedokWetan and LedokKulon and Banjarejo hamlet are high vulnerability areas. Some factors that influenced the decision to choose home location in the flood prone areas in low vulnerability are shell, especially in the disaster evacuation path (X 22). For the medium vulnerability type, the most influence variable is society focused on law and administration (X 16). In high vulnerability, the regression model explains that the most influential parameter from the society variable is the membership and activity of the inhabitants in social organizations (X 11) ...|$|E
30|$|An {{adaptive}} layer {{switching system}} that uses {{scalable video coding}} at the server side and buffer underflow probability on the client side is very efficient for wireless networks that support on demand streaming [8]. The fullness of the client <b>side</b> <b>buffer</b> {{can be used as}} a measure of the current network condition. If the buffer is full, then it means that the network conditions are excellent and vice versa. Hence, buffer fullness can be used efficiently for dynamic and adaptive streaming systems. The video layers are “switched” based on the buffer underflow probability. Here, probability is used in order to improve the user’s quality of experience without any knowledge of the network conditions. Further, the size of playback blocks varies among different layers and priority may be assigned as per the importance of the block [13].|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{client-side}} buffer in {{the delivery}} of compressed prerecorded video can be an effective tool for removing the burstiness required of the underlying server and network by smoothing the bandwidth requirements for continuous delivery. Given a fixed-size smoothing buffer, several bandwidth smoothing algorithms have been introduced in the literature that are provably optimal under certain constraints, typically requiring large buffer residency times to realize their optimal properties. The large buffer residency times, however, make VCR functions harder to support. In this paper, we introduce the notion of time constrained bandwidth smoothing. Specifically, we introduce two new algorithms that, in addition {{to the size of the}} client <b>side</b> <b>buffer,</b> use a time constraint as a parameter in the bandwidth smoothing plan creation, making the plans more amenable to supporting VCR interactivity. Our results show that the buffer residency times can be reduced, while still allowing the bandwidth allocation to be smoothed for continuous video delivery. 1...|$|E

40|$|Dataflow {{programming}} is a promising paradigm for high performance embedded parallel computing. When mapping a dataflow program onto a manycore architecture {{a key component}} is the library to express the communication between the actors. In this paper we present a dataflow communication library supporting the CAL actor language. A first implementation of the communication library is created for Adapteva’s manycore architecture Epiphany that contains an onchip 2 -D mesh network. Three different buffering methods, with and without direct memory access (DMA) transfer, have been implemented and evaluated. We have also made a preliminary study {{on the effect of}} mapping strategies of the actors onto the cores. The assessment of the library is based on a CAL implementation of a two dimensional inverse discrete cosine transform (2 D-IDCT) and our own CAL-to-C compilation framework. As expected the results show that the most efficient actor to-core mapping strategy is to keep the communication to the nearest neighbor communication pattern as much as possible. Thus, the best way to place a pipelined sequence of computations like our 2 D-IDCT is to place the actors into cores in a serpentine fashion. For this application we found that the simple receiver <b>side</b> <b>buffer</b> outperforms the more complicated buffering strategies that used DMA transfer...|$|E
40|$|Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) and Leu-Lys-Pro (LKP) are food-derived {{antihypertensive}} peptides which inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and {{may have}} potential to attenuate hypertension. There is debate over their mechanism of uptake across small intestinal epithelia, but paracellular and PepT 1 carrier-mediated uptake {{are thought to be}} important routes. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine their routes of intestinal permeability using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo intestinal models. The presence of an apical side pH of 6. 5 (mimicking the intestinal acidic microclimate) and of Gly-Sar (a high affinity competitive inhibitor and substrate for PepT 1) were tested on the transepithelial apical to basolateral (A to B) transport of [3 H]-IPP and [3 H]-LKP across filter-grown Caco- 2 monolayers in vitro and rat jejunal mucosae ex vivo. A buffer pH of 6. 5 on the apical side enabled Gly-Sar to reduce the apparent permeability (Papp) of [3 H]-IPP and [3 H]-LKP, but this inhibition was not evident at an apical buffer pH of 7. 4. Gly-Sar reduced the Papp across isolated jejunal mucosae and the area under the curve (AUC) in intra-jejunal instillations when the apical/luminal buffer pH was either 7. 4 or 6. 5. However, the jejunal surface acidic pH was maintained in rat jejunal tissue even when the apical <b>side</b> <b>buffer</b> pH was 7. 4 due to the presence of the microclimate which is not present in monolayers. PepT 1 expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence on monolayers and brush border of rat jejunal tissue.

Very {{few people}} know, how {{important}} machine, automotive and semi-conductor industry was for functioning of Łódź in the past. Although {{there were not}} so many factories, not so many employed workers in this branches of industry as in textile one, it played vital role in everyday life of citizens {{and development of the}} city. Unfortunately, literature about this subject matter is very poor. This article, based on part of the author’s Master’s thesis, written under the supervision of Ph. D. A. Rochmińska entitled “The cultural heritage areas development of machine, automotive and semi-conductor industry in inner district of Łódź”, tries to improve the knowledge about this research problem and introduce its spatial characteristics. Author browsed number of archival materials, addresses books and former publications in order to find the most important industrial areas of those branches. He used GIS programs to verify spatial relations between objects surveyed by the way. As the result he valuated the utility of some GIS tools in this research case. Finally 155 industrial areas of cultural heritage of machine, automotive and semi-conductor industry were found and 144 of them, which were situated inside the administration boundary of Łódź in the year 1939 were inventoried and described precisely. The result of survey indicated indisputably dependence between spatial development of Łódź and number, localization of industrial areas related to machine, automotive and semi-conductor industry. Standard Deviation Ellipse analysis pointed out they were located almost proportionally both sides of the Piotrkowska Street. Though there were a little bit more research areas in West side of the Piotrkowska Street and they were less dispersed than those from its East <b>side.</b> <b>Buffer</b> map showed, that they were of very good or good communication accessibility. It was notably essential from the cultural heritage point of view, to find cadastral districts with the high percentage of machine, automotive and semi-conductor industry areas. That type of development was clearly seen in cadastral districts: W- 27 and S- 8. The former was situated in the Widzew District where Widzewska Fabryka Maszyn (Wifama) and Zakłady Hydrauliki Siłowej were located. The latter was concentrated in the downtown and that one, according to the author, deserved the special attention to. It was because the industrial buildings were very congested there, well conserved, dated between the end of nineteenth and the beginning of twentieth century with great history memories (e. g. Zakłady Mechaniczne J. John was one of ten the largest metal industry factories in Polish Kingdom in ninetennth century). The vicinity of many other significant areas of machine, automotive and semi-conductor industry (e. g. Fabryka Berschingera, Fonica, Zakłady Braci Eckstein) was also very important for that author’s statement. The areas surveyed usually were not large. Circa 76 % of them were less then 0, 5 hectare. In most of cases they were concentrated south of the Mickiewicza Street and Piłsudskiego Street. Relationship between their area and distance to the geometrical center of Łódź was positive but very weak. In the year 2009 17 % of their parcels belonged to the State Treasury, 38 % of them were of private property. Those 17 % stated 64 % of all areas related to machine, automotive and semi-conductor industry in the past in Łódź. Use of GIS tools accessible in ArcGIS 9. 3, let the author make spatial analysis much faster and more precise. Thanks to them creating thematic maps like cartograms and cartodiagrams were much simpler. They also automated process of making buffer maps or applying centrographic measures. The digital data, thematic layers with attribute data and with correct coordinate system, which were gathered for this article use, may be easily applied in future surveys on cultural heritage of Łódź industry...|$|E
