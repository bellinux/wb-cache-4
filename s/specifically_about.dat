25|$|The high {{production}} and consumption of beef cattle in the United States made the meat industry increasingly powerful {{by the end of}} the 19th century. Corruption problems soon arose in the meat industry, problems that endangered both quality and hygiene. At the beginning of the 20th century, Upton Sinclair published The Jungle, a novel about conspiracies and corruption in the American meat industry, intended as a veiled criticism of the industry itself. The book raised popular awareness about the safety of meat processing and helped lead to the creation of the Pure Food and Drug Act, which was sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration. The Jungle was a milestone in the subsequent history of the hamburger, as it led the American public to force restaurant chains to prove the safety of their cooked meat. In 1933, Arthur Kallett published a similar book, entitled 100 million guinea pigs; Dangers in Everyday foods, drugs, and cosmetics, which warned consumers <b>specifically</b> <b>about</b> the content preservatives in hamburgers.|$|E
25|$|But {{the person}} most {{responsible}} for promoting and enriching Narita-san was Ichikawa DanjÅ«rÅ I (16601704), {{one of the most}} influential actors of the golden age of kabuki. Born into a wealthy merchant family with ties to the Narita area, DanjÅ«rÅ relished his family's former samurai status by playing heroic characters doing noble deeds, developing in the process a rough, manly style known as aragoto. He was also a devout Buddhist with a particular devotion to FudÅ myÅÅ, to whom he gave credit for the safe birth of his son KuzÅ, who went on to become Ichikawa DanjÅ«rÅ II (16881758). KuzÅ played such a ferocious and convincing FudÅ in his stage debut in 1697 that the audience responded with prayers and offerings as if they were before a temple deity. In 1703, DanjÅ«rÅ I wrote and starred in another play <b>specifically</b> <b>about</b> the FudÅ at ShinshÅ-ji, The Avatars of the FudÅ of Narita Temple, whose opening was timed to coincide with the traveling exhibit (åº degaichÅ) of sacred images from Narita-san in Edo. DanjÅ«rÅ's immense popularity and his attachment to FudÅ myÅÅ at ShinshÅ-ji prompted many commoners of all classes to make regular pilgrimages from Edo to Narita-san.|$|E
