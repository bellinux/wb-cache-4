5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} and the periventricular {{nucleus of the}} {{hypothalamus}} have dopamine neurons that form an important projection—the tuberoinfundibular pathway which goes to the pituitary gland, where it influences the <b>secretion</b> of the hormone prolactin. Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the <b>secretion</b> of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. Dopamine produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the pituitary gland. The prolactin cells that produce prolactin, {{in the absence of}} dopamine, secrete prolactin continuously; dopamine inhibits this <b>secretion.</b> In the context of regulating prolactin <b>secretion,</b> dopamine is occasionally called prolactin-inhibiting factor, prolactin-inhibiting hormone, or prolactostatin.|$|E

Methods: The comparative bioavailability of mupirocin and chlorhexidine in nasal <b>secretions</b> was determined by bioassay after one, four, and eight hours of incubation with pooled <b>secretions</b> from three subjects. The interaction of mupirocin with nasal <b>secretions</b> was characterised by matrix assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF).

However, these insects were absent in nest boxes both with and without <b>secretions</b> from nestlings’ uropygial glands. We subsequently tested for the effects of uropygial gland <b>secretions</b> from feral pigeons Columba livia monitoring the number of biting midges captured using miniature CDC traps. There {{was no significant difference in}} the number of biting midges captured.

5|$|The pygmy slow loris {{produces}} an apocrine <b>secretion</b> on scent glands near their elbow (brachial glands). This clear liquid, when mixed with its saliva, creates a volatile, noxious toxin. When startled, the slow loris licks its brachial glands and applies the <b>secretion</b> to its heads. The oily <b>secretion</b> contains a complex mixture of volatile and semi-volatile components; one chemical analysis indicated over 200 components were present. One {{of the components}} {{is a member of}} the secretoglobin family of proteins, and similar to an allergenic protein found in cat dander. The similarity between the brachial gland secretions and domestic cat allergens may account for anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Secretions</b> {{are seen}} {{in a range of}} breast cancer that {{includes}} invasive ductal carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma and secretory carcinoma. Evaluation of the quantity and location of <b>secretions</b> and the contours of the cell clusters complement cell morphology could improve diagnostic cytopathological criteria. Aim: To identify the range of breast carcinomas with <b>secretions</b> on fine-needle aspiration. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of 160 patients with breast carcinoma was carried out. The tumors were typed by evaluating the quantity and location of <b>secretions,</b> cellularity and nuclear grade. Results: <b>Secretions</b> were seen in 16 of 160 breast carcinomas. Eleven were invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), three were mucinous and two were secretory carcinomas. In IDC, minimal intracytoplasmic <b>secretions</b> were seen in 10, nuclear grades of 2 and 3 in 9, cell clusters with irregular margins in 6, and necrosis in 4. All mucinous and secretory carcinomas were nuclear grade 1. Extensive extracellular <b>secretions</b> and cell clusters with rounded contours were seen in mucinous carcinomas. In secretory carcinomas, the <b>secretions</b> were predominantly intracellular; stringy vasculature was a unique feature. Conclusion: <b>Secretions</b> in breast cancer {{are seen in}} a range of lesions that include IDC, mucinous, and secretory carcinomas.

5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and <b>secretion</b> remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased <b>secretion</b> of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF <b>secretion,</b> with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing <b>secretion</b> and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E
50|$|Guaifenesin {{is thought}} {{to act as an}} {{expectorant}} by increasing the volume and reducing the viscosity of <b>secretions</b> in the trachea and bronchi.

Thus, it may increase the efficiency of the cough reflex and facilitate removal of the <b>secretions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{sympathetic}} {{nervous system}} regulates submandibular <b>secretions</b> through vasoconstriction of the arteries that supply it. Increased sympathetic activity reduces glandular bloodflow, thereby decreasing the volume of fluid in salivary <b>secretions,</b> producing an enzyme rich mucous saliva. Nevertheless, direct stimulation of sympathetic nerves will cause an increase in salivary enzymatic <b>secretions.</b> In sum, the volume decreases, but the <b>secretions</b> are increased by parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation.|$|R

The cell <b>secretions</b> from different lamprey tissues were separated, and these <b>secretions</b> killed human tumor cells to varying degrees. The cell <b>secretions</b> induced remarkable cell morphological alterations such as cell blebbing, and the plasma membrane was destroyed by the <b>secretions.</b> In addition, the <b>secretions</b> induced morphological alterations of the mitochondria, cytoskeletal structure, and endoplasmic reticulum, eventually leading to cell death. These observations suggest the presence of a novel protein in the lamprey and the possibility of new applications for the protein in the medical field.|$|R
5|$|The {{success of}} any {{pathogen}} {{depends on its}} ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II <b>secretion</b> system. Alternatively, using a type III <b>secretion</b> system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.|$|E

40|$|Competition for carrion can be intense, {{including}} between {{animals and}} microbes, which {{rely heavily on}} the availability of these resources for survival and reproduction. Burying beetles use a small vertebrate carcass for reproduction and offspring development and prevent carcass decomposition by continuously covering it with oral and anal <b>secretions.</b> A common competitor for vertebrate carcasses was found to be fungi, leading us to predict that oral and anal <b>secretions</b> of the burying beetle Nicrophorous orbicollis would have anti-fungal properties. The zone of inhibition assays showed that oral and anal <b>secretions</b> inhibited the growth of fungi and filter sterilization of these <b>secretions</b> resulted in no anti-fungal activity confirming the role of bacteria as an anti-fungal agent in the <b>secretions.</b> The anti-fungal properties of oral and anal <b>secretions</b> could be attributed to the presence of Gram negative bacteria Enterobacter aerogenes.

25|$|Osteoblasts {{can also}} be stimulated to {{increase}} bone mass through increased <b>secretion</b> of osteoid and by inhibiting the ability of osteoclasts to break down osseous tissue. Increased <b>secretion</b> of osteoid is stimulated by the <b>secretion</b> of growth hormone by the pituitary, thyroid hormone and the sex hormones (estrogens and androgens). These hormones also promote increased <b>secretion</b> of osteoprotegerin. Osteoblasts {{can also be}} induced to secrete a number of cytokines that promote reabsorbtion of bone by stimulating osteoclast activity and differentiation from progenitor cells. Vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and stimulation from osteocytes induce osteoblasts to increase <b>secretion</b> of RANK-ligand and interleukin 6, which cytokines then stimulate increased reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts. These same compounds also increase <b>secretion</b> of macrophage colony-stimulating factor by osteoblasts, which promotes the differentiation of progenitor cells into osteoclasts, and decrease <b>secretion</b> of osteoprotegerin.|$|E
