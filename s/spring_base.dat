500|$|Piano Concerto No. 2 was {{directed}} by Butoy with art director Michael Humphries. It originated in the 1930s when Walt Disney wished to adapt a collection of Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales into an animated film. The artists completed a series of preliminary designs based on the stories, including ones for The Steadfast Tin Soldier from 1938 by Bianca Majolie that were stored in the studio's animation research library and used for a 1991 Disney book that retold the story accompanied with the storyboard sketches. When Disney suggested using the Shostakovich piece, Butoy flipped through the book and found the story's structure fit to the music. When Humphries saw the sketches he designed the segment with works by Caravaggio and Rembrandt in mind to give the segment a [...] "timeless" [...] feel, while keeping the colors [...] "as romantic as possible" [...] during the scenes when the soldier and ballerina are first getting acquainted. Live action footage of a real ballerina {{was used as a}} guide for the toy ballerina's movements. Butoy found the Jack-in-a-box a difficult character to design and animate with its <b>spring</b> <b>base</b> and how he moved with the box.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 93 - 94. The elastohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} of polymeric piston {{seals in}} a water powered rockdrill has been modelled in this thesis. Current seal designs, consist of an Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) ring, energised to remain {{in contact with the}} reciprocating piston, using a nitrile rubber o-ring. The design of the seals is such that they do not facilitate the formation of a lubricating film, and the high contact stresses at the seal face due to the seal pressure cause excessive wear of the seals. The elastohydrodynamic model is based on a numerical algorithm in which the elasticity equations for the seal deflection and the one dimensional lubrication equation have been solved simultaneously. The polymeric ring has been simplified due to its axisymmetry, and modelled in cross section as an elastic beam resting on a <b>spring</b> <b>base,</b> while the deformation of the o-ring has been considered independently since the moduli of the two materials differs by nearly two orders of magnitude. The o-ring was modelled using the non-linear Mooney-Rivlin constitutive equation implemented in the finite element code ABAQUS. With this model, the contact stresses existing between the o-ring and the back of the polymer seal have been determined for a range of o-ring squeezes and rubber hardnesses. The resultant lubrication and o-ring forces acting on the rectangular polymer seal have been used in a finite difference formulation of the seal (or beam on a <b>spring</b> <b>base)</b> to determine the seal deflection above the piston...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Symmetric ankle {{propulsion}} is {{the cornerstone}} of efficient human walking. The ankle plantar flexors provide the majority of the mechanical work for the step-to-step transition and much of this work is delivered via elastic recoil from the Achilles ’ tendon- making it highly efficient. Even though the plantar flexors {{play a central role in}} propulsion, body-weight support and swing initiation during walking, very few assistive devices have focused on aiding ankle plantarflexion. Our goal was to develop a portable ankle exoskeleton taking inspiration from the passive elastic mechanisms at play in the human triceps surae-Achilles ’ tendon complex during walking. The challenge was to use parallel springs to provide ankle joint mechanical assistance during stance phase but allow free ankle rotation during swing phase. To do this we developed a novel ‘smartclutch’ that can engage and disengage a parallel <b>spring</b> <b>base...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Groundwater is an {{essential}} part of the hydrological cycle. It is characterized by its long turnover time, ubiquity and small variability. Flow and chemical characteristics and properties have to be considered in a three dimensional framework. Groundwater stable flow and definite chemical character play a key role in geological and biological processes and thus has significant environmental implications in maintaining river and <b>spring</b> <b>base</b> flow, wetlands, phreatophyte communities, gallery forest, [...] ., and also is {{an essential}} feature in favour of its development. Groundwater development implies a change in the flow pattern which may result in water table lowering, decrease of outflow and chemical changes, moveover land subsidence in some cases. All this modifies environmental conditions, which leads to water flow decrease, reduction of phreatophyte surface area, wetland desiccation and biological modifications related to chemical changes. But these changes appear with a long delay and at a slow pace. Thus the cause-effect relationships are not always evident. Negative impacts have to be compared with the benefits derived from development and with the impacts of other alternatives. This includes the consideration and the cost of possible correction of the long delayed negative effects. Aquifer salinization and contamination is an important environmental issue that has to be taken into account since groundwater will be soon or later discharged into the environment, carrying with it the contaminants or their transformation products, in a complex way...|$|E

40|$|Karst {{aquifers}} {{are uniquely}} vulnerable to contamination. In the Barton Springs {{segment of the}} karstic Edwards aquifer (Texas, U. S. A.), urban contaminants such as pesticides and volatile organic compounds frequently are detected in <b>spring</b> <b>base</b> flow. To determine whether contaminant concentrations change in response to storms, and if they therefore might act as tracers of focused recharge, samples were collected from Barton Springs at closely spaced intervals following three storms. Two herbicides (atrazine and simazine), two insecticides (carbaryl and diazinon), and a solvent (tetrachloroethene) described breakthrough curves over a 1 -week period following one or more storms. The breakthrough curves were decomposed into two to five log-normal subcurves, which were interpreted as representing pulses of contaminants moving through the aquifer. Each subcurve {{could be used in}} the same way as an artificial tracer to determine travel time to and recovery at the spring. The contaminants have several advantages over artificial tracers: they represent the actual compounds of interest, they are injected essentially simultaneously at several points, and they are injected under those conditions when transport is of the most interest, i. e., following storms. The response of storm discharge, specific conductance, and contaminant loading at the spring depended on initial aquifer flow conditions, which varied from very low (spring discharge of 0. 48 m 3 /s) to high (spring discharge of 2. 7 m 3 /s) : concentrations and recovery were the highest when initial aquifer flow conditions were low. This behavior provides information about aquifer structure and the influence of aquifer flow condition on transport properties...|$|E
