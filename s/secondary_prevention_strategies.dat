50|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>strategies</b> involve {{students}} (i.e., 10-15% of {{the school}} population) who {{do not respond to}} the primary prevention strategies and are at risk for academic failure or behavior problems but are not in need of individual support (Nelson, et al., 2002). Interventions at the secondary level often are delivered in small groups to maximize time and effort and should be developed with the unique needs of the students within the group. Examples of these interventions include social support such as social skills training (e.g., explicit instruction in skill-deficit areas, friendship clubs, check in/check out, role playing) or academic support (i.e., use of research-validated intervention programs and tutoring). Additionally, secondary programs could include behavioral support approaches (e.g., simple Functional Behavioral Assessments FBA, precorrection, self-management training). Even with the heightened support within secondary level interventions, some students (1-7%) will need the additional assistance at the tertiary level (Walker et al., 1996).|$|E

It forms {{part of a new}} prevention paradigm for psychiatry and is leading to reform of mental health services, especially in the United Kingdom [...] and Australia. This approach centers on the early detection and treatment of early symptoms of psychosis during the formative years of the psychotic condition. The first three to five years are believed by some to be a critical period. The aim is to reduce the usual delays to treatment for those in their first episode of psychosis.

40|$|The {{only reason}} P 2 Y 12 inhibitors are {{administered}} inaddition to aspirin {{is to improve}} the prevention of thrombosis. The clinical efficacy of adding clopidogrel to aspirin as a <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>strategy</b> in patients with high-risk coronary artery disease is well established. 1 There are no effects of clopidogrel on any receptor other than P 2 Y 12 to explain the magnitude of the clinical benefit. All of the established clinical effects are attributed to reduced platelet responsiveness to ADP. 2 Therefore, the patient with inade-quate P 2 Y 12 inhibition determined by ex vivo testing logi-cally has an increased risk for thrombosis. Persistent ischemic event occurrence and the irrefutable demonstration of clopi-dogrel antiplatelet response variability are 2 potent arguments against the widely practiced nonselective or one-size-fits-all strategy of administering clopidogrel therapy.

40|$|Objective: Although regular {{physical}} activity is an effective <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>strategy</b> for patients with a chronic disease, {{it is unclear whether}} patients change their daily physical activity after being diagnosed. Therefore, the aims of this study were to (1) describe changes in levels of physical activity in middle-aged women before and after diagnosis with a chronic disease (heart disease, diabetes, asthma, breast cancer, arthritis, depression); and to (2) examine whether diagnosis with a chronic disease affects levels of physical activity in these women. Methods: Data from 5 surveys (1998 - 2010) of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health (ALSWH) were used. Participants (N = 4840, born 1946 - 1951) completed surveys every three years, with questions about diseases and leisure time physical activity.

40|$|Introduction: Coronary {{heart disease}} (CHD) {{is a common}} and {{potentially}} fatal disease with a life time prevalence as high as about 20 %. The development of CHD is multicausal and related {{to a variety of}} risk factors strongly influenced by individual life style. These risk factors in turn strongly affect the prognosis of patients with already established CHD. It is the goal of non-pharmacological <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>strategies</b> to positively influence these risk factors and to thereby treat CHD causally. Numerous studies investigating the effectiveness of those strategies already exist. A systematic analysis summarizing the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of the major non-pharmacological <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>strategies,</b> however, has been missing so far. It is both the aim of this work to summarize the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of non-pharmacological <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>strategies</b> and to investigate the comparative effectiveness of interventions of different categories, specific intervention components, and the effectiveness in relation to patient characteristics. Methods: A structured search of databases and a manual search of reference lists were conducted. 26 databases were searched. Clinical trials and meta-analyses published between January 2003 and September 2009 were included if they reported mortality, cardiac events or quality of life (Qol). Each was assessed independently by two researchers. Where appropriate, pooled effect estimates were calculated using RevMan 5. 0 software. Results: Of 5450 publications, 51 met the inclusion criteria. Overall, study quality was satisfactory. The follow-up duration varied between 12 and 120 months. Despite substantial heterogeneity, there was strong evidence for intervention effectiveness. The evidence for exercise and multimodal interventions was more conclusive for a reduction in mortality, while psychosocial interventions seemed to be more effective in improving Qol. Discussion: Non-pharmacological secondary prevention proved to be an effective tool, with exercise and multimodal interventions reducing mortality most substantially. There is a lack of studies concerning dietary and smoking cessation interventions. Also, intervention effectiveness in important patient subgroups and of specific intervention components could not be evaluated conclusively. Future research should, amongst others, attempt to investigate these issues in methodologically rigorous randomised-controlled trials with an appropriate length of follow-up...|$|E

40|$|A {{cultural}} competence view of cardiac rehabilitation Aims and objectives: This paper describes {{cultural competence}} issues within {{the scientific and}} scholarly discourse surrounding cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Background: CR is an important <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>strategy,</b> improving health-related outcomes and reducing the risks of subsequent cardiovascular events. Internationally, it is widely accepted as a discrete health service model and is endorsed by government and professional bodies. Over past decades, low participation rates in CR remain a concern, particularly among minority groups and culturally and linguistically diverse populations. Conclusions: Few studies to date have described cultural competence in CR service design and as a consequence, there are minimal data to assist CR professionals and policy makers in tailoring health service delivery models. The limited scholarly debate and discussion regarding cultural competence in the CR literature limits the development and evaluation of culturally appropriate interventions. Implications for clinical practice: There {{needs to be a}} greater attention to the concept of cultural competence, both in practice and research settings, to ensure access to CR for people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds...|$|R

40|$|Background: With {{the rise}} in the ageing {{population}} and absence of a cure for dementia, cost-effective <b>prevention</b> <b>strategies</b> for those 'at risk' of dementia including those with depression and/or mild cognitive impairment are urgently required. Objective: This study evaluated the efficacy of a multifaceted Healthy Brain Ageing Cognitive Training (HBA-CT) program for older adults 'at risk' of dementia. Methods: Using a single-blinded design, 64 participants (mean age = 66. 5 years, SD = 8. 6) were randomized to an immediate treatment (HBA-CT) or treatment-as-usual control arm. The HBA-CT intervention was conducted twice-weekly for seven weeks and comprised group-based psychoeducation about cognitive strategies and modifiable lifestyle factors pertaining to healthy brain ageing, and computerized cognitive training. Results: In comparison to the treatment-as-usual control arm, the HBA-CT program was associated with improvements in verbal memory (p = 0. 03), self-reported memory (p = 0. 03), mood (p = 0. 01), and sleep (p = 0. 01). While the improvements in memory (p = 0. 03) and sleep (p = 0. 02) remained after controlling for improvements in mood, only a trend in verbal memory improvement was apparent after controlling for sleep. Conclusion: The HBA-CT program improves cognitive, mood, and sleep functions in older adults 'at risk' of dementia, and therefore offers promise as a <b>secondary</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>strategy.</b> © 2015 IOS Press and the authors.

40|$|Objectives: To report {{baseline}} {{mental health}} measures from the Children in Care study, a prospective epidemiological study {{of children in}} court-ordered foster and kinship care in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: Mental health, socialization and self-esteem were assessed in 347 children in a statewide mail survey, using two carer-report checklists, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Assessment Checklist for Children (ACC). Results: Children in the study had exceptionally poor mental health and socialization, both in absolute terms, and relative to normative and in-care samples. Levels and rates of disturbance for {{children in foster care}} exceeded all prior estimates. Rates of disturbance for children in kinship care were high, but within the range of prior estimates. Boys presented with higher scope and severity of mental health problems than girls on the CBCL, while gender-specific patterns of disturbance were shown on the ACC. A moderate age effect was accounted for by children's age at entry into care. Conclusions: Children in care are at high risk of mental health problems.

40|$|Background. Evidences are accumulating {{that age}} and gender have great impact on the {{distribution}} of stroke risk factors. Such data are lacking in Chinese population. Methods. 1027 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke (IS) were recruited and divided into young adult (80 years) groups according to stroke onset ages. Vascular risk factors were collected and compared among groups. Results. Female patients were globally older than male patients at stroke onset and having higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM), heart diseases, and atrial fibrillation (AF). However, females were less likely to drink heavily or smoke than males. Young patients had a much higher proportion of smoking and drinking than middle-aged and very old patients and the highest family history of hypertension, while very old patients had the highest prevalence of heart diseases and AF but lowest proportion of positive family history of vascular diseases.

METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to hospital after traumatic injury (n= 155) were assessed for current psychiatric disorder, pain, and morphine dose in the initial week after injury and were reassessed for PTSD and other psychiatric disorders 3 months later (n= 120). RESULTS: Seventeen patients (14 %) met criteria for PTSD at 3 months. Patients who met criteria for PTSD received significantly less morphine {{than those who did not}} develop PTSD; there was no difference in morphine levels in those who did and did not develop major depressive episode or another anxiety disorder. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that PTSD severity at 3 months was significantly predicted by acute pain, mild traumatic brain injury, and elevated morphine dose in the initial 48 hours after trauma, after controlling for injury severity, gender, age, and type of injury.
