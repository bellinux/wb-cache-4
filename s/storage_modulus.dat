The presence of {{low molecular weight}} LC molecules in the polymer matrix modifies dramatically the dynamic and static mechanical behavior of the obtained composite materials. Above the glass transition temperature Tg (LC), dilution of the initial mixture with a low molecular weight LC like E 7 leads to a significant weakening of the film mechanical strength.

40|$|AbstractA phenomenological {{uniaxial}} {{model is}} derived for implementation {{in the time}} domain, which captures the amplitude and frequency dependency of filled elastomers. Motivated by the experimental observation that the frequency dependency is stronger for smaller strain amplitudes than for large ones, a novel material model is presented. It utilizes a split of deformation between a generalized Maxwell chain in series with a bounding surface plasticity model with a vanishing elastic region. Many attempts to capture the behaviour of filled elastomers {{are found in the}} literature, which often utilize an additive split between an elastic and a history dependent element, in parallel. Even though some models capture the <b>storage</b> and loss <b>modulus</b> during sinusoidal excitations, they often fail to do so for more complex load histories. Simulations with the derived model are compared to measurements in simple shear on a compound of carbon black filled natural rubber used in driveline isolators in the heavy truck industry. The <b>storage</b> and loss <b>modulus</b> from simulations agree very well with measurements, using only 7 material parameters to capture 2 decades of strain (0. 5 – 50 % shear strain) and frequency (0. 2 – 20 Hz). More importantly, with material parameters extracted from the measured <b>storage</b> and loss <b>modulus,</b> measurements of a dual sine excitation are well replicated. This enables realistic operating conditions to be simulated early in the development process, before an actual prototype is available for testing, since the loads in real life operating conditions frequently are a combination of many harmonics...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The materials made available through the LDEF satellite provide a set of specimens that can be well characterized and have a known exposure history with reference to atomic oxygen and ultraviolet radiation exposure. Mechanical characteristics measured from control samples and exposed samples provide a data base for predicting the behaviour of polymers in low earth orbit. Samples of 1. 0 mil thick low density polyethylene were exposed to the low earth orbit environment for a period of six years. The viscoelastic characteristics of these materials were measured and compared to the viscoelastic characteristics of control samples.
