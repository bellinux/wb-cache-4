50|$|A <b>split</b> <b>edit,</b> is a {{transition}} from one shot to another in film or video, where transition of the audio and video happen at different times. This is often done to enhance the aesthetics or flow of the film, allowing the audience to see context—either before or after—of speaking rather than simply the speaking itself. Without <b>split</b> <b>edit,</b> a conversation between two people can feel like a tennis match.|$|R
50|$|With {{proliferation}} of computer-based non-linear editing different variants of <b>split</b> <b>edit</b> received their own names {{based on how}} the video being edited is presented on the timeline. A variant of <b>split</b> <b>edit</b> when the audio from preceding scene overlaps the video from the following scene is known as L cut. If the audio from the following scene overlaps the video from the preceding scene, then this cut is known as J cut.|$|R
5000|$|Emacs can <b>split</b> the <b>editing</b> <b>area</b> into {{separate}} sections called [...] "windows," [...] {{a feature that}} has been available since 1975, predating the graphical user interface in common use. In Emacs terminology, [...] "Windows" [...] are similar to what other systems call [...] "frames" [...] or [...] "panes" [...] - a rectangular portion of the program's display that can be updated and interacted with independently. Each Emacs window has a status bar called the [...] "mode line" [...] displayed by default at the bottom edge of the window. Emacs windows are available both in text-terminal and graphical modes and allow more than one buffer, or several parts of a buffer, to be displayed at once. Common applications are to display a dired buffer along with the contents of files in the current directory (there are special modes to make the file buffer follow the file highlighted in dired), to display the source code of a program in one window while another displays a shell buffer {{with the results of}} compiling the program, to run a debugger along with a shell buffer running the program, to work on code while displaying a man page or other documentation (possibly loaded over the World Wide Web using one of Emacs' built-in web browsers) or simply to display multiple files for editing at once such as a header along with its implementation file for C-based languages. In addition, there is follow-mode, a minor mode that chains windows to display non-overlapping portions of a buffer. Using follow-mode, a single file can be displayed in multiple side-by-side windows that update appropriately when scrolled. Emacs windows are tiled and cannot appear [...] "above" [...] or [...] "below" [...] their companions. Emacs can launch multiple [...] "frames", which are displayed as individual windows in a graphical environment. On a text terminal, multiple frames are displayed stacked filling the entire terminal, and can be switched using the standard Emacs commands.|$|R

50|$|<b>Split</b> <b>edits</b> {{are also}} used to hide {{transitions}} between scenes. They can be very effective in editing dialog scenes shot with a single camera using multiple takes. The ability to cut the picture/video separately from the sound/audio allows the sound from the various takes to flow smoothly, even though the picture cuts are at different places. In longer shots, this allows the editor to use the picture from one take with the sound from another take if the dialog reading is better.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to multiresolution editing of a triangular mesh. The basic idea is to embed an <b>editing</b> <b>area</b> of a mesh onto a 2 D rectangle and interpolate the user-specified editing information over the 2 D rectangle. The result of the interpolation is mapped back to the <b>editing</b> <b>area</b> and then used to update the mesh. We adopt harmonic maps for the embedding and multilevel B-splines for the interpolation. The proposed mesh editing technique can handle an arbitrary mesh without any preprocessing such as remeshing. It runs fast enough to support interactive editing and produces intuitive editing results. 1. Introduction In computer graphics, triangular meshes are widely used in representing shapes. Mesh editing allows a user to control {{the shape of a}} mesh by adjusting the vertex positions of the mesh. It is a powerful tool for generating a desired shape from a given mesh. However, if a user can edit only one vertex at a time, it would be tedious and time consumin [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Given an {{undirected graph}} G and a {{positive}} integer k, the NP-hard Sparse <b>Split</b> Graph <b>Editing</b> problem asks to transform G into a graph that consists of a clique plus isolated vertices by performing at most k edge insertions and deletions; similarly, the P 3 -Bag Editing problem asks to transform G into a graph which is the union of two possibly overlapping cliques. We give a simple linear-time 3 -approximation algorithm for Sparse <b>Split</b> Graph <b>Editing,</b> an improvement over a more involved known factor- 3. 525 approximation. Further, we show that P 3 -Bag Editing is NP-complete. Finally, we present a kernelization scheme for both problems and additionally for the 2 -Cluster Editing problem. This scheme produces for each fixed ε in polynomial time a kernel of order εk. This is, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, the first example of a kernelization scheme that converges to a known lower bound. ...|$|R

To preserve T-Groups in operational transformation new algorithms are developed based on the REDUCE approach, and some explanations of the correctness of the proposed algorithms are also given in this paper. At last, two examples are demonstrated to show how the algorithms work, and some further discussions about other types of operation groups such as S-Group and ST-Group are presented either...|$|R
