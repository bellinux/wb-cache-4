From then on, Muhammad Jinnah would receive {{personal}} care {{and support from}} her as he aged and began to suffer from the lung ailments which would kill him.

Jinnah later became estranged from Dina after she decided to marry a Christian, Neville Wadia from a prominent Parsi business family. When Jinnah urged Dina to marry a Muslim, <b>she</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> that he had married a woman not raised in his faith. Jinnah continued to correspond cordially with his daughter, but their personal relationship was strained, {{and she did not}} come to Pakistan in his lifetime, but only for his funeral.|$|E

In early 1617, Smith met the couple at a social gathering, and later wrote that when Pocahontas saw him, [...] "without any words, she turned about, {{obscured}} her face, as not seeming well contented", and was left alone for two or three hours. Later, they spoke more; Smith's record of what she said to him is fragmentary and enigmatic. <b>She</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> of the [...] "courtesies she had done", saying, [...] "you did promise Powhatan what was yours would be his, and he the like to you". She then discomfited him by calling him [...] "father", explaining Smith had called Powhatan [...] "father" [...] when a stranger in Virginia, [...] "and by the same reason so must I do you".
