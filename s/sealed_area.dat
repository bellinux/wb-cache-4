50|$|The {{elliptic}} chamber {{is called}} a 'cam ring' by the industry. As a vane moves into, say, a maximum extension, and then rotates into a minimum extension region of the cam ring, it passes through a gradual transition from maximum to minimum followed by a gradual transitionback to maximum and this happens twice per revolution. In order to prevent oil under pressure from bypassing the vanes, 4 sealing areasare created by means of 4 kidney shaped ports located in the transition areas between minimum and maximum. The spaces between the kidney ports are called the <b>sealing</b> <b>areas</b> and this port system is located at either, or both axial ends of the rotor and vanes. The configuration of the ports and <b>sealing</b> <b>areas</b> are such that the space between any two adjacent vanes is slightly less than the coverage ofthe <b>sealing</b> <b>area.</b> In other words, as the vanes rotate through the <b>sealing</b> <b>area,</b> for {{a small amount of}} rotation, both adjacent vanes arewithin the <b>sealing</b> <b>area.</b> As the rotation continues, the first vane in line leaves the <b>sealing</b> <b>area,</b> but not before the next vane in succession is firmly in the sealing region.|$|R

This may help to derive implications for urban planning in order to promote and maintain high diversity and ecosystem function in an increasing urbanized environment. The structure of wintering bird communities of 36 Vienna city parks – surveyed once a month in January 2009, December 2009, December 2012, and January 2013 – was described by species richness and the functional diversity measurements FRic (functional richness), FEve (functional evenness), and FDiv (functional divergence).

40|$|A fatal {{explosion}} in a <b>sealed</b> <b>area</b> at the Sago Mine in 2006 prompted researchers and regulators in the United States to re-examine {{the requirements for}} explosion-resistant mine seals. Seals are used in underground coal mines to isolate abandoned mining areas from active workings. Prior to the Sago disaster, mining regulations required seals to withstand a 140 kPa explosion pressure. Recent research at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Laboratory showed that pressures from explosions can far exceed this pressure. U. S. mining regulations now require much stronger seals. Current research focuses on understanding the science, engineering and management of sealed areas of coal mines. Scientific efforts seek understanding of how explosive methane-air mixtures accumulate using measurements and models of the <b>sealed</b> <b>area</b> atmosphere. Additional scientific efforts aim to understand the explosion pressures that can develop {{using a combination of}} numerical modeling and experiments. Engineering efforts aim to produce design guidelines for seals that can resist the new higher pressure design criteria.

40|$|Abstract: The onset and {{development}} of cavitation in the annular needle seat passage of piezo-driven outward-opening pintle injector nozzles used with spray-guided direct-injection gasoline engines are studied using a Eulerian–Lagrangian computational fluid dynamics cavitation model. Cavitation is formed because of the fluid acceleration taking place at the needle <b>sealing</b> <b>area</b> {{and it has been}} found to be affected by its geometric details. Various submodels for nucleation and bubble formation, further bubble growth and collapse, as well as bubble break-up and transport are incorporated into the model. Qualitative model validation is performed against experimental data reported elsewhere in large-scale nozzle replicas, showing similar cavitation patterns to be formed. These consist of vapour pockets rather than a con-tinuous vapour film and develop transiently in a rather chaotic manner around the circumfer-ential needle <b>sealing</b> <b>area,</b> even under stationary geometry and fixed-flowrate conditions. Further transient effects associated with the fast opening and closing of the piezo-controlled needle valve are also presented...|$|R

40|$|Seals, {{which are}} used in {{underground}} coal mines throughout the U. S. to isolate abandoned mining areas from the active workings, were required to withstand a 140 -kPa (20 -psig) explosion pressure under mining regulations prior to the Sago Mine disaster in 2006. The failure of seals at Sago prompted sweeping regulatory changes that were initiated {{with the passage of}} the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act (MINER act), which required MSHA to increase the seal design standard by the end of 2007. Based on sound scientific and engineering justification, NIOSH researchers developed explosion pressure design criteria for new seal designs and for monitoring the atmosphere behind seals to protect miners from blast effects and toxic gases produced by contained explosions. This information was published in July 2007. In 2008, MSHA issued the final rule for mine seals based, in part, on the information contained in this NIOSH report. The final rule states that seals must withstand 345 kPa (50 psig) if the <b>sealed</b> <b>area</b> atmosphere is monitored and maintained inert, 828 kPa (120 psig) if the <b>sealed</b> <b>area</b> atmosphere is not monitored, and greater than 828 kPa (120 psig) if the <b>sealed</b> <b>area</b> atmosphere is not monitored and certain conditions exist that might lead to higher explosion pressures. From 2001 to 2007, the NIOSH Office of Mine Safety and Health Research conducted studies to develop alternative ways to determine the adequacy of coal mine seals. The researchers compared full-scale explosion testing within the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine to full-scale hydrostatic testing within a chamber using water to load seals to pressure. Researchers found that gradually applying water pressure to twice the expected explosion pressure was equivalent to the effects created by the rapid increase in pressure loading that results from confined explosions. These hydrostatic tests provided stress-strain measurements, determined the ultimate strength of seals, and demonstrated that hydrostatic testing of mine seals was a timely and cost-effective alternative to full-scale explosion testing. Results of these studies should be used with the testing of mine ventilation seals. NIOSH Recommendations: 1. Use hydrostatic testing of mine seals in place of or in conjunction with full-scale explosion testing as a means to validate engineering calculations and models. 2. Use empirical resistance data from the hydrostatic testing to improve or validate design codes. These new data should be considered when using or evaluating design codes. 3. Test seals under static load at least twice the explosion design pressure when performing hydrostatic tests. 4. Conduct additional studies to further refine and quantify the response. 5. Utilize only design codes validated by testing for mine seal design. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "October 2010. "On back: Logo for the Research to Practice at NIOSH initiative (r 2 p).
