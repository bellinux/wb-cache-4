50|$|A {{spark gap}} {{is one of}} the oldest {{protective}} electrical technologies still found in telephone circuits, having been developed in the nineteenth century.

Carbon block suppressors are similar to gas arrestors (GDTs) but with the two electrodes exposed to the air, so their behavior is affected by the surrounding atmosphere, especially the humidity. Since their operation produces an open spark, these devices should never be installed where an explosive atmosphere may develop.|$|E
50|$|Protection of {{traction}} motors from short circuits {{is accomplished by}} means of a fast-acting circuit breaker, which disconnects the traction circuit within 2-5 milliseconds if the current exceeds 575±25 amps. In case of a <b>short</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> where the current does not exceed this level, protection is accomplished by a differential relay which compares current {{at both ends of the}} circuit and opens the circuit breaker if the difference in current exceeds 40 amps. The {{traction motors}} are also protected by a wheelslip relay which trips if the angular velocity of one of the traction motors significantly differs from the others (wheelslip, skidding, stripped gears, etc.) and an overload relay which trips if the current in a traction motor's circuit exceeds 265 amps; tripping of these relays automatically reduces the train's acceleration. The engineer's instrument panel has warning lights which illuminate when any of these relays trip (except for the differential relay—its action can be deduced from certain peculiarities in the tripping of the circuit breaker), and the tripping of the wheelslip relay also activates a warning bell.|$|E

30|$|Protection misoperations {{in power}} systems are a top {{reliability}} concern {{according to a}} recent state of reliability report of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) [1]. Protection misoperations fall into two broad categories: failures to trip and false trips, where trip means the removal of a piece of supposedly faulty equipment from the system by opening some circuit breakers. Equipment faults considered in this paper are three-phase <b>short</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> faults in transmission lines. The principles established, however, are applicable to other types of transmission line faults and faults in other types of equipment. A typical protection system is designed to be dependable (to trip whenever it should) at the expense of security (not to trip whenever it should not) [2]. False trips occur much more often than failures to trip in a stressed system [1]. False trips are sometimes referred to as hidden failures. A hidden failure is a permanent defect causing the incorrect removal of a circuit element as a direct consequence of another triggering event [3]. A system can become stressed when it is subject to an equipment fault, a switch, a change in load/generation power, or a severe event of nature.|$|E

Simulated sample paths on the three generators’ terminal voltage and current waveforms, rotor angles, and angular speed deviations are displayed that contain consecutive durations at normal, fault-on, protection false trip, and post-fault operations. The system starts with a normal operation. A mid-point <b>short</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> fault in line 5 - 7 occurs at 0.3 s. into the simulation. Line 7 - 8 is falsely removed at 0.4 s., which renders the system enter insecure state m. The fault is cleared at 0.5 s. by reconnecting line 7 - 8 and removing line 5 - 7. The recovered system enters and stays at state d (post-fault) from 0.5 s. {{till the end of}} the simulation. The electro-mechanical states of the three generators are estimated based on the measurement model in (13). The estimates are obtained using the local PMU-like sensor input waveforms at 24 samples/cycle at the high side terminals of the step up transformer of a generator. The estimation algorithm does not involve any swing dynamics.|$|E

40|$|OAK-B 135 Recent {{calibration}} {{shots in}} which full toroidal field (TF) coil current interacted with the maximum poloidal field coils have produced increased lateral loads {{on the outer}} sections of the TF-coil. The increased lateral loads have resulted in deflections that have been sufficient to cause the TF-coil to contact adjacent equipment and produce a transient <b>short</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> within the coil. The six outer turns of each TF-coil bundle are clamped together by insulated preloaded studs to provide increased bending stiffness. These sections of the outer bundles depend on friction to react the lateral loads as a bundle rather than six individual turns. A major {{concern is that the}} increased loads will produce slip between turns resulting in excessive lateral deflections and possible damage to the insulating sleeve on the preloaded studs. A finite element structural model of the TF-coil was developed for the calculation of deflections and the shear load distribution throughout the coil for the applied lateral loads from a full current calibration shot. The purpose of the updated structural model is to correlate the applied lateral loads to the total shear force between the unbonded sections of the outer turns. An allowable integrated lateral load applied to the outer turns is established based on the maximum shear force that can be reacted by friction. A program that calculates the magnetic fields and integrated lateral load along the outer turns can be incorporated into the plasma control system. The integrated load can then be compared to the calculated allowable value prior to execution of calibration shots. Calibration shots with a calculated total lateral load greater than the allowable value will be prevented...|$|E

50|$|A humbucker pickup is {{electrically}} equivalent two single-coil pickups wired {{together in}} series.
