He joined the far-right Ustaše in 1939, and following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and the establishment of the Ustaše-led NDH in April 1941, went on to be appointed to the newly formed Ustaše <b>supervisory</b> <b>committee</b> by Slavko Kvaternik. That same month he also became the leader of the Ustaše University Headquarters and the Ustaše Youth, charged with organizing student bodies at the University of Zagreb and promoting Ustaše's policy of preventing all non-Croats from attending universities in the country.|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction] The {{decisions}} {{taken by}} the EU finance ministers at the Ecofin Council meeting in December 2007, {{in response to the}} turmoil in the markets, highlight the urgent need to subject the current European supervisory set-up to a more radical review. The measures proposed and the mandates given to the Commission and the <b>supervisory</b> <b>committees</b> constitute little more than short-term plumbing, lacking any long-term vision and a coherent institutional framework. The clearest example of this short-sightedness is the move to allow <b>supervisory</b> <b>committees</b> to take decisions by majority vote. Although this move is to be welcomed, it lacks any legal basis, as it concerns committees that are empowered to act merely in an advisory capacity, and whose advice can thus be ignored by member states, as some have already implied is their intention...|$|R

25|$|In {{common with}} all of the major UN human rights treaties, the ICCPR {{requires}} states that have ratified the Covenant to submit an initial report for consideration by a <b>supervisory</b> <b>committee,</b> in this case the Human Rights Committee, and thereafter to submit periodical reports at intervals of (in the case of the ICCPR) five years. The reports are expected to detail progress in implementing the treaty in domestic law and practice. The state's delegation appears before the Human Rights Committee in Geneva or New York to discuss the report, in a public process usually referred to as an 'examination' but officially termed a 'dialogue with the State Party'. At the end of a session (in which several states are considered) the committee issues 'concluding observations' on each state, using the report, the dialogue, and any other relevant information submitted by, for example, national human rights institutions or non-governmental organisations. These observations are used to commend the state for any progress in the implementation of ICCPR principles and to identify areas where improvement is expected.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 the {{municipality}} of Tripoli signed {{the first and}} so far only management contract for water supply in Lebanon. This was done {{after four years of}} preparation that required passing a new law (Law 401) to allow public-private partnerships in water supply. The contract was awarded to the French company Ondéo‐Liban, a subsidiary of Suez Environnement, after a competitive bidding process. The cost of 20 million Euro was financed by the French Development Agency. The contract included the operation, maintenance, and installation of equipment, the organization of the billing system and collection of water tariffs, the management of human and financial resources, and the supervision of the construction of a tertiary water supply network and the expansion of a water treatment plant. The private company increased the billing efficiency from 30% to 60%, reduced water rationing, mapped the network, updated the customer inventory, computerized the accounting system and trained staff. Non-revenue water was reduced from 65% to 45% and the 10-year-long water rationing in the areas of Qalamoun, Qobbe and Abi Samra was eliminated, making Tripoli the only city in Lebanon that receives water 24 hours per day. Water quality and the customer service were also improved. However, cost recovery was not achieved despite an increase in tariffs because bill collection efficiency remained low. The company was unable to introduce metering, although 40,000 meters were acquired. The contract faced a number of challenges: According {{to a study by the}} French Institute for Public-Private Partnerships, the <b>supervisory</b> <b>committee</b> was composed of former employees of the public water company who were not convinced of the usefulness of private sector participation. Despite its achievements, the management contract ended in 2007 without being extended.|$|E
