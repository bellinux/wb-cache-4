25|$|Contact with or {{manipulation}} of scoring elements (such as targets or ramps) scores {{points for the}} player. Electrical switches embedded in the scoring elements detect contact and relay this information to the scoring mechanism. Older pinball machines used an electromechanical system for scoring wherein a pulse from a switch would cause a complex mechanism composed of relays to ratchet up the score. In later games these tasks have {{been taken over by}} <b>semiconductor</b> <b>chips</b> and displays are made on electronic segmented or dot-matrix displays (DMD). The first DMD on a pinball machine was used by Checkpoint and features also video mode minigames. MarsaPlay in Spain manufactured a remake of Inder's original Canasta titled New Canasta, with an LCD screen in the backbox in 2010. The Wizard of Oz is the first US pinball machine that used a LCD in the back box. It is not only used for scoring and mini-games but also to display full color videos. Other display innovations on pinball machines include pinball video game hybrids like Baby Pac-Man in 1982 and Granny and the Gators in 1984 and the use of a small color video monitor for scoring and minigames in the backbox of the pinball machine Dakar from manufacturer Mr. Game in 1988 and CGA color monitors in Pinball 2000 in 1999 that utilizes a Pepper's Ghost technique to reflect the monitor in the head of the as well as modifications by the use of ColorDMD that is used to replace the standard mono color DMDs.|$|E

40|$|Wire bonding, {{a process}} of the {{connection}} between a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>chip</b> and a lead frame by a thin metal wire, is one of the important processes of electronic packaging. This paper presents failure estimation of a silicon chip and a GaAS chip during a gold wire bonding process. The gold wire bonding process is carried out by pressing a gold ball made at a tip of the gold wire on a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>chip</b> and vibrating it by ultrasonic. High contact pressure is useful for shortening the process cycle, but it sometimes causes failure of the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>chip.</b> Elastic-plastic large deformation contact analyses are performed and the distributions of the stresses in these semicon-ductor chips are investigated.
