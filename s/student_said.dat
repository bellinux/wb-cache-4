25|$|A German {{exchange}} <b>student</b> <b>said</b> he {{was beaten}} randomly by riot police in the Exarheia district, his only reason for being there that he had accompanied other students to eat. The student gives a horrifying description of the violence he endured, he cowered in a corner when he saw police because {{a few weeks before}} he had witnessed police beating a man they had arrested. He claims that upon spotting him, about six police officers started beating him with their batons, and when they left they were replaced by another group of police. The student was unarmed and posed no threat but the police were ruthlessly brutal in their actions. It has been indicated that riot police left beaten and gravely individuals without any medical assistance. Amnesty International urges Greece to effectively and promptly investigate these crimes against civilians, which clearly violate human rights, and hold perpetrators accountable.|$|E
25|$|Hinsley {{wrote that}} it was {{difficult}} to measure the influence of intelligence gained during the battle, because although Ultra revealed German situation reports, reinforcement details and unit identifications and that more intelligence was gleaned from prisoners and captured documents, it was not known how swiftly the information reached Freyberg or how he used it. The German parachute warfare manual had been captured in 1940 and after the war, <b>Student</b> <b>said</b> that he would have changed tactics, had he known. Field signals intelligence was obtained, including bombing instructions and information from the Fliegerkorps XI tactical code. Lack of air cover prevented much British air reconnaissance north of Crete but on 21 May, signals intelligence enabled an aircraft to spot a convoy. After midnight, twelve ships were sunk by the navy and the rest scattered, which led to a second invasion convoy being called back. The second convoy was intercepted during the morning of 22 May, despite the cost to the navy of a daylight operation and no more seaborne attempts were made.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} drinking patterns, alcohol-related flushing, {{and ways}} students themselves {{and other people}} respond to flushing in drinking situations. Of 1080 Chinese undergraduate university students given the survey questionnaire, 725 (67. 1 %) returned the completed surveys. Eighty {{percent of the students}} were drinkers (93 % of males and 69 % of females); 68 % of the drinkers were flushers. Most of the students (59. 3 %) said flushing had no special meaning, that is, would ignore flushing; 54 % of the flushers said they could keep drinking “but less” when they flush; 27 % of the <b>students</b> <b>said</b> that a flushing person should stop drinking; however, if the flushing person is a girl, 89 % of the <b>students</b> <b>said</b> the girl should drink less or stop. If the flushing person was a boy, 61 % of <b>students</b> <b>said</b> he should drink less or stop. The data do suggest gender differences in the understanding of and social reaction to alcohol-related flushing, and these differences raise interesting questions as to how flushing acts as a potential protective factor against alcohol misuse...|$|R

[...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix who is not a fan of Elaine Stritch's role on the show enjoyed her in this episode, writing that along with the appearances of Elizabeth Banks and Alan Alda [...] "I decided to hope their presence would counteract my feelings about hers – which is pretty much what happened."

A Rutgers information technology analyst reported that iChat connections were made with Ravi's computer from these students' computers at 6:58 and 7:44p.m. on September 21. The first <b>student</b> <b>said</b> that Ravi encouraged him to text friends to watch Clementi's date and that Ravi used his computer to test {{the angle of the}} webcam so that it was pointed at Clementi's bed.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{provides}} {{a detailed description}} of the environmental education of elementary school students in Da Nang city, Vietnam. In January 2014, the study surveyed 247 students in two elementary schools. An evaluation of the students' knowledge of solid waste management was conducted. Students had basic knowledge about the environment, but their knowledge was limited with regard to solid waste management. In February 2015, an environmental education workshop was conducted for the students. The result showed that 96 % of the students were interested in solid waste management activities. In addition, the study found that there were changes in the students' knowledge before and after environmental education activities. Before the activity 29 % of the <b>students</b> <b>said</b> that they knew about eco-bags, and 55 % of the <b>students</b> <b>said</b> that they knew “that plastic bags are difficult to decompose naturally. ” After environmental education 87 % of the students answered that they knew about eco-bags, and 71 % of the <b>students</b> <b>said</b> that they knew “that plastic bags are difficult to decompose naturally. ” Given these results, this study was successful in increasing students' knowledge about solid waste management...|$|R

2500|$|College {{enrollment}} reached 9 {{million by}} the end of the 1960s. Colleges and universities in America had more students than ever before, and these institutions often tried to restrict student behavior to maintain order on the campuses. To combat this, many college students became active in causes that promoted free speech, student input in the curriculum, and an end to archaic social restrictions. Students joined the antiwar movement because they did not want to fight in a foreign civil war that they believed did not concern them or because they were morally opposed to all war. Others disliked the war because it diverted funds and attention away from problems in the U.S. Intellectual growth and gaining a liberal perspective at college caused many students to become active in the antiwar movement. Another attractive feature of the opposition movement was the fact that it was a popular social event. As one <b>student</b> <b>said,</b> antiwar demonstrations were the places to [...] "get laid, get high, and listen to some great rock." ...|$|E

As I was in -- in that 48-hour time period read the grand jury presentment, I reached the conclusion that given what had become public about the issues leading up to the presentment and given what was {{said in the}} presentment itself about Coach Paterno's testimony and about what the graduate <b>student</b> <b>said</b> to Coach Paterno, I felt that it would not send the right message if Coach Paterno was able to lead the football team out onto the field of play under those circumstances. So I didn't change my mind {{on the question of whether}} we had established all the key facts that related to Coach Paterno's involvement and/or responsibility. But I had reached the conclusion that, from the standpoint of what the University's values would be interpreted to be by the broader public, that what was known was sufficiently serious as it relates to child sexual abuse that it would send the wrong message about our values as a University if Coach Paterno were allowed to coach as though none of this had ever happened." ...|$|E
