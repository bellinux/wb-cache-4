25|$|The Caravan {{was one of}} {{a number}} of similar clubs in London's West End in the inter-war years that were among the {{principal}} gathering places of gay men and often included an element of female prostitution and low-level criminality. All were vulnerable to attention from the police, though in practice this tended to happen only if third parties such as morality crusaders or official bodies asked the police to intervene. The Ministry of Defence in particular was concerned to prevent servicemen visiting such establishments and certain venues were patrolled by the Military Police and known to be off-limits but while registered pubs, restaurants and cafes could be entered freely by the police and their owners were approved before a licence was given, private clubs were harder to monitor as a senior officer's permission was required to place them under surveillance and a magistrate's warrant was needed in order to conduct a raid. Once closed, they could <b>simply</b> <b>set</b> up somewhere else under a new name. Neave, for instance, was already on his third club (at least) by the time he opened the Caravan in 1934.|$|E

500|$|Five {{distinct}} {{methods of}} breaking up a marriage {{existed in the}} early modern period of English history. One was to sue in the ecclesiastical courts for separation from bed and board (a mensa et thoro), {{on the grounds of}} adultery or life-threatening cruelty, but it did not allow a remarriage. From the 1550s, until the Matrimonial Causes Act became law in 1857, divorce in England was only possible, if at all, by the complex and costly procedure of a private Act of Parliament. [...] Although the divorce courts set up {{in the wake of the}} 1857 Act made the procedure considerably cheaper, divorce remained prohibitively expensive for the poorer members of society. [...] An alternative was to obtain a [...] "private separation", an agreement negotiated between both spouses, embodied in a deed of separation drawn up by a conveyancer. Desertion or elopement was also possible, whereby the wife was forced out of the family home, or the husband <b>simply</b> <b>set</b> up a new home with his mistress. Finally, the less popular notion of wife selling was an alternative but illegitimate method of ending a marriage. The Laws Respecting Women, As They Regard Their Natural Rights (1777) observed that, for the poor, wife selling was viewed as a [...] "method of dissolving marriage", when [...] "a husband and wife find themselves heartily tired of each other, and agree to part, if the man has a mind to authenticate the intended separation by making it a matter of public notoriety".|$|E

2500|$|There are {{currently}} 739 licensed cable distributors in Canada. This significant decline from over 2000 {{just a few}} years ago is attributable both to major cable companies acquiring smaller distributors and to a recent change in CRTC rules by which independent cable operators with fewer than 2,000 subscribers are no longer required to operate under full CRTC licences.

2500|$|The Columbine High School {{massacre}} in Colorado on April20, 1999 was another seminal event in SWAT tactics and police response.

[...] The article further reported that street officers were increasingly being armed with rifles, and issued heavy body armor and ballistic helmets, items traditionally associated with SWAT units. The idea was to train and equip street officers to make a rapid response to so-called active-shooter situations. In these situations, it was no longer acceptable to <b>simply</b> <b>set</b> up a perimeter and wait for SWAT.
