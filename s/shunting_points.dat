40|$|Craniocervical {{junction}} dural arteriovenous fistula (CCJDAVF) fed by bilateral vertebral arteries (VAs) {{is extremely}} rare. We report {{a case of}} a 63 -year-old man presenting with progressive myelopathy caused by a CCJDAVF, which was fed by bilateral VAs and occipital and ascending pharyngeal arteries with multiple <b>shunting</b> <b>points</b> and that drained into intracranial sinus and spinal veins. The dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) was successfully treated surgically using stepwise indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography. After surgery, the DAVF disappeared and myelopathy was markedly improved. We show detailed preoperative images and intraoperative findings of this rare DAVF and emphasize the importance of selective angiography for preoperative evaluation of feeding arteries and the usefulness of intraoperative ICG videoangiography for both identification of the fistula and confirmation of its obliteration. 両側の椎骨動脈を栄養動脈とする頭蓋頸椎移行部硬膜動静脈廔（CCJDAVF）は極めて稀な病態である. 本症例は 63 歳男性で, 進行性脊髄症により見つかったCCJDAVF である. 両側椎骨動脈をはじめとした複数の栄養動脈を有し, 複数のシャントポイントを介して頭蓋内静脈洞および脊髄静脈へと流出する稀な病態を呈しており, 直達手術により完治した. 手術では, 術中インドシアニングリーン（ICG）蛍光血管撮影を繰り返し用いて, CCJDAVFの解剖学的構造および血流動態を把握しながら段階的に栄養動脈を処理し, 最終的に流出静脈を遮断した. 最後に再びICG 蛍光血管撮影を行い, CCJDAVFの消失を確認した. 術後, 脊髄症は著明に改善した. 複数の流入動脈およびシャントポイントを有する本症例の複雑な病態把握においては, 術前の選択的血管撮影を用いた流入動脈の評価が重要であった. 術中ICG 蛍光血管撮影を繰り返し用いることにより, 病変の同定および廔孔の消失を, 確実に行うことが可能であった...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} a project targeted to {{the recovery of}} the area of Montesanto, in the historical city of Naples, through a route network devoted to a prevailing pedestrian use. At present, relevant urban equipments are located in the area; moreover, this area represents one of the main junction of the urban railway network, the <b>shunting</b> <b>point</b> of relevant flows of users either towards the Greek-Roman part of the historical city or towards the directional area and the monumental core.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} quasiclassical {{equations}} for non-equilibrium Green’s functions we derive a simple kinetic equation that governs ac Josephson effect in a superconducting quantum point contact at small bias voltages. In contrast to existing approaches the kinetic equation is valid for voltages with arbitrary time dependence. We use this equation to calculate frequency-dependent linear conductance, and dc I −V characteristics {{with and without}} microwave radiation for resistively <b>shunted</b> quantum <b>point</b> contacts. A novel feature of the I −V characteristics is the excess current 2 Ic/π appearing at small voltages. An important by-product of our derivation is the analytical proof that the microscopic expression for the current coincides at arbitrary voltages with the expression that follows from the Bogolyubov-de Gennes equations, if one uses appropriate amplitudes of Andreev reflection which contain information about microscopic structure of the superconductors...|$|R
30|$|Microscopic rail models, by contrast, {{portray the}} {{networks}} in great detail. They {{take into account}} information concerning tracks (e.g. the number, length and alignment of the block sections, speed, gradient), features of the signalling system (e.g. signal position, release points, permissive occupancy), layout of stations (e.g. number of tracks, length of platforms, <b>shunting</b> yards, <b>points,</b> vehicle depots), characteristics of the rolling stock (e.g. acceleration/deceleration features, tractive/effort diagram, total and adherence load), operational information (e.g. departure/arrival times, routes, alternative platforms, timing points, dwell times, connections between runs) as well as safety conditions. The variation of each attribute leads {{to the creation of}} a new node and hence necessarily of a new link. Such modelling of the infrastructure can be used for operational needs such as calculating travel times, drawing up timetables, detecting probable train conflicts, addressing disruption conditions and testing rescheduling strategies. Hence, they provide very accurate results, albeit requiring the collection of a large amount of data and considerable computational effort.|$|R

Hydrocortisone is used for patients whose hypotension does not respond to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. Opening and keeping open the microcirculation is a consideration in the treatment of distributive shock, as a result limiting the use of vasopressors has been suggested.

40|$|The Power Quality (PQ) in {{distribution}} system {{is affected by}} the pollution introduced by the customers. Voltage Sag is one of the Power Quality problem created by the nonlinear loads. When nonlinear load is connected to a source, there is a dip in the voltage which could be critical for the entire system.

The proposed design uses a standard three-leg inverter (one leg for each phase) and an H-bridge in series with each inverter leg which uses a capacitor as the dc power source.

40|$|Portal vein tumor {{thrombosis}} (PVTT) often {{occurs in}} advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. PVTT may cause tumor dissemination, liver failure, and portal hypertension, thus leading to intractable ascites, variceal rupture, and hepatic encephalopathy, which {{will result in}} a poor prognosis. According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System, sorafenib is recommended as the first-line treatment for advanced HCC with PVTT, but its application in China has been limited due to its mild efficacy and high price.

40|$|Modelling {{of solar}} cells today is general {{practice}} {{in research and}} widely-used in industry. Established modelling software is typically limited to one dimension and/or to small scales. Additionally, novel effects, like, e. g., the use of diffractive structures or luminescent materials, are not established.

40|$|Purpose. Development and {{implementation}} the points system diagnostics {{that would allow}} determining remotely {{the current state of}} turnout with all possible faults, gradual and sudden failures, damages, and in real time to report about their appearance. Methodology. State diagnostics on the values analysis of turnout main parameters is proposed to carry out {{with the help of a}} computer and analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Connecting measurements performance is advisable to produce to a shunt ammeter, installed in the working circuit of the point feed panel. ADC converts the analog signal of lost volts at the shunt into digital form and transmits it to a computer which stores the received data on its own recording medium for their further processing and storage. There is special software that is capable to reconnect signal and construct its temporal characteristic as well as decompose it on the spectral components. Using it one can analyze the obtained data, which allows diagnosing state of points upon change the nature, values and composition of the current curve. Findings. The computer diagnosis method was confirmed in practice for possible indications of problems that are associated with both the mechanical part of the turnout and the electrical part of it, while controlling parameters such as the amount of current normal transition, when working on frictions, the duration of the transition, properly adjusted headset and attachment points, the state of the motor. Originality. The use of computer technology in the diagnosis of the state of turnouts during their operation to monitor the current values of technical indicators, analysis and storage for all types of electric switches with different types of engines both DC and AC occurs through digitization and recording signal from measuring <b>shunt</b> of <b>point</b> feeder panel. Practical value. The proposed method enables timely, still in the early stages of defect parts, damages or failures of nodes mechanisms to detect and eliminate them.

40|$|OBJECT: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the long-term results of a flow-regulating shunt (Orbis Sigma Valve [OSV] II Smart Valve System; Integra NeuroSciences, Sophia Antipolis, France) in the treatment of hydrocephalus, whether it was a first insertion procedure or surgical revision of another type of shunt, in everyday clinical practice in a multicenter prospective study. METHODS: Patients of any age who had hydrocephalus underwent implantation of an OSV II system. The primary end point of the study was defined as any shunt-related surgery. The secondary end point was a mechanical complication (shunt obstruction, overdrainage, catheter misplacement, migration, or disconnection) or infection. The overall 5 -year shunt survival rates and survival as it applied to different patient subgroups were assessed. Five hundred fifty-seven patients (48 % of whom were adults and 52 % of whom were children) were selected for OSV II shunt implantation; 196 patients reached the primary end <b>point.</b> <b>Shunt</b> obstruction occurred in 75 patients (13. 5 %), overdrainage in 10 patients (1. 8 %), and infection in 46 patients (8. 2 %). The probability of having experienced a shunt failure-free interval at 1 year was 71 % and at 2 years it was 67 %; thereafter the probability remained quite stable in following years (62 % at the 5 -year follow-up examination). No difference in shunt survival was observed between the overall pediatric (<or = 16 years of age) and adult populations. In the pediatric age group, however, there was a significantly lower rate of shunt survival in children younger than 6 months of age (55 % at the 5 -year follow-up examination). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of flow regulation in the treatment of hydrocephalus both in children and in adults. Flow-regulating shunts limit the incidence of overdrainage and shunt-related complications. The overall 5 -year shunt survival rate (62 %) compares favorably with rates cited in other recently published serie...|$|R
