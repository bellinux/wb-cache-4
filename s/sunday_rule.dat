50|$|Before 2011 presidential {{elections}} took place 90 {{days before the}} incumbent president's term expired. If that day was not a Sunday, the election {{was moved to the}} next Sunday. A runoff election —if necessary— took place 30 days after the first election. The <b>Sunday</b> <b>rule</b> was also observed. Since 1990 the president has taken office on March 11; thus, elections took place on or after December 11 of the previous year.|$|E
50|$|Carry-out alcohol {{sales were}} {{strictly}} prohibited on Sundays until 2010, when the State amended its laws to permit qualified breweries to sell local brews for carryout (generally growlers). Restaurants and taverns can generally still serve alcoholic beverages. Alcohol sales {{are no longer}} prohibited on New Years Day unless it falls on a Sunday. The <b>Sunday</b> <b>rule</b> that prohibits alcohol sales at carry-out venues is still in effect. In 2010, a change in legislation allowed Indiana residents to purchase alcohol on Election Day. Christmas sales are still prohibited.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sunday</b> trading <b>rules</b> vary {{considerably}} across Europe, with some countries allowing shops to open freely, {{while others have}} tight restrictions on opening hours. In light of a proposal to decentralise restrictions on Sunday trading in England and Wales, Ed Turner writes on the lessons Germany’s decentralisation of Sunday trading laws could provide for other countries. He notes that if the German experience held true, it could be expected {{that there would be}} a gradual move toward removing restrictions under such a proposal, with politicians divided on the issue, and variations driven by regional economic interests...|$|R
50|$|The relaxed {{nature of}} the Sunday trading hours in the Republic of Ireland saw in the past {{a large amount of}} people from Northern Ireland {{travelling}} over the border to shop, eat and drink as Northern Ireland traditionally had very strict <b>Sunday</b> trading <b>rules</b> - and still does by comparison. For example, pubs in Northern Ireland were not permitted to open on Sundays until 1989. This affected trading in key border towns and cities especially in counties Donegal, Monaghan, Louth and Cavan. Many people from Northern Ireland would spend most of their Sundays over the border, as nearly all of their shops, pubs and restaurants were open.|$|R
50|$|Bank {{and public}} {{holidays}} in Scotland are determined under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 and the St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007. Unlike {{the rest of}} United Kingdom, most bank holidays are not recognised as statutory public holidays in Scotland, as most public holidays are determined by local authorities across Scotland. Some of these may be taken in lieu of statutory holidays, while others may be additional holidays, although many companies, including Royal Mail, do not follow all the holidays listed below; and many swap between English and local holidays. Many large shops and supermarkets continue to operate normally during public holidays, especially {{since there are no}} restrictions such as <b>Sunday</b> trading <b>rules</b> in Scotland.|$|R
50|$|At present, monks in Stavrovouni live a {{very strict}} form of monastic life, {{similar to that}} of the monks on Mount Athos. The rule of their first abbot, Dionysios A', forms the basis of this. Women are not allowed to enter the main part of the monastery, but they are allowed to visit the chapel out of it on the top of the hill. They are also allowed to visit the Metochi Agia Varvara at the foot of the hill only on <b>Sundays.</b> This <b>rule</b> is called avato (Greek: άβατο) (meaning: entry is prohibited), and it is {{analogous}} to the strict life of monks in Mount Athos where women are not allowed to enter. This rule is applied in order to keep the monks isolated and living a stricter way of life.|$|R
50|$|Several {{steps were}} taken {{prior to the}} {{establishment}} of the Library. A supervised study hall was set up in 1936 to see whether students would use it. Proving successful, the Board of Trustees authorized a Business Administration Reading Room with an appropriation of $600 to furnish the room. The first books in the library were delivered by Harold Lusk, Chairman of the Library committee which established the Library delivered the Library's first books in his car! The reading room had 61 seats and was open from 7:45 a.m. to 9:50 p.m. Monday through Friday, 7:45 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Saturday and 2 p.m. to 9:50 p.m. on <b>Sunday.</b> Library <b>rules</b> directed that overdue books were to be returned to the Dean's office and that fines should be paid there.|$|R
5000|$|The general {{method of}} play today is counterclockwise, {{although}} clockwise play has been permitted {{on one day}} each year in recent years, and for several special one off events since. Originally, the course was reversed every week in order to let the grass recover better. One other unusual thing about the Old Course {{is that it is}} closed on Sundays to let the course rest. On some Sundays, the course turns into a park for all the townspeople who come out to stroll, picnic and otherwise enjoy the grounds. As a general <b>rule,</b> <b>Sunday</b> play is allowed on the course on only four occasions: ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{exception}} to this rule occurred during Week 16 of the 2016 season when KCBS-TV in Los Angeles was granted special permission to air a Colts-Raiders game in the 1:05 p.m. PT late slot while the Los Angeles Rams hosted the 49ers {{at the same time}} at home on Fox. Although KCBS had the single game and was contractually obligated to carry the San Diego Chargers game at the Cleveland Browns in the early 10 a.m. PT slot since Los Angeles is an official secondary market of the Chargers, the Colts-Raiders game had playoff implications as well as being featured as the network's top game of the week. [...] It {{should also be noted that}} Week 16 games were played on Saturday, as Christmas Day fell on a <b>Sunday.</b> Under NFL <b>rules,</b> the traditional <b>Sunday</b> day package is played on Saturdays should Christmas Day fall on a Sunday.|$|R
5000|$|In Burma, Uposatha (called [...] ubot nei) is {{observed}} by more pious Buddhists {{on the following}} days: waxing moon ( [...] la hsan), full moon ( [...] la pyei nei), waning moon ( [...] la hsote), and new moon ( [...] la kwe nei). The most common days of observance are the full moon and the new moon. In pre-colonial Burma, the Uposatha day (commonly rendered as the Buddhist Sabbath in English) was a legal holiday that was observed primarily in urban areas, where secular activities like business transactions came to a halt. However, since colonial <b>rule,</b> <b>Sunday</b> has replaced the Uposatha day as the legal day of rest. All major Burmese Buddhist holidays occur on Uposatha days, namely Thingyan, {{the beginning of the}} Buddhist lent (beginning in the full moon of Waso, around July to the full moon of Thadingyut, around October). During this period, Uposatha is more commonly observed by Buddhists than {{during the rest of the}} year. During Uposatha days, Buddhist monks at each monastery assemble and recite the patimokkha, a concise compilation of the Vinaya.|$|R
5000|$|It {{came to a}} head in {{the middle}} of the war with the writing of a column in the New York World-Telegram by Pegler, who alleged that {{merchant}} seamen refused to work on <b>Sundays</b> per union <b>rules,</b> causing sick USMC servicemen to unload their own supplies in an incident off Guadalcanal. He went on to say that these seamen received [...] "fabulous pay for sailors, including overtime bonuses, whereas the navy men draw only the modest pay for their ratings without extras." [...] This was a specific allegation, and in February 1943, the National Maritime Union, representing seven other unions, filed suit for libel against Hearst Newspapers, publisher of the newspaper, and the Associated Press for its wide dissemination of what was claimed to be an untrue story. As part of their suit, they pointed out that Government allotments for families, low-rate premiums on insurance, hospitalization, dental care, pension, and civil service rating consideration tend to balance the pay of ordinary seamen in civilian service. But they denied the incident ever took place, and were backed by a report of Admiral William F. Halsey, commander of United States forces in the South Pacific, to the Navy Department in which Halsey praised the [...] "co-operation, efficiency and courage" [...] of the merchant seamen and asserted that [...] "In no instance have merchant marine seamen refused to discharge cargo from their vessels or in any other way failed to co-operate with the United States forces ashore in that (South Pacific) area." [...] They won their suit, but the residual effect would last for decades.|$|R
5000|$|Holy Week {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely celebrated and {{important}} religious observances in Mexico. Almost all towns and cities in the country have some kind of public observance during a two-week period that starts from Palm Sunday at least to Easter Sunday and can extend into the week after. Mexican television features movies, documentaries and other shows focused on the religious event and other topics related to the Catholic faith, especially in Latin America. The U.S. traditions surrounding Easter have made very little inroads in Mexico, with icons such as the Easter Bunny and events such as Easter egg hunts limited to supermarkets and areas right along the border with the United States. Like most Mexican Catholic traditions, those related to Holy Week and Easter are based on the Spanish Catholic calendar. Holy Week is preceded by Lent and Ash Wednesday, which itself is preceded by Carnival [...] However, a number of traditions and customs have developed over the centuries. As most Holy Week related events occur outside and in large gatherings, “antojitos” (roughly translated as Mexican street food or snacks) is the most associated with the holiday. Prior to Easter <b>Sunday,</b> Lenten dietary <b>rules</b> are still in effect for the observant, so popular street foods include pambazos with cheese, fried fish, fried plantains, hot cakes/pancakes with various toppings. Candies are a popular street food at this time, especially traditional and regional ones made from coconut, tamarind and various fruits. Holy Week was also the traditional start of the ice cream and flavored ice season, which was originally made in Mexico City with ice and snow brought down from the Popocatepetl volcano. Ice cream fairs are still held at this time. Today’s frozen treats include ice cream in tubs, as well as popsicles made from both fruit and cream, as well as snow cones called “raspados.” Another popular refreshment is called “aguas frescas” or sugared drinks made from fruit or other natural flavorings such as tamarind or hibiscus flowers. The reason for the popularity of both frozen desserts and flavored drinks is that spring to early summer is generally the warmest part of the year in many parts of Mexico.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{would happen}} if you threw an engine off the line?" [...] "Can't say that I know exactly. You see, our {{business}} is to keep them on, and we do that. Here's rather a curiosity. You see that pointsman! They say he's an old mutineer, and when he relaxes he boasts of the Sahibs he has killed. He's glad enough to eat the Company's salt now." [...] Such a withered old face was the face of the pointsman at No. 11 point! The information suggested a host of questions, and the answers were these: [...] "You won't be able to understand till you've been down into a mine. We work our men in two ways: some by direct payment--under our own hand, and some by contractors. The contractor undertakes to deliver us the coal, supplying his own men, tools, and props. He's responsible for the safety of his men, and of course the Company knows and sees his work. Just fancy, among these five thousand people, what sort of effect the news of an accident would produce! It would go all through the Sonthal Parganas. We have any amount of Sonthals besides Mahometans and Hindus of every possible caste, down to those Musahers who eat pig. They don't require much administering in the civilian sense of the word. On <b>Sundays,</b> as a <b>rule,</b> if any man has had his daughter eloped with, or anything of that kind, he generally comes up to the manager's bungalow to get the matter put straight. If a man is disabled through accident he knows that as long as he's in the hospital he gets full wages, and the Company pays for the food of any of his women-folk who come to look after him. One, of course; not the whole clan. That makes our service popular with the people. Don't you believe that a native is a fool. You can train him to everything except responsibility. There's a rule in the workings that if there is any dangerous work--we haven't choke-damp; I will show you when we get down--no gang must work without an Englishman to look after them. A native wouldn't be wise enough to understand what the danger was, or where it came in. Even if he did, he'd shirk the responsibility. We can't afford to risk a single life. All our output is just as much as the Company want--about a thousand tons per working day. Three hundred thousand in the year. We could turn out more? Yes--a little. Well, yes, twice as much. I won't go on, because you wouldn't believe me. There's the coal under us, and we work it at any depth from following up an outcrop down to six hundred feet. That is our deepest shaft. We have no necessity to go deeper. At home the mines are sometimes fifteen hundred feet down. Well, the thickness of this coal here varies from anything you please to anything you please. There's enough of it to last your time and one or two hundred years longer. Perhaps even longer than that. Look at that stuff. That's big coal from the pit." ...|$|R
