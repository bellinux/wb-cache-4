40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that toluene dose-dependently inhibits recombinant N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors at micromolar concentrations. This inhibition was rapid, almost complete and reversible. The NR 1 / 2 B combination {{was the most}} sensitive receptor subtype tested with an IC 50 value for toluene of 0. 17 [*]mM. We now report {{on the effects of}} other commonly <b>abused</b> <b>solvents</b> (benzene, m-xylene, ethylbenzene, propylbenzene, 1, 1, 1 -trichlorethane (TCE) and those of a convulsive solvent, 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl ether (flurothyl), on NMDA-induced currents measured in Xenopus oocytes expressing NR 1 / 2 A or NR 1 / 2 B receptor subtypes. All of the alkylbenzenes and TCE produced a reversible inhibition of NMDA-induced currents that was dose- and subunit-dependent. The NR 1 / 2 B receptor subtype was several times more sensitive to these compounds than the NR 1 / 2 A subtype. The convulsant solvent flurothyl had no effect on NMDA responses in oocytes but potently inhibited ion flux through recombinant GABA receptors expressed in oocytes. Overall, these results suggest that <b>abused</b> <b>solvents</b> display pharmacological selectivity and that NR 1 / 2 B NMDA receptors may be an important target for the actions of these compounds on the brain...|$|R
40|$|Toluene (methylbenzene; {{volatile}} hydrocarbon) is {{an industrial}} solvent that causes major {{injury to the}} lungs; the organ being the first capillary bed encountered. We report an unusual case of suicide by a 24 -year-old male, paramedical professional, with fatal outcome within 16 h of intentional, intravenous self-administration of toluene, with clinical presentation of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Psychological autopsy revealed severe depressive disorder and <b>solvent</b> (inhalant) <b>abuse,</b> with marital disharmony as the precipitating stressor for suicide.

50|$|In {{the short}} term, death from <b>solvent</b> <b>abuse</b> occurs most {{commonly}} from aspiration of vomit while unconscious {{or from a}} combination of respiratory depression and hypoxia, the second cause being especially a risk with heavier-than-air vapors such as butane or gasoline vapor.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} has been to assess the {{characteristics}} of acute poisoning deaths in Poland {{over a period of time}} 2009 – 2013. Material and Methods: The analysis was based on the data obtained from the patient records stored in toxicology departments in 6 cities – Łódź, Kraków, Sosnowiec, Gdańsk, Wrocław and Poznań. Toxicological analyses were routinely performed in blood and/or urine. Major toxic substances were classified to one of the following categories: pharmaceuticals, alcohol group poisonings (ethanol and other alcohols), gases, <b>solvents,</b> drugs of <b>abuse,</b> pesticides, metals, mushrooms, others. Cases were analyzed according to the following criteria: year, age and gender of analyzed patients, toxic substance category and type of poisoning. The recorded fatal poisonings were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases. Results: The record of 261 deaths were retrospectively reviewed. There were 187 males (71. 64 %) and 74 females (28. 36 %) and the male to female ratio was 2. 52. Alcohol group poisonings were more frequently responsible for deaths in men compared to all poisonings, 91. 1 % vs. 71. 6 %, respectively (p < 0. 05), and pharmaceutical agents were more frequently responsible for deaths in women, 47. 4 % vs. 28. 4 %, (p < 0. 05). Methanol was the most common agent in the alcohol group poisonings, accounting for 43. 75 % (N = 49), followed by ethylene glycol, 39. 29 % (N = 44), and ethanol, 16. 96 % (N = 19). Conclusions: Epidemiological profile data from investigation of poisoning deaths in Poland may be very useful for the development of preventive programs.

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} and sniffing of volatile organic solvents {{continue to be}} a worldwide health problem, raising the risk for teratogenic sequelae of maternal inhalant abuse. Real life exposures usually involve simultaneous exposures to multiple solvents, and almost all the <b>abused</b> <b>solvents</b> contain a mixture of two or more different volatile compounds. However, several studies examined the teratogenicity due to industrial exposure to a single volatile solvent but investigating the teratogenic potential of complex chemical mixture such as thinner remains unexplored. This study was undertaken to evaluate developmental neurotoxicity of paint thinner using a mouse model. Mated female mice (N = 21) were, therefore, exposed to repeated and brief inhalation episodes of 0, 300 or 600 ppm of thinner during the entire period of pregnancy. Females weigh was recorded and their standard fertility and reproductive parameters were assessed. After birth postnatal day 1 (PND 1), offspring (N = 88) length and body weight were measured in a daily basis. At PND 5, the pups were assessed for their postnatal growth, physical maturation, reflex development, neuromotor abilities, sensory function, activity level, anxiety, depression, learning and memory functions. At adulthood, structural changes of the hippocampus were examined by estimating the total volume of the dentate gyrus. Except one case of thinner induced abortion at the higher dose, our results showed that the prenatal exposure to the solvent did not cause any maternal toxicity or decrease in the viability of the offspring. Therefore, a lower birth weight, decrease in the litter size and delayed reflexes ontogeny were registered in prenatally exposed offspring to both 300 ppm and 600 ppm of thinner. In addition, prenatally exposure to thinner resulted in increased anxiolytic- and depression-like behaviors. In contrast, impaired learning and memory functions and decreased hippocampal dentate gyrus volume were revealed only in the prenatally treated offspring by 600 ppm of thinner. Based on these results, we can conclude that prenatally exposure to paint thinner causes a long-lasting developmental neurotoxicity and alters a wide range of behavioral functions in mice. This shows the risk that mothers who abuse thinner paint expose their offspring...|$|R

40|$|Acetone is a {{component}} in many inhalants {{that have been}} widely <b>abused.</b> While other <b>solvents</b> have addictive potential, such as toluene, {{it is unclear whether}} acetone alone contains addictive properties. The locomotor, relative glucose metabolism and abusive effects of acetone inhalation were studied in animals using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm and [18 F] 2 -fluorodeoxy-D-glucose (18 FDG) imaging. The CPP apparatus contains two distinct conditioning chambers and a middle adaptation chamber, each lined with photocells to monitor locomotor activity. Adolescent Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 16; 90 - 110 g) were paired with acetone in least preferred conditioning chamber, determined on the pretest day. The animals were exposed to a 10, 000 ppm dose for an hour, alternating days with air. A CPP test was conducted after the 3 rd, 6 th and 12 th pairing. In these same animals, the relative glucose metabolism effects were determined using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with 18 FDG. Following the 3 rd pairing, there was a significant aversion to the acetone paired chamber (190. 9 ± 13. 7 sec and 241. 7 ± 16. 9 sec, acetone and air, respectively). After the 6 th pairing, there was no significant preference observed with equal time spent in each chamber (222 ± 21 sec and 207 ± 20 sec, acetone and air-paired, respectively). A similar trend was observed after the 12 th pairing (213 ± 21 sec and 221 ± 22 sec, acetone and air-paired, respectively). Locomotor analysis indicated a significant decrease (p< 0. 05) from air pairings to acetone pairings on the first and sixth pairings. The observed locomotor activity was characteristic of central nervous system (CNS) depressants, without showing clear abusive effects in this CPP model. In these studies, acetone vapors were not as reinforcing as other solvents, shown by overall lack of preference for the acetone paired side of the chamber. PET imaging indicated a regionally specific distribution of 18 FDG uptake following acetone exposure. Further studies using different concentrations are required to better understand the locomotor and behavioral effects of acetone. This study confirms that the combination of microPET and the CPP paradigm can be used to elucidate the effects of <b>abused</b> <b>solvents</b> vs. non-abused solvents in inhalants...|$|R
