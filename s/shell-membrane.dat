40|$|Very thin shells, <b>shell-{{membrane}}</b> and membrane structures offer high actuator {{authority for}} controlling their behaviour. On the other side, special care {{has to be}} taken for proper material and structural characterisation and its interaction with the actuators. In the paper different types of actuators are discussed in the context of precision <b>shell-membrane</b> space reflectors. For actuation, emphasis is given on piezo-ceramics and electro-active polymers. Special integration, modelling and testing techniques for smart fibre reinforced shell-membranes and membranes are addressed. A possible long term impact on som...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{physical}} characteristics of whole egg, yolk, albumen, and <b>shell-membrane</b> weights, {{as well as}} total dry matter and moisture content, were compared between Araucana and White Leghorn eggs at 1, 3, and 5 months into production. These characteristics were also re-gressed against their respective whole egg weights {{in order to make}} comparisons at equal egg size. When comparisons were made between eggs from hens of the same reproductive ages, albumen and <b>shell-membrane</b> weights were significantly heavier for the White Leghorns, but there were no differences in whole egg or yolk weights. All weights increased significantly in both breeds with reproductive age except for <b>shell-membrane</b> weights, which showed no change over the 5 -month study. Whole egg dry matter was significantly greater for the Araucana eggs, but there were no differ-ences in whole egg moisture content and in yolk or albumen dry matter. All of these characteristics increased significantly in both breeds with reproductive age except albumen dry matter, which decreased significantly. On an equal egg weight basis, typical Araucana eggs had 23 % more yolk, 9 % less albumen, 9 % less <b>shell-membrane,</b> 10 % more whole egg dry matter, and. 6 % less moisture than the White Leg-horn eggs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA novel <b>shell-membrane</b> {{concept is}} {{presented}} in this paper to define the wrinkling analytical object. A stress field model is established and applied to determine the different regions (taut, wrinkled and slack regions) of the <b>shell-membrane.</b> An analytical model based on the bifurcation theory of thin-plate is introduced to predict the wrinkling wavelength and amplitude. Numerical simulation incorporating nonlinear post-wrinkling analysis is employed to simulate the detailed nonlinear wrinkling behavior. To stabilize the finite element model, the initial prestress is introduced to the model at first. The out-of-plane disturbing forces are then applied to the model to initiate the wrinkling and complete the post-wrinkling analysis. Results from numerical simulation show good agreement with the analytical prediction...|$|E
40|$|New {{demands for}} space and earth {{observations}} drive {{the need for}} large apertures of 10 m and higher in telescopes. This requires new types of alternative lightweight and deployable primary reflector or lens concepts with aerial densities of < 3 kg/m 2. Some syntheses between optical and especially mechanical and material aspects for large planar photon sieves and non-imaging telescopes are discussed. Focus is put on large planar and highly perforated membranes for photon sieves and <b>shell-membrane</b> type deployable (parabolic) reflectors, respectively. The reflecting surface of the latter is composed of specific C-fiber reinforces silicone (CFRS) material. In addition to possible shape control, emphasis is also given to reflective coating of CFRS. Engineering challenges requiring future activities are identified. © 2013 CEAS. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{asymptotic}} behavior of one-dimensional functionals {{associated with the}} energy of a thin nonlinear elastic spherical shell {{in the limit of}} vanishing thickness (proportional to a small parameter) epsilon and under the assumption of radial deformations. The functionals are characterized by the presence of a nonlocal potential term and defined on suitable weighted functional spaces. The <b>shell-membrane</b> transition is studied at three different relevant scales. For each we give a compactness result and compute the Gamma-limit. In particular, we show that if the energies on a sequence of configurations scale as epsilon(3 / 2), then the limit configuration describes a (locally) finite number of transitions between the undeformed and the everted configurations of the shell. We also highlight a kind of "Gibbs phenomenon" by showing that nontrivial optimal sequences restricted between the undeformed and the everted configurations must have energy scaling of at least epsilon(4 / 3) ...|$|E

40|$|C. expansa eggs have a brittle {{calcareous}} shell {{composed of}} needle-like aragonite crystals which radiate from a central core to form conical shell units. The shell {{is attached to}} a multi-layered fibrous shell- membrane, the layers of which separate to form an air space {{at one end of the}} egg. Funnel-shaped pores occur at the junctions of some shell units. The shell is similar in thickness to that of comparable birds 2 ̆ 7 eggs but the shell membrane is three times thicker. Pores are less dense at the poles of the egg than at equatorial regions but even here they are much less dense than in birds 2 ̆ 7 eggs. Pore diameter is larger than in birds 2 ̆ 7 eggs but this is largely due to the funnel-shape of the pores. Water vapour conductance is six times higher in C. expansa eggs than in comparable birds 2 ̆ 7 eggs. This increase cannot be explained by a larger pore area but may result from water vapour conductance through cracks in the shell, which are frequently observed. The thicker <b>shell-membrane</b> may compensate for these cracks and the partial loss of the shell...|$|E
