40|$|This article {{provides}} some practical tips for dose optimization in computed radiography (CR). The article will {{not provide a}} comprehensive list of all factors that could be changed to optimize patient dose in CR examination. This article will also provide specific manufacturer examples that can be transferred to other manufacturers&# 039; CR systems. Due to the relatively large dynamic range of CR, stringent measures {{have to be put}} in place to ensure that patients are not being overexposed to ionizing radiation. Manufacturers of CR systems use dose indicators such as S-values, exposure index, and log-mean values to provide an indication of the ¿dose¿ received at the imaging plate. Manufacturers also provide a histogram analysis of the image pixel values. This histogram {{can also be used to}} evaluate the dose. The dose received at the imaging plate also has an effect on image quality. Radiographic factors of kV, mAs, and <b>source</b> <b>to</b> <b>image</b> <b>distance</b> affect the dose index, the histogram, and hence the image quality. These relationships will be reviewed and practical tips for dose optimization will be discussed...|$|E

Methods: Using a computed radiography (CR) system, an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom was positioned for an AP examination using the table bucky. SID was initially set at 110 cm, with tube potential set at a constant 75 kVp, with two outer chambers selected and a fine focal spot of 0. 6 mm.

40|$|Background: With {{increasing}} use {{of diagnostic}} X-ray machines across Lagos, South-West Nigeria, relevant international bodies have proposed the use of reference dose levels (RDLs) to help manage radiation dose to patients without compromising image quality. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the entrance surface dose (ESD) at third quartile (75 th percentile) in Lagos metropolis for normal adult radiographic examinations and to compare them with national and international established reference dose guidelines. Materials and Methods: One dedicated X-ray unit in each diagnostic center was used for this study denoted as H 1 -H 10. A noninvasive Unfors ThinX RAD kilovoltage (kVp) meter which served as the phantom (mimicked patient) was used for measurements. The ESDs were determined by placing the Unfors ThinX RAD kVp meter on the patient′s table bucky at a <b>source</b> <b>to</b> <b>image</b> <b>distance</b> (SID) of 100 cm and at the erect bucky at a SID of 180 cm. The peak tube kVp was varied at different milliampere seconds (mAs). Results : The mean ESD for adult postero-anterior (PA) chest, antero-posterior (AP) Abdomen and (AP) lumbar spine X-ray examination were 0. 603, 2. 57, and 2. 57 mGy, respectively. While the ESD for the third quartile for adult (PA) chest, (AP) abdomen, and (AP) lumbar spine X-ray examination among the ten X-ray centers were 0. 93, 2. 74, and 2. 47 mGy, respectively.

40|$|For film-based {{radiography}} {{the operator}} {{had to be}} exact {{in the selection of}} acquisition parameters or the image could easily become under- or over-exposed. By contrast, digital technology allows for a much greater tolerance of acquisition factor selection which would still give an image of acceptable diagnostic quality. In turn this greater tolerance allows for the operator to increase effective dose for little or no penalty in image quality. The {{purpose of this article is}} to determine how image quality and lesion visibility vary with effective dose (E) in order to identify how much overexposure could be tolerated within the radiograph. Using an anthropomorphic chest phantom with ground glass lesions we determined how perceptual image quality and E varied over a wide range of acquisition conditions. Perceptual image quality comprised of image quality and lesion visibility. E was calculated using Monte Carlo method; image quality was determined using a two alternative forced choice (2 AFC) method and the quality criteria were partly informed from European guidelines. Five clinicians with significant experience in image reading scored the images for quality (intraclass correlation coefficient 0. 869). Image quality and lesion visibility had a close correlation (R 2 > 0. 8). The tolerance for over-exposure, whilst still acquiring an image of acceptable quality, increases with decreasing kV and increasing <b>source</b> <b>to</b> <b>image</b> <b>distance</b> (SID). The maximum over-exposure factor (ratio of maximum E to minimum E that produce images of acceptable quality) possible was 139 (at 125 cm and 60 kV). Given the phantom had characteristics similar to the human thorax we propose that that potential for overexposure in a human whilst still obtaining an image of acceptable perceptual image quality is very high. Further research into overexposure tolerance and dose creep should be undertaken...|$|E
40|$|Coronary {{angiography}} is {{a procedure}} {{used in the}} diagnosis and intervention of coronary heart disease. The procedure is often {{considered one of the}} highest dose diagnostic procedures in clinical use. Despite this, there is minimal use of dosimeters within angiographic catheterisation laboratories due to challenges resulting from their implementation. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare entrance dose delivery across locally commissioned c-arms to assess the need for real-time dosimetry solutions during angiographic procedures. The secondary aim of this study was to establish a calibration method for the MOSkin dosimeter that accurately produces entrance dose values from the clinically sampled beam qualities and energies. The MOSkin is a real-time dosimeter used to measure the skin dose delivered by external radiation beams. The suitability of the MOSkin for measurements in the angiographic catheterisation laboratory was assessed. Measurements were performed using a 30 × 30 × 30 cm 3 PMMA phantom positioned at the rotational isocenter of the c-arm gantry. The MOSkin calibration factor was established through comparison of the MOSkin response to EBT 2 film response. Irradiation of the dosimeters was performed using several clinical beam qualities ranging in energy from 70 to 105 kVp. A total of four different interventional c-arm machines were surveyed and compared using the MOSkin dosimeter. The phantom was irradiated from a normal angle of incidence using clinically relevant protocols, field sizes and <b>source</b> <b>to</b> <b>image</b> detector <b>distance</b> values. The MOSkin was observed to be radiotranslucent to the c-arm beam in all clinical environments. The MOSkin response was reproducible to within 2 % of the average value across repeated measurements for each beam setting. There were large variations in entrance dose delivery to the phantom between the different c-arm machines with the highest observed cine-acquisition entrance dose rate measuring 326 % higher than the lowest measured cine-acquisition entrance dose rate and with the highest measured fluoroscopic entrance dose rate measuring 346 % higher than the lowest measured fluoroscopic entrance dose rate. This comparison of entrance dose delivery across local clinical c-arms demonstrated the disparity in entrance dose delivery across catheterisation laboratories and outlined a need for real-time dose monitoring systems for patients during angiographic procedures. Through use of our calibration method, an average MOSkin calibration of 7. 37 mV/cGy was established. The calibration method allowed entrance dose to be measured across a range of beam energies and beam qualities without the input of the c-arm beam characteristics. This calibration factor was proven to reproduce entrance dose values to within 5 % value of the reference dosimeter’s response, suggesting potential for further studies and utilisation of the dosimeter in this field...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityPanoramic {{photography}} is quite old, but {{is becoming increasingly}} important {{in the field of}} aerial photography. Due to increased efficiency of aircraft warning facilities and accuracy of anti-aircraft missles the problem of obtaining photographs for aerial reconnaissance and mapping and charting becomes extremely hazardous. The obvious solution is to fly higher and further away and to take oblique photographs. This doesn't seem to be difficult, at first glance, but the object to camera distance becomes extremely long, thereby reducing the scale of the photograph. Decreasing the scale of a photograph decreases its usability. The only way to keep a proper scale then, is to increase the focal length. Increasing the focal length increases the format size and the overall camera dimensions, and more important weight. Weight and size are at a premium in an aircraft and to combat this a folded optical system is coupled to a slit scan device which utilizes moving film. This reduces weight and size, but introduces other technical problems, which are presently being solved by the U. S. Air Force. Assuming that the panoramic camera is built and is operational suitable. A method of rectification must be devised in order to effectively utilize the photography. Three methods of rectification are discussed. First, a pancratic lens coupled to a slit scanning device. Second, a mechanical rectifier, utilizing moving film and paper. Third, a mathematical Solution. The pancratic lens-slit scan system tends to recreate the conditions in existence at the time of exposure. The Scheimpflug condition is neglected by selecting a slit width so small that the image remains within the focal range. During the exposure the images were in perfect focus from nadir to horizon, as the distances involved are considered to be infinity. But in rectifier the object <b>to</b> <b>image</b> <b>distance</b> varies from 4 feet at the nadir to 6 feet at 0 = 60 °. Therefore a lens system had to be designed to keep proper focus for all object <b>to</b> <b>image</b> <b>distances</b> and the proper magnification, (to insure the correct scale). These two variables are a function of the angle of scan (0). The basic design for this pancratic lens starts with selecting 2 lenses of 22 inch focal length and computing the movements necessary to accomplish the required magnifications and focal distances. It was found that this could be easily accomplished, but the final lens system would have to be designed by a competent lens designer and would be much more complicated, due to a aberration corrections. For proper illumination the filament of the light <b>source</b> has <b>to</b> move as a function of 0 in order <b>to</b> keep <b>imaged</b> onto the aperture. The effective f/no very nicely stayed approximately the same, 14. 75 to 17. 25, throughout all the lens movements. For overall illumination the speed of the scan has to vary to compensate for loss due to the inverse square law, due to tilting of the image plane, and due to increased density of negative toward the horizon. The second system, the mechanical system, consists of either a pancratic or a fixed lens system, with the negative moving past a slit and the image being projected down on a table onto moving paper. The moving parts that have to be calibrated are: the negative, printing paper, light source filament, 1 st projection lens, 2 nd projection lens, rotation of lens system, <b>image</b> <b>to</b> object <b>distance,</b> and tilt of easel. Most of these relationships are easy to compute and control, but the paper speed when determined will be difficult to control. As has been observed in the field, continuous printing devices do not operate efficiently in operational organizations. The third system, the mathematical solution, uses surfaces which were derived by trial and error after extensive mathematical research. This system can be proved, mathematically, not to be perfect. In fact the distortion has not been reduced less than 14 per cent. This is too much for reconnaissance and charting purposes. In view of the limitations of the various rectifiers it is felt that the pancratic lens-slit scan system would be the most practical rectifier for field use. If accepted for field use this pancratic lens system could eventually replace the current tri-metrago method of charting. The panoramic rectification system would eliminate many operations and specialized techniques and save money by reducing man-power requirements per chart...|$|R
