40|$|Recently EN 8 steel finding many {{applications}} in manufacturing of parts such as axle, shaft gear and fasteners {{due to their}} high tensile strength property. Optimum machining parameters of milling operations are great concern with manufacturing environment. In this experimental investigation was observed the machining performance with various cutting speed, feed and depth of cut using <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> milling <b>cutter.</b> Mainly surface roughness where investigated employing Taguchi design of experiments and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The significant machining parameters are identified by using signal to noise ratio. The result of the experiments indicates cutting speed play a dominating role in surface roughness in milling process parameters...|$|R
40|$|The cutting forces, tooth wear, surface finish, {{and cutting}} power were {{observed}} for 3 / 8 " x 3 " <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> milling <b>cutters</b> at {{two levels of}} cutting feed (2. 1 and 7. 7 in. /min.) and depth of cut (. 005 " and. 010 ") while cutting Inconel X- 750. [...] The investigation briefly traces the development of metal cutting science, pointing {{out some of the}} fallacies which have persisted to the present day. It proposes that metal to metal contact, and hence wear, be reduced by using a soft metal as a solid lubricant. Copper was eventually selected because of its electro-negative nature when compared to high speed steel. Copper is deposited continuously on the <b>face</b> <b>and</b> flank of milling cutter teeth by an electrolyte solution of copper sulphate and sulphuric acid. [...] The experiment consisted of three phases, the first being of a preliminary nature to evaluate the feasibility of depositing copper by this process. Measurements of cutting power for various depths of cut, using a mild steel work piece, were compared to those obtained using a soluble oil, with favourable results for the copper sulphate electrolyte. [...] Evaluation of the electrolyte cutting fluid to determine its optimum composition by measuring cutter wear, cutting forces, cutting power, and the surface finish of the work piece, follows. Observations of surface finish and cutting power produced no positive result. However, the other variables indicated a preference for a copper sulphate concentration of 11. 1 grams per litre of solution and a sulphuric acid concentration of 5 millilitres of concentrated acid per litre of solution. [...] The determination of the optimum composition of the copper based electrolyte was achieved using Inconel X- 750 as the work piece material. This grade of Inconel was also used in the third and final phase of the experiment, which was to compare the electrolyte cutting fluid with a conventional sulphurized cutting oil. Results of this comparison indicate that the conventional cutting oil, Veedol AFTON # 8 containing 1. 8 to 2 per cent sulphur, produces less wear at a lower wear rate than the copper sulphate solution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper adopts {{composite}} structure system analysis method to perform modal analysis of high-speed <b>face</b> milling <b>cutter</b> which {{is mounted on}} the machine tool through FEM modal analysis. The key problem of this method is to obtain joint surface parameters between the machine tool spindle <b>and</b> <b>face</b> milling <b>cutter</b> through experimental modal analysis and MATLAB software. The joint surface parameters consist of linear stiffness, linear damping, rotation stiffness and rotation damping. After getting the frequency response function (FRF) at the tool tip of the face milling system through experimental modal analysis, the contact surface parameters {{can be used to}} eliminate the influence of the machine tool to get modal parameters of the face-milling cutter itself. Based on the finite element model of <b>face</b> milling <b>cutter,</b> {{composite structure}} system analysis method can be used easily to acquire the dynamic performance of the face milling system through FEM modal analysis, greatly to improve the reliability of modal analysis, and is helpful to the dynamic design and the structure improvement of high speed <b>face</b> milling <b>cutter...</b>|$|R
