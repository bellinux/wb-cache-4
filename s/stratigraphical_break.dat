40|$|The {{outcrops}} of the « Quartzophyllades de Chevlipont » and the« Quartzophyllades de Villers-la-Ville » in {{both the}} Dyle and Thylevalleys, in the Province of Brabant, contain acritarch assemblages ofsixty-eight species and two subspecies. Four of the species are new : Micrhystridium pellitum, Vulcanisphaera flagellum, Impluviculus lenticularis and I. stellaris. These assemblages may be divided into threezones of late Cambrian to early Tremadocian, early Tremadocian, and Arenigian or Llanvirnian — more probably Llanvirnian — age, showingthat the « Assise » de Villers-la-Ville is younger than the « Assise » deMousty, from which it is separated by a <b>stratigraphical</b> <b>break...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{balance of}} {{evidence}} suggests that the mid Ludfordian positive carbon isotope excursion (CIE) commences in the Ludlow area, England in the uppermost Upper Whitcliffe Formation, with the excursion continuing into at least the Platyschisma Shale Member of the overlying Downton Castle Sandstone Formation. The Ludlow Bone Bed Member, {{at the base of the}} Downton Castle Sandstone Formation has previously been considered to be of Přídolí­ age. Conodont and thelodont evidence, however, are consistent with the mid Ludfordian age proposed here. New δ 13 C org data are presented from Weir Quarry, W of Ludlow, showing a pronounced positive excursion commencing in the uppermost Upper Whitcliffe Formation, in strata with a palynologically very strong marine influence. Elsewhere in the world, the mid Ludfordian positive CIE is associated with major facies changes indicated shallowing; the lithofacies evidence from the Ludlow area is consistent with this. There appears not to be a major <b>stratigraphical</b> <b>break</b> at the base of the Ludlow Bone Bed Member...|$|E
