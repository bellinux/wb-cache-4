2500|$|An Australian {{workplace}} agreement (AWA) was {{a type of}} formalised {{individual agreement}} negotiated between an employer and employee in Australia that existed for a <b>short</b> <b>number</b> {{of years in the}} 2000s. Employers could offer a [...] "take it or leave it" [...] AWA as a condition of employment. They were registered by the Employment Advocate and did not require a dispute resolution procedure. These agreements operated only at the federal level. AWAs were individual written agreements on terms and conditions of employment between an employer and employee in Australia, under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. An AWA could override employment conditions in state or territory laws except those relating to occupational health and safety, workers’ compensation, or training arrangements. An AWA was required to meet only the most minimal Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Agreements were not required to include effective dispute resolution procedures, and could not include prohibited content. Agreements were for a maximum of five years; approved, promoted and registered by the Workplace Authority; operated to the exclusion of any award; and prohibited industrial action regarding details in the agreement {{for the life of the}} agreement. The introduction of AWAs was a very controversial industrial relations issue in Australia.|$|E
