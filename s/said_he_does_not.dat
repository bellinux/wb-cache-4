5|$|During their investigation, Pembleton and Bayliss learn Kaja {{has been}} in a Haitian prison for four months, {{eliminating}} him as a lead. Gee announces the Baltimore Sun is running a story that Kaja has been cleared as a suspect, leaked from the police. Pembleton accuses Ballard and Gharty of leaking the story, while Gharty accuses Pembleton of going easy on Felix Wilson because he is a successful black man. The discussion prompts a heated argument with accusations of racism from both sides. Pembleton agrees to interview Felix Wilson alone because he believes it will clear him. When Pembleton tells Wilson he needs a blood test from him and his son, Wilson admits that he had consensual sex with Brierre the night of the murder, but <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> kill her. Later, a devastated Pembleton and Gee still insist he should not necessarily be treated as a suspect, much to the disbelief of Ballard and Gharty. The detectives are interrupted by Wilson's attorney, who says the family will not submit to a blood and hair test without a court order.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore Sun runs {{a front-page}} story accusing the {{homicide}} unit of fumbling the investigation and protecting the Wilsons based on their race. Under pressure form his superiors, Gee demands they solve the murder immediately. Pembleton admits privately to his wife Mary (Ami Brabson) that he let his personal feelings of respect for Felix Wilson {{get in the way}} of the investigation; he agrees to make them a central part of the investigation. After searching the Wilson house, the detectives find love letters written by Hal Wilson to Brierre. Pembleton questions Felix and Hal, who agree to talk only if their statements are not admissible in court. Pembleton confronts the Wilsons with the love letters, which Hal said he never had the courage to give to Brierre. Felix said he would not have had sex with Brierre if he had known, which Hal <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> believe. Felix demands the truth from Hal, who admits to killing Brierre in a jealous rage upon learning of her affair with his father.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Chris has a pimple on {{his face}} which he names “Doug.” Lois worries about Chris, as Doug tells Chris to make some mischief. He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint {{on the wall of}} the Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into his room and is going to punish him but Chris tells her that Doug <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have to listen to her. This outrages Lois, {{deciding}} to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman’s, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone has destroyed Mort’s entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke comes over for dinner to meet Brian’s family, Doug tells Chris to lift up Brooke’s shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been a hooker. He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman’s Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug says he could make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the dermatology clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use cortisone on Doug, finally taking him out.|$|E
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) trains a {{temporary}} worker Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) {{so that she}} can take her place when she goes on maternity leave. In the break room, the other workers discuss how attractive Cathy is and how excited they are to have her in the office. Pam, being well into her pregnancy, is sensitive about her looks and so becomes offended by their discussion. Most of them respond by assuring Pam that she is, if anything, more sexually attractive than before she was pregnant. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), however, argues that sexual attractiveness is a mostly objective quality and pregnant women cannot be sexually attractive, and accuses the others of lying to spare Pam's feelings. Troubled by Dwight's comments, Pam asks her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he finds the new temp attractive. Not wanting to upset his wife, Jim tells her that he does not find her replacement attractive, even objectively. Though Jim gives no sign of unease, Pam is convinced that he is lying to her, and enlists the help of the harshly honest Dwight to prove it. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to trick Jim into revealing he finds Pam's replacement attractive, Dwight and Pam convince Jim to submit to a lie detection test {{in the form of a}} retail store's blood pressure tester. At the conclusion of the interview, Dwight triumphantly announces that he recorded hypertension when Jim <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> find the new temp attractive, but as Jim continues to insist he is telling the truth Dwight admits that he recorded equal hypertension on every question, including Jim's name. Pam realizes that Jim has unusually high blood pressure, which his father also suffers from, and forgets about the issue in order to focus on her husband's health.|$|E

25|$|Allen {{auditioned for}} the lead role in the 2012 musical film Rock of Ages, but lost the role to Diego Boneta.

Two of the next bullets struck Lennon in {{the left side of his}} back, and the other two penetrated his left shoulder.|$|E
500|$|John Glover characterizes Lionel as a {{businessman}} who is disappointed with his son. To Glover, Lionel is this [...] "rich and powerful businessman" [...] who sees his son as a [...] "wuss" [...] and [...] "fraidy-cat". It was important to Glover that Lionel appear as human as possible; Glover <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> want to simply [...] "twirl [...] mustache". Glover described Lionel {{as a man who}} will do whatever he needs to do to get what he wants. He characterizes Lionel as an intelligent man who can read people easily. Lionel uses that ability to further his goals. The character can also get past people's defenses and manipulate them. Glover thinks that type of power would be great if it could be used to help someone other than Lionel. Lionel's character is also connoted by the color scheme that surrounds him; the use of cold blue tones helps to evoke the [...] "sinister" [...] nature of the character. Lionel is also often portrayed in front of a white or [...] "clinical blue" [...] background. Lionel's signature mane of hair is used to symbolize his power—by growing it out and refusing to style it, Lionel attempts to show he is so powerful that he can do whatever he wants without any backlash.|$|E

500|$|... 20th Century Fox saw X-Men: First Class as {{the first}} film of a new X-Men trilogy. Donner {{compared}} the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, [...] "First Class is similar to Batman Begins, {{where you have the}} fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just get on with it and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight". Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, [...] "I {{thought it would be fun}} to open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto". Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about [...] "changing history" [...] in an interview with Empire magazine. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> want people to panic about events in the past [...] "erasing" [...] the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.|$|E
500|$|Tony Norman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette {{praised the}} episode, {{which he said}} [...] "has wandered {{into the heart of}} Dostoyevsky {{territory}} with its storylines". He particularly praised the episode for going outside its normal conventions by portraying lead characters like Pembleton and Gee as being so reluctant to do the right thing. Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News gave the episode four out of five stars; he particularly praised the performances of Thorne and Gerety, and said the show did an impressive job of introducing the new cast members. Michael Storey of Arkansas Democrat-Gazette said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] lived up to the high standards he said the show had set for itself. Ron Miller of Fort Worth Star-Telegram praised [...] "Blood Ties", although he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> always enjoy Homicide: Life on the Street. He said the episode [...] "starts fast and gets better and more intense by the minute", and described the climactic argument in the second episode as [...] "the most turbulent internal dispute we've ever seen among the detectives". Rocky Mountain News writer Dusty Saunders praised the main story-line and said the subplots were well juxtaposed into the episode. He also said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] could serve as a good introduction to the series for new viewers. Alan Sepinwall, television critic for The Star-Ledger, criticized the addition of [...] "silly" [...] action-oriented scenes the traditionally more intelligent show, but praised [...] "Blood Ties" [...] and the addition of the new cast members. Sepinwall particularly praised the acting of Andre Braugher: [...] "Pitted against a powerhouse like James Earl Jones, he not only holds his own, but at times is so dramatically forceful that the former voice of Darth Vader sounds intimidated." [...] Not all reviews of [...] "Blood Ties" [...] were positive. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post said the series benefited from the new characters, but that the episode [...] "asks viewers to believe rather too strongly in the inherent racism of certain characters we've come to know as heroes in seasons past". Ostrow also thought Pembleton's clashes with the new detectives was predictable.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2011 Cain <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{believe in}} the concept of [...] "too big to fail" [...] and has stated that he did not agree with the bailouts of [...] "JP Morgan and the big banks on Wall Street".|$|E

2500|$|Accusing the United States of {{supporting}} the opposition governors and attempting to overthrow his government, Morales declared the United States Ambassador to Bolivia Philip Goldberg persona non grata, and ordered {{him to leave the}} country. The U.S. responded by expelling Bolivia's ambassador in Washington. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack expressed regret at the diplomatic fallout saying it will [...] "prejudice the interests of both countries, undermine the ongoing fight against drug trafficking and will have serious regional implications." [...] President Morales <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> want to break diplomatic ties with the U.S. but said the actions of the ambassador were [...] "very serious", claiming he met with provincial leaders and instigated the unrest. Before his departure the American ambassador warned Bolivia that it would face [...] "serious consequences" [...] and had [...] "not correctly evaluated" [...] the retaliation from Washington.|$|E
