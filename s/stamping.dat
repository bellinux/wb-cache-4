5|$|A few early issued {{items were}} {{embossed}} but generally the post-paid impressed stamps were typographed. The Revenue <b>Stamping</b> Branch, Dublin Castle, applied the impressed indicia until 1984, when An Post employed the typographic printing method.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stamps</b> on <b>stamps</b> is a philatelic {{term for}} {{depicting}} images of postage <b>stamps</b> on postage <b>stamps.</b> Some postage <b>stamp</b> collectors have specialized in collecting <b>stamps</b> on <b>stamps</b> as a topical collection.|$|R
5000|$|While one of {{the most}} popular brand of trading <b>stamps</b> in the United States were the S&H Green <b>Stamps,</b> informally known as [...] "green stamps", other larger brands {{included}} Top Value <b>Stamps,</b> Gold Bond <b>Stamps,</b> Plaid <b>Stamps,</b> Blue Chip <b>Stamps,</b> Buccaneer <b>Stamps</b> and Gold Strike <b>Stamps.</b> Texas Gold <b>Stamps</b> were given away in their namesake state mainly by the H-E-B grocery store chain and Mahalo <b>stamps</b> in Hawaii.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stamp</b> catalogs like Scott's Standard Postage <b>Stamp</b> Catalog (SC) often {{document}} the paper the <b>stamp</b> is printed {{on to describe}} a <b>stamp's</b> classification. The same <b>stamp</b> design can appear on several kinds of paper. <b>Stamp</b> collectors and philatelists understand that a <b>stamp's</b> paper not only defines a unique <b>stamp</b> but could also {{mean the difference between}} an inexpensive <b>stamp</b> from one that is rare and worth more than its common counterpart.|$|R
5|$|Known as the <b>stamping</b> privilege, companies, {{associations}} and individuals {{were permitted to}} submit their own designed and pre-printed envelopes, cards, letter sheets, etc., to the Irish Post Office for impressing with an official post-paid indicia. Window envelopes were popular for printed matter rate mail. The most prolific user was the Electricity Supply Board which used meter reading and appointment cards for over forty years. Stamped-to-order postal stationery users included Blackrock College, Córas Iompair Éireann, Esso, Great Northern Railway, and John Player & Sons, Dublin. No stamped-to-order registered envelopes are known. Apparently An Post have withdrawn the <b>stamping</b> privilege without any public notice, because stamped-to-order postal stationery has seldom been seen since An Post {{took control of the}} Irish Post Office in 1984, with only five users recorded by Jung. Between 1963 and 2000 a few philatelically influenced items are known produced by six users.|$|E
5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} <b>stamping</b> {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E
5|$|Flock {{behaviour}} in sheep {{is generally}} only exhibited {{in groups of}} four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep. Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered. Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof <b>stamping</b> and adopting an aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.|$|E
50|$|A {{cigarette}} tax <b>stamp</b> is any adhesive <b>stamp,</b> metered <b>stamp,</b> {{heat transfer}} <b>stamp,</b> or other form or evidence of payment of a cigarette tax. A cigarette tax <b>stamp</b> {{is a specific}} example of a revenue <b>stamp.</b>|$|R

5|$|Similar alloys {{with the}} {{addition}} of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make <b>stamping</b> dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.|$|E
5|$|They stamp {{their feet}} {{in time to the}} hornpipe – that is until I whip up the {{orchestra}} to a fierce accelerando which leaves behind all those whose <b>stamping</b> technique is not of the very finest quality. I like to win by two bars, if possible; but sometimes have to be content with a bar and a half. It is good fun, and I enjoy it as much as they.|$|E
5|$|Independence grew {{quickly when}} more gold {{was found in}} the nearby mountains. Within two years of its {{settlement}} permanent buildings had replaced the original tents, and a mining concern from Leadville had bought up all the claims. In two years they produced gold worth $190,000 ($ in modern dollars), funding the construction of a <b>stamping</b> mill and sawmill. In Aspen, further down the valley, silver was found in even greater abundance than Independence's gold. B. Clark Wheeler, an early investor in those mines, funded the construction of a stage road to Leadville, the first road to cross the pass. It opened in November 1881, with winter already in full swing at the pass.|$|E
50|$|Mint <b>stamps</b> {{are often}} more {{valuable}} than used <b>stamps</b> as in many cases fewer mint <b>stamps</b> survive. A mint <b>stamp</b> may also be in better condition than a used <b>stamp</b> which has passed through the mail. Sometimes, however, used <b>stamps</b> may be more valuable than mint ones where higher numbers of mint <b>stamps</b> have survived, perhaps because large numbers of mint <b>stamps</b> were bought by collectors but few used on letters.|$|R
50|$|Topical or {{thematic}} <b>stamp</b> collecting is the collecting of postage <b>stamps</b> {{relating to}} a particular subject or concept. Topics can be almost anything, from <b>stamps</b> on <b>stamps,</b> birds, trains and poets on <b>stamps,</b> to famous physicians and scientists, along with historical people and events on <b>stamps,</b> which is often a standard theme for many <b>stamp</b> issuing countries.|$|R

5|$|On 4 November 2005, Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Glenn Hoddle accused Carlisle of <b>stamping</b> on goalkeeper Michael Oakes in {{the match}} the {{previous}} weekend, {{and threatened to}} report him to the Football Association. However, the referee did not show Carlisle a red or yellow card during the match, and no further action was taken against the player. During the 2005–06 campaign, Carlisle made 35 appearances and five three goals, helping Watford to achieve {{a place in the}} play-offs after finishing third in the Championship. However, {{towards the end of the}} season he suffered yet another injury, being forced off the pitch in Watford's penultimate league match away at Queens Park Rangers. The thigh problem caused him to be unavailable for the play-offs as Watford defeated Leeds 3–0 at the Millennium Stadium to win promotion to the FA Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Special {{behavioral}} {{features of}} the dromedary include snapping at others without biting them and showing displeasure by <b>stamping</b> their feet. They are generally non-aggressive, {{with the exception of}} rutting males. They appear to remember their homes; females in particular remember the places they first gave birth or suckled their offspring. Males become aggressive in the mating season, and sometimes wrestle. A 1980 study showed androgen levels in males influences their behaviour. Between January and April when these levels are high during the rut, they become difficult to manage, blow out the palate from the mouth, vocalise and throw urine over their backs. Camels scratch parts of their bodies with their legs or with their lower incisors. They may also rub against tree bark and roll in sand.|$|E
5|$|The Atlanta Journal {{wrote that}} {{a crowd of}} men, women, and {{children}} arrived on foot, in cars, and on horses, and that souvenir hunters cut away parts of his shirt sleeves. According to The New York Times, one of the onlookers, Robert E. Lee Howellrelated to Clark Howell, editor of The Atlanta Constitutionwanted to have the body cut into pieces and burned, and began to run around, screaming, whipping up the mob. Judge Newt Morris tried to restore order, {{and asked for a}} vote on whether the body should be returned to the parents intact; only Howell disagreed. When the body was cut down, Howell started <b>stamping</b> on Frank's face and chest; Morris quickly placed the body in a basket, and he and his driver John Stephens Wood drove it out of Marietta.|$|E

50|$|Ma's {{first edition}} {{catalogue}} listed <b>stamps</b> under a numbering system now universally {{recognized as the}} Ma's catalogue number (馬氏編號). Numbers without a preceding letter are regular issues of the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China. An Alphabet Letter preceding a <b>stamp</b> number denotes special purpose <b>stamps</b> or territorial <b>stamps</b> such as Provincial Overprints, Air Mail <b>stamps,</b> and Postage Due <b>stamps.</b> Letters following the <b>stamp</b> number are <b>stamp</b> errors and other special varieties.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>stamp</b> {{depicting}} {{an aeroplane}} was a US 20-cent parcel post <b>stamp</b> issued on 1 January 1913 but not intended for airmail duty: {{the set of}} 12 showed transportation and delivery methods. Four years later an airmail <b>stamp</b> was issued in Italy. Several of the early ones were produced by surcharging other <b>stamps</b> with overprints; at first in 1917, Italy used express stamps; regular <b>stamps</b> were used by Austria in 1918, Sweden used official <b>stamps</b> in 1920. Some other examples are the use of fiscal <b>stamps,</b> telegraph <b>stamps,</b> postage due <b>stamps,</b> and parcel <b>stamps</b> by other countries. Airmail <b>stamps</b> have been issued for extra services, such as registered airmail, express airmail, airmail fieldpost, and even with welfare surcharges.|$|R
5|$|The Collections {{include a}} unique proof sheet of 26 Revenue 1765 Newspaper and Pamphlet one penny {{impressions}} showing the registration certificate, {{held in the}} Board of Inland Revenue <b>Stamping</b> Department Archive. These were issued to apply the Stamp Act of 1765 intended to raise taxes to fund the defence of the American Colonies from the French. The tax applied to legal documents, licences, newspapers, pamphlets and almanacs in the American Colonies, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Florida, the Bahamas and the West Indian Islands. The taxes resulted in public protest and rioting. The tax was abandoned {{after a few months}} due to its unpopularity but the political damage contributed to the War of Independence in 1775.|$|E
5|$|At the New York–Pennsylvania {{border in}} Ripley, PA5 becomes NY5 upon {{entering}} New York. It very closely follows {{the shore of}} Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County. Once reaching the village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY438 where the roads once again split. Once in Erie County it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of Wanakah. Once past Wanakah, the road once again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas, particularly the Ford <b>Stamping</b> Plant and the Bethlehem Steel plant {{in the city of}} Lackawanna where the road is called the Hamburg Turnpike and eight wind powered turbines, which pump power into the national grid are visible. Near the northern edge of the city, NY5 begins to ascend onto an elevated roadway as it connects to Ridge Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange. Here, the route becomes the Buffalo Skyway, a limited-access highway with exits for Ohio and Tifft streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard. After a quarter-mile, NY5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{domestic}} decoration, Han artwork {{also served}} an important funerary function. Han artists and craftsmen decorated the wall bricks lining underground tombs {{of the deceased}} with mural paintings and carved reliefs; {{the purpose of this}} artwork was to aid the deceased in traveling through their afterlife journey. <b>Stamping</b> artistic designs into tile and brick was also common. Human figurine sculptures found in Han tombs were placed there to perform various functions for the deceased in the afterlife, such as dancing and playing music for entertainment, as well as serving food. A common type of ceramic figurine found in Han tombs is a female entertainer sporting long, flowing silk sleeves that are flung about while dancing. Some ceramic human figures—both male and female—have been found naked, all with clearly distinguished genitalia and missing arms. This is because they once had wooden or cloth arms which were attached to holes in the shoulders by pegs, as well as miniature clothes made of perishable materials such as silk.|$|E
50|$|Business <b>stamps</b> are {{generally}} available from stationers or direct from the manufacturer.

5|$|Music, {{dance and}} singing {{are part of}} many a Kanak {{ceremonial}} function such as initiation, courting and mourning. Conch shells are blown by an appointed person to represent a clan chief’s arrival or the voice of an ancestor. Rhythm instruments used include Bwanjep, used during ceremonies {{by a group of}} men; Jew's harp, (wadohnu in the Nengone language where it originated) made of dried piece of coconut palm leaf held between the teeth and an attached segment of soft nerve leaf; coconut-leaf whizzer, a piece of coconut leaf attached to a string and twirled that produces a noise like a humming bee; oboe, made of hollow grass stems or bamboo; end-blown flute, made of 50cm long hollowed pawpaw leaf stem; bamboo <b>stamping</b> tubes that are struck vertically against the ground and played at major events; percussion instruments (hitting sticks, palm sheaths); rattles that are worn on the legs made of coconut leaves, shells and certain fruits. Kanak groups such as Bethela first made the recordings on cassette around 1975 or 1976.|$|E
5|$|There are few native natural predators of emus still alive. Early in its species history it {{may have}} faced {{numerous}} terrestrial predators now extinct, including the giant lizard Megalania, the thylacine, and possibly other carnivorous marsupials, which may explain their seemingly well-developed ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predators. The main predator of emus today is the dingo, which was originally introduced by Aboriginals {{thousands of years ago}} from a stock of semi-domesticated wolves. Dingoes try to kill the emu by attacking the head. The emu typically tries to repel the dingo by jumping into the air and kicking or <b>stamping</b> the dingo on its way down. The emu jumps as the dingo barely has the capacity to jump high enough to threaten its neck, so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo's lunge can keep its head and neck out of danger.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Bhimsen {{was able}} to {{continue}} making all the administrative decisions of the country, while the Regent Queen Tripurasundari would unquestioningly approve these decisions by <b>stamping</b> the royal seal issued {{in the name of}} King Rajendra on these government orders. The Regent never dared to express any doubts regarding Bhimsen's decisions. Nevertheless, {{to make sure that the}} King, his wives – Samrajya Laxmi Devi (senior) and Rajya Lakshmi Devi (junior) – and the Regent were insulated from influences of people other than Bhimsen and his closest relatives, Bhimsen had instated his youngest brother, General Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the royal palace to keep a watch on the royal family and to keep guard against any outside person. Any priest or courtier who wished to be granted an interview with the King, the Queens, or the Regent, had to get an approval from Ranbir Singh and the interview had to be conducted under his watchful presence. Similarly, the royal family were not allowed to leave the palace without Bhimsen's permission either. Bhimsen had also neglected the formal education of Rajendra, due to which he had grown to be uncritical and weak minded to the extent that he was even unaware that he was virtually a prisoner. However, his wives were more alert and wary of Bhimsen since, according to Baburam Acharya, they received unfiltered news of the world outside the royal palace from their handmaidens, who would leave the palace compounds and go to their homes during their menstruation and gather news and rumors of the day, which they would then relate to the Queens.|$|E
