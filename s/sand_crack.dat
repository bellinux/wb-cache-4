40|$|A complex {{variety of}} casts of sand cracks occurs at two study areas near Pretoria, with in mature, thin {{sandstone}} beds of the c. 2. 1 Ga Magaliesberg Formation (Pretoria Group, Transvaal Supergroup). This formation is ascribed to deposition within the littoral, sandy portions of a low-energy epeiric sea, then covering {{much of the}} Transvaal preservational basin. Reticulate networks of these <b>sand</b> <b>crack</b> casts (which equate to petee ridges) and leaser vermiform geometries, the latter commonly associated with ripple troughs (. cf. Mancburiophycus), reflect a degree of cohesiveness which is difficult to envisage in sands unless there were either thin muddy inteH 3 ed. s between sandy strata, or the sandy beds were bound by microbial mats growing in their upper portions. In {{the absence of any}} observed mudstone interbeds, a genetic role for microbial mats can be supported. Several of these inferred microbially-induced sand cracks appear to have "healed", presumably having become overgrown by re-establishment of a new mat following partial desiccation of an earlier one. Associated "oncolites", found at one of the sites, confirm this general model of microbially-mediated "sand-cracking" having taken place. Such microbial mat features appear to be relatively widespread within the Magaliesberg Formation, most likely reflecting the shallow epeiric marine palaeoenvironment which would have favoured their preservation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Claw {{disorders}} are important traits relevant to dairy cattle breeding from an economical and welfare point of view. Selection for reduced claw disorders can {{be based on}} hoof trimmer records. Typically, not all cows in a herd are trimmed. Our objectives were to estimate heritabilities and genetic correlations for claw disorders and investigate the effect of selecting cows for trimming. The data set contained 50, 238 cows, of which 20, 474 cows {{had at least one}} claw trimming record, with a total of 29, 994 records. Six claw trimmers scored 14 different claw disorders: abscess (AB), corkscrew claw (CC), (inter-) digital dermatitis or heel erosion (DER), double sole (DS), hardship groove (HG), interdigital hyperplasia (IH), interdigital phlegmon (IP), <b>sand</b> <b>crack</b> (SC), super-foul (SF), sole hemorrhage (SH), sole injury (SI), sole ulcer (SU), white line separation (WLS), yellow discoloration of the sole (YD), and a combined claw disorder trait. Frequencies of the claw disorders for trimmed cows ranged from 0. 1 % (CC, YD, HG) to 23. 8 % (DER). More than half of the cows scored had at least one claw disorder. Heritability on the observed scale ranged from 0. 02 (DS, SH) to 0. 14 (IH) and on the underlying scale from 0. 05 to 0. 43 in trimmed cows. Genetic correlations between laminitis-related claw disorders were moderate to high, and the same was found for hygiene-related claw disorders. The effect of selecting cows for trimming was first investigated by including untrimmed cows in the analyses and assuming they were not affected by claw disorders. Heritabilities on the underlying scale showed only minor changes. Second, different subsets of the data were created based on the percentage of trimmed cows in the herd. Heritabilities for IH, DER, and SU tended to decrease when a higher percentage of cows in the herd were trimmed. Finally, a bivariate model with a claw disorder and the trait “trimming status” was used, but heritabilities were similar. Heritability for trimming status was relatively high (0. 09). Genetic correlations of trimming status with claw disorders were generally moderate to high. To conclude, the effect of selecting cows for trimming on the heritability for claw disorders is negligible. Selecting herds with a high fraction of cows being trimmed tended to decrease heritability. Trimming status, as such, is a heritable trait and correlated with claw disorders and is therefore an interesting trait to include in the genetic evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Van der Spek, D. (2015). Genetic {{background}} of claw health in dairy cattle. PhD thesis, Wageningen University, the Netherlands. Claw disorders affect cow welfare and profitability of farms {{and as such}} are important traits relevant to dairy cattle breeding. Aim of this thesis was to increase {{our understanding of the}} genetic {{background of}} claw disorders to enable selection for reduced claw disorder incidence. The claw disorders were: abscess, corkscrew claw, (inter-) digital dermatitis or heel erosion (DER), double sole (DS), hardship groove, interdigital hyperplasia (IH), interdigital phlegmon, <b>sand</b> <b>crack,</b> super-foul, sole hemorrhage (SH), sole injury, sole ulcer (SU), white line separation (WLS), and yellow discoloration of the sole. Data was collected on Holstein cows kept in dairy herds in France. Individual claw disorder frequencies ranged from 0. 1 % to 23. 8 % {{and more than half of}} the trimmed cows had at least one claw disorder in at least one hind leg between 2007 and 2012. Heritabilities were estimated for DER, DS, IH, SH, SU, and WLS, and ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 14. Repeatabilities ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 33. The need for trimming (“trimming status”) was found to be heritable as well with a heritability of 0. 09. A high need for trimming the claws of cows is unfavorable and therefore trimming status is an interesting trait to include in genetic evaluation. Most claw health traits had similar heritabilities and were genetically the same trait in different parities, lactation stages and herds with different trait frequencies. Claw disorder frequency in Montbeliarde cows ranged from 9. 4 % to 41. 1 % and 73 % of the cows had at least one claw disorder in at least one hind leg between 2007 and 2013. Heritabilities ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 09. Heritability for trimming status was 0. 06, confirming that trimming status is a heritable trait. To identify genomic regions associated with claw disorders and trimming status, a genome wide association study was performed. In total, 11 significant and 46 suggestive SNP were detected. Three of the suggestive SNP could be validated using a dataset of genotyped bulls. The detected SNP were spread across the genome and a major gene was not found. In the general discussion, alternative ways of measuring claw disorders were discussed. Accuracy of progeny testing and genomic selection for claw disorders was compared and a breeding program to reduce claw disorders was simulated in order to estimate selection response. Reducing the incidence of claw disorders is achievable with selection, but at a cost of a decrease in production.  ...|$|E

40|$|The Paleoproterozoic Gordon Lake and Bar River formations, Huronian Supergroup, {{contain a}} variety of {{sedimentary}} structures in the Flack Lake area of Ontario, Canada, that have been considered of debatable origin. We identify these structures as microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS). The preserved MISS are related to microbial mat destruction and decay, and include <b>sand</b> <b>cracks,</b> mat chips, remnant gas domes, pyrite patches, and iron laminae. A biological origin for the fossil structures is supported by their similarities to modern and ancient documented examples of MISS, the sand-dominated nature of the substrate {{in which they are}} preserved, and key microtextures identified in thin section. Microtextures include curled, frayed and layered mat chips, carbonaceous laminae, oriented grains, and concentrated heavy minerals. On outcrop scale, the presence of desiccation cracks, flaser and lenticular bedding, and ripples in association with the types of MISS identified in the Gordon Lake Formation support the interpretation of a tidal flat depositional environment. The Gordon Lake Formation contains a greater number and diversity of MISS than the overlying Bar River Formation, as a result of lower energy deposition in the former. The quartz arenite of the Bar River Formation contains fine-grained to pebbly granulestone characterized mainly by tangential and planar cross beds, which is consistent with a tidal channel or sand shoal setting. Although fossil evidence of life is rare in the rocks of the Huronian Supergroup, identification of MISS in the Flack Lake area provides a significant and convincing indication of microbial colonization at the time of deposition...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of patchy preservation of ripples and of palimpsest ripples on many sandstone bed {{surfaces of the}} c. 2. 1 Ga Magaliesberg Formation (Pretoria Group, Transvaal Supergroup), South Africa, suggests that microbial mats grew within the upper parts of sandy deposits of the braid-deltaic-tidally controlled epeiric marine coastline palaeoenvironment inferred for this stratigraphic unit. Recently, limited occurrences of petee ridges, <b>cracked</b> <b>sand</b> layers, "elephant skin textures", wrinkle structures and "Manchuriophycus"-like cracks have been found, substantiating the envisaged role for microbial mats, binding sandy sediment and providing cohesion during active sedimentation by fluvial and tidal processes. Ripple marks associated with most of these biogenic sedimentary structures enable evaluation of genetic processes for the ripples (currents, waves, wind) as well as estimation of wave heights and water depths (cf. Tanner, W. F., 1967. Ripple mark indices and their uses. Sedimentology 9, 89 - 104. Tanner, W. F., 1971. Numerical estimates of ancient waves, water depths and fetch. Sedimentology 16, 71 - 88.). The petee ridges are interpreted as reflecting spring low tidal desiccation which cracked the mats, followed by disruption of sand beneath the mat due to loading from incoming tides or subsequent deposits. Slightly sinuous <b>sand</b> <b>cracks</b> on ripple crests are related to a similar combination of low tidal desiccation (and formation of wind ripples) with subsequent high tides providing the deeper water conditions and larger wave heights calculated from the (Tanner, W. F., 1971. Numerical estimates of ancient waves, water depths and fetch. Sedimentology 16, 71 - 88.) formula. Synaeresis cracking is inferred for both "elephant skin" cracks and "Manchuriophycus" structures. These inferred suspect-microbial sedimentary structures, when studied in relation to data derived from associated ripples, thus enable better estimation of depositional conditions within the Magaliesberg palaeoenvironment, and indicate minimum epeiric tidal ranges of c. 112 cm. In general, these structures are found associated with evidence for shallower water and higher energy conditions, which probably protected the microbial mats from degradation by heterotrophic bacteria, through fast burial. A possible association of such mat-related structures with epeiric marine or passive margin coastline conditions may be pertinent {{for much of the}} Precambrian clastic record. (c) 200...|$|R
40|$|The MRS/MISS of the Makgabeng Formation {{encompasses}} <b>sand</b> <b>cracks,</b> wrinkle marks, mat fragments, mat {{chips and}} roll-ups {{and those of}} the Magaliesberg formation are wrinkle marks, petees/petee ridges, <b>sand</b> <b>cracks,</b> and multi-directional ripples. The sedimentary process that moderated the formational mechanism of the MISS of the Makgabeng Formation is (descriptively allochthonous) of high energy (inter-dune depositional setting) that eroded, transported and re-deposited mat bound sediments. The genetic mechanism of the MISS of the Magaliesberg Formation is descriptively authochthonous because of enhanced resistance of biostabilized sediments to being reworked. XRF (major and trace) and XRD analysis (qualitative and quantitative) was done on MISS bearing sedimentary rock layers (A) and underlying sedimentary sections (B) of Magaliesberg and Makgabeng samples. Result show high quartz content of all the analyzed samples compared to average sandstones. This premise suggests a relation of microbes (e. g. cyanobacteria) to phototrophy and/photoautotrophy because of the conduction properties of translucent quartz. Also plausible inference is that the intense chemical weathering that produced the quartz arenite was positively influenced by microbes, as noted in some Proterozoic basins. There is higher concentration of Ba in all A samples compared to B (Makgabeng and Magaliesberg) which might be emblematic of biogenicity. The Magaliesberg analyzed samples (MAG 101, 102, 103) exhibit homogeneity by the higher concentration of Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, K 2 O, and P 2 O 5, and lower concentration of SiO 2 in the A compared to the B subsamples of a particular sample. Also, Magaliesberg analyzed samples (MAG 101, 102, 103) exhibit homogeneity by the lower concentration of quartz and higher concentration of muscovite in the A compared to the B subsamples. This exact established negative correlation between the duo of SiO 2 and quartz, and the quartet of Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, K 2 O, and P 2 O 5, and muscovite as in Magaliesberg samples pertains also to a Makgabeng sample (MKG 102; roll-up). MKG 101 (mat fragment) deviates from this mineralogical and geochemical trend. Each of the A samples of MAG 101, 102, 103, are uniformly of higher concentration in Ce, Cr, Nb, Th, V, Y, Zn, Zr compared to the B version of that sample. MKG 101 and 102 are uniformly of lower concentration of Ce, Cr, Nb, Th, V, Y, Zn, Zr in A compared to the B version of that sample. The A of each of the samples MAG 101, 102, and 103 has higher concentration of Hf and Rb compared to its B; a character that is also exhibit in MKG 102, and MKG 101 is vice versa. Microscopy shows that A of all the samples is of smaller grain size compared to B, espousing affinity of microbes to fine-medium grained sandstones. Microscopy of the Magaliesberg Formation samples show Pseudo petee ridges and pseudo cross lamination which reflect biostabilization, and microscopy of the Makgabeng Formation show roll-ups, mat chips and composite mat chips. The MISS genetic difference of the two formations is related to energy, water residence time (emergence and inundation), Ph, and similarity is related to mutuality in shallow water environment. Mat types are inferred to be biologically, physically and chemically moderated adaptations of microbial communities to specific cum peculiar locally prevailing environmental conditions; factors that are premised on taphonomy and ecology.

The alternative of bore piles as underpinning were selected by considering the field problems, such as the elongated soil <b>crack</b> <b>sand</b> a very steep slope of soil near the construction...|$|R
40|$|The two 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs), in {{combination}} with the Athena Payload, will be used as virtual instrument systems to infer terrain properties during traverses, in addition to using the rover wheels to excavate trenches, exposing subsurface materials for remote and in-situ observations. The MERs are being modeled using finite element-based rover system transfer functions that utilize the distribution of masses associated with the vehicle, together with suspension and wheel dynamics, to infer surface roughness and mechanical properties from traverse time series data containing vehicle yaw, pitch, roll, encoder counts, and motor currents. These analyses will be supplemented with imaging and other Athena Payload measurements. The approach is being validated using Sojourner data, the FIDO rover, and experiments with MER testbed vehicles. In addition to conducting traverse science and associated analyses, trenches will be excavated by the MERs to depths of approximately 10 - 20 cm by locking {{all but one of the}} front wheels and rotating that wheel backwards so that the excavated material is piled up on the side of the trench away from the vehicle. Soil cohesion and angle of internal friction will be determined from the trench telemetry data. Emission spectroscopy and in-situ observations will be made using the Athena payload before and after imaging. Trenching and observational protocols have been developed using Sojourner results; data from the FIDO rover, including trenches dug into <b>sand,</b> mud <b>cracks,</b> and weakly indurated bedrock; and experiments with MER testbed rovers. Particular attention will be focused on Mini-TES measurements designed to determine the abundance and state of subsurface water (e. g. hydrated, in zeolites, residual pore ice?) predicted to be present from Odyssey GRS/NS/HEND data...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the failure}} {{behaviors}} of debris flows were studied by flume model tests with artificial rainfall and numerical simulations (PFC 3 D). Model tests revealed that grain sizes distribution had profound effects on failure mode, {{and the failure}} in slope of medium <b>sand</b> started with <b>cracks</b> at crest and {{took the form of}} retrogressive toe sliding failure. With the increase of fine particles in soil, the failure mode of the slopes changed to fluidized flow. The discrete element method PFC 3 D can overcome the hypothesis of the traditional continuous medium mechanic and consider the simple characteristics of particle. Thus, a numerical simulations model considering liquid-solid coupled method has been developed to simulate the debris flow. Comparing the experimental results, the numerical simulation result indicated that the failure mode of the failure of medium sand slope was retrogressive toe sliding, and the failure of fine sand slope was fluidized sliding. The simulation result is consistent with the model test and theoretical analysis, and grain sizes distribution caused different failure behavior of granular debris flows. This research should be a guide to explore the theory of debris flow and to improve the prevention and reduction of debris flow...|$|R
40|$|Sand-filled cracks {{from the}} Lower Fine-grained Quartzite of Dalradian (late Proterozoic) age on the Island of Islay, western Scotland, may {{be divided into}} two main types, both of which form {{orthogonal}} and non-orthogonal closed patterns on bedding surfaces. Type 1 cracks are short and lenticular in cross-section, contain sand which had been injected downwards, and are found on the bottoms of cross-laminated sandstone beds. Type 2 cracks cut several beds and preserve evidence of upward flow of water-saturated sand. Both types of crack developed through the interstratal intrusion of water-saturated <b>sand</b> into shrinkage <b>cracks</b> in mud or muddy sand, not, as previously thought, as a result of sub-aerial desiccation, or sub-aqueous cracking of the sediment surface (synaeresis). These cracks likely resulted from layer-parallel contraction caused by compaction of mudstone layers during burial. Seismic shock may have provided the trigger for the preferential development of polygonal crack patterns in these layers instead of the more usual small-scale dewatering structures. From a detailed comparison with published descriptions of filled cracks from a number of different geological environments, it is concluded that interstratal cracking is a mechanism which rivals sub-aerial desiccation in importance, and is more common in the geological record than is currently realized...|$|R
40|$|Sedimentary {{structures}} {{formed by}} the progressive primary infilling of thermal contraction <b>cracks</b> with <b>sand</b> are termed primary sand veins and sand wedges. In addition to simple vein- or wedge-shapes irregularities {{can be caused by}} sand veins branching from their sides and toes. Primary sand wedges form widely in sandy polar deserts, locally in sandy areas of tundra and probably in seasonally frozen ground. There are no unique criteria for distinguishing primary sand veins and wedges from sand veins and wedges of other origins. Identification of the former depends on the occurrence of distinctive features not always present and on evaluation of their lithofacies and palaeoenvironmental contexts. Care and caution are advocated in the use of ancient/relict primary sand veins and wedges as quantitative palaeoenvironmental indicators because modern active wedge distribution is poorly known and hence inferred thermal climatic threshold values are questionable. It is suggested that ancient/relict primary sand wedges exceeding 2 m in depth and with well-developed vertical lamination probably indicate the former occurrence of continuous permafrost, whereas sand veins and narrow <b>sand</b> wedges (frost <b>cracks)</b> are potentially ambiguous as they may form not only in the active layer above and within continuous permafrost but also in seasonally frozen ground in non-permafrost areas...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the common}} foams are a {{two-phase}} medium of gas and liquid with a particular structure consisting of gas pockets trapped in a network of thin liquid lms and plateau borders. Some well known foams are bubble baths, dishwater detergents and the foam head on beers. Many oils foam when trapped gas is suddenly released under conditions of an abrupt drop in pressure. In some re ners in which the through- ow of gas at high temperature and pressure is required to crack hydrocarbons, the gas-liquid mixtures will foam strongly. The foam traps gas with gas fractions of 80 % or higher. Clearly in such situations, {{in which it is}} desired that solid catalysts contact liquids, the production of foam is not wanted. In other applications, foams are useful; for example foams which havea high yield stress and {{can be used in a}} uid for carrying particles in applications ranging from the transport of cuttings in drilling and the placement of <b>sands</b> in <b>cracks</b> in oil producing reservoirs to increase the conductivity of reservoirs for secondary oil recovery. Obviously, bubble bath and shampoo companies should like to produce appropriate foams for dish and hair washing. Technologies which are impacted by foams and foaming are widespread. Foams are not well understood and they are very hard to control. A foam cannot be created without the vigorous introduction of gas from a bubbly mixture. Bubble baths and dishwater soap won't foam unless gas is stirred in by a water jet or another mixing mechanism. Foaming oils won't foam unless the drop in pressure is su ciently abrupt. To avoid a head of foam on beer it is necessary to pour the beer very slowly. To understand foaming it is necessary to try to be precise about the critical values of bubble release required to make and maintain a foam. All static foams are unstable, but some are more unstable than others. The stability of foams is another subject in which our understanding is far from complete. Foams collapse by draining and lm rupture. To keep a foa...|$|R
40|$|Coseismic {{effects may}} have a very short life; most of the <b>sand</b> boils and <b>cracks</b> {{triggered}} by the main shocks of the May 20 th and 29 th Emilia earthquakes have disappeared {{just a few days}} after, both because of the atmospheric agents, and due to human intervention. In order to create an accurate database of these small micro-morphologies, several photogrammetric surveys were carried out using digital reflex cameras. Fixing in three dimensions the impact that shocks have made on the landscape allows to extract many morphometric parameters with high precision and, in a relatively simple way. Structure From Motion (SFM) algorithms are well known computer vision technique for the ability of reconstruct sparse point cloud from overlapping photographs; when they are combined with fixed calibrated optical and complemented with robust stereo-matching algorithms, detailed three dimensional models can be built with great resolution and accuracy. In order to obtain high resolution DEMs several convergent images were taken trying to cover all the angles and the whole area of the object. The first step called alignment, the reconstruction of the photograph shooting position is done by SFM that detect some images key points and subsequently correlates the movement of these along the image sequence. Once the basically geometry of the scene is known, dense stereo matching algorithm processes the scene trying to correlate every pixel for each photo in order to reconstruct a dense point cloud. Finally the obtained point cloud is triangulated and a detailed mesh is constructed. In order to build a local reference system suitable for use in GIS different targets of known size were distributed around every scene and ground control points were collected. More zenithal pictures were used to orthophotos production. Using this methodology we were able to develop DEMs with resolutions ranging from one millimeter for the small forms to some centimeter for the big ones...|$|R
