50|$|Trimenia malagrida (<b>scarce</b> {{mountain}} <b>copper)</b> is {{a butterfly}} {{of the family}} Lycaenidae. It is found in South Africa, where it is found from Beaufort West to the Roggeveld escarpment in the Western Cape.|$|R
40|$|The {{modernisation}} {{of agriculture}} has lead {{to changes in}} Norwegian farming landscapes that have consequences for butterfly distribution and abundance. Particularly important is the abandonment of traditionally managed grasslands and the consequent increase in potential barriers of scrub and trees in the landscape. In this thesis I use a landscape ecological perspective to explore the effects of abandonment on butterfly dispersal. I demonstrate that landscape elements influence butterfly movement behaviour: tall structures were significant barriers {{for a range of}} species and even low features, such as roads, elicited significant behavioural responses which shaped the movement patterns of butterflies. Behavioural differences between species were related to ecological and physiological characteristics. Movement patterns of <b>Scarce</b> <b>Coppers</b> (Lyceana virgaureae) were recorded by mark-release- recapture (MRR) techniques. Of 1711 recorded displacements, over 90 % were under 150 m. Exchange rates between meadows were dependent upon distance and the structure of intervening vegetation. A simple spatial model, parameterised with data from the behavioural experiments, was validated using MRR observations. This confirmed that the behaviour of individuals responding to single landscape elements has consequences at the level of populations and entire landscapes. The life history and movement behaviour of the endangered Apollo (Parnassius apollo), were examined using MRR. The butterfly is well adapted to a mosaic landscape structure; however, inter-meadow movement declined exponentially with increasing distance between meadows. Abandonment of hay meadows on steep slopes, with consequent forest succession, will adversely affect the Apollo by increasing the distances between open habitat. Genetic analyses support the findings of MMR studies and add a wider spatial and temporal perspective. As a conservation management priority, I recommend population mapping to identify key sites in regional networks of populations. Finally, I consider the links between empirical studies, modelling and the practical application of theory, and discuss the implications of landscape change for the butterflies of Norwegian farmland...|$|R

50|$|Lycaena virgaureae lives preferably on flower-rich, dry {{and damp}} meadows in Central Europe. In Spain {{it is found}} in the Pyrenees and in the Cantabrian Mountains. In {{southern}} France it {{is found in the}} Massif Central. Its area of distribution reaches the Arctic Circle in Fennoscandia in the north; in the south it reaches north and northwest Greece. In Belgium there are a few threatened populations in the south of the country. It is not found, however, on the British Isles or the Netherlands. It can be found as far east as Mongolia. The <b>scarce</b> <b>copper</b> is found at elevations of 1,000 to 2,000 meters.|$|E

Nichols initially said he needed six thousand tons of silver, but neither of them could convert the weight to troy ounces. When Nichols said What {{difference does it make}} how we express the quantity Bell replied Young man, you may think of silver in tons, but the Treasury will always think of silver in troy ounces.|$|E
40|$|Chocolate has {{frequently}} been proposed to {{be a valuable}} source of dietary copper, but data on the copper content of major contemporary chocolate brands are <b>scarce.</b> The <b>copper</b> content of 22 brands of chocolate, {{many of which are}} sold worldwide, is thus presented here. A reliable hot ashing procedure to determine the copper content of chocolate by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy is also described. It was found that the copper contents of the chocolates analyzed here varied in the range of 1. 85 ± 0. 10 to 16. 50 ± 1. 29 μg/g. There was a linear correlation of the copper content of chocolate to its cocoa content with a correlation coefficient R 2 of 0. 89, showing that the copper was largely contributed to the chocolate by the cocoa. The value of chocolate as a source of dietary copper is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The war {{locomotives}} (or Kriegslokomotiven) {{were kept}} technically {{as simple as}} possible and the use of <b>scarce</b> materials (particularly <b>copper)</b> was dropped. Several German firms used prisoners from concentration camps as forced labour in the production of Kriegslokomotiven. Borsig Lokomotiv Werke (AEG) used forced labour from KL Auschwitz, Schichau-Werke used forced labor from KZ Stutthof, and its subcamps. DWM Posen (Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken Posen) took over Polish manufacturer H. Cegielski - Poznań and turned its workforce into forced labour. Oberschlesische Lokfabrik Krenau took over Polish manufacturer Fablok and used forced labour under threat of death. Identical engines were produced in Vienna, Kassel, Berlin, Munich, Stuttgart, Kirchen, Plzeň (Pilsen), and Strasbourg.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to examine the}} effect of Cu(II) on the {{degradation}} of thiram (Thi) in aqueous solutions, since the literature focused on this effect is <b>scarce</b> and <b>copper</b> based fungicides can be applied together with thiram or during the same season to agricultural crops. The effect of Cu(II) on the degradation of thiram was followed by both UV–vis and HPLC–MS/MS. When thiram is dissolved in pure water its degradation occurs very slowly, being negligible during the first 7 days. However, the presence of Cu(II) has a strong influence on the thiram degradation in aqueous solutions along time. In the presence of an excess of Cu(II), a [CuThi] 2 + complex is initially formed which degrades into a complex formed between the dimethyldithiocarbamate anion (DMDTC) and Cu(II) ion, [Cu(DMDTC) ]+. This complex further degrades leading to other copper complexes which were identified for the first time, by MSn. The results obtained in the present work also demonstrated that a redox reaction involving DMDTC anions and Cu(II) ions gives rise to the formation of a Thi–Cu(I) complex. Finally, some of the complexes resulting from the degradation of [CuThi] 2 + are quite persistent in solution {{for long periods of time}} (> 1 month) ...|$|R

5000|$|Besides silver {{coal mining}} also boomed {{in the early}} republican period. As coal mining was commonplace in industrialized Britain early British {{travellers}} {{had the opportunity to}} comment on Chilean coals before they were profitable. British travelers had differing opinions on the economic value of Chilean coals, or more specifically, the coals of Zona Central Sur (36-38° S). While David Barry found the coals to be of good quality, Charles Darwin held them of to be of little value. The British consul in Chile correctly predicted in 1825 that the area around the mouth of Biobío River would be a centre of coal industry. It was however not until the mid-19th century that large scale coal mining begun in the region. The initial trigger of coal mining was the arrival of steamships to the port of Talcahuano. These steam ships, most of whom were English, bought initially the coal very cheaply and the exploited coal seams were easy to work as they laid almost at ground level. Demand of coal stemmed not only from steam navigation but from the growth of copper mining in northern Chile. As wood in northern Chile became increasingly <b>scarce</b> <b>copper</b> smelters recurred to the coals found around Zona Central Sur. Demand from copper smelters proved in 1840s crucial to stabilize the coal business.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{transition}} metal copper {{is an essential}} trace element for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, intracellular free copper has to be strictly limited due to its toxic side effects, not least the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via redox cycling. Thus, all organisms have sophisticated copper homeostasis mechanisms that regulate uptake, distribution, sequestration and export of copper. From insects to mammals, metal-responsive transcription factor (MTF- 1), a zinc finger transcription factor, controls expression of metallothioneins and other components involved in heavy metal homeostasis. In the fruit fly Drosophila, MTF- 1 paradoxically acts as an activator under both high and low copper concentrations. Namely, under high copper conditions, MTF- 1 activates metallothioneins {{in order to protect}} the cell, while under low copper conditions MTF- 1 activates the copper importer Ctr 1 B in order to acquire <b>scarce</b> <b>copper</b> from the surroundings. This review highlights the current knowledge of copper homeostasis in eukaryotes with a focus on Drosophila and the role of MTF- 1...|$|E
50|$|Macrobotanical remains show us {{that the}} non-urban farmers {{cultivated}} domestic plants such as beans, maize, squash, sweet potatoes, peanuts, chili pepper, gourd, algorrobo and cotton. Storage facilities “revealed pollen spores from the fern and monocot families. These types of plants were likely used for medicinal purposes and/or as animal fodder”. The paleobotanical collection also has several wild species {{that could have been}} used for “fuel, building materials, animal fodder, medicine, and herbs”.Several types of lithic artifacts were discovered in and around Pampa Grande. The stone adzes, which were bifacially flaked with appendages in order to be hafted to wooden handles, were used for tilling and harvesting.

The differences in movement pattern between the two species were greater in terms of movement frequency than total distances. A comparison with results of published mark-release-recapture data for the two studied species and other butterflies, made evident the dominant impact {{of the size of the}} study area on mean movement distances. A comparison of the movement patterns of the same species (Maniola jurtina) in the two different study areas showed that dispersal differed between the two areas. Dispersal rates were much lower in the study area with a low amount of habitat. The factors influencing patch immigration differed between the two study areas. The dispersal functions fitting proportions of individuals that moved were also different, which can be important in the context of modelling movement. In marginal agricultural areas, abandonment is the greatest threat to semi-natural grasslands. Different degrees and patterns of abandonment were estimated to affect butterfly diversity and movement quite differently. This emphasises the importance of spatial planning for landscape change in agricultural areas in order to minimize negative impacts on species diversity...|$|E
